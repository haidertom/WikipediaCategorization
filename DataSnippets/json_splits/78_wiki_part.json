This may simply be referring to Gaul or related people; but this may be an inaccurate date since the inscription was erected in about 18 BCE despite referencing an earlier date. The term ''Germani'' shows up again, allegedly written by [[Poseidonios]] (from 80 BCE), but is merely a quotation inserted by the author [[Athenaios]] who wrote much later (around 190 CE).{{sfn|''The Imperial Teutonic Order''}}{{sfn|St\u00fcmpel|1932|p=60}} Somewhat later, the first surviving detailed discussions of Germani and Germania are those of [[Julius Caesar]], whose memoirs are based on first-hand experience.\n\nFrom Caesar's perspective, ''[[Germania]]'' was a geographical area of land on the east bank of the [[Rhine]] opposite Gaul, which Caesar left outside direct Roman control. This word provides the etymological origin of the modern concept of \"Germanic\" languages and Germany as a geographical abstraction. For some classical authors Germania also included regions of [[Sarmatia]], as well as an area under [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] control on the west bank of the Rhine. Additionally, in the south there were Celtic peoples still living east of the Rhine and north of the Alps. Caesar, Tacitus and others noted differences of culture which could be found on the east of the Rhine. But the theme of all these cultural references was that this was a wild and dangerous region, less civilized than Gaul, a place that required additional military vigilance.{{sfn|Heather|2012|pp=5\u20138}}\n\nCaesar used the term ''Germani'' for a very specific tribal grouping in northeastern [[Belgic]] [[Gaul]], west of the Rhine, the largest part of whom were the [[Eburones]]. He made clear that he was using the name in the local sense. These are the so-called ''[[Germani Cisrhenani]]'', whom Caesar believed to be closely related to the peoples east of the Rhine, and descended from immigrants into Gaul.<ref name=\"BG2.4\">''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=2:chapter=4&highlight=aduatuci 2.4]</ref> [[Tacitus]] suggests that this was the original meaning of the word \"''Germani''\" \u2013 as the name of a single tribal nation west of the Rhine, ancestral to the [[Tungri]] (who lived in the same area as the earlier ''Germani'' reported by Caesar), and not the name of a whole race (''gens'') as it came to mean. He also suggested that two large Belgic tribes neighbouring Caesar's ''Germani'', the [[Nervii]] and the [[Treveri]], liked to call themselves Germanic in his time, in order not to be associated with Gaulish indolence.<ref>\"''Germania''\" [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0083:chapter=2&highlight=tungrians chapter 2].</ref> Caesar described this group of tribes both as Belgic Gauls and as ''Germani''. Gauls are associated with Celtic languages, and the term ''Germani'' is associated with Germanic languages, but Caesar did not discuss languages in detail (though he did say that Belgic Gaul was different from Celtic Gaul in language). The geographer Ptolemy described the place where these people lived as ''Germania'', which according to his accounts was bordered by the Rhine, Vistula and Danube Rivers, but he also circumscribed into Greater ''Germania'' an area which included Jutland (Cimbrian peninsula) and an enormous island known as ''Scandia'' (the Scandinavian peninsula).{{sfn|Manco|2013|p=207}}\n\nWhile saying that the Germani had ancestry across the Rhine, Caesar did not describe these tribes as recent immigrants, saying that they had defended themselves some generations earlier from the invading [[Cimbri]] and [[Teutones]]. (He thereby distinguished them from the neighbouring [[Aduatuci]], whom he did not call ''Germani'', but who were descended from those Cimbri and Teutones.)<ref name=\"BG2.4\"/> It has been claimed, for example by [[Maurits Gysseling]], that the place names of this region show evidence of an early presence of Germanic languages, as early as the 2nd century BCE.{{sfn|Lamarcq|Rogge|1996|p=44}} The Celtic culture and language were however clearly influential also, as can be seen in the tribal name of the Eburones, their kings' names, [[Ambiorix]] and [[Cativolcus]], and also the [[material culture]] of the region.{{sfn|Lamarcq|Rogge|1996|p=47}}{{Efn|In these early records of apparent Germanic tribes, tribal leader names of the [[Cimbri]] and [[Sigambri]], and tribal names such as [[Tencteri]] and [[Usipetes]], are also apparently Gaulish, even coming from the east of the Rhine.}}\n\nThe etymology of the word ''Germani'' is uncertain. The likeliest theory so far proposed is that it comes from a [[Gaulish]] compound of *''ger'' \"near\" + *''mani'' \"men\", comparable to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''ger'' \"near\" (prep.), [[Old Irish]] ''gair'' \"neighbor\", [[Irish language|Irish]] ''gar-'' (prefix) \"near\", ''garach'' \"neighborly\".{{sfn|Schulze|2001|p=4}} Another Celtic possibility is that the name meant \"noisy\"; cf. [[Breton language|Breton]]/[[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''garm'' \"shout\", Irish ''gairm'' \"call\".{{sfn|Partridge|1966|p=1265}} However, here the vowel does not match, nor does the vowel length (contrast with inscriptional ''Garmangabi'' (UK) and ''Garma'' Alise, G-257)). Others have proposed a Germanic etymology *''g\u0113r''-''manni'', \"spear men\", cf. [[Middle Dutch]] ''ghere'', [[Old High German]] ''Ger'', [[Old Norse]] ''geirr''.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=245}} However, the form ''g\u0113r'' (from PGmc *''gaizaz'') seems far too advanced phonetically for the 1st century, has a long vowel where a short one is expected, and the Latin form has a simplex -''n''-, not a [[geminate]].\n\nThe term ''Germani'', therefore, probably applied to a small group of tribes in northeastern Gaul who may or may not have spoken a Germanic language, and whose links to ''Germania'' are unclear. It appears that the Germanic tribes did not have a word to describe themselves, although the word ''[[Suebi]]'', used by Caesar to broadly classify Germanic speakers, was likely Germanic in origin.{{Efn|See: L. R\u00fcbekeil, ''Suebica. V\u00f6lkernamen und Ethnos'', Innsbruck 1992, 187\u2013214.}} They did however use the term ''[[walhaz]]'' to describe outsiders (mainly Celts, Romans and Greeks).{{sfn|''The Imperial Teutonic Order''}} Roman authors frequently employed the term \"barbarian\" from the Latin derivative ''barbarus'' (inherited from the Greek ''barbaros'' which means \"foreign\") when describing Germanic peoples. Such a term presupposed a distinctive Roman intellectual and cultural superiority and their ethnographic treatises on the various barbarian tribes ascribed specific attributes of barbarism to each one so as to delineate the dichotomy between barbarism and civilization.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=15\u201316}} The more the Romans increased their presence along the periphery of their Empire, the more trade and employment for the barbarians became available, resulting in an economic boom along the corridors of the Danube River, which subsequently increased the Roman focus upon the Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=232\u2013233}} Use of the modern term German or Germanic is the result of 18th and 19th century classical philology which \"envisioned the Germanic language group as occupying a central branch of the Indo-European language tree.\"{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=19}}\n\n===Teutonic===\n{{Further|German language|Theodiscus|Teutonic (disambiguation)}}\nLatin scholars of the 10th century used the adjective ''teutonicus'' (a derivative of [[Teutones]]) when referencing [[East Francia]], which in their vernacular was connoted ''\"Regnum Teutonicum\"'', for that area and all of its subsequent inhabitants. Modern speakers of English still use the word \"Teutons\" to describe Germanic peoples.{{sfn|''The Imperial Teutonic Order''}} Historically, the Teutones were only one specific tribe, and may not even have spoken a Germanic language. For example, some scholars postulate that the original Teutonic language may have been a form of Celtic.{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=224}} The source of this confusion, whereby Teutons are lumped into the same category as German-speaking tribes, comes from their contact with the Romans in the 2nd century BCE, when they, along with the Cimbri and the Ambrones, led a frightening attack against the Romans. Teuton was the byword the Romans applied to the barbarians from the north and which they used to describe subsequent Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Detwiler|1999|p=3}} Under the leadership of [[Gaius Marius]], who built his career on barbarian antagonists (like many who followed), the Teutones became one of the archetypal enemies of the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Germanic dialects ca.

The largest, he says, is the [[Semnones]], the [[Langobardi]] are fewer, but living surrounded by warlike peoples, and in remoter and better defended areas live the [[Reudigni]], [[Aviones]], [[Anglii]], [[Varini]], [[Eudoses]], the [[Suardones]], and [[Nuithones]].<ref>Tac.

He is also slightly more specific about the position of the Istvaeones, though he also does not name any examples of them:\n\n{{bquote|There are five German races; the Vandili, parts of whom are the [[Burgundiones]], the [[Varini]], the [[Carini (Germanic tribe)|Carini]], and the [[Gutones]]: the Ing\u00e6vones, forming a second race, a portion of whom are the Cimbri, the Teutoni, and the tribes of the [[Chauci]]. The Ist\u00e6vones, who join up to the Rhine, and to whom the Cimbri [sic, repeated] belong, are the third race; while the Hermiones, forming a fourth, dwell in the interior, and include the Suevi, the [[Hermunduri]], the [[Chatti]], the [[Cherusci]], {{Efn|The Cherusci people are the progenitors of [[Arminius]], who once a Roman general, betrayed his erstwhile Roman legions by attacking them using the combined forces of Germanic tribes in 9 CE at Teutoberg Forest, a move which ended the Roman Empire's efforts to expand east of the Rhine.{{sfn|Ozment|2005|pp=20\u201321}} }} and the Peucini, who are also the Bastern\u00e6, adjoining the [[Dacians|Daci]].}}\n\nThe remote Varini are listed by Tacitus as being in the Suebic or Hermionic group by Tacitus, above, but by Pliny in the eastern Vandalic or Gothic group, so the two accounts do not match perfectly.\n\nThese accounts and others from the period often emphasise that the Suebi and their Hermione kin formed an especially large and mobile nation, which at the time were living mainly near the Elbe, both east and west of it, but they were also moving westwards into the lands near the Roman frontier. Pomponius Mela in his slightly earlier ''Description of the World''<ref>III.3.31</ref> places \"the farthest people of [[Germania]], the Hermiones\" somewhere to the east of the [[Cimbri]] and the [[Teutones]], and further from Rome, apparently on the Baltic. Strabo however describes the Suebi as going through a period where they were pushed back east by the Romans, in the direction from which they had come:\n\n{{bquote|the nation of the Suevi is the most considerable, as it extends from the Rhine as far as the Elbe, and even a part of them, as the Hermonduri and the Langobardi, inhabit the country beyond the Elbe; but at the present time these tribes, having been defeated, have retired entirely beyond the Elbe.<ref>Geography [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0239:book=7:chapter=1 7.1]</ref>}}\n\nBy the end of the 5th century the term \"Gothic\" was used more generally in the historical sources for Pliny's \"Vandals\" to the east of the Elbe, including not only the [[Goths]] and [[Vandals]], but also \"the [[Gepids]] along the Tisza and the [[Danube]], the [[Rugians]], [[Scirii|Sciri]] and [[Burgundians]], even the Iranian [[Alans]].\"{{sfn|''The Imperial Teutonic Order''}}\n\n==Linguistics==\n{{Further|Germanic substrate hypothesis|Proto-Germanic|Spread of Indo-European languages}}\n\nLinguists postulate that an early proto-Germanic language existed and was distinguishable from the other Indo-European languages as far back as 500 BCE.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=300}} The earliest known Germanic inscription was found at Negau (in what is now southern [[Austria]]) on a bronze helmet dating back to the first century BCE.{{sfn|Todd|1999|pp=12\u201313}} Some of the other earliest known physical records of the Germanic language appear on stone and wood carvings in [[Runic]] script from around 200 CE.{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=224}} Runic writing likely disappeared due to the concerted opposition of the Christian Church, which regarded runic text as heathen symbols which supposedly contained inherent magical properties that they associated with the Germanic peoples' pagan past.{{sfn|Halsall|1981|p=15}} Unfortunately, this primitive view ignores the abundance of \"pious runic writing found on church-related objects\" (ranging from inscriptions in the doorways of churches, on church bells and even those found on baptismal fonts) when Christianity was introduced into the Germanic North.{{sfn|Antonsen|2002|p=37}}{{Efn|As late as the 10th century there is evidence of runic writing on a stone monument erected by the first Christian king of Denmark, [[Harald Bluetooth]]. In the text, Harald honors his parents using runic script and on the other side of the stone is a depiction of 'Christ in His Glory', incorporating a runic inscription which extolls Harald for acquiring Denmark and Norway and for converting the Danes into Christians. See: Moltke (1985). ''Runes and Their Origin: Denmark and Elsewhere'', pp. 207\u2013220.}} An important linguistic step was made by the Christian convert [[Ulfilas]], who became a bishop to the Visigoths in CE 341; he subsequently invented an alphabet and translated the scriptures from Greek into Gothic, creating the earliest known translation of the Bible into a Germanic language.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=44}}\n\nFrom what is known, the early Germanic tribes may have spoken \"[[mutually intelligible]] dialects\" derived from a common parent language but there are no written records to verify this fact. Despite their common linguistic framework, by the 5th century CE, the Germanic people were linguistically differentiated and could no longer easily comprehend one another.{{sfn|Musset|1993|pp=12\u201313}} Nonetheless, the line between Germanic languages and Romance speakers in central Europe remained at the western mouth of the Rhine river and while Gaul fell under German domination and was firmly settled by the Franks, the linguistic patterns did not move much. Further west and south in Europe-proper, the linguistic presence of the Germanic languages is almost negligible. Despite the fact that the Visigoths ruled what is now Spain for upwards of 250 years, there are almost no recognizable Gothic words borrowed into Spanish.{{sfn|Ostler|2006|p=307}}\n\nThe Germanic tribes moved and interacted over the next centuries, and separate dialects among [[Germanic languages]] developed down to the present day.{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=224\u2013225}} Some groups, such as the Suebians, have a continuous recorded existence, and so there is a reasonable confidence that their modern dialects can be traced back to those in classical times.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|pp=194\u2013195}} By extension, but sometimes controversially, the names of the sons of [[Mannus]], [[Istvaeones]], [[Irminones]], and [[Ingvaeones]], are also sometimes used to divide up the medieval and modern [[West Germanic languages]].{{sfn|''The Imperial Teutonic Order''}} The more easterly groups such as the Vandals are thought to have been united in the use of [[East Germanic languages]], the most famous of which is [[Gothic (language)|Gothic]]. The dialect of the Germanic people who remained in Scandinavia is not generally called Ingvaeonic, but is classified as [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]], which developed into [[Old Norse]]. Within the West Germanic group, linguists associate the Suebian or Hermionic group with an \"Elbe Germanic\" which developed into [[Upper German]], including modern [[German language|German]].{{sfn|Ostler|2006|pp=304\u2013314}}\n\nMore speculatively, given the lack of any such clear explanation in any classical source, modern linguists sometimes designate the [[Frankish language]] (and its descendant [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) as [[Istvaeonic]], although the geographical term \"[[Weser]]-[[Rhine]] Germanic\" is often preferred. However, the classical \"''Germani''\" near the Rhine, to whom the term was originally applied by Caesar, may not have even spoken Germanic languages, let alone a language recognizably ancestral to modern Dutch.{{sfn|Wightman|1985|pp=12\u201314}} The close relatives of Dutch, [[Low German]], [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Frisian languages|Frisian]], are in fact sometimes designated as [[Ingvaeonic]], or alternatively, \"North-Sea Germanic\". Frankish, (and later Dutch, Luxembourgish and the Frankish dialects of German in Germany) has continuously been intelligible to some extent with both \"Ingvaeonic\" Low German, and some \"Suebian\" High German dialects, with which they form a spectrum of continental dialects. All these dialects or languages appear to have formed by the mixing of migrating peoples after the time of Caesar. So it is not clear if these medieval dialect divisions correspond to any mentioned by Tacitus and Pliny. Indeed, in Tacitus ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0083:chapter=40&highlight=anglii Tac.

This ushered in the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]].{{sfn|''The Imperial Teutonic Order''}}  Stretching from central France all the way to western Hungary and then from the Alps to central Poland, the Hallstatt culture also constructed sophisticated structures and the archaeological remains across parts of France, Germany and Hungary suggest their trade networks along the North Atlantic, Baltic Sea and up and down central Europe's river valleys were fairly elaborate as well.{{sfn|Cunliffe|2011|p=309\u2013316}}\n\n===Early Iron Age===\n{{Further|Pre-Roman Iron Age}}\n\nThe earliest sites at which Germanic peoples ''per se'' have been documented are in Northern Europe, in what now constitutes the plains of Denmark and southern Sweden. However, in even this region, the population had been, according to Waldman & Mason, \"remarkably stable\" \u2013 as far back as the Neolithic Age, when humans first began controlling their environment through the use of agriculture and the domestication of animals.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=296\u2013297}} Given this stability, the population of the region necessarily preceded the arrival in Europe of the precursors of the Germanic languages \u2013 which most likely began with the [[Corded Ware culture]].\n\nDuring the 2nd millennium BCE, the so-called [[Nordic Bronze Age|Nordic Bronze Age culture]] expanded eastward into the adjacent regions between the estuaries of the Elbe and Oder rivers.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=5}}\n\nAs early as 750 BCE, archeological evidence gives the impression that the proto-Germanic population was becoming more uniform in its culture.{{sfn|''The Imperial Teutonic Order''}} The Germanic peoples at the time inhabited southern Scandinavia and the Northern Sea and Baltic coasts from modern-day [[Netherlands]] to the [[Vistula]].{{sfn|Germanic languages: The Emergence of Germanic Languages, ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online''}} As this population grew, it migrated south-west, into coastal floodplains due to the exhaustion of the soil in its original settlements.{{sfn|Verhart|2006|pp=81\u201382}} \n\nBy approximately 250 BCE, additional expansion further southwards into central Europe had begun to take place and five general groups of Germanic people emerged, each employing distinct linguistic dialects but sharing similar language innovations \u2014 they are distinguished from one another as: ''North Germanic'' in southern Scandinavia; ''North Sea Germanic'' in the regions along the North Sea and in the Jutland peninsula NW Europe, which forms the mainland of Denmark together with the north German state of Schleswig-Holstein; ''Rhine-Weser Germanic'' along the middle Rhine and Weser river (which empties into the North Sea near Bremerhaven); ''Elbe Germanic'' spoken by the people living directly along the middle Elbe river; and ''East Germanic'' between the middle of the Oder and the Vistula rivers.{{Efn|See: ''The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 15th edition, 22: pp. 641\u2013642.}}\n\nConcomitantly, during the 2nd century BCE the advent of the [[Celts|Celtic culture]] of [[Hallstatt]] and [[La Tene]] arose in nearby territories further west but the interactions between the early Germanic people and the Celts is thought to have been minimal based on the linguistic evidence.{{sfn|Verhart|2006|p=67}} Despite the absence of the Celtic influence further eastwards, there are a number of Celtic loanwords in Proto-Germanic, which at the very least indicates contact between the people of Gaul and the early Germanic cultures that resided along the [[Rhine]] river.{{sfn|Well|1996|pp=603\u2013611}} Nonetheless, material objects such as metal ornaments and pottery found near the areas east of the lower Rhine are connoted as [[Jastorf culture|Jastorf]] in nomenclature and are characteristically distinguishable from the Celtic objects found further west.{{sfn|Bogucki|Crabtree, eds.

However, the archaeological evidence in some of the regions creates an ethnographic problem in clearly delineating the indigenous people based strictly on Roman classification. Nonetheless, there are scholars who assert that there was an eventual linguistic \"Germanization\" that occurred during the 1st century BCE through something they call the \"elite-dominance\" model.{{sfn|Hachmann|Kossack|Kuhn|1962|pp=183\u2013212}} Archaeologists are unable to make definitive judgments which accord the observations of the Roman writer Tacitus.

Evidence suggest that these were Germanized rather than displaced.{{sfn|Germany: Ancient History, ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online''}} West Germanic people eventually settled in central Europe and became more accustomed to agriculture and it is the various western Germanic people that are described by Caesar and Tacitus. Meanwhile, the eastern Germanic people continued their migratory habits.{{sfn|Bury|2000|pp=7\u20139}} Roman writers characteristically organized and classified people and it may very well have been deliberate on their part to recognize the tribal distinctions of the various Germanic people so as to pick out known leaders and exploit these differences for their benefit. For the most part however, these early Germanic people shared a basic culture, operated similarly from an economic perspective, and were not nearly as differentiated as the Romans implied. In fact, the Germanic tribes are hard to distinguish from the Celts on many accounts simply based on archaeological records.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=301}}\n\n===Pytheas===\nOne of the earliest known written records of the Germanic world in classical times was in the lost work of [[Pytheas]]).  Pytheas traveled to northern Europe, some time in the late 4th century BCE, and his observations about the geographical environment, traditions and culture of the northern European populations became a central source of information for later historians - often the only source.{{Efn|Ancient authors we know by name who saw Pytheas' text were [[Dicaearchus]], [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], [[Eratosthenes]], [[Crates of Mallus]], [[Hipparchus]], [[Polybius]], [[Artemidorus Ephesius|Artemidorus]] and [[Posidonius]], as Lionel Pearson remarked in reviewing Hans Joachim Mette, ''Pytheas von Massalia'' (Berlin: Gruyter) 1952, in ''Classical Philology'' '''49'''.3 (July 1954), pp. 212\u2013214.}} Authors such as [[Strabo]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Diodorus]] cite Pytheas in disbelief, although Pytheas' observations appear to have been accurate. Though Pytheas was not the first Mediterranean to explore those lands (note for example [[Himilco]] (5th century BCE), and possibly [[Massaliote Periplus|Phoenicians]] and [[Massaliote Periplus|Tartessians]] ({{circa | 6th century BCE}}), his became the first substantial surviving description of these populations. Much of the Germanic peoples' early history enters into view through Pytheas, particularly since he was also possibly the first to distinguish the ''Germanoi'' people of northern and central Europe as distinct from the ''Keltoi'' people further west.{{sfn|Osborne|2008|p=38}}{{sfn|Cunliffe|2011|pp=6\u20138}} Along with the records of a couple of other classical writers (namely [[Polybius]] (2nd century BCE) and [[Posidonius]] (c. 135 BCE \u2013 c. 51 BCE), the work of Pytheas on the Celts and early Germans influenced scores of future geographers, historians and ethnographers.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=51\u201352}}\n\n[[File:Cimbrians and Teutons invasions.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|Migrations of the [[Cimbri]] and the [[Teutons]] (late 2nd century BCE) and their [[Cimbrian War|war with Rome]] (113\u2013101 BCE)]]\n\n===Bastarnae===\n{{Main|Bastarnae}}\nAn early Germanic  people known as the Bastarnae were identified by Roman authors and were allegedly the first to reach the Graeco-Roman world, living in the area north of the Danube's mouth in the [[Black Sea]].

They rank in the number of the gods those alone whom they behold, and by whose instrumentality they are obviously benefited, namely, the sun, fire, and the moon; they have not heard of the other deities even by report. Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in the pursuits of the military art; from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue and hardships. Those who have remained [[chaste]] for the longest time, receive the greatest commendation among their people; they think that by this the growth is promoted, by this the physical powers are increased and the sinews are strengthened. And to have had knowledge of a woman before the twentieth year they reckon among the most disgraceful acts; of which matter there is no concealment, because they bathe promiscuously in the rivers and [only] use skins or small cloaks of deer's hides, a large portion of the body being in consequence naked.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>They do not pay much attention to agriculture, and a large portion of their food consists in milk, cheese, and flesh; nor has any one a fixed quantity of land or his own individual limits; but the magistrates and the leading men each year apportion to the tribes and families, who have united together, as much land as, and in the place in which, they think proper, and the year after compel them to remove elsewhere. For this enactment they advance many reasons-lest seduced by long-continued custom, they may exchange their ardor in the waging of war for agriculture; lest they may be anxious to acquire extensive estates, and the more powerful drive the weaker from their possessions; lest they construct their houses with too great a desire to avoid cold and heat; lest the desire of wealth spring up, from which cause divisions and discords arise; and that they may keep the common people in a contented state of mind, when each sees his own means placed on an equality with [those of] the most powerful.{{Efn|This derives from Gaius Julius Caesar, ''Commentarii De Bello Gallico'', VI.

Caesar was wary of these barbaric people of ''Germania'' and invoked the threat of expansions such as that by [[Ariovistus]]' [[Suebi]] as justification for his brutal campaigns to annex Gaul to Rome in 58\u201351 BCE.{{sfn|Pagden|2001|p=22}} \n\nAn intense Roman militarization, greater than ever before, was begun under Caesar to deal with the barbarian tribes along the frontier \u2014 particularly since he feared that the Celtic Gauls between Rome and the Germanic people would not be able to defend themselves.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=302}} One major Celtic people who were forced from their homeland in modern southwest Germany and Bohemia were the [[Boii]], a migration which had major impacts on Rome and many other peoples.

Lands to the north and east of the Rhine emerge in the Roman records under the name ''[[Germania]]''.

More instances of ''Germani'' fighting ''Germani'' appear in the works of Tacitus than between Romans and ''Germani''.{{sfn|Pohl|2002|p=16}} But it was Caesar's wars against the Germanic people that helped establish and solidify the use of the term ''Germania''.

In 9 CE, a revolt of their Germanic subjects headed by the supposed Roman ally, [[Arminius]], (along with his decisive defeat of [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] and the destruction of 3 Roman legions in the surprise attack on the Romans at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]) ended in the withdrawal of the Roman frontier to the Rhine.

Germanic expansions during early Roman times are known only generally, but it is clear that the forebears of the [[Goths]] were settled on the southern [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] shore by 100 CE. According to historian Thomas Burns, major hostilities between the external Germanic peoples of the north and Rome did not commence in \"earnest\" until the reign of [[Trajan]] (CE 98\u2014117), who used the \"full weight of Roman might\" to attack the Dacians.{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=183}}\n\nIn the absence of large-scale political unification, such as that imposed forcibly by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] upon the peoples of [[Italy]], the various tribes remained free, led by their own hereditary or chosen leaders. Once Rome faced significant threats on its borders, some of the Germanic tribes who once guarded its periphery chose solace within the Roman empire itself, implying that enough assimilation and cross-cultural pollination had occurred for their societies not only to cooperate, but to live together in some cases. The 4th century Gothic Tervingi are most famous among scholars of classical Rome and pre-modern Europe because the majority of them sought asylum inside the heart of the Roman Empire in 376 CE.{{sfn|Heather|2012|p=594}}{{Efn|The texts of the chronicler Marcellinus demonstrate that, at the very least, military cooperation between the Germanic tribes and the Romans took place at times since he makes reference to a \"''pactum vicissitudinus reddendae''\".{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=10}} }}\n\nBy the middle to late second century CE, migrating Germanic tribes like the Marcomanni and Quadi pushed their way to the Roman frontier along the Danube corridor, movements of people which resulted in conflicts known as the [[Marcomannic Wars]]; these conflicts ended in approximately CE 180.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=304}} Not long thereafter, larger confederations of Germanic people appeared, groups led by tribal leaders acting as would-be kings. The first of these conglomerations mentioned in the historical sources were the Alamanni (a term meaning \"all men\") who appear in Roman texts sometime in the 3rd century CE.{{sfn|Geary|1999|p=109}} This change indicated that the tribalism of the Germanic people was being abandoned for consolidated rule. Meanwhile, Rome adapted itself due to the arrival of the Germanic tribes. Emperor [[Severus Alexander]] was killed by his own soldiers in CE 235 for example (for negotiating peace with the tribes of ''Germania'' through diplomacy and bribery against the wishes of his men) and the general [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximin]] elected in his place. Maximin was himself not Roman but was ethnically the child of a Germanic Alan and a Goth.

Close to the same time that the Goths were fighting the Romans in the Baltics, there is also the first mention of the Franks around CE 250.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=304\u2013305}} Perennial internal conflicts among several successive emperors of both the eastern and western Empire during the 4th century CE resulted in civil wars and damaged the overall quality of the Roman army; the fighting also depleted the elite from within their officer corps.  To compensate for their losses the Romans recruited inferior untried Roman civilians and sought replacements from across the frontier region by militarily proficient barbarian troops, a development which further strengthened the position of the Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Collins |1999|p=46}} Attempting to control the periphery of the Roman empire meant finding innovative ways of dealing with the Germanic people, so the Romans enlisted them as ''foederati'' (federates) and by the late fourth century, the majority of the Roman military was made up of Germanic warriors. Federating whole tribes of Germanic people into the Empire marked a whole new phase of encroachment and facilitated the fragmentation of Rome from within its own borders.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=61}}\n\nAmong the Romans, the Germanic presence in the military was so extensive for example, that the word ''barbarus'' became a synonym for \"soldier\" and the imperial budget of the military was known as the ''ficus barbarus''.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=305\u2013306}} Barbarians (Germanics) composed the mobile army of emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] with many of them, particularly the more organized ones like the Franks and Alamanni, reaching levels of high command. An example of such prominence shows in the fact that in CE 350 the Frankish general Silvanus was the high military commander of Gaul.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=306}} Warriors and leaders among the Germanic peoples had an advantage over their Roman counterparts as they knew and could dexterously traverse both worlds, whereas the Romans despised barbarian culture and customs and were unable to secure trust amid the Germanic soldiers on their payrolls.

While the rulers in the Eastern Empire were able to endure the frequent clashes without serious consequences to their territorial dominion, this was not the case in the Western Empire. For upwards of two centuries, the Roman emperors fought and confined the Germanic tribes to Rhine-Danube frontier and in far-away Britain, but all that changed in CE 378 when the Visigoths destroyed as much as two-thirds of the Roman army of the East under emperor Valens.{{sfn|Katz|1955|p=88}} Roman historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] referred to the damage inflicted by the Germanic tribes at Adrianople as an \"irreparable disaster\" and ended his account of Roman history with this battle. Subsequent historians like Sir [[Edward Gibbon]] (among others) ascribe a similar significance to this event and call the [[Battle of Adrianople]] a watershed moment between the ancient world and the medieval one that followed; for not only did this battle reveal Rome's weakness to the Germanic tribes and inspire them accordingly, never again were they to leave Roman soil.{{sfn|Katz|1955|pp=88\u201389}} Evidence of the trauma suffered at the hands of the ransacking Visigoths shows up in the writings of the former bishop of [[Milan]], [[Ambrose]], who wrote about melting down golden church plates early in his episcopate so as to help the victims of the calamity at Adrianople.{{sfn|Brown|2012|p=128}}\n\n===Migration Period===\n{{Further|Migration Period}}\n[[File:Karte v\u00f6lkerwanderung.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|2nd century to 5th century simplified migrations]]\n\nBefore considering the later migration of various Germanic peoples in the 5th century, it is worth noting that the first recorded great migration of a Germanic tribe occurred sometime at the end of the 2nd century when the Goths left the lower Vistula for the shores of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=16}} For the next couple hundred years, the restless Goths were a menace to the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Bury|2000|pp=16\u201333}} Between the 2nd and 4th centuries the Goths slowly filtered deeper into the south and eastwards, making their way to what is now Kiev in Ukraine and pressuring Rome in the process.{{sfn|Kishlansky|Geary|O'Brien|2008|p=166}} The arrival of the nomadic Huns along the [[Black Sea]] corridor in CE 375 further accelerated the Goth's exodus across the Roman border.{{sfn|Manco|2013|p=204}} Germanic people from the northern coasts of Europe had been making their way into Britain for several centuries before the larger-scale incursions took place.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=26}}\n\nBy the 5th century CE, the Western Roman Empire was losing military strength and political cohesion; numerous Germanic peoples, under pressure from population growth and invading Asian groups, began migrating en masse in far and diverse directions, taking them to [[Great Britain]] and far south through present day [[Continental Europe]] to the [[Mediterranean]] and northern [[Africa]]. Over time, this wandering meant intrusions into other tribal territories, and the ensuing wars for land escalated with the dwindling amount of unoccupied territory. Roaming tribes of Germanic people then began staking out permanent homes as a means of protection. Much of this resulted in fixed settlements from which many, under a powerful leader, expanded outwards.{{sfn|James|1995|pp=60\u201367}} Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and Lombards made their way into Italy; Vandals, Burgundians, Franks, and Visigoths conquered much of Gaul; Vandals and Visigoths also pushed into Spain; Vandals additionally made it into North Africa; the Alamanni established a strong presence in the middle Rhine and Alps.{{sfn|Drinkwater|2007|p=81}} In [[Denmark]] the [[Jutes]] merged with the [[Daner|Danes]], in [[Sweden]] the [[Geats]] and [[Gutes]] merged with the [[Swedish people|Swedes]].

Instead, it has been confirmed that the Frisian graves had been used without interruption between the 4th and 9th centuries and that inhabited areas show continuity with the Roman period in revealing coins, jewellery and ceramics of the 5th century.

(See: Heather, Peter. (2012) ''Empires and Barbarians: The Fall of Rome and the Birth of Europe''). Conversely, historian Bryan Ward-Perkins paints a different picture altogether.

The two titles alone speak to their divergent positions.}} Germanic tribes nonetheless fought against Roman dominance when necessary. When the Roman Empire refused to allow the Visigoths to settle in Noricum for instance, they responded by sacking Rome in CE 410 under the leadership of [[Alaric I]].{{sfn|Davies|1998|p=229}} Oddly enough, Alaric I did not see his imposition in Rome as an attack against the Roman Empire per se but as an attempt to gain a favorable position within its borders, particularly since the Visigoths held the Empire in high regard.{{sfn|Bury|2000|pp=65\u201366}}\n\nAlaric certainly had no intentions to destroy the great city which was symbolic of Roman power, but he needed to pay his army and the spoils of the city not only afforded the ability to do that, its wealth made him \"the richest general in the empire.\"{{sfn|Brown|2012|p=294}} For the next year, Alaric extracted vast sums from the city; this included 5,000 pounds of gold, 30,000 pounds of silver, 5,000 pounds of oriental pepper, gilded statues from the Forum, and even the one-ton solid silver dome which Constantine once placed over the baptismal basin next to the Lateran basilica.{{sfn|Brown|2012|pp=294\u2013295}}  Not only was Alaric able to bleed Rome, he also established a Gothic confederation consisting of Theruingian and Greuthungic peoples, and he played the eastern and western Roman Empires off against one another for his benefit.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nAt about the same time Alaric was sacking the Empire's capital, there was a Roman exodus from the British Isles, a departure which provided the Germanic Angles and Saxons the opportunity to occupy and control the eastern coastlands of Britain, the southern regions of Sussex, and move into the valley of the Thames.{{sfn|Davies|1998|pp=231\u2013232}} While Germanic tribes overran the once western Roman provinces, they also continued to strive for regional ascendancy closer to Rome's center; meanwhile the threat along the periphery from the Huns created additional difficulties for the Empire.{{sfn|Davies|1998|p=232}}\n\nIndividuals and small groups from Germanic tribes had long been recruited from the territories beyond the ''[[limes]]'' (i.e., the regions just outside the Roman Empire), and some of them had risen high in the command structure of the army. The Rhine and Danube provided the bulk of geographic separation for the Roman ''limes''. On one side of the ''limes'' stood 'Latin' Europe, law, Roman order, prosperous trading markets, towns and everything that constituted modern civilization for that era; while on the other side stood barbarism, technical backwardness, illiteracy and a tribal society of fierce warriors.{{sfn|Roberts|1997|pp=146\u2013147}} Then the Empire recruited entire tribal groups under their native leaders as military officers. Historian Evangelos Chrysos argues the implications concerning the recruitment of the barbarians into the Roman army during the migration period were enormous and relates that:<blockquote>it offered them experience of how the imperial army was organized, how the government arranged the military and functional logistics of their involvement as soldiers or officers and how it administered their practical life, how the professional expertise and the social values of the individual soldier were cultivated in the camp and on the battlefield, how the ideas about the state and its objectives were to be implemented by men in uniform, how the Empire was composed and how it functioned at an administrative level. This knowledge of and experience with the Romans opened to individual members of the ''gentes'' a path which, once taken, would lead them to more or less substantial affiliation or even solidarity with the Roman world. To take an example from the economic sphere: The service in the Roman army introduced the individual or corporate members into the monetary system of the Empire since quite a substantial part of their salary was paid to them in cash. With money in their hands the \"guests\" were by necessity exposed to the possibility of taking part in the economic system, of becoming accustomed to the rules of the wide market, of absorbing the messages of or reacting to the imperial propaganda passed to the citizens through the legends on the coins. In addition the goods offered in the markets influenced and transformed the newcomers' food and aesthetic tastes and their cultural horizon. Furthermore Roman ''civilitas'' was an attractive goal for every individual wishing to succeed in his social advancement.{{sfn|Chrysos|2003|pp=13\u201314}}</blockquote> Assisting with defense eventually shifted into administration and then outright rule, as Roman government passed into the hands of Germanic leaders. [[Odoacer]] (who commanded the German mercenaries in Italy){{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=307}} deposed [[Romulus Augustulus]], the last emperor of the West in CE 476.{{sfn|Ward-Perkins|2005|p=64}} Odoacer ruled from Rome and Ravenna, restored the Colosseum and assigned seats to senatorial dignitaries as part of the process of consolidating his rule.{{sfn|O'Donnell|2008|p=105}} The presence of [[successor state]]s controlled by a [[nobility]] from one of the Germanic tribes is evident in the 6th century \u2013 even in Italy, the former heart of the Empire, where [[Odoacer]] was followed by [[Theodoric the Great]], king of the [[Ostrogoths]], who was regarded by Roman citizens and Gothic settlers alike as legitimate successor to the rule of [[Rome]] and [[Italy]].{{sfn|Santosuo|2004|pp=13\u201315}} Theodoric ruled from CE 493\u2013526, twice as long as his predecessor, and his rule is evidenced by an abundance of documents.{{sfn|O'Donnell|2008|pp=105\u2013107}} Under the Ostrogoths a considerable degree of Roman and Germanic cultural and political fusion was achieved.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=308}} Germanic kings worked in-tandem with Roman administrators to the extent possible to help ensure a smooth transition and to facilitate the profitable administration of once Roman lands.{{sfn|Ward-Perkins|2005|pp=69\u201370}} Slowly but surely, the distinction between Germanic rulers and Roman subjects faded, followed by varying degrees of \"cultural assimilation\" which included the adoption of the Gothic language by some of the indigenous people of the former Roman Empire but this was certainly not ubiquitous as Gothic identity still remained distinctive.{{sfn|Ward-Perkins|2005|p=72}} Theodoric may have tried too hard to accommodate the various people under his dominion; indulging \"Romans and Goths, Catholics and Arians, Latin and barbarian culture\" resulted in the eventual failure of the Ostrogothic reign and the subsequent \"end of Italy as the heartland of late antiquity.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=332}}\n\nAccording to noted historian Herwig Wolfram, the Germanic peoples did not and could not \"conquer the more advanced Roman world\" nor were they able to \"restore it as a political and economic entity\"; instead, he asserts that the empire's \"universalism\" was replaced by \"tribal particularism\" which gave way to \"regional patriotism\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=308}} Nonetheless, the entry of the Germanic tribes deep into the heart of Europe and the subsequent collapse of the western Roman Empire resulted in a \"massive disruption\" to long established communication networks, a system that had in many ways \"bound much of the continent together for centuries.\"{{sfn|Cunliffe|2011|p=442}} Trade networks and routes shifted accordingly, Germanic kingdoms and peoples established boundaries and it was not until the appearance of the Arabs in Iberia and into Anatolia that Europeans began reestablishing their networks to deal with a new threat.{{sfn|Cunliffe|2011|pp=442\u2013444}}\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n[[File:Franks expansion.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|Frankish expansion from the early kingdom of [[Clovis I]] (481) to the divisions of [[Carolingian Empire|Charlemagne's Empire]] (843/870).]]\nThe transition of the [[Migration period]] to the [[Middle Ages]] proper took place over the course of the second half of the 1st millennium. It was marked by the [[Christianization of the Germanic peoples]] and the formation of stable [[Germanic monarchy|kingdoms]] replacing the mostly tribal structures of the Migration period. Some of this stability is discernible in the fact that the Pope recognized Theodoric's reign when the Germanic conqueror entered Rome in CE 500, despite that Theodoric was a known practitioner of Arianism, a faith which the Council of Nicaea condemned in CE 325.{{sfn|Heather|2014|pp=58\u201359}} Theodoric's Germanic subjects and administrators from the Roman Catholic Church cooperated in serving him, helping establish a codified system of laws and ordinances which facilitated the integration of the Gothic peoples into a burgeoning empire, solidifying their place as they appropriated a Roman identity of sorts.{{sfn|Heather|2014|pp=61\u201368}} The foundations laid by the Empire enabled the successor Germanic kingdoms to maintain a familiar structure and their success can be seen as part of the lasting triumph of Rome.{{sfn|Pohl|1997|p=33}}\n[[File:British kingdoms c 800.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Anglo-Saxon and British kingdoms c. 800]]\n\nIn continental Europe, this Germanic evolution saw the rise of [[Francia]] in the [[Merovingian period]] under the rule of [[Clovis I]] who had deposed the last emperor of Gaul, eclipsing lesser kingdoms such as [[Alemannia]].{{sfn|Kitchen|1996|pp=19\u201320}} The Merovingians controlled most of Gaul under Clovis, who, through conversion to Christianity, allied himself with the Gallo-Romans.

In [[Scandinavia]], there is a long history of assimilation of and by the [[Sami people]] and [[Finnic peoples]], namely [[Finns]] and [[Karelians]]. In today's usage, the term \"Nordic peoples\" refers to the ethnic groups in all of the [[Nordic countries]]. In Great Britain, Germanic people coalesced into the [[Anglo-Saxon]] (or [[English people|English]]) people between the 8th and 10th centuries.\n\nThe various Germanic peoples of the Migrations period eventually spread out over a vast expanse stretching from contemporary [[European Russia]] to [[Iceland]] and from [[Norway]] to [[North Africa]]. The migrants had varying impacts in different regions. In many cases, the newcomers set themselves up as overlords of the pre-existing population. Over time, such groups underwent [[ethnogenesis]], resulting in the creation of new cultural and ethnic identities (e.g., the [[Franks]] and [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]]s becoming the [[French people|French]]). Thus, many of the descendants of the ancient Germanic peoples do not speak Germanic languages, as they were to a greater or lesser degree assimilated into the cosmopolitan, literate culture of the Roman world.{{sfn|Ostler|2006|pp=306\u2013307}} Even where the descendants of Germanic peoples maintained greater continuity with their common ancestors, significant cultural and linguistic differences arose over time, as is strikingly illustrated by the different identities of Christianized Saxon subjects of the Carolingian Empire and pagan Scandinavian Vikings.\n\nMore broadly, early Medieval Germanic peoples were often [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilate]]d into the ''[[walha]]'' substrate cultures of their subject populations. Thus, the [[Burgundians]] of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], the [[Vandals]] of Northern Africa, and the [[Visigoths]] of France and Iberia, lost some Germanic identity and became part of [[Romano-Germanic Europe]]. For the Germanic Visigoths in particular, they had intimate contact with Rome for two centuries before their domination of the Iberian Peninsula and were accordingly permeated by Roman culture.{{sfn|Men\u00e9ndez-Pidal|1968|p=19}} Likewise, the [[Franks]] of [[Western Francia]] form part of the ancestry of the [[French people]].\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] resulted in Anglo-Saxon (or English) displacement and cultural assimilation of the indigenous culture, the [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]]-speaking British culture, causing the foundation of a new kingdom, England. As in what became England, indigenous Brythonic Celtic culture in some of the south-eastern parts of what became [[Scotland]] (approximately the [[Lothian and Borders]] region) and areas of what became the Northwest of England (the kingdoms of [[Rheged]], [[Elmet]], etc.) succumbed to Germanic influence c.600\u2014800, due to the extension of overlordship and settlement from the Anglo-Saxon areas to the south. Cultural and linguistic assimilation occurred less frequently between the Germanic Anglo-Saxons and the indigenous people who resided in the Roman dominated areas of England, particularly in the regions that remained previously unconquered. Anglo-Saxons occupied Somerset, the Severn valley, and Lancaster by c. 700 where they remained dominant. Over time, the Anglo-Saxons, with their distinct culture and language, displaced much of the extant Roman influence of old.{{sfn|Wickham|2009|pp=150\u2013155}}\n[[File:Boerfamily1886.jpg|thumb|[[Afrikaner]]s are descended from 17th century Dutch immigrants to [[South Africa]].]]\n\nOn the European continent, the [[East Francia|eastern remnant]] of Francia developed into the [[Kingdom of Germany]], which became the most important part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] proclaimed by [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] in 962 AD.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=311-312}} The Holy Roman Empire included all remaining Germanic-speaking groups from the 10th century.

Between the 8th and 11th centuries, these [[Scandinavia]]n/Norse traders and pirates ravaged most of north and central Europe as well as the British Isles, spreading eastwards as far as Russia and into Byzantium.

Germanic monarchy was [[elective monarchy|elective]]; the king was elected by the free men from among eligible candidates of a family ([[Old English|OE]] ''cynn'') tracing their ancestry to the tribe's divine or semi-divine founder.\n\nTo a large degree, many of the extant legal records from the Germanic tribes seem to revolve around property transactions.{{sfn|Oliver|2011|p=27}} In early Germanic society, the free men of property each ruled their own [[Estate (house)|estate]] and were subject to the king directly, without any intermediate hierarchy as in later [[feudalism]]. Free men without landed property could [[oath|swear fealty]] to a man of property who as their lord would then be responsible for their upkeep, including generous [[symbel|feasts]] and gifts. This system of sworn retainers was central to early Germanic society, and the loyalty of the retainer to his lord generally replaced his family ties.\n\n[[Early Germanic law]] reflects a hierarchy of worth within the society of free men, reflected in the differences in [[weregild]]. Among the Anglo-Saxons, a regular free man (a ''[[Churl|ceorl]]'') had a weregild of 200 [[shilling]]s (i.e. [[solidus (coin)|solidi]] or gold pieces), classified as a ''twyhyndeman'' \"200-man\" for this reason, while a nobleman commanded a fee of six times that amount (''twelfhyndeman'' \"1200-man\"). Similarly, among the [[Alamanni]] the basic weregild for a free man was 200 shillings, and the amount could be doubled or tripled according to the man's rank. Unfree serfs did not command a weregild, and the recompense paid in the event of their death was merely for material damage, 15 shillings in the case of the Alamanni, increased to 40 or 50 if the victim had been a skilled artisan.\n\nThe social hierarchy is not only reflected in the weregild due in the case of the violent or accidental death of a man, but also in differences in fines for lesser crimes. Thus the fines for insults, injury, burglary or damage to property differ depending on the rank of the injured party.{{Efn|E.g. \"If a freeman steal from the king, let him pay ninefold\", in the [[Law of \u00c6thelberht]], paragraph 4.}} They do not usually depend on the rank of the guilty party, although there are some exceptions associated with royal privilege.{{Efn|E.g. reduction of the weregild to half the regular amount if the man responsible for the killing is employed by the king in the laws of \u00c6thelberht of Kent, paragraph 7.}}\n\nFree women did not have a political station of their own but inherited the rank of their father if unmarried, or their husband if married. The weregild or recompense due for the killing or injuring of a woman is notably set at twice that of a man of the same rank in [[Lex Alamannorum|Alemannic law]].\n\nAll freemen had the right to participate in general assemblies or ''[[thing (assembly)|things]]'', where disputes between freemen were addressed according to customary law. The king was bound to uphold ancestral law, but was at the same time the source for new laws for cases not addressed in previous tradition. This aspect was the reason for the creation of the various Germanic law codes by the kings following their [[Christianization of the Germanic peoples|conversion to Christianity]]: besides recording inherited tribal law, these codes have the purpose of settling the position of the [[Christian Church|church]] and Christian [[clergy]] within society, usually setting the weregilds of the members of the clerical hierarchy parallel to that of the existing hierarchy of nobility, with the position of an [[archbishop]] mirroring that of the king.\n\nIn the case of a suspected crime, the accused could avoid punishment by presenting a fixed number of free men (their number depending on the severity of the crime) prepared to swear an [[oath]] on his innocence. Failing this, he could prove his innocence in a [[trial by combat]]. Corporal or capital punishment for free men does not figure in the Germanic law codes, and [[banishment]] appears to be the most severe penalty issued officially. This reflects that Germanic tribal law did not have the scope of exacting [[blood feud|revenge]], which was left to the judgement of the family of the victim, but to settle damages as fairly as possible once an involved party decided to bring a dispute before the assembly. A fascinating component of early Germanic laws were the varying distinctions concerning the physical body, as each body part had a personal injury value and corresponding legal claims for personal injury viewed matters like gender, rank and status as a secondary interest when deliberating cases.{{sfn|Oliver|2011|pp=203\u2013226}}\n\nGenerally speaking, Roman legal codes eventually provided the model for many Germanic laws and they were fixed in writing along with Germanic legal customs.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=310}} Traditional Germanic society was gradually replaced by the system of [[estates of the realm|estates]] and [[feudalism]] characteristic of the [[High Middle Ages]] in both the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[Anglo-Norman England|Anglo-Norman]] England in the 11th to 12th centuries, to some extent under the influence of [[Roman law]] as an indirect result of Christianisation, but also because political structures had grown too large for the flat hierarchy of a [[tribal society]]. The same effect of political centralization took hold in Scandinavia slightly later, in the 12th to 13th century ([[Age of the Sturlungs]], [[Consolidation of Sweden]], [[Civil war era in Norway]]), by the end of the 14th century culminating in the giant [[Kalmar Union]]. Elements of tribal law, notably the [[Trial by combat|wager of battle]], nevertheless remained in effect throughout the Middle Ages, in the case of the Holy Roman Empire until the establishment of the [[Imperial Chamber Court]] in the early [[German Renaissance]]. In the [[federalism|federalist]] organization of [[Switzerland]], where [[cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] structures remained comparatively local, the Germanic thing survived into the 21st century in the form of the ''[[Landsgemeinde]]'', albeit subject to federal law.\n\n===Warfare===\n{{Further|Germanic Wars|Gothic warfare|Anglo-Saxon warfare|Migration period spear}}\n[[File:Osterby Man.jpg|thumb|left|[[Osterby Man|Osterby Head]], a [[bog body]] with a [[Suebian knot]]]]\nHistorical records of the Germanic tribes in [[Germania]] east of the [[Rhine]] and west of the [[Danube]] do not begin until quite late in the ancient period, so only the period after 100 BCE can be examined. What is clear is that the Germanic idea of warfare was quite different from the pitched battles fought by [[Rome]] and [[Greece]]. Instead the Germanic tribes focused on raids. Warfare of varying size however was a distinctive feature of barbarian culture.{{sfn|Geary|1999|p=113}}\n\nThe purpose of these was generally not to gain territory, but rather to capture resources and secure prestige. These raids were conducted by [[irregular military|irregular troops]], often formed along family or village lines, in groups of 10 to about 1,000. Leaders of unusual personal magnetism could gather more soldiers for longer periods, but there was no systematic method of gathering and training men, so the death of a charismatic leader could mean the destruction of an army. Armies also often consisted of more than 50 percent noncombatants, as displaced people would travel with large groups of soldiers, the elderly, women, and children. War leaders who were able to secure ample booty for their retainers were able to grow accordingly by attracting warrior bands from nearby villages.{{sfn|Geary|1999|p=113}}\n\nLarge bodies of troops, while figuring prominently in the history books, were the exception rather than the rule of ancient warfare. Thus a typical Germanic force might consist of 100 men with the sole goal of raiding a nearby Germanic or foreign village. Thus, most warfare was at their barbarian neighbors.{{sfn|Geary|1999|p=113}} According to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources, when the [[Germanic Tribes]] did fight pitched battles, the infantry often adopted wedge formations, each wedge being led by a clan head. Legitimacy for leaders among the Germans resided in their ability to successfully lead armies to victory. Defeat on the battlefield at the hands of the Romans or other barbarians often meant the end of a ruler and in some cases, being absorbed by \"another, victorious confederation.\"{{sfn|Geary|1999|p=112}}\n\nThough often defeated by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], the Germanic tribes were remembered in Roman records as fierce combatants, whose main downfall was that they failed to join together into a collective fighting force under a unified [[Command (military formation)|command]], which allowed the Roman Empire to employ a \"divide and conquer\" strategy against them.{{sfn|Archer|Ferris|Herwig|Travers|2008|p=105}} On occasions when the Germanic tribes worked together, the results were impressive. Three [[Roman legion]]s were ambushed and destroyed by an alliance of Germanic tribes headed by [[Arminius]] at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in 9 CE, the Roman Empire made no further concentrated attempts at conquering Germania beyond the Rhine.{{sfn|Roberts|1996|pp=65\u201366}}\n\nDuring the 4th and 5th centuries CE, Visigoths and Vandals militarily organized themselves to sufficiently challenge and sack Rome in CE 410 and again in CE 455. Then in CE 476, the last Roman emperor was deposed by a German chieftain, an event which effectively ended Roman predominance in western Europe.{{sfn|Daniels|Hyslop|2014|p=85}} Germanic tribes eventually overwhelmed and conquered the ancient world. That military transition was additionally spurred by the arrival of the Vikings from the 8th to 10th centuries, giving rise to modern Europe and medieval warfare.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=836}}\n\nFor an analysis of Germanic tactics versus the Roman empire see: [[Roman infantry tactics#Roman infantry versus Gallic and the Germanic tribes|Roman infantry versus Gallic and the Germanic tribes]]\n\n====Weaponry====\nWeapons used by the Germanic tribes varied. Some of them used axes, throwing javelins, spears, bows and arrows along with swords. Most of the swords used by the Germanic warriors were those captured from Roman soldiers until the 4th century when German blacksmiths began making the best steel in Europe.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=321}} Body armor was rarely worn and when it was, it was light by comparison to what the Romans employed; only war leaders wore helmets on the battlefield.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=321\u2013322}} Commandeering of Roman weaponry was widespread and the acquisition of the superior Roman armaments allowed the Germanic leaders to exert their power in ways not previously available. It also meant fierce inter-Germanic rivalry which constituted the larger power blocks of the Germanic world.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=458\u2013459}} Much like their predecessors, the Vikings too used axes, swords, long knives, spears, oblong shields, leather or metal helmets and mail or leather coats for protection; the latter being luxuries most could not afford.{{sfn|Santosuo|2004|pp=143\u2013144}}\n\n====Tactics====\nTo the greatest extent, Germanic fighting units consisted of infantry who would emerge from cover and attack, but they also utilized skilled cavalrymen at times, something the Visigoths used decisively to aid in their victory at Adrianople. Cavalry warfare was limited in northern Europe due to the lack of suitably large horses for mounted troops. Caesar provided his Germanic armies with Roman mounts to enable them greater mobility and to enhance their fighting efficiency.{{sfn|Todd|1999|pp=36\u201337}} Unlike their western Celtic neighbors, the use of chariots was not picked up by the early Germans.{{sfn|Todd |1999|p=37}} Notwithstanding the use of an occasional fortified position, the Germanic warriors preferred to fight in the open and normally assumed the offensive rather than fight defensively.{{sfn|B\u00e9mont|Monod|2012|pp=485\u2013486}} Emboldening themselves for fierce attacks, the Germanic warriors would rouse themselves to a high-pitched level of excitement and charge headlong against their enemies, which while effective for ambush operations, lacked in terms of the organizational skill needed for prolonged siege warfare.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=322}} The berserker mentality employed by the Germanic tribes against Rome was still in effect during the Viking era of the 8th and 9th centuries as they too believed that by summoning their gods and working themselves up, they would possess superhuman strength and be protected during battle. Such resolution led them to believe that dying in such a manner was heroic and would transport the fallen fighter straight into [[Valhalla]] where they would be embraced by the warrior maidens known as the Valkyries.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=322}}{{Efn|Warriors were physically adept and owed much of their ''[[esprit de corps]]'' to the loyalty existing between themselves and their tribal chieftains. After forming a shield wall, they would then hurl a single spear in unison as a sacrifice to Odin. Fighting thereafter normally devolved to a gang raid and individual combat. See: Waldman & Mason 2006, p. 837.}} The later military development of armored knights and fortified castles was a response in part to the relentless plundering and raiding by the Vikings, which meant that the Germanic tribes who had settled mainland Europe and the British Isles had to adapt themselves so as to combat another Germanic tribe of interlopers.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=322\u2013323}}\n\n===Economy===\nTraces of the earliest pastoralism of the Germanic peoples appear in central Europe in the form of elaborate cattle burials along the Elbe and Vistula Rivers from around 4000\u20133000 BCE.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=312}} These archaeological remnants were left by the [[Globular Amphora culture]] who cleared forests for herding cattle and sometime after 3000 BCE began using wheeled carts and plows to cultivate their lands. Central to survival for their assistance in tilling the soil and supplying food, cattle became an economic resource to these early people.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=313}} Germanic settlements were typically small, rarely containing much more than ten households, often less, and were usually located by clearings in the woods.{{Efn|This and the following information is based on P.J. Geary, ''Before France and Germany. The Creation and Transformation of the Merovingian World'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), 44 ff. and M. Innes, ''Introduction to Early Medieval Western Europe, 300\u2013900'' (Abingdon 2007), 71\u201372.}} Settlements remained of a fairly constant size throughout the period. The buildings in these villages varied in form, but normally consisted of farmhouses surrounded by smaller buildings such as granaries and other storage rooms. The universal building material was timber. Cattle and humans usually lived together in the same house.\n\nAlthough the Germans practiced both agriculture and [[husbandry]], the latter was extremely important both as a source of dairy products and as a basis for wealth and social status, which was measured by the size of an individual's herd.{{sfn|Kishlansky|Geary|O'Brien|2008|p=164}} The diet consisted mainly of the products of farming and husbandry and was supplied by hunting to a very modest extent. Barley and wheat were the most common agricultural products and were used for baking a certain flat type of bread as well as brewing beer. Evidence from a Saxon village known as [[Feddersen Wierde]] near Cuxhaven, Germany (which existed between BCE 50 to CE 450) shows that the Germanic people cultivated oats and rye, used manure as fertilizer, and that they practiced crop-rotation.{{sfn|Osborne|2008|p=39}}\n\nThe fields were tilled with a light-weight wooden [[ard (plough)|ard]], although heavier models also existed in some areas. Common clothing styles are known from the remarkably well-preserved [[bog bodies|corpses]] that have been found in former marshes on several locations in Denmark, and included woolen garments and brooches for women and trousers and leather caps for men. Other important small-scale industries were weaving, the manual production of basic pottery and, more rarely, the fabrication of iron tools, especially weapons.{{sfn|''The Imperial Teutonic Order''}} The [[Corded Ware culture]] and the [[Funnelbeaker culture]] (circa. 2900\u20132300 BCE) of these north and central European peoples coincide one another and provide evidence of how they lived, traded and buried their dead.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=313\u2013314}}\n\nAfter 1300 BCE the societies of Jutland and Northern Germany along with the Celtic people experienced a major revolution in technology during the Late Bronze Age, shaping tools, containers and weapons through the improved techniques of working bronze. Both the sword and the bow and arrow as well as other weaponry proliferate and an arms race of sorts between the tribes ensued as they tried to outpace one another. Trade was taking place to a greater degree and simple gems and amber from the Mediterranean indicate that long-distance exchange of goods was occurring.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=314\u2013315}} When the Iron Age (1500\u20141200 BCE) arrived, the Germanic people showed greater mastery of ironworks than their Celtic contemporaries but they did not have the extensive trade networks during this period that their southern neighbors enjoyed with the Greco-Roman world.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=315}}\n\nWidening trade between the Germanic tribes and Rome started later following the Empire's wars of conquest when they looked to the Germanic people to supply them with slaves, leather and quality iron. One of the reasons the Romans may have drawn borders along the Rhine, besides the sizable population of Germanic warriors on one side of it, was that the Germanic economy was not robust enough for them to extract much booty nor were they convinced they could acquire sufficient tax revenue from any additional efforts of conquest. Drawing a distinctive line between themselves and Germanic people also incentivized alliances and trade as the Germanic people sought a share of the imperial wealth.{{sfn|Manco|2013|p=202}} Roman coinage was coveted by the Germanic people who preferred silver to gold coins, mostly likely indications that a market economy was developing. Tacitus does mention the presence of a bartering system being observable among the Germanic people, but this was not exclusive, as he also writes of their use of \"gold and silver for the purpose of commerce\", adding rather sardonically in his text, that what they exchanged was nothing more than \"petty merchandise.{{sfn|Tacitus|2009|p=48}} Such observations from Tacitus aside, fine metalwork, iron and glassware was soon being traded by the Germanic peoples along the coast of the [[North Sea]] of [[Denmark]] and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=315\u2013316}}\n\n===Kinship patterns===\nThe writings of Tacitus allude to the Germanic peoples being aware of a shared ethnicity, in that, they either knew or believed that they shared a common biological ancestor with one another. Just how pervasive this awareness may have been is certainly debatable, but other factors like language, clothing, ornamentation, hair styles, weapon types, religious practices and shared oral history were likely just as significant in tribal identity for the Germanics.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=318}} Members of a Germanic tribe told tales about the exploits of heroic founding figures who were more or less mythologized. Village life consisted of free men assembled under a chieftain, all of whom shared common cultural and political traditions. Status among the early Germanic tribes was often gauged by the size of a man's cattle herd or by one's martial prowess.{{sfn|Geary|1999|p=111}}\n\nBefore their [[conversion (religious)|conversion]] to [[Christianity]], the Germanic peoples of Europe were made up of several [[tribe]]s, each functioning as an economic and military unit and sometimes united by a common religious cult. [[Kinship]], especially close kinship, was very important to life within a tribe but generally was not the source of a tribe's identity. In fact, several elements of ancient Germanic life tended to weaken the role of kinship: the importance of the [[retinue]]s surrounding military [[chieftain]]s, the ability of strong leaders to unite people who were not closely related, and [[feud]]s and other conflicts within a tribe that might lead to permanent divisions. The retinue (often called \"comitatus\" by scholars, following the practice of ancient Roman writers) consisted of the followers of a chieftain, who depended on the retinue for [[military]] and other services and who in return provided for the retinue's needs and divided with them the spoils of battle.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/topic/comitatus Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, ''Comitatus'']</ref> This relationship between a chieftain and his followers became the basis for the more complicated [[feudal system]] that developed in [[medieval Europe]]. A chieftain's retinue might include close relatives, but it was not limited to them. Eventually the rising power of individual chieftains and kings from among the military leadership of Germanic tribes and confederations curtailed and in many ways replaced the power once enjoyed by tribal assemblies.{{sfn|Todd |1999|pp=31\u201332}} A code of ethics in battle prevailed among the Germanic kin. According to Tacitus, the \"greatest disgrace that can befall\" a warrior of a clan among the Germanic tribes was the abandonment of their shield during combat, as this almost certainly resulted in social isolation.{{sfn|Tacitus|2009|p=49}} Within tribal Germanic society, their social hierarchy was linked intrinsically to war and this warrior code maintained the fidelity between chiefs and their young warriors.{{sfn|Heather|2003|p=324}}\n\nFeuds were the standard means for resolving conflicts and regulating behavior. Peace within the tribe was about controlling violence with codes identifying exactly how certain types of feuds were to be settled.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=318}} Those closely related to a person who had been injured or killed were supposed to exact revenge on or monetary payment from the offender. This duty helped reaffirm the bonds between extended family members. Yet such feuds weakened the tribe as a whole, sometimes leading to the creation of a new tribe as one group separated from the rest. Clans of Germanic people consisted of groupings of about 50 households in total with societal rules for each specific clan.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=317}} Recent scholarship suggests that, despite the obligation to take part in feuds and other customs involving kinship ties, [[extended families]] did not form independent units among the early Germanic peoples. Though most members of a tribe would have been more or less distantly related, common descent was not the main source of a tribe's identity, and extended families were not the main social units within a tribe. Traditional theories have emphasized the supposedly central role in Germanic culture of clans or large groups with common ancestry. But there is little evidence that such clans existed, and they were certainly not an important element of social organization. As historian Alexander C. Murray concludes, \"kinship was a crucial factor in all aspects of barbarian activity, but its uses and groupings were fluid, and probably on the whole not long lasting.\"{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=64}} Internal competition within the factions of a tribe occasionally resulted in internecine warfare which weakened and sometime destroyed a group, as appears to have been the case for the Cherusci tribe during Rome's earlier period.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe most important family relationships among the early Germanic peoples were within the individual household, a fact based on the archaeological evidence from their settlements where the long-houses appeared to be central in their existence. Within the household unit, an individual was equally bound to both the mother and the father's side of the family.{{sfn|Todd |1999|p=32}} Fathers were the main figures of authority,{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=317}} but wives also played an important and respected role. Some Germanic tribes even believed that women possessed magical powers and were feared accordingly.{{sfn|Williams|1998|p=79}} [[Tacitus]] describes how, during battles, Germanic warriors were encouraged and cared for by their wives and mothers. He also notes that during times of peace, women did most of the work of managing the household. Along with the children, they apparently did most of the household chores as well. Children were valued, and according to Tacitus, limiting or destroying one's offspring was considered shameful. Mothers apparently breast-fed their own children rather than using nurses. Besides parents and children, a household might include slaves, but slavery was uncommon, and according to Tacitus, slaves normally had households of their own. Their slaves (usually prisoners of war) were most often employed as domestic servants.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=317}} Polygamy and concubinage were rare but existed, at least among the upper classes.{{Efn|See: Young, Bruce W. (2008). ''Family Life in the Age of Shakespeare''. Greenwood Press, pp. 16\u201317.}} When a certain number of families resided on the same territory, this constituted a village (''Dorf'' in German). The overall territory occupied by people from the same tribe was designated in the writings of Tacitus as a ''civitas'', with each of the individual ''civitas'' divided into ''pagi'' (or cantons), which were made up of several ''vici''. In cases where the tribes were grouped into larger confederations or a group of kingdoms, the term ''pagus'' was applied (''Gau'' in German).{{sfn|B\u00e9mont|Monod|2012|pp=410\u2013415}} Extensive contact with Rome altered the egalitarian structure of tribal Germanic society. As individuals rose to prominence, a distinction between commoner and nobility developed and with it the previous constructs of folkright shared equally across the tribe was replaced in some cases by privilege.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=321}} As a result, Germanic society became more stratified. Elites within the Germanic tribes who learned the Roman system and emulated the way they established dominion were able to gain advantages and exploit them accordingly.{{sfn|Pohl|1997|p=34}}\n\nImportant changes began taking place by the 4th century CE as Germanic peoples, while still cognizant of their unique clan identities, started forming larger confederations of a similar culture. Gathering around the dominant tribes among them and hearkening to the most charismatic leaders brought the various barbarians tribes closer together. On the surface this change appeared to the Romans as welcome since they preferred to deal with a few strong chiefs to control the populations that they feared across the Rhine and Danube, but it eventually made these Germanic rulers of confederated peoples more and more powerful.{{sfn|Santosuo|2004|p=9}} While strong, they were still not federated to one another since they possessed no sense of \"pan-Germanic solidarity\", but this started to change noticeably by the 5th century CE at Rome's expense.{{sfn|Ward-Perkins|2005|pp=50\u201351}}\n\n===Marriage===\nBased on the writings of Tacitus, most of the barbarians were content with one wife which indicates a general trend towards monogamy. For those higher within their social hierarchy however, polygamy was sometimes \"solicited on account of their rank\".{{sfn|Tacitus|2009|p=52}} Of note, Tacitus observed that \"the wife does not bring a dowry to her husband, but receives one from him\" and wedding gifts related to a marriage consisted of things like oxen, saddles and various armaments. Revealing the warlike nature of their society, Tacitus also reported that wives came to their husbands \"as a partner in toils and dangers; to suffer and to dare equally with him, in peace and in war.{{sfn|Tacitus|2009|p=52}}\n\nThe [[Marriageable age|age at first marriage]] among ancient Germanic tribes, according to [[Tacitus]], was late for women compared to Roman women:\n<blockquote>The youths partake late of the pleasures of love, and hence pass the age of puberty unexhausted: nor are the virgins hurried into marriage; the same maturity, the same full growth is required: the sexes unite equally matched and robust; and the children inherit the vigor of their parents.{{sfn|Tacitus|2009|p=53}}</blockquote>\nFor Germanic women of later antiquity, marriage obviously had its appeal since it offered greater security and better placement in their social hierarchy.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=261}} Where [[Aristotle]] had set the prime of life at 37 years for men and 18 for women, the [[Visigothic Code|Visigothic Code of law]] in the 7th century placed the prime of life at twenty years for both men and women, after which both presumably married. Thus it can be presumed that ancient Germanic brides were on average about twenty and were roughly the same age as their husbands.{{sfn|Herlihy|1985|pp=73\u201375}}\nTacitus, however, had never visited the German-speaking lands and most of his information on [[Germania]] comes from secondary sources. In addition, Anglo-Saxon women, like those of other Germanic tribes, are marked as women from the age of twelve onward, based on archaeological finds, implying that the age of marriage coincided with [[puberty]].{{sfn|Green|Siegmund|2003|p=107}} Generally, there were two forms of marriage among the Germanic peoples, one involving the participation of the parents and the other, those that did not. Known as ''Friedelehe'', the latter form consisted of marriage between a free man and a free woman, since marriage between free persons and slaves was forbidden by law.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=262}} Evidence of Germanic patriarchy is evident later in the 7th century CE [[Edict of Rothari]] of the Lombards which stated that women were not allowed to live of their own freewill and that they had to be subject to a man and if no one else, they were to be \"under the power of the king\".{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=281}}\n\nFor Germanic kings, warrior chieftains, senators and Roman nobility, a certain degree of intermarriage was undertaken to strengthen their ties to one another and to the Empire, making marriage or ''connubium'' as the Romans connoted the bond, an instrument of politics.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=105}} Earlier treaty terms in the late 4th century CE had forbidden \"foreign\" Goths to intermarry with Romans.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=88}}  Some of the marriage attempts of the 6th century CE were deliberately planned  for the sake of royal succession. Imperial policy had to be carefully charted between the Roman-Germanic claimants to kingship and the maintenance of Roman imperial administration as the federated Germanic kings attempted to put their stamp on Roman rule and replace Roman armies with their own warriors. Roman leaders were not oblivious to the clever tactics (intermarriage and offspring) employed by Germanic chieftains and adopted creative treaties to either appease them or temper their ambitions.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=106\u2013107}}\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Germanic paganism|Continental Germanic mythology|Germanic Christianity}}\n[[File:Praying Germanic man 1890.jpg|left|thumb|Roman bronze figurine depicting praying German with a [[Suebian knot]].]]\n\nPrior to the Middle Ages, Germanic peoples followed what is now referred to as [[Germanic paganism]]: \"a system of interlocking and closely interrelated religious worldviews and practices rather than as one indivisible religion\" and as such consisted of \"individual worshippers, family traditions and regional cults within a broadly consistent framework\".{{sfn|Ewing|2008|p=9}} It was [[polytheism|polytheistic]] in nature, with some underlying similarities to other [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-Germanic traditions]]. Despite the unique practices of some tribes, there was a degree of cultural uniformity among the Germanic people concerning religion.{{sfn|Eliade|1984|p=154}}{{Efn|Many groups of Germanic peoples shared one form or another of a creation story where a divine being emerges from nothingness only to be sacrificed and torn to pieces; the bones of this divine creature (named Ymir) produced the rocks, his flesh became the earth, his blood formed the seas, the clouds emerged from his hair, and his skull made up the sky.{{sfn|Eliade|1984|pp=155\u2013156}} In this creation story, a mighty tree called ''Yggdrasill'' is situated at the center of the earth, its top touching the sky, its branches covering the earth, and the great tree's roots plunging into hell. Connecting the three planes of \"Heaven, Earth, and Hades\", this \"Universal Tree\" symbolized the universe itself.{{sfn|Eliade|1984|p=157}} }} Germanic ideology and religious practices were pervaded and colored to a large degree by war, particularly the notion of a heroic death on the battlefield, as this brought the god(s) a \"blood sacrifice.\"{{sfn|Eliade|1984|p=161}} {{Efn|The principle shared deity among the Germanic tribes, Odin-Wodan, (in varying name forms) was not only the god of war, but of the dead as well. Odin-Wodan protected great heroes in combat but often killed his \"prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\", who were led to him by the Valkyries and gathered together to practice fighting in preparation for the final eschatological battle of the ''Ragnar\u00f6k''.{{sfn|Eliade|1984|p=161}}}}\n\nArchaeological findings suggest that the Germanic barbarians practiced some of the same 'spiritual' rituals as the Celts, including human sacrifice, divination, and the belief in spiritual connection with the natural environment around them.{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=367}} Germanic priestesses were feared by the Romans, as these tall women with glaring eyes, wearing flowing white gowns often wielded a knife for sacrificial offerings. Captives might have their throats cut and be bled into giant cauldrons or have their intestines opened up and the entrails thrown to the ground for prophetic readings.{{sfn|Williams|1998|pp=81\u201382}} Spiritual rituals frequently occurred in consecrated groves or upon islands on lakes where perpetual fires burned.{{sfn|Williams|1998|p=82}}\n\nMany of the [[List of Germanic deities|deities found in Germanic paganism]] appeared under similar names across the Germanic peoples, most notably the god known to the Germans as [[Wodan]] or [[W\u014dden|Wotan]], to the Anglo-Saxons as [[Woden]], and to the Norse as [[Odin|\u00d3\u00f0inn]], as well as the god [[Thor]] \u2013 known to the Germans as [[Donar]], to the Anglo-Saxons as \u00deunor and to the Norse as \u00de\u00f3rr.  Pagan beliefs amid the Germanic tribes were reported by some of the earlier Roman historians and in the 6th century CE another instance of this appears when the Byzantine historian and poet, Agathias, remarked that the Alamannic religion was \"solidly and unsophisticatedly pagan.\"{{sfn|Drinkwater|2007|p=117}} Christianity had no relevance for the pagan barbarians until their contact and integration with Rome.{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=368}}\n\nWhile the Germanic peoples were slowly converted to Christianity by varying means, many elements of the pre-Christian culture and indigenous beliefs remained firmly in place after the conversion process, particularly in the more rural and distant regions. Of particular note is the survival of the pagan fascination with the forest in the retention of Christmas tree even today. Many of the Germanic tribes actually revered forests as sacred places and left them unmolested. Conversion to Christianity broke this pagan obsession with protecting the forest in some locations and allowed once migrant tribes to settle in places where they previously refused to cultivate the soil or chop down trees based on religious belief. To that end, the Christianisation of Germanic peoples facilitated the clearing of forests and therewith provided \"a broad and stable basis for the medieval economy of Central Europe\" by leveraging the vast forest resources available to them.{{sfn|Price|1965|pp=368\u2013378}} The [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]], and [[Vandals]] were [[Christianized]] while they were still outside the bounds of the Empire; however, they converted to [[Arianism]] rather than orthodox [[Catholicism]], and were soon regarded as [[Christian heresy|heretics]].{{sfn|Santosuo|2004|pp=14\u201316}} The one great written remnant of the [[Gothic language]] is a translation of portions of the [[Bible]] made by [[Ulfilas]], the [[missionary]] who converted them.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=327}} Goths, Vandals, and other Germanic peoples often offered political resistance prior to their conversion to Christianity.{{sfn|Cameron|1997|p=97}} The [[Lombards]] were not converted until after their entrance into the Empire, but received Christianity from [[Arianism|Arian]] Germanic groups sometime during the 5th century.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=497}}\n\nPaganism and Christianity were still being practiced across the empire when Constantine died in CE 337, despite his conversion; he did however ban pagan rituals at select religious temples.{{sfn|Cameron|1997|p=98}} Sometime between CE 391\u2013392, the barbarian king Theodosius I made an official proclamation which outlawed pagan religions in his region of influence with various successors like Justinian doing likewise.{{sfn|Cameron|1997|p=98}} The [[Franks]] were converted directly from [[paganism]] to [[Catholicism]] under the leadership of Clovis in about CE 496 without an intervening time as [[Arianism|Arians]].{{sfn|Germanic peoples, ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online''}} Eventually the Gothic tribes turned away from their Arian faith and in CE 589 converted to Catholicism.{{sfn|Pohl |1997|p=37}} Several centuries later, [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] and Frankish missionaries and warriors undertook the conversion of their [[Saxon people|Saxon]] neighbors. A key event was the felling of [[Thor's Oak]] near [[Fritzlar]] by [[Boniface]], apostle of the Germans, in CE 723. When Thor failed to strike Boniface dead after the oak hit the ground, the Franks were amazed and began their conversion to the Christian faith.{{Efn| See: Levison (1905). ''Vitae Sancti Bonifatii archiepiscopi moguntini'', pp. 31\u201332.}}\n\nEventually for many Germanic tribes, the conversion to Christianity was achieved by armed force, successfully completed by [[Charlemagne]], in a series of campaigns (the [[Saxon Wars]]), that also brought Saxon lands into the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish empire]].{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|pp=103\u2013106}} Massacres, such as the [[Bloody Verdict of Verden]], where as many as 4,500 people were beheaded according to one of Charlemagne's chroniclers, were a direct result of this policy.{{sfn|Wilson|2005|p=47}}\n\nIn [[Scandinavia]], Germanic paganism continued to dominate until the 11th century in the form of [[Norse paganism]], when it was gradually replaced by Christianity.{{sfn|Kendrick|2013|pp=118\u2013123}}\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Percentage of major Y-DNA haplogroups in Europe.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Percentage of major [[Y-DNA]] haplogroups in Europe.

The five confluences, known as the [[Panch Prayag]], are all along the Alaknanda. They are, in downstream order, [[Vishnuprayag]], where the Dhauliganga joins the Alaknanda; [[Nandprayag]], where the Nandakini joins; [[Karnaprayag]], where the Pindar joins, [[Rudraprayag]], where the Mandakini joins; and finally, [[Devprayag]], where the Bhagirathi joins the Alaknanda to form the Ganges River proper.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nAfter flowing 250&nbsp;km (155.343&nbsp;mi) {{sfn|Krishna Murti|1991|p=19}} through its narrow Himalayan valley, the Ganges emerges from the mountains at [[Rishikesh]], then [[debouch]]es onto the [[Gangetic Plain]] at the pilgrimage town of [[Haridwar]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> At Haridwar, a dam diverts some of its waters into the [[Ganges Canal]], which irrigates the ''[[Doab]]'' region of [[Uttar Pradesh]], whereas the river, whose course has been roughly southwest until this point, now begins to flow southeast through the plains of northern India.\n\nThe Ganges follows an {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} arching course passing through the cities of [[Kannauj]], [[Farukhabad]], and [[Kanpur]]. Along the way it is joined by the [[Ramganga]], which contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|500|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}} The Ganges joins the [[Yamuna]] at the [[Triveni Sangam]] at [[Allahabad]], a holy confluence in Hinduism. At their confluence the Yamuna is larger than the Ganges, contributing about {{convert|2950|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}} or about 58.5% of the combined flow.{{sfn|Gupta|2007|page=347}}\n\nNow flowing east, the river meets the [[Tamsa River]] (also called ''Tons''), which flows north from the [[Kaimur Range]] and contributes an average flow of about {{convert|190|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. After the Tamsa the [[Gomti River]] joins, flowing south from the Himalayas. The Gomti contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|234|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. Then the [[Ghaghara River]] (Karnali River), also flowing south from the Himalayas of Nepal, joins. The Ghaghara (Karnali), with its average annual flow of about {{convert|2990|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, is the largest tributary of the Ganges. After the Ghaghara (Karnali) confluence the Ganges is joined from the south by the [[Son River]], contributing about {{convert|1000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. The [[Gandaki River]], then the [[Kosi River]], join from the north flowing from Nepal, contributing about {{convert|1654|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2166|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, respectively. The Kosi is the third largest tributary of the Ganges, after the Ghaghara (Karnali) and Yamuna.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}}The Kosi merges into the Ganges near Kursela in Bihar.\n\nAlong the way between [[Allahabad]] and [[Malda, Bihar|Malda]], West Bengal, the Ganges passes the towns of [[Chunar]], [[Mirzapur]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Patna]], [[Hajipur]], [[Chhapra|Chapra]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Ballia]], [[Buxar]], [[Simaria]], [[Sultanganj]], and [[Saidpur, Ghazipur|Saidpur]]. At Bhagalpur, the river begins to flow south-southeast and at [[Pakur]], it begins its attrition with the branching away of its first [[distributary]], the [[Hooghly River|Bh\u0101girathi-Hooghly]], which goes on to become the [[Hooghly River]]. Just before the border with [[Bangladesh]] the [[Farakka Barrage]] controls the flow of the Ganges, diverting some of the water into a feeder canal linked to the Hooghly for the purpose of keeping it relatively silt-free. The Hooghly River is formed by the confluence of the Bhagirathi River and [[Jalangi River]] at [[Nabadwip]], and Hooghly has a number of tributaries of its own. The largest is the [[Damodar River]], which is {{convert|541|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with a drainage basin of {{convert|25820|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Dhungel|Pun|2009|p=215}} The Hooghly River empties into the Bay of Bengal near [[Sagar Island]].{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} Between Malda and the Bay of Bengal, the Hooghly river passes the towns and cities of [[Murshidabad]], [[Nabadwip]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Howrah]].\n\nAfter entering [[Bangladesh]], the main branch of the Ganges is known as the [[Padma River|Padma]]. The Padma is joined by the [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna River]], the largest distributary of the [[Brahmaputra]]. Further downstream, the Padma joins the [[Meghna River]], the second largest distributary of the Brahmaputra, and takes on the Meghna's name as it enters the Meghna Estuary, which empties into the Bay of Bengal.

About 84% of the total rainfall occurs in the monsoon from June to September. Consequently, [[streamflow]] in the Ganges is highly seasonal. The average dry season to monsoon discharge ratio is about 1:6, as measured at [[Hardinge Bridge]]. This strong seasonal variation underlies many problems of land and water resource development in the region.{{sfn|Mirza|2004}} The seasonality of flow is so acute it can cause both drought and [[flood]]s. Bangladesh, in particular, frequently experiences drought during the dry season and regularly suffers extreme floods during the monsoon.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|p=133}}\n\nIn the Ganges Delta many large rivers come together, both merging and [[River bifurcation|bifurcating]] in a complicated network of [[Channel (geography)|channels]]. The two largest rivers, the Ganges and [[Brahmaputra]], both split into distributary channels, the largest of which merge with other large rivers before themselves joining. This current channel pattern was not always the case. Over time the rivers in Ganges Delta have [[Avulsion (river)|changed course]], sometimes altering the network of channels in significant ways.\n\nBefore the late 12th century the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary was the main channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill-channel. The main flow of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the [[Adi Ganga]]. Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma channels were more or less equally significant. After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} It is thought that the Bhagirathi-Hooghly became increasingly choked with silt, causing the main flow of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River. By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges.{{sfn|Parua|2009}} One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, together instead of separately. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago.<ref name=\"Catling1992\">{{cite book|last=Catling|first=David|title=Rice in deep water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5JxwKx1RAgC&pg=PA175|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1992|publisher=[[International Rice Research Institute]]|isbn=978-9712200052|page=175}}</ref>\n\nAlso near the end of the 18th century, the course of the lower Brahmaputra changed dramatically, altering its relationship with the Ganges. In 1787 there was a great flood on the [[Teesta River]], which at the time was a tributary of the Ganges-Padma River. The flood of 1787 caused the Teesta to undergo a sudden change course (an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]]), shifting east to join the Brahmaputra and causing the Brahmaputra to shift its course south, cutting a new channel. This new main channel of the Brahmaputra is called the Jamuna River. It flows south to join the Ganges-Padma. Since ancient times the main flow of the Brahmaputra was more easterly, passing by the city of [[Mymensingh]] and joining the Meghna River. Today this channel is a small distributary but retains the name Brahmaputra, sometimes Old Brahmaputra.<ref name=\"Britannica-Brahmaputra\">{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2011 |title= Brahmaputra River |encyclopedia= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |edition= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library |url= http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-48056 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> The site of the old Brahmaputra-Meghna confluence, in the locality of [[Langalbandh]], is still considered sacred by Hindus.

The original purpose of the barrage, which was completed in 1975, was to divert up to {{convert|1100|m3/s|abbr=on}} of water from the Ganges to the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary in order to restore navigability at the [[Port of Kolkata]].

In 1996 a 30-year treaty was signed with Bangladesh. The terms of the agreement are complicated, but in essence they state that if the Ganges flow at Farakka was less than {{convert|2000|m3/s|abbr=on}} then India and Bangladesh would each receive 50% of the water, with each receiving at least {{convert|1000|m3/s|abbr=on}} for alternating ten-day periods. However, within a year the flow at Farakka fell to levels far below the historic average, making it impossible to implement the guaranteed sharing of water. In March 1997, flow of the Ganges in Bangladesh dropped to its lowest ever, {{convert|180|m3/s|abbr=on}}. Dry season flows returned to normal levels in the years following, but efforts were made to address the problem.

While this is happening, his body on earth, however, is being picked at by vultures, one of whom flies away with a foot bone. Another bird comes after the vulture, and in fighting him off, the vulture accidentally drops the bone into the Ganges below.

Soon their husband, Vishnu, arrives and decides to calm the situation by separating the goddesses. He orders Sarasvati to become the wife of Brahma, Ganga to become the wife of Shiva, and Lakshmi, as the blameless conciliator, to remain as his own wife. Ganga and Sarasvati, however, are so distraught at this dispensation, and wail so loudly, that Vishnu is forced to take back his words.

Auckland's successor as Governor General, [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]], appeared less receptive to large-scale public works, and for the duration of his tenure, withheld major funds for the project. Only in 1844, when a new Governor-General, [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Lord Hardinge]], was appointed, did official enthusiasm and funds return to the Ganges canal project. Although the intervening impasse had seemingly affected Cautley's health and required him to return to Britain in 1845 for recuperation, his European sojourn gave him an opportunity to study contemporary hydraulic works in the United Kingdom and Italy. By the time of his return to India even more supportive men were at the helm, both in the [[North-Western Provinces]], with [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|James Thomason]] as Lt. Governor, and in [[British India]] with [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor-General.

The objective of this centrally funded scheme was to treat the effluent from all the major towns along the Ganges and reduce pollution in the river by at least 75%. The Ganga Action Plan built upon the existing, but weakly enforced, 1974 Water Prevention and Control Act. A government audit of the Ganga Action Plan in 2000 reported limited success in meeting effluent targets. Development plans for sewage treatment facilities were submitted by only 73% of the cities along the Ganges, and only 54% of these were judged acceptable by the authorities. Not all the cities reported how much effluent was being treated, and many continued to discharge raw sewage into the river. Test audits of installed capacity indicated poor performance, and there were long delays in constructing planned treatment facilities. After 15 yr. of implementation, the audit estimated that the Ganga Action Plan had achieved only 14% of the anticipated sewage treatment capacity. The environmental impact of this failure has been exacerbated by the removal of large quantities of irrigation water from the Ganges which offset any gains from effluent reductions.\"\n----}} a \"major failure\".{{efn|name=haberman|1= {{harvtxt|Haberman|2006}}<br />\"The Ganga Action Plan, commonly known as GAP, was launched dramatically in the holy city of Banares (Varanasi) on 14 June 1985, by Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who promised, {{'}}We shall see that the waters of the Ganga become clean once again.{{'}} The stated task was {{'}}to improve water quality, permit safe bathing all along the 2,525 kilometers from the Ganges's origin in the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, and make the water potable at important pilgrim and urban centres on its banks.{{'}} The project was designed to tackle pollution from twenty-five cities and towns along its banks in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal by intercepting, diverting, and treating their effluents. With the GAP's Phase II, three important tributaries\u2014Damodar, Gomati, and Yamuna\u2014were added to the plan. Although some improvements have been made to the quality of the Ganges's water, many people claim that the GAP has been a major failure. The environmental lawyer M. C. Mehta, for example, filed public interest litigation against project, claiming {{'}}GAP has collapsed.{{'}}\"\n----}}{{efn|name=gardner|1={{harvtxt|Gardner|2003}}<br />\"The Ganges, also known as the Ganga, is one of the world's major rivers, running for more than 2,500 kilometres from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal. It is also one of the most polluted, primarily from sewage, but also from animal carcasses, human corpses, and soap and other pollutants from bathers. Indeed, scientists measure fecal coliform levels at thousands of times what is permissible and levels of oxygen in the water are similarly unhealthy. Renewal efforts have centred primarily on the government-sponsored Ganga Action Plan (GAP), started in 1985 with the goal of cleaning up the river by 1993. Several western-style sewage treatment plants were built along the river, but they were poorly designed, poorly maintained and prone to shut down during the region's frequent power outages. The GAP has been a colossal failure, and many argue that the river is more polluted now than it was in 1985.\" (pa.166)\n----}}{{efn|name=bharati|1= {{harvtxt|Bharati|2006}}<br />\"The World Bank estimates the health costs of water pollution in India to be equivalent to three per cent of the country's gross domestic product. With Indian rivers being severely polluted, interlinking them may actually increase these costs. Also, with the widely recognised failure of the Ganga Action Plan, there is a danger that contaminants from the Gangetic basin might enter other basins and destroy their natural cleansing processes. The new areas that will be river-fed after the introduction of the scheme may experience crop failures or routing due to alien compounds carried into their streams from the polluted Gangetic basin streams.\" (p. 26)\n----}}\n\nAccording to one study,<ref name=mandal>{{Citation|last=Mandal|first=R.

The expenditure was almost doubled. But the result was not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt to make it a success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of dirty water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of dirty clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.</blockquote>\n\nThe failure of the Ganga Action Plan, has also been variously attributed to \"environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions,\"{{efn|name=singh|1= {{harvtxt| Singh|Singh|2007}}<br />\"In February 1985, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India launched the Ganga Action Plan, an environmental project to improve the river water quality. It was the largest single attempt to clean up a polluted river anywhere in the world and has not achieved any success in terms of preventing pollution load and improvement in water quality of the river. Failure of the Ganga Action Plan may be directly linked with the environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions. The bibliography of selected environmental research studies on the Ganga River is, therefore, an essentially first step for preserving and maintaining the Ganga River ecosystem in future.\"\n----}} Indian \"traditions and beliefs,\"{{efn|1= {{harvtxt|Tiwari|2008}}<br />\"Many social traditions and customs are not only helping in environmental degradation but are causing obstruction to environmental management and planning. The failure of the Ganga Action Plan to clean the sacred river is partly associated to our traditions and beliefs. The disposal of dead bodies, the immersion of idols and public bathing are the part of Hindu customs and rituals which are based on the notion that the sacred river leads to the path of salvation and under no circumstances its water can become impure. Burning of dead bodies through wood, bursting of crackers during Diwali, putting thousands of tonnes of fuel wood under fire during Holi, immersion of Durga and Ganesh idols into rivers and seas etc. are part of Hindu customs and are detrimental to the environment.

It is the sixth installment in the ''[[Gundam]]'' franchise, taking place in the \"After Colony\" timeline.  As with the [[Mobile Suit Gundam|original series]], the plot of ''Gundam Wing'' centers on a war in the future (specifically the 2220s) between Earth and its orbital colonies in the Earth-Moon system.\n\nThe series aired in [[Japan]] on the terrestrial [[TV Asahi]] network. It ran for 49 episodes; beginning on April 7, 1995 and ending on March 29, 1996. It received multiple [[manga]] adaptations, as well as video games. Four [[original video animation]] (OVA) episodes were produced including a retelling of the series, ''Operation Meteor'', and a direct sequel, ''[[Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz|Endless Waltz]]''. In 2010, Sumizawa started writing the novel ''[[New Mobile Report Gundam Wing: Frozen Teardrop|Frozen Teardrop]]'', another sequel to the series. While the series fared modestly well in Japan, it found greater success in the United States and popularized the ''Gundam'' franchise in the West.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing characters}}\nIn the distant future, Mankind has colonized space, with clusters of space colonies at each of the five Earth-Moon [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange points]]. Down on the Earth, the nations have come together to form the United Earth Sphere Alliance. This Alliance oppresses the colonies with its vast military might. The colonies wishing to be free, join together in a movement headed by the pacifist Heero Yuy. In the year After Colony 175, Yuy is shot dead by an assassin, forcing the colonies to search for other paths to peace. The assassination prompts five disaffected scientists from the Organization of the Zodiac, more commonly referred to as OZ, to turn rogue upon the completion of the mobile suit prototype Tallgeese.\n\nThe story of ''Gundam Wing'' begins in the year After Colony 195, with the start of \"Operation Meteor\": the scientists' plan for revenge against OZ. The operation involves five teenage boys, who have each been chosen and trained by each of the five scientists, then sent to Earth independently in extremely advanced mobile suits (one designed by each of the scientists) known as \"Gundams\" (called such because they are constructed from a rare and astonishingly durable material called Gundanium alloy, which can only be created in outer space). Each Gundam is sent from a different colony, and the pilots are initially unaware of each other's existence.\n\nThe series focuses primarily on the five Gundam pilots: [[List of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing characters#Heero Yuy|Heero Yuy]] (an alias, not to be confused with the martyred pacifist), [[List of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing characters#Duo Maxwell|Duo Maxwell]], [[List of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing characters#Trowa Barton|Trowa Barton]], [[List of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing characters#Quatre Raberba Winner|Quatre Raberba Winner]] and [[List of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing characters#Chang Wufei|Chang Wufei]]. Their mission is to use their Gundams to attack OZ directly, in order to rid the Alliance of its weapons and free the colonies from its oppressive rule. The series also focuses on [[List of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing characters#Relena Peacecraft|Relena Peacecraft]], heir to the pacifist Sanc Kingdom, who starts off as a seemingly ordinary girl until she gets caught up in the conflict between OZ and the Gundams; becoming an important political ally to the Gundam pilots (particularly Heero) in the process.\n\n==Production==\nThe making of ''Gundam Wing'' was influenced by ''[[Mobile Fighter G Gundam]]'' with the idea of having five main characters. Originally, the series was meant to be titled ''Gundam Meteor'' after \"Operation Meteor.\" Bandai suggested having a Gundam with the ability of transforming into a plane-like form. The writers worked together for one week conceptualizing the characters, mobile suits and first 40 episodes. Director Masashi Ikeda reacted to their work comparing it to the first ''Gundam'' series, ''[[Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam|Zeta]]'' and ''G'' all at once.<ref name=\"gundamw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gundam-w.jp/special/taidan.html|script-title=ja:\uff15\u4f53\u306e\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u307e\u3063\u305f\u300c\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\uff37\u300d\u306e\u4f01\u753b|publisher=Gundam W|accessdate=December 16, 2013|language=Japanese}}</ref> The series was more focused on drama than mecha, which the staff credits as one of the reasons for the show's popularity within the female demographic.\n\nWriter Katsuyuki Sumizawa expressed difficulties in the making of the story as opposed to his work in novels due to the fact he relayed duties to other members. However, the handling of the five characters was made easy due to the setting.<ref name=\"gundamw\"/> Early sketches of the protagonists by Ikeda were handled by character designer Shuko Murase. He was cast due to his work with Ikeda in ''[[Samurai Troopers]]''. The director wanted the designs to appeal to the female demographic. Originally, Duo Maxwell was set as the protagonist but was replaced by Heero Yuy. The staff members noted Heero was too different from previous Gundam protagonists and were afraid he would be unpopular. The voice casting was more difficult to do than the ones from previous series due to the different atmosphere.<ref name=\"gundamw\"/>\n\nFollowing the series' ending, the staff members were asked by the studio to make a sequel due to its popularity. Neither Ikeda nor executive producer Hideyuki Tomioka intended to make a sequel for ''Gundam Wing''. However, Sumizawa was bothered by the finale as he felt the series ended abruptly. Tomioka asked Sumizawa if he could write a continuation which he agreed.<ref name=\"gundamw\"/>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Anime===\n{{Main|List of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing episodes}}\n''Gundam Wing'' was not the first series in the ''Gundam'' franchise to be [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] and distributed in the U.S. (the compilation movie version of the original ''Mobile Suit Gundam'', as well as the [[Original video animation|OVAs]] ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket|War in the Pocket]]'' and ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory|Stardust Memory]]'', preceded it by about two years), but it is well known as the first ''Gundam'' series to be aired on American television.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahq.net/animation/gundam/wing/gwseries.htm |title=Mobile Suit Gundam Wing |accessdate=2007-02-14 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Mecha Anime HQ |pages= |archiveurl=  https://web.archive.org/web/20061118021539/http://www.mahq.net/animation/gundam/wing/gwseries.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=2006-11-18|quote= }}</ref> The series aired on [[Cartoon Network]]'s weekday afternoon programing block [[Toonami]]; premiering on March 6, 2000. In the first extended promo leading up to the series' premiere, voice actor [[Peter Cullen]] narrated the back story, evoking memories of ''[[Voltron]]'s'' opening credits. The promo was said to be so riveting that [[Bandai Entertainment|Bandai]] decided to use it as the official promo for the series.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImR8f701y_Q| title = Gundam Wing trailer | accessdate = 2013-02-01 | publisher = YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIt was broadcast in two formats; an edited version shown in the daytime on [[Toonami]] and an uncut version shown past midnight as part of Toonami's \"Midnight Run.\" Examples of the edits included the removal of blood, profanity, atheism, and the word \"kill\" being replaced with the word \"destroy\" (this was extended to Duo's nickname, \"The God of Death,\" changed to \"The Great Destroyer,\" forcing the alteration of two episode titles), though the word \"death\" was mostly left intact. All ''Gundam Wing'' episodes have been released to [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] in the U.S. Differences between the two video systems is that the VHS episodes contain the edited version while the DVD episodes contain the uncut version.\n\nDue to the closure of Bandai Entertainment, the series was out-of-print for sometime. On October 11, 2014 at their 2014 [[New York Comic-Con]] panel, Sunrise announced they will be releasing all of the Gundam franchise, including ''Gundam Wing'' in North America though distribution from [[Right Stuf Inc.]], beginning in Spring 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-10-11/sunrise-partners-with-right-stuf-to-release-gundam-franchise-stateside/.79830|title=Sunrise Partners with Right Stuf to Release Gundam Franchise Stateside|publisher= [[Anime News Network]]|date=2014-10-11|accessdate=2014-10-12}}</ref> Right Stuf released the series on Blu-ray and DVD in two sets in November 2017.<ref name=\"Blu-ray\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-08-12/right-stuf-details-g-gundam-gundam-wing-anime-releases/.120051|title=Right Stuf Details G Gundam, Gundam Wing Anime Releases|publisher=Anime News Network|date=August 12, 2017|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}</ref> In addition, a collector's edition set containing the complete series, ''Endless Waltz'', ''Operation Meteor'' and the ''Frozen Teardrop'' picture drama was released in December 2017.\n\n===OVAs===\nAfter the series ended, four [[original video animation]] (OVA) episodes, compiling various scenes from the series along with a few minutes of new footage, were released in 1996 as ''Gundam Wing: Operation Meteor'' I and II. \n\nA three-part OVA titled ''[[Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz]]'' was produced in 1997 as a sequel to the TV series; plot-wise, it brought the \"After Colony\" timeline to a close.

''R''(''x'',''y'')) holds in all [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structures]] (only the simplest 8 are shown left). By G&ouml;del's completeness result, it must hence have a [[natural deduction]] proof (shown right).]]\n'''G\u00f6del's completeness theorem''' is a fundamental theorem in [[mathematical logic]] that establishes a correspondence between [[semantics|semantic]] truth and syntactic [[Provability logic|provability]] in [[first-order logic]]. It makes a close link between [[model theory]] that deals with what is true in different models, and [[proof theory]] that studies what can be formally proven in particular [[formal system]]s.\n\nIt was first proved by [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] in 1929. It was then simplified in 1947, when [[Leon Henkin]] observed in his [[Ph.D.]] [[thesis]] that the hard part of the proof can be presented as the Model Existence Theorem (published in 1949). Henkin's proof was simplified by [[Gisbert Hasenjaeger]] in 1953.\n\n==Preliminaries==\nThere are numerous [[deductive system]]s for first-order logic, including systems of [[natural deduction]] and [[Hilbert-style deduction system|Hilbert-style systems]]. Common to all deductive systems is the notion of a '''formal deduction'''. This is a sequence (or, in some cases, a finite [[tree structure|tree]]) of formulas with a specially-designated '''conclusion'''. The definition of a deduction is such that it is finite and that it is possible to verify [[algorithm]]ically (by a [[computer]], for example, or by hand) that a given sequence (or tree) of formulas is indeed a deduction.\n\nA first-order formula is called '''[[Validity (logic)|logically valid]]''' if it is true in every [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] for the language of the formula (i.e. for any assignment of values to the variables of the formula). To formally state, and then prove, the completeness theorem, it is necessary to also define a deductive system. A deductive system is called '''complete''' if every logically valid formula is the conclusion of some formal deduction, and the completeness theorem for a particular deductive system is the theorem that it is complete in this sense. Thus, in a sense, there is a different completeness theorem for each deductive system. A converse to completeness is '''[[soundness theorem|soundness]],''' the fact that only logically valid formulas are provable in the deductive system.\n\nIf some specific deductive system of first-order logic is sound and complete, then it is \"perfect\" (a formula is provable if and only if it is logically valid), thus equivalent to any other deductive system with the same quality (any proof in one system can be converted into the other).\n\n==Statement of the theorem==\n\nWe first fix a deductive system of first-order predicate calculus, choosing any of the well-known equivalent systems.  G\u00f6del's original proof assumed the Hilbert-Ackermann proof system.\n\n===G\u00f6del's original formulation===\n\nThe completeness theorem says that if a formula is logically valid then there is a finite deduction (a formal proof) of the formula.\n\nThus, the deductive system is \"complete\" in the sense that no additional inference rules are required to prove all the logically valid formulas. A converse to completeness is '''[[soundness theorem|soundness]],''' the fact that only logically valid formulas are provable in the deductive system. Together with soundness (whose verification is easy), this theorem implies that a formula is logically valid [[if and only if]] it is the conclusion of a formal deduction.\n\n===More general form===\n\nThe theorem can be expressed more generally in terms of [[logical consequence]].  We say that a sentence ''s'' is a '''syntactic consequence''' of a theory ''T'', denoted <math>T\\vdash s</math>, if ''s'' is provable from ''T'' in our deductive system.  We say that ''s'' is a '''semantic consequence''' of ''T'', denoted <math>T\\models s</math>, if ''s'' holds in every [[model (mathematical logic)|model]] of ''T''.  The completeness theorem then says that for any first-order theory ''T'' with a [[well-order]]able language, and any sentence ''s'' in the language of ''T'',\n\n:if <math>T\\models s</math>, then <math>T\\vdash s</math>.\n\nSince the converse (soundness) also holds, it follows that <math>T\\models s</math> iff <math>T\\vdash s</math>, and thus that syntactic and semantic consequence are equivalent for first-order logic.\n\nThis more general theorem is used implicitly, for example, when a sentence is shown to be provable from the axioms of [[group theory]] by considering an arbitrary group and showing that the sentence is satisfied by that group.\n\nG\u00f6del's original formulation is deduced by taking the particular case of a theory without any axiom.\n\n===Model existence theorem===\n\nThe completeness theorem can also be understood in terms of [[consistency]], as a consequence of Henkin's [[Consistency#Henkin.27s_theorem|model existence theorem]].  We say that a theory ''T'' is '''syntactically consistent''' if there is no sentence ''s'' such that both ''s'' and its negation \u00ac''s'' are provable from ''T'' in our deductive system.  The model existence theorem says that for any first-order theory ''T'' with a well-orderable language,\n\n:if <math>T</math> is syntactically consistent, then <math>T</math> has a model.\n\nAnother version, with connections to the [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]], says:\n\n:Every syntactically consistent, [[countable]] first-order theory has a finite or countable model.\n\nGiven Henkin's theorem, the completeness theorem can be proved as follows: If <math>T \\models s</math>, then <math>T\\cup\\lnot s</math> does not have models. By the contrapositive of Henkin's, then <math>T\\cup\\lnot s</math> is syntactically inconsistent. So a contradiction (<math>\\bot</math>) is provable from <math>T\\cup\\lnot s</math> in the deductive system. Hence <math>(T\\cup\\lnot s) \\vdash \\bot</math>, and then by the properties of the deductive system, <math>T\\vdash s</math>.\n\n===As a theorem of arithmetic===\n\nThe Model Existence Theorem and its proof can be formalized in the framework of [[Peano arithmetic]]. Precisely, we can systematically define a model of any consistent effective first-order theory ''T'' in Peano arithmetic by interpreting each symbol of ''T'' by an arithmetical formula whose free variables are the arguments of the symbol. However, the definition expressed by this formula is not recursive.\n\n==Consequences==\nAn important consequence of the completeness theorem is that it is possible to [[enumerable set|recursively enumerate]] the semantic consequences of any [[effectively computable|effective]] first-order theory, by enumerating all the possible formal deductions from the axioms of the theory, and use this to produce an enumeration of their conclusions. \n\nThis comes in contrast with the direct meaning of the notion of semantic consequence, that quantifies over all structures in a particular language, which is clearly not a recursive definition.\n\nAlso, it makes the concept of \"provability,\" and thus of \"theorem,\" a clear concept that only depends on the chosen system of axioms of the theory, and not on the choice of a proof system.\n\n==Relationship to the incompleteness theorem==\n\n[[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]], another celebrated result, shows that there are inherent limitations in what can be achieved with formal proofs in mathematics. The name for the incompleteness theorem refers to another meaning of ''complete'' (see [[Model theory#Using the compactness and completeness theorems|model theory \u2013 Using the compactness and completeness theorems]]).\n\nIt shows that in any [[consistent]] [[effectively computable|effective]] theory ''T'' containing [[Peano arithmetic]] (PA), the formula ''C<sub>T</sub>'' expressing the consistency of ''T'' cannot be proven within ''T''.\n\nApplying the completeness theorem to this result, gives the existence of a model of ''T'' where the formula ''C<sub>T</sub>'' is false. Such a model (precisely, the set of \"natural numbers\" it contains) is necessarily [[Non-standard model of arithmetic|non-standard]], as it contains the code number of a proof of a contradiction of ''T''.\nBut ''T'' is consistent when viewed from the outside. Thus this code number of a proof of contradiction of ''T'' must be a non-standard number.\n\nIn fact, the model of ''any'' theory containing PA obtained by the systematic construction of the arithmetical model existence theorem, is ''always'' non-standard with a non-equivalent provability predicate and a non-equivalent way to interpret its own construction, so that this construction is non-recursive (as recursive definitions would be unambiguous).\n\nAlso, [[Tennenbaum's theorem|there is no recursive non-standard model of PA]].\n\n==Relationship to the compactness theorem==\nThe completeness theorem and the [[compactness theorem]] are two cornerstones of first-order logic. While neither of these theorems can be proven in a completely [[effectively computable|effective]] manner, each one can be effectively obtained from the other.\n\nThe compactness theorem says that if a formula \u03c6 is a logical consequence of a (possibly infinite) set of formulas \u0393 then it is a logical consequence of a finite subset of \u0393. This is an immediate consequence of the completeness theorem, because only a finite number of axioms from \u0393 can be mentioned in a formal deduction of \u03c6, and the soundness of the deductive system then implies \u03c6 is a logical consequence of this finite set. This proof of the compactness theorem is originally due to G\u00f6del.\n\nConversely, for many deductive systems, it is possible to prove the completeness theorem as an effective consequence of the compactness theorem.\n\nThe ineffectiveness of the completeness theorem can be measured along the lines of [[reverse mathematics]]. When considered over a countable language, the completeness and compactness theorems are equivalent to each other and equivalent to a weak form of choice known as [[weak K\u00f6nig's lemma]], with the equivalence provable in RCA<sub>0</sub> (a second-order variant of [[Peano arithmetic]] restricted to induction over  \u03a3<sup>0</sup><sub style=\"margin-left:-0.6em\">1</sub> formulas). Weak K\u00f6nig's lemma is provable in ZF, the system of [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] without axiom of choice, and thus the completeness and compactness theorems for countable languages are provable in ZF. However the situation is different when the language is of arbitrary large cardinality since then, though the completeness and compactness theorems remain provably equivalent to each other in ZF, they are also provably equivalent to a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]] known as [[Boolean prime ideal theorem#The ultrafilter lemma|the ultrafilter lemma]]. In particular, no theory extending ZF can prove either the completeness or compactness theorems over arbitrary (possibly uncountable) languages without also proving the ultrafilter lemma on a set of same cardinality, knowing that on countable sets, the ultrafilter lemma becomes equivalent to weak K\u00f6nig's lemma.\n\n==Completeness in other logics==\nThe completeness theorem is a central property of [[first-order logic]] that does not hold for all logics. [[Second-order logic]], for example, does not have a completeness theorem for its standard semantics (but does have the completeness property for [[Henkin semantics]]), and the set of logically-valid formulas in second-order logic is not recursively enumerable. The same is true of all higher-order logics. It is possible to produce sound deductive systems for higher-order logics, but no such system can be complete.\n\n[[Lindstr\u00f6m's theorem]] states that first-order logic is the strongest (subject to certain constraints) logic satisfying both compactness and completeness.\n\nA completeness theorem can be proved for [[modal logic]] or [[intuitionistic logic]] with respect to [[Kripke semantics]].\n\n==Proofs==\nG\u00f6del's [[Original proof of G\u00f6del's completeness theorem|original proof of the theorem]] proceeded by reducing the problem to a special case for formulas in a certain syntactic form, and then handling this form with an ''ad hoc'' argument.\n\nIn modern logic texts, G\u00f6del's completeness theorem is usually proved with [[Leon Henkin|Henkin]]'s proof, rather than with G\u00f6del's original proof. Henkin's proof directly constructs a [[term model]] for any consistent first-order theory.

It is accessible by paved road and is set aside as a [[nature preserve]].  A continuous section is available from beds that are clearly Precambrian into beds that are clearly Cambrian.  The boundary is set at the first appearance of a complex trace fossil ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' that is found worldwide.  The Fortune Head GSSP is unlikely to be washed away or built over. Nonetheless, ''Treptichnus pedum'' is less than ideal as a marker fossil as it is not found in every Cambrian sequence, and it is not assured that it is found at the same level in every exposure. In fact, further eroding its value as a boundary marker, it has since been identified in strata 4m ''below'' the GSSP!<ref>{{Cite journal| author =    | first = J.| first2 = S.

There is no [[radiometric dating|radiometrically datable]] bed at the boundary at Fortune Head, but there is one slightly above the boundary in similar beds nearby.\nThese factors have led some geologists{{who|date=March 2016}} to suggest that this GSSP is in need of reassigning.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nOnce a GSSP boundary has been agreed upon, a \"golden spike\" is driven into the geologic section to mark the precise boundary for future geologists (though in practice the \"spike\" need neither be golden nor an actual spike).  The first stratigraphic boundary was defined in 1977 by identifying the [[Silurian]]-[[Devonian]] boundary with a bronze plaque at a locality called [[Klonk]], northeast of the village of Suchomasty in the [[Czech Republic]].  GSSPs are also sometimes referred to as '''Golden Spikes'''.\n\n==Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages==\n{{main article|Global Standard Stratigraphic Age}}\nBecause defining a GSSP depends on finding well-preserved geologic sections and identifying key events, this task becomes more difficult as one goes farther back in time.  Before 630 million years ago, boundaries on the geologic timescale are defined simply by reference to fixed dates, known as \"Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Geology to Paleobiology}}\n\n*[[Body form]]\n*[[European Mammal Neogene]]\n*[[Fauna (animals)]]\n*[[Geologic time scale]]\n**[[New Zealand geologic time scale]]\n*[[List of GSSPs]]\n*[[North American Land Mammal Age]]\n*[[Type locality (geology)|Type locality]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n==References==\n* Hedberg, H.D., (editor), ''International stratigraphic guide: A guide to stratigraphic classification, terminology, and procedure'', New York, John Wiley and Sons, 1976\n* [http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/charts/chart.html International Stratigraphic Chart] from the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]]\n* [http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/gssp/index.php?parentid=all  GSSP table with pages on each ratified GSSP] from the ICS Subcommission for Stratigraphic Information\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080923230940/http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/USGSNPS/gtime/gtime1.html USA National Park Service]\n* [http://astro.wsu.edu/worthey/earth/html/md08.html Washington State University]\n* [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/help/timeform.html Web Geological Time Machine]\n* [http://www.pballew.net/arithm16.html#aeon Eon or Aeon], [http://www.pballew.net/etyindex.html Math Words - An alphabetical index]\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090113224346/http://www.stratigraphy.org/over.htm The Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP)]: overview\n*[http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/charts/chart.html Chart of The Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSP)]: chart\n*[http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/gssp/index.php?parentid=all# Table of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSPs) with links to summary pages for each one]: chart\n*[http://www.rocksandminerals.com/geotime/geotime.htm Geotime chart displaying geologic time periods compared to the fossil record] - Deals with chronology and classifications for laymen (not GSSPs)\n\n{{Chronology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Global Boundary Stratotype Section And Point}}\n[[Category:Earth sciences]]\n[[Category:Geochronologically significant locations]]\n[[Category:Geologic time scales of Earth]]\n[[Category:Historical geology]]\n[[Category:Paleogeography]]\n[[Category:Paleobiology]]\n[[Category:Units of time]]\n[[Category:Stratigraphy]]", "sha1": "1woexhnfqp50rbw6fobrtosoyrr213a"}}, {"title": "Gabrielle DAnnunzio", "ns": "0", "id": "12453", "redirect": {"title": "Gabriele D'Annunzio"}, "revision": {"id": "558360098", "parentid": "136857892", "timestamp": "2013-06-04T23:05:25Z", "contributor": {"username": "BDD", "id": "146242"}, "comment": "fixing double redirect", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]", "sha1": "8sicqjj6y3b145hhg56vz7le4to55yv"}}, {"title": "Gough Whitlam", "ns": "0", "id": "12454", "revision": {"id": "863547032", "parentid": "863537930", "timestamp": "2018-10-11T13:35:42Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ivar the Boneful", "id": "31504254"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted 2 edits by [[Special:Contributions/203.213.54.110|203.213.54.110]] ([[User talk:203.213.54.110|talk]]) to last revision by Ivar the Boneful.

The [[Australian Labor Party|Leader of the Labor Party]] from 1967 to 1977, Whitlam led his party to power for the first time in 23 years at the [[Australian federal election, 1972|1972 election]]. He won the [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 election]] before being controversially dismissed by the [[Governor-General of Australia]], Sir [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]], at the climax of the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]]. Whitlam remains the only Australian prime minister to have his commission terminated in that manner.\n\nWhitlam served as an [[Navigator#In aviation|air navigator]] in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] for four years during [[World War II]], and worked as a [[barrister]] following the war. He was first elected to [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] in 1952, representing [[Division of Werriwa|Werriwa]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Whitlam became Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in 1960, and in 1967, after the retirement of [[Arthur Calwell]], was elected Leader and became the [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]]. After narrowly losing the [[Australian federal election, 1969|1969 election]], Whitlam led Labor to victory at the 1972 election after 23 years of continuous [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|Country]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition Government]].\n\nThe [[Whitlam Government]] implemented a large number of new programs and policy changes, including the termination of [[Conscription in Australia|military conscription]], institution of [[universal health care]] and free [[university education]], and the implementation of [[legal aid]] programs. With the opposition-controlled [[Australian Senate|Senate]] delaying passage of bills, Whitlam called a [[double dissolution]] election in 1974 in which he won a majority in the House of Representatives, albeit a slightly reduced one, and picked up three Senate seats. The Whitlam government then instituted the first and only [[Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament of 1974|joint sitting]] enabled under s. 57 of the Constitution as part of the double dissolution process. Despite the government's second election victory, the opposition, reacting to government scandals and a flagging economy suffering from the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the [[1973\u201375 recession]], continued to obstruct the government's program in the Senate. In late 1975, the Opposition Senators refused to allow a vote on the government's [[appropriation bill]]s, returning them to the House of Representatives with a demand that the government go to an election, thus denying the government [[confidence and supply|supply]]. Whitlam refused to back down, arguing that his government, which held a clear majority in the House of Representatives, was being held to ransom by the Senate. The crisis ended on 11 November, when Whitlam arrived at a pre-arranged meeting with the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, at Government House in order to call a half-Senate election. Kerr dismissed him and commissioned the opposition leader, [[Malcolm Fraser]], as prime minister. Labor lost the [[Australian federal election, 1975|subsequent election]] by a landslide.\n\nWhitlam stepped down after losing again at the [[Australian federal election, 1977|1977 election]], and retired from parliament in 1978. Upon the election of the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke Government]] in 1983, he was appointed as Ambassador to [[UNESCO]], a position he filled with distinction, and was elected a member of the UNESCO Executive Board. He remained active into his nineties. The propriety and circumstances of his dismissal and the legacy of his government have been frequently debated in the decades after he left office.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Ngara, Gough Whitlam's birthplace.jpg|thumb|left|Ngara, Gough Whitlam's birthplace, now demolished]]\n\nEdward Gough Whitlam was born on 11 July 1916 at the family home [[Gough Whitlam's birthplace|'Ngara']], 46 Rowland Street,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trustadvocate.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ngara-46-Rowland-St-Kew-citation-150514-docx.docx |title=National Trust Heritage Citation |date= |accessdate=2016-08-10}}</ref> [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]], a suburb of [[Melbourne]].

Whitlam responded to McEwen by stating that [[Benjamin Disraeli]] had been heckled in his maiden speech and had responded, \"The time will come when you shall hear me.\" He told McEwen, \"The time will come when you may interrupt me.\" According to early Whitlam biographers [[Laurie Oakes]] and David Solomon, this cool response put the Coalition government on notice that the new Member for Werriwa would be a force to be reckoned with.{{sfn|Oakes|Solomon|1973|p=54}}\n\nIn the rough and tumble debate in the House of Representatives, Whitlam called fellow MHR [[Bill Bourke]] \"this grizzling [[Quisling]]\", [[Garfield Barwick]] (who would, as High Court Chief Justice, play a role in Whitlam's downfall) a \"bumptious bastard\", and stated that [[Bill Wentworth]] exhibited a \"hereditary streak of insanity\".{{sfn|Hocking|2008|p=172}} After calling future prime minister [[William McMahon]] a \"[[quean]]\", he apologised.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|p=172}}\n\nThe ALP had been out of office since the [[Ben Chifley|Chifley]] Government's defeat in 1949 and, since 1951, had been under the leadership of [[H. V. Evatt|Bert Evatt]], whom Whitlam greatly admired.  In 1954, the ALP seemed likely to return to power. The Prime Minister, [[Robert Menzies]], adroitly used the [[Petrov Affair|defection of a Soviet official]] to his advantage, and [[Coalition (Australia)|his coalition]] of the Liberal and [[National Party of Australia|Country]] parties was returned in the [[Australian federal election, 1954|1954 election]] with a seven-seat majority. After the election, Evatt attempted to purge the party of [[Industrial Groups|industrial groupers]], who had long dissented from party policy, and who were predominantly Catholic and anti-communist. The ensuing division in the ALP, which came to be known as \"[[Australian Labor Party split of 1955|The Split]]\", sparked the birth of the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]] (DLP). It was a conflict that helped to keep Labor out of power for a generation, since DLP supporters chose the Liberal Party in [[Instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]]. Whitlam supported Evatt throughout this period.{{sfn|Lloyd|2008|pp=332\u2013333}}\n\nIn 1955, a redistribution divided Whitlam's electorate of Werriwa in two, with his Cronulla home located in the new electorate of [[Division of Hughes|Hughes]]. Although Whitlam would have received ALP support in either division, he chose to continue standing for Werriwa and moved from Cronulla to [[Cabramatta, New South Wales|Cabramatta]]. This meant even longer journeys for his older children to attend school, since neither electorate had a high school at the time, and they attended school in Sydney.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\nWhitlam was appointed to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Constitutional Review in 1956. Biographer [[Jenny Hocking]] calls his service on the committee, which included members from all parties in both chambers of Parliament, one of the \"great influences in his political development\".{{sfn|Hocking|2008|p=181}} According to Hocking, service on the committee caused Whitlam to focus not on internal conflicts consuming the ALP, but on Labor goals which were possible and worthwhile in the constitutional framework. Many Labor goals, such as nationalisation, ran contrary to the Constitution. Whitlam came to believe that the Constitution\u2014and especially Section 96 (which allowed the federal government to make grants to the states)\u2014could be used to advance a worthwhile Labor programme.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=181\u2013186}}\n\n===Deputy Leader, 1960\u20131967===\nBy the late 1950s Whitlam was seen as a leadership contender once the existing Labor leaders exited the scene. Most of the party's major figures, including Evatt, Deputy Leader [[Arthur Calwell]], [[Eddie Ward]], and [[Reg Pollard]], were in their sixties, twenty years older than Whitlam.{{sfn|Lloyd|2008|p=333}} In 1960, after losing three elections, Evatt resigned and was replaced by Calwell, with Whitlam defeating Ward for deputy leader.{{sfn|Lloyd|2008|pp=333\u2013334}} Calwell came within a handful of votes of winning the cliffhanger [[Australian federal election, 1961|1961 election]]. He had not wanted Whitlam as deputy leader, and believed Labor would have won if Ward had been in the position.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=218\u2013219}}\n[[File:Gough Whitlam 1962.jpg|thumb|left|Whitlam in 1962]]\nSoon after the 1961 election, events began to turn against Labor. When President [[Sukarno]] of Indonesia announced that he intended to take over [[West New Guinea]] as the colonial Dutch departed, Calwell responded by declaring that Indonesia must be stopped by force.  Calwell's statement was called \"crazy and irresponsible\" by Prime Minister Menzies, and the incident reduced public support for the ALP.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=219\u2013220}} At that time, the Federal Conference of the Labor Party, which dictated policy to parliamentary members, consisted of six members from each state, but not Calwell or Whitlam. In early 1963 a special conference met in a Canberra hotel to determine Labor policy regarding a proposed US base in northern Australia; Calwell and Whitlam were photographed by ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' peering in through the doors, waiting for the verdict. In an accompanying story, [[Alan Reid (journalist)|Alan Reid]] of the ''Telegraph'' wrote that Labor was ruled by \"36 [[faceless men]]\". The Liberals seized on it, issuing a leaflet called \"Mr Calwell and the Faceless Men\" which accused Calwell and Whitlam of taking direction from \"36 unknown men, not elected to Parliament nor responsible to the people.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.aus-vn2247771-1 |title=Digital Collections \u2013 Books \u2013 Item 1: Mr. Calwell and the Faceless Men |publisher=National Library of Australia|date= |accessdate=26 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nMenzies manipulated the Opposition on issues that bitterly divided it, such as direct aid to the states for private schools, and the proposed base. He called an [[Australian federal election, 1963|early election]] for November 1963, standing in support of those two issues. The Prime Minister performed better than Calwell on television and received an unexpected boost after the assassination of US President [[John F. Kennedy]]. As a result, the Coalition easily defeated Labor on a 10-seat swing. Whitlam had hoped Calwell would step down after 1963, but he remained, reasoning that Evatt had been given three opportunities to win, and that he should be allowed a third try.{{sfn|Lloyd|2008|p=334}} Calwell dismissed proposals that the ALP leader and deputy leader should be entitled to membership of the party's conference (or on its governing 12-person Federal Executive, which had two representatives from each state), and instead ran successfully for one of the conference's Victoria seats.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=232\u2013233}} Labor did badly in a 1964 by-election in the Tasmanian [[Division of Denison|electorate of Denison]], and lost seats in the 1964 half-Senate election.  The party was also defeated in the state elections in the most populous state, New South Wales, surrendering control of the state government for the first time since 1941.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nWhitlam's relationship with Calwell, never good, deteriorated further after publication of a 1965 article in ''[[The Australian]]''. The article reported off-the-record comments Whitlam had made that his leader was \"too old and weak\" to win office, and that the party might be gravely damaged by an \"old-fashioned\" 70-year-old Calwell seeking his first term as prime minister.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=240\u2013241}} Later that year, at Whitlam's urging, and over Calwell's objection, the biennial party conference made major changes to the party's platform: deleting support for the [[White Australia policy]] and making the ALP's leader and deputy leader ''ex officio'' members of the conference and executive, along with the party's leader and deputy leader in the Senate. As Whitlam considered the Senate unrepresentative, he opposed the admission of its ALP leaders to the party's governing bodies.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=244\u2013248}}\n\nMenzies retired in January 1966, and was succeeded as prime minister by the new Liberal Party leader, [[Harold Holt]].{{sfn|Hocking|2008|p=248}} After years of politics being dominated by the elderly Menzies and Calwell, the younger Holt was seen as a breath of fresh air, and attracted public interest and support in the run-up to the [[Australian federal election, 1966|November election]].{{sfn|Hocking|2008|p=248}}\n\nIn early 1966, the 36-member conference, with Calwell's assent, banned any ALP parliamentarian from supporting federal assistance to the states for spending on both government and private schools, commonly called \"state aid\". Whitlam broke with the party on the issue, and was charged with gross disloyalty by the executive, an offence which carried the penalty of expulsion from the party.  Before the matter could be heard, Whitlam left for [[Queensland]], where he campaigned intensively for the ALP candidate [[Rex Patterson]] in the [[Dawson by-election, 1966|Dawson by-election]].  The ALP won, dealing the government its first by-election defeat since 1952. Whitlam survived the expulsion vote by a margin of only two, gaining both Queensland votes.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=250\u2013256}} At the end of April, Whitlam challenged Calwell for the leadership; though Calwell received two-thirds of the vote, he announced that if the party lost the upcoming election, he would not stand again for the leadership.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=257\u2013258}}\n\nHolt called an election for November 1966, in which Australia's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] was a major issue.  Calwell called for an \"immediate and unconditional withdrawal\" of Australian troops from Vietnam. Whitlam, however, said that this would deprive Australia of any voice in a settlement, and that regular troops, rather than conscripts, should remain under some circumstances.{{sfn|Oakes|Solomon|1973|p=59}} Calwell considered Whitlam's remark disastrous, disputing the party line just five days before the election. The ALP suffered a crushing defeat; the party was reduced to 41 seats in the House of Representatives. Shortly after the election, Whitlam faced another expulsion vote for his stance on Vietnam, and survived.<ref>Hancock, Ian.

At the [[Australian Labor Party Caucus|caucus]] meeting on 8 February 1967, Whitlam was elected party leader, defeating leading left-wing candidate Dr [[Jim Cairns]].{{sfn|Hocking|2008|p=271}}\n\n==Leader of the Opposition, 1967\u20131972==\n\n===Reforming the ALP===\nWhitlam believed the Labor Party had little chance of being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the traditional working-class base to include the suburban middle class.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=3}} He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, and hoped that even rank-and-file party members could be given a voice in the conference.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=95}} In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate [[Brian Harradine]], a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist.<ref>Lawrence, Jeff [http://www.unitedvoice.org.au/news/vale-ray-gietzelt Vale Ray Gietzelt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407162330/http://www.unitedvoice.org.au/news/vale-ray-gietzelt |date=7 April 2015 }} at [[United Voice]], 20 December 2012, citing ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' obituary of Ray Gietzelt: \"Kingmaker fought for democratisation of unions\".</ref> Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding a vote of confidence from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38\u201332 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.{{sfn|Lloyd|2008|pp=337\u2013339}}\n\nWith the ALP's governing bodies unwilling to reform themselves, Whitlam worked to build support for change among ordinary party members. He was successful in reducing union influence in the party, though he was never able to give the rank and file a direct vote in selecting the executive.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|pp=95\u201396}} The Victoria branch of the party had long been a problem; its executive was far to the left of the rest of the ALP, and had little electoral success. Whitlam was able to reconstruct the Victoria party organisation against the will of its leaders, and the reconstituted state party proved essential to victory in the 1972 election.{{sfn|Lloyd|2008|pp=337\u2013339}}\n\nBy the time of the 1969 party conference, Whitlam had gained considerable control over the ALP. That conference passed 61&nbsp;resolutions, including broad changes to party policy and procedures. It called for the establishment of an Australian Schools Commission to consider the proper level of state aid for schools and universities, recognition of Aboriginal land claims, and expanded party policy on [[universal health care]].{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=321\u2013325}} The conference also called for increased federal involvement in urban planning, and would form the basis of \"The Program\" of modern socialism which Whitlam and the ALP would present to the voters in 1972.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=325\u2013326}}\n\nSince 1918, Labor had called for the abolition of the existing Australian Constitution, with the vesting of all political power in Parliament, a plan which would turn the states into powerless geographic regions. Beginning in 1965, Whitlam had sought to change this goal. He finally succeeded at the 1971 ALP Conference in [[Launceston, Tasmania]], which called for Parliament to receive \"such plenary powers as are necessary and desirable\" to achieve the ALP's goals in domestic and international affairs.{{sfn|Sawer|1977|p=3}} Labor also pledged to abolish the Senate; this goal would not be erased from the party platform until 1979, after Whitlam had stepped down as leader.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=12}}\n\n===Leader of the Opposition===\n[[File:Gough and Margaret Whitlam - Holt's memorial service.jpg|thumb|right|Whitlam and his wife Margaret entering the memorial service for Harold Holt in December 1967]]\nSoon after taking the leadership, Whitlam reorganised the ALP caucus, assigning portfolios and turning the Labor frontbench into a [[shadow cabinet]].{{sfn|Lloyd|2008|p=337}} While the Liberal-Country Coalition had a huge majority in the House of Representatives, Whitlam energised the party by campaigning intensively to win two by-elections in 1967: first in [[Division of Corio|Corio]] in Victoria, and later that year in [[Division of Capricornia|Capricornia]] (Queensland). The [[Australian Senate election, 1967|November half-Senate election]] saw a moderate swing to Labor and against the Coalition, compared with the general election the previous year.{{sfn|Brown|2002|pp=50\u201351}} These federal victories, in which both Whitlam and Holt campaigned, helped give Whitlam the leverage he needed to carry out party reforms.{{sfn|Oakes|Solomon|1973|p=10}}\n\nAt the end of 1967, Holt [[Disappearance of Harold Holt|vanished while swimming in rough seas]] near Melbourne; his body was never recovered.{{sfn|Brown|2002|pp=54\u201355}} John McEwen, as leader of the junior Coalition partner, the Country Party, took over as prime minister for three weeks until the Liberals could elect a new leader. Senator [[John Gorton]] won the vote and became prime minister.{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=78}} The leadership campaign was conducted mostly by television, and Gorton appeared to have the visual appeal needed to keep Whitlam out of office.{{sfn|Oakes|Solomon|1973|p=36}} Gorton resigned his seat in the Senate, and in February 1968 won [[Higgins by-election, 1968|the by-election]] for Holt's seat of [[Division of Higgins|Higgins]] in Victoria.{{sfn|Henderson|2008|p=307}} For the remainder of the year, Gorton appeared to have the better of Whitlam in the House of Representatives. In his chronicle of the Whitlam years, however, speechwriter [[Graham Freudenberg]] asserts that Gorton's erratic behaviour, Whitlam's strengthening of his party, and events outside Australia (such as the Vietnam War) ate away at Liberal dominance.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=127}}\n\nGorton called [[Australian federal election, 1969|an election for October 1969]]. Whitlam and the ALP, with little internal dissension, stood on a platform calling for domestic reform, an end to conscription, and the withdrawal of Australian troops from Vietnam by 1 July 1970.{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=94}} Whitlam knew that, given the ALP's poor position after the 1966 election, victory was unlikely.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=332\u2013335}} Nevertheless, Whitlam scored an 18-seat swing, Labor's best performance since losing government in 1949.  Although the Coalition was returned for an eighth term in government, it was with a slim majority of seven seats, down from 41 after the writs were dropped.{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=94}} Labor actually won a bare majority of the two-party vote; only DLP preferences in four Melbourne-area seats kept Whitlam from becoming prime minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2007/results/senate/vic.htm|title=Senate Results: Victoria \u2013 Federal Election 2007 \u2013 ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|publisher=}}</ref> [[Australian Senate election, 1970|The 1970 half-Senate election]] brought little change to Coalition control, but the Liberal vote fell for the first time below 40&nbsp;per cent, representing a severe threat to Gorton's leadership.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|p=365}}\n\nIn March 1971, the resentment against Gorton came to a head when a confidence vote in the Liberal caucus resulted in a tie.  Declaring that this was a sign he no longer had the confidence of the party, Gorton resigned, and William McMahon was elected his successor.{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=94}} With the Liberals in turmoil, Whitlam and the ALP sought to gain public trust as a credible government-in-waiting. The party's actions, such as its abandonment of the White Australia policy, gained favourable media attention.{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=110}} The Labor leader flew to [[Papua New Guinea]] and pledged himself to the independence of what was then an Australian possession.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|pp=197\u2013199}} In 1971, Whitlam flew to [[Beijing]] and met with Chinese officials, including [[Zhou Enlai]].{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=377\u2013379}} McMahon attacked Whitlam for the visit and claimed that the Chinese had manipulated him. This attack backfired when US President [[Richard Nixon]] announced that [[1972 Nixon visit to China|he would visit China]] the following year. His [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], [[Henry Kissinger]], visited Beijing between 9\u201311 July (less than a week after Whitlam's visit of 4\u20136 July), and (unknown to Whitlam) some of Kissinger's staff had actually been in Beijing preparing for Kissinger's visit at the same time as the Labor delegation. According to Whitlam biographer Jenny Hocking, the incident transformed Whitlam into an international statesman,{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=379\u2013380}} while McMahon was seen as reacting defensively to Whitlam's foreign policy ventures.{{sfn|Brown|2002|pp=110\u2013111}} Other errors by McMahon, such as a confused ad-lib speech while visiting Washington, and a statement to Indonesia's President [[Suharto]] that Australia was a \"west European nation\", also damaged the government.{{sfn|Brown|2002|pp=107\u2013113}}\n[[File:Gough Whitlam 1972 policy speech.jpg|thumb|left|Whitlam giving a speech during the 1972 election campaign]]\nBy early 1972, Labor had established a clear lead in the polls; indeed, for the first time since 1955 its support was greater than the combined vote for the Coalition and DLP.{{sfn|Sekuless|2008|pp=322\u2013323}}<ref name=1972archives>Hancock, Ian.

The government recovered slightly in the August Budget session of Parliament, proposing income tax cuts and increased spending.{{sfn|Sekuless|2008|pp=322\u2013323}} The Labor strategy for the run-up to the election was to sit back and allow the Coalition to make mistakes. Whitlam controversially stated in March that \"draft-dodging is not a crime\" and that he would be open to a revaluation of the [[Australian dollar]].{{sfn|Oakes|Solomon|1973|p=87}} With the Coalition sinking in the polls and his own personal approval ratings down as low as 28 percent, McMahon waited as long as he could, finally calling [[Australian federal election, 1972|an election]] for the House of Representatives for 2 December. Whitlam noted that the polling day was the anniversary of the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] \u2013 at which another \"ramshackle, reactionary coalition\" had been given a \"crushing defeat\".\n\nLabor campaigned under the slogan \"[[It's Time (Australian campaign)|It's Time]]\", an echo of Menzies' successful 1949 slogan, \"It's Time for a Change\". Surveys showed that even Liberal voters approved of the Labor slogan.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|p=384}} Whitlam pledged an end to conscription and the release of individuals who had refused the draft; an income tax surcharge to pay for universal health insurance; free dental care for students; and renovation of aging urban infrastructure. The party pledged to eliminate university tuition fees and establish a schools commission to evaluate educational needs.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|pp=393\u2013394}} The party benefited from the support of the proprietor of [[News Limited]], [[Rupert Murdoch]], who preferred Whitlam over McMahon.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|p=385}} Labor was so dominant in the campaign that some of Whitlam's advisers urged him to stop joking about McMahon; people were feeling sorry for him.{{sfn|Hocking|2008|p=387}} The election saw the ALP increase its tally by 12&nbsp;seats, mostly in suburban Sydney and Melbourne, for a majority of nine in the House of Representatives.

The Senate at that time consisted of ten members from each of the six states, elected by [[proportional representation]].{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=45\u201346}} Historically, when Labor won government, the parliamentary caucus chose the ministers, with the party leader only having the power to assign portfolios.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|pp=255\u2013257}} However, the new Labor caucus would not meet until after the final results came in on 15 December. In the meantime, McMahon would remain caretaker prime minister.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|pp=245\u2013246}} Whitlam, however, was unwilling to wait that long.  On 5 December, with Labor's win beyond doubt even though counting was still underway, Whitlam had the Governor-General, [[Paul Hasluck|Sir Paul Hasluck]], swear him in as prime minister and Labor's deputy leader, [[Lance Barnard]], as deputy prime minister. The two men held 27 portfolios during the two weeks before a full cabinet could be determined.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=246}}\n\nDuring the two weeks the so-called \"[[duumvirate]]\" held office, Whitlam sought to fulfill those campaign promises that did not require legislation.  Whitlam ordered negotiations to establish full relations with the People's Republic of China, and broke those with Taiwan.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=251}} Legislation allowed the defence minister to grant exemptions from conscription.

However, Freudenberg noted that the rapid pace and public excitement caused by the duumvirate's actions caused the Opposition to be wary of giving Labor too easy a time, and gave rise to one post-mortem assessment of the Whitlam government: \"We did too much too soon.\"{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=253}}\n\n===Enacting a programme===\n[[File:Third Whitlam Ministry.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the [[Third Whitlam Ministry]] in 1974]]\nThe McMahon government had consisted of 27&nbsp;ministers, twelve of whom comprised the Cabinet.

Murphy believed that ASIO might have files relating to threats against Yugoslav Prime Minister [[D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107]], who was about to visit Australia, and feared ASIO might conceal or destroy them.{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=124}} The Opposition attacked the Government over the raid, terming Murphy a \"loose cannon\". A Senate investigation of the incident was cut short when Parliament was dissolved in 1974.{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=125}} According to journalist and author Wallace Brown, the controversy over the raid continued to dog the Whitlam government throughout its term, because the incident was \"so silly\".{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=124}}\n\nFrom the start of the Whitlam government, the Opposition, led by [[Billy Snedden]] (who replaced McMahon as Liberal leader in December 1972) sought to use control of the Senate to baulk Whitlam.{{sfn|Lloyd|2008|pp=340\u2013341}} It did not seek to block all government legislation; the Coalition senators, led by Senate Liberal leader [[Reg Withers]], sought to block government legislation only when the obstruction would advance the Opposition's agenda.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=36\u201337}} The Whitlam government also had troubles in relations with the states. New South Wales refused the government's request that it close the Rhodesian Information Centre in Sydney. The Queensland premier, [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] refused to consider any adjustment in Queensland's border with Papua New Guinea, which, due to the state's ownership of islands in the [[Torres Strait]], came within half a kilometre (about one-third of a mile) of the Papuan mainland.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=255}} Liberal state governments in New South Wales and Victoria were re-elected by large margins in 1973.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=48\u201349}} Whitlam and his majority in the House of Representatives proposed [[Australian referendum, 1973|a constitutional referendum]] in December 1973, transferring control of wages and prices from the states to the federal government.  The two propositions failed to attract a majority of voters in any state, and were rejected by over 800,000&nbsp;votes nationwide.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=49}}\n\n{{main article|Gair Affair}}\nBy early 1974, the Senate had rejected nineteen government bills, ten of them twice. With a half-Senate election due by mid-year, Whitlam looked for ways to shore up support in that body.  Queensland senator and former DLP leader [[Vince Gair]] signalled his willingness to leave the Senate for a diplomatic post.  Gair's term would not expire until the following half-Senate election (or upon a double dissolution election). With five Queensland seats at stake in the half-Senate election, the ALP would probably win only two, but if six (including Gair's) were at stake, the party likely would win a third. Possible control of the Senate was therefore at stake; Whitlam agreed to Gair's request and had Governor-General Sir Paul Hasluck appoint him ambassador to Ireland. Word leaked of Gair's pending resignation, and Whitlam's opponents attempted to counteract his manoeuvre. On what became known as the \"Night of the Long Prawns\", Country Party members secreted Gair at a small party in a legislative office as the ALP searched for him to secure his written resignation. As Gair enjoyed beer and prawns, Bjelke-Petersen advised the Queensland governor, [[Colin Hannah|Sir Colin Hannah]], to issue writs for only the usual five vacancies, since Gair's seat was not yet vacant, effectively countering Whitlam's plan.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=100\u2013107}}\n\nThe Senate had refused to pass six bills after their twice being passed by the House of Representatives. With the Opposition threatening to disrupt money [[confidence and supply|supply]] to government, Whitlam used the Senate's recalcitrance to trigger a [[double dissolution]] election, holding it instead of the half-Senate election.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=299}} After a campaign featuring the Labor slogan \"Give Gough a fair go\", [[Australian federal election, 1974|the Whitlam government was returned]], with its majority in the House of Representatives cut from seven to five and increasing its Senate seats by three.

This session, authorised by the new governor-general, [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], passed bills providing for universal health insurance (known then as Medibank, today as [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]]) and providing the Northern Territory and [[Australian Capital Territory]] with representation in the Senate, effective at the next election.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=62\u201363}}\n\n===Second term, 1974\u20131975===\n[[File:Whitlam Lingiari Image 3.jpg|thumb|Gough Whitlam and [[Vincent Lingiari]] in 1975]]\nBy mid-1974, Australia was in an economic slump, suffering from the [[1973 oil crisis]] and [[1973\u201375 recession]]. The 1973 oil crisis had caused prices to spike and, according to government figures, inflation topped 13&nbsp;percent for over a year between 1973 and 1974.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=118\u2013119}} Part of the inflation was due to Whitlam's desire to increase wages and conditions of the Commonwealth Public Service as a pacesetter for the private sector.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=160}} The Whitlam government had cut tariffs by 25&nbsp;percent in 1973; 1974 saw an increase in imports of 30&nbsp;percent and a $1.5&nbsp;billion increase in the [[trade deficit]]. Primary producers of commodities such as beef were caught in a [[credit squeeze]] as short-term rates rose to extremely high levels.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=118\u2013119}} Unemployment also rose significantly.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=160}} Unease within the ALP led to Barnard's defeat when Jim Cairns challenged him for his deputy leadership. Whitlam gave little help to his embattled deputy, who had formed the other half of the duumvirate.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\nDespite these economic indicators, the Budget presented in August 1974 saw large increases in spending, especially in education.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=183}} Treasury officials had advised a series of tax and fee increases, ranging from excise taxes to the cost of posting a letter; their advice was mostly rejected by Cabinet.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=308}} The Budget was unsuccessful in dealing with the inflation and unemployment, and Whitlam introduced large tax cuts in November. He also announced additional spending to help the private sector.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=183}}\n\nBeginning in October 1974, the Whitlam government sought overseas loans to finance its development plans, with the newly enriched oil nations a likely target.  Whitlam attempted to secure financing before informing the [[Loan Council]] (which included state officials hostile to Whitlam), and his government empowered Pakistani financier [[Tirath Khemlani]] as an intermediary in the hope of securing US$4&nbsp;billion in loans. While the [[Loans Affair]] never resulted in an actual loan,{{sfn|Brown|2002|pp=128\u2013129}} according to author and Whitlam speechwriter Graham Freudenberg, \"The only cost involved was the cost to the reputation of the Government. That cost was to be immense\u2014it was government itself.\"{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=348}}\n\nWhitlam appointed Senator Murphy to the High Court, even though Murphy's Senate seat would not be up for election if a half-Senate election were held. Labor then held three of the five short-term New South Wales Senate seats. Under proportional representation, Labor could hold its three short-term seats in the next half-Senate election but, if Murphy's seat were also contested, Labor was unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, a Murphy appointment meant the almost certain loss of a seat in the closely divided Senate at the next election.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=206}} Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill [[casual vacancies in the Australian Parliament|casual vacancies]] were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, [[Tom Lewis (Australian politician)|Tom Lewis]] felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect [[Cleaver Bunton]], former mayor of [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]] and an independent.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=206\u2013208}} By March 1975, many Liberal parliamentarians felt that Snedden was doing an inadequate job as leader of the Opposition, and that Whitlam was dominating him in the House of Representatives.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=315}} [[Malcolm Fraser]] challenged Snedden for the leadership, and defeated him on 21 March.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=317}}\n\nSoon after Fraser's accession, controversy arose over the Whitlam government's actions in trying to restart peace talks in Vietnam. As the North prepared to end the civil war, Whitlam sent cables to both Vietnamese governments, telling Parliament that both cables were substantially the same.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|pp=338\u2013340}} The Opposition contended he had misled Parliament, and a motion to censure Whitlam was defeated along party lines.<ref name=\"The Age 14 May 1975\" /> The Opposition also attacked Whitlam for not allowing enough South Vietnamese refugees into Australia, with Fraser calling for the entry of 50,000. Freudenberg alleges that 1,026&nbsp;Vietnamese refugees entered Australia in the final eight months of the Whitlam government, and only 399 in 1976 under Fraser.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=342}} However, by 1977, Australia had accepted over five thousand refugees.<ref name=\"The Dispatch 15 December 1977\" />\n\nAs the political situation deteriorated, Whitlam and his government continued to enact legislation: The [[Family Law Act 1975]] provided for no-fault divorce while the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]] caused Australia to ratify the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] that Australia had signed under Holt, but which had never been ratified. In August 1975, Whitlam gave the [[Gurindji people]] of the Northern Territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands, beginning the process of Aboriginal land reform. The next month, Australia granted independence to Papua New Guinea.<ref name=\"In Office\" />\n\n[[File:Suharto-Whitlam House.JPG|thumb|The Suharto-Whitlam House in [[Dieng Plateau]], [[Indonesia]], where Whitlam discussed the future of [[East Timor]] with Indonesia's President [[Suharto]] in 1974]]\nFollowing the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]], Portugal began a process of decolonisation and began a withdrawal from [[Portuguese Timor]] (later [[East Timor]]). Australians had long taken an interest in the colony; the nation had sent troops to the region during [[Battle of Timor|World War II]], and many East Timorese had fought the Japanese as guerrillas.{{sfn|Cotton|2004|pp=4\u20135}} In September 1974, Whitlam met with President Suharto in Indonesia and indicated that he would support Indonesia if it [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|annexed East Timor]].<ref name=\"Dunn 1996\" /> At the height of the [[Cold War]], and in the context of the American retreat from Indo-China, he felt that incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia would enhance the stability of the region, and reduce the risk of the East Timorese [[FRETILIN]] movement, which many feared was communist, coming to power.{{sfn|Cotton|2004|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nWhitlam had offered Barnard a diplomatic post; in early 1975 Barnard agreed to this, triggering [[Bass by-election, 1975|a by-election]] in his Tasmanian electorate of [[Division of Bass|Bass]]. The election on 28 June proved a disaster for Labor, which lost the seat with a swing against it of 17&nbsp;percent.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=106}} The next week, Whitlam fired Barnard's successor as deputy prime minister, Cairns, who had misled Parliament regarding the Loans Affair amid controversy about his relationship with his office manager, [[Junie Morosi]].{{sfn|Lloyd|2008|p=345}} At the time of Cairns's dismissal, one Senate seat was vacant, following the death on 30 June of Queensland ALP Senator [[Bertie Milliner]]. The state Labor party nominated [[Mal Colston]], resulting in a deadlock. The unicameral Queensland legislature twice voted against Colston, and the party refused to submit any alternative candidates. Bjelke-Petersen finally convinced the legislature to elect a low-level union official, [[Albert Field]], who had contacted his office and expressed a willingness to serve. In interviews, Field made it clear he would not support Whitlam. Field was expelled from the ALP for standing against Colston, and Labor senators boycotted his swearing-in.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=107\u2013109}} Whitlam argued that, because of the manner of filling vacancies, the Senate was \"corrupted\" and \"tainted\", with the Opposition enjoying a majority they did not win at the ballot box.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=109}}\n\n==Dismissal==\n{{main article|1975 Australian constitutional crisis}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction=horizontal\n | width1=140\n | image1=John Kerr 1965.jpg\n | caption1=<center>[[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]]</center>\n | width2=140\n | image2=Malcolm Fraser 1968.jpg\n | caption2=<center>[[Malcolm Fraser]]</center>\n | align=right\n }}\nIn October 1975, the Opposition, led by Malcolm Fraser, determined to withhold supply by deferring consideration of appropriation bills. With Field on leave (his Senate appointment having been challenged), the Coalition had an effective majority of 30\u201329 in the Senate. The Coalition believed that if Whitlam could not deliver supply, and would not [[advice (constitutional)|advise]] new elections, Kerr would have to dismiss him.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=267}} Supply would run out on 30&nbsp;November.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=389}}\n\nThe stakes were raised in the conflict on 10 October, when the High Court declared valid the Act granting the territories two senators each. In a half-Senate election, most successful candidates would not take their places until 1 July 1976, but the territories' senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats, would assume their seats immediately. This gave Labor an outside chance of controlling the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\nOn 14 October, Labor minister [[Rex Connor]], mastermind of the loans scheme, was forced to resign when Khemlani released documents showing that Connor had made misleading statements. The continuing scandal bolstered the Coalition in their stance that they would not concede supply.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=112}} Whitlam on the other hand, convinced that he would win the battle, was glad of the distraction from the Loans Affair, and believed that he would \"smash\" not only the Senate, but Fraser's leadership as well.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=377}}\n\nWhitlam told the House of Representatives on 21 October,\n{{quote|Let me place my government's position clearly on the record. I shall not advise the Governor-General to hold an election for the House of Representatives on behalf of the Senate. I shall tender no advice for an election of either House or both Houses until this constitutional issue is settled. This government, so long as it retains a majority in the House of Representatives, will continue the course endorsed by the Australian people last year.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=372}}}}\n\nWhitlam and his ministers repeatedly claimed that the Opposition was damaging not only the constitution, but the economy as well. The Coalition senators remained united, though several became increasingly concerned about the tactic of blocking supply.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=376}} As the crisis dragged into November, Whitlam attempted to make arrangements for public servants and suppliers to be able to cash cheques at banks. These transactions would be temporary loans which the government would repay once supply was restored.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=390}} This plan to prolong government without supply was presented to Kerr unsigned on 6 November, under the title \"Draft Joint Opinion\" (ostensibly of solicitor-general [[Maurice Byers]] and attorney-general [[Kep Enderby]]). It proposed that public employees, including members of the armed forces and police, \"could assign arrears of pay by way of mortgage\". The government's refusal to formalise this and other \"advice\" was a factor justifying the Governor-General's fateful resort to alternative legal advice.<ref name=jkerr>Kerr, John ''Matters for Judgment'', Macmillan 1978, pp&nbsp;301\u2013308</ref>\n\nGovernor-General Kerr was following the crisis closely. At a luncheon with Whitlam and several of his ministers on 30 October, Kerr suggested a compromise: if Fraser conceded supply, Whitlam would agree not to call the half-Senate election until May or June 1976, or alternatively would agree not to call the Senate into session until after 1 July. Whitlam rejected the idea, seeking to end the Senate's right to deny supply.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=382\u2013383}} On 3 November, after a meeting with Kerr, Fraser proposed that if the government agreed to hold a House of Representatives election at the same time as the half-Senate election, the Coalition would concede supply. Whitlam rejected this offer, stating that he had no intention of advising a House election for at least a year.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=386\u2013387}}\n\nWith the crisis unresolved, Kerr decided to dismiss Whitlam as prime minister.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=215}} Fearing that Whitlam would go to [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] and potentially have him removed, the Governor-General gave Whitlam no prior hint.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=217}} He conferred (against Whitlam's advice) with High Court Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, who agreed that he had the power to dismiss Whitlam.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=225}}\n\nA meeting among the party leaders, including Whitlam and Fraser, to resolve the crisis on the morning of 11 November came to nothing.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=404\u2013405}} Kerr and Whitlam met at the Governor-General's office that afternoon at 1.00&nbsp;pm. Unknown to Whitlam, Fraser was waiting in an ante-room; Whitlam later stated that he would not have set foot in the building if he had known Fraser was there.{{sfn|Whitlam|1979|p=108}} Whitlam, as he had told Kerr by phone earlier that day, came prepared to advise a half-Senate election, to be held on 13&nbsp;December.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=256}} Kerr instead told Whitlam that he had terminated his commission as prime minister, and handed him a letter to that effect.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=256\u2013257}} After the conversation, Whitlam returned to the Prime Minister's residence, [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]], had lunch and conferred with his advisers. Immediately after his meeting with Whitlam, Kerr commissioned Fraser as 'caretaker' Prime Minister, on the assurance he could obtain supply and would then advise Kerr to dissolve both houses for election.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=295}}\n\nIn the confusion, Whitlam and his advisers did not immediately tell any Senate members of the dismissal, with the result that when the Senate convened at 2.00&nbsp;pm, the appropriation bills were rapidly passed, with the ALP senators assuming the Opposition had given in.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|pp=295\u2013297}} The bills were soon sent to Kerr to receive [[Royal Assent]]. At 2.34&nbsp;pm, ten minutes after supply had been secured, Fraser rose in the House and announced he was prime minister. Whitlam immediately moved a no confidence motion against the new prime minister in the House, which instructed the Speaker, [[Gordon Scholes]], to advise Kerr to reinstate Whitlam.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=269\u2013273}}\n\nKerr refused to receive Scholes, keeping him waiting for more than an hour while he prorogued Parliament by proclamation: his Official Secretary, [[David Smith (Australian public servant)|David Smith]], came to [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] to proclaim the dissolution from the front steps. A large, angry crowd had gathered, and Smith was nearly drowned out by their noise. He concluded with the traditional \"God save the Queen\". The dismissed prime minister, Whitlam, who had been standing behind Smith, then addressed the crowd:{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=274\u2013275}}\n\n<blockquote>\nWell may we say \"God save the Queen\", because nothing will save the Governor-General! The Proclamation which you have just heard read by the Governor-General's Official Secretary was countersigned Malcolm Fraser, who will undoubtedly go down in Australian history from Remembrance Day 1975 as Kerr's cur.

Early rallies drew huge crowds, with attendees handing Whitlam money to pay election expenses. The crowds greatly exceeded those in any of Whitlam's earlier campaigns; in Sydney, 30,000&nbsp;partisans gathered for an ALP rally in [[The Domain, Sydney|The Domain]] below a banner: \"Shame Fraser Shame\".{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=302}} Fraser's appearances drew protests, and a letter bomb sent to Kerr was defused by authorities. Instead of making a policy speech to keynote his campaign, Whitlam made a speech attacking his opponents and calling 11 November \"a day which will live in infamy\".{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=303}}\n\nPolls from the first week of campaigning showed a nine-point swing against Labor, which would have decimated Labor if repeated in an election. Whitlam's campaign team disbelieved the results at first, but additional polling returns were clear: the electorate had turned against Labor. The Coalition attacked Labor for economic conditions, and released television commercials including \"The Three Dark Years\" showing images from Whitlam government scandals. The ALP campaign, which had concentrated on the issue of Whitlam's dismissal, did not address the economy until its final days. By that time Fraser, confident of victory, was content to sit back, avoid specifics and make no mistakes.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|pp=303\u2013307}} On election night, 13 December, the Coalition won the largest majority government in Australian history, winning 91 seats to Labor's 36. Labor suffered a 6.5 percent swing against it and its caucus was cut almost in half, suffering a 30-seat swing. Labor was left with five fewer seats than it had when Whitlam took the leadership.

Whitlam rivalled Menzies in his passion for the House of Representatives and ability to use it as his stage, and yet his parliamentary skills were rhetorical and not tactical. He could devise a strategy and then often botch the tactics in trying to implement that strategy.&nbsp;... Above all he was a man of grand vision with serious blind spots.{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=120}}\n</blockquote>\n\nWhitlam's last words in the documentary film ''Gough Whitlam \u2013 In His Own Words'' (2002) were in response to a question about his status as an icon and elder statesman.

They are attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', a collection of epic poetry compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, in the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], and in the poetry of [[skald]]s.

Agnarr is told that Odin feeds Geri and Freki while the god himself consumes only wine:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>[[Benjamin Thorpe]] translation:</small>\n:Geri and Freki the war-wont sates,\n:the triumphant sire of hosts;\n:but on wine only the famed in arms,\n:Odin, ever lives.<ref name=THORPE21>Thorpe (1907:21).</ref>\n|\n:<small>[[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] translation:</small>\n:Freki and Geri does Heerfather feed,\n:The far-famed fighter of old:\n:But on wine alone does the weapon-decked god,\n:Othin, forever live.<ref name=BELLOWS92>Bellows (1923:92).</ref>\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\n\nThe pair is also alluded to via the [[kenning]] \"[[List of names of Odin|Vi\u00f0rir]]'s (Odin's) hounds\" in ''[[Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana I]]'', verse 13, where it is related that they roam the field \"greedy for the corpses of those who have fallen in battle\".<ref>Lincoln views this activity as the reason behind their epithet \"ravenous\" or \"greedy\". See Lincoln (1991:99).</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>[[Benjamin Thorpe]] translation:</small>\n:The warriors went to the trysting place of swords,\n:which they had appointed at Logafi\u00f6ll.\n:Broken was Frodi's peace between the foes:\n:Vidrir\u2019s hounds went about the isle slaughter-greedy.<ref>Thorpe (1907:138).</ref>\n|\n:<small>[[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] translation:</small>\n:The warriors forth to the battle went,\n:The field they chose at Logafjoll;\n:Frothi's peace midst foes they broke,\n:Through the isle went hungrily Vithrir's hounds.<ref>Bellows (1936:295-296).</ref>\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' (chapter 38), the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] explains that Odin gives all of the food on his table to his wolves Geri and Freki and that Odin requires no food, for wine is to him both meat and drink.

Spiegel believes this to point to the pan-Germanic wolf-warrior band cult centered on Odin that waned away after [[Christianization]].<ref name=\"SPIEDEL24-38\">Spiedel (2004:24\u201428). Specialists in classical and early medieval history have reviewed Spiedel's book very unfavorably; Halsall (2006), who observes \"all in all it does its author and publisher little credit,\" is typical.</ref>\n\nScholars have also noted [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] parallels to the wolves Geri and Freki as companions of a divinity. 19th century scholar [[Jacob Grimm]] observed a connection between this aspect of Odin's character and the Greek [[Apollo]], to whom both the wolf and the raven are sacred.<ref name=GRIMM147>Grimm (1882:147).</ref> Philologist [[Maurice Bloomfield]] further connected the pair with the two dogs of [[Yama]] in Vedic mythology, and saw them as a Germanic counterpart to a more general and widespread Indo-European \"[[Cerberus]]\"-theme.<ref>Bloomfield also mentions another Nordic pair in this connection: ''Geri'' \"Greedy\" and ''Gifr'' \"Violent\" are two dogs which guard the maiden Mengl\u00f6\u00f0 in the ''[[Fj\u00f6lsvinnsm\u00e1l]]''. See Bloomfeld (1908:316-318).</ref> Michael Speidel finds similar parallels in the [[Vedic period|Vedic]] [[Rudra]] and the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. Elaborating on the connection between wolves and figures of great power, he writes: \"This is why Geri and Freki, the wolves at Woden's side, also glowered on the throne of the Anglo-Saxon kings. Wolf-warriors, like Geri and Freki, were not mere animals but mythical beings: as Woden's followers they bodied forth his might, and so did wolf-warriors.\"<ref name=SPIEDEL24-38/>\n\n[[Bernd Heinrich]] theorizes that Geri and Freki, along with Odin and his ravens [[Huginn and Muninn]], reflect a [[symbiosis]] observed in the natural world among ravens, wolves, and humans on the hunt:\n<blockquote>\n:In a biological symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As in such a symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) who were part of him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered to the ends of the earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part\u2014he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.<ref name=\"HEINRICH-355\">Heinrich (2006 [1999]: 355). For discussion of wolf and raven symbiosis, see for example Heinrich (2006 [1999]: 226-235).

Dronke notes that [[\u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr of Hvinir]] also plays on the term in his ''[[Haustl\u00f6ng|Haustl\u01ebng]]'', with \"ginnunga v\u00e9\".</ref> An alternative etymology links the ''ginn-'' prefix  with that found in terms with a sacral meaning, such as ''ginn-heilagr'', ''ginn-regin'' (both referring to the gods) and ''ginn-runa'' (referring to the runes), thus interpreting ''Ginnungagap'' as signifying a \"magical (and creative) power-filled space\".<ref>De Vries (1977:167); cf. also Dillmann (1998:118-123).</ref>\n\n==Creation myth==\nGinnungagap appears as the primordial void in the Norse [[Creation myth|creation account]]. The ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' states:\n\n{{quote|Ginnungagap, the Yawning Void&nbsp;... which faced toward the northern quarter, became filled with heaviness, and masses of ice and rime, and from within, drizzling rain and gusts; but the southern part of the Yawning Void was lighted by those sparks and glowing masses which flew out of M\u00faspellheim<ref>''The Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson'', translated by [[Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur]], 1916, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_T1cAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA268&dq=Brodeur,+Prose+Edda&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tGVGT96yEonZiAKK6bDbDQ&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=which%20faced%20toward%20the%20northern%20quarter%2C%20became%20filled%20with%20heaviness%2C%20and%20masses%20of%20ice%20and%20rime&f=false p. 17].</ref>}}\n\nIn the northern part of Ginnungagap lay the intense cold of [[Niflheim]], and in the southern part lay the equally intense heat of [[Muspelheim]]. The cosmogonic process began when the effulgence of the two met in the middle of Ginnungagap.\n\n==Geographic rationalization==\n\nScandinavian cartographers from the early 15th century attempted to localise or identify Ginnungagap as a real geographic location from which the creation myth derived. A fragment from a 15th-century (pre-Columbus) Old Norse encyclopedic text entitled ''Gripla'' (Little Compendium) places Ginnungagap between [[Greenland]] and [[Vinland]]:\n\n{{quote|Now is to be told what lies opposite Greenland, out from the bay, which was before named: Furdustrandir hight a land; there are so strong frosts that it is not habitable, so far as one knows; south from thence is Helluland, which is called Skrellingsland; from thence it is not far to Vinland the Good, which some think goes out from Africa; between Vinland and Greenland is Ginnungagap, which flows from the sea called Mare oceanum, and surrounds the whole earth.<ref>''Gripla'', Codex No. 115 translated in ''The Norse Discovery of America'', A.

It is evoked by light which has a [[dominant wavelength]] of roughly 495{{ndash}}570 [[Nanometre|nm]]. In [[subtractive color]] systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and [[cyan]]; in the [[RGB color model]], used on television and computer screens, it is one of the [[additive primary colors]], along with [[red]] and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. By far the largest contributor to green in nature is [[chlorophyll]], the chemical by which plants [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as [[camouflage]]. Several [[minerals]] have a green color, including the [[emerald]], which is colored green by its [[chromium]] content.\n\n<!-- 2nd para \u2013 history and culture -->\nDuring [[Post-classical history|post-classical]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] Europe, green was the color commonly associated with wealth, merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was reserved for the nobility. For this reason, the costume of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and the benches in the British [[House of Commons]] are green while those in the [[House of Lords]] are red.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=98}} It also has a long historical tradition as the color of [[Ireland]] and of [[Gaelic culture]]. It is the historic color of [[Islam]], representing the lush vegetation of [[Paradise]]. It was the color of the banner of [[Muhammad]], and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=94-98}}\n\n<!-- 3rd para \u2013 symbolism and associations-->\nIn surveys made in [[Americas|American]], European, and [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]], green is the color most commonly associated with [[nature]], [[life]], [[health]], [[youth]], [[spring (season)|spring]], [[hope]] and [[envy]].{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=87\u2013104}} In the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]], green is also sometimes associated with [[toxicity]] and poor health,{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=96-97}} but in China and most of Asia, its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=87\u2013104}} Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the [[environmental movement]]. Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the [[Green politics|Green movement]], some naming themselves [[Green party|Green parties]]. This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or [[environmentally friendly]], products. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] permits permanent residence in the United States.\n\n== Etymology and linguistic definitions ==\n[[File:Leavessnipedale.jpg|thumb|right|The word ''green'' has the same Germanic root as the words for ''grass'' and ''grow'']]\n\nThe word ''green'' comes from the [[Middle English]] and [[Old English]] word ''grene'', which, like the German word ''gr\u00fcn'', has the same root as the words ''grass'' and ''grow''.<ref>''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', The World Publishing Company, New York, 1964.</ref>  It is from a [[Common Germanic]] ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/gr\u014dniz|*gronja]]-'', which is also reflected in [[Old Norse]] ''gr\u00e6nn'', [[Old High German]] ''gruoni'' (but unattested in [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]]), ultimately from a [[PIE root]] ''*{{PIE|ghre-}}'' \"to grow\", and root-cognate with ''[[:wikt:grass|grass]]'' and ''[[:wikt:grow|to grow]]''.<ref>{{cite web| last =Harper| first =Douglas| title =Online Etymology Dictionary| date =November 2001| url =http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=green&searchmode=none| accessdate = November 22, 2007}}</ref>\nThe first recorded use of the word as a color term in Old English dates to ca.

In more contemporary terms, they are [[wikt:\u85cd|\u85cd]] (''l\u00e1n'', in Mandarin) and [[wikt:\u7da0|\u7da0]] (''l\u01dc'', in Mandarin) respectively. Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green, [[wikt:\u7dd1|\u7dd1]] (''midori'', which is derived from the classical Japanese descriptive verb ''midoru'' \"to be in leaf, to flourish\" in reference to trees) and \u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3 (''guriin'', which is derived from the English word \"green\"). However, in Japan, although the traffic lights have the same colors as other countries have, the green light is described using the same word as for blue, ''aoi'', because green is considered a shade of aoi; similarly, green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples, green ''[[perilla|shiso]]'' (as opposed to red apples and red shiso) will be described with the word ''aoi''. Vietnamese uses a single word for both blue and green, ''[[wikt:xanh|xanh]]'', with variants such as ''xanh da tr\u1eddi'' (azure, lit. \"sky blue\"), ''lam'' (blue), and ''l\u1ee5c'' (green; also ''xanh l\u00e1 c\u00e2y'', lit. \"leaf green\").\n\n\"Green\" in modern European languages corresponds to about 520\u2013570&nbsp;nm, but many historical and non-European languages make other choices, e.g. using a term for the range of ca. 450\u2013530&nbsp;nm (\"blue/green\") and another for ca. 530\u2013590&nbsp;nm (\"green/yellow\").{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In the comparative study of [[color term]]s in the world's languages, green is only found as a separate category in languages with the fully developed range of six colors (white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue), or more rarely in systems with five colors (white, red, yellow, green, and black/blue).<ref>{{Cite book |title=Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution |first=Brent |last=Berlin |author2=Paul Kay |edition=new, revised  |location=Stanford, Cal. |publisher=CSLI Publications |series=The David Hume Series of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences Reissues |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-57586-162-3 |oclc=807758450 |pages=2\u20133 }}</ref> (See distinction of green from blue)<ref>Newman, Paul and Martha Ratliff (2001).

The process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. It was used by the Romans in the murals of Pompeii, and in Celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century AD. It produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate, but it had drawbacks; it was unstable, it could not resist dampness, it did not mix well with other colors, it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact., and it was toxic. [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in his treatise on painting, warned artists not to use it. It was widely used in miniature paintings in Europe and Persia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its use largely ended in the late 19th century, when it was replaced by the safer and more stable [[chrome green]].{{sfn|Varichon|2000|pp=214\u201315}} Viridian, also called chrome green, is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate, was patented in 1859.

The Romans made a fine green earth pigment that was widely used in the wall paintings of [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]], [[Lyon]], [[Vaison-la-Romaine]], and other Roman cities. They also used the pigment verdigris, made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine.<ref>Anne Vachiron (2000), ''Couleurs \u2013 pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 214.</ref> By the second century AD, the Romans were using green in paintings, mosaics and glass, and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green.{{sfn|Gage|1993|pp=11\u201327}}\n\n=== Postclassical history ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|In the ''[[Arnolfini portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]] (1434), the rich green fabric of the dress showed the wealth and status of the family.\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna 068.jpg|[[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] painted the faces in this painting (1308\u20131311) with an undercoat of green earth pigment.

Red could only be worn by the nobility, brown and gray by peasants, and green by merchants, bankers and the gentry and their families. The [[Mona Lisa]] wears green in her portrait, as does the bride in the Arnolfini portrait by [[Jan van Eyck]].\n\nUnfortunately for those who wanted or were required to wear green, there were no good vegetal green dyes which resisted washing and sunlight. Green dyes were made out of the [[fern]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]], [[buckthorn]] berries, the juice of [[Urtica|nettles]] and of [[leeks]], the [[digitalis]] plant, the [[broom (shrub)|broom]] plant, the leaves of the [[fraxinus]], or ash tree, and the bark of the [[alder]] tree, but they rapidly faded or changed color. Only in the 16th century was a good green dye produced, by first dyeing the cloth blue with woad, and then yellow with ''[[Reseda luteola]]'', also known as yellow-weed.{{sfn|Varichon|2000|p=128}}\n\nThe pigments available to painters were more varied; monks in monasteries used verdigris, made by soaking copper in fermenting wine, to color medieval manuscripts. They also used finely-ground malachite, which made a luminous green. They used green earth colors for backgrounds.\n\nDuring the early Renaissance, painters such as [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] learned to paint faces first with a green undercoat, then with pink, which gave the faces a more realistic hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some of the faces look green.<ref>Pigments Through the Ages, http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/antiquity.html</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\n==== In the 18th and 19th century ====\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Constable DeadhamVale.jpg|''Dedham Vale'' (1802) by [[John Constable]].

Pedro II na abertura da Assembl\u00e9ia Geral.jpg|Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] wearing a dark green velvet mantle\n</gallery>\n\nThe 18th and 19th century brought the discovery and production of synthetic green pigments and dyes, which rapidly replaced the earlier mineral and vegetable pigments and dyes. These new dyes were more stable and brilliant than the vegetable dyes, but some contained high levels of [[arsenic]], and were eventually banned.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th century, green was associated with the [[romantic movement]] in literature and art. The French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] celebrated the virtues of nature, The German poet and philosopher [[Goethe]] declared that green was the most restful color, suitable for decorating bedrooms. Painters such as [[John Constable]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] depicted the lush green of rural landscapes and forests. Green was contrasted to the smoky grays and blacks of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe second half of the 19th century saw the use of green in art to create specific emotions, not just to imitate nature. One of the first to make color the central element of his picture was the American artist [[James McNeil Whistler]], who created a series of paintings called \"symphonies\" or \"noctures\" of color, including ''Symphony in gray and green; The Ocean'' between 1866 and 1872.\n\nThe late nineteenth century also brought the systematic study of color theory, and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other. These studies were avidly followed by artists such as Vincent van Gogh. Describing his painting, The ''Night Cafe'', to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: \"I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens.\"<ref>Vincent van Gogh, ''Corr\u00e9spond\u00e9nce general'', number 533, cited by John Gage, ''Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction''.</ref>\n\n==== In the 20th and 21st century ====\nIn the 1980s green became a political symbol, the color of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party in Germany]] and in many other European countries. It symbolized the [[environmental movement]], and also a new politics of the left which rejected traditional socialism and communism. (See ''Politics'' section below.)\n\n== Symbolism and associations ==\n=== Safety and permission ===\n\n[[File:Feuvert2.jpg|thumb|left|110px|A green light is the universal symbol of permission to go]]\n[[File:John Deere, 9560R.jpg|thumb|left|An agriculture company chooses green and yellow for their products. Three wheels on each hub enables this tractor to work wetter land.]]\n\nGreen can communicate safety to proceed, as in traffic lights.<ref name = OED>Oxford English Dictionary</ref> Green and red were standardized as the colors of international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 in front of the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both [[Health (gaming)|health]] and completed objectives, opposite red.\n\n=== Nature, vivacity, and life ===\nGreen is the color most commonly associated in Europe and the U.S. with nature, vivacity and life.<ref>Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', pp. 90. 47 percent of respondents surveyed associated green with ''nature'' and ''natural'', 18 percent choosing white. 32 percent associated green with ''vivacity'' (20 percent chose yellow), and 40 percent with  ''good health'' (20 percent with red)</ref>\nIt is the color of many environmental organizations, such as [[Greenpeace]], and of the [[Green Parties]] in Europe. Many cities have designated a garden or park as a green space, and use green trash bins and containers. A green cross is commonly used to designate pharmacies in Europe.\n\nIn China, green is associated with the east, with sunrise, and with life and growth.<ref>Yoon, Hong-Key.

Dragons were usually green, because they had the heads, claws and tails of reptiles.\n\nModern [[Chinese dragons]] are also often green, but unlike European dragons, they are benevolent; Chinese dragons traditionally symbolize potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, hurricane, and floods. The dragon is also a symbol of power, strength, and good luck. The Emperor of China usually used the dragon as a symbol of his imperial power and strength. The [[dragon dance]] is a popular feature of Chinese festivals.\n\nIn [[Irish folklore]] and [[English folklore]], the color was sometimes was associated with witchcraft, and with [[faeries]] and spirits.<ref name=evil>Williams, Margaret.

While it is the color most associated by Europeans and Americans with good health, it is also the color most often associated with [[toxicity]] and poison.

From the Middle Ages to the 19th century it was often worn by bankers, merchants country gentlemen and others who were wealthy but not members of the nobility. The benches in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], where the landed gentry sat, are colored green.\n\nIn the United States green was connected with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle the pictures on the front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.<ref>\"Currency Notes\" on the website of the U.S. [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], p. 12.</ref>\n\nOne of the more notable uses of this meaning is found in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.

The crescent and star symbolizes progress and bright future respectively.\n* The Flag of Bangladesh has a green field based on a similar flag used during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971.

While a derivative can be defined on functions of a single variable, for [[function of several variables|functions of several variables]], the gradient takes its place.  The gradient is a [[vector-valued function]], as opposed to a derivative, which is [[Scalar-valued function|scalar-valued]].\n\nLike the derivative, the gradient represents the [[slope]] of the [[tangent]] of the [[graph of a function|graph of the function]]. More precisely, the gradient points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function, and its [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] is the slope of the graph in that direction. The components of the gradient in coordinates are the coefficients of the variables in the equation of the [[tangent space]] to the graph.  This characterizing property of the gradient allows it to be defined independently of a choice of coordinate system, as a [[vector field]] whose components in a coordinate system will transform when going from one coordinate system to another.\n\nThe [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] is the generalization of the gradient for vector-valued functions of several variables and [[differentiable map]]s between [[Euclidean space]]s or, more generally, [[manifold]]s.  A further generalization for a function between [[Banach space]]s is the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]].\n\n==Motivation==\n\n[[File:Gradient of a Function.tif|thumb|350px|Gradient of the 2D function {{math|1=''f''(''x'', ''y'') = ''xe''<sup>\u2212(''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup>)</sup>}} is plotted as blue arrows over the pseudocolor plot of the function.]]\n\nConsider a room in which the temperature is given by a [[scalar field]], {{math|''T''}}, so at each point {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} the temperature is {{math|''T''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}. (Assume that the temperature does not change over time.) At each point in the room, the gradient of {{math|''T''}} at that point will show the direction in which the temperature rises most quickly. The magnitude of the gradient will determine how fast the temperature rises in that direction.\n\nConsider a surface whose height above sea level at point {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} is {{math|''H''(''x'', ''y'')}}. The gradient of {{math|''H''}} at a point is a vector pointing in the direction of the steepest [[slope]] or [[Grade (slope)|grade]] at that point. The steepness of the slope at that point is given by the magnitude of the gradient vector.\n\nThe gradient can also be used to measure how a scalar field changes in other directions, rather than just the direction of greatest change, by taking a [[dot product]]. Suppose that the steepest slope on a hill is 40%. If a road goes directly up the hill, then the steepest slope on the road will also be 40%. If, instead, the road goes around the hill at an angle, then it will have a shallower slope. For example, if the angle between the road and the uphill direction, projected onto the horizontal plane, is 60\u00b0, then the steepest slope along the road will be 20%, which is 40% times the [[cosine]] of 60\u00b0.\n\nThis observation can be mathematically stated as follows. If the hill height function {{math|''H''}} is [[differentiable function|differentiable]], then the gradient of {{math|''H''}} [[dot product|dotted]] with a [[unit vector]] gives the slope of the hill in the direction of the vector. More precisely, when {{math|''H''}} is differentiable, the dot product of the gradient of {{math|''H''}} with a given unit vector is equal to the [[directional derivative]] of {{math|''H''}} in the direction of that unit vector.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:3d-gradient-cos.svg|thumb|350px|The gradient of the function {{math|''f''(''x'',''y'') {{=}} \u2212(cos<sup>2</sup>''x'' + cos<sup>2</sup>''y'')<sup>2</sup>}} depicted as a projected vector field on the bottom plane.]]\n\nThe gradient (or gradient vector field) of a scalar function {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>'')}} is denoted {{math|\u2207''f''}} or {{math|{{vec|\u2207}}''f''}}  where {{math|\u2207}} (the [[nabla symbol]]) denotes the vector [[differential operator]], [[del]]. The notation {{math|grad ''f''}} is also commonly used for the gradient. The gradient of {{math|''f''}} is defined as the unique [[vector field]] whose [[dot product]] with any unit [[Euclidean vector|vector]] {{math|'''v'''}} at each point {{math|''x''}} is the [[directional derivative]] of {{math|''f''}} along {{math|'''v'''}}. That is,\n\n:<math>\\big(\\nabla f(x)\\big)\\cdot \\mathbf{v} = D_{\\mathbf v}f(x).</math>\n\nWhen a function also depends on a parameter such as time, the gradient often refers simply to the vector of its spatial derivatives only (see [[Spatial gradient]]).\n\n===Cartesian coordinates===\nIn the three-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]] with a [[Euclidean metric]], the gradient, if it exists, is given by:\n\n:<math>\\nabla f = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\mathbf{i} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\mathbf{j} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\mathbf{k},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''i'''}}, {{math|'''j'''}}, {{math|'''k'''}} are the [[standard basis|standard]] [[unit vector]]s in the directions of the {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} coordinates, respectively. For example, the gradient of the function\n:<math>f(x,y,z)= 2x+3y^2-\\sin(z)</math>\nis\n:<math>\\nabla f = 2\\mathbf{i}+ 6y\\mathbf{j} -\\cos(z)\\mathbf{k}.</math>\n\nIn some applications it is customary to represent the gradient as a [[row vector]] or [[column vector]] of its components in a rectangular coordinate system.\n\n===Cylindrical and spherical coordinates===\n{{main|Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates}}\n\nIn [[cylindrical coordinate system#Definition|cylindrical coordinates]] with a Euclidean metric, the gradient is given by:<ref name=\"Schey-1992\">{{harvnb|Schey|1992|pp=139\u2013142}}.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\nabla f(\\rho, \\varphi, z) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\rho}\\mathbf{e}_\\rho + \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\varphi}\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\mathbf{e}_z,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c1''}} is the axial distance, {{math|''\u03c6''}} is the azimuthal or azimuth angle, {{math|''z''}} is the axial coordinate, and {{math|'''e'''<sub>''\u03c1''</sub>}}, {{math|'''e'''<sub>''\u03c6''</sub>}} and {{math|'''e'''<sub>''z''</sub>}} are unit vectors pointing along the coordinate directions.\n\nIn [[spherical coordinate system#Definition|spherical coordinates]], the gradient is given by:<ref name=\"Schey-1992\" />\n\n:<math>\\nabla f(r, \\theta, \\varphi) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}\\mathbf{e}_r + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta}\\mathbf{e}_\\theta + \\frac{1}{r \\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\varphi}\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''r''}} is the radial distance, {{math|''\u03c6''}} is the azimuthal angle and {{math|''\u03b8''}} is the polar angle, and {{math|'''e'''<sub>''r''</sub>}}, {{math|'''e'''<sub>''\u03b8''</sub>}} and {{math|'''e'''<sub>''\u03c6''</sub>}} are again local unit vectors pointing in the coordinate directions (i.e. the normalized  [[Curvilinear coordinates#Covariant and contravariant bases|covariant basis]]).\n\nFor the gradient in other [[orthogonal coordinate system]]s, see [[Orthogonal coordinates#Differential operators in three dimensions|Orthogonal coordinates (Differential operators in three dimensions)]].\n\n===General coordinates===\nUsing [[Einstein notation]] we can consider the gradient in  [[Curvilinear coordinates|general coordinates]], which we write as {{math|''x''<sup>1</sup>, ..., ''x''<sup>''i''</sup>, ..., ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of dimensions of the domain. Here, the upper index refers to the number of the coordinate or component, so {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup>}} refers to the second component, and not the quantity {{math|''x''}} squared. The index variable {{math|''i''}} is used to refer to an arbitrary element, such as {{math|''x''<sup>''i''</sup>}}. The gradient can then be written as:\n\n:<math>\\nabla f = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}\\mathbf{e}^i =  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}g^{ij} \\mathbf{e}_j,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{e}^i</math> and <math>\\mathbf{e}_j = \\partial \\mathbf{x}/\\partial x^j</math> refer to the '''unnormalized''' local  [[Curvilinear coordinates#Covariant and contravariant bases|contravariant and covariant bases]] respectively, <math>g^{ij}</math> is the inverse [[metric tensor]], and the Einstein summation convention implies summation over ''i''  and ''j''.

The approximation is as follows:\n\n:<math>f(x) \\approx f(x_0) + (\\nabla f)_{x_0}\\cdot(x-x_0)</math>\n\nfor {{math|''x''}} close to {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, where {{math|(\u2207''f''&thinsp;)<sub>''x''<sub>0</sub></sub>}} is the gradient of {{math|''f''}} computed at {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, and the dot denotes the [[dot product]] on {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. This equation is equivalent to the first two terms in the [[Taylor series#Taylor series in several variables|multivariable Taylor series]] expansion of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}.\n\n===Differential or (exterior) derivative===\nThe best linear approximation to a differentiable function\n:<math>f \\colon \\mathbf{R}^n \\to \\mathbf{R}</math>\nat a point {{math|''x''}} in {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is a linear map from {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} to {{math|'''R'''}} which is often denoted by {{math|''df<sub>x</sub>''}} or {{math|''Df''(''x'')}} and called the '''[[differential (calculus)|differential]]''' or [[total derivative|('''total''') '''derivative''']] of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''}}. The gradient is therefore related to the differential by the formula\n:<math>(\\nabla f)_x\\cdot v = df_x(v)</math>\nfor any {{math|''v'' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. The function {{math|''df''}}, which maps {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''df''<sub>''x''</sub>}}, is called the differential or [[exterior derivative]] of {{math|''f''}} and is an example of a [[differential 1-form]].\n\nIf {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is viewed as the space of (dimension {{math|''n''}}) column vectors (of real numbers), then one can regard {{math|''df''}} as the row vector with components\n:<math>\\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}\\right),</math>\nso that {{math|''df''<sub>''x''</sub>(''v'')}} is given by matrix multiplication.  Assuming the standard Euclidean metric on {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, the gradient is then the corresponding column vector, i.e.,\n:<math>(\\nabla f)_i = df^\\mathsf{T}_i.</math>\n\n===Gradient as a derivative===\nLet {{math|''U''}} be an [[open set]] in {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. If the function {{math|''f'' : ''U'' \u2192 '''R'''}} is [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative|differentiable]], then the differential of {{math|''f''}} is the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative|(Fr\u00e9chet) derivative]] of {{math|''f''}}. Thus {{math|\u2207''f''}} is a function from {{math|''U''}} to the space {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{\\|f(x+h)-f(x) -\\nabla f(x)\\cdot h\\|}{\\|h\\|} = 0,</math>\nwhere \u00b7 is the dot product.\n\nAs a consequence, the usual properties of the derivative hold for the gradient:\n\n====[[Linearity]]====\nThe gradient is linear in the sense that if {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are two real-valued functions differentiable at the point {{math|''a'' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, and {{mvar|\u03b1}} and {{mvar|\u03b2}} are two constants, then {{math|''\u03b1f'' + ''\u03b2g''}} is differentiable at {{math|''a''}}, and moreover\n:<math>\\nabla\\left(\\alpha f+\\beta g\\right)(a) = \\alpha \\nabla f(a) + \\beta\\nabla g (a).</math>\n\n====[[Product rule]]====\nIf {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are real-valued functions differentiable at a point {{math|''a'' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, then the product rule asserts that the product {{math|''fg''}} is differentiable at {{math|''a''}}, and\n:<math>\\nabla (fg)(a) = f(a)\\nabla g(a) + g(a)\\nabla f(a).</math>\n\n====[[Chain rule]]====\nSuppose that {{math|''f'' : ''A'' \u2192 '''R'''}} is a real-valued function defined on a subset {{math|''A''}} of {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, and that {{math|''f''}} is differentiable at a point {{math|''a''}}. There are two forms of the chain rule applying to the gradient. First, suppose that the function {{math|''g''}} is a [[parametric curve]]; that is, a function {{math|''g'' : ''I'' \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} maps a subset {{math|''I'' \u2282 '''R'''}} into {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. If {{math|''g''}} is differentiable at a point {{math|''c'' \u2208 ''I''}} such that {{math|''g''(''c'') {{=}} ''a''}}, then\n:<math>(f\\circ g)'(c) = \\nabla f(a)\\cdot g'(c),</math>\nwhere \u2218 is the [[composition operator]]: {{math|(&thinsp;''f''\u2009\u2218\u2009''g'')(''x'') {{=}} ''f''(''g''(''x''))}}.\n\nMore generally, if instead {{math|''I'' \u2282 '''R'''<sup>''k''</sup>}}, then the following holds:\n:<math>\\nabla (f\\circ g)(c) = \\big(Dg(c)\\big)^\\mathsf{T} \\big(\\nabla f(a)\\big),</math>\nwhere {{math|(''Dg'')}}<sup>T</sup> denotes the transpose [[Jacobian matrix]].\n\nFor the second form of the chain rule, suppose that {{math|''h'' : ''I'' \u2192 '''R'''}} is a real valued function on a subset {{math|''I''}} of {{math|'''R'''}}, and that {{math|''h''}} is differentiable at the point {{math|''f''(''a'') \u2208 ''I''}}. Then\n:<math>\\nabla (h\\circ f)(a) = h'\\big(f(a)\\big)\\nabla f(a).</math>\n\n==Further properties and applications==\n\n===Level sets===\n{{see also|Level set#Level sets versus the gradient}}\nA level surface, or [[isosurface]], is the set of all points where some function has a given value.\n\nIf {{math|''f''}} is differentiable, then the [[dot product]] {{math|(\u2207''f''&thinsp;)<sub>''x''</sub> \u22c5 ''v''}} of the gradient at a point {{math|''x''}} with a vector {{math|''v''}} gives the [[directional derivative]] of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''}} in the direction {{math|''v''}}. It follows that in this case the gradient of {{math|''f''}} is [[orthogonal]] to the [[level set]]s of {{math|''f''}}. For example, a level surface in three-dimensional space is defined by an equation of the form {{math|1=''F''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = ''c''}}. The gradient of {{math|''F''}} is then normal to the surface.\n\nMore generally, any [[embedded submanifold|embedded]] [[hypersurface]] in a Riemannian manifold can be cut out by an equation of the form {{math|1=''F''(''P'') = 0}} such that {{math|''dF''}} is nowhere zero. The gradient of {{math|''F''}} is then normal to the hypersurface.\n\nSimilarly, an [[affine algebraic variety|affine algebraic hypersurface]] may be defined by an equation {{math|1=''F''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) = 0}}, where {{math|''F''}} is a polynomial. The gradient of {{math|''F''}} is zero at a singular point of the hypersurface (this is the definition of a singular point). At a non-singular point, it is a nonzero normal vector.\n\n===Conservative vector fields and the gradient theorem===\n{{main|Gradient theorem}}\n\nThe gradient of a function is called a gradient field. A (continuous) gradient field is always a [[conservative vector field]]: its [[line integral]] along any path depends only on the endpoints of the path, and can be evaluated by the [[gradient theorem]] (the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals). Conversely, a (continuous) conservative vector field is always the gradient of a function.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Gradient of a vector===\n{{see also|Covariant derivative}}\nSince the total derivative of a vector field is a [[linear mapping]] from vectors to vectors, it is a [[tensor]] quantity.\n\nIn rectangular coordinates, the gradient of a [[vector field]] {{math|1='''f''' = (&thinsp;''f''{{i sup|1}}, ''f''{{i sup|2}}, ''f''{{i sup|3}})}} is defined by:\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\mathbf{f}=g^{jk}\\frac{\\partial f^i}{\\partial x^j} \\mathbf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_k,</math>\n\nwhere the [[Einstein summation notation]] is used and the [[tensor product]] of the vectors {{math|'''e'''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|'''e'''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is a [[dyadic tensor]] of type (2,0), or the transpose of the [[Jacobian matrix]]\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f^i}{\\partial x^j} = \\frac{\\partial (f^1,f^2,f^3)}{\\partial (x^1,x^2,x^3)}.</math>\n\nIn curvilinear coordinates, or more generally on a curved [[Riemannian manifold|manifold]], the gradient involves [[Christoffel symbols]]:\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\mathbf{f}=g^{jk}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f^i}{\\partial x^j}+{\\Gamma^i}_{jl}f^l\\right) \\mathbf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_k,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''g''{{i sup|''jk''}}}} are the components of the inverse [[metric tensor]] and the {{math|'''e'''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are the coordinate basis vectors.\n\nExpressed more invariantly, the gradient of a vector field {{math|'''f'''}} can be defined by the [[Levi-Civita connection]] and metric tensor:<ref>{{harvnb|Dubrovin|Fomenko|Novikov|1991|pages=348\u2013349}}.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\nabla^a f^b = g^{ac} \\nabla_c f^b ,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|\u2207<sub>''c''</sub>}} is the connection.\n===Riemannian manifolds===\nFor any smooth function {{mvar|f}} on a [[Riemannian manifold]] {{math|(''M'', ''g'')}}, the gradient of {{math|''f''}} is the [[vector field]] {{math|\u2207''f''}} such that for any vector field {{math|''X''}},\n:<math>g(\\nabla f, X) = \\partial_X f,</math>\ni.e.,\n:<math>g_x\\big((\\nabla f)_x, X_x \\big) = (\\partial_X f) (x),</math>\nwhere {{math|''g''<sub>''x''</sub>( , )}} denotes the [[inner product]] of tangent vectors at {{math|''x''}} defined by the metric {{math|''g''}} and {{math|\u2202<sub>''X''</sub>&thinsp;''f''}} is the function that takes any point {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''M''}} to the [[directional derivative]] of {{math|''f''}} in the direction {{math|''X''}}, evaluated at {{math|''x''}}. In other words, in a [[coordinate chart]] {{math|''\u03c6''}} from an open subset of {{math|''M''}} to an open subset of {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, {{math|(\u2202<sub>''X''</sub>&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)(''x'')}} is given by:\n:<math>\\sum_{j=1}^n X^{j} \\big(\\varphi(x)\\big) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{j}}(f \\circ \\varphi^{-1}) \\Bigg|_{\\varphi(x)},</math>\nwhere {{math|''X''{{isup|''j''}}}} denotes the {{math|''j''}}th component of {{math|''X''}} in this coordinate chart.\n\nSo, the local form of the gradient takes the form:\n\n:<math>\\nabla f = g^{ik} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^k} {\\textbf e}_i .</math>\n\nGeneralizing the case {{math|1=''M'' = '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, the gradient of a function is related to its [[exterior derivative]], since\n:<math>(\\partial_X f) (x) = (df)_x(X_x) .</math>\nMore precisely, the gradient {{math|\u2207''f''}} is the vector field associated to the differential 1-form {{math|''df''}} using the [[musical isomorphism]]\n:<math>\\sharp=\\sharp^g\\colon T^*M\\to TM</math>\n(called \"sharp\") defined by the metric {{math|''g''}}. The relation between the exterior derivative and the gradient of a function on {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is a special case of this in which the metric is the flat metric given by the dot product.\n==See also==\n* [[Curl (mathematics)|Curl]]\n* [[Del]]\n* [[Divergence]]\n* [[Four-gradient]]\n* [[Gradient theorem]]\n* [[Graph of a function]]\n* [[Hessian matrix]]\n* [[Skew gradient]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book\n | first1 = Theresa M.\n | last1 = Korn\n | first2 = Granino Arthur\n | last2 = Korn\n | title = Mathematical Handbook for Scientists and Engineers: Definitions, Theorems, and Formulas for Reference and Review\n | publisher = Dover Publications\n | year = 2000\n | pages = 157\u2013160\n | isbn = 0-486-41147-8\n | oclc = 43864234\n | ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | first = H.

The ice of a ''polar glacier'' is always below the freezing point from the surface to its base, although the surface snowpack may experience seasonal melting. A ''sub-polar glacier'' includes both temperate and polar ice, depending on depth beneath the surface and position along the length of the glacier. In a similar way, the thermal regime of a glacier is often described by its basal temperature. A ''cold-based glacier'' is below freezing at the ice-ground interface, and is thus frozen to the underlying substrate. A ''warm-based glacier'' is above or at freezing at the interface, and is able to slide at this contact.<ref name=\"ColdBased\">{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-90-481-2642-2_72|title=Encyclopedia of Snow, Ice and Glaciers|first1=Reginald D.|last1=Lorrain|first2=Sean J.|last2=Fitzsimons|editor-first1=Vijay P.|editor-last1=Singh|editor-first2=Pratap|editor-last2=Singh|editor-first3=Umesh K.|editor-last3=Haritashya|date=18 October 2017|publisher=Springer Netherlands|pages=157\u2013161|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2642-2_72/fulltext.html}}</ref> This contrast is thought to a large extent to govern the ability of a glacier to effectively [[Glacial erosion|erode its bed]], as sliding ice promotes [[Plucking (glaciation)|plucking]] at rock from the surface below.<ref>Boulton, G.S.

A glacier usually originates from a landform called '[[cirque]]' (or corrie or cwm) \u2013 a typically armchair-shaped geological feature (such as a depression between mountains enclosed by ar\u00eates) \u2013 which collects and compresses through gravity the snow that falls into it. This snow collects and is compacted by the weight of the snow falling above it, forming [[n\u00e9v\u00e9]]. Further crushing of the individual snowflakes and squeezing the air from the snow turns it into \"glacial ice\". This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it \"overflows\" through a geological weakness or vacancy, such as the gap between two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure.  On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft) of snow-ice.\n\n[[File:Packrafting at Spencer Glacier. Chugach National Forest, Alaska.jpg|thumb|left|A [[packraft]]er passes a wall of freshly exposed blue ice on Spencer Glacier, in Alaska. Glacial ice acts like a filter on light, and the more time light can spend traveling through ice, the bluer it becomes.]]\nIn temperate glaciers, snow repeatedly freezes and thaws, changing into granular ice called [[firn]]. Under the pressure of the layers of ice and snow above it, this granular ice fuses into denser and denser [[firn]]. Over a period of years, layers of firn undergo further compaction and become glacial ice. Glacier ice is slightly less dense than ice formed from frozen water because it contains tiny trapped air bubbles.\n\nGlacial ice has a distinctive [[blue]] tint because it absorbs some red light due to an [[overtone]] of the infrared [[Infrared spectroscopy|OH stretching]] mode of the water molecule. Liquid [[water]] is blue for the same reason. The blue of glacier ice is sometimes misattributed to [[Rayleigh scattering]] due to bubbles in the ice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/5C.html |title=What causes the blue color that sometimes appears in snow and ice? |publisher=Webexhibits.org |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:153 - Glacier Perito Moreno - Grotte glaciaire - Janvier 2010.jpg|thumb|A [[glacier cave]] located on the [[Perito Moreno Glacier]] in Argentina]]\n\n==Structure==\nA glacier originates at a location called its glacier head and terminates at its glacier foot, snout, or [[Glacier terminus|terminus]].\n\nGlaciers are broken into zones based on surface snowpack and melt conditions.<ref>Benson, C.S., 1961, \"Stratigraphic studies in the snow and firn of the Greenland Ice Sheet\", ''Res. Rep. 70'', U.S. Army Snow, Ice and Permafrost Res Establ., Corps of Eng., 120 pp.</ref>  The ablation zone is the region where there is a net loss in glacier mass. The equilibrium line separates the ablation zone and the [[accumulation zone]]; it is the altitude where the amount of new snow gained by accumulation is equal to the amount of ice lost through ablation.  The upper part of a glacier, where accumulation exceeds ablation, is called the [[accumulation zone]]. In general, the accumulation zone accounts for 60\u201370% of the glacier's surface area, more if the glacier calves icebergs. Ice in the accumulation zone is deep enough to exert a downward force that erodes underlying rock.  After a glacier melts, it often leaves behind a bowl- or amphitheater-shaped depression that ranges in size from large basins like the Great Lakes to smaller mountain depressions known as [[cirque]]s.\n\nThe accumulation zone can be subdivided based on its melt conditions.\n# The dry snow zone is a region where no melt occurs, even in the summer, and the snowpack remains dry.\n# The percolation zone is an area with some surface melt, causing [[meltwater]] to percolate into the [[snow#Snowpack|snowpack]].  This zone is often marked by refrozen [[Ice segregation|ice lens]]es, glands, and layers.  The snowpack also never reaches melting point.\n# Near the equilibrium line on some glaciers, a superimposed ice zone develops.  This zone is where meltwater refreezes as a cold layer in the glacier, forming a continuous mass of ice.\n# The wet snow zone is the region where all of the snow deposited since the end of the previous summer has been raised to 0&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nThe health of a glacier is usually assessed by determining the [[glacier mass balance]] or observing terminus behavior. Healthy glaciers have large accumulation zones, more than 60% of their area snowcovered at the end of the melt season, and a terminus with vigorous flow.\n\nFollowing the [[Little Ice Age]]'s end around 1850, [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glaciers around the Earth have retreated substantially]]. A slight cooling led to the advance of many alpine glaciers between 1950 and 1985, but since 1985 glacier retreat and mass loss has become larger and increasingly ubiquitous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grid.unep.ch/activities/global_change/switzerland.php |title=Glacier change and related hazards in Switzerland |publisher=UNEP |accessdate=2009-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://folk.uio.no/kaeaeb/publications/grl04_paul.pdf |format=PDF| title= Rapid disintegration of Alpine glaciers observed with satellite data|doi=10.1029/2004GL020816 |year= 2004 |bibcode=2004GeoRL..3121402P |volume=31 |journal=Geophysical Research Letters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/Glacier/glacier_retreat.htm |title=Recent Global Glacier Retreat Overview |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>\n\n==Motion==\n[[File:Chevron Crevasses 00.JPG|thumb|Shear or herring-bone crevasses on [[Emmons Glacier]] ([[Mount Rainier]]); such crevasses often form near the edge of a glacier where interactions with underlying or marginal rock impede flow.

The pressure on ice deeper than 50&nbsp;m causes [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic flow]]. At the molecular level, ice consists of stacked layers of molecules with relatively weak bonds between layers. When the stress on the layer above exceeds the inter-layer binding strength, it moves faster than the layer below.<ref>W.S.B. Paterson, Physics of ice</ref>\n\nGlaciers also move through [[basal sliding]]. In this process, a glacier slides over the terrain on which it sits, [[lubrication|lubricated]] by the presence of liquid water.  The water is created from ice that melts under high pressure from frictional heating.  Basal sliding is dominant in temperate, or warm-based glaciers.\n\nAlthough evidence in favour of glacial flow was known by the early 19th century, other theories of glacial motion were advanced, such as the idea that melt water, refreezing inside glaciers, caused the glacier to dilate and extend its length. As it became clear that glaciers behaved to some degree as if the ice were a viscous fluid, it was argued that \"regelation\", or the melting and refreezing of ice at a temperature lowered by the pressure on the ice inside the glacier, was what allowed the ice to deform and flow.  [[James David Forbes|James Forbes]] came up with the essentially correct explanation in the 1840s, although it was several decades before it was fully accepted.<ref>{{cite journal| title= A short history of scientific investigations on glaciers|year= 1987 |volume=Special issue |journal=Journal of Glaciology|pages= 4\u20135|author=Clarke, Garry K.C.}}</ref>\n[[File:Pexels-photo-25416.jpg|thumb|Perito Moreno glacier]]\n\n===Fracture zone and cracks===\n[[File:TitlisIceCracks.jpg|thumb|Ice cracks in the [[Titlis]] Glacier]]\nThe top {{convert|50|m|abbr=on}} of a glacier are rigid because they are under low pressure. This upper section is known as the ''fracture zone'' and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section. When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called [[crevasse]]s develop in the fracture zone.  Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity.  If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, [[Shear (geology)|shear]] forces cause them to break apart, opening  a crevasse.  Crevasses are seldom more than {{convert|150|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} deep but in some cases can be {{convert|1000|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} or even deeper. Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form.  Intersecting crevasses can create isolated peaks in the ice, called [[serac]]s.\n\nCrevasses can form in several different ways.  Transverse crevasses are transverse to flow and form where steeper slopes cause a glacier to accelerate.  Longitudinal crevasses form semi-parallel to flow where a glacier expands laterally.  Marginal crevasses form from the edge of the glacier, due to the reduction in speed caused by friction of the valley walls.  Marginal crevasses are usually largely transverse to flow.  Moving glacier ice can sometimes separate from stagnant ice above, forming a [[bergschrund]].  Bergschrunds resemble crevasses but are singular features at a glacier's margins.\n\nCrevasses make travel over glaciers hazardous, especially when they are hidden by fragile [[snow bridge]]s.\n\n[[File:Glaciereaston.jpg|thumb|upright|Crossing a crevasse on the [[Easton Glacier]], [[Mount Baker]], in the [[North Cascades]], United States]]\n\nBelow the equilibrium line, glacial meltwater is concentrated in stream channels.  Meltwater can pool in proglacial lakes on top of a glacier or descend into the depths of a glacier via [[Moulin (geomorphology)|moulins]]. Streams within or beneath a glacier flow in englacial or sub-glacial tunnels.  These tunnels sometimes reemerge at the glacier's surface.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/moulin-20061211.html |title=Moulin 'Blanc': NASA Expedition Probes Deep Within a Greenland Glacier |publisher=NASA |date=2006-12-11 |accessdate=2009-01-05}}</ref>\n\n===Speed===\nThe speed of glacial displacement is partly determined by [[friction]].

Glaciers can be found in all [[latitude]]s except from 20\u00b0 to 27\u00b0 north and south of the equator where the presence of the descending limb of the [[Hadley circulation]] lowers precipitation so much that with high [[insolation]] [[snow line]]s reach above {{convert|6500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. Between 19\u02daN and 19\u02daS, however, precipitation is higher and the mountains above {{convert|5000|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} usually have permanent snow.\n\nEven at high latitudes, glacier formation is not inevitable.  Areas of the [[Arctic]], such as [[Banks Island]], and the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] in Antarctica are considered [[polar desert]]s where glaciers cannot form because they receive little snowfall despite the bitter cold.  Cold air, unlike warm air, is unable to transport much water vapor.

This is because these peaks are located near or in the [[hyperarid]] [[Atacama Desert]].\n\n== Glacial geology ==\n[[File:Arranque glaciar-en.svg|thumb|Diagram of glacial plucking and abrasion]]\n[[File:PluckedGraniteAlandIslands.JPG|thumb|right|Glacially plucked granitic bedrock near Mariehamn, [[\u00c5land Islands]]]]\nGlaciers erode terrain through two principal processes: '''[[abrasion (geology)|abrasion]]''' and '''[[Plucking (glaciation)|plucking]].\n\nAs glaciers flow over bedrock, they soften and lift blocks of rock into the ice. This process, called plucking, is caused by subglacial water that penetrates fractures in the bedrock and subsequently freezes and expands. This expansion causes the ice to act as a lever that loosens the rock by lifting it. Thus, sediments of all sizes become part of the glacier's load. If a retreating glacier gains enough debris, it may become a [[rock glacier]], like the [[Timpanogos Glacier]] in Utah.\n\nAbrasion occurs when the ice and its load of rock fragments slide over bedrock and function as sandpaper, smoothing and polishing the bedrock below.  The pulverized rock this process produces is called [[rock flour]] and is made up of rock grains  between 0.002 and 0.00625&nbsp;mm in size.  Abrasion leads to steeper valley walls and mountain slopes in alpine settings, which can cause avalanches and rock slides, which add even more material to the glacier.\n\nGlacial abrasion is commonly characterized by [[glacial striation]]s.  Glaciers produce these when they contain large boulders that carve long scratches in the bedrock.  By [[cartography|mapping]] the direction of the striations, researchers can determine the direction of the glacier's movement.  Similar to striations are [[chatter mark]]s, lines of crescent-shape depressions in the rock underlying a glacier.  They are formed by abrasion when boulders in the glacier are repeatedly caught and released as they are dragged along the bedrock.\n\nThe rate of glacier erosion varies. Six factors control erosion rate:\n* Velocity of glacial movement\n* Thickness of the ice\n* Shape, abundance and hardness of rock fragments contained in the ice at the bottom of the glacier\n* Relative ease of erosion of the surface under the glacier\n* Thermal conditions at the glacier base\n* Permeability and water pressure at the glacier base\nWhen the bedrock has frequent fractures on the surface, glacial erosion rates tend to increase as plucking is the main erosive force on the surface; when the bedrock has wide gaps between sporadic fractures, however, abrasion tends to be the dominant erosive form and glacial erosion rates become slow.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=D\u00fchnforth|first=Miriam|last2=Anderson|first2=Robert S.|last3=Ward|first3=Dylan|last4=Stock|first4=Greg M.|date=2010-05-01|title=Bedrock fracture control of glacial erosion processes and rates|url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/38/5/423|journal=Geology|language=en|volume=38|issue=5|pages=423\u2013426|doi=10.1130/G30576.1|issn=0091-7613|bibcode=2010Geo....38..423D}}</ref>\n\nGlaciers in lower latitudes tend to be much more erosive than glaciers in higher latitudes, because they have more meltwater reaching the glacial base and facilitate sediment production and transport under the same moving speed and amount of ice.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koppes|first=Mich\u00e9le|last2=Hallet|first2=Bernard|last3=Rignot|first3=Eric|last4=Mouginot|first4=J\u00e9r\u00e9mie|last5=Wellner|first5=Julia Smith|last6=Boldt|first6=Katherine|title=Observed latitudinal variations in erosion as a function of glacier dynamics|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature15385|journal=Nature|volume=526|issue=7571|pages=100\u2013103|doi=10.1038/nature15385|bibcode=2015Natur.526..100K}}</ref>\n\nMaterial that becomes incorporated in a glacier is typically carried as far as the [[zone of ablation]] before being deposited. Glacial deposits are of two distinct types:\n* ''Glacial till'': material directly deposited from glacial ice. Till includes a mixture of undifferentiated material ranging from clay size to boulders, the usual composition of a moraine.\n* ''Fluvial and outwash sediments'': sediments deposited by water. These deposits are stratified by size.\n\nLarger pieces of rock that are encrusted in till or deposited on the surface are called \"[[glacial erratic]]s\".  They range in size from pebbles to boulders, but as they are often moved great distances, they may be drastically different from the material upon which they are found.  Patterns of glacial erratics hint at past glacial motions.\n\n===Moraines===\n[[File:MorainesLakeLouise.JPG|thumb|Glacial moraines above [[Lake Louise (Alberta)|Lake Louise]], [[Alberta]], Canada]]\nGlacial [[moraine]]s are formed by the deposition of material from a glacier and are exposed after the glacier has retreated.  They usually appear as linear mounds of [[till]], a non-sorted mixture of rock, gravel and boulders within a matrix of a fine powdery material. Terminal or end moraines are formed at the foot or terminal end of a glacier. Lateral moraines are formed on the sides of the glacier. Medial moraines are formed when two different glaciers merge and the lateral moraines of each coalesce to form a moraine in the middle of the combined glacier. Less apparent are [[ground moraine]]s, also called ''glacial drift'', which often blankets the surface underneath the glacier downslope from the equilibrium line.\n\nThe term ''moraine'' is of French origin.  It was coined by peasants to describe alluvial embankments and rims found near the margins of glaciers in the French [[Alps]]. In modern geology, the term is used more broadly, and is applied to a series of formations, all of which are composed of till. Moraines can also create moraine dammed lakes.\n\n=== Drumlins ===\n[[File:Drumlins LMB.svg|frame|right|A drumlin field forms after a glacier has modified the landscape. The teardrop-shaped formations denote the direction of the ice flow.]]\n[[Drumlin]]s are asymmetrical, canoe shaped hills made mainly of till. Their heights vary from 15 to 50&nbsp;meters and they can reach a kilometer in length. The steepest side of the hill faces the direction from which the ice advanced (''stoss''), while a longer slope is left in the ice's direction of movement (''lee'').\n\nDrumlins are found in groups called ''[[drumlin field]]s'' or ''drumlin camps''. One of these fields is found east of [[Rochester, New York]]; it is estimated to contain about 10,000 drumlins.\n\nAlthough the process that forms drumlins is not fully understood, their shape implies that they are products of the plastic deformation zone of ancient glaciers. It is believed that many drumlins were formed when glaciers advanced over and altered the deposits of earlier glaciers.\n\n==={{anchor|Glacial valleys}}Glacial valleys, cirques, ar\u00eates, and pyramidal peaks===\n[[File:Glacial landscape.svg|right|thumb|Features of a glacial landscape]]\n\nBefore glaciation, mountain valleys have a characteristic [[V-shaped valley|\"V\" shape]], produced by eroding water. During glaciation, these valleys are often widened, deepened and smoothed to form a [[U-shaped valley|\"U\"-shaped]] glacial valley or glacial trough, as it is sometimes called.<ref>[https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/gallery/troughs.html] Glacial Landforms: Trough</ref>  The erosion that creates glacial valleys truncates any spurs of rock or earth that may have earlier extended across the valley, creating broadly triangular-shaped cliffs called [[truncated spurs]].  Within glacial valleys, depressions created by plucking and abrasion can be filled by lakes, called [[paternoster lake]]s.  If a glacial valley runs into a large body of water, it forms a [[fjord]].\n\nTypically glaciers deepen their valleys more than their smaller [[tributary|tributaries]]. Therefore, when glaciers recede, the valleys of the tributary glaciers remain above the main glacier's depression and are called [[hanging valley]]s.\n\nAt the start of a classic valley glacier is a bowl-shaped [[cirque]], which has escarped walls on three sides but is open on the side that descends into the valley. Cirques are where ice begins to accumulate in a glacier.  Two glacial cirques may form back to back and erode their backwalls until only a narrow ridge, called an [[ar\u00eate]] is left. This structure may result in a [[mountain pass]].  If multiple cirques encircle a single mountain, they create pointed [[pyramidal peak]]s; particularly steep examples are called [[Glacial horn|horn]]s.\n\n===Roches moutonn\u00e9es===\nPassage of glacial ice over an area of bedrock may cause the rock to be sculpted into a knoll called a ''[[roche moutonn\u00e9e]],'' or \"sheepback\" rock. Roches moutonn\u00e9es may be elongated, rounded and asymmetrical in shape. They range in length from less than a meter to several hundred meters long.<ref>'Glaciers & Glaciation' (Arnold, London 1998) Douglas Benn and David Evans, pp324-326</ref>  Roches moutonn\u00e9es have a gentle slope on their up-glacier sides and a steep to vertical face on their down-glacier sides. The glacier abrades the smooth slope on the upstream side as it flows along, but tears rock fragments loose and carries them away from the downstream side via [[plucking (glaciation)|plucking]].\n\n===Alluvial stratification===\nAs the water that rises from the [[ablation zone]] moves away from the glacier, it carries fine eroded sediments with it.  As the speed of the water decreases, so does its capacity to carry objects in suspension. The water thus gradually deposits the sediment as it runs, creating an [[alluvial plain]]. When this phenomenon occurs in a valley, it is called a ''valley train''. When the deposition is in an [[estuary]], the sediments are known as [[bay mud]].\n\nOutwash plains and valley trains are usually accompanied by basins known as \"[[Kettle (landform)|kettles]]\". These are small lakes formed when large ice blocks that are trapped in alluvium melt and produce water-filled depressions. Kettle diameters range from 5&nbsp;m to 13&nbsp;km, with depths of up to 45&nbsp;meters.  Most are circular in shape because the blocks of ice that formed them were rounded as they melted.<ref name=britannica>{{cite web | title =Kettle geology |publisher=Britannica Online | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/315739/kettle | accessdate = 2009-03-12}}</ref>\n\n===Glacial deposits===\n[[File:Receding glacier-en.svg|thumb|Landscape produced by a receding glacier]]\nWhen a glacier's size shrinks below a critical point, its flow stops and it becomes stationary. Meanwhile, meltwater within and beneath the ice leaves [[Stratigraphy|stratified]] alluvial deposits. These deposits, in the forms of columns, [[Terrace (geology)|terraces]] and clusters, remain after the glacier melts and are known as \"glacial deposits\".\n\nGlacial deposits that take the shape of hills or mounds are called ''[[kame]]s''. Some kames form when meltwater deposits sediments through openings in the interior of the ice. Others are produced by fans or [[river delta|deltas]] created by meltwater.  When the glacial ice occupies a valley, it can form terraces or kames along the sides of the valley.\n\nLong, sinuous glacial deposits are called ''[[eskers]]''.  Eskers are composed of sand and gravel that was deposited by meltwater streams that flowed through ice tunnels within or beneath a glacier. They remain after the ice melts, with heights exceeding 100&nbsp;meters and lengths of as long as 100&nbsp;km.\n\n===Loess deposits===\nVery fine glacial sediments or [[rock flour]] is often picked up by wind blowing over the bare surface and may be deposited great distances from the original fluvial deposition site. These [[Eolian processes|eolian]] [[loess]] deposits may be very deep, even hundreds of meters, as in areas of China and the Midwestern United States of America. [[Katabatic wind]]s can be important in this process.\n\n==Isostatic rebound==\n{{Main article|Post-glacial rebound}}\n[[File:Glacier weight effects LMB.png|right|frame|Isostatic pressure by a glacier on the Earth's crust]]\nLarge masses, such as ice sheets or glaciers, can depress the crust of the Earth into the mantle.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UYrRG2ocHoC&pg=PT95&dq=Large+masses,+such+as+ice+sheets+and+glaciers,+can+depress+the+crust+of+the+Earth+into+the+mantle.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9uPj-_bvUAhUR2mMKHaWYAQ4Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=Large%20masses,%20such%20as%20ice%20sheets%20and%20glaciers,%20can%20depress%20the%20crust%20of%20the%20Earth%20into%20the%20mantle.&f=false|title=Global Warming Cycles: Ice Ages and Glacial Retreat|last=Casper|first=Julie Kerr|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816072620|language=en}}</ref>  The depression usually totals a third of the ice sheet or glacier's thickness.   After the ice sheet or glacier melts, the mantle begins to flow back to its original position, pushing the crust back up. This [[post-glacial rebound]], which proceeds very slowly after the melting of the ice sheet or glacier, is currently occurring in measurable amounts in [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Great Lakes]] region of North America.\n\nA geomorphological feature created by the same process on a smaller scale is known as ''dilation-faulting''. It occurs where previously compressed rock is allowed to return to its original shape more rapidly than can be maintained without faulting.  This leads to an effect similar to what would be seen if the rock were hit by a large hammer. Dilation faulting can be observed in recently de-glaciated parts of Iceland and Cumbria.\n\n==On Mars==\n[[File:Mars north pole.jpg|thumb|left|Northern [[polar ice cap]] on [[Mars]]]]\n{{main article|Glaciers on Mars}}\nThe polar [[ice cap]]s of [[Mars]] show geologic evidence of glacial deposits.

As on Earth, many glaciers are covered with a layer of rocks which insulates the ice. A radar instrument on board the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] found ice under a thin layer of rocks in formations called [[lobate debris apron]]s (LDAs).<ref>Head, J. et al.  2005.

The ''Gylfaginning'' deals with the creation and destruction of the world of the [[Norse gods]], and many other aspects of [[Norse mythology]]. The second part of the Prose Edda is called the ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' and the third ''[[H\u00e1ttatal]]''.\n\n== Summary ==\nThe ''Gylfaginning'' tells the story of Gylfi, a king of \"the land that men now call Sweden\", who after being tricked by one of the goddesses of the [[\u00c6sir]], wonders if all [[\u00c6sir]] use magic and tricks for their will to be done. This is why he journeys to [[Asgard]], but on the way he is tricked by the gods and arrives in some other place, where he finds a great palace. Inside the palace he encounters a man who asks Gylfi's name and so King Gylfi introduces himself as Gangleri. Gangleri then is taken to the king of the palace and comes upon three men; [[High, Just-As-High, and Third]].\n\nGangleri is then challenged to show his wisdom by asking questions, as is the custom in many [[Norse sagas]]. Each question made to High, Just-As-High, and Third is about an aspect of the Norse mythology or its gods, and also about the creation and destruction of the world ([[Ragnar\u00f6k]]). In the end all the palace and its people just vanish and Gylfi is left standing on empty ground. It is then implied that as Gylfi returns to his nation, he retells the tales he was told. It can be argued that Snorri used this narrative device as a means of being able to safely document a vanishing and largely oral tradition within a [[Christian]] context.\n\n==External links==\n{{wikisourcepar|Prose Edda/Gylfaginning|Gylfaginning}}\n{{wikisourcepar|Prose Edda}}\n{{wikisourcepar|Edda}}\n* [http://www.heimskringla.no/wiki/Gylfaginning Gylfaginning] in [[Old Norse]] at heimskringla.no\n* [http://www.hi.is/~eybjorn/gg/index.html Text of all original manuscripts]\n* [http://www.snerpa.is/net/snorri/gylf.htm The text with modern Icelandic spelling]\n* [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/pre/pre04.htm English translation]\n\n\n{{Prose Edda}}\n\n[[Category:Eschatology in Norse mythology]]\n[[Category:Sources of Norse mythology]]\n[[Category:Old Norse prose]]\n[[Category:Works by Snorri Sturluson]]\n\n{{Norse-myth-stub}}", "sha1": "kw357krb3r5ucqpx2vl08ky1u0r7g6y"}}, {"title": "Gleipnr", "ns": "0", "id": "12465", "redirect": {"title": "Fenrir"}, "revision": {"id": "147154531", "parentid": "15910151", "timestamp": "2007-07-26T04:09:47Z", "contributor": {"username": "RussBot", "id": "279219"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Robot: Fixing [[Special:DoubleRedirects|double-redirect]] -\"Fenrisulfr\" +\"Fenrir\"", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Fenrir]]", "sha1": "hgtbb4ksr63if7yd6bjlftlvcoxjqu3"}}, {"title": "Glorious Revolution", "ns": "0", "id": "12466", "revision": {"id": "866327559", "parentid": "866310551", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T18:03:54Z", "contributor": {"username": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "id": "25523690"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/70.248.28.24|70.248.28.24]] identified as test/vandalism using [[WP:STiki|STiki]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect|The Bloodless Revolution|a history of the vegetarian movement|The Bloodless Revolution (book)}}\n{{About|the English revolution of 1688|the revolution of 1868 in Spain|Glorious Revolution (Spain)|other uses}}\n{{Infobox historical event\n  |Event_Name     = Glorious Revolution\n  |Image_Name     = Prince of Orange engraving by William Miller after Turner R739.jpg\n  |Imagesize      = 250px\n  |Image_Caption  = The Prince of Orange lands at Torbay\n  |AKA            = Revolution of 1688<br />War of the English Succession<br />Bloodless Revolution\n  |Participants   = English, Welsh and Scottish society, Dutch forces\n  |Location       = British Isles\n  |Date           = 1688\u20131689\n  |Result         =\n* Replacement of James II by [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II]]\n* [[Jacobite rising of 1689]]\n* [[Williamite War in Ireland]]\n* [[Nine Years' War|War with France]]; England and Scotland join Grand Alliance\n* Drafting of the [[Bill of Rights 1689]]\n}}\n\n{{EngvarB|date=February 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2017}}\n{{History of England}}\nThe '''Glorious Revolution''', also called the '''Revolution of 1688''', was the overthrow of King [[James II of England]] (James VII of Scotland) by a union of English [[Parliamentarianism|Parliamentarians]] with the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[stadtholder]] William III, [[Prince of Orange]], who was James's nephew and son-in-law.  William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascension to the throne as [[William III of England]] jointly with his wife, [[Mary II]], James's daughter, after the [[Declaration of Right]], leading to the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].\n\nKing James's policies of [[religious tolerance]] after 1685 met with increasing opposition from members of leading political circles, who were troubled by the King's [[Catholicism]] and his close ties with France. The crisis facing the King came to a head in 1688, with the birth of his son, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James]], on 10 June (Julian calendar).<ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/> This changed the existing [[line of succession]] by displacing the [[heir presumptive]] (his 26-year-old daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of William of Orange) with young James as [[heir apparent]]. The establishment of a Roman Catholic dynasty in the kingdoms now seemed likely. Some [[Tory]] members of parliament worked with members of the opposition [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] in an attempt to resolve the crisis by secretly initiating dialogue with William of Orange to come to England, outside the jurisdiction of the English Parliament.{{sfn|Coward|1980|pp=298\u2013302}} Stadtholder William, the de facto head of state of the [[Dutch United Provinces]], feared a Catholic Anglo\u2013French alliance and had already been planning a military intervention in England.\n\nAfter consolidating political and financial support, William crossed the [[North Sea]] and [[English Channel]] with a large invasion fleet in November 1688, landing at [[Torbay]]. After only two minor clashes between the two opposing armies in England, and [[anti-Catholic riots]] in several towns, James's regime collapsed, largely because of a lack of resolve shown by the king. This was followed, however, by the protracted [[Williamite War in Ireland]] and [[Dundee's rising]] in Scotland.<ref group=lower-alpha>England, Scotland, and Ireland at the time shared a king but were still theoretically separate realms with their own parliaments. In practice, the [[Parliament of Ireland]] had been completely under the control of Westminster since [[Poynings' Law]] of 1494, but Scotland still had a degree of independence.</ref> In England's distant American colonies, the revolution led to the collapse of the [[Dominion of New England]] and the overthrow of the [[Province of Maryland]]'s government. Following a defeat of his forces at the [[Battle of Reading (1688)|Battle of Reading]] on 9 December, James and his wife [[Mary of Modena|Mary]] fled England; James, however, returned to London for a two-week period that culminated in his final departure for France on 23 December. By threatening to withdraw his troops, William in February 1689 ([[New Style]] Julian calendar)<ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/> convinced a newly chosen [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] to make him and his wife [[joint monarchs]].\n\nThe Revolution permanently ended any chance of Catholicism becoming re-established in England. For British Catholics its effects were disastrous both socially and politically: For over a century Catholics were denied the right to vote and sit in the Westminster Parliament; they were also denied [[Officer (armed forces)|commissions]] in the [[History of the British Army#Origins|army]], and the monarch was [[Act of Settlement 1701|forbidden to be Catholic or to marry a Catholic]], this latter prohibition remaining in force [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013|until 2015]]. The Revolution led to limited tolerance for Nonconformist Protestants, although it would be some time before they had full [[political rights]]. It has been argued, mainly by [[Whig historians]], that James's overthrow began modern English [[parliamentary democracy]]: the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] has become one of the most important documents in the [[political history]] of Britain and never since has the monarch held [[Absolute monarchy|absolute]] power.\n\nInternationally, the Revolution was related to the [[War of the Grand Alliance]] on [[mainland Europe]]. It has been seen as the last successful invasion of England.<ref>See e.g. {{harvnb|Israel|199its preejdj1|p=105}}; see also {{harvnb|Israel|Parker|1991|pp=335\u201364}}</ref> It ended all attempts by England in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th&nbsp;century to subdue the [[Dutch Republic]] by military force.  The resulting economic integration and military co-operation between the English and Dutch navies, however, shifted the dominance in world trade from the Dutch Republic to England and later to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].\n\nThe expression \"Glorious Revolution\" was first used by [[John Hampden (1653\u20131696)|John Hampden]] in late 1689,<ref>In testimony before a House of Lords committee in the autumn of 1689 ({{harvnb|Schwoerer|2004|p=3}}).</ref> and is an expression that is still used by the [[British Parliament]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/guides/factsheets/general/g04/ |title=The Glorious Revolution |publisher=www.parliament.uk|accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref> The Glorious Revolution is also occasionally termed the ''Bloodless Revolution'', albeit inaccurately.  The [[English Civil War]] (also known as the Great Rebellion) was still within living memory for most of the major English participants in the events of 1688, and for them, in comparison to that war (or even the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] of 1685) the deaths in the conflict of 1688 were few.\n\n==Background==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}<!--3 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:James II & VII.jpg|thumb|upright|James II & VII, King of England, Scotland and Ireland]]\n\nDuring his three-year reign, [[King James II]] became directly involved in the political battles in England between [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]], and between the concept of the [[divine right of kings]] and the political rights of the [[Parliament of England]]. James's greatest political problem was his Catholicism, which left him alienated from both parties in England. The [[low church]] [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] had failed in their attempt to pass the [[Exclusion Bill]] to exclude James from the throne between 1679 and 1681, and James's supporters were the [[high church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Tories (political faction)|Tories]]. In [[Scotland]], his supporters in the [[Parliament of Scotland]] stepped up attempts to force the [[Covenanter]]s to renounce their faith and accept [[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] rule of the church by the monarch.\n\nWhen James inherited the English throne in 1685, he had much support in the 'Loyal Parliament', which was composed mostly of Tories. His Catholicism was of concern to many, but the fact that he had no son, and his daughters, [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], were Protestants, was a \"saving grace\". James's attempt to relax the [[penal law (Britain)#English statutes on religious nonconformity|Penal Laws]] alienated his natural supporters, however, because the Tories viewed this as tantamount to [[disestablishment]] of the [[Church of England]]. Abandoning the Tories, James looked to form a 'King's party' as a counterweight to the Anglican Tories, so in 1687 James supported the policy of [[religious toleration]] and issued the [[Declaration of Indulgence]]. The majority of Irish people backed James II for this reason and also because of his promise to the Irish Parliament of a greater future autonomy.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Harris|title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685\u20131720|location=London|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7139-9759-0|page=440}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/30064327|title=A 'Beleaguered Protestant'?: Walter Harris and the Writing of ''Fiction Unmasked'' in Mid-18th-Century Ireland|first=Eoin|last=Magennis|pages=6\u2013111|journal=Eighteenth-Century Ireland|volume=13|year=1998|accessdate=16 March 2012}}</ref> By allying himself with the Catholics, [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]], and [[Nonconformists]], James hoped to build a coalition that would advance Catholic emancipation.\n\nIn May 1686, James decided to obtain from the English courts of the [[common law]] a ruling that affirmed his power to dispense with Acts of Parliament. He dismissed judges who disagreed with him on this matter as well as the Solicitor General [[Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Aylesford|Heneage Finch]]. Eleven out of the twelve judges ruled in favour of dispensing power.{{sfn|Macaulay|1889|pp=368\u201369}} When [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]], the [[Bishop of London]], did not ban [[John Sharp (Archbishop of York)|John Sharp]] from preaching after he gave an anti-Catholic sermon, James ordered his removal.{{sfn|Carpenter|1956|pp=96\u201398}}\n\nIn April 1687, James ordered the fellows of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] to elect a Catholic, [[Anthony Farmer]], as their president. The fellows believed Farmer ineligible under the college's statutes and so elected [[John Hough (bishop)|John Hough]] instead. The college statutes required them to fill the vacancy within a certain time and so could not wait for a further royal nomination. James refused to view Hough's election as valid and told the fellows to elect the [[Bishop of Oxford]]. James responded by sending some ecclesiastical commissioners to hold a visitation and install him as president. The fellows then agreed to the Bishop of Oxford as their president but James required that they admit they had been in the wrong and ask for his pardon. When they refused most of the fellows were ejected and replaced by Catholics.{{sfn|Western|1972|p=201}}\n\nIn 1687, James prepared to pack Parliament with his supporters so that it would repeal the [[Test Act]] and the penal laws. James was convinced by addresses from Dissenters that he had their support and so could dispense with relying on Tories and Anglicans. James instituted a wholesale purge of those in offices under the crown opposed to James's plan.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=132}} In August the [[Lord Lieutenant|lieutenancy]] was remodelled and in September over one thousand members of the city [[livery company|livery companies]] were ejected. In October James gave orders for the lords lieutenants in the provinces to provide three standard questions to all members of the [[Justice of the Peace|Commission of the peace]]: would they consent to the repeal of the Test Act and the penal laws; would they assist candidates who would do so; and they were requested to accept the Declaration of Indulgence. In December it was announced that all the offices of deputy lieutenants and Justices of the Peace would be revised. Therefore, during the first three months of 1688, hundreds of those who gave hostile replies to the three questions asked were dismissed. More far-reaching purges were applied to the towns: in November a regulating committee was founded to operate the purges.{{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=132\u201333}} Corporations were purged by agents given wide discretionary powers in an attempt to create a permanent royal electoral machine.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=146}} Finally, on 24 August 1688,<ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/> James ordered writs to be issued for a general election.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=150}}\n\n[[File:The Seven Bishops committed to the Tower in 1688 from NPG.jpg|thumb|Group portrait of the [[Seven Bishops]] whom James ordered imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] in 1688, but who were acquitted of charges of [[seditious libel]].]]\n\nJames also created a large [[standing army]] and employed Catholics in positions of power within it. To his opponents in Parliament this seemed like a prelude to arbitrary rule, so James [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] Parliament without gaining their consent. At this time, the English regiments of the army were encamped at [[Hounslow]], near the capital. It was feared that the location was intended to overawe the City.{{sfn|Childs|1980|pp=96\u201397}} The army in Ireland was purged of Protestants, who were replaced with Catholics, and by 1688 James had more than 34,000 men under arms.\n\nIn April 1688, James re-issued the [[Declaration of Indulgence]] and ordered all clergymen to read it in their churches. When the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[William Sancroft]], and six other bishops (the [[Seven Bishops]]) wrote to James asking him to reconsider his policies, they were arrested on charges of [[seditious libel]], but at trial they were acquitted to the cheers of the London crowd.\n\nMatters came to a head in June 1688, when the King had a son, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James]]; until then, the throne would have passed to his Protestant daughter, Mary. The prospect of a Catholic dynasty in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] was now likely.\n\n==Conspiracy==\nMary had a husband, her cousin [[William III of England|William Henry of Orange]]. Both were Protestants and grandchildren of [[Charles I of England]]. Before the birth of James's son on 10 June,<ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/> William had been third in the line of succession.<ref group=lower-alpha>After Mary's sister Anne. This line of succession was overturned by the Bill of Rights; see [[Succession to the British throne]]</ref> There was a strong faction, however, at the English court, headed by [[Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland]], proposing that Mary and William, because of their anti-Catholic position, should be replaced by some Catholic French heir.{{sfn|Troost|2001|pp=182\u201383}}\n\nWilliam was also [[stadtholder]] of the main provinces of the [[Dutch Republic]], then in the preliminary stages of joining the [[War of the Grand Alliance]] against France, in a context of international tensions caused by the revocation by [[Louis XIV]] of the [[Edict of Nantes]] and the disputed succession of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]] and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. William had already acquired the reputation of being the main champion in Europe of the Protestant cause against Catholicism and French absolutism; in the developing English crisis he saw an opportunity to prevent an Anglo-French alliance and bring England to the anti-French side, by carrying out a military intervention directed against James. This suited the desires of several English politicians who intended to depose James. It is still a matter of debate whether the initiative for the conspiracy was taken by the English or by the stadtholder and his wife. William had been trying to influence English politics for well over a year, letting [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Gaspar Fagel]] publish an [[open letter]] to the English people in November 1687 deploring the religious policy of James, which action had generally been interpreted as a covert bid for kingship.\n\n[[File:Willem III (1650-1702), prins van Oranje. Stadhouder, sedert 1689 tevens koning van Engeland Rijksmuseum SK-A-1228.jpeg|thumb|''William III'', King of England, Scotland and Ireland, stadtholder of Guelders, Holland, Zealand, Utrecht and Overijssel]]\n\nSince he had become king the relationship between James and his nephew and son-in-law had gradually deteriorated. Initially William welcomed the promise of a less pro-French policy. In 1685 he sent the Scottish and English mercenary regiments of his army to England to assist in putting down the [[Monmouth Rebellion]].{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=176}} Soon James's policy of religious tolerance caused tensions to rise between them. William assumed it was but the first step towards a total re-Catholicisation of England and was unable to explain how James could hope to achieve this goal unless he had concluded a secret alliance with France. James's refusal to enter any anti-French coalition and his efforts to reorganise the Royal Navy increased William's suspicions. In the previous years the French navy had grown significantly in strength and the Dutch Republic would no longer be able to resist a combined Anglo-French attack.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=182}} William feared that even English neutrality would not suffice and that control over the Royal Navy was a prerequisite for a successful naval campaign against France.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=187}}\n\nIn November 1686 James had wished to gain William's support for the repeal of the [[Test Acts]], as this would have delivered a blow to the English opposition. The Quaker [[William Penn]] was sent to The Hague but William opposed repeal.{{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=218\u201319}} William's envoy [[Everhard van Weede Dijkvelt]] visited England between February and May 1687 (N.S.), instructed to persuade James to help contain French aggression. William also instructed Dijkvelt to let it be known that he would support the Church of England; that he was not a Presbyterian; to persuade the Dissenters not to support James and to reassure moderate Catholics.{{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=219\u201320}} After having been assured by James that all rumours about a French alliance were malevolent fabrications, Dijkvelt returned to the Republic, with letters of varying importance from leading English statesmen. James tried again to gain William's support but William responded by advising James to keep to the law and not try to extend his prerogative powers.{{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=221\u201322}} In August 1687 Count [[William Nassau de Zuylestein, 1st Earl of Rochford|William Nassau de Zuylestein]] was sent to England, ostensibly to send condolences due to the death of the queen's mother. Zuylestein was sent in part to see how successful, or amenable, James's packed Parliament would be, and have discussions with English statesmen, with Zuylestein sending letters from them back to William.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=222}}\n\nThe correspondence between William and the English politicians was, at first, sent by ordinary post to genuine addresses in either country and then distributed. Devices were used such as ending a postscript with \"etc.\", which meant spaces were actually written in white or invisible ink. As the conspiracy neared completion in 1688, the English government sometimes disrupted this correspondence by holding up the whole mail delivery system. In another method to keep this clandestine correspondence flowing, letters were sent in merchant ships between London and Amsterdam or Rotterdam, with outward bound letters often put on board below Gravesend, after the final customs clearance. Also, couriers for the purpose were sometimes used, and all Dutch diplomats travelling to and from either country carried the correspondence. Shortly before the invasion, when rapid delivery and secrecy were essential, fast yachts and small vessels were used for special courier services. The English government intercepted very few of these means of communication.{{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=223\u201324}}\n\nIt has been suggested that the crisis caused by the prospect of a new Catholic heir made William decide to invade the next summer as early as November 1687,<ref>{{harvnb|Hoak|1996|p=24}}</ref> but this is disputed{{citation needed|reason=By who?|date=October 2018}}. It is certain however that in April 1688, when France and England concluded a naval agreement stipulating that the French would finance an English squadron in The Channel, which seemed to be the beginning of a formal alliance, he seriously began to prepare for a military intervention and seek political and financial support for such an undertaking.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=191}}\n\n===William seeks English commitment to an invasion===\nWilliam laid careful plans over a number of months for an invasion, which he hoped to execute in September 1688. William would not invade England without assurances of English support, and so in April, he asked for a formal invitation to be issued by a group of leading English statesmen. [[Gilbert Burnet]] recorded a conversation at the end of April between William and Admiral [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Edward Russell]]:\n\n{{quote|So Russell put the Prince to explain himself what he intended to do. The Prince answered, that, if he was invited by some men of the best interest, and the most valued in the nation, who should both in their own name, and in the name of others who trusted them, invite him to come and rescue the nation and the religion, he believed he could be ready by the end of September to come over.|Gilbert Burnet.{{sfn|Baxter|1966|p=225}} }}\n\n[[File:Earl of Romney.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Sydney, 1st Earl of Romney|Henry Sydney]], author of the [[Invitation to William]], which was signed by six noblemen (both Whigs and Tories) and one bishop.

William feared that if he did not now head the conspiracy the English would set up a republic, even more inimical to the Dutch state.{{sfn|Baxter|1966|p=231}} In June, William sent Count Zuylestein to England, ostensibly to congratulate James on the birth of the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Prince of Wales]] but in reality to communicate with William's associates.{{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=238\u201339}}\n\nOnly after the Prince of Wales had been born in June, however, and many suspected he was [[Supposititious children|supposititious]],<ref group=lower-alpha>It was rumoured that he was a baby who had been smuggled into the royal bedchamber in a warming pan, but this is not now taken seriously.</ref> did the Immortal Seven (who consisted of one bishop and six nobles) decide to comply, with the [[Invitation to William|letter to William]] dated 18 June (Julian calendar),<ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/> reaching him in [[The Hague]] on 30 June,<!--Needs clarification if Julian of Gregorian calendar--> and dispatched by [[Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington|Rear Admiral Herbert]], disguised as a common sailor.

The invitation declared:\n\n{{quote|We have great reason to believe, we shall be every day in a worse condition than we are, and less able to defend ourselves, and therefore we do earnestly wish we might be so happy as to find a remedy before it be too late for us to contribute to our own deliverance&nbsp;... the people are so generally dissatisfied with the present conduct of the government, in relation to their religion, liberties and properties (all which have been greatly invaded), and they are in such expectation of their prospects being daily worse, that your Highness may be assured, there are nineteen parts of twenty of the people throughout the kingdom, who are desirous of a change; and who, we believe, would willingly contribute to it, if they had such a protection to countenance their rising, as would secure them from being destroyed.|invitation by The Seven.{{sfn|Dalrymple|1790|loc=appendix to book&nbsp;v, pp.&nbsp;107\u201310}} }}\n\nThe Seven went on to claim that \"much the greatest part of the nobility and gentry\" were dissatisfied and would rally to William, and that James's army \"would be very much divided among themselves; many of the officers being so discontented that they continue in their service only for a subsistence&nbsp;... and very many of the common soldiers do daily shew such an aversion to the Popish religion, that there is the greatest probability imaginable of great numbers of deserters&nbsp;... and amongst the seamen, it is almost certain, there is not one in ten who would do them any service in such a war\".{{sfn|Dalrymple|1790|loc=appendix to book v, p. 108}} The Seven believed that the situation would be much worse before another year due to James's plans to remodel the army by the means of a packed Parliament or, should the parliamentary route fail, through violent means which would \"prevent all possible means of relieving ourselves\".{{sfn|Dalrymple|1790|loc=appendix to book v, pp. 108\u201309}} The Seven also promised to rally to William upon his landing in England and would \"do all that lies in our power to prepare others to be in as much readiness as such an action is capable of\".{{sfn|Dalrymple|1790|loc=appendix to book v, p. 109}}\n\nMeanwhile, William's confidante [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|Willem Bentinck]] launched a propaganda campaign in England. In the numerous [[pamphlet]]s distributed, William was presented in the best possible light; as a true Stuart yet blessedly free from the usual Stuart vices of crypto-Catholicism, absolutism, and debauchery. Much of the later \"spontaneous\" support for William had been carefully organised by Bentinck and his agents<ref>{{Cite book|title=Louis XIV Outside In: Images of the Sun King Beyond France, 1661-1715|last=Tony Claydon, Charles-\u00c9douard Levillain|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781317103240|location=|pages=150}}</ref>.\n\nIn August, it became clear that William had surprisingly strong support within the English army, a situation brought about by James himself. In January 1688 he had forbidden any of his subjects to serve the Dutch and had demanded that the Republic dissolve its six mercenary Scottish and English regiments. When this was refused, he asked that at least those willing would be released from their martial oath to be free to return to Britain. To this William consented as it would purify his army of Jacobite elements. In total 104&nbsp;officers and 44&nbsp;soldiers returned. The officers were enlisted within the British armies and so favoured that the established officer corps began to fear for its position. On 14 August<!--Julian or Georgian calendar? Needs checking--> [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Lord Churchill]] wrote to William: \"I owe it to God and my country to put my honour into the hands of Your Highness\". Nothing comparable happened within the Royal Navy, however; claims after the event by certain captains that they had somehow prevented the English fleet from engaging seem to have been little more than attempts at self-aggrandisement.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=139}}\n\n===Military and financial support===\nFor William the English problem was inextricably intertwined with the situation in Germany. Only if the attention of Louis&nbsp;XIV was directed to the east could William hope to intervene in England without French interference. For this it was essential that Austria continued opposing the French demands regarding Cologne and the Palatinate. In May, William sent an envoy, Johann von G\u00f6rtz, [[privy councillor]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Cassel]], to [[Vienna]] to ensure secretly the support of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]]. Learning that William promised not to persecute the Catholics in England, the emperor approved of the expedition, promising in turn to try making peace with the [[Ottoman Empire]] to free his forces for a campaign in the West; on 4 September 1688<!--Julian or Gregorian as it is on the continent?--> he would join an alliance with the Republic against France. The Duke of [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]], [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Ernest Augustus]], and the Elector of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[John George III, Elector of Saxony|John George III]], assured William that they would remain neutral, though it had been feared they would take the French side.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=198}}\n\n[[File:Francisco Lopes Suasso.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Lopes Suasso]], who partly financed the invasion]]\n\nThe next concern was to assemble a powerful invasion force \u2013 contrary to the wishes of the English conspirators, who predicted that a token force would be sufficient. For this William needed funding by the city of [[Amsterdam]], then the world's main [[financial centre]]. In earlier years Amsterdam had been strongly pro-French, often forcing William to moderate his policies, but a [[tariff war]] waged by Louis from 1687 against the Republic and French import limitations on [[herring]], a major Dutch export, had outraged the wealthy merchants. Nevertheless, only after secret and difficult negotiations by Bentinck with the hesitant Amsterdam [[burgomaster]]s during June could 260 transports be hired. Additionally, the burghers were uneasy about the prospect of denuding their homeland of its defences by sending the field army \u2013 roughly half of the total peace-time strength of the [[Dutch States Army]] of about 30,000 \u2013 overseas. Bentinck, who had already been sent in May to [[Brandenburg]] to recruit, but without much result, therefore negotiated contracts from 20 July (Gregorian calendar) for 13,616 German mercenaries from Brandenburg, [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], Hesse-Cassel, and [[Celle]] to man Dutch border fortresses in order to free an equal number of Dutch elite mercenary troops for use against England.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=38}} As the Dutch would typically double or triple their total army strength in wartime, the numbers were low enough to be explained as a limited precaution against French aggression. Shortly afterwards, Marshal [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|Frederick Schomberg]] was instructed by William to prepare for a Western campaign.{{sfn|Baxter|1966|pp=232\u201333}}\n\nFurther financial support was obtained from the most disparate sources: the Jewish banker [[Francisco Lopes Suasso]] lent two million guilders;{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=52}} when asked what security he desired, Suasso answered: \"If you are victorious, you will surely repay me; if not, the loss is mine.\"{{sfn|Swetschinsky|Sch\u00f6nduve|1988|p=53}} Even [[Pope Innocent XI]], an inveterate enemy of Louis XIV of France, provided a loan to William, though a relation with the invasion has been denied.<ref name=kelly288>Kelly, 288 {{Verify source|date=August 2010}}</ref> Total costs were seven million guilders, four million of which would ultimately be paid for by a state loan. In the summer the Dutch navy was expanded to 9000&nbsp;sailors on the pretext of fighting the [[Dunkirkers]]. The standard summer equipment of twenty warships was secretly doubled. On 13 July 1688 (Gregorian calendar) it was decided to build 21 new warships.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|p=287}}\n\n===The final decision to invade is taken===\nDespite all the preparations, William had great trouble convincing the Dutch class of city and provincial rulers, the [[regenten|regents]], that such an expensive expedition was really necessary. Also, he personally feared that the French might attack the Republic through [[Flanders]] when its army was tied up in England. One of the \"Seven\", Lord Danby, suggested postponing the invasion until the following year. By early September, William was on the brink of cancelling the entire expedition when French policy played into his hand.\n\nIn Germany, matters had come to a head. The Pope had refused to confirm Louis's favourite candidate for the [[bishopric of Cologne]], [[William Egon of F\u00fcrstenberg]]. Enraged, the French king decided to execute a lightning campaign into Germany before the emperor could shift his troops to the West. Louis also hoped to keep his Turkish ally in the war this way. For the immediate future James had to hold his own, something Louis expected him to be quite capable of, especially if the Dutch were intimidated. On 9 September (Gregorian calendar) the French envoy [[Jean Antoine de Mesmes]], the Comte d'Avaux, handed two letters from the French king, who had known of the invasion plans since May, to the [[States General of the Netherlands]].{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=41}} In the first they were warned not to attack James. In the second they were advised not to interfere with the French policy in Germany. James hurriedly distanced himself from the first message, trying to convince the States General that there was no secret Anglo-French alliance against them.<ref group=lower-alpha>As there had been in 1672 with the concerted attack by France and England on the Republic on the basis of the [[Secret treaty of Dover]].</ref> This had precisely the opposite effect: many members became extremely suspicious. The second message proved that the main French effort was directed to the east, not the north, so there was no immediate danger of a French invasion for the Republic itself.\n\nFrom 22 September,<ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/> Louis XIV seized all Dutch ships present in French ports,{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=39}} totalling about a hundred vessels, apparently proving that real war with France was imminent, though Louis had meant it to be a mere warning. On 26 September the powerful city council of Amsterdam decided to officially support the invasion. On 27 September Louis crossed the Rhine into Germany to attack [[Philippsburg]] and William began to move the Dutch field army from the eastern borders, where it had trained on the [[Mookerheide]], to the coast, even though most of the new mercenaries had not yet arrived.\n\nOn 29 September the [[States of Holland]], the government of the most important Dutch province, fearing a French-English alliance, gathered in secret session and approved the operation, agreeing to make the English \"King and Nation live in a good relation, and useful to their friends and allies, and especially to this State\". They accepted William's argument that a [[pre-emptive war|preventive strike]] was necessary to avoid a repeat of the events of 1672,{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=37}} when England and France had [[Third Anglo-Dutch War|jointly attacked the Republic]], \"an attempt to bring this state to its ultimate ruin and subjugation, as soon as they find the occasion\". William denied any intention \"to remove the King from the throne or become master of England\". The States ordered a Dutch fleet of 53 warships to escort the troop transports. This fleet was in fact commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral [[Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest]] on the ''Cortgene'' and Vice-Admiral [[Philips van Almonde]] on the ''Provincie Utrecht'' but in consideration of English sensitivities placed, on 6 October, under the nominal command of Rear-Admiral Herbert, who for the occasion was appointed Lieutenant-Admiral-General, i.e. acting supreme commander, of the Dutch navy.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|p=288}} He sailed on the ''Leyden'', accompanied by Lieutenant-Admiral [[Willem Bastiaensz Schepers]], the Rotterdam shipping magnate who had organised the transport fleet. Though William was himself Admiral-General of the Republic, he, as was usual, abstained from operational command, sailing conspicuously on the new frigate ''Den Briel''. The States General allowed the core regiments of the Dutch field army to participate under command of Marshall Schomberg. Despite being assisted in it by the regular Dutch fleet and field army, his attempt to change the situation in England was, as the States General made explicit, officially a private family affair of William, merely acting in his capacity of concerned nephew and son-in-law to James, not an undertaking of the Dutch Republic as such.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=198}}\n\n==Invasion==\n===Embarkation of the army and the Declaration of The Hague===\n[[File:William III Landing at Brixham, Torbay, 5 November 1688.jpg|thumb|Equestrian portrait of William III by [[Jan Wyck]], commemorating the landing at Brixham, Torbay, 5 November 1688]]\n\nThe Dutch preparations, though carried out with great speed, could not remain secret. The English envoy [[Ignatius White]], the Marquess d'Albeville, warned his country: \"an absolute conquest is intended under the specious and ordinary pretences of religion, liberty, property and a free Parliament&nbsp;...\". Louis XIV threatened the Dutch with an immediate declaration of war, should they carry out their plans. Embarkations, started on 22 September ([[Gregorian calendar]]), had been completed on 8 October, and the expedition was that day openly approved by the States of Holland; the same day James issued a proclamation to the English nation that it should prepare for a Dutch invasion to ward off conquest. On 30 September/10 October ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]/[[Gregorian calendar]]s) William issued the ''Declaration of The Hague'' (actually written by Fagel), of which 60,000&nbsp;copies of the English translation by Gilbert Burnet were distributed after the landing in England,{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Williams|1960|pp=10\u201316}} in which he assured that his only aim was to maintain the Protestant religion, install a free parliament and investigate the legitimacy of the Prince of Wales. He would respect the position of James. William declared:\n\n{{quote|It is both certain and evident to all men, that the public peace and happiness of any state or kingdom cannot be preserved, where the Laws, Liberties, and Customs, established by the lawful authority in it, are openly transgressed and annulled; more especially where the alteration of Religion is endeavoured, and that a religion, which is contrary to law, is endeavoured to be introduced; upon which those who are most immediately concerned in it are indispensably bound to endeavour to preserve and maintain the established Laws, Liberties and customs, and, above all, the Religion and Worship of God, that is established among them; and to take such an effectual care, that the inhabitants of the said state or kingdom may neither be deprived of their Religion, nor of their Civil Rights.|[[William III of England|William of Orange]].{{sfn|Speck|1989|p=74}}}}\n\nWilliam went on to condemn James's advisers for overturning the religion, laws, and liberties of England, Scotland, and Ireland by the use of the suspending and dispensing power; the establishment of the \"manifestly illegal\" commission for ecclesiastical causes and its use to suspend the [[Bishop of London]] and to remove the Fellows of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. William also condemned James's attempt to repeal the [[Test Act]]s and the penal laws through pressuring individuals and waging an assault on parliamentary boroughs, as well as his purging of the judiciary. James's attempt to pack Parliament was in danger of removing \"the last and great remedy for all those evils\". \"Therefore\", William continued, \"we have thought fit to go over to England, and to carry over with us a force sufficient, by the blessing of God, to defend us from the violence of those evil Counsellors&nbsp;... this our Expedition is intended for no other design, but to have, a free and lawful Parliament assembled as soon as is possible\".{{sfn|Speck|1989|pp= 74\u201375}}\n\nOn [[Old Style and New Style dates|4/14]] October William responded to the allegations by James in a second declaration, denying any intention to become king or conquer England. Whether he had any at that moment is still controversial.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=199}}\n\nThe swiftness of the embarkations surprised all foreign observers. Louis had in fact delayed his threats against the Dutch until early September because he assumed it then would be too late in the season to set the expedition in motion anyway, if their reaction proved negative; typically such an enterprise would take at least some months.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=137}} Being ready after the last week of September / first week of October would normally have meant that the Dutch could have profited from the last spell of good weather, as the autumn storms tend to begin in the third week of that month. This year they came early however. For three weeks the invasion fleet was prevented by adverse south-westerly gales from departing from the naval port of [[Hellevoetsluis]] and Catholics all over the Netherlands and the British kingdoms held prayer sessions that this \"popish wind\" might endure. However, on [[Old Style and New Style dates|14/24]]&nbsp;October it became the famous \"[[Protestant Wind]]\" by turning to the east.{{sfn|Jones|1973|pp=201\u201321}}\n\n===English naval strategy===\nJames only in late August seriously began to consider the possibility of a Dutch invasion and then overestimated the size of the naval force the Dutch would bring against him. He assumed they would equip their full battle fleet, which he himself would be unable to match for financial reasons: in October about thirty English ships-of-the-line had been assembled, all [[third rate]]s or [[fourth rate]]s, while heavier vessels remained laid up. Fearing a surprise attack, he declined to position this fleet at [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|The Downs]], for striking into the southern [[North Sea]] or the Channel the most convenient location, but also a very vulnerable one. When Admiral [[George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth]] decided to place his fleet at the [[Gunfleet]] near the [[Medway]], in a rather withdrawn location, James therefore merely suggested to bring the fleet farther out, though he well understood it otherwise risked becoming locked up in the [[Thames]] estuary by the same easterly wind that would allow the Dutch to cross. This was influenced by his belief the Dutch might well attack France instead and his expectation that they would first seek a naval victory before daring to invade \u2013 and that it thus would be advantageous to refuse battle.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=138}} Indeed, it had originally been the Dutch intention to defeat the English first to free the way for the transport fleet \u2013 though they too, to lower the cost of the invasion, had not activated any heavier ships \u2013 but because it was now so late in the season and conditions on board deteriorated rapidly, they decided to sail in convoy and, if possible, avoid battle.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|p=291}}\n\n===Crossing and landing===\n[[File:Het oorlogsschip 'Brielle' op de Maas voor Rotterdam - The warship 'Brielle' on the Maas before Rotterdam (Ludolf Backhuysen, 1689).jpg|thumb|William boarding the ''Brill'']]\n\nOn [[Old Style and New Style dates|16/26]] October William boarded his ship, the ''Den Briel'' (''Brill'' in English). His standard was hoisted, displaying the arms of Nassau quartered with those of England. The words ''{{lang|la|Pro Religione et Libertate}}'' (\"For Liberty and [the Protestant] Religion\"), the [[slogan]] of William's ancestor [[William the Silent]] while leading the [[Dutch Revolt]] against Catholic Spain, were shown next to the [[House of Orange]]'s [[motto]], ''{{lang|fr|Je&nbsp;maintiendrai}}'' (\"I&nbsp;will maintain\").{{sfn|Jardine|2008|pp=10\u201311}} William's fleet, which with about 40,000&nbsp;men aboard was roughly twice the size of the [[Spanish Armada]] \u2013 and assembled in a tenth of the time \u2013 consisted of 463&nbsp;ships.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=137}} Among these were 49&nbsp;warships of more than twenty cannon (eight could count as third rates of 60\u201368&nbsp;cannon, nine were frigates), 28&nbsp;[[galliot]]s, nine&nbsp;[[fireships]], 76&nbsp;[[fluyt]]s to carry the soldiers, 120 small transports to carry five&nbsp;thousand horses, about seventy supply vessels and sixty fishing vessels serving as [[landing craft]].{{sfn|Western|1972|p=260}}{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|p=289}} Most of the warships had been provided by the [[Admiralty of Amsterdam]]. On 19/29 October William's fleet departed from [[Hellevoetsluis]]. The fleet was approximately halfway between the Republic and England when the wind changed to the northwest and a gale scattered the fleet, with the ''Brill'' returning to Hellevoetsluis on 21/31 October. Despite suffering from sea-sickness William refused to go ashore and the fleet reassembled, having lost only one ship that grounded,{{sfn|Macaulay|1889|p=561}} though about a thousand crippled horses had been thrown into the sea.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|p=290}} Press reports were released that deliberately exaggerated the damage and claimed the expedition would be postponed till the spring.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|pp=290\u201391}} English naval command now considered to try blockading Hellevoetsluis but decided against it because it was feared that the English fleet would founder on the Dutch coast, a dangerous [[lee shore]] for a blocking force, by the stormy weather.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1989|loc=}} {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\nTaking advantage of a wind again turned to the east, resupplied and re-equipped with new horses, the invasion fleet departed again on 1/11&nbsp;November and sailed north in the direction of [[Harwich]] where Bentinck had a landing site prepared. The fleet changed course to the south however when the wind turned more to the north; it has been suggested that the initial move to the north was a feint and indeed James diverted some of his forces in that direction.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|pp=290\u201391}} Thus they passed twice in sight of the English fleet, which was unable to intercept because of the adverse wind and an unfavourable tide.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=139}} On 3/13 November the invasion fleet entered the [[English Channel]] through the [[Strait of Dover]] in an enormous square formation, 25&nbsp;ships deep, the right and left of the fleet saluting Dover and Calais simultaneously, to show off its size. The troops were lined up on deck, firing musket volleys, with full colours flying and the [[military band]]s playing. [[Rapin de Thoyras]], who was on board one of the ships, described it as the most magnificent and affecting spectacle that was ever seen by human eyes. William intended to land at [[Torbay]] but due to fog the fleet sailed past it by mistake. The wind made a return impossible and Plymouth was unsuitable as it had a garrison. At this point, with the English fleet in pursuit, Russell told Burnet: \"You may go to prayers, Doctor. All is over\". At that moment however the wind changed and the fog lifted, enabling the fleet to sail into Torbay, near [[Brixham]], Devon. William came ashore on 5/15&nbsp;November.{{sfn|Macaulay|1889|pp=563\u201364}} When Burnet was ashore he hastened to William and eagerly enquired what William now intended to do. William regarded the interference in military matters by non-military personnel with disgust but he was in good humour at this moment and responded with a delicate reproof: \"Well, Doctor, what do you think of [[predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] now?\"{{sfn|Macaulay|1889|p=565}} The English squadron under [[George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth|Lord Dartmouth]] was forced by the same change in wind to shelter in Portsmouth harbour.{{sfn|Macaulay|1889|p=565}} During the next two days William's army disembarked in calm weather.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=139}}\n\nWilliam brought over 11,212 horse and foot.

Thus he landed far away from James's army, expecting that his English allies would take the initiative in acting against James while he ensured his own protection against potential attacks. William was prepared to wait; he had paid his troops in advance for a three-month campaign. A slow advance, apart from being necessitated by heavy rainfall anyway, had the added benefit of not over-extending the supply lines; the Dutch troops were under strict orders not even to forage, for fear that this would degenerate into plundering, which would alienate the population.\n\nOn 9 November (Julian calendar) William took [[Exeter]] after the magistrates had fled the city, entering on a white [[palfrey]], with the two hundred [[Black people|black]] men forming a guard of honour, dressed in white, with turbans and feathers.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=16}} In the South support from the local gentry was disappointingly limited,{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=15}} but from 12 November, in the North, many nobles began to declare for William, as they had promised, often by a public reading of the ''Declaration''.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=32}} In [[Yorkshire]], printer John White started to print the same document for a more widespread distribution.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=31}} However, in the first weeks most people carefully avoided taking sides; as a whole the nation neither rallied behind its king, nor welcomed William, but passively awaited the outcome of events. In general, the mood was one of confusion, mutual distrust and depression.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=15}}\n\n==The collapse of James's rule==\nJames refused a French offer to send an expeditionary force, fearing that it would cost him domestic support. He tried to bring the Tories to his side by making concessions but failed because he still refused to endorse the Test Act. His forward forces had gathered at [[Salisbury]], and James went to join them on 19 November with his main force, having a total strength of about 19,000. Amid anti-Catholic rioting in London, it rapidly became apparent that the troops were not eager to fight, and the loyalty of many of James' commanders was doubtful; he had been informed of the conspiracy within the army as early as September, but for unknown reasons had refused to arrest the officers involved. Some have argued, however, that if James had been more resolute, the army would have fought and fought well.<ref>{{harvnb|Childs|1980|loc=}} {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe first blood was shed at about this time in a [[Wincanton Skirmish|skirmish at Wincanton]], Somerset, where Royalist troops under [[Patrick Sarsfield]] retreated after defeating a small party of scouts; the total body count on both sides came to about fifteen. In Salisbury, after hearing that some officers had deserted, among them [[Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon|Lord Cornbury]], a worried James was overcome by a serious nose-bleed that he interpreted as an evil [[omen]] indicating that he should order his army to retreat, which the supreme army commander, the [[Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham|Earl of Feversham]], also advised on 23 November. The next day, [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Lord Churchill]], one of James' chief commanders, deserted to William.{{efn|[[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill]], later the [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|1st Duke of Marlborough]], was the pre-eminent British general of his generation. {{quote|I once heard the [[Duke of Wellington]] asked whether he thought Napoleon or Marlborough the greater general. \"It is difficult to answer that\", he replied. \"I used always to say that the presence of Napoleon at a battle was equal to a reinforcement of 40,000 men.

On 4 December he was at [[Amesbury]], and was received by the mayor of [[Salisbury]];{{sfn|Information Services}} three days later they had reached [[Hungerford]], where the following day they met with the King's Commissioners to negotiate. James offered free elections and a general amnesty for the rebels. In reality, by that point James was simply playing for time, having already decided to flee the country. He feared that his English enemies would insist on his execution and that William would give in to their demands. Convinced that his army was unreliable, he sent orders to disband it. On 9 December, the two sides fought a second engagement with the [[Battle of Reading (1688)|Battle of Reading]], a defeat for the King's men.\n\nIn December, there was anti-Catholic rioting in Bristol, Bury St. Edmunds, Hereford, York, Cambridge, and Shropshire. On 9 December a Protestant mob stormed [[Dover Castle]], where the Catholic Sir Edward Hales was governor, and seized it. On 8 December William met at last with James's representatives; he agreed to James's proposals but also demanded that all Catholics be immediately dismissed from state functions and that England pay for the Dutch military expenses. He received no reply, however.\n\n===Departure of King and Queen===\nIn the night of 9/10 December, the Queen and the Prince of Wales fled for France. The next day saw James's attempt to escape, the King dropping the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] in the [[Thames]] along the way, as no lawful Parliament could be summoned without it.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=17}} However, he was captured on 11 December by fishermen in [[Faversham]] opposite [[Sheerness]], the town on the [[Isle of Sheppey]]. On the same day, 27&nbsp;[[Lords Spiritual]] and [[Lords Temporal|Temporal]], forming a [[provisional government]], decided to ask William to restore order but at the same time asked the king to return to London to reach an agreement with his son-in-law. It was presided over initially by [[William Sancroft]], Archbishop of Canterbury and, after it was learned that James was still in England, by [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=2409|page=1 |date=13 December 1688}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/historyenglandf08unkngoog|title=The History of England from the Accession of James the Second|first=Hannah More Macaulay Trevelyan|last=Thomas Babington Macaulay Macaulay|date=21 September 1872|publisher=Longmans, Green, and co.|accessdate=21 September 2018|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> On the night of 11 December there were riots and lootings of the houses of Catholics and several foreign embassies of Catholic countries in London. The following night a mass panic gripped London during what was later termed the [[Irish night]]. False rumours of an impending Irish army attack on London circulated in the capital, and a mob of over 100,000 assembled ready to defend the city.\n\nUpon returning to London on 16 December, James was welcomed by cheering crowds. He took heart at this and attempted to recommence government, even presiding over a meeting of the [[Privy Council]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=2410|page=2 |date=17 December 1688}}</ref><ref group=lower-alpha>Those in attendance were [[William Hamilton, Duke of Hamilton]], [[William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608\u20131697)|William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven]], [[George Berkeley, 1st Earl of Berkeley]], [[Charles Middleton, 2nd Earl of Middleton]] ([[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Southern Secretary]]), [[Richard Graham, 1st Viscount Preston]] ([[Lord President of the Council]] and [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department|Northern Secretary]]), [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]] (Chamberlain to the Queen and [[Lords Commissioners of the Treasury|Treasury Commissioner]]), [[John Trevor (speaker)|John Trevor]], Master of the Rolls and [[Silius Titus]]</ref>  He sent the [[Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham|Earl of Feversham]] to William to arrange for a personal meeting to continue negotiations. Now it became evident that William had no longer any desire to keep James in power in England. He was extremely dismayed by the arrival of Lord Feversham. He refused the suggestion that he simply arrest James because this would violate his own declarations and burden his relationship with his wife. In the end it was decided that he should exploit James's fears; the three original commissioners were sent back to James with the message that William felt he could no longer guarantee the king's well-being and that James for his own safety had better leave London for [[Ham, London|Ham]].\n\nWilliam at the same time ordered all English troops to depart from the capital, while his forces entered on 17 December; no local forces were allowed within a twenty-mile radius until the spring of 1690. Already the English navy had declared for William. James, by his own choice, went under Dutch protective guard to [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in Kent on 18 December, just as William entered London, cheered by crowds dressed in orange ribbons or waving, lavishly distributed, oranges.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=19}} The Dutch officers had been ordered that \"if he [James] wanted to leave, they should not prevent him, but allow him to gently slip through\".<ref>''Journaal van Constantijn Huygens'', i, 62</ref> James then left for France on 23 December after having received a request from his wife to join her, even though his followers urged him to stay. The lax guard on James and the decision to allow him so near the coast indicate that William may have hoped that a successful flight would avoid the difficulty of deciding what to do with him, especially with the memory of the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] still strong. By fleeing, James ultimately helped resolve the awkward question of whether he was still the legal king or not, having created according to many a situation of [[interregnum]].{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=17}}\n\n==William and Mary made joint monarchs==\n[[File:William and Mary.jpg|thumb|[[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] reigned together for five years. William reigned on his own following Mary's death in 1694.]]\n\nOn 28 December, William took over the provisional government by appointment of the peers of the realm, as was the legal right of the latter in circumstances when the king was incapacitated, and, on the advice of his Whig allies, summoned an assembly of all the surviving members of parliament of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s reign, thus sidelining the Tories of the [[Loyal Parliament]] of 1685. This assembly called for a chosen [[Convention Parliament (1689)|English Convention Parliament]], elected on 5 January 1689 [[New Style|NS]],<ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/> which convened on 22 January. William did not intervene in the election that followed. This elected body consisted of 513&nbsp;members, 341 of whom had been elected before, 238 having been members of at least one [[Exclusion Bill Parliament]], but only 193 having been elected in 1685.{{sfn|Horwitz|1977|p=9}} The name \"Convention\" was chosen because only the king could call a Parliament, although as William had been appointed ''de facto'' regent by the peers the Convention could be argued to be, strictly speaking, a lawful Parliament.\n\nAlthough James had fled the country, he still had many followers, and William feared that the king might return, relegating William to the role of a mere regent, an outcome which was unacceptable to him. On 30 December, William, speaking to the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]], threatened to leave England \"if King James came again\" and determined to go back to the Netherlands \"if they went about to make him Regent\".<ref>{{harvnb|Beddard|1988|p=65}} cites: {{citation|last=Foxcroft |first=H.

The radical Whigs in the Lower House proposed to elect William as a king (meaning that his power would be derived from the people); the moderates wanted an [[acclamation]] of William and Mary together; the Tories wanted to make him regent or only acclaim Mary as queen. On 28 January a committee of the whole [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] promptly decided by acclamation that James had broken \"the original contract\"; had \"abdicated the government\"; and had left the throne \"vacant\".{{sfn|Horwitz|1977|pp=9\u201310}} The House of Lords wished to amend this, however, as many were still loyal to James and believed in the Anglican doctrine of non-resistance. The Lords rejected the proposal for a regency in James's name by 51 to 48 on 2 February. The Lords also substituted the word \"abdicated\" for \"deserted\" and removed the \"vacancy\" clause. The Lords voted against proclaiming William and Mary monarchs by 52 to 47. On 4 February the Lords reaffirmed their amendments to the Commons's resolution by 55 to 51 and 54 to 53.{{sfn|Horwitz|1977|p=10}} On 5 February the Commons voted 282 to 151 for maintaining the original wording of the resolution. The next day, the two Houses entered into a conference but failed to resolve the matter. William in private conversation (with Halifax, Danby, Shrewsbury, Lord Winchester and Lord Mordaunt) made it clear that they could either accept him as king or deal with the Whigs without his military presence, for then he would leave for the Republic. But he let it be known that he was happy for Mary to be nominal monarch and preference in the succession given to Anne's children over his by a subsequent marriage. Anne declared that she would temporarily waive her right to the crown should Mary die before William, and Mary refused to be made queen without William as king. The Lords on 6 February now accepted the words \"abdication\" and \"vacancy\" and Lord Winchester's motion to appoint William and Mary monarchs.{{sfn|Horwitz|1977|p=11}} Generally there was a great fear that the situation might deteriorate into a civil war.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=26}}\n\n[[File:Atlas Van der Hagen-KW1049B11 023-Alle de bijsondere en particuliere Ceremonien, geschied in en omtrent de Krooning WILLIAM de III. en MARIA de II.jpeg|thumb|William of Orange and Mary crowned as King and Queen of England in 1689]]\n===The Bill of Rights===\n{{Main article|Bill of Rights 1689}}\nThe proposal to draw up a statement of rights and liberties and James's invasion of them was first made on 29 January in the Commons, with members arguing that the House \"can not answer it to the nation or Prince of Orange till we declare what are the rights invaded\" and that William \"cannot take it ill if we make conditions to secure ourselves for the future\" to \"do justice to those who sent us hither\". On 2 February a committee specially convened reported to the Commons 23&nbsp;Heads of Grievances, which the Commons approved and added some of their own. However, on 4 February the Commons decided to instruct the committee to differentiate between \"such of the general heads, as are introductory of new laws, from those that are declaratory of ancient rights\". On 7 February the Commons approved this revised Declaration of Right, and on 8 February instructed the committee to put into a single text the Declaration (with the heads which were \"introductory of new laws\" removed), the resolution of 28 January and the Lords' proposal for a revised oath of allegiance. It passed the Commons without division.{{sfn|Horwitz|1977|p=12}}\n\nThe Declaration of Right was in December 1689 enacted in an Act of Parliament, the [[Bill of Rights 1689]]. It listed twelve of James's policies by which James designed to \"endeavour to subvert and extirpate the protestant religion, and the laws and liberties of this kingdom\".{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=26}} These were:\n* by assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and suspending of laws;\n* by prosecuting the Seven Bishops;\n* by establishing of the court of commissioners for ecclesiastical causes;\n* by levying money for the crown by pretence of prerogative than the same was granted by Parliament;\n* by raising and maintaining a standing army in peacetime without the consent of Parliament;\n* by disarming Protestants and arming Catholics contrary to law;\n* by violating the election of members to serve in Parliament;\n* by prosecuting in the King's Bench for matters cognisable only in Parliament and \"divers other arbitrary and illegal courses\";\n* by employing unqualified persons to serve on juries;\n* by requiring an excessive bail for persons committed in criminal cases;\n* by imposing excessive fines and \"illegal and cruel punishments inflicted\";\n* by making \"several grants and promises made of fines and forfeitures before any conviction or judgment against the person, upon whom the same were to be levied\".{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=27}}\n\nThe Bill of Rights also vindicated and asserted the nation's \"ancient rights and liberties\" by declaring:\n* the pretended power to dispense with or suspend Acts of Parliament is illegal;\n* the commission for ecclesiastical causes is illegal;\n* levying money without the consent of Parliament is illegal;\n* it is the right of the subject to petition the king and prosecutions for petitioning are illegal;\n* maintaining a standing army in peacetime without the consent of Parliament is illegal;\n* Protestant subjects \"may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions, and allowed by law\";\n* the election of members of Parliament ought to be free;\n* that freedom of speech and debates in Parliament \"ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament\";\n* [[excessive bail]] and fines not required and \"[[cruel and unusual punishment]]s\" not to be inflicted;\n* jurors in high treason trials ought to be freeholders;\n* that promises of fines and forfeitures before conviction are illegal;\n* that Parliament ought to be held frequently.{{sfn|Williams|1960|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nOn 13 February the clerk of the House of Lords read the Declaration of Right, and Halifax, in the name of all the estates of the realm, asked William and Mary to accept the throne. William replied for his wife and himself: \"We thankfully accept what you have offered us\". They then went in procession to the great gate at Whitehall. The [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter King at Arms]] proclaimed them King and Queen of England, [[English claims to the French throne|France]] and Ireland, whereupon they adjourned to the Chapel Royal, with Compton preaching the sermon.{{sfn|Carpenter|1956|pp=145\u201346}} They were crowned on 11 April, swearing an oath to uphold the laws made by Parliament. The [[Coronation Oath Act 1688]] had provided a new coronation oath, whereby the monarchs were to \"solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of this kingdom of England, and the dominions thereunto belonging, according to the statutes in parliament agreed on, and the laws and customs of the same\". They were also to maintain the laws of God, the true profession of the Gospel, and the Protestant Reformed faith established by law.{{sfn|Williams|1960|pp=37\u201339}}\n\n===The other kingdoms===\n{{Main article|Glorious Revolution in Scotland}}\nAlthough their succession to the English throne was relatively peaceful, much blood would be shed before William's authority was accepted in Ireland and Scotland. In Scotland there had been no serious support for the rebellion; but, when James fled for France, most members of the [[Scottish Privy Council]] went to London to offer their services to William. On 7 January they asked William to take over the responsibilities of government. On 14 March a [[Convention of Estates (1689)|Scottish Convention]] convened in [[Edinburgh]], dominated by the [[Presbyterians]] because the Episcopalians continued to support James. There was nevertheless a Jacobite faction, but a letter by James received on 16 March, in which he threatened to punish all who rebelled against him, resulted in his followers leaving the Convention, which then on 4 April decided that the throne of Scotland was vacant. The Convention formulated the ''[[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]]'' and the ''Articles of Grievances''. On 11 May William and Mary accepted the Crown of Scotland; after their acceptance, the ''Claim'' and the '' Articles '' were read aloud, leading to an immediate debate over whether or not an endorsement of these documents was implicit in that acceptance.\n\nIn Ireland there was no equivalent of the English or Scottish Convention and William had to conquer Ireland by [[Williamite War in Ireland|force]]. The English Convention presumed to legislate for Ireland as well, and the Declaration of Right deemed William to be King of Ireland as well as of England.\n\n==Jacobite uprisings==\n{{Main article|Williamite War in Ireland|Jacobite rising of 1689}}\nJames had cultivated support on the fringes of his Three Kingdoms \u2013 in Catholic Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland. Supporters of James, known as ''Jacobites'', were prepared to resist what they saw as an illegal coup by force of arms. The [[Jacobite rising of 1689|first Jacobite rebellion]], an uprising in support of James in Scotland, took place in 1689. It was led by [[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee]], also known as Graham of Claverhouse or Bonnie Dundee, who raised an army from Highland [[clan]]s. In Ireland, [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]] led local Catholics, who had been discriminated against by previous English monarchs, in the conquest of all the fortified places in the kingdom except [[Derry]], and so held the Kingdom for James. James himself landed in Ireland with 6,000&nbsp;French troops to try to regain the throne in the [[Williamite War in Ireland]]. The war raged from 1689 to 1691. James fled Ireland following his defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690, but Jacobite resistance was not ended until after the [[battle of Aughrim]] in 1691, when over half of their army was killed or taken prisoner. The Irish Jacobites surrendered under the conditions of the [[Treaty of Limerick]] on 3 October 1691. England stayed relatively calm throughout, although some English Jacobites fought on James's side in Ireland. Despite the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] victory at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]], the uprising in the [[Scottish Highlands]] was quelled due to the death of its leader, Dundee, and Williamite victories at [[Battle of Dunkeld|Dunkeld]] and [[Battle of Cromdale|Cromdale]], as well as the [[Massacre of Glencoe|Glencoe massacre]] in early 1692. Many, particularly in Ireland and Scotland, continued to see the [[Stuarts]] as the legitimate monarchs of the Three Kingdoms, and there were further Jacobite rebellions in Scotland during the years 1715, 1719 and 1745.\n\n==Anglo-Dutch alliance==\nThough he had carefully avoided making it public, William's main motive in organising the expedition had been the opportunity to bring England into an [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|alliance]] against France. On 9&nbsp;December 1688 he had already asked the States General to send a delegation of three to negotiate the conditions. On 18 February (Julian calendar) he asked the Convention to support the Republic in its war against France; but it refused, only consenting to pay \u00a3600,000 for the continued presence of the Dutch army in England. On 9 March (Gregorian calendar) the States General responded to Louis's earlier [[Nine Years' War|declaration of war]] by declaring war on France in return. On 19&nbsp;April (Julian calendar) the Dutch delegation signed a naval treaty with England. It stipulated that the combined Anglo-Dutch fleet would always be commanded by an Englishman, even when of lower rank; also it specified that the two parties would contribute in the ratio of five English vessels against three Dutch vessels, meaning in practice that the Dutch navy in the future would be smaller than the English. The [[Navigation Acts]] were not repealed. On 18 May the new Parliament allowed William to declare war on France. On 9 September 1689 (Gregorian calendar), William as King of England joined the [[League of Augsburg]] against France.\n\n===The decline of the Dutch Republic===\nHaving England as an ally meant that the military situation of the Republic was strongly improved, but this very fact induced William to be uncompromising in his position towards France. This policy led to a large number of very expensive campaigns which were largely paid for with Dutch funds. In 1712 the Republic was financially exhausted; it withdrew from international politics and was forced to let its fleet deteriorate, making what was by then the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] the dominant maritime power of the world. The Dutch economy, already burdened by the high national debt and concomitant high taxation, suffered from the other European states' [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies, which its weakened fleet was no longer able to resist. To make matters worse, the main Dutch trading and banking houses moved much of their activity from Amsterdam to London after 1688. Between 1688 and 1720, world trade dominance shifted from the Republic to Britain.{{sfn|Vries|Woude|1997|pp=673\u201387}}\n\n==\"Dutch invasion\" hypothesis==\nAfter being revisited by historians in 1988\u2014the third centennial of the event\u2014several researchers have argued that the \"revolution\" was actually a successful Dutch invasion of Britain.<ref>{{harvnb|Vallance|2007}}</ref> The events were unusual because the establishment of a [[constitutional monarchy]] (a de&nbsp;facto republic, see [[Coronation Oath Act 1688]]) and [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] meant that the apparently invading monarchs, legitimate heirs to the throne, were prepared to govern with the English Parliament. It is difficult to classify the entire proceedings of 1687\u201389 but it can be seen that the events occurred in three phases: conspiracy, invasion by Dutch forces and \"Glorious Revolution\". It has been argued that the invasion aspect had been downplayed as a result of a combination of British pride and successful Dutch propaganda, trying to depict the course of events as a largely internal English affair.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=27}}\n\nAs the invitation was initiated by figures who had little influence themselves, the legacy of the Glorious Revolution has been described as a successful propaganda act by William to cover up and justify his successful invasion.<ref>L. Schwoerer, \"Propaganda in the Revolution of 1688-89\" ''The American Historical Review'', vol 82 no 4, 1977</ref>  The claim that William was fighting for the Protestant cause in England was used to great effect to disguise the military, cultural and political impact that the Dutch regime had on England at the time.\n\n==Impact==\nThe overthrow of James was hailed at the time and ever since as the \"Glorious Revolution\". [[Edmund Burke]] set the tone for over two centuries of historiographical analysis when he proclaimed that:\n:The Revolution was made to preserve our ancient indisputable laws and liberties, and that ancient constitution of government which is our only security for law and liberty.{{sfn|Goodlad|2007}}{{sfn|Dekrey|2008|pp=738\u201373}}\n\nMany historians have endorsed Burke's view, including Macaulay (1848) and more recently John Morrill, who captured the consensus of contemporary historiography well when he declared that \"the Sensible Revolution of 1688\u201389 was a conservative Revolution\". On the other hand, [[Steven Pincus]] (2009) argues that it was momentous especially when looking at the alternative that James was trying to enact \u2013 a powerful centralised autocratic state, using French-style \"state-building\". England's role in Europe and the country's political economy in the 17th&nbsp;century refutes the view of many late-20th-century historians that nothing revolutionary occurred during the Glorious Revolution of 1688\u201389. Pincus says it was not a placid turn of events. In diplomacy and economics William III transformed the English state's ideology and policies. This occurred not because William III was an outsider who inflicted foreign notions on England but because foreign affairs and political economy were at the core of the English revolutionaries' agenda. The revolution of 1688\u201389 cannot be fathomed in isolation. It would have been inconceivable without the changes resulting from the events of the 1640s and 1650s. Indeed, the ideas accompanying the Glorious Revolution were rooted in the mid-century upheavals. Thus, the 17th&nbsp;century was a century of revolution in England, deserving of the same scholarly attention that 'modern' revolutions attract.<ref name=\"Pincus 2009 loc\">{{harvnb|Pincus|2009|loc=}} {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\nJames II tried building a powerful militarised state on the [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] assumption that the world's wealth was necessarily finite and empires were created by taking land from other states. The [[East India Company]] was thus an ideal tool to create a vast new English imperial dominion by warring with the Dutch and the Mogul Empire in India. After 1689 came an alternative understanding of economics, which saw Britain as a commercial rather than an agrarian society. The proponents of this view, most famously [[Adam Smith]] in 1776, argued that wealth was created by human endeavour and was thus potentially infinite.<ref name=\"Pincus 2009 loc\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Monarchism |expanded=history}}\n\nThe Glorious Revolution of 1688 is considered by some as being one of the most important events in the long evolution of the respective powers of Parliament and the Crown in England. With the passage of the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]], it stamped out once and for all any possibility of a Catholic monarchy, and ended moves towards [[absolute monarchy]] in the British kingdoms by circumscribing the monarch's powers. These powers were greatly restricted; he or she could no longer suspend laws, levy taxes, make royal appointments, or maintain a standing army during peacetime without Parliament's permission \u2013 to this day the Army is known as the \"British Army\" not the \"Royal Army\" as it is, in some sense, Parliament's Army and not that of the King. (This is, however, a complex issue, as the Crown remains the source of all executive authority in the British army, with legal implications for unlawful orders etc.).<ref>{{harvnb|Windeyer|1938|loc=}} {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref> Since 1689, government under a system of [[constitutional monarchy]] in England, and later the United Kingdom, has been uninterrupted. Since then, Parliament's power has steadily increased while the Crown's has steadily declined. Unlike in the [[English civil war]] of the mid-seventeenth century, the \"Glorious Revolution\" did not involve the masses of ordinary people in England (the majority of the bloodshed occurred in Ireland). This fact has led many historians, including Stephen Webb,{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=166}} to suggest that, in England at least, the events more closely resemble a coup d'\u00e9tat than a social revolution.<ref group=lower-alpha>The importance of the event has divided historians ever since Friedrich Engels judged it \"a relatively puny event\" ({{harvnb|Engels|1997|p=269}}).</ref> This view of events does not contradict what was originally meant by \"revolution\": the coming round of an old system of values in a circular motion, back to its original position, as Britain's constitution was reasserted, rather than formed anew.{{sfn|Mitchell|2009|loc=xvi, xviii, xix}}{{sfn|Black|MacRaid|2000|pp=7, 8}}\n\nPrior to his arrival in England, the new king [[William III of England]] was not [[Church of England|Anglican]], but rather was a member of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. Consequently, as a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] he was now in the unenviable position of being the head of the Church of England, while technically being a [[Nonconformist]]. This was, however, not his main motive for promoting religious toleration. More important in that respect was the need to keep happy his Catholic allies<ref group=lower-alpha>i.e. Spain and the German Emperor</ref> in the coming struggle with Louis&nbsp;XIV.{{sfn|Israel|2003|pp=137\u201338}} Though he had promised legal toleration for Catholics in his ''Declaration'' of October 1688, he was ultimately unsuccessful in this respect, due to opposition by the Tories in the new Parliament.{{sfn|Israel|2003|pp=20}} The Revolution led to the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration of 1689]], which granted toleration to [[Nonconformist|Nonconformist Protestants]], but not to Catholics. [[Catholic emancipation]] would be delayed for 140 years.\n\nThe [[Williamite War in Ireland]] can be seen as the source of later conflict, including [[The Troubles]] of recent times. The [[Williamite]] victory in Ireland is still commemorated by the [[Orange Order]] for preserving British and Protestant dominance in the country.\n\nIn North America, the Glorious Revolution precipitated the [[1689 Boston revolt]] in which a well-organised \"mob\" of provincial militia and citizens successfully deposed the hated governor [[Edmund Andros]], which has been seen as a precedent for the [[American War of Independence]] a century later.  In New York, [[Leisler's Rebellion]] caused the colonial administrator, [[Francis Nicholson]], to flee to England.  A third event, Maryland's [[Protestant Revolution (Maryland)|Protestant Rebellion]] was directed against the proprietary government, seen as Catholic-dominated.\n\n[[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]]'s account of the Revolution in ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James the Second]]'' exemplifies its semi-mystical significance to later generations.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Civil liberties in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Financial Revolution]]\n* [[History of liberalism]]\n* [[Quo warranto]]\n* [[List of deserters from James II to William of Orange]]\n* [[London, Quo Warranto Judgment Reversed Act 1689]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha|refs=<!--\n<ref name=Celtic-names>Name of the Glorious Revolution in the languages of Britain and Ireland:\n* {{lang-ga|An R\u00e9abhl\u00f3id Ghl\u00f3rmhar}}\n* {{lang-sco|Gloryws Revolution}}\n* {{lang-gd|R\u00e8abhlaid Ghl\u00f2rmhor}}\n* {{lang-cy|Chwyldro Gogoneddus}}\n</ref>-->\n\n<ref name=cal>In this article \"New Style\" means the start of year is adjusted to 1 January.

''Gaelic'', by itself, is sometimes used to refer to Scottish Gaelic, especially in Scotland, and so it is ambiguous.\n\nThe [[endonym]]s (''{{lang|ga|Gaeilge}}'', ''{{lang|ga|Gaelic}}'' and ''{{lang|ga|Gaolainn}}'' in Irish, ''{{lang|gv|Gaelg}}'' in Manx and ''{{Lang|gd|G\u00e0idhlig}}'' in Scottish Gaelic) are derived from Old Irish ''Go\u00eddelc'', which in turn is derived from [[Old Welsh]] ''{{lang|owl|Guoidel}}'' meaning \"pirate, raider\".<ref>Koch, John.

The mainstream view is that D\u00e1l Riata was founded by Irish migrants, but this is not universally accepted.

The forms of this speech are very close, and often identical, to the forms of [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] recorded before and during the [[Roman Empire]]. The next stage, [[Old Irish]], is found in [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] (i.e. annotations) to [[Latin]] [[manuscript]]s\u2014mainly religious and grammatical\u2014from the 6th to the 10th century, as well as in archaic texts copied or recorded in [[Middle Irish]] texts.

Manx orthography, which was introduced in the 16th and 17th centuries, was based on English and Welsh practice and so never formed part of this literary standard.\n\n==Irish==\n{{Main article|Irish language}}\nIrish is one of the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s two official languages along with [[English language|English]]. Historically the predominant language of the island, it is now mostly spoken in parts of the south, west, and northwest. The legally defined Irish-speaking areas are called the {{lang|ga|[[Gaeltacht]]}}; all government institutions of the Republic, in particular the [[Oireachtas|parliament]] (''{{lang|ga|Oireachtas}}''), its [[Seanad \u00c9ireann|upper house]] (''{{lang|ga|Seanad}}'') and [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|lower house]] (''{{lang|ga|D\u00e1il}}''), and the [[Taoiseach|prime minister]] (''{{lang|ga|Taoiseach}}'') are officially named in this language, even in English. At present, the {{lang|ga|Gaeltachta\u00ed}} are primarily found in Counties [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]], [[County Mayo|Mayo]], [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Kerry|Kerry]], and, to a lesser extent, in [[County Waterford|Waterford]] and [[County Meath|Meath]]. In the Republic of Ireland 1,774,437 (41.4% of the population aged three years and over) regard themselves as able to speak Irish.<ref name=csoi2011>[http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=CDD31&PLanguage=0 Central Statistics Office Ireland]</ref> Of these, 77,185 (1.8%) speak Irish on a daily basis outside school.<ref name=\"csoi2011\"/> Irish is also undergoing a revival in [[Northern Ireland]] and has been accorded some legal status there under the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]] but its official usage remains divisive among a predominantly British population.  The 2001 census in [[Irish language in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland showed]] that 167,487 (10.4%) people \"had some knowledge of Irish\". Combined, this means that around one in three people ({{circa|1.8 million}}) on the island of Ireland can understand Irish to some extent, although a large percentage of these do not speak it fluently.  The census figures do not take into account those Irish who have emigrated, and it has been estimated (rightly or wrongly) that there are more native speakers of Irish in Britain, the US, Australia, and other parts of the world than there are in Ireland itself.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nDespite the ascent in Ireland of the English and Anglicised ruling classes following the 1607 [[Flight of the Earls]] (and the disappearance of much of the Gaelic nobility), Irish was spoken by the majority of the population until the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 1840s. Disproportionately affecting the classes among whom Irish was the primary spoken language, famine and emigration precipitated a steep decline in native speakers which only recently has begun to reverse.<ref>{{cite web |last=Coleman |first=Karen |title=Gaelic enjoys a revival in Ireland |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1110628.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |accessdate=27 November 2012 |date=10 January 2001 }}</ref>\n\nThe Irish language has been recognised as an official and working language of the [[European Union]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/official-languages-eu-0_en|title=Official languages of the EU - Education and training - European Commission|website=Education and training|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref> Ireland's national language was the twenty-third to be given such recognition by the EU and previously had the status of a treaty language.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/irish-becomes-the-23rd-official-language-of-eu-430615.html|title=Irish becomes the 23rd official language of EU|date=2007-01-03|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Scottish Gaelic==\n[[File:Scots lang-en.svg|thumb|Linguistic division in early twelfth century Scotland:\n{{legend|#0fe3e3|Gaelic speaking}}\n{{legend|#eb82df|[[Norse\u2013Gaels|Norse-Gaelic]] zone, characterized by the use of both languages}}\n{{legend|#eed4e0|[[English language|English]]-speaking zone}}\n{{legend|#0ff183|[[Cumbric]] may have survived in this zone; more realistically a mixture of Cumbric, Gaelic (west) and English (east)}}\n]]\n\n{{Main article|Scottish Gaelic}}\nSome people in the north and west of mainland Scotland and most people in the [[Hebrides]] still speak Scottish Gaelic, but  the language has been in decline.  There are now believed to be approximately 60,000 native speakers of Scottish Gaelic in [[Scotland]], plus around 1,000 speakers of the [[Canadian Gaelic]] dialect in [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nIts historical range was much larger. For example, it was the everyday language of most of the rest of the [[Scottish Highlands]] until little more than a century ago. [[Galloway]] was once also a Gaelic-speaking region, but the [[Galwegian Gaelic|Galwegian dialect]] has been extinct there for approximately three centuries. It is believed to have been home to dialects that were transitional between Scottish Gaelic and the two other Goidelic languages. While Gaelic was spoken across the [[Scottish Borders]] and [[Lothian]] during the early [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages|High Middle Ages]] it does not seem to have been spoken by the majority and was likely the language of the ruling elite, land-owners and religious clerics. Some other parts of the [[Scottish Lowlands]] spoke [[Cumbric]], and others [[Scots language|Scots Inglis]], the only exceptions being the [[Northern Isles]] of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] where [[Norn language|Norse]] was spoken.\n\nScotland takes its name from the Latin word for 'Gael', ''{{lang|la|Scotus}}'', plural ''{{lang|la|Scoti}}'' (of uncertain etymology).<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50216347 ''Oxford English Dictionary'']: Scot, ''n''.<sup>1</sup>. The source of the late Latin word is obscure. There is no evidence that it represents the native name of any Gaelic-speaking people (the Irish ''Scot'', an Irishman, pl. ''Scuit'', appears to be a learned word from Latin), nor does it exist in Welsh, though Welshmen in writing Latin have from the earliest times used ''Scoti'' as the rendering of ''{{lang|cy|Gwyddel}}'' (Gaels). [...]  Retrieved 11 October 2010</ref>  ''Scotland'' originally meant ''Land of the Gaels'' in a cultural and social sense. Until late in the 15th century, ''Scottis'' in [[Scottish English]] (or ''Scots Inglis'') was used to refer only to Gaelic, and the speakers of this language who were identified  as ''Scots''. As the ruling elite became Scots Inglis/English-speaking, ''Scottis'' was gradually associated with the land rather than the people, and the word ''Erse'' ('Irish') was gradually used more and more as an act of culturo-political disassociation with an overt implication that the language was not really Scottish, and therefore foreign. This was something of a propaganda label, as Gaelic has been in Scotland for at least as long as English, if not longer.\n\nIn the early 16th century the dialects of northern [[Middle English]], also known as [[Early Scots]], which had developed in [[Lothian]] and had come to be spoken elsewhere in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] themselves later appropriated the name [[Scots language|Scots]]. By the 17th century Gaelic speakers were restricted largely to the Highlands and the Hebrides. Furthermore, the culturally repressive measures taken against the rebellious Highland communities by [[The Crown]] following the second [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite Rebellion of 1746]] caused still further decline in the language's use \u2014 to a large extent by enforced emigration (e.g. the [[Highland Clearances]]). Even more decline followed in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThe [[Scottish Parliament]] has afforded the language a secure statutory status and \"equal respect\" (but not full equality in legal status under [[Scots law]])<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4467769.stm |title=MSPs rule against Gaelic equality |date=21 April 2005 |work=[[BBC News Online]] }}</ref> with English, sparking hopes that Scottish Gaelic can be saved from extinction and perhaps even revitalised.\n\n==Manx==\n{{Main article|Manx language}}\nLong the everyday language of most of the [[Isle of Man]], Manx began to decline sharply in the 19th century. The last monolingual Manx speakers are believed to have died around the middle of the 19th century; in 1874 around 30% of the population were estimated to speak Manx, decreasing to 9.1% in 1901 and 1.1% in 1921.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Fourth International Conference on Minority Languages |edition=Vol. II: Western and Eastern European Papers |editor=D.

These systems believed that the material world is created by an emanation of the highest God, trapping the [[divine spark]] within the human body. This divine spark could be liberated by ''[[gnosis]]''. Some of the core teachings include the following:\n\n# All matter is evil, and the non-material, spirit-realm is good.\n# There is an unknowable God, who gave rise to many lesser spirit beings called Aeons.\n# One evil, lower spirit being is the creator who made the universe.\n# Gnosticism does not deal with \"sin\", only ignorance.\n# To achieve salvation, one needs to get in touch with secret knowledge.\n\nThe Gnostic ideas and systems flourished in the Mediterranean world in the second century AD, in conjunction with and influenced by the early Christian movements and [[Middle Platonism]]. After the second century, a decline set in, but Gnosticism persisted throughout the centuries as an undercurrent of western culture, remanifesting with the [[Renaissance]] as [[Western esotericism]], taking prominence with modern [[spirituality]]. In the Persian Empire, Gnosticism spread as far as China with [[Manicheism]], while [[Mandaeism]] is still alive in Iraq.\n\nA major question in scholarly research is the qualification of Gnosticism, based on the study of its texts, as either an interreligious phenomenon or as an independent religion.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Gnosis}}\n''Gnosis'' refers to knowledge based on personal experience or perception. In a religious context, ''gnosis'' is [[Mysticism|mystical]] or esoteric [[knowledge]] based on direct participation with the divine.

Some Valentinian Gnostics supposed that Christ took on an angelic nature that he might be the Saviour of angels. The author of the ''Testament of Solomon'' held Christ to be a particularly effective \"thwarting\" angel in the exorcism of demons. The author of ''De Centesima'' and Epiphanius\u2019 \"Ebionites\" held Christ to have been the highest and most important of the first created archangels, a view similar in many respects to Hermas\u2019 equation of Christ with Michael.

The Sethian hidden transcendent God is, by contrast, defined through [[negative theology]]: he is immovable, invisible, intangible, ineffable; commonly, \"he\" is seen as being [[hermaphroditic]], a potent symbol for being, as it were, \"all-containing\". In the [[Apocryphon of John]], this god is good in that it bestows goodness. After the apophatic statements, the process of the Divine in action are used to describe the effect of such a god.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}<!--The verb does not match the subject (\"process\").

The heavenly pleroma is the center of divine life, a region of light \"above\" (the term is not to be understood spatially) our world, occupied by spiritual beings such as aeons (eternal beings) and sometimes archons. Jesus is interpreted as an intermediary aeon who was sent from the pleroma, with whose aid humanity can recover the lost knowledge of the divine origins of humanity. The term is thus a central element of Gnostic [[cosmology]].\n\nPleroma is also used in the general Greek language, and is used by the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox church]] in this general form, since the word appears in the book of [[Colossians]]. Proponents of the view that [[Gnosticism and the New Testament|Paul was actually a gnostic]], such as [[Elaine Pagels]], view the reference in Colossians as a term that has to be interpreted in a gnostic sense.\n\n===Emanation===\n{{Main|Emanationism}}\nThe Supreme Light or Consciousness descends through a series of stages, gradations, worlds, or hypostases, becoming progressively more material and embodied.

In most if not all versions of the gnostic myth, Sophia births the demiurge, who in turn brings about the creation of materiality. The positive or negative depiction of materiality thus resides a great deal on mythic depictions of Sophia's actions. She is occasionally referred to by the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] equivalent of ''Achamoth'' (this is a feature of Ptolemy's version of the Valentinian gnostic myth).

The gnostic demiurge bears resemblance to figures in Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. In ''Timaeus'', the ''demiourg\u00f3s'' is a central figure, a benevolent creator of the universe who works to make the universe as benevolent as the limitations of matter will allow. In ''The Republic'' the description of the leontomorphic \"desire\" in [[Socrates]]' model of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] bears a resemblance to descriptions of the demiurge as being in the shape of the lion.{{refn|group=note|The relevant passage of ''The Republic'' was found within the [[Nag Hammadi library]],<ref name=\"nhlrepublic\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/plato.html | title = Plato, Republic 588A-589B | publisher = \"The Gnostic Society Library | accessdate = 2009-02-12 }}</ref> wherein a text existed describing the demiurge as a \"lion-faced serpent\".<ref name=\"apocryphon\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/nhl_sbj.htm | title = The Apocryphon of John | publisher = The Gnostic Society Library | accessdate = 2009-02-12 }}</ref>}}}} This figure is also called \"Yaldabaoth\",<ref name=\"apocryphon\" /> [[Samael]] ([[Aramaic]]: ''s\u00e6m\u02bba-\u02bcel'', \"blind god\"), or \"Saklas\" ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]: ''s\u00e6kla'', \"the foolish one\"), who is sometimes ignorant of the superior god, and sometimes opposed to it; thus in the latter case he is correspondingly malevolent. Other names or identifications are [[Ahriman]], [[El (deity)|El]], [[Satan]], and [[Yahweh]].\n\nThe demiurge creates the [[physical universe]] and the physical aspect of [[Human nature|humanity]].<ref name=\"na_demiurge\">{{cite web | title=Demiurge | publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04707b.htm | accessdate=2009-02-12}}</ref> The demiurge typically creates a group of co-actors named [[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]] who preside over the material realm and, in some cases, present obstacles to the soul seeking ascent from it.<ref name=\"apocryphon\" /> The inferiority of the demiurge's creation may be compared to the technical inferiority of a work of art, painting, sculpture, etc. to the thing the art [[mimesis|represents]]. In other cases it takes on a more [[ascetic]] tendency to view material existence negatively, which then becomes more extreme when materiality, including the human body, is perceived as evil and constrictive, a deliberate prison for its inhabitants.\n\nMoral judgements of the demiurge vary from group to group within the broad category of Gnosticism, viewing materiality as being inherently evil, or as merely flawed and as good as its passive constituent matter allows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/demiurge.aspx|title=demiurge|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Archon===\n{{Main|Archon (Gnosticism)}}\nIn late antiquity some variants of Gnosticism used the term archon to refer to several servants of the demiurge.<ref name=hypostasis /> In this context they may be seen as having the roles of the [[angel]]s and demons of the [[Old Testament]].\n\nAccording to [[Origen]]'s ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', a sect called the [[Ophites]] posited the existence of seven archons, beginning with Iadabaoth or Ialdabaoth, who created the six that follow: Iao, [[Sabaoth]], Adonaios, Elaios, Astaphanos, and Horaios.<ref name=\"contra_celsum\">{{cite web | title=Cotra Celsum | author=Origen | publisher=The Gnostic Society Library | url=http://www.gnosis.org/library/orig_cc6.htm | accessdate=13 February 2009}}</ref> Similarly to the [[Mithraic]] [[Chronos|Kronos]] and [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] [[Narasimha]], a form of [[Vishnu]], Ialdabaoth had a head of a lion.<ref name=apocryphon /><ref name=\"mithraic_art\">{{cite web | title=Mithraic Art | url=http://www.public-domain-content.com/books/classic_greece_rome/mom/mom10.shtml | accessdate=2009-12-13 }}</ref><ref name=\"narashimba\">{{cite web | title=Narashimba | publisher=Manas: Indian Religions | url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/Avatars/Narasi.html | accessdate=2009-02-13}}</ref>\n\n===Other concepts===\nOther Gnostic concepts are:{{sfn|Pagels|1975}}\n* [[sarkic]] \u2013 earthly, hidebound, ignorant, uninitiated.

It continued to develop in the Mediterranean and Middle East before and during the 2nd and 3rd centuries, but decline also set in during the third century, due to a growing aversion from the Catholic Church, and the economic and cultural deterioration of the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3519}} Conversion to Islam, and the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), greatly reduced the remaining number of Gnostics throughout the Middle Ages, though a few Mandaean communities still exist. Gnostic and pseudo-gnostic ideas became influential in some of the philosophies of various esoteric [[mystical]] movements of the 19th and 20th centuries in Europe and North America, including some that explicitly identify themselves as revivals or even continuations of earlier gnostic groups.\n\n==Relation with early Christianity==\nDillon notes that Gnosticism raises questions about the development of [[early Christianity]].{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=36}}\n\n===Orthodoxy and heresy===\n{{See also|Diversity in early Christian theology}}\nThe Christian heresiologists, most notably [[Irenaeus]], regarded Gnosticism as a Christian heresy.

Initially, they were hard to distinguish from each other.{{sfn|Perkins|2005|p=3529-3530}}\n\nAccording to Walter Bauer, \"heresies\" may well have been the original form of Christianity in many regions.{{sfn|Bauer|1971}} This theme was further developed by Elaine Pagels,{{sfn|McVey|1981}} who argues that \"the proto-orthodox church found itself in debates with gnostic Christians that helped them to stabilize their own beliefs.\"{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=36}} According to Gilles Quispel, Catholicism arose in response to Gnosticism, establishing safeguards in the form of the [[Episcopal polity|monarchic episcopate]], the [[creed]], and the [[Christian biblical canons|canon]] of holy books.{{sfn|Quispel|2004|p=9}}\n\n===Historical Jesus===\n{{See also|Jesus in comparative mythology|Christ myth theory}}\nThe Gnostic movements may contain information about the historical Jesus, since some texts preserve sayings which show similarities with canonical sayings.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=31-32}} Especially the ''Gospel of Thomas'' has a significant amount of parallel sayings.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=31-32}} Yet, a striking difference is that the canonical sayings center on the coming endtime, while the Thomas-sayings center on a kingdom of heaven that is already here, and not a future event.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=32}} According to Koester, this is because the Thomas-sayings are older, implying that in the earliest forms of Christianity Jesus was regarded as a wisdom-teacher.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=32}} An alternative hypothesis states that the Thomas authors wrote in the second century, changing existing sayings and eliminating the apocalyptic concerns.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=32}} According to April DeConinck, such a change occurred when the endtime did not come, and the Thomasine tradition turned toward a \"new theology of mysticism\" and a \"theological commitment to a fully-present kingdom of heaven here and now, where their church had attained Adam and Eve's divine status before the Fall.\"{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=32}}\n\n===Johannine literature===\nThe prologue of the [[Gospel of John]] describes the incarnated Logos, the light that came to earth, in the person of Jesus.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=33}} The ''Apocryphon of John'' contains a scheme of three descendants from the heavenly realm, the third one being Jesus, just as in the Gospel of John. The similarities probably point to a relationship between gnostic ideas and the Johannine community.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=33}} According to Raymond Brown, the Gospel of John shows \"the development of certain gnostic ideas, especially Christ as heavenly revealer, the emphasis on light versus darkness, and anti-Jewish animus.\"{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=33}} The Johannine material reveals debates about the redeemer myth.{{sfn|Perkins|1987|p=3530}} The Johannine letters show that there were different interpretations of the gospel story, and the Johannine images may have contributed to second-century Gnostic ideas about Jesus as a redeemer who descended from heaven.{{sfn|Perkins|1987|p=3530}} According to DeConinck, the Gospel of John shows a \"transitional system from early Christianity to gnostic beliefs in a God who transcends our world.\"{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=33}} According to DeConinck, the ''John'' shows a beginning bifurcation between Jesus' \"Father in Heaven\", and the Jews' \"Father of the Devil\", which may have developed into the gnostic idea of the Monad and the Demiurge.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=33}}\n\n===Paul and Gnosticism===\n[[Tertullian]] calls [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] \"the apostle of the heretics\",{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=107}} because Paul's writings were attractive to gnostics, and interpreted in a gnostic way, while Jewish Christians found him to stray from the Jewish roots of Christianity.{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=107-108}} Paul wrote to the Corinthian church members as \"having knowledge\" ({{lang-gr|\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd}}, ''ton echonta gnosin'').<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|8:10|NKJV}}</ref> [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] claims that in some cases, Paul affirmed views that were closer to gnosticism than to proto-orthodox Christianity.{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=108}}\n\nAccording to [[Clement of Alexandria]], the disciples of Valentinus said that Valentinus was a student of a certain [[Theudas (teacher of Valentinius)|Theudas]], who was a student of Paul,{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=108}} and Elaine Pagels notes that Paul's epistles were interpreted by Valentinus in a gnostic way, and Paul could be considered a proto-[[gnostic]] as well as a proto-[[Catholic]].{{sfn|Pagels|1975}} Many Nag Hammadi texts, including, for example, the ''Prayer of Paul'' and the Coptic ''Apocalypse of Paul'', consider Paul to be \"the great apostle\".{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=108}} The fact that he claimed to have received his gospel directly by revelation from God appealed to the gnostics, who claimed ''gnosis'' from the risen Christ.{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=109}} The Naasenes, Cainites, and Valentinians referred to Paul's epistles.{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=109-110}} [[The Jesus Mysteries|Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy]] have expanded upon this idea of Paul as a gnostic teacher;<ref>Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy, ''[[The Jesus Mysteries]],'' 1999</ref> although their premise that Jesus was invented by early Christians based on an alleged Greco-Roman mystery cult has been dismissed by scholars.<ref>[[Bart D.

It depicts creation in a series of [[Emanationism|emanations]] from a primal monadic source, finally resulting in the creation of the material universe. These schools tend to view evil in terms of matter that is markedly inferior to goodness and lacking spiritual insight and goodness rather than as an equal force.\n\nMany of these movements used texts related to Christianity, with some identifying themselves as specifically Christian, though quite different from the [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] or [[Roman Catholic]] forms. [[Jesus]] and several of his apostles, such as [[Thomas the Apostle]], claimed as the founder of the [[Saint Thomas Christians|Thomasine form of Gnosticism]], figure in many Gnostic texts. [[Mary Magdalene]] is respected as a Gnostic leader, and is considered superior to the [[twelve apostles]] by some gnostic texts, such as the [[Gospel of Mary]]. [[John the Evangelist]] is claimed as a Gnostic by some Gnostic interpreters,<ref>[[Elaine Pagels]], ''The Johannine Gospel'' in Gnostic Exegesis. Heracleon's Commentary on John.

In the early- to mid-fourth century, Sethianism fragmented into various sectarian Gnostic groups such as the [[Archontics]], Audians, [[Borborites]], and Phibionites, and perhaps [[Stratiotici]], and Secundians).{{sfn|Turner|2001|p=260}}{{sfn|Turner|1986|p=59}} Some of these groups existed into the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Turner|2001|p=260}}\n\n====Samaritan Baptist sects====\nAccording to Magris, Samaritan Baptist sects were an offshoot of [[John the Baptist]].{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515}} One offshoot was in turn headed by [[Dositheos (Samaritan)|Dositheus]], [[Simon Magus]], and [[Menander (gnostic)|Menander]]. It was in this milieu that the idea emerged that the world was created by ignorant angels. Their baptismal ritual removed the consequences of sin, and led to a regeneration by which natural death, which was caused by these angels, was overcome.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515}} The Samaritan leaders were viewed as \"the embodiment of God's power, spirit, or wisdom, and as the redeemer and revealer of 'true knowledge{{' \"}}.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515}}\n\nThe [[Simonians]] were centered on Simon Magus, the magician baptised by Philip and rebuked by Peter in Acts 8, who became in early Christianity the archetypal false teacher. The ascription by Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and others of a connection between schools in their time and the individual in Acts 8 may be as legendary as the stories attached to him in various apocryphal books. Justin Martyr identifies Menander of Antioch as Simon Magus' pupil.

It was an intellectually vibrant tradition,<ref>Markschies, ''Gnosis: An Introduction'', 94.</ref> with an elaborate and philosophically \"dense\" form of Gnosticism. Valentinus' students elaborated on his teachings and materials, and several varieties of their central myth are known.\n\nValentinian Gnosticism may have been monistic rather than dualistic.{{refn|group=note|Quotes:<br>* Elaine Pagels: \"Valentinian gnosticism [...] differs essentially from dualism\";<ref name=\"pagels\">{{cite book | last=Pagels | first=Elaine | title=''The Gnostic Gospels'' | year=1978 }}</ref><br>* Schoedel: \"a standard element in the interpretation of Valentinianism and similar forms of Gnosticism is the recognition that they are fundamentally monistic\".<ref name=\"schoedel\">{{cite book | last =Schoedel | first=William | title= \"Gnostic Monism and the Gospel of Truth\" in ''The Rediscovery of Gnosticism, Vol.1: The School of Valentinus'', (ed.)

Valentinians understood the conflict between ''Jews'' and ''Gentiles'' in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] to be a coded reference to the differences between ''[[Psychics (gnosticism)|Psychics]]'' (people who are partly spiritual but have not yet achieved separation from carnality) and ''[[Pneumatic (Gnosticism)|Pneumatics]]'' (totally spiritual people). The Valentinians argued that such codes were intrinsic in gnosticism, secrecy being important to ensuring proper progression to true inner understanding.{{refn|group=note|Irenaeus describes how the [[Valentinians]] claim to find evidence in [[Ephesians]] for their characteristic belief in the existence of the [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|\u00c6ons]] as supernatural beings: \"Paul also, they affirm, very clearly and frequently names these \u00c6ons, and even goes so far as to preserve their order, when he says, \"To all the generations of the \u00c6ons of the \u00c6on.\u201d (Ephesians 3:21) Nay, we ourselves, when at the giving of thanks we pronounce the words, 'To \u00c6ons of \u00c6ons' (for ever and ever), do set forth these \u00c6ons.

Unlike the Gnostics, Cerinthus taught Christians to observe the Jewish law; his demiurge was holy, not lowly; and he taught the Second Coming. His gnosis was a secret teaching attributed to an apostle.

There is little evidence concerning the nature of this group. Hippolytus claims that they believed that indulgence in sin was the key to salvation because since the body is evil, one must defile it through immoral activity (see [[libertinism]]).

These movements are considered by most to be religions in their own right, and are not emanations from Christianity or [[Judaism]].\n\n====Manichaeism====\n[[File:Manicheans.jpg|thumb|Manicheanism priests writing at their desks, with panel inscription in [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]]. Manuscript from Khocho, [[Tarim Basin]].]]\n{{Main|Manichaeism}}\nManichaeism was founded by the [[Prophet Mani]] (216\u2013276). Mani's father was a member of the [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish-Christian]] sect of the [[Elcesaites]], a subgroup of the [[Gnostic Ebionites]]. At ages 12 and 24, Mani had visionary experiences of a \"heavenly twin\" of his, calling him to leave his father's sect and preach the true message of Christ. In 240\u201341, Mani travelled to the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] of the [[Sakhas]] in modern-day [[Afghanistan]], where he studied [[Hinduism]] and its various extant philosophies. Returning in 242, he joined the court of [[Shapur I]], to whom he dedicated his only work written in Persian, known as the ''[[Shabuhragan]]''. The original writings were written in [[Syriac Aramaic]], in a unique [[Manichaean script]].\n\nManichaeism conceives of two coexistent realms of light and darkness that become embroiled in conflict. Certain elements of the light became entrapped within darkness, and the purpose of material creation is to engage in the slow process of extraction of these individual elements. In the end the kingdom of light will prevail over darkness. Manicheanism inherits this dualistic mythology from [[Zurvanism|Zurvanist Zoroastrianism]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Zaehner|first=Richard Charles|title=The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism|year=1961|publisher=Putnam|location=New York|isbn=978-1-84212-165-8}}</ref> in which the eternal spirit [[Ahura Mazda]] is opposed by his antithesis, [[Angra Mainyu]]. This dualistic teaching embodied an elaborate cosmological myth that included the defeat of a primal man by the powers of darkness that devoured and imprisoned the particles of light.<ref>[http://www.themystica.org/mystica/articles/d/dualism.html]</ref>\n\nAccording to Kurt Rudolph, the decline of [[Manichaeism]] that occurred in Persia in the 5th century was too late to prevent the spread of the movement into the east and the west.<ref name=\"Kurt\"/> In the west, the teachings of the school moved into Syria, Northern Arabia, Egypt and North Africa.{{refn|group=note|Where Augustine was a member of the school from 373\u2013382.<ref name=\"Oxford:Platonism\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Cross |editor1-first=Frank L. |editor2-last=Livingstone |editor2-first=Elizabeth |chapter=Platonism |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-280290-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Augustine the Theologian |last=TeSelle |first=Eugene |year=1970 |location=London |pages=347\u2013349 |isbn= 978-0-223-97728-0}} March 2002 edition: {{ISBN|1-57910-918-7}}.</ref>}} There is evidence for Manicheans in Rome and [[Dalmatia]] in the 4th century, and also in Gaul and Spain. From Syria it progressed still farther, into Palestine, [[Asia Minor]] and Armenia. The influence of Manicheanism was attacked by imperial elects and polemical writings, but the religion remained prevalent until the 6th century, and still exerted influence in the emergence of the [[Paulicians]], [[Bogomil]]s and Cathari in the Middle Ages, until it was ultimately stamped out by the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"Kurt\">Kurt Rudolph, ''Gnosis: The Nature & Structure of Gnosticism'' (Koehler and Amelang, [[Leipzig]], 1977)</ref>\n\nIn the east, Rudolph relates, Manicheanism was able to bloom, because the religious monopoly position previously held by Christianity and Zoroastrianism had been broken by nascent Islam. In the early years of the Arab conquest, Manicheanism again found followers in Persia (mostly amongst educated circles), but flourished most in Central Asia, to which it had spread through Iran. Here, in 762, Manicheanism became the state religion of the [[Uyghur Empire]].<ref name=\"Kurt\"/>\n\n====Mandaeanism====\n{{Main|Mandaeanism}}\n[[File:Mandaean-Mandi-Nasiriya-Iraq.jpg|thumbnail|right|Mandaean house of worship in [[Nasiriya]], Iraq]]The Mandaeans are [[Semitic people|Semites]] and speak a dialect of Eastern Aramaic known as Mandaic. Their religion has been practised primarily around the lower [[Karun]], [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] and the rivers that surround the [[Shatt-al-Arab]] waterway, part of southern Iraq and [[Khuzestan Province]] in Iran. Mandaeanism is still practiced in small numbers, in parts of southern Iraq and the Iranian province of [[Khuzestan]], and there are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide.<ref name=\"yaledailynews\">[http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/20341 Iraqi minority group needs U.S. attention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025053439/http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/20341 |date=2007-10-25 }}, Kai Thaler, ''Yale Daily News'', March 9, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe name of the group derives from the term ''Mand\u0101 d-Heyyi'', which roughly means \"Knowledge of Life\". Although the exact chronological origins of this movement are not known, John the Baptist eventually came to be a key figure in the religion, as an emphasis on baptism is part of their core beliefs. As with Manichaeism, despite certain ties with Christianity,<ref>King, Karen L. ''What Is Gnosticism?'' <!--publisher, place, & date?-->, p.91.</ref> Mandaeans do not believe in Moses, Jesus, or Mohammed. Their beliefs and practices likewise have little overlap with the religions that manifested from those religious figures and the two should not be confused. Significant amounts of original Mandaean Scripture, written in [[Mandaean Aramaic]], survive in the modern era. The primary source text is known as the [[Ginza Rba|Genz\u0101 Rabb\u0101]] and has portions identified by some scholars as being copied as early as the 3rd century. There is also the [[Qolusta|Qolast\u0101]], or Canonical Book of Prayer and The Book of John the Baptist (sidra \u1e0f-iahia).\n\n===Middle Ages===\nAfter its demise in the Mediterranean world, Gnosticism lived on in the periphery of the Byzantine Empire, and resurfaced in the western world. The [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], an [[Adoptionist]] group which flourished between 650 and 872 in Armenia and the Eastern Themes of the [[Byzantine Empire]], were accused by orthodox medieval sources of being Gnostic and quasi [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] Christian. The [[Bogomils]], emerged in [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] between 927 and 970 and spread throughout Europe. It was as [[Syncretism#Religious syncretism|synthesis]] of Armenian [[Paulicianism]] and the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] reform movement.\n\nThe [[Catharism|Cathar]]s (Cathari, Albigenses or Albigensians) were also accused by their enemies of the traits of Gnosticism; though whether or not the Cathari possessed direct historical influence from ancient Gnosticism is disputed. If their critics are reliable the basic conceptions of Gnostic cosmology are to be found in Cathar beliefs (most distinctly in their notion of a lesser, Satanic, creator god), though they did not apparently place any special relevance upon knowledge (''gnosis'') as an effective salvific force.{{Verify source|date=November 2010}}\n\n====Influence on Islam====\nGnostic thoughts found their way into [[Islam]] during the early medieval age.

Especially in the \"Um-al Kitab\" [[Azazel#Islam|Azazel]] resembles the gnostic demiurge.

These writings had an antagonistic bias towards gnostic teachings, and were incomplete. Several heresiological writers, such as Hippolytus, made little effort to exactly record the nature of the [[sect]]s they reported on, or transcribe their sacred texts. Reconstructions of incomplete Gnostic texts were attempted in modern times, but research on Gnosticism was coloured by the orthodox views of those heresiologists.\n\n[[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100/114 \u2013 c. 162/168) wrote the ''[[First Apology]]'', addressed to [[Roman Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]], which criticising [[Simon Magus]], [[Menander]] and [[Marcion]]. Since this time, both Simon and Menander have been considered as 'proto-Gnostic'.<ref>Markschies, ''Gnosis'', 37</ref> [[Irenaeus]] (died c. 202) wrote ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (c. 180\u2013185), which identifies [[Simon Magus]] from [[Flavia Neapolis]] in [[Samaria]] as the inceptor of Gnosticism. From Samaria he charted an apparent spread of the teachings of Simon through the ancient \"knowers\" into the teachings of Valentinus and other, contemporary Gnostic sects.{{refn|group=note|This understanding of the transmission of Gnostic ideas, despite Irenaeus' certain antagonistic bias, is often utilized today, though it has been criticized.}} [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] (170\u2013235) wrote the ten-volume ''[[Refutatio Omnium Haeresium|Refutation Against all Heresies]]'', of which eight have been unearthed. It also focuses on the connection between pre-Socratic (and therefore Pre-Incantation of Christ) ideas and the false beliefs of early gnostic heretical leaders. Thirty-three of the groups he reported on are considered Gnostic by modern scholars, including 'the foreigners' and 'the [[Seth]] people'. Hippolytus further presents individual teachers such as Simon, [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]], [[Secundus (gnostic)|Secundus]], [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]], [[Heracleon]], [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]] and [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Colorbasus]]. [[Tertullian]] (c. 155\u2013230) from [[Carthage]] wrote ''Adversus Valentinianos'' ('Against the Valentinians'), c.{{nbsp}}206, as well as five books around 207\u2013208 chronicling and refuting the teachings of [[Marcion]].\n\n===Gnostic texts===\n{{See also|Gnostic texts|Nag Hammadi library}}\nPrior to the discovery at Nag Hammadi, a limited number of texts were available to students of Gnosticism. Reconstructions were attempted from the records of the heresiologists, but these were necessarily coloured by the motivation behind the source accounts.\n\nThe Nag Hammadi library {{refn|group=note|Sometimes popularly known as the ''Gnostic Gospels'' after [[Elaine Pagels]]' 1979 book of the same name, but the term has a wider meaning}} is a collection of [[Gnostic texts]] discovered in 1945 near Nag Hammadi, Upper Egypt. Twelve leather-bound [[papyrus]] [[codex|codices]] buried in a sealed jar were found by a local farmer named Muhammed al-Samman.<ref>[[Marvin Meyer]] and [[James M. Robinson]], ''The Nag Hammadi Scriptures: The International Edition''. HarperOne, 2007. pp 2-3. {{ISBN|0-06-052378-6}}</ref> The writings in these codices comprised fifty-two mostly Gnostic [[treatise]]s, but they also include three works belonging to the ''[[Hermetica|Corpus Hermeticum]]'' and a partial translation/alteration of Plato's ''Republic''.  These codices may have belonged to a nearby [[Saint Pachomius|Pachomian]] monastery, and buried after [[Athanasius|Bishop Athanasius]] condemned the use of [[Biblical canon|non-canonical]] books in his [[Easter letter|Festal Letter of 367]].<ref>James Robinson, introduction to ''The Nag Hammadi Library in English''.</ref> Though the original language of composition was probably [[Greek language|Greek]], the various codices contained in the collection were written in [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. A 1st- or 2nd-century date of composition for the lost Greek originals has been proposed, though this is disputed; the manuscripts themselves date from the 3rd and 4th centuries. The Nag Hammadi texts demonstrated the fluidity of early Christian scripture and early Christianity itself.{{refn|group=note|According to Layton, \"the lack of uniformity in ancient Christian scripture in the early period is very striking, and it points to the substantial diversity within the Christian religion.\"<ref>Layton, ''The Gnostic Scriptures'', xviii</ref>}}\n\n==Academic studies==\n\n===Development===\nPrior to the discovery of Nag Hammadi, the Gnostic movements were largely perceived through the lens of the early church heresiologists. [[Johann Lorenz von Mosheim]] (1694\u20131755) proposed that Gnosticism developed on its own in Greece and Mesopotamia, spreading to the west and incorporating Jewish elements. According to Mosheim, Jewish thought took Gnostic elements and used them against Greek philosophy.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3531}} J.{{nbsp}}Horn and Ernest Anton Lewald proposed Persian and Zoroastrian origins, while Jacques Matter described Gnosticism as an intrusion of eastern cosmological and theosophical speculation into Christianity.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3531}}\n\nIn the 1880s Gnosticism was placed within Greek philosophy, especially neo-Platonism.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} [[Adolf von Harnack]] (1851\u20131930), who belonged to the ''School of the History of Dogma'' and proposed a ''Kirchengeschichtliches Ursprungsmodell'', saw gnosticism as an internal development within the church under the influence of Greek philosophy.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}}{{sfn|Lahe|2006|p=221}} According to Harnack, Gnosticism was the \"acute Hellenization of Christianity.\"{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}}\n\nThe ''[[Religionsgeschichtliche Schule]]'' (\"history of religions school\", 19th century) had a profound influence on the study of Gnosticism.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} The ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' saw Gnosticism as a pre-Christian phenomenon, and Christian ''gnosis'' as only one, and even marginal instance of this phenomenon.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} According to [[Wilhelm Bousset]] (1865\u20131920), Gnosticism was a form of Iranian and Mesopotamian syncretism,{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} and [[Eduard Norden]] (1868\u20131941) also proposed pre-Christian origins,{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} while [[Richard August Reitzenstein]] (1861\u20131931), and [[Rudolf Bultmann]] (1884\u20131976) also situated the origins of Gnosticism in Persia.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} [[Hans Heinrich Schaeder]] (1896\u20131957) and Hans Leisegang saw Gnosticism as an amalgam of eastern thought in a Greek form.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}}\n\n[[Hans Jonas]] (1903\u20131993) took an intermediate approach, using both the comparative approach of the ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' and the existentialist hermeneutics of Bultmann. Jonas emphasized the duality between God and the world, and concluded that Gnosticism cannot be derived from Platonism.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3533}}\n\nContemporary scholarship largely agrees that Gnosticism has Jewish or Judeo-Christian origins;{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3533}} this theses is most notably put forward by [[Gershom G. Scholem]] (1897\u20131982) and [[Gilles Quispel]] (1916\u20132006).{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3533-3534}}\n\nThe study of Gnosticism and of early Alexandrian Christianity received a strong impetus from the discovery of the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] [[Nag Hammadi Library]] in 1945.{{sfn|Broek||1996|p=vii}}{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3535}} A great number of translations have been published, and the works of [[Elaine Pagels]], Professor of Religion at [[Princeton University]], especially ''The Gnostic Gospels'', which detailed the suppression of some of the writings found at Nag Hammadi by early bishops of the Christian church, has popularized Gnosticism in mainstream culture,{{r|National_Book_Award|group=web}}{{r|Beliefnet|group=web}} but also incited strong responses and condemnations from clergical writers.{{sfn|Quispel|2004|p=8}}\n\n===Definitions of Gnosticism===\nAccording to Matthew J. Dillon, six trends can be discerned in the definitions of Gnosticism:{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=24}}\n* Typologies, \"a catalogue of shared characteristics that are used to classify a group of objects together.\"{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=24}}\n* Traditional approaches, viewing Gnosticism as a Christian heresy{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=25}}\n* Phenomenological approaches, most notably [[Hans Jonas]]{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=26}}\n* Restricting Gnosticism, \"identifying which groups were explicitly called gnostics\",{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=27}} or which groups were clearly sectarian{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=27}}\n* Deconstructing Gnosticism, abandoning the category of \"Gnosticism\"{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=28}}\n* Psychology and [[cognitive science of religion]], approaching Gnosticism as a psychological phenomena{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=27-28}}\n\n====Typologies====\nThe 1966 [[Messina]] conference on the origins of gnosis and Gnosticism proposed to designate\n{{quote|... a particular group of systems of the second century after Christ\" as ''gnosticism'', and to use ''gnosis'' to define a conception of knowledge that transcends the times, which was described as \"knowledge of divine mysteries for an \u00e9lite.{{sfn|Markschies|2000|p=13}}}}\n\nThis definition has now been abandoned.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=24}} It created a religion, \"Gnosticism\", from the  \"gnosis\" which was a widespread element of ancient religions,{{refn|group=note|Markschies: \"something was being called \"gnosticism\" that the ancient theologians had called 'gnosis'&nbsp;... [A] concept of gnosis had been created by Messina that was almost unusable in a historical sense.\"{{sfn|Markschies|2003|p=14\u201315}}}} suggesting a homogeneous conception of gnosis by these Gnostic religions, which did not exist at the time.{{sfn|Markschies|2003|p=14\u201315}}\n\nAccording to Dillon, the texts from Nag Hammadi made clear that this definition was limited, and that they are \"better classified by movements (such as Valentinian), mythological similarity (Sethian), or similar tropes (presence of a Demiurge).\"{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=24}} Dillon further notes that the Messian-definition \"also excluded pre-Christian Gnosticism and later developments, such as the Mandaeans and the Manichaeans.\"{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=24}}\n\nHans Jonas discerned two main currents of Gnosticism, namely Syrian-Egyptian, and Persian, which includes [[Manichaeism|Manicheanism]] and [[Mandaeism|Mandaeanism]].{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3533}} Among the Syrian-Egyptian schools and the movements they spawned are a typically more Monist view. Persian Gnosticism possesses more dualist tendencies, reflecting a strong influence from the beliefs of the Persian [[Zurvanism|Zurvanist Zoroastrians]]. The medieaval the Cathars, Bogomils, and Carpocratians seem to include elements of both categories.\n\nGilles Quispel divided Syrian-Egyptian Gnosticism further into Jewish Gnosticism (the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]''){{sfn|Quispel|2005|p=3510}} and Christian Gnosis (Marcion, Basilides, Valentinus). This \"Christian Gnosticism\" was Christocentric, and influenced by Christian writings such as the Gospel of John and the Pauline epistles.{{sfn|Quispel|2005|p=3511}} Other authors speak rather of \"Gnostic Christians\", noting that Gnostics were a prominent substream in the early church.{{sfn|Freke|Gandy|2005}}\n\n====Traditional approaches \u2013 Gnosticism as Christian heresy====\nThe best known example of this approach is [[Adolf von Harnack]] (1851\u20131930), who stated that \"Gnosticism is the acute Hellenization of Christianity.\"{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=25}} According to Dillon, \"many scholars today continue in the vein of Harnack in reading gnosticism as a late and contaminated version of Christianity\", notably Darrell Block, who criticises Elaine Pagels for her view that early Christianity was wildly diverse.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=26}}\n\n====Phenomenological approaches====\n[[Hans Jonas]] (1903\u20131993) took an [[Existential phenomenology|existential phenomenological]] approach to Gnosticism. According to Jonas, [[Social alienation|alienation]] is a distinguishing characteristics of Gnosticism, making it different from contemporary religions. Jonas compares this alienation with the existentialist notion of ''[[geworfenheit]]'', being thrown into a hostile world.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=26}}\n\n====Restricting Gnosticism====\nIn the late 1980s scholars voiced concerns about the broadness of \"Gnosticism\" as a meaningful category. Bentley Layton proposed to category Gnosticism by delineating which groups were marked as gnostic in ancient texts. According to Layton, this term was mainly applied by heresiologists to the myth described in the ''Apocryphon of John'', and was used mainly by the Sethians and the Ophites. According to Layton, texts which refer to this myth can be called \"classical Gnostic\".{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=27}}\n\nIn addition, Alastair Logan uses social theory to identify Gnosticism. He uses [[Rodney Stark]] and William Bainbridge's sociological theory on traditional religion, sects and cults. According to Logan, the Gnostics were a cult, at odds with the society at large.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=27}}\n\n====Deconstructing Gnosticism====\nAccording to [[Michael Allen Williams]], the concept of Gnosticism as a distinct religious tradition is questionable, since \"gnosoi\" was a pervasive characteristics of many religious traditions in antiquity, and not restricted to the so-called Gnostic systems.{{sfn|Williams|1999}} According to Williams, the conceptual foundations on which the category of Gnosticism rests are the remains of the agenda of the [[heresiology|heresiologists]].{{sfn|Williams|1999}} The early church heresiologists created an interpretive definition of Gnosticism, and modern scholarship followed this example and created a ''categorical'' definition. According to Williams the term needs replacing to more accurately reflect those movements it comprises,{{sfn|Williams|1999}}and suggests to replace it with the term \"the Biblical demiurgical tradition\".{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=28}}\n\nAccording to Karen King, scholars have \"unwittingly continued the project of ancient heresiologists\", searching for non-Christian influences, thereby continuing to portray a pure, original Christianity.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=28}}\n\n====Psychological approaches====\n[[Carl Jung]] approached Gnosticism from a psychological perspective, which was followed by Gilles Quispel. According to this approach, Gnosticism is a map for the human development, in which an undivided person, centered on the [[Self in Jungian psychology|Self]], develops out of the fragmentary personhood of young age. According to Quispel, gnosis is a third force in western culture, alongside faith and reason, which offers an experiential awareness of this Self.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=28}}\n\nAccording to [[Ioan Petru Culianu|Ioan Culianu]], gnosis is made possible through universal operations of the mind, which can be arrived at \"anytime, anywhere\".{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=28\u201329}} A similar suggestion has been made by Edward Conze, who suggested that the similarities between ''[[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|praj\u00f1\u0101]]'' and ''sophia'' may be due to \"the actual modalities of the human mind\", which in certain conditions result in similar experiences.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=165}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Esoteric Character of the Gospels]]\n* [[Marcellina (gnostic)]]\n* [[Mithras]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|2}}\n\n===Subnotes===\n{{reflist|group=subnote|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Printed sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- A -->\n* {{cite book | last = Aland | first = Barbara | title = Festschrift f\u00fcr Hans Jonas | publisher = Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht | year = 1978 | isbn = 978-3-525-58111-7 | title-link = Festschrift }}\n* {{Citation | last =Albrile | first =Ezio | year =2005 | chapter =Gnosticism: History of Study | editor-last =Jones | editor-first= Lindsay  |title =MacMillan Encyclopdia of Religion | publisher =MacMillan}}\n<!-- B -->\n* {{Citation | last =Bauer | first =Walter | authorlink = Walter Bauer | title =Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity | publisher =Fortress | isbn =978-0-8006-1363-1| date =1979-01-01 }}\n* {{Citation |last=Brakke |first=David |year=2010 |title=The Gnostics: Myth, Ritual, and Diversity in Early Christianity  |publisher= Harvard University Press |asin =B004Z14APQ}}\n* {{Citation |last=Broek |first=Roelof van den |authorlink=Roel van den Broek | year =1996 |title=Studies in Gnosticism and Alexandrian Christianity}}\n* {{Citation |last=Broek |first=Roelof van den |year=2013 |title=Gnostic Religion in Antiquity |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}\n* {{cite book |last=Burstein |first= Dan |title= Secrets of Mary Magdalene |publisher= CDS Books |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-1-59315-205-5 }}\n<!-- C -->\n* {{Citation | last1 =Cohen | first1 =Arthur A. | last2 =Mendes-Flohr | first2 =Paul | year =2010 | title =20th Century Jewish Religious Thought}}\n* {{Citation | last =Conze | first =Edward | year =1967 | chapter =Buddhism and Gnosis | editor-last =Bianchi | editor-first =U.  | title =Origins of Gnosticism: Colloquium of Messina, 13\u201318 April 1966}}\n* {{Citation | last =Conze | first =Edward | year =1967 | title =Buddhist prajna and Greek Sophia | journal =Religion.

The first published account of the Gospel was in 1717, when a brief reference to the Spanish text is found in ''De religione Mohamedica'' by [[Adriaan Reland]];<ref name=\"Fremaux 1999 14\">{{Cite book|last=Fremaux |first=Michel |author2=Cirillo, Luigi |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 2nd Edn revised |year=1999 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=14 | ISBN=9782701013893}}</ref> and then in 1718, a much more detailed description of the Italian text by the Irish [[Deism|deist]] [[John Toland]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=lxv\u2013lxxi |nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref> Both Italian and Spanish texts are referred to in 1734 by [[George Sale]] in ''The Preliminary Discourse to the Koran'':\n\n{{quote|The Muhammadans have also a Gospel in Arabic, attributed to saint Barnabas, wherein the history of Jesus Christ is related in a manner very different from what we find in the true Gospels, and correspondent to those traditions which Muhammad has followed in his [[Quran]]. Of this Gospel the Moriscoes in Africa have a translation in Spanish; and there is in the library of Prince [[Eugene of Savoy]], a manuscript of some antiquity, containing an Italian translation of the same Gospel, made, it is to be supposed, for the use of renegades. This book appears to be no original forgery of the Muhammadans, though they have no doubt interpolated and altered it since, the better to serve their purpose; and in particular, instead of the [[Paraclete]] or Comforter, they have, in this apocryphal gospel, inserted the word Periclyte, that is, the ''famous'' or ''illustrious'', by which they pretend their prophet was foretold by name, that being the signification of Muhammad in Arabic; and this they say to justify that passage in the Quran where Jesus Christ is formally asserted to have foretold his coming under his other name [[Ahmed]], which is derived from the same root as Muhammad and of the same import.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sale |first=George |title=The Koran: Preliminary Discourse|chapter=Of the Doctrines and Positive Precepts of the Quran which relate to Faith and Religious Duties |chapter-url=http://bible.ca/islam/library/Wherry/Commentary1/sect4.htm |year=1882 |publisher=Frederick Warne & [[Tr\u00fcbner & Co]]., Ludgate Hill |pages=123|isbn=0-524-07942-0}}</ref>}}\n\nSale's translation of the Qur'an text became the standard English version at that time; and through its dissemination, and that of the Preliminary Discourse, an awareness of the Gospel of Barnabas spread widely in scholarly circles; prompting many fruitless attempts to find the Arabic original to which Sale referred. However, in his description of the Gospel in the ''Preliminary Discourse'', Sale was relying entirely on second-hand accounts. For example, contrary to Sale's notice, the words ''[[paraclete]]'' or ''periclyte'' are not explicitly found in the text of either the Spanish or Italian versions; although the Greek term ''periclyte'' is transliterated into Arabic in one of the marginal notes to the Italian manuscript at Chapter 44, as a gloss to the Italian 'uno splendore' which is indeed there applied to Muhammad by name. Subsequent to the preparation of the Preliminary Discourse, Sale was able to borrow the Spanish manuscript itself and had a transcript made.\n\n==Earlier occurrences of a Gospel of Barnabas==\nA \"Gospel according to Barnabas\" is mentioned in two early [[Christian]] lists of \"[[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]]\" works: the [[Latin]] text of ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]''<ref name=\"Raggxiv\" /> (6th century), as well as a 7th-century Greek ''[[List of the Sixty Books]]''. These lists are independent witnesses. In 1698 [[John Ernest Grabe]] found an otherwise unreported saying of Jesus,<ref name=\"Cirillo 1977 244\">{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=244}}</ref> attributed to the [[Apostle Barnabas]], amongst the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts in the Baroccian collection in the [[Bodleian Library]]; which he speculated might be a quotation from this \"lost gospel\". [[John Toland]] translates the quotation as, ''The Apostle Barnabas says, he gets the worst of it who overcomes in evil contentions; because he thus comes to have the more sin''; and claimed to have identified a corresponding phrase when he examined the surviving Italian manuscript of the Gospel of Barnabas in [[Amsterdam]] before 1709. Subsequent scholars examining the Italian and Spanish texts have been unable, however, to confirm Toland's observation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xlvi |nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref>\n\nThis work should not be confused also with the surviving ''Epistle of Barnabas'', which may have been written in 2nd century [[Alexandria]]. There is no link between the two books in style, content, or history other than their attribution to Barnabas. On the issue of [[circumcision]], the books clearly hold very different views, that of the epistle's rejection of the [[Jew]]ish practice as opposed to the gospel's promotion of the same. Neither should it be confused with the surviving ''[[Acts of Barnabas]]'', which narrates an account of Barnabas' travels, martyrdom and burial, and which is generally thought to have been written in [[Cyprus]] sometime after 431.\n\nIn A.D. 478, during the reign of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] (later [[Byzantine]]) Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], archbishop Anthemios of [[Cyprus]] announced that the hidden burial place of Barnabas had been revealed to him in a dream. The saint's body was claimed to have been discovered in a cave with a copy of the canonical [[Gospel of Matthew]] on its breast; according to the contemporary account of [[Theodorus Lector]], who reports that both bones and gospel book were presented by Anthemios to the emperor.<ref name=\"Cirillo 1977 244\"/> Some scholars who maintain the antiquity of the Gospel of Barnabas propose that the text purportedly discovered in 478 should be identified with the Gospel of Barnabas instead; but this supposition is at variance with an account of Anthemios's gospel book by [[Severus of Antioch]], who reported having examined the manuscript around the year 500, seeking to find whether it supported the piercing of the crucified Jesus by a spear at Matthew 27:49 (it did not). According to the 11th-century Byzantine historian [[Georgios Kedrenos]], an [[uncial]] manuscript of Matthew's Gospel, believed to be that found by Anthemios, was then still preserved in the Chapel of St Stephen in the imperial palace in [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"Cirillo 1977 244\"/>\n\n==Manuscripts==\n\n=== Italian manuscript ===\n[[File:Balthasar Wigand Josephsplatz 1835.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Austrian Imperial Library, where the Italian manuscript was kept]]\nPrince Eugene's Italian manuscript had been presented to him in 1713 by John Frederick Cramer (1664-1715);<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=x|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref> and was transferred to the [[Austrian National Library]] in [[Vienna]] in 1738 with the rest of his library. In Amsterdam sometime before 1709, Cramer had lent the manuscript to Toland, who writes that; ''(Mr. Cramer) had it out of the library of a person of great name and authority in that said city; who during his life was often heard to put a high value on the piece. Whether as a rarity, or as the model of his religion, I know not.''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=lxvii |nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref> Michel Fremaux reports no success in tracking and identifying this previous owner, or in finding a corresponding manuscript listed in any Amsterdam catalogue or inventory. However, Toland's notice would imply that the unnamed deceased former owner was a prominent [[anti-Trinitarian]] or [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] by religion; and Fremaux conjectures that the manuscript may have been brought to Amsterdam by [[Christopher Sandius]] (1644-1680), either from his own activity as a collector in [[Poland]]; or more likely from his acquisition of the papers of [[Giovanni Michele Bruto]] (1517-1592), who had assembled an extensive collection of manuscript sources in [[Hungary]] and [[Transylvania]].<ref name=\"Fremaux 1999 14\"/>  Cramer had published an edition of Bruto's theological writings in 1698,<ref>{{Cite book|last= Champion |first=J. A. I. |title=The Pillars of Priestcraft Shaken |year=1992 |publisher=CUP |pages=125|isbn=9781107634923}}</ref> and Fremaux speculates that Cramer might have come across the Gospel of Barnabas in the course of his researches within Sandius's library in Amsterdam. Otherwise, Slomp has proposed that [[Gregorio Leti]] (1630\u20131701), whose Amsterdam library had been auctioned-off following his death, could be the unnamed former owner of the Italian manuscript.  Leti however, though hostile to the Papacy (and Sixtus V in particular) was an orthodox Calvinist in religion.\n\nThe Italian manuscript has 506 pages, of which the Gospel of Barnabas fills pages 43 to 500, written within red frames in an Islamic style. The preceding pages five to forty-two are also red framed; but remain blank (other than for Cramer's presentation to Prince Eugene), and it may be inferred that some sort of preface or preliminary text was intended, although the space is much greater than would have been needed for the text of the corresponding Spanish Preface.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fremaux |first=Michel |author2=Cirillo, Luigi |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 2nd Edn revised |year=1999 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=4 |isbn=9782701013893}}</ref> There are chapter rubrics and margin notes in ungrammatical Arabic;<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xlix |nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref> with an occasional [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]] word, and many Turkish syntactical features.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fremaux |first=Michel |author2=Cirillo, Luigi |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 2nd Edn revised |year=1999 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=12 |isbn=9782701013893}}</ref> Its binding is Turkish, and appears to be original;<ref name=\"Ragg 1907 xiii\">{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xiii |nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref> but the paper has an Italian watermark,<ref name=\"Raggxiv\" /> which has been dated between 1563 and 1620.<ref name=\"Raggxiv\"/> The same scribe wrote both the Italian text and the Arabic notes, and was clearly \"occidental\" in being accustomed to write from left to right.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fremaux |first=Michel |author2=Cirillo, Luigi |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 2nd Edn revised |year=1999 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=8 |isbn=9782701013893}}</ref> There are [[catchwords]] at the bottom of each page, a practice common in manuscripts intended to be set up for [[printing]]. The manuscript appears to be unfinished, in that the Prologue and 222 chapters are provided throughout with framed blank spaces for titular headings, but only 28 of these spaces have been filled. This Italian manuscript formed the basis for the most commonly circulated English version, a translation undertaken by [[Lonsdale Ragg|Lonsdale]] and Laura Ragg and published in 1907. The Raggs' English version was quickly re-translated into Arabic by [[Rashid Rida]], in an edition published in Egypt in 1908.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fremaux |first=Michel |author2=Cirillo, Luigi |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 2nd Edn revised |year=1999 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=v |isbn=9782701013893}}</ref>\n\nThe Italian spelling is idiosyncratic in frequently doubling consonants and adding an intrusive initial \"h\" where a word starts with a vowel (e.g. \"hanno\" for \"anno\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=77}}</ref> The writer is not a professional scribe. Otherwise, however, the orthography and punctuation indicates a hand formed in the first half of the 16th century, and in certain key respects is characteristically Venetian. The underlying dialect however, is Tuscan; and shows a number of characteristic late medieval (14th\u201315th-century) forms. The linguistic experts consulted by the Raggs concluded that the Vienna manuscript was most likely the work of an older Venetian scribe, copying a Tuscan original, and writing in the second half of the 16th century.\n\nThe italian manuscript influenced - through John Toland's \"Nazarenus\" (1718) - the early masterminds of biblical criticism as Reimarus, Lessing or Eichhorn. Lessing\u00b4s \"Urevangeliumshypothese\" (proto-gospel-theory) has been clearly affected by Toland, who thought of the Gospel of Barnabas as a recension of the hebrew gospel used by the ebionites and nazarenes. Thus, Toland identified the italian manuscript as a late descendant of an early jewish-christian gospel that has been received and transmitted by the muslim tradition. Tolands thesis has more recently been resumed by the Orientalists Shlomo Pines (1966), Marc Philonenko (1974) and Luigi Cirillo (1975).<ref>cf.

No trace is known of the original Spanish manuscript after Dr. Monkhouse's death in 1792. \n\nHowever, an 18th-century copy, derived from the manuscript, was mentioned in a 1760 catalogue of the collection of manuscripts of the deceased author [[Joseph Ames (author)|Joseph Ames]], where it was described as ''El Evangelio de Barnabas Apostol, transcribed from one in the Possession of  Mr. [[Edmund Calamy IV|Edm.

From another MS. belonging to Dr. Monkhouse, the Rev. Joseph White, in the notes to his [[Bampton Lectures]], produces a long extract. Sale, who in his translation of the Koran, notices this Gospel, likewise had a MS. of it, which after his death was purchased by the Rev. Edm.

Comparing the Sydney transcript with the counterpart passages quoted in Spanish by Sale, there are no substantial differences, but it would appear that sometime between Sale's death in 1736 and 1745 some 80 chapters of his transcript had been lost; and are consequently also missing from the Sydney copy.\n[[Image:Fisher Library, University of Sydney.JPG|thumb|Fisher Library, University of Sydney. To the left of the image is Fisher North, and to the right is Fisher South.]]\n\nThe Spanish text is preceded by a note claiming that it was translated from Italian by Mustafa de Aranda, an Aragonese Muslim resident in [[Istanbul]]. A Morisco letter of around 1630, now in Madrid, confirms de Aranda as an associate of Ibrahim al-Taybili, in whose works is found the earliest reference to the Spanish Gospel. In the Spanish text, the translator's note is itself preceded by a Preface by one assuming the pseudonym 'Fra Marino', claiming to have stolen a copy of the Italian version from the library of [[Pope]] [[Sixtus V]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sox |first=David |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1984 |publisher=Allen & Unwin |pages=65|isbn=0-04-200044-0}}</ref> Fra Marino, clearly a high ranking Italian ecclesiastic, reports that having a post in the [[Inquisition]] Court, he had come into possession of several works which led him to believe that the Biblical text had been corrupted and that genuine apostolic texts had been improperly excluded. Fra Marino also claims to have been alerted to the existence of the Gospel of Barnabas, from an allusion in a work by [[Irenaeus]] against Paul; in a book which had been presented to him by a lady of the [[Colonna]] family. [[Marino, Italy|Marino]] outside Rome was a Colonna estate, and during the later 16th century Cardinal [[Ascanio Colonna]], a close associate of both Sixtus V and [[Philip II of Spain]], was building a palazzo there.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Montagnani |first=Mara|title=Il Palazzo Colonna di Marino|journal=Castelli Romani |volume=XL n\u00b0 2|pages=46 }}</ref> <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wiegers |first=G.A. |date=April\u2013June 1995 |title=Muhammad as the Messiah: A comparison of the polemical works of Juan Alonso with the Gospel of Barnabas |journal=Biblitheca Orientalis |volume=LII |issue=3/4 |pages=278}}</ref>\n\nThe linguistic forms, spelling and punctuation of the Spanish text (as recorded in the Sydney transcript) are generally close to standard Castilian of the late 16th century; and lack the idiosyncrasies of the Italian manuscript. Hence, linguistically, the surviving Spanish text appears later than the surviving Italian text; but this does not necessarily confirm that the underlying Spanish text is secondary.\n\n=== Comparison ===\nAside from the missing 80 chapters, there are differences in the chapter divisions between the Italian and Spanish texts; and also between the Sydney transcript and the Spanish passages quoted by Dr. White in English. The Italian and Spanish chapters agree for the prologue and up to chapter 116. Chapter 117 in the Italian version is split into Chapters 117 and 118 in the Spanish; and then Chapters 118 and 119 in the Italian correspond with 119 in the Spanish. Chapter 120, before the lacuna, is common to both; but when the Spanish manuscript resumes, its numbered Chapter 200 corresponds to the numbered Italian Chapter 199. The two versions continue one chapter out of phase for the rest of the book so that the final Chapter 222 in the Sydney transcript corresponds to Chapter 221 in the Italian. The final Chapter 222 in the Italian is missing from the Spanish text. In the quotations of Joseph White, there is a further difference in that the long Chapter 218 (217 in the Italian text) is split, so that Chapter 220 in Dr. White's text corresponds to Chapter 219 in the Sydney transcript and Chapter 218 in the Italian manuscript. Dr. White's Chapter 221 corresponds with both Chapters 220 and 221 in the Sydney transcript, and Chapters 219 and 220 in the Italian. In this context it may be noted that Chapter 218 in the Italian manuscript contains a corrected chapter division, in that the scribe originally split off the final paragraph into the start of Chapter 219, and then erased and overwrote the division. This suggests that whatever text the scribe of the Italian manuscript was using as his copy, was unclear as to chapter divisions at this point.\n\nBesides the absent final chapter, and the large lacuna already noted; the Spanish text also misses a section of around 100 words from its Chapter 222 (Chapter 221 in the Italian) and another substantial but shorter section from Chapter 211 (Chapter 210 in the Italian). These may be related to Sale's note that the manuscript was damaged towards the end. Otherwise there are numerous points where words present in the Italian text (and necessary for the sense) are not represented in the Spanish translation. Conversely there are also around a dozen places where the Raggs had speculated that a word or phrase might have been accidentally omitted in their Italian text, and in all these instances, the Spanish text supplies the missing words.\n\nUnlike the Italian text, the Spanish text has no Arabic marginal notes or chapter summaries, nor are the Italian titles for the first twenty-seven chapters represented in the Spanish. There is a title provided in the Spanish text above the Prologue but this differs from that provided above the Prologue in the Italian text. Contrariwise, there is a title provided above Chapter 218 in the Sydney transcript, which is not found either above the corresponding Chapter 217 in the Italian text, nor is quoted at this point by Dr. White.\n\nOther than in their respective copyist errors, there appear to be few substantial differences of meaning between the Spanish and Italian text; but one notable variant is found in the description of the crucifixion of Judas Iscariot in Chapter 218 in the Spanish text (217 in the Italian text). Jesus Christ has been miraculously abstracted from the action; and Judas, transformed into the likeness of Jesus, is crucified in his place. In the Spanish manuscript, and Dr. White's translation, it is said that all Jesus's disciples remained fooled by the transformation throughout the crucifixion \"excepting Peter\"; but this specific qualification is not present in the Italian text, nor is Peter stated as an exception in the earlier account of the transformation itself in Chapter 217 of the Spanish text.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Dante Luca.jpg|thumb|left|Some researchers argue that phrases in Barnabas are very similar to phrases used by [[Dante]]]]\nSome researchers of the work argue for an Italian origin,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=88}}</ref> noting phrases in Barnabas which are very similar to phrases used by [[Dante]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xi|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref> and suggesting that the author of Barnabas borrowed from Dante's works; they take the Spanish version's preface and translators's note as supporting this conclusion.<ref name=\"Ragg 1907 xii\">{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xii |nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref> Other researchers have noted a range of textual similarities between passages in the Gospel of Barnabas, and variously the texts of a series of late medieval [[vernacular]] harmonies of the four canonical gospels (in [[Middle English]] and [[Middle Dutch]], but especially in Middle Italian); which are all speculated as deriving from a lost [[Vetus Latina]] version of the [[Diatessaron]] of [[Tatian]].<ref name=\"Joosten 2002 73\u201396\"/> If true, this would also support an Italian origin.\n\nOther researchers argue that the Spanish version came first; regarding both the translator's note, and the Spanish preface's claims of an Italian source, as fabrications intended to boost the work's credibility by linking it to the Papal libraries. These scholars note parallels with a series of [[Morisco]] forgeries, the [[Lead Books of Sacromonte]], dating from the 1590s; or otherwise with Morisco reworkings of Christian and Islamic traditions, produced following the [[expulsion of the Moriscos]] from Spain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wiegers |first=G.A. |date=April\u2013June 1995 |title=Muhammad as the Messiah: A comparison of the polemical works of Juan Alonso with the Gospel of Barnabas |journal=Biblitheca Orientalis |volume=LII |issue=3/4 |pages=245\u2013292}}</ref>\n\nA detailed comparison between the surviving Italian and Spanish texts shows numerous places where the Spanish reading appears to be secondary, as for example, where a word or phrase necessary for the meaning is missing in the Spanish text but present in the Italian. Bernab\u00e9 Pons, arguing for the priority of the Spanish version, maintains that these are due to transcription errors accumulating through the stages of creating the Sydney manuscript, which is a copy of a copy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bernab\u00e9 Pons |first=Luis F |title=, El texto morisco del Evangelio de San Bernab\u00e9 |year=1998 |publisher=Universidad de Granada |pages=155}}</ref> Joosten, however, while accepting that the carelessness of the two successive English copyists is the most likely explanation for most such instances, nevertheless argues that a minority of such readings are inherently more likely to be due to translation errors in the Spanish text. In particular, he sees the Spanish text as containing numerous 'Italicisms' as, for example, where the Italian text employs the conjunction ''pero'', with an Italian meaning 'therefore'; while the Spanish text also reads ''pero'', with a Spanish meaning 'however'; the Italian sense being the one demanded by the context.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1093/jts/flq010|last=Joosten |first=Jan |date=April 2010 |title=The date and provenance of the Gospel of Barnabas |journal=Journal of Theological Studies |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=200\u2013215}}</ref> He finds no counterpart 'Castilianisms' in the Italian text. There are, however, other passages where the Spanish reading makes sense, while the Italian does not, and many features of the Italian text that are not found in the Spanish; such as the titles for chapters 1\u201327. Joosten argues that this indicates that both the 16th-century Italian and Spanish texts must depend on a lost Italian original, which he, in common with the Raggs, dates substantially to the mid-14th century. Joosten states:\n\n{{quote|A systematic comparison of the Italian and Spanish texts of the Gospel of Barnabas leads to the conclusion that the Spanish was translated from the Italian at a date somewhat removed from the original.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Joosten |first=Jan |date=April 2010 |title=The date and provenance of the Gospel of Barnabas |journal=Journal of Theological Studies |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=214}}</ref>}}\n\nIf the Italian version is the original, then a plausible context for the text in its final form may be within [[History of Unitarianism|anti-Trinitarian]] circles in [[History of Transylvania|Transylvania]].

Although some found initial refuge in Italy (especially [[Venice]]), most resettled in the [[Ottoman Empire]], where Spanish speaking Jews established in Istanbul a rich sub-culture with a flourishing [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] printing industry. Numbers were further augmented after 1550, following campaigns of persecution by the Venetian [[Inquisition]] against Italian [[nontrinitarianism|anti-Trinitarians]] and Jews.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=50}}</ref> Although Muslim teaching at this time strongly opposed the printing of [[Islamic]] or Arabic texts, non-Muslim printing was not, in principle, forbidden.  In the Spanish preface, Fra Marino records his wish that the Gospel of Barnabas should be printed, and the only place in Europe where that would have been possible in the late 16th century would have been Istanbul.\n\nThe lost Spanish manuscript claimed to have been written in Istanbul, and the surviving Italian manuscript has several [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] features;<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=533}}</ref> so, whether the language of origin was Spanish or Italian, Istanbul is regarded by most researchers as the place of origin of the two known texts. A minority of researchers \u2013 such as David Sox<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sox |first=David |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1984 |publisher=Allen & Unwin |pages=73|isbn=0-04-200044-0}}</ref> \u2013 are, however, suspicious of the apparent 'Turkish' features of the Italian manuscript;<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xv|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref> especially the Arabic annotations, which they adjudge to be so riddled with elementary errors as to be most unlikely to have been written in Istanbul (even by an Italian scribe). In particular, they note that the glossing of the Italian version of the ''[[shahada]]'' into Arabic, does not correspond exactly with the standard ritual formula recited daily by every Muslim. These researchers are inclined to infer from these inconsistencies that both manuscripts may represent an exercise in forensic falsification, and they tend to locate their place of origin as Rome.\n\nFew academics argue that the text, in its present form, dates back any earlier than the 14th\u201316th centuries; although a minority see it as containing portions of an earlier work, and almost all would detect the influence of earlier sources\u2014over and above the [[Vulgate]] text of the Latin Bible. Consequently, most researchers would concur with a stratification of the surviving text into at least three distinct layers of composition:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=176}}</ref>\n* An editorial layer dating from the late 16th century; and comprising, at the least, the Spanish preface and the Arabic annotations,\n* A layer of vernacular narrative composition, either in Spanish or Italian, and dating from no earlier than the mid-14th century,\n* A layer derived from earlier source materials, almost certainly transmitted to the vernacular author/translator in Latin; and comprising, at the least, those extensive passages in the Gospel of Barnabas that closely parallel [[pericope]]s in the canonical gospels; but whose underlying text appears markedly distinct from that of the late medieval Latin [[Vulgate]]<ref name=\"Ragg 1907 xxxiii\">{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xxxiii |nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref> (as for instance in the alternative version of the [[Lord's Prayer]] in chapter 37, which includes a concluding [[doxology]], contrary to the Vulgate text, but in accordance with the Diatessaron and many other early variant traditions);\n\nMuch of the controversy and dispute concerning the authenticity of the Gospel of Barnabas can be re-expressed as debating whether specific highly transgressive themes (from an orthodox Christian perspective) might already have been present in the source materials utilised by a 14th\u201316th-century vernacular author, whether they might be due to that author himself, or whether they might even have been interpolated by the subsequent editor. Those researchers who regard these particular themes as primitive, nevertheless do not generally dispute that other parts of the Gospel may be late and anachronistic; while those researchers who reject the authenticity of these particular themes do not generally dispute that other parts of the Gospel could be transmitting variant readings from antiquity.\n\n==Analysis==\nThis work clearly contradicts the New Testament biblical accounts of Jesus and his ministry but has strong parallels with the [[Islam]]ic faith, not only mentioning [[Muhammad]] by name, but including the ''[[shahadah]]'' (chapter 39). It is strongly anti-[[Paul of Tarsus|Pauline]] and anti-[[Trinity|Trinitarian]] in tone. In this work, Jesus is described as a [[prophet]] and not the [[son of God]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wiegers |first=G.A. |date=April\u2013June 1995 |title=Muhammad as the Messiah: A comparison of the polemical works of Juan Alonso with the Gospel of Barnabas |journal=Biblitheca Orientalis |volume=LII |issue=3/4 |pages=285}}</ref> while Paul is called \"the deceived.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/gbar/gbar000.htm|title=The Gospel of Barnabas - Prologue|publisher=}}</ref> Furthermore, the Gospel of Barnabas states that Jesus escaped crucifixion by being raised alive to heaven, while [[Judas Iscariot]] the traitor was crucified in his place. These beliefs\u2014in particular, that Jesus is a prophet of God and raised alive without being crucified\u2014conform to or resemble [[Muslim|Islamic]] teachings which say that Jesus is a major prophet who did not die on the cross but was taken alive by angels to God.\n\nOther passages, however, conflict with the teachings of the [[Qur'an]]\u2014as, for instance, in the account of the [[Virgin Mary in Islam|Nativity]], where [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] is said to have given birth to Jesus without pain<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xxix |nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref> or as in Jesus's ministry, where he permits the drinking of [[wine]] and enjoins [[marriage|monogamy]]<ref name=\"Ragg 1907 xxxv\">{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xxxv |nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref>\u2014though the Qur'an allegedly acknowledges each prophet had a set of their own laws that might differ in some aspects from each other. Other examples include that hell will only be for the committers of the seven deadly sins (Barnabas: 4\u201344/135), anyone who refuses to be circumcised will not enter paradise (Barnabas 17/23), that there are 9 heavens (Barnabas 3/105).\n\nIf the ''Gospel of Barnabas'' is seen as an attempted synthesis of elements from both Christianity and Islam, then 16th- and 17th-century parallels can be suggested in [[Morisco]] and [[nontrinitarianism|anti-Trinitarian]] writings.\n\n==Islamic and anti-Trinitarian views==\nThe Gospel of Barnabas was little known outside academic circles until recent times, when a number of Muslims have taken to publishing it to argue against the orthodox Christian conception of Jesus. It generally resonates better with existing Muslim views than with [[Christianity]]:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=216}}</ref>\n\nQur'an [[Sura]] [[An-Nisa|4]] Verse 157-158:\n<blockquote>'' And because of their saying: We slew the Messiah Jesus son of Mary, Allah's messenger They slew him not nor crucified, but it appeared so unto them; and lo! those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof; they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture ; they slew him not for certain, but Allah took him up unto Himself. Allah is ever Mighty, wise.''<ref>{{harvnb|Pickthall|2001|p=86}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nRather than describing the crucifixion of Jesus, Gospel of Barnabas describes him being raised up into heaven<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xxvii |nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref> It can be likened to the description of [[Elijah]] in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]], Chapter 2. It also foretells the coming of Muhammad by name and it calls Jesus a \"prophet\" whose mission was restricted to the \"house of [[Israel]]\".\n\nIt contains an extended polemic against the doctrine of [[predestination]] (Chapter 164), and in favour of [[justification by faith]]; arguing that the eternal destination of the soul to [[Heaven]] or [[Hell]] is neither pre-determined by God's [[divine grace|grace]] (as in [[Calvinism]]), nor the judgement of God, in his mercy, on the faith of believers on Earth (as in Islam). Instead it states that all those condemned at the [[last judgement]], but who subsequently respond in faith, who demonstrate unfeigned penitence, and who make a free choice of blessedness, will eventually be offered salvation (Chapter 137).<ref name=\"Ragg 1907 xxxv\"/> Only those whose persistent pride prevents them from sincere repentance will remain forever in Hell. Such radically [[Pelagianism|Pelagian]] beliefs in the 16th century were found amongst the anti-Trinitarian Protestant traditions later denoted as [[Unitarianism]]. Some 16th-century anti-Trinitarian divines sought to reconcile Christianity, Islam and Judaism; on the basis of very similar arguments to those presented in the Gospel of Barnabas, arguing that if salvation remains unresolved until the end times, then any one of the three religions could be a valid path to heaven for their own believers. The Spaniard, [[Michael Servetus]] denounced the orthodox Christian formulation of the [[Trinity]] (alleging the only explicit reference to the Trinity in the New Testament to be a later interpolation); and hoped thereby to bridge the doctrinal divide between Christianity and Islam. In 1553 he was executed in [[Geneva]] under the authority of [[John Calvin]], but his teachings remained very influential amongst Italian Protestant exiles.\n\nIncluded in chapter 145 is \"The little book of [[Elijah]]\";<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=230}}</ref> which sets out instructions for a righteous life of [[asceticism]] and [[hermit|hermetic]] spirituality. Over the succeeding 47 chapters, Jesus is recorded as developing the theme that the ancient [[prophet]]s, specifically [[Obadiah]], [[Haggai]] and [[Hosea]], were holy hermits following this religious rule;<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xxxvi |nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref> and contrasting their followers \u2013 termed \"true Pharisees\" \u2013 with the \"false [[Pharisees]]\" who lived in the world, and who constituted his chief opponents. The \"true Pharisees\" are said to congregate on [[Mount Carmel]]. This accords with the teaching of the medieval [[Carmelites]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne |pages=233}}</ref> who lived as an eremetic congregation on Carmel in the 13th century; but who claimed (without any evidence) to be direct successors of Elijah and the [[Old Testament]] prophets. In 1291 the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] advance into [[Syria]] compelled the friars on Carmel to abandon their monastery; but on dispersing through Western Europe they found that Western Carmelite congregations \u2013 especially in Italy \u2013 had largely abandoned the eremetic and ascetic ideal, adopting instead the conventual life and mission of the other [[Mendicant orders]]. Some researchers consider that the ensuing 14th\u201316th-century controversies can be found reflected in the text of the Gospel of Barnabas.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/09596410120051773 |last=Pulcini |first=Theodore |year=2001 |title=In the Shadow of Mount Carmel: the Collapse of the 'Latin East' and the origines of the Gospel of Barnabas |journal=Islam and Christianity |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=191\u2013200}}</ref>\n\nThe Gospel also takes a strongly anti-Pauline tone at times, saying in the Italian version's beginning: \"many, being deceived of Satan, under pretence of piety, are preaching most impious doctrine, calling Jesus son of God, repudiating the circumcision ordained of God for ever, and permitting every unclean meat: among whom also Paul has been deceived.\"\n\n===Prediction of Muhammad===\n\nThe Gospel of Barnabas claims that Jesus predicted the advent of Muhammad, thus conforming with the Qur'an which mentions:\n\n{{quote|And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: O Children of Israel! I am the apostle of God (sent) to you, confirming the Law (which came) before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad. But when he came to them with Clear Signs, they said, this is evident sorcery!|[[Sura 61]]:6 [http://www.islamicity.com/mosque/QURAN/61.htm]}}\n\n([[Ahmad]] is an Arabic name from the same [[triconsonantal]] root as Muhammad: [[\u1e24-M-D]] = [\u062d - \u0645 - \u062f].)\n\nA Muslim scholarly tradition links this Qur'anic passage to the New Testament references to the Paraclete in the canonical Gospel of John (14:16, 14:26, 15:26, 16:7). The Greek word \"[[paraclete]]\" can be translated as \"Counsellor\", and refers according to Christians to the [[Holy Spirit]]. Some Muslim scholars, have noted the similarity to the Greek \"peryklytos\" which can be translated as \"admirable one\"; or in Arabic, \"Ahmad\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xxxi |nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref>\n\nThe name of \"Muhammad\" is frequently mentioned verbatim in the Gospel of Barnabas, as in the following quote:\n{{quote|Jesus answered: \"The name of the Messiah is admirable, for God himself gave him the name when he had created his soul, and placed it in a celestial splendour. God said: 'Wait Mohammed; for thy sake I will to create paradise, the world, and a great multitude of creatures, whereof I make thee a present, insomuch that whoso bless thee shall be blessed, and whoso shall curse thee shall be accursed. When I shall send thee into the world I shall send thee as my messenger of salvation, and thy word shall be true, insomuch that heaven and earth shall fail, but thy faith shall never fail.' Mohammed is his blessed name.\" Then the crowd lifted up their voices, saying: \"O God, send us thy messenger: O Admirable One, come quickly for the salvation of the world!\"|[http://www.barnabas.net/index.php/chapters/495-97-muhammad-is-his-blessed-name Barnabas 97:9\u201310]}}\n\nHowever, while there are many passages where the Gospel of Barnabas sets out alternative readings to parallel [[pericope]]s found in the canonical gospels, none of the references to Muhammad by name occurs in such a [[Synoptic Gospels|synoptic]] passage; and in particular, none of the \"Muhammad\" references in Barnabas corresponds to a \"Paraclete\" reference in canonical John. There is only one instance where the Gospel of Barnabas might be understood as \"correcting\" a known canonical pericope, so as to record a prophecy by Jesus of the (unnamed) Messenger of God:\n\n{{quote|Then Jesus said: \"I am a voice that cries through all Judea, and cries: 'Prepare you the way for the messenger of the Lord', even as it is written in Esaias.\" They said: \"If you be not the Messiah nor Elijah, or any prophet, wherefore do you preach new doctrine, and make yourself of more account than the Messiah?\" Jesus answered: \"The miracles which God works by my hands show that I speak that which God wills; nor indeed do I make myself to be accounted as him of whom you speak. For I am not worthy to unloose the ties of the hosen or the ratchets of the shoes of the Messenger of God whom you call 'Messiah', who was made before me, and shall come after me, and shall bring the words of truth, so that his faith shall have no end.\"|Chapter 43}}\n\nThis passage corresponds closely with the canonical John 1:19\u201330, except that in that passage, the words are spoken by John the Baptist and refer to Jesus. John the Baptist does not feature at all in the Gospel of Barnabas - although in the Qur'an he is identified as the revered prophet Yahya ibn Zakariya, foretelling Jesus.  Nor does the Gospel of Barnabas have any reference to the baptism of Jesus or baptism in general.\n\n====Muhammad as the Messiah====\nAccording to one version{{Specify|date=September 2010}} of the Gospel of Barnabas:\n\n{{quote|Then said the priest: \"How shall the Messiah be called?\" [Jesus answered] \"Muhammed is his blessed name\".|Chapter 97<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wiegers |first=G.A. |date=April\u2013June 1995 |title=Muhammad as the Messiah: A comparison of the polemical works of Juan Alonso with the Gospel of Barnabas |journal=Biblitheca Orientalis |volume=LII |issue=3/4 |pages=246}}</ref>}}\n\nand\n\n{{quote|Jesus confessed, and said the truth: \"I am not the Messiah.\"|42:2<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wiegers |first=G.A. |date=April\u2013June 1995 |title=Muhammad as the Messiah: A comparison of the polemical works of Juan Alonso with the Gospel of Barnabas |journal=Biblitheca Orientalis |volume=LII |issue=3/4 |pages=279}}</ref>}}\n\nAs mentioned above, these pronouncements contradict Islamic belief as Jesus is not only mentioned as a prophet in the Qur'an but also referred to by the title \"al-Masih\" which is the Arabic translation of the term \"Messiah.\" It is also important to note that the Qur'an never makes use of this term to refer to Muhammad and that the only Qur'anic figure to bear this title is Jesus or Isa. Some Muslim scholars{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} argue that the Gospel of Barnabas has been modified, thus inconsistency is observed. Also, some may argue that the word \"Messiah\" can be a formal title for Jesus Christ, but the meaning \"anointed\" can be attributed to others, such as [[King David]], anointed to kingship, and his son [[Solomon]]. Some Muslim scholars{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} state that this references the [[Mahdi]], an eschatological figure in Islam, who will help defeat al-[[Masih ad-Dajjal]] (lit \"the false messiah\", cf. [[antichrist]]), according to Islamic tradition contained within the ''[[sahih]]'' (correct) ''[[hadith]]'' (records of traditions), which Muslims believe to be authentic and reliable narratives of the sayings and [[sunnah|practices]] of Muhammad.\n\nIn the Qur'an, however, it is clearly stated that the messiah will be named ''\"[[Jesus in Islam|Isa]]\"'' (note that [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking [[Christians]] use the name ''[[Jesus|Yasoo`a = \u064a\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0639\u064e]]'', cognate to the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]] ''[[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]]'', to refer to [[Jesus Christ]]: the name ''\"Isa\"'' is present solely in classical Arabic):\n\n(Remember) when the angels said: \"O [[Maryam (sura)|Maryam]] ([[Islamic views of Mary|Mary]])! Verily, [[Allah]] gives you the glad tidings of a [[Revelation|Word]] [\"Be!\" \u2013 and he was! i.e. '\u00cesa the son of Maryam, daughter of [[Imran (father of Maryam)|Imran]] (Eng. [[Amram]] \u2013 Moses' father)] from Him, his name will be the Messiah '\u00cesa, the son of Maryam, held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allah.\" \u2013 [[Sura]]h 3:45, [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]] translation.\n\n====Ishmaelite Messiah====\nAccording to one version of the Gospel of Barnabas, Jesus denied being the Messiah, claiming rather that the Messiah would be Ishmaelite (i.e. Arab):\n\n{{quote|Whereupon Jesus said: \"Ye deceive yourselves; for David in spirit calleth him lord, saying thus: 'God said to my lord, sit thou on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool. God shall send forth thy rod which shall have lordship in the midst of thine enemies.' If the messenger of God whom ye call Messiah were son of David, how should David call him lord? Believe me, for verily I say to you, that the promise was made in Ishmael, not in Isaac.\"|Barnabas 43:10 [http://www.barnabas.net/index.php/chapters/436-43-promise-to-ishmael]}}\n\nHajj Sayed (Senior Member in [http://www.islamic-message.net CIMS]), in his new book in [[Egypt]], compares this to the following statement from the canonical Bible:\n\n{{quote|\"What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?\" \"The son of David\", they replied. He said to them, \"How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord'? For he says, 'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.\"' If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?\"|{{bibleref|Matthew|22:42\u201346}}}}\n\nAccording to the canonical Gospels, Jesus was the \"son\" (descendant) of David; thus, Hajj Sayed argues that this statement confirms the Gospel of Barnabas' point.\n\nThe idea of the Messiah as an Arab is also found in another chapter of Gospel of Barnabas:\n\n{{quote|If I work iniquity, reprove me, and God will love you, because you shall be doing his will, but if none can reprove me of sin it is a sign that you are not sons of Abraham as you call yourselves, nor are you incorporate with that head wherein Abraham was incorporate. As God lives, so greatly did Abraham love God, that he not only brake in pieces the false idols and forsook his father and mother, but was willing to slay his own son in obedience to God.\n\nThe high priest answered: \"This I ask of you, and I do not seek to slay you, wherefore tell us: Who was this son of Abraham?\" Jesus answered: \"The zeal of your honour, O God, inflames me, and I cannot hold my peace. Truly I say, the son of Abraham was Ishmael, from whom must be descended the Messiah promised to Abraham, that in him should all the tribes of the earth be blessed.\" Then was the high priest wroth, hearing this, and cried out: \"Let us stone this impious fellow, for he is an Ishmaelite, and has spoken blasphemy against Moses and against the Law of God.\"|Barnabas 208:1\u20132 [http://www.barnabas.net/index.php/chapters/396-208-priests-try-stoning-jesus]}}\n\nHere, one version of the Gospel of Barnabas also quotes Jesus as saying that the sacrificed son of Abraham was Ishmael not Isaac, conforming to Islamic belief but disagreeing with Jewish and Christian belief. A connection might also be drawn between the last paragraph's statement that \"in him should all the tribes of the earth be blessed\", and the meaning of the name \"Muhammad\", the \"Praised (or Blessed) One\".\n\n===Jesus is neither God nor Son of God===\nAccording to the Gospel of Barnabas, Jesus foresaw and rejected his own deification:\n\n{{quote|And having said this, Jesus smote his face with both his hands, and then smote the ground with his head. And having raised his head, he said: \"Cursed be every one who shall insert into my sayings that I am the son of God.\"|53:6 [http://www.barnabas.net/index.php/chapters/447-53-signs-of-the-judgment-day]}}\n\nThis conforms entirely with Muslim belief, according to which Jesus is just a human and a prophet. According to some [[ahadith]], he will come back to earth in the future and declare to the world that he is \"a Servant of God\".\n\n===Paul and Barnabas===\n[[File:Berchem, Nicolaes Pietersz. - Paul and Barnabas at Lystra - 1650.jpg|thumbnail|''Paul and Barnabas at Lystra'' by [[Nicolaes Pietersz. Berchem]] (1650 painting)]]\nHajj Sayed argues that the description of the conflict between Paul and Barnabas in Galatians supports the idea that the Gospel of Barnabas existed at the time of Paul. Blackhirst has suggested, by contrast, that Galatian's account of this argument could be the reason the gospel's writer attributed it to Barnabas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.depts.drew.edu/jhc/Blackhirst_Barnabas.html|title=R. Blackhirst, \"Barnabas and the Gospels: Was there an Early Gospel of Barnabas?\"|publisher=}}</ref> Paul writes in ([http://www.bbintl.org/bible/niv/nivGal2.html Galatians Chapter 2]):\n\n{{quote|When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong. Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group. The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray.|Galatians 2:11\u201314 [http://www.bbintl.org/bible/niv/nivGal2.html]}}\n\nPaul was attacking Peter for \"trying to satisfy the Jews\" by sticking to their laws, such as circumcision. It is contended that at this point Barnabas was following Peter and disagreeing with Paul. Some feel it also suggests that the inhabitants of Galatia at his time were using a gospel or gospels disagreeing with Paul's beliefs, which the Gospel of Barnabas could be one of them (although the [[Gospel of Peter]] would seem a more natural candidate, as in the light of the second letter.) To Galatian's account we may compare the Introductory Chapter of Gospel of Barnabas, where we read:\n\n{{quote|Dearly beloved the great and wonderful God hath during these past days visited us by his prophet Jesus Christ in great mercy of teaching and miracles, by reason whereof many, being deceived of Satan, under presence of piety, are preaching most impious doctrine, calling Jesus son of God, repudiating the circumcision ordained of God for ever, and permitting every unclean meat: among whom also Paul hath been deceived, whereof I speak not without grief; for which cause I am writing that truth which I have seen and heard, in the intercourse that I have had with Jesus, in order that ye may be saved, and not be deceived of Satan and perish in the judgment of God. Therefore beware of every one that preacheth unto you new doctrine contrary to that which I write, that ye may be saved eternally.|Introduction to the Gospel of Barnabas [http://www.barnabas.net/index.php/chapters/386-1-true-gospel-of-jesus]}}\n\nFrom the previous passages, it is argued that in the beginning, Paul and Barnabas were getting along with each other; but that at the end, they started to depart in their beliefs to give to the importance of the Jewish law.\n\n===Other non-canonical differences===\nAccording to the following passage, Jesus talked to Barnabas and gave him a secret:\n{{quote|Jesus, weeping, said: \"O Barnabas, it is necessary that I should reveal to you great secrets, which, after that I shall be departed from the world, you shall reveal to it.\" Then answered he that writes, weeping, and said: \"Suffer me to weep, O master, and other men also, for that we are sinners. And you, that are a holy one and prophet of God, it is not fitting for you to weep so much.\"\n\nJesus answered: \"Believe me, Barnabas that I cannot weep as much as I ought. For if men had not called me God, I should have seen God here as he will be seen in paradise, and should have been safe not to fear the day of judgment. But God knows that I am innocent, because never have I harboured thought to be held more than a poor slave. No, I tell you that if I had not been called God I should have been carried into paradise when I shall depart from the world, whereas now I shall not go thither until the judgment. Now you see if I have cause to weep.\n\n\"Know, O Barnabas, that for this I must have great persecution, and shall be sold by one of my disciples for thirty pieces of money. Whereupon I am sure that he who shall sell me shall be slain in my name, for that God shall take me up from the earth, and shall change the appearance of the traitor so that every one shall believe him to be me; nevertheless, when he dies an evil death, I shall abide in that dishonour for a long time in the world. But when Muhammad shall come, the sacred Messenger of God, that infamy shall be taken away. And this shall God do because I have confessed the truth of the Messiah who shall give me this reward, that I shall be known to be alive and to be a stranger to that death of infamy.\"|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/gbar/gbar112.htm|title=The Gospel of Barnabas - chapter 112|publisher=}}</ref>}}\n\nAlso according to the Gospel of Barnabas, Jesus charged Barnabas to write the gospel:\n{{quote|Jesus turned himself to him who writes, and said: \"Barnabas, see that by all means you write my gospel concerning all that has happened through my dwelling in the world. And write in a similar manner that which has befallen Judas, in order that the faithful may be undeceived, and every one may believe the truth.\"|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/gbar/gbar221.htm|title=The Gospel of Barnabas - chapter 221|publisher=}}</ref>}}\n\n==Anachronisms==\n[[File:Thedecapolis.png|thumb]]\nSome readers have noted that the ''Gospel of Barnabas'' contains a number of [[anachronism]]s and historical incongruities:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Slomp |first=Jan |year=1978 |title=The Gospel in Dispute.

The Gospel of Barnabas thus errs in describing Jesus as \"Jesus Christ\" (lit. \"Messiah Jesus\" in Greek), yet claiming that 'Jesus confessed and said the truth, \"I am not the Messiah\"' (ch. 42).\n* There is reference to a [[jubilee (Christian)|jubilee]] which is to be held every hundred years (Chapter 82), rather than every fifty years as described in [[Leviticus]]: 25. This anachronism appears to link the Gospel of Barnabas to the declaration of a Holy Year in 1300 by [[Pope Boniface VIII]]; a Jubilee which he then decreed should be repeated every hundred years. In 1343 the interval between Holy Years was reduced by [[Pope Clement VI]] to fifty years.<ref name=\"Ragg 1907 xiii\"/>\n* [[Adam and Eve]] eat an apple (ch. 40); whereas the traditional association of the Fruit of the [[Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil]] ([[Book of Genesis]] 2:9,17; 3:5) with the apple rests on the translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into [[Latin]], where both 'apple' and 'evil' are rendered as 'malum'.\n* The Gospel talks of wine being stored in wooden casks (chapter 152). Casks of palm wood were used by the fifth century B.C., when [[Herodotus]] shipped wine to [[Mesopotamia]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rawlinson |first=G |title=The History of Herodotus |year=1875 |publisher=D.

Nor is there a forty days' fast in Judaism of the period (see [[Mishnah]], volume [[Ta'anit (tractate)|Ta'anit]], \"Days of Fasting\").\n* Where the Gospel of Barnabas includes quotations from the [[Old Testament]], these correspond to readings as found in the Latin [[Vulgate]] rather than as found in either the Greek [[Septuagint]], or the Hebrew [[Masoretic Text]]. The Latin Vulgate translation was a work that [[St. Jerome]] began in 382 AD, centuries after the death of Barnabas.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L & L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xxiv |nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}</ref>\n*In Chapter 54 it says: \"For he would get in change a piece of gold must have sixty mites\" (Italian ''minuti''). In the New Testament period, the only golden coin, the [[aureus]], was worth approximately 3,200 of the smallest bronze coin, the [[Greek lepton|lepton]] (translated into Latin as ''minuti''); while the Roman standard silver coin, the [[denarius]], was worth 128 lepta. The rate of exchange of 1:60 implied in the Gospel of Barnabas was, however, a commonplace of late medieval interpretation of the counterpart passage in the canonical Gospels (Mark 12:42), arising from the standard medieval understanding of ''minuti'' as meaning 'a sixtieth part'.\n* Chapter 91 records three contending Jewish armies 200,000 strong at Mizpeh,<ref group=Note>The Hebrew Bible mentions several places in Judea called called [[Mizpah (disambiguation)|Mizpeh or Mizpah]]. The Gospel of Barnabas contains no conclusive evidence as to which one the author had in mind. However, [[Mizpah in Benjamin]] was near Jerusalem; and according to Chapter 91, Herod, Pilate and the High Priest (who were all based in Jerusalem) spoke to the armies.</ref> totaling 600,000 men, at a time when the Roman army across the entire Empire had a total strength estimated as 300,000.\n* In Chapter 119 Jesus instances sugar and gold as substances of equivalent rarity and value.

Nevertheless, Muslim writers{{who|date=January 2011}} sometimes note those elements of the Gospel of Barnabas that stand in accord with standard Qur'anic teaching, such as the denial of Jesus as being Son of God and the prophetic prediction by Jesus of the coming Messenger of God and, consequently, some Muslims are inclined to regard these specific elements as representing the survival of suppressed early Jesus traditions much more compatible with Islam.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reed |first=Annette Yoshiko |title=\"Muslim Gospel\" Revealing \"Christian Truth\" Excites Da Vinci Code Set |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/atheologies/7888/_muslim_gospel__revealing_the__christian_truth__excites_the_da_vinci_code_set/ | publisher=Religion Dispatches | date=May 22, 2014 | accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Possible Syriac manuscripts==\n[[File:Ethnography Museum of Ankara.jpg|thumb|left|Ethnography Museum of Ankara, where an alleged manuscript copy is held.]]\nIn 1985, it was briefly claimed that an early [[Syriac language|Syriac]] copy of this gospel had been found near [[Hakk\u00e2ri]] in eastern [[Turkey]].<ref>{{Cite news|first=Hamza |last=Bekta\u015f |title=Barnabas Bible Found |work=Ilim ve Sanat Dergisi |date=March\u2013April 1985}}</ref> However, it has since been demonstrated that this manuscript actually contains the canonical Bible.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Pankow |last=Ron |title=The Barnabas Bible |work=Arabia |date=March\u2013April 1985}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2012, it was confirmed by the [[Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] that a 52-page biblical manuscript in Syriac writing had been deposited in the [[Ethnography Museum of Ankara]].<ref name=\"Xinhuanet\">{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-02/25/c_131430464.htm|accessdate=July 9, 2013 |title=1,500-year-old handwritten newly-discovered in Turkey |work=Xinhuanet English News |date=25 February 2012 |author=Yan }}</ref> Newspaper reports in Turkey claimed that the manuscript had been found in Cyprus in 2000, in an operation conducted by police against smugglers, and had been kept in a police repository since then;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/23/vatican-requests-1500-year-old-bible-from-turkey_n_1296672.html | title=Vatican Requests 1,500-Year-Old Bible Held In Turkey | publisher=Huffington Post | date=23 February 2012 | accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref> and further speculated that the text of the manuscript could be that of the Gospel of Barnabas.

Bandy}}</ref> he was born at [[Glauchau]] in [[Saxony]]. His birth name was '''Georg Pawer''' (''Bauer'' in modern German);<ref>http://www.georgius-agricola.de/ Agricola Forschungszentrum Chemnitz</ref> ''Agricola'' is the [[Latin]]ized version of his name, by which he was known his entire adult life; ''Georgius'' and ''Georg'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 (ge\u014drg\u00f3s)''), ''Agricola'' (from Latin) and ''Bauer'' (from [[German language|German]]) all mean \"farmer\" in their respective languages. He is best known for his book ''[[De Re Metallica]]'' (1556).\n\n==Life and work==\nGifted with a precocious intellect, Agricola early threw himself into the pursuit of the \"[[new learning]]\", with such effect that at the age of 24, he was appointed Rector extraordinarius of Greek at the so-called Great School of [[Zwickau]], and made his appearance as a writer on [[philology]]. After four years, he gave up his appointment to pursue his studies at [[Leipzig]], where, as rector, he received the support of the professor of classics, [[Peter Mosellanus]] (1493\u20131525), a celebrated humanist of the time, with whom he had already been in correspondence. Here, he also devoted himself to the study of [[medicine]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]]. He went to [[Italy]] from 1524 to 1526, where he took his doctor's degree.\n\nHe returned to Zwickau in 1527, and was chosen as town physician at [[Joachimsthal]], a centre of mining and smelting works, his object being partly \"to fill in the gaps in the art of healing\", and partly to test what had been written about mineralogy by careful observation of ores and the methods of their treatment. His thorough grounding in philology and philosophy had accustomed him to systematic thinking, and this enabled him to construct out of his studies and observations of minerals a logical system which he began to publish in 1528. Agricola's dialogue ''Bermannus, sive de re metallica dialogus'' [Bermannus; or a dialogue on metallurgy], (1530) the first attempt to reduce to scientific order the knowledge won by practical work, brought Agricola into notice; it contained an approving letter from [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] at the beginning of the book.\n\nIn 1530, [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony|Prince Maurice of Saxony]] appointed him [[historiographer]] with an annual allowance, and he migrated to [[Chemnitz]], the centre of the mining industry, to widen the range of his observations. The citizens showed their appreciation of his learning by appointing him town physician in 1533. In that year, he published a book about Greek and Roman weights and measures, ''De Mensuris et Ponderibus''.\n\nHe was also elected [[burgomaster]] of Chemnitz. His popularity was, however, short-lived. Chemnitz was a violent centre of the Protestant movement, while Agricola never wavered in his allegiance to the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; he was forced to resign his office. He now lived apart from the contentious movements of the time, devoting himself wholly to learning. His chief interest was still in mineralogy, but he occupied himself also with medical, mathematical, theological and historical subjects, his chief historical work being the ''Dominatores Saxonici a prima origine ad hanc aetatem'', published at [[Freiberg]]. In 1544, he published the ''De ortu et causis subterraneorum'', in which he laid the first foundations of a physical [[geology]], and criticized the theories of the ancients.  However, he maintained that a certain 'materia pinguis' or 'fatty matter,' set into fermentation by heat, gave birth to fossil organic shapes, as opposed to fossil shells having belonged to living animals.<ref>[[wikiquote:Charles Lyell|Charles Lyell]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mmIOAAAAQAAJ& Principles of Geology]'', 1832, p.29</ref> In 1545, he followed with the ''De natura eorum quae effluunt e terra''; in 1546 the ''De veteribus et novis metallis'', a comprehensive account of the discovery and occurrence of minerals and also more commonly known as ''[[De Natura Fossilium]]''; in 1548, the ''De animantibus subterraneis''; and in the two following years a number of smaller works on the metals.\n[[Image:Georg Agricola-Titelblatt.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[De re metallica]]]]''\n[[Image:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|right|A water mill used for raising ore]]\n\n==''De re metallica''==\n{{Main|De re metallica}}\nAgricola's most famous work, the '' [[De re metallica]] libri xii'' was published the year after his death, in 1556; it was perhaps finished in 1550, since the dedication to the elector and his brother is dated to that year. The delay is thought to be due to the book's many woodcuts. The work is a systematic, illustrated treatise on [[mining]] and [[metallurgy#Extractive metallurgy|extractive metallurgy]]. It shows processes to extract [[ore]]s from the ground, and metals from ore.\n\nUntil that time, [[Pliny the Elder]]'s work ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'' was the main source of information on metals and mining techniques. Agricola acknowledged his debt to ancient authors, such as Pliny and [[Theophrastus]], and made numerous references to Roman works. In [[geology]], Agricola described and illustrated how [[ore vein]]s occur in and on the ground. He described [[prospecting]] for ore veins and [[surveying]] in detail, as well as washing the ores to collect the heavier valuable minerals, such as [[gold]] and [[tin]]. The work shows [[water mill]]s used in [[mining]], such as the machine for lifting men and material into and out of a mine shaft. Water mills found application especially in crushing ores to release the fine particles of gold and other heavy minerals, as well as working giant [[bellows]] to force air into the confined spaces of underground workings.\n\nAgricola described mining methods which are now obsolete, such as [[fire-setting]], which involved building fires against hard rock faces. The hot rock was quenched with water, and the [[thermal shock]] weakened it enough for easy removal. It was a dangerous method when used underground, and was made redundant by [[explosives]].\n[[File:Fire-setting.jpg|thumb|320px|Fire-setting underground]]\n\nThe work contains, in an appendix, the German equivalents for the technical terms used in the Latin text. Modern words that derive from the work include [[fluorspar]] (from which was later named [[fluorine]]) and [[bismuth]]. In another example, believing the black rock of the [[Schlo\u00dfberg (Stolpen)|Schlo\u00dfberg]] at [[Stolpen]] to be the same as Pliny the Elder's [[basalt]], Agricola applied this name to it, and thus originated a petrological term.\n\nIn 1912, the ''Mining Magazine'' (London) published an English translation of ''De re metallica''. The translation was made by [[Herbert Hoover]], the American mining engineer and his wife [[Lou Henry Hoover]]. Hoover was later [[President of the United States]].\n\n==Final days==\nIn spite of the early proof that Agricola had given of the tolerance of his own religious attitude, he was not suffered to end his days in peace. He remained to the end a staunch Catholic, though all Chemnitz had gone over to the Lutheran creed, and it is said that his life was ended by a fit of [[apoplexy]] brought on by a heated discussion with a Protestant divine. He died in Chemnitz on 21 November 1555; so violent was the theological feeling against him, he was not allowed to be buried in the town to which he had added such lustre. Amidst hostile demonstrations, he was carried to [[Zeitz]], some 50 kilometers away, and buried there.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of mineralogists]]\n*[[Pliny the Elder]]\n*[[Shen Kuo]]&nbsp;\u2013 an 11th-century Chinese statesman who wrote a theory of land formation involving mineralogy\n*[[Theophrastus]]\n*[[Mineral collecting]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Agricola, Christoph Ludwig}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Carolyn Merchant]] (1980).

The son of [[Nero Claudius Drusus]] and [[Antonia Minor]], Germanicus was born into an influential branch of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] [[Claudia (gens)|''gens Claudia'']]. The [[Victory title|agnomen]] ''Germanicus'' was added to his full name in 9 BC when it was posthumously awarded to his father in honor of his victories in [[Germania]]. In AD 4, he was adopted by his paternal uncle, [[Tiberius]], who succeeded [[Augustus]] as [[Roman emperor]] a decade later. As a result, Germanicus became an official member of the [[Julia (gens)|''gens Julia'']], another prominent family which he was related to on his mother's side. His connection to the Julii was further consolidated through a marriage between himself and [[Agrippina the Elder]], a granddaughter of Augustus. He was also the nephew of Tiberius, the father of [[Caligula]], and the maternal grandfather of [[Nero]].\n\nDuring the reign of Augustus, Germanicus enjoyed an accelerated political career as the heir of the emperor's heir, entering the office of [[quaestor]] five years before the legal age in AD 7. He held that office until AD 11, and was elected [[Roman consul|consul]] for the first time in AD 12. The year after, he was made [[proconsul]] of [[Germania Inferior]], [[Germania Superior]], and all of [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]]. From there he commanded eight [[Roman legion|legions]], about one-third of the entire [[Roman army]], which he led against the Germanic tribes in his [[Early Imperial campaigns in Germania|campaigns]] from AD 14 to 16. He avenged the Roman Empire's defeat in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|Teutoberg Forest]] and retrieved two of the three [[aquila (Roman)|legionary eagles]] that had been lost during the battle. In AD 17 he returned to [[Rome]] where he received a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] before leaving to reorganize the provinces of [[Asia Minor]], whereby he incorporated the provinces of [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]] and [[Kingdom of Commagene|Commagene]] in AD 18.\n\nWhile in the eastern provinces, he came into conflict with the governor of [[Roman Syria|Syria]], [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]]. During their feud, Germanicus became ill in [[Antioch]], where he died on 10 October AD 19. His death has been attributed to poison by ancient sources, but that was never proven.

Towards the end of the year, additional reinforcements arrived; three legions from [[Moesia]] commanded by [[Aulus Caecina Severus (suffect consul 1 BC)|Aulus Caecina Severus]], and two legions with Thracian cavalry and auxiliary troops from Anatolia commanded by [[Marcus Plautius Silvanus (consul 2 BC)|Silvanus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Crook|1996|p=107}}</ref><ref name=Dzino151>{{harvnb|Dzino|2010|p=151}}</ref>\n\nBy the time Germanicus had arrived in Pannonia, the rebels had resorted to raiding from the mountain fortresses to which they had withdrawn. Because the Roman legions were not so effective at countering this tactic, Tiberius deployed his auxiliary forces and divided his army into small detachments, allowing them to cover more ground and conduct a [[war of attrition]] against the rebels in their strong defensive positions. The Romans also began to drive the rebels out of the countryside, offering amnesty to those tribes that would lay down their arms, and implemented a [[scorched earth]] policy in an effort to starve the enemy out. During this period, Germanicus's detachments were in action against the [[Mazaei]], whom he defeated.<ref name=Dzino151/><ref>{{harvnb|Radman-Livaja|Dizda|2010|pp=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\nThe rebel position in Pannonia collapsed in AD 8 when one of their commanders, [[Bato the Breucian]], surrendered their leader [[Pinnes (Pannonian chieftain)|Pinnes]] to the Romans and laid down his arms in return for amnesty. This was nullified when Bato the Breucian was defeated in battle and subsequently executed by his former ally [[Bato the Daesitiate]], but this left the Pannonians divided against each other, and the Romans were able to subdue the Breuci without battle. The pacification of the Breuci, with their large population and resources, was a significant victory for the Romans, who would be reinforced by eight cohorts of Breuci auxiliaries towards the end of the war. Bato the Daesitiate withdrew from Pannonia to Dalmatia, where he occupied the mountains of [[Bosnia]] and began conducting counter-attacks, most likely against the indigenous people who sided with the Romans. Later in the year, Tiberius left [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 6)|Lepidus]] in command of Siscia and Silvanus at Sirmium.<ref>{{harvnb|Dzino|2010|pp=151\u2013152}}</ref><ref name=Dzino151/>\n\nRoman forces took the initiative in AD 9, and pushed into Dalmatia. Tiberius divided his forces into three divisions: one under Silvanus, which advanced south-east from Sirmium; another commanded by Lepidus, which advanced north-west along the Una Valley from Siscia toward [[Burnum]]; and the third led by Tiberius and Germanicus in the Dalmatian hinterland. The divisions under Lepidus and Silvanus practically exterminated the Perustae and Daesitiate in their mountain strongholds.<ref>{{harvnb|Swan|2004|p=239}}</ref> Roman forces captured many cities, and those commanded by Germanicus took Raetinum, near Seretium (although it was destroyed in a fire set by the rebels during the siege), Splonum (in modern-day northern [[Montenegro]]) and Seretium itself (in modern-day western Bosnia). The Roman forces under Tiberius and Germanicus pursued Bato to the fortress of Andretium near [[Salona]], to which they laid siege. When it became clear Bato would not surrender, Tiberius assaulted the fortress and captured him. While Tiberius negotiated the terms of surrender, Germanicus was sent on a punitive expedition across the surrounding territory, during which he forced the surrender of the fortified town of Arduba and surrounding towns. He then sent a deputy to subdue the remaining districts and returned to Tiberius.<ref>{{harvnb|Swan|2004|pp=239\u2013241}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Dzino|2010|pp=152\u2013153}}</ref>\n\n===Interim===\n[[File:Otto Albert Koch Varusschlacht 1909.jpg|200px|thumb|''Battle of Teutoburg Forest'', by Otto Albert Koch (1909).<ref>{{harvnb|Chrystal|2015|p=153}}</ref>]]\nAfter a distinguished start to his military career, Germanicus returned to Rome in late AD 9 to personally announce his victory. He was honored with a triumphal insignia (without an actual triumph) and the rank (not the actual title) of [[praetor]]. He was also given permission to be a candidate for [[Roman consul|consul]] before the regular time and the right to speak first in the Senate after the consuls.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowman|Champlin|Lintott|1996|p=110}}</ref><ref name=Swan249/> According to Cassius Dio, Germanicus was a popular quaestor because he acted as an advocate as much in capital jurisdiction cases before Augustus as he did before lesser judges in standard ''quaestiones'' (trials). He successfully defended, for example, a quastor accused of murder in AD 10 in which the prosecutor, fearing the jurors would find in favor of the defense out of deference for Germanicus, demanded a trial before Augustus.<ref>{{harvnb|Swan|2004|p=276}}</ref>\n\nIn AD 9, three Roman legions commanded by [[Publius Quinctilius Varus|Varus]] were destroyed by a coalition of German tribes led by [[Arminius]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. As [[proconsul]], Germanicus was dispatched with Tiberius to defend the empire against the Germans in AD 11. The two generals crossed the [[Rhine]], made various excursions into enemy territory and, in the beginning of autumn, recrossed the river. The campaigns of Tiberius and Germanicus in Germania in the years AD 11\u201312, combined with an alliance with the [[Marcomanni|Marcomannic federation]] of [[Marbod]], prevented the German coalition from crossing the Rhine and invading [[Gaul]] and Italy. In winter, Germanicus returned to Rome, where he was, after five mandates as quaestor and despite never having been [[aedile]] or praetor, appointed consul for the year AD 12. He shared the consulship with [[Gaius Fonteius Capito (consul AD 12)|Gaius Fonteius Capito]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|2003|pp=202\u20133}}</ref><ref name=Seager37>{{harvnb|Seager|2008|p=37}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gibson|2013|pp=80\u201382}}</ref><ref name=Swan285>{{harvnb|Swan|2004|p=285}}</ref> He continued to advocate for defendants in court during his consulship, a popular move reminiscent of his previous work defending the accused in front of Augustus.

He was accompanied, among his other generals, by Germanicus, for whom he had obtained the triumphal regalia. Unlike his adoptive brother Drusus, who received no recognition beyond being the son of a triumphator, Germanicus played a distinguished part in the celebration and was given the opportunity to display his consular insignia and triumphal ornaments.<ref name=Seager37/><ref name=Gibson82/>\n\n===Commander of Germania===\n[[File:Germania 10-12 Tiberio.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Campaigns of Tiberius and Germanicus in the years 10/11-13 CE.

In Germany, the legions in mutiny were those of the Lower Rhine under [[Aulus Caecina Severus (suffect consul 1 BC)|Aulus Caecina]] (the [[Legio V Alaudae|V Alaudae]], [[Legio XXI Rapax|XXI Rapax]], [[Legio I Germanica|I Germanica]], and [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX Valeria Victrix]]). The army of the Lower Rhine was stationed in summer quarters on the border of the [[Ubii]].<ref name=\"Wells204\"/> They had not gotten the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and when it became clear a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. Germanicus dealt with the troops in Germania, and Tiberius's son Drusus dealt with Illyricum.<ref>{{harvnb|Pettinger|2012|p=190}}</ref>\n\nThe army of the Lower Rhine sought an increase in pay, the reduction of their service to 16 years (down from 20) to mitigate the hardship of their military tasks, and vengeance against the centurions for their cruelty. After Germanicus arrived, the soldiers listed their complaints to him and attempted to proclaim him emperor. His open and affable manners made him popular with the soldiers, but he remained loyal to the emperor. When news of the mutiny reached the army of the Upper Rhine under [[Gaius Silius]] (the Legions [[Legio II Augusta|II Augusta]], [[Legio XIII Gemina|XIII Gemina]], [[Legio XVI Gallica|XVI Gallica]], and [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV Gemina]]) a meeting was held to meet their demands.

All 8 legions were given money, even if they did not demand it. Both the armies of the Lower and Upper Rhine had returned to order. It seemed prudent to satisfy the armies, but Germanicus took it a step further. In a bid to secure the loyalty of his troops, he led them on a raid against the [[Marsi (Germanic)|Marsi]], a Germanic people on the upper [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] river. Germanicus massacred the villages of the Marsi he encountered and pillaged the surrounding territory.

[[Tacitus]] says the purpose of those campaigns was to avenge the defeat of Varus at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, and not to expand Roman territory.<ref name=Wells204>{{harvnb|Wells|2003|p=204}}</ref>\n\nIn early spring AD 15, Germanicus crossed the Rhine and struck the [[Chatti]]. He sacked their capital [[Mattium]] (modern Maden near [[Gudensberg]]), pillaged their countryside, then returned to the Rhine. Sometime this year, he received word from [[Segestes]], who was held prisoner by Arminius's forces and needed help. Germanicus's troops released Segestes and took his pregnant daughter, Arminius's wife [[Thusnelda]], into captivity. Again he marched back victorious and at the direction of Tiberius, accepted the title of [[Imperator]].<ref name=Wells204/><ref>{{harvnb|Seager|2008|p=63}}</ref>\n\nArminius called his tribe, the [[Cherusci]], and the surrounding tribes to arms.

There, Germanicus and some of his men visited the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, and began burying the remains of the Roman soldiers that had been left in the open. After half a day of the work, he called off the burial of bones so that they could continue their war against the Germans.<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|2003|pp=196\u2013197}}</ref> He made his way into the heartland of the Cherusci. At a location Tacitus calls the ''pontes longi'' (\"long causeways\"), in boggy lowlands somewhere near the Ems, Arminius's troops [[Battle at Pontes Longi|attacked]] the Romans. Arminius initially caught Germanicus's cavalry in a trap, inflicting minor casualties, but the Roman infantry reinforced the rout and checked them. The fighting lasted for two days, with neither side achieving a decisive victory.

A fort on the Lippe called ''[[Aliso (Roman Fort & Vicus)|Castra Aliso]]'' was besieged, but the attackers dispersed on sight of Roman reinforcements. The Germans destroyed the nearby mound and altar dedicated to his father Drusus, but he had them both restored and celebrated funerary games with his legions in honor of his father. New barriers and earthworks were put in place, securing the area between Fort Aliso and the Rhine.<ref>{{harvnb|Tacitus|Barrett|2008|pp=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\nGermanicus commanded eight legions with Gallic and Germanic auxiliary units overland across the Rhine, up the Ems and [[Weser River|Weser]] rivers as part of his last major campaign against Arminius in AD 16. His forces met those of Arminius on the plains of [[Idistaviso]], by the Weser River near modern [[Rinteln]], in an engagement called the [[Battle of the Weser River]]. Tacitus says that the battle was a Roman victory:<ref name=Wells2>{{harvnb|Wells|2003|p=206}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tacitus|Barrett|2008|p=57}}</ref> {{Quote|text=the enemy were slaughtered from the fifth hour of daylight to nightfall, and for ten miles the ground was littered with corpses and weapons.|author=Tacitus|source={{harv|Wells|2003|p=206}}}}\n\nArminius and his uncle [[Inguiomer]] were both wounded in the battle but evaded capture. The Roman soldiers involved on the battlefield honored Tiberius as [[Imperator]], and raised a pile of arms as a trophy with the names of the defeated tribes inscribed beneath them.<ref>{{harvnb|Tacitus|Barrett|2008|p=58}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Seager|2008|p=70}}</ref>\n\nThe sight of the Roman trophy constructed on the battlefield enraged the Germans who were preparing to retreat beyond the [[Elbe]], and they launched an attack on the Roman positions at the [[Angrivarian Wall]], thus beginning a [[Battle of the Angrivarian Wall|second battle]]. The Romans had anticipated the attack and again routed the Germans. Germanicus stated that he did not want any prisoners, as the extermination of the Germanic tribes was the only conclusion he saw for the war. The victorious Romans then raised a mound with the inscription: \"The army of Tiberius Caesar, after thoroughly conquering the tribes between the Rhine and the Elbe, has dedicated this monument to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and [[Augustus]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Tacitus|Barrett|2008|pp=58\u201360}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Dyck|2015|p=154}}</ref>\n\nGermanicus sent some troops back to the Rhine, with some of them taking the land route, but most of them took the fast route and traveled by boat. They went down the Ems toward the North Sea, but as they reached the sea, a storm struck, sinking many of the boats and killing many men and horses.<ref name=Wells2/>\n\nThen Germanicus ordered [[Caius Silius]] to march against the Chatti with a mixed force of 3,000 cavalry and 33,000 infantry and lay waste to their territory, while he himself, with a larger army, invaded the Marsi for the third time and devastated their land. He forced [[Mallovendus]], the defeated leader of the Marsi, to reveal the location of another of the three legion's eagles lost in AD 9. Immediately Germanicus despatched troops to recover it. The Romans advanced into the country, defeating any foe they encountered.<ref>{{harvnb|Tacitus|Barrett|2008|p=61}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Seager|2008|p=72}}</ref>\n\nGermanicus's successes in Germany had made him popular with the soldiers. He had dealt a significant blow to Rome's enemies, quelled an uprising of troops, and returned lost standards to Rome. His actions had increased his fame, and he had become very popular with the Roman people. Tiberius took notice, and had Germanicus recalled to Rome and informed him that he would be given a triumph and reassigned to a different command.<ref name=Shotter>{{harvnb|Shotter|2004|pp=35\u201337}}</ref>\n\n====Result====\nWhile Germanicus enjoyed some success in his campaigns against Arminius and his allies, Tiberius decided not to attempt to conquer the Germans and recalled Germanicus to Rome. The effort it would have taken to conquer [[Germania Magna]] was deemed too great when compared with the low potential for profit from acquiring the new territory. Rome regarded Germany as a wild territory of forests and swamps, with little wealth compared to territories Rome already had.<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|2003|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref> However, the campaign significantly healed the Roman psychological trauma from the Varus disaster, and greatly recovered Roman prestige. In addition to the recovery of two of the three lost eagles, Germanicus had fought Arminius, the leader who destroyed the three Roman legions in 9 AD, and defeated him in numerous battles. In leading his troops across the Rhine without recourse to Tiberius, he contradicted the advice of Augustus to keep that river as the boundary of the empire, and opened himself to potential doubts from Tiberius about his motives in taking such independent action. This error in political judgment gave Tiberius reason to controversially recall his nephew.<ref name=Shotter/> Tacitus attributed the recall to Tiberius's jealousy of the glory Germanicus had acquired, and, with some bitterness, claims that Germanicus could have completed the conquest of Germania had he been given full operational independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowman|Champlin|Lintott|1996|p=209}}</ref>\n\n===Recall===\n[[Image:Carl Theodor von Piloty Thusnelda im Triumphzug des Germanicus.jpg|thumb|right|''Thusnelda at the Triumph of Germanicus'', by [[Karl von Piloty]], 1873.<ref name=Beard108>{{harvnb|Beard|2007|p=108}}</ref>]]\nAt the beginning of AD 17, Germanicus returned to the capital and on May 26 he celebrated a triumph for his victories over the Germans. He had captured a few important prisoners, but Arminius was still at large. It was far from clear that Germanicus had won the war. Nonetheless, this did not take away from the spectacle of his triumph: a near contemporary calendar marks 26 May as the day in \"which Germanicus Caesar was borne into the city in triumph\", while coins issued under his son Gaius (Caligula) depicted him on a triumphal chariot, with the reverse reading \"Standards Recovered.

As a result, in AD 18, Germanicus was granted the eastern part of the empire, just as [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and Tiberius had received before, when they were successors to the emperor.<ref>{{harvnb|Alston|1998|p=25}}</ref>\n\n===Command in Asia===\n[[File:Roman East 50-en.svg|thumb|left|Map of Armenia and the Roman client states in eastern Asia Minor.]]\nFollowing his triumph, Germanicus was sent to [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] to reorganize the provinces and kingdoms there, which were in such disarray that the attention of a ''domus Augusta'' was deemed necessary to settle matters.<ref group=note>''Domus Augusta'' (lit. \"House of Augustus\") was the family of Tiberius including cognate relations {{harv|Cascio|2005|p=140}}.</ref> Germanicus was given ''imperium maius'' (extraordinary command) over the other governors and commanders of the area he was to operate; however, Tiberius had replaced the governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] with Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, who was meant to be his helper (''adiutor''), but turned out to be hostile.<ref name=Lott1>{{harvnb|Lott|2012|p=342}}</ref> According to Tacitus, this was an attempt to separate Germanicus from his familiar troops and weaken his influence, but the historian [[Richard Alston (classicist)|Richard Alston]] says Tiberius had little reason to undermine his heir.<ref>{{harvnb|Alston|1998|pp=25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nGermanicus had a busy year in 17. He restored a temple of [[Spes]],<ref name=Lott1/> and allegedly won a chariot race in the name of Tiberius at the [[Ancient Olympics|Olympic games]] that year. However, Eusebius, our main reference for this, does not name Germanicus, and Tacitus makes no reference to this occasion either, which would have required Germanicus to make two trips to Greece within a year.<ref>{{harv|Barrett|1993|p=12}}; Eusebius, Chronicon 70, List of the Olympiad victors, cited also by Golden, M., (2004) Sport in the Ancient World from A to Z, Routledge, London. Also, </ref>. Not waiting to take up his consulship in Rome, he left after his triumph but before the end of AD 17. He sailed down the Illyrian coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] to [[Roman Greece|Greece]]. He arrived at [[Nicopolis]] near the site of the [[Battle of Actium]], where he took up his second consulship on 18 January AD 18.<ref>Tacitus, Annals 2.53ff</ref> He visited the sites associated with his adoptive grandfather Augustus and his natural grandfather [[Mark Antony]], before crossing the sea to [[Lesbos]] and then to Asia Minor. There he visited the site of [[Troy]] and the oracle of [[Apollo|Apollo Claros]] near [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]. Piso left at the same time as Germanicus, but traveled directly to Athens and then to [[Rhodes]] where he and Germanicus met for the first time. From there Piso left for Syria where he immediately began replacing the officers with men loyal to himself in a bid to win the loyalty of his soldiers.<ref name=\"Lott1\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Barrett|1993|p=12}}</ref>\n\nNext Germanicus traveled through Syria to [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] where he installed king [[Artaxias III|Artaxias]] as a replacement for [[Vonones I|Vonones]], whom Augustus had deposed and placed under house arrest at the request of the king of [[Parthia]], [[Artabanus III (of Parthia)|Artabanus]]. The king of [[Kingdom of Cappadocia|Cappadocia]] died too, whereupon Germanicus sent [[Quintus Veranius (governor of Cappadocia)|Quintus Veranius]] to organize Cappadocia as a province \u2013 a profitable endeavor as Tiberius was able to reduce the sales tax down to .5% from 1%. The revenue from the new province was enough to make up the difference lost from lowering the sales tax. The Kingdom of Commagene was split on whether or not to remain free or to become a province with both sides sending deputations, so Germanicus sent [[Quintus Servaeus]] to organize the province.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrett|1993|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Barrett|2015|p=50}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Seager|2008|p=85}}</ref>\n\nHaving settled these matters he traveled to [[Cyrrhus]], a city in Syria between Antioch and the [[Euphrates]], where he spent the rest of AD 18 in the winter quarters of the [[Legio X Fretensis|Legion X Fretensis]]. Evidently here Piso attended Germanicus, and quarreled because he failed to send troops to Armenia when ordered. Artabanus sent an envoy to Germanicus requesting that Vonones be moved further from Armenia as to not incite trouble there. Germanicus complied, moving Vonones to [[Cilicia]], both to please Artabanus and to insult Piso, with whom Vonones was friendly.<ref name=Lott343>{{harvnb|Lott|2012|p=343}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Barrett|1993|p=50}}</ref>\n\n====Egypt====\n[[File:Nicolas Poussin 019.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Nicholas Poussin]], ''The Death of Germanicus'' (1628), oil painting.

He had gone there to relieve a famine in the country vital to Rome's food supply. The move upset Tiberius, because it had violated an order by Augustus that no senator shall enter the province without consulting the emperor and the Senate (Egypt was an imperial province, and belonged to the emperor).<ref group=note>That he violated this order is possibly confirmed by the fact that the trip is omitted in Germanicus's ''[[res gestae]]'' in the ''Senatus Consultum de memoria honoranda Germanini Caesaris'', a commemorative decree issued by the Senate and approved by Tiberius following his death {{harv|Lott|2012|p=343}}.</ref> Germanicus entered the province in his capacity as proconsul without first seeking permission to do so. He returned to Syria by summer, where he found that Piso had either ignored or revoked his orders to the cities and legions. Germanicus in turn ordered Piso's recall to Rome, although this action was probably beyond his authority.<ref name=Lott343/><ref>{{harvnb|Shotter|2004|p=38}}</ref>\n\nIn the midst of this feud, Germanicus became ill and despite the fact Piso had removed himself to the port of [[Seleucia Pieria|Seleucia]], he was convinced that Piso was somehow poisoning him. Tacitus reports that there were signs of black magic in Piso's house with hidden body parts and Germanicus's name inscribed on lead tablets. Germanicus sent Piso a letter formally renouncing their friendship (''amicitia''). Germanicus died soon after on 10 October of that year.<ref name=Lott343/> His death aroused much speculation, with several sources blaming Piso, acting under orders from Emperor Tiberius. This was never proven, and Piso later died while facing trial. Tacitus says Tiberius was involved in a conspiracy against Germanicus, and Tiberius's jealousy and fear of his nephew's popularity and increasing power was the true motive.<ref>{{harvnb|Lott|2012|p=40}}</ref>\n\nThe death of Germanicus in dubious circumstances greatly affected Tiberius's popularity in Rome, leading to the creation of a climate of fear in Rome itself. Also suspected of connivance in his death was Tiberius's chief advisor, [[Sejanus]], who would, in the 20s, create an atmosphere of fear in Roman noble and administrative circles by the use of treason trials and the role of ''delatores,'' or informers.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|Heichelheim|Yeo|2010|p=297}}</ref>\n\n==Post mortem==\n[[File:Benjamin West 001.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Benjamin West]], ''Agrippina landing at Brundisium with the Ashes of Germanicus'' (1766), oil on canvas.\n [[Yale University]] Art Gallery, [[New Haven]].<ref>{{harvnb|Facos|2011|p=29}}</ref>]]\nWhen Rome had received word of Germanicus's death, the people began observing an ''[[justitium|iustitium]]'' before the Senate had officially declared it. Tacitus says this shows the true grief that the people of Rome felt, and this also shows that by this time the people already knew the proper way to commemorate dead princes without an edict from a magistrate. At his funeral, there were no procession statues of Germanicus. There were abundant eulogies and reminders of his fine character and a particular eulogy was given by Tiberius himself in the Senate.<ref name=Lott19>{{harvnb|Lott|2012|p=19}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Levick|2012|p=105}}</ref>\n\nThe historians Tacitus and [[Suetonius]] record the funeral and posthumous honors of Germanicus. His name was placed into the [[Carmen Saliare]], and onto the [[Curule chair]]s that were placed with oaken garlands over them as honorary seats for the Augustan priesthood. His ivory statue was at the head of the procession during the Circus Games; his posts as priest of Augustus and [[Augur]] were to be filled by members of the imperial family; knights of Rome gave his name to a block of seats at a theatre in Rome, and rode behind his effigy on 15 July AD 20.<ref>{{harvnb|Lott|2012|p=241}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ando|Tuori|Plessis|2016|p=302}}</ref>\n\nAfter consulting with his family, Tiberius made his wishes known whereupon the Senate collected the honors into a commemorative decree, the ''Senatus Consultum de memoria honoranda Germanini Caesaris'', and ordered the consuls of AD 20 to issue a public law honoring the death of Germanicus, the ''Lex Valeria Aurelia''. Although Tacitus stressed the honors paid to him, the funeral and processions were carefully modeled after those of [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] and [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]], [[Marcus Vispanius Agrippa|Agrippa's]] sons. This served to emphasize the continuation of the ''domus Augusta'' across the transition from Augustus to Tiberius. Commemorative arches were built in his honor and not just at Rome, but at the frontier on the Rhine and in Asia where he had governed in life. The arch of the Rhine was placed alongside of that of his father, where the soldiers had built a funerary monument honoring him. Portraits of him and his natural father were placed in the [[Temple of Apollo Palatinus|Temple of Apollo]] on the [[Palatine]] in Rome.<ref name=Lott19/><ref>{{harvnb|Gibson|2013|p=55}}</ref>\n\nOn the day of Germanicus's death his sister Livilla gave birth to twins by Drusus. The oldest was named Germanicus and died young. In 37, Germanicus's only remaining son, Caligula, became emperor and renamed September ''Germanicus'' in honor of his father.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrett|1993|p=61}}</ref> Many Romans, in the account of Tacitus, considered Germanicus to be their equivalent to Alexander the Great, and believed that he would have easily surpassed the achievements of Alexander had he become emperor.<ref name=Barrett20/> In book eight of his ''Natural History'', Pliny connects Germanicus, Augustus, and Alexander as fellow equestrians: when Alexander's horse [[Bucephalus]] died he named a city, [[Bucephalia]], in his honor. Less monumental, Augustus's horse received a funeral mound, which Germanicus wrote a poem about.<ref>{{harvnb|Heckel|Tritle|2009|p=261}}</ref>\n\n===Trial of Piso===\nPiso was rumored to have been responsible for his death. As accusations accumulated, it was not long before the well known accuser, [[Lucius Fulcinius Trio]], brought charges against him. The Pisones were longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with Octavian early on. The continued support of the Pisones and his own friendship to Piso made Tiberius hesitant to hear the case himself. After briefly hearing both sides, Tiberius deferred the case to the Senate, making no effort to hide his deep anger toward Piso. Tiberius made allowances for Piso to summon witnesses of all social orders, including slaves, and he was given more time to plea than the prosecutors, but it made no difference: before the trial was over Piso died, ostensibly by suicide, but Tacitus supposes Tiberius may have had him murdered before he could implicate the emperor in Germanicus's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Shotter|2004|pp=41\u201344}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Levick|1999|p=123}}</ref>\n\nThe accusations brought against Piso are numerous, including:<ref name=Rowe>{{harvnb|Rowe|2002|pp=9\u201317}}</ref><ref group=note>Despite the exhaustive list only two statutes are mentioned: that of Piso violating Germanicus's ''[[imperium]]'', as he officially held greater authority despite both of them being of proconsular rank; and [[treason]], which violated the ''[[lex Iulia maiestatis]]'' for moving troops out of his province without authorization to wage war ({{harvnb|Rowe|2002|p=11}} and {{harvnb|Ando|Tuori|Plessis|2016|p=340}}).</ref>\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Insubordination]] \n*[[Corruption]] \n*Abandoning and reentering a province \n*[[Summary judgment|Summary justice]] \n*Destroying military discipline \n*Misusing the ''fiscus principis'' (emperor's money) \n*Fomenting civil war \n*Violating the divinity of ''[[Divus Augustus]]'' ([[sacrilege]]).\n{{colend}}\n\nHe was found guilty and punished posthumously for the crime of [[treason]]. The Senate had his property proscribed, forbade mourning on his account, removed images of his likeness, such as statues and portraits, and his name was erased from the base of one statue in particular as part of his ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. Yet, in a show of clemency not unlike that of the emperor, the Senate had Piso's property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 [[sesterces]] as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property. His wife Placina was absolved.<ref name=Rowe/><ref>{{harvnb|Ando|Tuori|Plessis|2016|p=340}}</ref>\n\n==Literary activity==\n[[File:Aratea 42v.jpg|thumb|''[[Pleiades]]'' of the [[Leiden Aratea]], an illustrated manuscript of Germanicus's ''Phaenomena'' dating to the 9th century.]]\nIn AD 4, Germanicus wrote a Latin version of [[Aratus]]'s ''Phainomena'', which survives, wherein he rewrites the contents of the original. For example, he replaces the opening hymn to [[Zeus]] with a passage in honor of the Roman emperor.<ref>{{harvnb|Possanza|2004|p=10}}</ref> He avoided writing in the poetic style of [[Cicero]], who had translated his own version of the ''Phainomena'', and he wrote in a new style to meet the expectations of a Roman audience whose tastes were shaped by \"modern\" authors like Ovid and [[Virgil]].<ref>{{harvnb|Possanza|2004|p=116}}</ref> For his work, Germanicus is ranked among Roman writers on [[astrology|astronomy]], and his work was popular enough for [[scholia]] to be written on it well into the Medieval era.<ref>{{harvnb|Dekker|2013|p=4}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\nGermanicus and Tiberius are often contrasted by ancient historians and poets who wrote using themes found in [[drama]], with Germanicus playing the [[tragic hero]] and Tiberius the [[tyrant]]. The endurance of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid particularly to their leadership styles, i.e., in their relationship with the masses. Germanicus is painted as a competent leader able to handle the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.<ref name=Miller>{{harvnb|Miller|Woodman|2010|pp=11\u201313}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mehl|2011|p=146}}</ref>\n\nDespite the poetics attached to Germanicus by ancient authors, it is accepted by historians such as Anthony Barrett that Germanicus was an able general. He fought against the Pannonians under Tiberius, quelled the mutiny in the Rhine, and led three successful campaigns into Germania. As for his popularity, he was popular enough that the mutinous legions of the Rhine attempted to proclaim him emperor in AD 14; however, he remained loyal and led them against the German tribes instead. Tacitus and Suetonius claim that Tiberius was jealous of Germanicus's popularity, but Barrett suggests their claim might be contradicted by the fact that, following his campaigns in Germany, Germanicus was given command of the eastern provinces \u2013 a sure sign he was intended to rule. In accordance with the precedent set by Augustus, Agrippa had been given command of those same provinces in the east when Agrippa was the intended successor to the empire.<ref name=Barrett1>{{harvnb|Barrett|1993|pp=19\u201320}}</ref>\n\n===Publius Cornelius Tacitus===\n[[File:Bronze statue of Germanicus at Amelia April 2016.jpg|thumb|Bronze statue of Germanicus on display at [[:it:Museo civico di Amelia]], ''[[Amelia, Umbria]]'', Italy.]]\n{{main|Annals (Tacitus)}}\nThe ''Annals'' by Tacitus is one of the most detailed accounts of Germanicus's campaigns against the Germans. He wrote his account in the early years of the second century. Tacitus described Germanicus as a fine general who was kind and temperate, saying that his early death had taken a great ruler from Rome.<ref name=Wells42/>\n\nBook 1 of ''Annals'' extensively focuses on the mutinies of the legions in Pannonia and Germany (AD 14). The riotous army figures into the unpredictable wrath of the Roman people giving Tiberius the chance to reflect on what it means to lead. It serves to contrast the \"old-fashioned\" [[Roman Republic|Republican]] values assigned to Germanicus, and the imperial values possessed by Tiberius. The mood of the masses is a recurring theme, with their reactions to the fortunes of Germanicus being a prominent feature of the relationship between him and Tiberius well into the ''Annals'' (as far as ''Annals'' 3.19).<ref name=Miller/>\n\n===Suetonius Tranquillus===\nSuetonius was an equestrian who held administrative posts during the reigns of [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]]. ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'' details a biographical history of the principate from the birth of [[Julius Caesar]] to the death of [[Domitian]] in AD&nbsp;96. Like Tacitus, he drew upon the imperial archives, as well as histories by [[Aufidius Bassus]], [[Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and Augustus's own letters.<ref>{{harvnb|Suetonius|Edwards|2008|p=ii}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rutledge|2013|p=xxxii}}</ref>\n\nThe attitude of Suetonius toward Germanicus's personality and moral temperament is that of adoration. He dedicates a good portion of his ''Life of Caligula'' to Germanicus, claiming Germanicus's physical and moral excellence surpassed that of his contemporaries. Suetonius also says that Germanicus was a gifted writer, and that despite all these talents, he remained humble and kind.<ref name=Barrett1/>\n\n==Legacy==\nDue to his prominence as heir to the imperial succession, he is depicted in many works of art.

Castagnoli, ''Il Cardinale Giulio Alberoni'', 3 vols., 1929-32.</ref> He is known also for being a remarkable soldier and great gourmet who advised the Spanish court on table manners and menus.\n\n==Early years==\nHe was born near [[Piacenza]], probably at the village of [[Fiorenzuola d'Arda]] in the [[Duchy of Parma]].\n\nHis father was a gardener,<ref name=Chambers>\"Alberoni, Giulio''[[Chambers's Encyclop\u00e6dia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 223.</ref> and he himself became first connected with the church in the humble position of a [[bellringer]] and [[verger]] in the [[Duomo di Piacenza|Duomo of Piacenza]]; he was twenty-one when the judge Ignazio Gardini, of Ravenna, was banished, and he followed Gardini to Ravenna, where he met the vice-legate [[Giorgio Barni]], who was made [[bishop of Piacenza]] in 1688 and appointed Alberoni chamberlain of his household. Alberoni took priest's orders, and afterwards accompanied the son of his patron to [[Rome]].\n\nDuring the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] Alberoni laid the foundation of his political success by the services he rendered to [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vend\u00f4me|Louis-Joseph, duc de Vend\u00f4me]], commander of the French forces in Italy, to whom the [[Francesco Farnese, Duke of Parma|duke of Parma]] had sent him. That a low-ranking priest was used as envoy was due to the duke's rude manners: the previous envoy, the [[bishop of Parma]], had quit because the duke had wiped his buttocks in front of him: [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] in his M\u00e9moires relates that Alberoni gained Vend\u00f4me's favor when he was received in the same way, but reacted adroitly by kissing the duke's buttocks and crying \"O culo di angelo!\". The duke was amused, and this joke started Alberoni's brilliant career. When the French forces were recalled in 1706, he accompanied the duke to [[Paris]], where he was favourably received by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].\n\n==Middle years==\n[[File:Affresco contro il Card. Alberoni Palazzo Pubblico San Marino.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Anti-Alberoni fresco, from the Palace San Marino]]\nAlberoni accompanied Vend\u00f4me to Spain as his secretary and became very active in promoting the cause of the French candidate [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]]. Following Vend\u00f4me's death, in 1713 he was made a [[Count]] and appointed Consular agent for Parma at Philip's court where he was a Royal favourite. \n\nUnder the terms of the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]], Philip became King of Spain but the Spanish Empire was effectively partitioned. [[Southern_Netherlands|The Southern Netherlands]] and their Italian possessions were ceded to the [[Habsburg_Monarchy|Austrian Hapsburgs]] and [[Savoy]], [[Menorca]] and [[Gibraltar]] went to Britain while British merchants gained trading rights in the previously closed market of the Spanish Americas. \n\nAt this time, the key powerbroker at the Spanish court was [[Marie-Anne de la Tr\u00e9moille, princesse des Ursins|Marie-Anne de la Tr\u00e9moille, Princesse des Ursins]] who dominated Phillip and his wife [[Maria Luisa of Savoy]]. Alberoni worked with her and when Maria Luisa died in 1714 they arranged for Philip to marry [[Elizabeth Farnese|Elisabetta Farnese]], daughter of the Duke of Parma.\n\nElisabetta was a strong personality herself and formed an alliance with Alberoni, their first action being to banish the Princesse des Ursins.<ref>E Armstrong, \"The Influence of Alberoni in the Disgrace of the Princess des Ursins\" ''English Historical Review'', 1890.</ref> By the end of 1715, Alberoni had been made a Duke and [[Grandee|grandee of Spain]], a member of the King's council, [[Bishop of M\u00e1laga]] and Chief Minister. In July 1717, [[Pope Clement XI]] appointed him Cardinal, allegedly because of his assistance in resolving several ecclesiastical disputes between Rome and Madrid in favour of Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=George|title=Lives of Cardinal Alberoni, the Duke of Ripperda and Marquis of Pombal|date=1814|publisher=Forgotten Books|oclc=22667803|page=33|edition=2017|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mqFQAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=cardinal+alberoni&source=bl&ots=FobQw1xXpE&sig=Xnw7kHD8p6VsPWvmPU3_Fbxyfpk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiMsOzuxrLZAhUIfMAKHf3lCPAQ6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&q=cardinal%20alberoni&f=false}}</ref> \n\nOne outcome of the war was to reduce the powers of [[Council_of_Castile|Castile]] and [[Council_of_Aragon|Aragon]] and create a Spanish state similar to the centralised French system. This allowed Alberoni to copy the economic reforms of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] and he passed a series of decrees aimed at restoring the Spanish economy. These abolished internal custom-houses, promoted trade with [[Council_of_the_Indies|the Americas]], instituted a regular mail service to the colonies and reorganised state finances along lines established by the French economist [[Jean Orry]]. Some attempts were made to satisfy Spanish conservatives eg a new School of Navigation was reserved for the sons of the nobility. \n\n[[File:The Battle of Cape Passaro.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Cape Passaro]], 11 August 1718; the destruction of the Spanish fleet off Sicily]]\n\nThese reforms made Spain confident enough to attempt the recovery of territories in Italy ceded to [[Savoy]] and [[Charles VI of Austria]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harcourt-Smith|first1=Simon|title=Cardinal of Spain: The Life and Strange Career of Alberoni|date=1944|publisher=Knopf|page=3 passim}}</ref> In 1717, a Spanish force occupied [[Sardinia]] unopposed; neither Austria or Savoy had significant naval forces and Austria was engaged in the [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716\u201318]]. This assumed the British would not intervene but when 38,000 Spanish troops landed on Sicily in 1718, Britain declared it a violation of Utrecht. On 2 August 1718, Britain, France, the Netherlands and the Austrians formed the [[Quadruple Alliance (1718)|Quadruple Alliance]] and on 11 August the Royal Navy destroyed a Spanish fleet off Sicily at the [[Battle of Cape Passaro]].  \n\nAlberoni now attempted to offset British in the Mediterranean by sponsoring a [[Jacobite_rising_of_1719|Jacobite landing]] to divert their naval resources; he also sought to end the [[Anglo-French_Alliance_(1716\u20131731)|1716 Anglo-French Alliance ]] by using the [[Cellamare Conspiracy]] to replace the current French Regent [[Philippe_II,_Duke_of_Orl\u00e9ans|the Duke of Orleans]] with Phillip of Spain. However, he failed to appreciate that Britain was now powerful enough to maintain naval superiority in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic while France declared war on Spain in December 1718 on discovery of the Conspiracy. \n\nFrance invaded eastern Spain and in October 1719 a British naval expedition captured the Spanish port of [[Capture of Vigo|Vigo]]; they landed 6,000 troops, held Vigo for ten days, destroyed vast quantities of stores and equipment and then re-embarked unopposed. The nearby city of [[Santiago de Compostela]] even paid \u00a340,000 in return for being left alone.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rodger|first1=NAM|title=The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649-1815; Volume 2.|date=2006|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780141026909|page=229}}</ref> As intended, this was a crushing demonstration of British naval power and showed the Spanish Britain could land anywhere along their coastline and leave when they wanted to. <ref>{{cite book|last1=Simms|first1=Brendan|title=Three Victories and a Defeat: The Rise and Fall of the First British Empire, 1714-1783.|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780140289848|page=141}}</ref> The failure of his policy meant Alberoni was dismissed on 5 December 1719 and ordered to leave Spain, with [[Treaty_of_The_Hague_(1720)|the Treaty of The Hague]] in 1720 confirming the outcome of Utrecht.\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Giulio Alberoni.jpg|thumb|Print of Cardinal Alberoni]][[File:Giulio-Alberoni-Ontwerp-van-den-kardinaal-Alberoni-om-het-Turksche-ryk MG 1208.tif|thumb|Engraving of Cardinal Alberoni]]\nHe went to Italy, escaped from arrest at Genoa, and had to take refuge among the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], [[Pope Clement XI]], who was his bitter enemy, having given strict orders for his arrest. On the death of Clement in 1721, Alberoni boldly appeared at the conclave, and took part in the election of [[Pope Innocent XIII|Innocent XIII]], after which he was for a short time imprisoned by the new pontiff on the demand of Spain on charges including [[sodomy]] ([[Elizabeth Charlotte, Madame Palatine|Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatine]] noted in her diaries that he was a [[pederast]]).<ref>Eugene Marie, \"L'amore omosessuale\", 1983</ref> He was ultimately cleared by a commission of his fellow Cardinals. At the next election (1724) he was himself proposed for the papal chair, and secured ten votes at the conclave that elected [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]].\n\nBenedict's successor, [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII]] (elected 1730), named him legate of [[Ravenna]], where he erected the Porta Alberoni (1739), a magnificent gateway that formerly provided access to the city's dockyards, and has since been moved to the entrance of the Teatro Rasi.<ref>http://www.racine.ra.it/ravenna/english/keys/historical/porta_alberoni_uk.htm {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112030139/http://www.racine.ra.it/ravenna/english/keys/historical/porta_alberoni_uk.htm |date=November 12, 2004 }}; G.

Since leprosy had nearly disappeared in Italy, Alberoni obtained the consent of the pope to suppress the hospital, which had fallen into great disorder, and replaced it with a seminary for the priestly education of seventy poor boys, under the name of the Collegio Alberoni, which it still bears. The Cardinal's collections of art gathered in Rome and Piacenza, housed in his richly appointed private apartments, have been augmented by the Collegio.  There are remarkable suites of Flemish tapestries, and paintings, among which the most famous is the ''Ecce Homo'' by [[Antonello da Messina]] (1473), but which also include panels by [[Jan Provoost]] and other Flemish artists, oil paintings by [[Domenico Maria Viani]] and [[Francesco Solimena]].\n\nAlberoni was a gourmet. Interspersed in his official correspondence with Parma are requests for local delicacies ''triffole'' ([[truffles]]), [[salame]], robiola cheeses, and ''[[agnolini]]''  (kind of pasta).<ref>http://www.comune.piacenza.it/english/localcusine.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622042943/http://www.comune.piacenza.it/english/localcusine.htm |date=June 22, 2007 }}</ref> The pork dish ''\"[[Coppa del Cardinale]]\"'', a specialty of Piacenza, is named for him.

He left the rest of the immense wealth he had acquired in [[Spain]] to his nephew. Alberoni produced many  [[manuscript]]s.

He was the son of Gil \u00c1llvarez de Albornoz and of Do\u00f1a Teresa de Luna, sister of Jimeno de Luna, [[archbishop of Toledo]] and a member of the prominent [[House of Carrillo|Carrillo family]]. He was educated at [[Zaragoza, Spain|Zaragoza]], while his uncle was bishop of that see, and studied law at [[Toulouse]].<ref name=Ott>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06558a.htm Ott, Michael. \"Alvarez Carillo Gil de Albornoz.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 30 Jul. 2015</ref>\n\nThe powerful influence of his family opened him a public career early in life. He was made archdeacon of [[Order of Calatrava|Calatrava]], and became a member of the king's council while young. In 1338 he was chosen [[archbishop]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in succession to his uncle by the favour of the king, [[Alfonso XI of Castile]]. At the [[battle of Rio Salado]] he successfully fought against a [[Marinid]] invasion from [[Morocco]] in 1340, and at the taking of Algeciras in 1344 he led the armed levy of his archbishopric.<ref name=Ott/>\n\nAs Archbishop of Toledo he held two reform synods; one at Toledo in May 1339, the other at Alcal\u00e1 in April 1347. In 1343 he had been sent to [[Pope Clement VI]] at [[Avignon]] to negotiate a grant of a tax on the revenues of the Church for the Crusade. Albornoz left [[Spain]] on the death of the king Alfonso XI in March 1350, and never returned. It has been said, but not on contemporary evidence, that he fled from fear of [[Pedro of Castile]]. His military and diplomatic ability became known to the pope, who made him a cardinal-priest of S. Clemente in December of that year, at which point he resigned the archbishopric of Toledo.<ref name=Ott/>\n\nHe was appointed [[grand penitentiary]] shortly after election of [[Pope Innocent VI]] in December 1352 and given the epithet \"Angel of Peace\", a title which quickly became an ironic misnomer given his future campaigns in the Papal States.\n\n===First campaign in Italy===\nIn 1353 [[Pope Innocent VI|Innocent VI]] sent him as a legate into [[Italy]], with a view to the restoration of the papal authority in the states of the Church, at the head of a small mercenary army. After receiving the support of the archbishop of Milan, [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop)|Giovanni Visconti]], and of those of Pisa, Florence and Siena, he started a campaign against [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of [[Viterbo]], who had usurped much of the Papal territories in the Latium and Umbria. Giovanni was defeated in the battle of Viterbo of 10 March 1354 and signed a treaty of submission. \n\nAlbornoz then moved to the [[Marche]] and [[Romagna]] against the [[House of Malatesta|Malatesta]] of [[Rimini]] and the [[Ordelaffi]] of [[Forl\u00ec]]. The Papal commander [[Rodolfo II da Varano]], lord of [[Camerino]], defeated [[Galeotto I Malatesta|Galeotto Malatesta]], forcing his family to become a loyal ally of the Pope. This was followed by the submission of the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the [[da Polenta]] of [[Ravenna]], and of the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]]. Towards the end of 1356 Albornoz was appointed as [[bishop of Sabina]].\n\nOnly [[Giovanni Manfredi]] of [[Faenza]] and [[Francesco II Ordelaffi]] of [[Forl\u00ec]] were at that point resisting the Papal reconquest. Albornoz had managed to submit only the former when he was being recalled in 1357, being replaced by Androin de la Roche, [[abbot of Cluny]]. Before leaving, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars held on 29 April 1357, Albornoz issued the ''[[Constitutiones Sanct\u00e6 Matris Ecclesi\u00e6]]'', which regulated all the matters of the Papal States and its division into provinces. They remained effective until 1816.\n\n===Second campaign in Italy===\nThe Cardinal was honoured as ''Pater Ecclesi\u00e6'' at his arrival in Avignon. His sojourn there was to be short, however, as Giovanni di Vico and Francesco Ordelaffi (who had hired the famous [[condottiero]] [[Konrad von Landau]]'s \"Grand Company\") were menacing the fragile balance of his last conquests. Returned to Italy, Albornoz found an agreement with Landau, forcing Ordelaffi to surrender on 4 July 1359.\n\nAlbornoz missed only [[Bologna]] to complete his rebuilding of the Papal States. When that city was attacked by [[Bernab\u00f2 Visconti]] of [[Milan]], its ruler, Giovanni d'Olleggio, decided to hand it over to Albornoz. In the meantime, Innocent died: the Spanish cardinal refused the tiara, and [[Urban V]] was elected. Under him Albornoz started the military campaign against Visconti and, when all attacks failed, Urban proclaimed a crusade against him.\n\nAs Urban's greatest desire was that of a crusade against the Turks, the two parts signed a hasty peace, which was highly favourable to Visconti. The relentless work of Albornoz ushered in a decade of warfare and atrocity culminating in the massacre of Cesena, a town faithful to the Papal cause whose entire population was executed by the Papal forces while paving the way of [[Pope Urban V|Urban V]] to [[Rome]] (1367).{{cn|date=July 2015}}\n\nAs legate, Albornoz showed himself to be an astute manager of men and effective fighter. He began by making use of [[Cola di Rienzo]] (former leader of the citizenship freedom in Rome), whose release from prison at Avignon he secured. After the murder of the tribune in 1354 Albornoz pursued his task of restoring the pope's authority by intrigue and force with remarkable success. However, the ten years of bloody warfare conducted by Albornoz accomplished very little to secure the pacification of Italy for now four mercenary companies roved through Italy spreading further bloodshed and strife. The Papal State was itself far from completely pacified; a savage and devastating war went on from 1361 to 1367 between Rome and Velletri while in 1366-7 there was a general rebellion in Campagna. Despite all and as a mark of gratitude the pope appointed him legate at [[Bologna]] in 1367, but he died at Viterbo the same year. According to his own desire his remains were carried to Toledo, where Henry of Castile had them entombed with almost royal honours.\n\nThe [[Collegio di Spagna|college of Saint Clement]] at Bologna was founded by Albornoz for the benefit Castilian, Aragonese and Portuguese students, in 1364.<ref>[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/a/albornoz.htm&prev=search \"Alvarez Gil Carrillo de Albornoz\", ''Biogra\u1e1fias y Vidas'']</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Papal States]]\n*[[War of the Eight Saints]]\n*[[History of Rome]]\n*[[Cola di Rienzo]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*\"De Vita et Rebus Gestis Aegidii Albornotii\", in Sepulveda's ''Opera Omnia'', vol. iv.

He studied in Venice, where he became acquainted with [[Erasmus]] and [[Aldus Manutius]], and at an early age was reputed one of the most learned men of the time. In 1508 he went to [[Paris]] on the invitation of [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] as professor of ''belles lettres,'' and held for a time the position of [[Rector of the University of Paris]]. He was an early teacher of Greek at the University and edited texts by [[Isocrates]] and [[Plutarch]] printed by [[Gilles de Gourmont]] in 1509/1510.<ref>J. Paquier, ''J\u00e9r\u00f4me Al\u00e9andre'' (1900), p. 67.</ref> Entering the service of [[Erard de la Marck|Eberhard]], [[prince-bishop of Li\u00e8ge]], he was sent by that prelate on a mission to Rome, where [[Pope Leo X]] retained him, giving him (1519) the office of librarian of the Vatican. In the following year he went to [[Germany]] to be present as papal [[nuncio]] at the coronation of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], and was also present at the [[Diet of Worms]], where he headed the opposition to [[Martin Luther]], advocating the most extreme measures to repress the doctrines of the reformer. His conduct evoked the fiercest denunciations of Luther, but it also displeased more moderate men, especially Erasmus. The edict against the reformer, which was finally adopted by the emperor and the diet, was drawn up and proposed by Aleandro.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} After the close of the Diet, the papal nuncio went to the Netherlands, where he instigated the executions of two monks of [[Antwerp]] due to their embrace of the Reformation, resulting in their being burnt in [[Brussels]].\n\nIn August 1524 [[Pope Clement VII]] appointed Aleandro the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brindisi-Ostuni|Archbishop of Brindisi]], for which office he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] two months later.<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/balean.html Catholic Hierarchy ''Girolamo Cardinal Aleandro'']</ref> The pope then sent him as nuncio to the court of King [[Francis I of France]]. He was taken prisoner along with that monarch at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, and was released only on payment of a heavy ransom. He was subsequently employed on various papal missions, especially to Germany, but was unsuccessful in preventing the German princes from making a truce with the reformers, or in checking to any extent the progress of the reformers' doctrines.\n\nAleandro was eventually [[consecration|consecrated]] a bishop on 28 February 1528 to fulfill the duties of his office. He was created a cardinal ''[[in pectore]]'' on 22 December 1536 by [[Pope Paul III]] (at the same time as [[Reginald Pole]]), which was published (i.e., publicly announced) only on 13 March 1538, at which time he was able to assume that office. He was given the rank of [[Cardinal Priest]], with his [[titular church]] in Rome as [[San Ciriaco alle Terme Diocleziane]], which was changed a week later to the Church of [[San Crisogono]].<ref>Catholic Hierarchy</ref>\n\nAleandro resigned as Archbishop of Brindisi on 30 January 1541. He died at [[Rome]] on 1 February 1542.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} His remains were initially buried in his titular church, but later were transferred to his hometown and re-buried there in the Church of San Niccol\u00f2.<ref>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1536.htm The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church \"Consistory of December 22, 1536 (III)\"]</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nAleandro compiled a ''Lexicon Graeco-Latinum'' (1512), and wrote Latin verse of considerable merit inserted in the ''Carmina Illustrium Poetarum Italiorum'' of [[Joannes Matthaeus Toscanus]].

Among the most popular and most common are ''[[Bratwurst]]'', usually made of ground pork and spices, the ''Wiener'' (Viennese), which may be pork or beef and is smoked and fully cooked in a water bath, and ''Blutwurst'' ([[blood sausage]]) or ''Schwarzwurst'' (black sausage) made from blood (often of pigs or geese). Thousands of types of cold cuts also are available. There are many regional specialties, such as the ''[[Weisswurst|M\u00fcnchner Wei\u00dfwurst]]'' (Munich white sausage) popular in [[Bavaria]] or the ''[[Currywurst]]'' (depending on region, either a steamed pork sausage or a version of the ''Bratwurst'', sliced and spiced with curry ketchup) popular in the metropolitan areas of [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]] and the [[Ruhr Area]]. Strict regulations governing what may and may not be put into them have been in force in Germany since the 13th century.

[[German wine]] comes predominantly from the areas along the upper and middle [[Rhine]] and its tributaries. [[Riesling]] and [[Silvaner]] are among the best-known varieties of white wine, while [[Pinot noir|Sp\u00e4tburgunder]] and [[Dornfelder]] are important German red wines. The sweet German wines sold in English-speaking countries seem mostly to cater to the foreign market, as they are rare in Germany.\n\n''[[Korn (liquor)|Korn]]'', a German spirit made from malt (wheat, rye or barley), is consumed predominantly in the middle and northern parts of Germany. ''Obstler'', on the other hand, distilled from apples and pears (''Obstler''), plums, cherries (''[[Kirschwasser]]''), or mirabelle plums, is preferred in the southern parts. The term ''Schnaps'' refers to both kinds of hard liquors.\n\nAll cold drinks in bars and restaurants are sold in glasses with a calibration mark (''Eichstrich'')<ref>[http://www.vg-dudenhofen.de/vg_dudenhofen/daten/Schankgefaesse.pdf Merkblatt \u00fcber Schankgef\u00e4\u00dfe - Eichrechtliche Vorschriften (instruction sheet regarding calibration of drinking vessels) {{de_icon}}]</ref> that is frequently checked by the ''Eichamt'' (~ Bureau of Weights and Measures) to ensure the guest is getting as much as is offered in the menu.\n\n===Non-alcoholic drinks===\n\n[[Coffee]] is also very common,<ref name=\"Tucker 2017 p. 65\">{{cite book | last=Tucker | first=C.M. | title=Coffee Culture: Local Experiences, Global Connections | publisher=Taylor & Francis | series=Routledge Series for Creative Teaching and Learning in Anthropology | year=2017 | isbn=978-1-317-39225-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-i0lDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA65 | access-date=November 30, 2017 | page=65}}</ref> not only for breakfast, but also accompanying a piece of cake (''Kaffee und Kuchen'') in the afternoon, usually on Sundays or special occasions and birthdays.

Water provided by the [[water supply|public water utilities]] can be had without hesitation directly from the tap. Usually, no chlorine is added. Drinking water is controlled by state authority to ensure it is potable. Regulations are even stricter than those for bottled water (see [[:de: Trinkwasserverordnung|Trinkwasserverordnung]]).\n\n==Regional cuisine==\n{{See also|List of German dishes}}\n\nGerman regional cuisine can be divided into many varieties such as [[Bavarian cuisine]] (southern Germany) or [[Thuringia]]n (central Germany) and [[Lower Saxon cuisine]].<ref>[http://www.food-links.com/countries/germany/german-regional-food-specialties.php \"German Regional Food Specialties.\"] [http://www.food-links.com Food-links.com]. Accessed July 2011.</ref>\n\n===Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg===\n{{Main article|Baden cuisine|Swabian cuisine}}\n[[Image:Badische Maultaschen.jpg|thumb|Badische [[Maultaschen]]]]\n\nDue to the physiogeographically situation, the [[Upper Rhine Plain]] with Germany's warmest [[climate]], fruitful [[volcanic soil]]s, already in the [[Roman period]] used medicinal springs and spas with very good infrastructural features, the proximity to [[France]] and [[Switzerland]] Baden had better prerequisites to develop a high quality [[gastronomy]] than [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] or [[Bavaria]]. Special plant crops such as [[tobacco]], [[wine]], [[fruit]] and [[horticulture]] are of supranational importance and offer the inhabitants and visitors a diverse and wide selection of local products. [[Asparagus]] and [[chestnut]]s are as skillfully used in the kitchen as [[tripe]] and [[escargot]] and a variety of fruity [[dessert]]s and [[pastry|pastries]] is provided for the traditional German \"Kaffee und Kuchen\" (lit. \"coffee and cake\", similar to the British [[tea time]]). Nationwide this region features the highest density of star-rated [[restaurant]]s, similar to the neighbouring region [[Alsace]] which does the same for [[France]].\n\n===Bavaria===\n{{Main article|Bavarian cuisine}}\n[[Image:Schweizerhaus04.jpg|thumb|Roasted ''[[Schweinshaxe]]'']]\n\nThe Bavarian dukes, especially the [[Wittelsbach]] family, developed Bavarian cuisine and refined it to be presentable to the royal court. This cuisine has belonged to wealthy households, especially in cities, since the 19th century. The (old) Bavarian cuisine is closely connected to [[Czech cuisine]] and [[Austrian cuisine]] (especially from [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [[Salzburg]]), mainly through the Wittelsbach and [[Habsburg]] families. Already in the beginning, Bavarians were closely connected to their neighbours in Austria through linguistic, cultural and political similarities, which also reflected on the cuisine.\n\nA characteristic Bavarian cuisine was further developed by both groups, with a distinct similarity to [[Franconia]]n and [[Swabia]]n cuisine. A Bavarian speciality is the [[Brotzeit]], a savoury snack, which would originally be eaten between breakfast and lunch.\n\nBavaria is a part of Southeastern Germany, including the city of Munich and spreading to board with the countries Austria and the Czech Republic. The region is located at higher elevations, and is known for yielding beet and potato crops and also for the production of fine beers.\n\n===Hamburg===\n{{Main article|Cuisine of Hamburg|Pomeranian cuisine|Lower Saxon cuisine}}\n[[Image:Krabbentoast mit Dill Hamburger Snack (retuschiert).jpg|thumb|A snack typical for Hamburg: brown shrimps on roasted toast bread garnished with dill]]\n\nDue to its century-old history as a harbour town, the traditional cuisine of [[Hamburg]] is very diversified and sapid as ingredients\u2019 supply was safe. Until the 20th century, it was predominantly characterized by the extensive choice of different kinds of [[fish]] from the river [[Elbe]] and the quick access to both the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]], both being roughly 100 kilometers away from the city center. The neighboring regions did supply the city state with fresh [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]] came mainly from a region called [[Altes Land]] just southwest of Hamburg and until [[industrialization]], the neighbourhood of [[Wilhelmsburg, Hamburg|Wilhelmsburg]] was considered the \u2018milk isle\u2019 of Hamburg.\n\nInternational trade made [[spice]]s and exotic nutrition items from [[Asia]] and [[South America]] available since the 16th century which were soon incorporated into civic kitchens. On this basis, the cuisine of Hamburg developed its characteristics nowadays due to the supraregional harmonization of the Northern German and Scandinavian cuisine. Due to its high economic importance, Hamburg does feature many internationally recognized gourmet restaurants: 11 of them were awarded with a [[Michelin star]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.hamburg-magazin.de/gastl_bewertung.htm ''Hamburg wieder die Hochburg der Sternek\u00f6che''.] Retrieved, 12 February 2010)</ref>\n\n===Hesse===\n{{Main article|Hessian cuisine}}\n\n===Palatinate/Pfalz===\n{{Main article| Palatine cuisine}}\n\n===Thuringia===\n[[File:Th\u00fcringer Rostbr\u00e4tel.JPG|thumb|Thuringian marinated cutlet of pork (Rostbr\u00e4tel) with pan fried potatoes]]\n\n[[Wheat]], [[grapeseed]], [[sugarbeet]]s, and [[barley]] grow well, along with a variety of vegetables, which grow near [[Erfurt]], the state's capital.

[[Tomato]]es, [[lettuce]], [[broad bean]]s, [[onion]]s, and [[cucumber]]s are grown in the eastern portion of the region near [[Jena]] under glass centers on about {{convert|12|acre|m2}} of land.  Thuringia is the second-largest [[herb]]-growing region in Germany; the town of [[K\u00f6lleda]] was once considered the \"[[peppermint]] town\", where herb growers used to congregate to study herb cultivation.<ref>Metzger, 13,19.</ref>\n\nOne-third of Thuringia is covered in forest, and is considered to be one of the best game-hunting regions in Germany.

[[Pheasant]] and [[capercaillie]] are protected game species that may not be hunted.  The wooded areas also contain a wide variety of [[edible mushroom]]s, such as chestnut mushrooms, [[porcini]], and chanterelles, along with wild berries, such as [[Blueberry|blueberries]], [[cranberry|cranberries]], [[Raspberry|raspberries]], and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], which are all traditional accompaniments to game dishes.<ref>Metzger, 20.</ref>\n\nThe most famous foods from Thuringia are [[Thuringian sausage]]s and [[:de:Th\u00fcringer Kl\u00f6\u00dfe|Thuringian dumpling]]s. The state is also known for its [[sausage]]s; steamed, scaled, and cured varieties are all prepared.  Popular varieties include Th\u00fcringer ''[[Mettwurst]]'' (a spreadable cured sausage), ''[[:de:Eichsfelder Feldgieker|Feldkieker]]'' (a cured, air-dried sausage dried up to eight months), Th\u00fcringer ''[[Leberwurst]]'' (a steamed pork and liver sausage), Th\u00fcringer ''[[Rotwurst]]'' (a steamed blood sausage packed in a bladder or other natural casing)<ref>Metzger, 22-25.</ref> and ''[[Mett]]'' (minced pork).\n\n===Saxony===\n{{Main article|Saxon cuisine|Ore Mountain cuisine}}\n[[File:S\u00e4chsische Kartoffelsuppe, Alte Apotheke, Altk\u00f6tzschenbroda.jpg|right|thumb|S\u00e4chsische Kartoffelsuppe (potato soup)]]\n\nIn general the cuisine is very hearty and features many peculiarities of central Germany such as a great variety of [[sauce]]s which accompany the [[main dish]] and the fashion to serve ''Kl\u00f6\u00dfe\"'' or [[Kn\u00f6del]] as a [[side dish]] instead of [[potato]]es, [[pasta]] or [[rice]]. Also much [[freshwater fish]] is used in Saxon cuisine, particularly [[carp]] and [[trout]] as is the case throughout [[Eastern Europe]].\n\nThe rich history of the region did and still does influence the cuisine. In the blossoming and growing cities of [[Dresden]] and [[Leipzig]] an extravagant style of cuisine is cherished (one may only think of the [[crab]] as an ingredient in the famous [[Leipziger Allerlei]]). Other regions where the people had to work really hard to yield some harvest and were really poor like in the [[Erzgebirge]] peasant dishes play a major role and famous dishes originating there are e.g. [[potato]]es with [[Quark (dairy product)|Quark]], potato soup or potato with [[bread]] and [[linseed oil]]. Also in the region [[Vogtland]] there were many peasants but they were wealthier and that's why in this region the [[Sunday roast]] is a tradition that is nowadays still lived up to.\n\n[[Cereal grain]] cultivation occupies 62% of the cultivated land in [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. [[Wheat]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, and [[rye]] are grown, with the rye being grown near [[Borde]], where it is used to make ''[[Crisp bread|Burger Kn\u00e4ckebrot]]'', a flatbread produced there since 1931. Another 10% of the cultivated area is planted in [[sugar beet]]s for conversion to sugar, popularized after the 19th century, when the region had an economic boom.<ref>Metzger, 49.</ref>\n\n==International influences==\n[[File:Doener berlin kraeuter.jpg|thumb|The German D\u00f6ner Kebap]]\n\nThe first wave of foreigners coming to Germany specifically to sell their food specialties were ice cream makers from northern Italy, who started to arrive in noticeable numbers during the late 1920s.

Important vegetables include [[tomato]], [[eggplant|aubergine]] (eggplant), [[potato]], [[green bean]]s, [[okra]], [[Capsicum|green peppers]], and [[onion]]s. [[Honey]] in Greece is mainly honey from the nectar of fruit trees and citrus trees: lemon, orange, [[bigarade]] (bitter orange) trees, thyme honey, and pine honey. ''[[Mastic (plant resin)|Mastic]]'' (aromatic, ivory-coloured resin) is grown on the Aegean island of [[Chios]].\n\nGreek cuisine uses some flavorings more often than other [[Mediterranean cuisine]]s do, namely [[oregano]], [[mentha|mint]], [[garlic]], [[onion]], [[dill]] and [[bay laurel]] leaves. Other common herbs and spices include [[basil]], [[thyme]] and [[fennel]] seed. Parsley is also used as a garnish on some dishes. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use \"sweet\" spices in combination with meat, for example [[cinnamon]], whole spice and [[clove]]s in stews.\n\nThe climate and terrain has tended to favour the breeding of [[goat]]s and [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] over [[cattle]], and thus [[beef]] dishes are uncommon. [[Fish (food)|Fish]] dishes are common in coastal regions and on the islands. A great variety of [[List of cheeses|cheese types]] are used in Greek cuisine, including ''[[Feta]]'', ''[[Kasseri]]'', ''[[Kefalotyri]]'', ''[[Graviera]]'', ''[[Anthotyros]]'', ''[[Manouri]]'', ''[[Metsovone]]'', Ladotyri (cheese with olive oil), Kalathaki (a specialty from the island of Limnos), Katiki-Tsalafouti (both creamy cheeses, suitable for spreads) and ''[[Mizithra]]''.\n\nToo much refinement is generally considered to be against the hearty spirit of the Greek cuisine, though recent trends among Greek culinary circles tend to favour a somewhat more refined approach.\n\nDining out is common in Greece, and has been for quite some time. The ''[[Taverna]]'' and ''Estiatorio'' are widespread, serving home cooking at affordable prices to both locals and tourists. Recently, fast food has become more widespread, with local chains such as [[Goody's (restaurant)|Goody's]] springing up, though most McDonald's have closed.<ref>{{cite web|author=\u03a4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u03a4\u03c3\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03c1\u03b7 |url=http://www.tovima.gr/finance/article/?aid=402882 |title=\u0397 Goody's \u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7 McDonald\u2019s - \u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 - \u03a4\u03bf \u0392\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1 Online |publisher=Tovima.gr |date= |accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> Locals still largely eat Greek cuisine.<ref>{{cite web |title=When And How Greeks Eat |url=http://www.ultimate-guide-to-greek-food.com/how-greeks-eat.html |website=Ultimate Guide to Greek Food |accessdate=11 June 2016}}</ref> In addition, some traditional Greek foods, especially [[souvlaki]], [[gyro (food)|gyros]], [[pita]] such as [[tyropita]] and [[spanakopita]] (respectively, cheese and spinach pie) are often served in fast food style.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Kalamataolives.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Kalamata olive]]s]]\n[[File:Thymus vulgaris.jpg|thumb|[[Thyme]], one of the most traditional Greek herbs, was mentioned in the [[Odyssey]].]]\n\nGreece has an ancient culinary tradition dating back several millennia, and over the centuries Greek cuisine has evolved and absorbed numerous influences and influenced many cuisines itself.\n\nSome dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece: [[lentil]] [[soup]], [[fasolada]], [[retsina]] (white or ros\u00e9 wine flavored with pine resin) and [[pasteli]] (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey); some to the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] periods: [[loukaniko]] (dried pork sausage); and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]: [[feta]] cheese, [[boutargue|avgotaraho]] (cured fish roe) and [[paximadi]] (traditional hard bread baked from wheat, barley and rye). There are also many ancient and Byzantine dishes which are no longer consumed: [[porridge]] as the main staple, [[garum|fish sauce]], and salt water mixed into wine.\n\nMany dishes entered Greek cuisine from [[Ottoman cuisine]]: [[moussaka]], [[tzatziki]], [[yuvarlak]]ia, [[kofta|keftethes]], [[burek|boureki]], and so on.\n\n==Regions==\n{{double image|right|Koukouvagia.jpg|130|Tsigaridia.JPG|150|Regional cuisine: \"[[Dakos]]\", traditional Cretan salad (left) and \"Tsigaridia\", traditional Cephalonian dish (right)}}\n\nDistinct from the mainstream regional cuisines are:\n* Cuisine of the Aegean islands (including ''Kykladitiki'', from [[Kyklades]])\n* Arcadian cuisine\n* [[Cuisine of the Ionian islands]]\n* ''Ipirotiki'' (Epirotic cuisine)\n* ''Kritiki'' ([[Cretan cuisine]])\n* ''Kypriaki'' ([[Cypriot cuisine]])\n* ''Makedoniki'' ([[Macedonian cuisine (Greek)|Macedonian cuisine]])\n* ''[[Minor Asia cuisine|Mikrasiatiki]]'', from the Greek refugees of Asia Minor, including ''[[Politiki cuisine|Politiki]]'', from the tradition of the Greeks of Constantinople\n* ''[[Pontic cuisine|Pontiaki]]'', found anywhere there are [[Pontic Greeks|Pontians]] (Greek immigrants from the Black Sea region)\n\n==Typical dishes==\nGreek cuisine is very diverse and although there are many common characteristics amongst the culinary traditions of different regions within the country, there are also many differences, making it difficult to present a full list of representative dishes. For example, the vegetarian dish \"Chaniotiko Boureki\" (oven baked slices of potatoes with zucchini, myzithra cheese and mint) is a typical dish in western [[Crete]], in the region of [[Chania]]. A family in [[Chania]] may consume this dish 1-2 times per week in the summer season. However, it is not cooked in any other region of Greece.\nMany food items are wrapped in Filo pastry, either in bite-size triangles or in large sheets: kotopita (chicken pie), spanakotyropita ([[spinach]] and cheese pie), chortopita ([[Leaf vegetable|greens]] pie), kreatopita (meat pie, using minced meat), kolokythopita (zucchini pie) ''etc.'' The Greeks do with filo what the Italians do with pizza; They have countless variations of pitas (savory pies). Even the word pita was originally spelled \u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1 (pitta), which shows a similarity to pizza.\nThe areas with the largest tradition of making Greek pitas are the North-Western (Hepirus) and Central Greece (also called Roumeli).\nAlso, a big part of the Greek Cuisine are seeds and nuts. Seeds and nuts are included in everything from pastry to main dishes.<ref>Vasilopoulou, E., Dilis, V., & Trichopoulou, A. (2013).

A ''tav\u00e9rna'' (tavern) or ''estiat\u00f3rio'' (restaurant) also offers a meze as an ''orektik\u00f3'' (appetiser). Many restaurants offer their house ''pikil\u00eda'' (variety) a platter with a [[smorgasbord]] of various mezedes that can be served immediately to customers looking for a quick or light meal. Hosts commonly serve mezedes to their guests at informal or impromptu get-togethers as they are easy to prepare on short notice.

They were made with fresh strained orange juice or lemon juice either mixed with carbonated water or flat mineral water and you added sugar to taste. There were also bottled local versions. In 1989 on the island of Rhodes there were two companies that made and bottled their own portokalada and lemonada using local oranges, lemons and water. These beverages are still standards today, as of 2014, the difference being that most of the small local companies sold their businesses to the big companies like Fanta etc., thus, greatly changing the quality.\n\nVisinada (cherryade) is made from dark cherry syrup (which was originally homemade) mixed with cold water.\n\n====Coffee====\n[[File:Frappe (4547117210).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frapp\u00e9 coffee]]]]\n\nThe traditional coffeehouses in Greece are called ''[[kafenio|kafenia]]'', and they offer coffee, refreshments, alcoholic beverages and snacks or meze.

[[canonical gospels]] and one of the three [[synoptic gospels]]. It tells of the [[ministry of Jesus]] from his [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]] by [[John the Baptist]] to his death and burial and the discovery of the [[empty tomb]]&nbsp;\u2013 there is no [[genealogy of Jesus]] or birth narrative, nor, in the original ending at [[Mark 16|chapter 16]], any [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|post-resurrection appearances]]. It portrays Jesus as a heroic man of action, an [[Exorcism|exorcist]], a healer, and a miracle worker. Jesus is also the [[Son of God]], but he keeps his [[Messianic Secret|identity secret]] (the Messianic Secret), concealing it in [[parables]] so that even the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] fail to understand. All this is in keeping with prophecy, which foretold the fate of the [[messiah]] as [[suffering servant]].{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=252\u201353}} The gospel ends, in its original version, with the discovery of the empty tomb, a promise to meet again in Galilee, and an unheeded instruction to spread the good news of the [[resurrection of Christ|resurrection]].{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=1\u20133}}\n\nMark probably dates from 66\u201370 AD.{{sfn|Perkins|1998|p=241}} It appears as the second New Testament gospel because it was traditionally thought to be an [[epitome]] (summary) of [[gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], but most scholars now regard it as the earliest written [[gospel]].{{sfn|Perkins|2009|p=16}}{{sfn|Beaver|2009|p=189}} Some also reject the [[tradition]] which ascribes it to [[John Mark]], the companion of the apostle [[Apostle Peter|Peter]], and regard it as the work of an unknown author working with various sources including collections of miracle stories, controversy stories, parables, and a passion narrative.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=156}}\n\n==Composition and setting==\n[[File:Andrea Mantegna 087.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]]]]\n\n===Composition===\n[[File:Synoptic problem, two-source hypothesis.svg|thumb|The two-source hypothesis: Most scholars agree that Mark was the first of the gospels to be composed, and that the authors of Matthew and Luke used it plus a second document called the [[Q source]] when composing their own gospels. The blue sections indicate material original to Luke and Matthew.]]\n\nThe Gospel of Mark is anonymous.{{sfn|Sanders|1995|pp=63\u201364}} Early tradition commencing with [[Papias of Hierapolis]] links it to [[John Mark]], a companion and interpreter of the [[apostle Peter]], and hence its author is often called [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], but most scholars are content to identify the author of Mark's gospel as an unknown first-century Christian.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=36}} It was probably written c. AD 66\u201370, during [[Nero]]'s persecution of the Christians in Rome or the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Jewish revolt]], as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution.{{sfn|Perkins|1998|p=241}} The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as conflict stories (Mark 2:1\u20133:6), [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] discourse (4:1\u201335), and collections of sayings (although not the [[Gospel of Thomas]] and probably not the [[Q source]]).{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nMark was written in Greek, for a gentile audience (that they were gentiles is shown by the author's need to explain Jewish traditions and translate Aramaic terms) of Greek-speaking Christians: Rome (Mark uses a number of Latin terms), Galilee, Antioch (third-largest city in the Roman Empire, located in northern Syria), and southern Syria have all been offered as alternative places of authorship.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=157}} The author may have been influenced by Greco-Roman biographies and rhetorical forms, popular novels and romances, and the Homeric epics; nevertheless, he mentions almost no public figures, makes no allusions to Greek or Roman literature, and takes all his references from the Jewish scriptures, mostly in their Greek versions from the [[Septuagint]].{{sfn|Donahue|2005|pp=15\u201316}} His book is not history in the modern sense, or even in the sense of classical Greek and Roman historians, but \"history in an [[eschatology|eschatological]] or [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] sense,\" depicting Jesus caught up in events at the end of time.{{sfn|Donahue|2005|p=15}}\n\n===Synoptic problem and historicity===\n[[Image:MarkEvangelist.jpg|thumb|right|Mark the Evangelist, 16th-century Russian icon]]\nThe gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke bear a striking resemblance to each other, so much so that their contents can easily be set [[Gospel harmony#A parallel harmony presentation|side by side in parallel columns]]. The fact that they share so much material verbatim and yet also exhibit important differences has led to a number of hypotheses explaining their interdependence, a phenomenon termed the [[Synoptic  Problem]]. Traditionally, Mark was thought to be an [[epitome]] (summary) of Matthew: for example, [[Augustine of Hippo]] believed they were written in order, \"first Matthew, then Mark, thirdly [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], lastly [[Gospel of John|John]]\" and that Mark followed Matthew as \"his attendant and epitomizer\".<ref>Augustine of Hippo, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1602102.htm Harmony of the Gospels], Book 1, Chapter 2</ref> Today, the most widely accepted hypothesis is that [[Marcan priority|Mark was the first gospel]] (Marcan Priority) and was used as a source by both Matthew and Luke, together with considerable additional material. The strongest argument for this is the fact that Matthew and Luke agree with each other in their sequence of stories and events only when they also agree with Mark.{{sfn|Koester|2000|pp=44\u201346}}\n\nThe 19th century recognition of Mark as the earliest gospel led to the belief that it must therefore be the most reliable.{{sfn|Williamson|1983|p=17}} This conclusion was shaken by two works published in the early decades of the 20th century: in 1901 [[William Wrede]] argued strongly that the \"Messianic secret\" motif in Mark was a creation of the early church rather than a reflection of the historical Jesus; and in 1919 Karl Ludwig Schmidt showed how the links between the episodes are the invention of the writer, thus undermining the claim that the gospel is a reliable guide to the chronology of Jesus' mission.{{sfn|Joel|2000|p=859}} The modern consensus is that Mark's purpose was to present a theological message rather than to write history,{{sfn|Williamson|1983|p=17}} but this gospel is nevertheless still seen as the most reliable of the four in terms of its overall description of Jesus's life and ministry.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=37}}\n\n===Setting===\nChristianity began within [[Judaism]], with a Christian \"church\" (or \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1, ''ekklesia'', meaning \"assembly\") that arose shortly after his death, when some of his followers claimed to have witnessed him risen from the dead.{{sfn|L\u00f6ssl|2010|p=43}} From the outset, Christians depended heavily on [[Jewish literature]], supporting their convictions through the Jewish scriptures.{{sfn|Gamble|1995|p=23}} Those convictions involved a nucleus of key concepts: the messiah, the [[son of God]] and the [[son of man]], the [[Day of the Lord]], the [[kingdom of God]]. Uniting these ideas was the common thread of apocalyptic expectation: Both Jews and Christians believed that the end of history was at hand, that God would very soon come to punish their enemies and establish his own rule, and that they were at the centre of his plans. Christians read the Jewish scripture as a figure or type of Jesus Christ, so that the goal of Christian literature became an experience of the living Christ.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=6}} The new movement spread around the eastern Mediterranean and to Rome and further west, and assumed a distinct identity, although the groups within it remained extremely diverse.{{sfn|L\u00f6ssl|2010|p=43}}\n\nThe gospels were written for an audience already Christian&nbsp;\u2013 their purpose was to strengthen the faith of those who already believed, not to convert unbelievers.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=59}} Christian \"churches\" were small communities of believers, often based on households (an autocratic patriarch plus extended family, slaves, freedmen, and other clients), and the evangelists often wrote on two levels, one the \"historical\" presentation of the story of Jesus, the other dealing with the concerns of the author's own day.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=60}} Thus the proclamation of Jesus in Mark 1:14 and the following verses, for example, mixes the terms Jesus would have used as a 1st-century Jew (\"kingdom of God\") and those of the early church (\"believe\", \"gospel\").{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=60}} More fundamentally, some scholars believe Mark's reason for writing was to counter believers who saw Jesus in a Greek way, as wonder-worker (the Greek term is \"divine man\"); Mark saw the suffering of the messiah as essential, so that the \"Son of God\" title (the Hellenistic \"divine man\") had to be corrected and amplified with the \"Son of Man\" title, which conveyed [[passion of Jesus|Christ's suffering]].{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=61}} Other scholars think Mark might have been writing as a Galilean Christian against those Jewish Christians in Jerusalem who saw the Jewish revolt against Rome (66\u201373 CE) as the beginning of the \"[[end time]]s\": for Mark, the Second Coming would be in Galilee, not Jerusalem, and not until the generation following the revolt.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=61}}\n\n===Place in the Christian Church===\nMark was traditionally placed second, and sometimes fourth, in the Christian canon, as a somewhat inferior abridgement of what was regarded as the most important gospel, [[gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]. The Church has consequently derived its view of Jesus primarily from Matthew, secondarily from [[gospel of John|John]], and only distantly from Mark. It was only in the 19th century that Mark came to be seen as the earliest of the four gospels, and as a source used by both Matthew and [[gospel of Luke|Luke]]. The hypothesis of [[Markan priority]] (that Mark was written first) continues to be held by the majority of scholars today, and there is a new recognition of the author as an artist and theologian using a range of literary devices to convey his conception of Jesus as the authoritative yet suffering [[Son of God]].{{sfn|Edwards|2002|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n==Structure, style and content==\n{{Content of Mark}}\n[[File:Mark Bib Lat 1486 c.2 Bodleian Library.jpg|thumbnail|left|Page from Mark in a Latin bible dated 1486 (Bodleian Library)]]\n\n===Structure===\nThere is no agreement on the structure of Mark.{{sfn|Twelftree|1999|p=68}} There is, however, a widely recognised break at Mark 8:26\u201331: before 8:26 there are numerous miracle stories, the action is in Galilee, and Jesus preaches to the crowds, while after 8:31 there are hardly any miracles, the action shifts from Galilee to gentile areas or hostile Judea, and Jesus teaches the disciples.{{sfn|Cole|1989|p=86}} Peter's confession at Mark 8:27\u201330 that Jesus is the messiah thus forms the watershed to the whole gospel.{{sfn|Cole|1989|pp=86\u201387}} A further generally recognised turning point comes at the end of chapter 10, when Jesus and his followers arrive in Jerusalem and the foreseen confrontation with the Temple authorities begins, leading [[R.T. France]] to characterise Mark as a three-act drama.{{sfn|France|2002|p=11}} James Edwards in his 2002 commentary points out that the gospel can be seen as a series of questions asking first who Jesus is (the answer being that he is the messiah), then what form his mission takes (a mission of suffering culminating in the crucifixion and resurrection, events only to be understood when the questions are answered), while another scholar, C. Myers, has made what Edwards calls a \"compelling case\" for recognising the incidents of Jesus' baptism, [[transfiguration of Christ|transfiguration]] and crucifixion, at the beginning, middle and end of the gospel, as three key moments, each with common elements, and each portrayed in an apocalyptic light.{{sfn|Edwards|2002|pp=38\u201339}} Stephen H.

He also has several run-ins with Jewish law keepers especially in chapters 2-3.\n* Jesus asks the disciples who people say he is, and then, \"but you, who do you say I am?\" Peter answers that he is the Christ, and Jesus commands him to silence; Jesus explains that the Son of Man must go to Jerusalem and be killed, but will rise again; [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]] appear with Jesus and God tells the disciples, \"This is my son,\" but they remain uncomprehending.\n* Jesus goes to Jerusalem, where he is hailed as one who \"comes in the name of the Lord\" and will inaugurate the \"kingdom of David\"; he drives those who buy and sell animals from the Temple and debates with the Jewish authorities; on the Mount of Olives he announces the coming destruction of the Temple, the persecution of his followers, and the coming of the [[Son of Man]] in power and glory.\n* A woman perfumes Jesus' head with oil, and Jesus explains that this is a sign of his coming death; Jesus celebrates [[Passover]] with the disciples, declares the bread and wine to be his body and blood, and goes with them to [[Gethsemane]] to pray; there [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] betrays him to the Jews; interrogated by the high priest, he says that he is the Christ, the Son of God, and will return as Son of Man at God's right hand; the Jewish leaders turn him over to [[Pilate]], who has him crucified as one who claims to be \"king of the Jews\"; Jesus, abandoned by the disciples, is buried in a rock tomb by a friendly member of the Jewish council.\n* The women who have followed Jesus come to the tomb on Sunday morning; they find it empty, and are told by a young man in a white robe to go and tell the others that Jesus has risen and has gone before them to Galilee; \"but they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid&nbsp;....\"{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n===Ending===\n{{Details|Mark 16}}\nThe earliest and most reliable manuscripts of Mark end at Mark 16:8, with the women fleeing in fear from the empty tomb: the majority of recent scholars believe this to be the original ending,{{sfn|Edwards|2002|pp=500\u201301}} and this is supported by statements from the early Church Fathers Eusebius and Jerome.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6ter|2010|p=279}} Two attempts were made to provide a more satisfactory conclusion.{{sfn|Horsely|2007|p=91}} A minority of later manuscripts have what is called the \"shorter ending\", an addition to Mark 16:8 telling how the women told \"those around Peter\" all that the angel had commanded and how the message of eternal life (or \"proclamation of eternal salvation\") was then sent out by Jesus himself.{{sfn|Horsely|2007|p=91}} This addition differs from the rest of Mark both in style and in its understanding of Jesus.{{sfn|Horsely|2007|p=91}} The overwhelming majority of manuscripts have the \"longer ending\", Mark 16:9\u201320, with accounts of the resurrected Jesus, the commissioning of the disciples to proclaim the gospel, and Christ's ascension.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6ter|2010|p=279}} This ending was possibly written in the early 2nd century and added later in the same century.{{sfn|Horsely|2007|p=91}}\n\nModern scholars have proposed many explanations for the abrupt original ending, though none with universal acceptance. It could indicate a connection to the theme of the \"[[Messianic Secret]]\". Whatever the case, it is clear that Mark's Jesus looks forward to a post-death meeting in Galilee, and it is likely that at that meeting, like the final meeting in Galilee that Matthew depicts, Mark's Jesus would command the disciples to take his message to the nations.{{sfn|Edwards|2002|p=500}}\n\n==Theology==\n[[File:Sargis Pitsak.jpg|thumb|left|First page of the Gospel of Mark: \"''The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God''\", by [[Sargis Pitsak]] (14th century)]]\n[[File:Archaic mark session.jpg|thumb|[[Minuscule 2427]]&nbsp;\u2013 \"Archaic Mark\"]]\n\n===Mark's gospel theology===\nThe author introduces his work as \"gospel\", meaning \"good news\", a literal translation of the Greek \"evangelion\"{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=17}}&nbsp;\u2013 he uses the word more often than any other writer in the New Testament besides Paul.{{sfn|Morris|1990|p=95}} Paul uses it to mean \"the good news (of the saving significance of the death and resurrection) of Christ\"; Mark extends it to the career of Christ as well as his death and resurrection.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=17}} Like the other gospels, Mark was written to confirm the identity of Jesus as [[eschatology|eschatological deliverer]]&nbsp;\u2013 the purpose of terms such as \"[[messiah]]\" and \"[[son of God]]\".{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=55}} As in all the gospels, the messianic identity of Jesus is supported by a number of themes, including: (1) the depiction of his disciples as obtuse, fearful and uncomprehending; (2) the refutation of the charge made by Jesus' enemies that he was a magician; (3) secrecy surrounding his true identity (this last is missing from John).{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=55}}\n\n====The failure of the disciples====\nIn Mark, the disciples, and especially the Twelve, move from lack of perception of Jesus to rejection of the \"way of suffering\" to flight and denial&nbsp;\u2013 even the women who received the first proclamation of his resurrection can be seen as failures for not reporting the good news. There is much discussion of this theme among scholars. Some argue that the author of Mark was using the disciples to correct \"erroneous\" views in his own community concerning the reality of the suffering messiah, others that it is an attack on the Jerusalem branch of the church for resisting the extension of the gospel to the gentiles, or a mirror of the convert's usual experience of the initial enthusiasm followed by growing awareness of the necessity for suffering. It certainly reflects the strong theme in Mark of Jesus as the \"suffering just one\" portrayed in so many of the books of the Jewish scriptures, from Jeremiah to Job and the Psalms, but especially in the \"[[Suffering Servant]]\" passages in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]]. It also reflects the Jewish scripture theme of God's love being met by infidelity and failure, only to be renewed by God. And in the real-world context in which the gospel was written, the persecutions of the Christians of Rome under Nero, the failure of the disciples and Jesus' denial by Peter himself would have been powerful symbols of faith, hope and reconciliation.{{sfn|Donahue|2005|pp=33\u201334}}\n\n====The charge of magic====\nMark contains twenty accounts of miracles and healings, accounting for almost a third of the gospel and half the first ten chapters, more, proportionally, than in any other gospel.{{sfn|Twelftree|1999|p=57}} In the gospels as a whole, Jesus' miracles, prophecies, etc., are presented as evidence of God's rule, but Mark's descriptions of Jesus' healings are a partial exception to this, as his methods, using spittle to heal blindness (Mark 8:22\u201326) and magic formulae (\"Talitha cumi,\" 5:41, \"Ephphatha,\" 7:34), were those of a magician.{{sfn|Kee|1993|p=483}}{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=57}} This is the charge the Jewish religious leaders bring against Jesus: they say he is performing exorcisms with the aid of an evil spirit (Mark 3:22) and calling up the spirit of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14).{{sfn|Kee|1993|p=483}} \"There was&nbsp;... no period in the history of the [Roman] empire in which the magician was not considered an enemy of society,\" subject to penalties ranging from exile to death, says Classical scholar Ramsay MacMullen.{{sfn|Welch|2006|p=362}} All the gospels defend Jesus against the charge, which, if true, would contradict their ultimate claims for him.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=56}} The point of the [[Beelzebub]] incident in Mark (Mark 3:20\u201330) is to set forth Jesus' claims to be an instrument of God, not Satan.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=56}}\n\n====The messianic secret====\n{{main|Messianic secret}}\nIn 1901, [[William Wrede]] identified the \"Messianic secret\"&nbsp;\u2013 Jesus' secrecy about his identity as the messiah&nbsp;\u2013 as one of Mark's central themes. Wrede argued that the elements of the secret&nbsp;\u2013 Jesus' silencing of the demons, the obtuseness of the disciples regarding his identity, and the concealment of the truth inside parables, were fictions, and arose from the tension between the Church's post-resurrection messianic belief and the historical reality of Jesus. There remains continuing debate over how far the \"secret\" originated with Mark and how far he got it from tradition, and how far, if at all, it represents the self-understanding and practices of the historical Jesus.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=1083}}\n\n===Christology: Mark's understanding of Jesus===\n{{see also|Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament}}\n[[Christology]] means a doctrine or understanding concerning the person or nature of Christ.{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=3}} In the New Testament writings it is frequently conveyed through the titles applied to Jesus. Most scholars agree that \"Son of God\" is the most important of these titles in Mark.{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u20139}} It appears on the lips of God himself at the [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]] and the [[transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], and is Jesus' own self-designation (Mark 13:32).{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}} These and other instances provide reliable evidence of how the evangelist perceived Jesus, but it is not clear just what the title meant to Mark and his 1st century audience.{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}} Where it appears in the Hebrew scriptures it meant Israel as God's people, or the king at his coronation, or angels, as well as the suffering righteous man.{{sfn|Donahue|2005|p=25}} In Hellenistic culture the same phrase meant a \"divine man\", a supernatural being.{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}} There is little evidence that \"son of God\" was a title for the messiah in 1st century Judaism, and the attributes which Mark describes in Jesus are much more those of the Hellenistic miracle-working \"divine man\" than of the Jewish Davidic messiah.{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}}\n\nMark does not explicitly state what he means by \"Son of God\", nor when the sonship was conferred.{{sfn|Ehrman|1993|p=74}} The New Testament as a whole presents four different understandings:\n# Jesus became God's son at his resurrection, God \"begetting\" Jesus to a new life by raising him from the dead&nbsp;\u2013 this was the earliest understanding, preserved in Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]], 1:3\u20134, and in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 13:33;\n# Jesus became God's son at his [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]], the coming of the [[Holy Spirit]] marking him as messiah, while \"Son of God\" refers to the relationship then established for him by God&nbsp;\u2013 this is the understanding implied in Mark 1:9\u201311;\n# Matthew and Luke present Jesus as \"Son of God\" from the moment of conception and birth, with God taking the place of a human father;\n# John, the last of the gospels, presents the idea that the Christ was pre-existent and became flesh as Jesus&nbsp;\u2013 an idea also found in Paul.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nMark also calls Jesus \"christos\" (Christ), translating the Hebrew \"messiah,\" (anointed person).{{sfn|Donahue|2005|pp=25\u201326}} In the Old Testament the term messiah (\"anointed one\") described prophets, priests and kings; by the time of Jesus, with the kingdom long vanished, it had come to mean an [[eschatology|eschatological king]] (a king who would come at the end of time), one who would be entirely human though far greater than all God's previous messengers to Israel, endowed with miraculous powers, free from sin, ruling in justice and glory (as described in, for example, the [[Psalms of Solomon]], a Jewish work from this period).{{sfn|Edwards|2002|p=250}} The most important occurrences are in the context of Jesus' death and suffering, suggesting that, for Mark, Jesus can only be fully understood in that context.{{sfn|Donahue|2005|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nA third important title, \"[[Son of Man]]\", has its roots in [[book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], the [[Book of Enoch]], (a popular Jewish apocalyptic work of the period), and especially in [[Daniel 7]]:13\u201314, where the Son of Man is assigned royal roles of dominion, kingship and glory.{{sfn|Witherington|2001|p=51}}{{sfn|Donahue|2005|pp=26\u201327}} Mark 14:62 combines more scriptural allusions: before he comes on clouds (Daniel 7:13) the Son of Man will be seated on the right hand of God (Psalm 110:1), pointing to the equivalence of the three titles, Christ, Son of God, Son of Man, the common element being the reference to kingly power.{{sfn|Witherington|2001|p=52}}\n\n===Eschatology and salvation: The meaning of Christ's death, resurrection and return===\n[[Eschatology]] means the study of the end-times, and the Jews expected the [[messiah]] to be an [[eschatology|eschatological]] figure, a deliverer who would appear at the end of the age to usher in an earthly kingdom.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=69}} The earliest Jewish Christian community saw Jesus as a [[messiah]] in this Jewish sense, a human figure appointed by God as his earthly regent; but they also believed in Jesus' resurrection and exultation to heaven, and for this reason they also viewed him as God's agent (the \"son of God\") who would return in glory ushering in the [[Kingdom of God]].{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=155}}\n\nThe term \"[[Son of God]]\" likewise had a specific Jewish meaning, or range of meanings,{{sfn|Dunn|2003|pp=709\u201310}} one of the most significant being the earthly king adopted by God as his son at his enthronement, legitimising his rule over Israel.{{sfn|Strecker|2000|pp=81\u201382}} In Hellenistic culture, in contrast, the phrase meant a \"divine man\", covering legendary heroes like [[Hercules]], god-kings like the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s, or famous philosophers like [[Plato]].{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=69}} When the gospels call Jesus \"Son of God\" the intention is to place him in the class of Hellenistic and Greek divine men, the 'sons of God\" who were endowed with supernatural power to perform healings, exorcisms and other wonderful deeds.{{sfn|Strecker|2000|pp=81\u201382}} Mark's \"Son of David\" is Hellenistic, his Jesus predicting that his mission involves suffering, death and resurrection, and, by implication, not military glory and conquest.{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=52}} This reflects a move away from the Jewish-Christian apocalyptic tradition and towards the Hellenistic message preached by Paul, for whom Christ's death and resurrection, rather than the establishment of the apocalyptic Jewish kingdom, is the meaning of salvation, the \"gospel\".{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=155}}\n\n==Comparison with other writings==\n[[File:PericopesHenryIIFol117rAngelOnTomb.jpg|thumb|''\"Entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment\"''&nbsp;\u2013 Mark's description of the discovery of the empty tomb (from the [[Pericopes of Henry II]])]]\n\n===Mark and the New Testament===\nAll four gospels tell a story in which Jesus' death and resurrection are the crucial redemptive events.{{sfn|Hurtado|2005|p=587}} There are, however, important differences between the four: Unlike [[Gospel of John|John]], Mark never calls Jesus \"God\", or claims that Jesus existed prior to his earthly life;{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=158}} unlike [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], the author does not mention a virgin birth, and apparently believes that Jesus had a normal human parentage and birth;{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=158}} unlike Matthew and Luke, he makes no attempt to trace Jesus' ancestry back to [[King David]] or [[Adam]] with a genealogy.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=158}}\n\nChristians of Mark's time expected Jesus to return as Messiah in their own lifetime&nbsp;\u2013 Mark, like the other gospels, attributes the promise to Jesus himself (Mark 9:1 and 13:30), and it is reflected in the letters of [[apostle Paul|Paul]], in the [[epistle of James]], in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]], and in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. When return failed, the early Christians revised their understanding. Some acknowledged that the [[Second Coming]] had been delayed, but still expected it; others redefined the focus of the promise, the [[Gospel of John]], for example, speaking of \"eternal life\" as something available in the present; while still others concluded that Jesus would not return at all ([[2 Peter]] argues against those who held this view).{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nMark's despairing death of Jesus was changed to a more victorious one in subsequent gospels.{{sfn|Moyise|2013|p=unpaginated}} Mark's Christ dies with the cry, \"[[My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?]]\"; Matthew, the next gospel to be written, repeats this word for word but manages to make clear that Jesus's death is the beginning of the resurrection of Israel; Luke has a still more positive picture, replacing Mark's (and Matthew's) cry of despair with one of submission to God's will (\"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit\"); while John, the last gospel, has Jesus dying without apparent suffering in fulfillment of the divine plan.{{sfn|Moyise|2013|p=unpaginated}}\n\n===Sayings unique to Mark===\n* The [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] was made for man, not man for the Sabbath ({{bibleverse||Mark|2:27}}).<ref group=n name=\"note01\">Similar to a rabbinical saying from the 2nd century BC, \"The Sabbath is given over to you [\"the son of man\"], and not you to the Sabbath.\" [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=245&letter=N&search=Gospel#703 Misunderstood Passages]</ref> Not present in either {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:1\u20138}} or {{bibleverse||Luke|6:1\u20135}}.

Matthew and Luke share a large amount of additional material that is not found in Mark, and each also has a proportion of unique material.]]\n\nLuke\u2013Acts is a religio-political history of the Founder of the church and his successors, in both deeds and words. The author describes his book as a \"narrative\" (''diegesis''), rather than as a gospel, and implicitly criticises his predecessors for not giving their readers the speeches of Jesus and the Apostles, as such speeches were the mark of a \"full\" report, the vehicle through which ancient historians conveyed the meaning of their narratives. He seems to have taken as his model the works of two respected Classical authors, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], who wrote a history of Rome, and the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], author of a [[Antiquities of the Jews|history of the Jews]]. All three authors anchor the histories of their respective peoples  by dating the births of the founders (Romulus, Moses and Jesus) and narrate the stories of the founders' births from God, so that they are sons of God. Each founder taught authoritatively, appeared to witnesses after death, and ascended to heaven. Crucial aspects of the teaching of all three concerned the relationship between rich and poor and the question of whether \"foreigners\" were to be received into the people.{{sfn|Balch|2003|p=1104}}\n\nThe author seems to have used as his sources the [[gospel of Mark]], the sayings collection called the [[Q source]], and a collection of material called the [[L source|L (for Luke) source]].{{sfn|Johnson|2010|p=44}} Mark, written around 70 AD, provided the narrative outline, but Mark contains comparatively little of Jesus' teachings.{{sfn|Hurtado|2005|p=284}} For these Luke turned to Q, which consisted mostly, although not exclusively, of \"sayings\".{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|p=82}} (Most scholars are reasonably sure that Q existed and that it can be reconstructed).{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|p=80}} Mark and Q account for about 64% of Luke. The remaining material, known as the [[L source]], is of unknown origin and date.{{sfn|Powell|1998|pp=39\u201340}} Most Q and L-source material is grouped in two clusters, Luke 6:17\u20138:3 and 9:51\u201318:14, and L-source material forms the first two sections of the gospel (the preface and infancy and childhood narratives).{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=204}}\n\n===Audience and authorial intent===\nLuke was written to be read aloud to a group of Jesus-followers gathered in a house to share the Lord's supper.{{sfn|Balch|2003|p=1104}} The author assumes an educated Greek-speaking audience, but directs his attention to specifically Christian concerns rather than to the Greco-Roman world at large.{{sfn|Green|1995|pp=16\u201317}} He begins his gospel with a preface addressed to \"Theophilus\": the name means \"Lover of God,\" and could be an individual or simply any Christian. Here he informs Theophilus of his intention, which is to lead his reader to certainty through an orderly account \"of the events that have been fulfilled among us.\"{{sfn|Green|1997|p=35}} He did not, however, intend to provide Theophilus with a historical justification of the Christian faith \u2013 \"did it happen?\" \u2013 but to encourage faith \u2013 \"what happened, and what does it all mean?\"{{sfn|Green|1997|p=36}}\n\n==Structure and content==\n{{Content of Luke}}\n\n===Structure of Luke's Gospel===\nFollowing the author's preface addressed to his patron and the two birth narratives (John the Baptist and Jesus), the gospel opens in Galilee and moves gradually to its climax in Jerusalem:{{sfn|Carroll|2012|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n# A brief preface addressed to Theophilus stating the author's aims;\n# Birth and infancy narratives for both Jesus and John the Baptist, interpreted as the dawn of the promised era of Israel's salvation;\n# Preparation for Jesus' messianic mission: John's prophetic mission, his baptism of Jesus, and the testing of Jesus' vocation;\n# The beginning of Jesus' mission in Galilee, and the hostile reception there;\n# The central section: the journey to Jerusalem, where Jesus knows he must meet his destiny as God's prophet and messiah;\n# His mission in Jerusalem, culminating in confrontation with the leaders of the Jewish Temple;\n# His last supper with his most intimate followers, followed by his arrest, interrogation, and crucifixion;\n# God's validation of Jesus as Christ: events from the first Easter to the Ascension, showing Jesus' death to be divinely ordained, in keeping with both scriptural promise and the nature of messiahship, and anticipating the story of Acts.<ref group=\"Notes\">For studies of the literary structure of this Gospel, see recent contributions of Bailey, Goulder and Talbert, in particular for their readings of Luke's Central Section. (Almost all scholars believe the section begins at 9.51;  strong case, however, can be put for 9.43b.) Then the introductory pieces to the opening and closing parts that frame the teaching of the Central Section would exhibit a significant dualism: compare 9.43b\u201345 and 18.31\u201335. The Central Section would then be defined as 9.43b\u201319.48, 'Jesus Journey to Jerusalem and its Temple'. Between the opening part ('His Setting out', 9.43b\u201310.24) and the closing part ('His Arriving', 18.31\u201319.48) lies a chiasm of parts 1\u20135,C,5'\u20131', 'His Teachings on the Way': 1, 10.25\u201342 Inheriting eternal life: law and love; 2, 11.1\u201313 Prayer: right praying, persistence, Holy Spirit is given; 3, 11.14\u201312.12 The Kingdom of God: what is internal is important; 4, 12.13\u201348 Earthly and Heavenly riches; the coming of the Son of Man; 5, 12.49\u201313.9 Divisions, warning and prudence, repentance; C, 13.10\u201314.24 a Sabbath healing, kingdom and entry (13.10\u201330), Jesus is to die in Jerusalem, his lament for it (13.31\u201335), a Sabbath healing, banqueting in the kingdom (14.1\u201324); 5', 14.25\u201315.32 Divisions, warning and prudence, repentance; 4', 16.1\u201331 Earthly and Heavenly riches: the coming judgement; 3', 17.1\u201337 The kingdom of God is 'within', not coming with signs; 2', 18.1\u201317 Prayer: persistence, right praying, receiving the kingdom; 1', 18.18\u201330 Inheriting eternal life: law and love. (All the parts 1\u20135 and 5'\u20131' are constructed of three parts in the style of ABB'.)</ref>\n\n===Parallel structure of Luke\u2013Acts===\nThe structure of Acts parallels the structure of the gospel, demonstrating the universality of the divine plan and the shift of authority from Jerusalem to Rome:{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=569}}\n\n''The gospel \u2013 the acts of Jesus'':\n* The presentation of the child Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem\n* Jesus' forty days in the desert\n* Jesus in Samaria/Judea\n* Jesus in the Decapolis\n* Jesus receives the Holy Spirit\n* Jesus preaches with power (the power of the spirit)\n* Jesus heals the sick\n* Death of Jesus\n* The apostles are sent to preach to all nations\n\n''The acts of the apostles''\n* Jerusalem\n* Forty days before the Ascension\n* Samaria\n* Asia Minor\n* Pentecost: Christ's followers receive the spirit\n* The apostles preach with the power of the spirit\n* The apostles heal the sick\n* Death of Stephen, the first martyr for Christ\n* Paul preaches in Rome\n\n==Theology==\n[[File:Representation of the Sower's parable.JPEG|thumb|left|Parable of the Sower (Biserica Ortodox\u0103 din Deal, Cluj-Napoca), [[Romania]])]]\n\n===Luke's \"salvation history\"===\nLuke's theology is expressed primarily through his overarching plot, the way scenes, themes and characters combine to construct his specific worldview.{{sfn|Allen|2009|p=326}} His \"salvation history\" stretches from the Creation to the present time of his readers, in three ages: first, the time of \"the Law and the Prophets\", the period beginning with Genesis and ending with the appearance of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5\u20133:1); second, the epoch of Jesus, in which the [[Kingdom of God]] was preached (Luke 3:2\u201324:51); and finally the period of the Church, which began when the risen Christ was taken into Heaven, and would end with his [[second coming of Christ|second coming]].{{sfn|Evans|2011|p=no page numbers}}\n\n===Christology===\nLuke's understanding of Jesus \u2013 his [[Christology]] \u2013 is central to his theology. One approach to this is through the titles Luke gives to Jesus: these include, but are not limited to, Christ ([[Messiah]]), Lord, [[Son of God]], and [[Son of Man]].{{sfn|Powell|1989|p=60}} Another is by reading Luke in the context of similar Greco-Roman divine saviour figures (Roman emperors are an example), references which would have made clear to Luke's readers that Jesus was the greatest of all saviours.{{sfn|Powell|1989|pp=63\u201365}} A third is to approach Luke through his use of the Old Testament, those passages from Jewish scripture which he cites to establish that Jesus is the promised Messiah.{{sfn|Powell|1989|p=66}} While much of this is familiar, much also is missing: for example, Luke makes no clear reference to Christ's pre-existence or to the Christian's union with Christ, and makes relatively little reference to the concept of atonement: perhaps he felt no need to mention these ideas, or disagreed with them, or possibly he was simply unaware of them.{{sfn|Buckwalter|1996|p=4}}\n\n[[Image:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo 023.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Annunciation'' ([[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo|Murillo]])]]\nEven what Luke does say about Christ is ambiguous or even contradictory.{{sfn|Buckwalter|1996|p=4}} For example, according to Luke 2:11 Jesus was the Christ at his birth, but in Acts 10:37\u201338 he becomes Christ at the resurrection, while in Acts 3:20 it seems his messiahship is active only at the [[parousia]], the \"[[second coming of Christ|second coming]]\"; similarly, in Luke 2:11 he is the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Saviour]] from birth, but in Acts 5:31 he is made Saviour at the resurrection; and he is born the [[Son of God]] in Luke 1:32\u201335, but becomes the Son of God at the resurrection according to Acts 13:33.{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=65}} Many of these differences may be due to scribal error, but others were deliberate alterations to doctrinally unacceptable passages, or the introduction by scribes of \"proofs\" for their favourite theological tenets.{{sfn|Miller|2011|p=63}} An important example of such deliberate alterations is found in Luke's account of the baptism of Jesus, where virtually all the earliest witnesses have God saying, \"This day I have begotten you.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=66}} (Luke has taken the words of God from Psalm 2, an ancient royal adoption formula in which the king of Israel was recognised as God's elect).{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=66}} This reading is theologically difficult, as it implies that God is now conferring status on Jesus that he did not previously hold.{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=66}} It is unlikely, therefore, that the more common reading of Luke 3:22 (God says to Jesus, \"You are my beloved son, with you I am well pleased\") is original.{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=66}}\n\n===The Holy Spirit, the Christian community, and the kingdom of God===\nThe Holy Spirit plays a more important role in Luke\u2013Acts than in the other gospels. Some scholars have argued that the Spirit's involvement in the career of Jesus is paradigmatic of the universal Christian experience, others that Luke's intention was to stress Jesus' uniqueness as the Prophet of the final age.{{sfn|Powell|1989|pp=108\u201311}} It is clear, however, that Luke understands the enabling power of the Spirit, expressed through non-discriminatory fellowship (\"All who believed were together and had all things in common\"), to be the basis of the Christian community.{{sfn|Powell|1989|p=111}} This community can also be understood as the [[Kingdom of God]], although the kingdom's final consummation will not be seen till the [[Son of Man]] comes \"on a cloud\" at the end-time.{{sfn|Holladay|2011|p=no page number}}\n\n===Christians vs. Rome and the Jews===\n{{see also|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire}}\nLuke needed to define the position of Christians in relation to two political and social entities, the Roman Empire and Judaism. Regarding the Empire Luke makes clear that, while Christians are not a threat to the established order, the rulers of this world hold their power from Satan, and the essential loyalty of Christ's followers is to God and this world will be the kingdom of God, ruled by Christ the King.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=562}} Regarding the Jews, Luke emphasises the fact that Jesus and all his earliest followers were Jews, although by his time the majority of Christ-followers were gentiles; nevertheless, the Jews had rejected and killed the Messiah, and the Christian mission now lay with the gentiles.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=563}}\n\n==Comparison with other writings==\n[[File:1602-3 Caravaggio,Supper at Emmaus National Gallery, London.jpg|300px|left|thumb|''[[Supper at Emmaus (Caravaggio), London|Supper at Emmaus]]'' (1601), [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]], [[National Gallery]].]]\n\nThe gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and Luke share so much in common that they are called the [[Synoptic gospels|Synoptics]], as they frequently cover the same events in similar and sometimes identical language. The majority opinion among scholars is that Mark was the earliest of the three (about 70 AD) and that Matthew and Luke both used this work and the \"sayings gospel\" known as [[Q source|Q]] as their basic sources. Luke has both expanded Mark and refined his grammar and syntax, as Mark's Greek writing is less elegant. Some passages from Mark he has eliminated entirely, notably most of chapters 6 and 7, which he apparently felt reflected poorly on the disciples and painted Jesus too much like a magician. Despite this, he follows Mark's narrative more faithfully than does Matthew.{{sfn|Johnson|2010|p=48}}\n\nDespite being grouped with Matthew and Mark, Luke's gospel has a number of parallels with the [[Gospel of John]]. For example, Luke uses the terms \"Jews\" and \"Israelites\" in a way unlike Mark, but like John; the figures of [[Mary of Bethany]] and [[Martha]] as well as a person named Lazarus (although [[Lazarus of Bethany]] and the Lazarus of [[Rich man and Lazarus|the parable]] are generally not considered the same person) are found only in Luke and John; and at Jesus' arrest, only Luke and John state that the servant's ''right'' ear was cut off (there are several such small details found only in Luke and John).{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=576}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Gospel}}\n* [[Authorship of Luke\u2013Acts]]\n* [[List of Gospels]]\n* [[List of omitted Bible verses]]\n* [[Marcion]]\n* [[Order of St. Luke]]\n* [[Synoptic Gospels]]\n* [[Synoptic problem]]\n* [[Textual variants in the New Testament#Gospel of Luke|Textual variants in the Gospel of Luke]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist |group=\"Notes\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book\n|last = Allen\n|first = O.

Besides these, there exist manuscript fragments ranging from a few verses to whole chapters.  {{Papyrus link|104}} and {{Papyrus link|67}} are notable fragments of Matthew.  These are copies of copies. In the process of recopying, variations slipped in, different regional [[Manuscript culture|manuscript traditions]] emerged, and [[Historicity of the Bible|corrections and adjustments were made]]. Modern [[textual criticism|textual scholars]] [[Cladogram|collate all major surviving manuscripts]], as well as citations in the works of the [[Church Fathers]], in order to produce a text which most likely approximates to the lost autographs.{{sfn|Wallace|2011}}\n\n=== Authorship and sources ===\n[[File:Relationship between synoptic gospels-en.svg|350px|right|Matthew's sources include the [[Gospel of Mark]], the \"shared tradition\" called [[Q source|Q]], and material unique to Matthew, called [[M source|M]].]]\nThe gospel itself does not specify an author, but he was probably a male [[Jew]], standing on the margin between traditional and non-traditional Jewish values, and familiar with technical legal aspects of scripture being debated in his time.{{sfn|Duling|2010|p=302}} The majority of modern scholars believe that Mark was the [[Marcan priority|first gospel to be composed]] and that Matthew (who includes some 600 of Mark's 661 verses) and Luke both drew upon it as a major source for their works.{{sfn|Turner|2008|pp=6\u20137}}{{sfn|Senior|1996|p=22}} The author of Matthew did not, however, simply copy Mark, but used it as a base, emphasising Jesus' place in the Jewish tradition and including other details not covered in Mark.{{sfn|Harrington|1991|pp=5\u20136}} An additional 220 (approximately) verses, shared by Matthew and Luke but not found in Mark, from a second source, a hypothetical collection of sayings to which scholars give the name \"Quelle\" (\"source\" in the German language), or the [[Q source]].{{sfn|McMahon|2008|p=57}} This view, known as the [[Two-source hypothesis]] (Mark and Q), allows for a further body of tradition known as \"Special Matthew\", or the [[M source]], meaning material unique to Matthew; this may represent a separate source, or it may come from the author's church, or he may have composed these verses himself.{{sfn|Senior|1996|p=22}} The author also had the Greek scriptures at his disposal, both as book-scrolls (Greek translations of [[book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], the [[Psalms]] etc.) and in the form of \"testimony collections\" (collections of excerpts), and, if Papias is correct, probably oral stories of his community.{{sfn|Beaton|2005|p=116}} These sources were predominantly in Greek,{{sfn|Nolland|2005|p=3}} but mostly not from any known version of the [[Septuagint]];{{sfn|Duling|2010|p=314}} although a few scholars hold that some of them may have been Greek translations of older Hebrew or Aramaic sources.{{sfn|Casey|2010|pages=87\u201388}}{{sfn|Davies|Allison|1988|pages=12\u201313}}\n\n=== Setting and date ===\nThe majority view among scholars is that Matthew was a product of the last quarter of the 1st century.{{sfn|Davies|Allison|1988|p=128}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Date\">This view is based on three arguments: (a) the setting reflects the final separation of Church and Synagogue, about 85 AD; (b) it reflects the capture of Rome and destruction of the Temple by the Romans in 70 AD; (c) it uses Mark, usually dated around 70 AD, as a source.

France himself is not convinced by the majority \u2013 see his Commentary, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> This makes it a work of the second generation of Christians, for whom the defining event was the destruction of Jerusalem and the [[Second Temple|Temple]] by the Romans in AD 70 in the course of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]] (AD 66\u201373); from this point on, what had begun with [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as a Jewish [[messiah|messianic movement]] became an increasingly Gentile phenomenon evolving in time into a separate religion.{{sfn|Scholtz|2009|pp=34\u201335}}\nThe Christian community to which Matthew belonged, like many 1st-century Christians, was still part of the larger Jewish community: hence the designation [[Jewish Christian]] to describe them.{{sfn|Saldarini|1994|p=4}} The relationship of Matthew to this wider world of Judaism remains a subject of study and contention, the principal question being to what extent, if any, Matthew's community had cut itself off from its Jewish roots.{{sfn|Senior|2001|pp=7\u20138, 72}} Certainly there was conflict between Matthew's group and other Jewish groups, and it is generally agreed that the root of the conflict was the Matthew community's belief in Jesus as the Messiah and authoritative interpreter of the law, as one risen from the dead and uniquely endowed with divine authority.{{sfn|Senior|2001|p=11}}\n\nThe author of Matthew wrote for a community of Greek-speaking Jewish Christians located probably in Syria (Antioch, the largest city in Roman Syria and the third-largest in the empire, is often mentioned).{{sfn|Nolland|2005|p=18}} Unlike Mark, Matthew never bothers to explain Jewish customs, since his intended audience was a Jewish one; unlike Luke, who traces Jesus' ancestry back to Adam, father of the human race, he traces it only to Abraham, father of the Jews; of his three presumed sources only \"M\", the material from his own community, refers to a \"church\" (''ecclesia''), an organised group with rules for keeping order; and the content of \"M\" suggests that this community was strict in keeping the Jewish law, holding that they must exceed the scribes and the Pharisees in \"righteousness\" (adherence to Jewish law).{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=180\u201381}} Writing from within a Jewish-Christian community growing increasingly distant from other Jews and becoming increasingly Gentile in its membership and outlook, Matthew put down in his gospel his vision \"of an assembly or church in which both Jew and Gentile would flourish together\".{{sfn|Senior|2001|p=19}}\n\n== Structure and content ==\n{{Content of Matthew}}\n[[File:Minuscule 447.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Beginning of the Gospel of Matthew in [[Minuscule 447]]]]\n[[Image:KellsFol034rChiRhoMonogram.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Chi Rho monogram]] from the [[Book of Kells]] is the most lavish such monogram]]\nMatthew, alone among the gospels, alternates five blocks of narrative with five of discourse, marking each off with the phrase \"When Jesus had finished...\"{{sfn|Turner|2008|p=9}} (see [[Five Discourses of Matthew]]). Some scholars see in this a deliberate plan to create a parallel to the first five books of the Old Testament; others see a three-part structure based around the idea of Jesus as [[Messiah]]; or a set of weekly readings spread out over the year; or no plan at all.{{sfn|Davies|Allison|1988|pp=59\u201361}} Davies and Allison, in their widely used commentary, draw attention to the use of \"triads\" (the gospel groups things in threes),{{sfn|Davies|Allison|1988|pp=62ff}} and [[Richard Thomas France|R. T. France]], in another influential commentary, notes the geographic movement from Galilee to Jerusalem and back, with the post-resurrection appearances in Galilee as the culmination of the whole story.{{sfn|France|2007|pp=2ff}}\n\n===Prologue: genealogy, Nativity and infancy===\n{{Main article|Genealogy of Jesus|Nativity of Jesus}}\nThe Gospel of Matthew begins with the words \"The Book of Genealogy [in Greek, \"Genesis\"] of Jesus Christ\", deliberately echoing the words of Genesis 2:4 in the [[Septuagint|Old Testament in Greek]].<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Genesis\">France, p. 26 note 1, and p. 28: \"The first two words of Matthew's gospel are literally \"book of genesis\".</ref> The genealogy tells of Jesus' descent from [[Abraham]] and [[King David]] and the miraculous events surrounding his [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]],<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Joseph\">France, p. 28 note 7:  \"All MSS and versions agree in making it explicit that Joseph was not Jesus' father, with the one exception of sys, which reads \"Joseph, to whom was betrothed Mary the virgin, begot Jesus.\"</ref> and the infancy narrative tells of the [[Massacre of the Innocents|massacre of the innocents]], [[Flight into Egypt|the flight into Egypt]], and eventual journey to Nazareth.\n\n=== First narrative and discourse ===\n{{Main article|Baptism of Jesus|Sermon on the Mount}}\nThe first narrative section begins. [[John the Baptist|John]] baptizes Jesus, and the Holy Spirit descends upon him. Jesus prays and meditates in the wilderness for forty days, and is tempted by [[Satan]]. His early ministry by word and deed in Galilee meets with much success, and leads to the Sermon on the Mount, the first of the discourses. The sermon presents the ethics of the [[kingdom of God]], introduced by the [[Beatitudes]] (\"Blessed are...\"). It concludes with a reminder that the response to the kingdom will have eternal consequences, and the crowd's amazed response leads into the next narrative block.{{sfn|Turner|2008|p=101}}\n\n=== Second narrative and discourse ===\nFrom the authoritative words of Jesus the gospel turns to three sets of three [[miracles of Jesus|miracles]] interwoven with two sets of two [[disciples of Jesus|discipleship]] stories (the second narrative), followed by a discourse on mission and suffering.{{sfn|Turner|2008|p=226}} Jesus commissions the [[Twelve Disciples]] and sends them to preach to the Jews, perform miracles, and prophesy the imminent coming of the Kingdom, commanding them to travel lightly, without staff or sandals.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=}}\n\n=== Third narrative and discourse ===\nOpposition to Jesus comes to a head with accusations that his deeds are done through the power of Satan; Jesus in turn accuses his opponents of blaspheming the Holy Spirit. The discourse is a set of [[Parables of Jesus|parables]] emphasising the sovereignty of God, and concluding with a challenge to the disciples to understand the teachings as scribes of the kingdom of heaven.{{sfn|Turner|2008|p=285}} (Matthew avoids using the [[names of God in Judaism|holy word God]] in the expression \"Kingdom of God\"; instead he prefers the term \"Kingdom of Heaven\", reflecting the Jewish tradition of not speaking the name of God).{{sfn|Browning|2004|p=248}}\n\n=== Fourth narrative and discourse ===\n{{main article|Confession of Peter}}\nThe fourth narrative section reveals that the increasing opposition to Jesus will result in his crucifixion in Jerusalem, and that his disciples must therefore prepare for his absence.{{sfn|Turner|2008|p=265}} The instructions for the post-crucifixion church emphasize responsibility and humility. (This section contains Matthew 16:13\u201319, in which Simon, newly renamed Peter, (\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, ''petros,'' meaning \"stone\"), calls Jesus \"the Christ, the son of the living God\", and Jesus states that on this \"bedrock\" (\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, ''petra'') he will build his church: this passage forms the foundation for the [[papacy]]'s [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|claim of authority]]).\n\n=== Fifth narrative and discourse ===\n{{Main article|Second Coming}}\nJesus travels toward Jerusalem, and the opposition intensifies: he is tested by [[Pharisees]] as soon as he begins to move towards the city, and when he arrives he is soon in conflict with the Temple's traders and religious leaders. He teaches in the Temple, debating with the chief priests and religious leaders and speaking in parables about the Kingdom of God and the failings of the chief priests and the Pharisees. The [[Herodians|Herodian]] caucus also become involved in a scheme to entangle Jesus (Matthew 22:15\u201316), but Jesus' careful response to their enquiry, \"Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s, and to God the things that are God\u2019s\" (Matthew 22:21), leaves them marveling at his words (Matthew 22:22).\n\nThe disciples ask about the future, and in his final discourse (the [[Olivet Discourse]]) Jesus speaks of the coming end.{{sfn|Turner|2008|p=445}} There will be false Messiahs, earthquakes, and persecutions, the sun, moon, and stars will fail, but \"this generation\" will not pass away before all the prophecies are fulfilled.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=}} The disciples must steel themselves for ministry to all the nations. At the end of the discourse, Matthew notes that Jesus has finished all his words, and attention turns to the crucifixion.{{sfn|Turner|2008|p=445}}\n\n=== Conclusion: Passion, Resurrection and Great Commission ===\nThe events of Jesus' last week occupy a third of the content of all four gospels.{{sfn|Turner|2008|p=613}} Jesus [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|enters Jerusalem in triumph]] and drives the money changers from the temple, holds a [[last supper]], prays to be spared the coming agony (but concludes \"if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done\"), and is betrayed. He is tried by the Jewish leaders (the [[Sanhedrin]]) and before [[Pontius Pilate]], and Pilate washes his hands to indicate that he does not assume responsibility. Jesus is crucified as king of the Jews, [[Mocking of Jesus|mocked]] by all. On his death there is an earthquake, the veil of the Temple is rent, and saints rise from their tombs. [[Mary Magdalene]] and [[Mary, the mother of James|another Mary]] discover the empty tomb, guarded by an [[angel]], and Jesus himself tells them to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.\n\nAfter the resurrection the remaining disciples return to Galilee, \"to the mountain that Jesus had appointed\", where he comes to them and tells them that he has been given \"all authority in heaven and on Earth.\" He gives the Great Commission: \"Therefore go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you\". Jesus will be with them \"to the very end of the age\".{{sfn|Turner|2008|pp=687\u201388}}\n\n== Theology ==\n[[Image:Matthew Evangelist Incunabula Koberger Bible wiki.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut from [[Anton Koberger]]'s Bible (Nuremberg, 1483): The angelically inspired Saint Matthew musters the Old Testament figures, led by [[Abraham]] and [[David]]]]\n\n=== Christology ===\n[[Christology]] is the theological doctrine of Christ, \"the affirmations and definitions of Christ's humanity and deity\".{{sfn|Levison|Pope-Levison|2009|p=167}} There is a variety of Christologies in the New Testament, albeit with a single centre\u2014Jesus is the figure in whom God has acted for mankind's salvation.{{sfn|Fuller|2001|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nMatthew has taken over his key Christological texts from Mark, but sometimes he has changed the stories he found in Mark, giving evidence of his own concerns.{{sfn|Tuckett|2001|p=119}} The title [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament#Son of David|Son of David]] identifies Jesus as the healing and miracle-working Messiah of Israel (it is used exclusively in relation to miracles), and the Jewish messiah is sent to Israel alone.{{sfn|Luz|1995|pp=86, 111}} As [[Son of Man]] he will return to judge the world, a fact his disciples recognise but of which his enemies are unaware.{{sfn|Luz|1995|pp=91, 97}} As [[Son of God]] he is named [[Immanuel]] (God with us) ({{Bibleverse|Matthew|1:23|ASV}}), God revealing himself through his son, and Jesus proving his sonship through his obedience and example.{{sfn|Luz|1995|p=93}}\n\n=== Relationship with the Jews ===\nMatthew's prime concern was that the Jewish tradition should not be lost in a church that was increasingly becoming gentile.{{sfn|Davies|Allison|1997|p=722}} This concern lies behind the frequent citations of Jewish scripture, the evocation of Jesus as the new Moses along with other events from Jewish history, and the concern to present Jesus as fulfilling, not destroying, the Law.{{sfn|Senior|2001|pp=17\u201318}} Matthew must have been aware of the tendency to distort Paul's teaching of the law no longer having power over the New Testament Christian into [[antinomianism]], and addressed Christ's fulfilling of what the Israelites expected from the \"Law and the Prophets\" in an eschatological sense, in that he was all that the Old Testament had predicted in the Messiah. {{sfn|France|2007|pp=179\u201381, 185\u201386}}\n\nThe gospel has been interpreted as reflecting the struggles and conflicts between the evangelist's community and the other Jews, particularly with its sharp criticism of the scribes and Pharisees.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=182}} Prior to the [[Crucifixion]] the Jews are called [[Israelites]], the honorific title of God's chosen people; after it, they are called \"[[Ioudaioi]]\", Jews, a sign that through their rejection of the Christ the \"[[Kingship and kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]]\" has been taken away from them and given instead to the church.{{sfn|Strecker|2000|pp=369\u201370}}\n\n== Comparison with other writings ==\n\n=== Christological development ===\nThe divine nature of Jesus was a major issue for the community of Matthew, the crucial element marking them from their Jewish neighbors. Early understandings of this nature grew as the gospels were being written. Before the gospels, that understanding was focused on the revelation of Jesus as God in his resurrection, but the gospels reflect a broadened focus extended backwards in time.{{sfn|Peppard|2011|p=133}} The gospel of Mark recounts prior revelations in Jesus' lifetime on earth, at his baptism and transfiguration. Matthew and Luke go back further still, showing Jesus as the Son of God from his birth. Matthew more than all the other gospels identifies how his coming to earth was the fulfillment of many Old Testament prophecies. Finally John calls God the Word (Jesus) pre-existent before [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]], and thus before all time.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\nMatthew is a creative reinterpretation of Mark,{{sfn|Beaton|2005|p=117}} stressing Jesus' teachings as much as his acts,{{sfn|Morris|1986|p=114}} and making subtle changes in order to stress his divine nature: for example, Mark's \"young man\" who appears at Jesus' tomb becomes \"a radiant angel\" in Matthew.{{sfn|Beaton|2005|p=123}} The miracle stories in Mark do not demonstrate the divinity of Jesus, but rather confirm his status as an emissary of God (which was Mark's understanding of the Messiah).{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=59}}\n\n=== Chronology ===\nThere is a broad disagreement {{citation needed|date=June 2018}} over chronology between Matthew, Mark and Luke on one hand and John on the other: all four agree that Jesus' public ministry began with an encounter with John the Baptist, but Matthew, Mark and Luke follow this with an account of teaching and healing in Galilee, then a trip to Jerusalem where there is an incident in the Temple, climaxing with the crucifixion on the day of the [[Passover]] holiday. [[Gospel of John|John]], by contrast, puts the Temple incident very early in Jesus' ministry, has several trips to Jerusalem, and puts the crucifixion immediately before the Passover holiday, on the day when the lambs for the Passover meal were being sacrificed in Temple.{{sfn|Levine|2001|p=373}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Authorship of the Bible]]\n* [[Gospel of the Ebionites]]\n* [[Gospel of the Hebrews]]\n* [[Gospel of the Nazarenes]]\n* [[Hebrew Gospel hypothesis]]\n* ''[[The Visual Bible: Matthew]]''\n* ''[[Il vangelo secondo Matteo]]'', a film by [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]\n* [[Jewish\u2013Christian gospels]]\n* [[List of omitted Bible verses]]\n* [[Sermon on the Mount]]\n* ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' \u2013 an oratorio by [[J.

The section ends with a conclusion on the purpose of the gospel: \"that [the reader] may believe that Jesus is the [[Christ]], the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.\"{{sfn|Edwards|2015|p=171}}\n*Chapter 21 tells of Jesus' post-resurrection appearance to his disciples in Galilee, the [[miraculous catch of fish]], the prophecy of the [[Saint Peter|crucifixion of Peter]], the [[restoration of Peter]], and the fate of the [[Beloved Disciple]].{{sfn|Edwards|2015|p=171}}\n\nThe structure is highly schematic: there are seven \"signs\" culminating in the [[raising of Lazarus]] (foreshadowing the [[resurrection of Jesus]]), and seven \"I am\" sayings and discourses, culminating in Thomas's proclamation of the risen Jesus as \"my Lord and my God\" (the same title, ''dominus et deus'', claimed by the Emperor [[Domitian]], an indication of the date of composition).{{sfn|Witherington|2004|p=83}}\n\n==Theology==\n[[File:P52 recto.jpg|thumb|The [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52|Rylands Papyrus]] the oldest known New Testament fragment, dated from its handwriting to about 125.]]\n===Christology===\n{{Further information|Christology}}\nJohn's \"high Christology\" depicts Jesus as divine, preexistent, and identified with the one God,{{sfn|Hurtado|2005|p=51}} talking openly about his divine role and echoing [[Yahweh]]'s \"[[I Am that I Am]]\" with seven \"[[I am (biblical term)|I Am]]\" declarations of his own.{{refn|group=Notes|{{sfn|Harris|2006|pp=302\u201310}}\n* \"I am the [[Bread of Life Discourse|bread of life]]\"{{bibleref2c-nb|John|6:35|DRA}}\n* \"I am the [[light of the world]]\"{{Bibleref2c-nb|John|8:12|DRA}}\n* \"I am the gate for the sheep\"{{Bibleref2c-nb|John|10:7|DRA}}\n* \"I am the [[good shepherd]]\"{{Bibleref2c-nb|John|10:11|DRA}}\n* \"I am the resurrection and the life\"{{Bibleref2c-nb|John|11:25|DRA}}\n* \"I am [[the way, the truth, and the life|the way and the truth and the life]]\"{{Bibleref2c-nb|John|14:6|DRA}}\n* \"I am the [[true vine]]\"{{Bibleref2c-nb|John|15:1|DRA}}}}\n\n===Logos===\n{{Main article|Logos (Christianity)}}\nIn the prologue, John identifies Jesus as the Logos (Word). In [[Ancient Greek philosophy]], the term ''[[logos]]'' meant the principle of cosmic reason. In this sense, it was similar to the Hebrew concept of [[Sophia (wisdom)|Wisdom]], God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The [[Hellenistic Jewish]] philosopher [[Philo]] merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] of the Logos.{{sfn|Harris|2006|pp=302\u201310}}\n\n===Cross===\nThe portrayal of Jesus' death in John is unique among the four Gospels.  It does not appear to rely on the kinds of atonement theology indicative of vicarious sacrifice (cf. Mk 10:45, Rom 3:25) but rather presents the death of Jesus as his glorification and return to the father.  Likewise, the three \"passion predictions\" of the Synoptic Gospels (Mk 8:31, 9:31, 10:33\u201334 and pars.) are replaced instead in John with three instances of Jesus explaining how he will be exalted or \"lifted up\"(Jn 3:14, 8:28, 12:32).  The verb for \"lifted up\" reflects the double entendre at work in John's theology of the cross, for Jesus is both physically elevated from the earth at the crucifixion but also, at the same time, exalted and glorified.<ref>Robert Kysar, \"John: The Maverick Gospel\" (Louisville: Westminster John Knox), 1976, pp. 49\u201354</ref>\n\n===Sacraments===\n{{Further information|Sacrament}}\nAmong the most controversial areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to the sacraments at all, and on the degree of importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers to one of these questions do not always correspond to their answer to the other.{{sfn|Bauckham|2015}}\n\n====Frequency of allusion====\nAccording to [[Rudolf Bultmann]], there are three sacramental allusions: one to [[baptism]] ({{bibleref2|John|3:5|DRA|3:5}}), one to the [[Eucharist]] ({{bibleref2|John|6:51\u201358|DRA|6:51\u201358}}), and one to both ({{bibleref2|John|19:34|DRA|19:34}}). He believed these passages to be later interpolations, though most scholars now reject this assessment. Some scholars on the weaker-sacramental side of the spectrum deny that there are any sacramental allusions in these passages or in the gospel as a whole, while others see sacramental [[Religious symbols|symbolism]] applied to other subjects in these and other passages. [[Oscar Cullmann]] and [[Bruce Vawter]], a [[Protestant]] and a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] respectively, and both on the stronger-sacramental end of the spectrum, have found sacramental allusions in most chapters. Cullmann found references to baptism and the Eucharist throughout the gospel, and Vawter found additional references to [[Christian views on marriage|matrimony]] in {{bibleref2|John|2:1\u201311|DRA|2:1\u201311}}, [[anointing of the sick]] in {{bibleref2|John|12:1\u201311|DRA|12:1\u201311}}, and [[Penance#Penance as a sacrament|penance]] in {{bibleref2|John|20:22\u201323|DRA|20:22\u201323}}. Towards the center of the spectrum, [[Raymond E. Brown|Raymond Brown]] is more cautious than Cullmann and Vawter but more lenient than Bultmann and his school, identifying several passages as containing sacramental allusions and rating them according to his assessment of their degree of certainty.{{sfn|Bauckham|2015}}\n\n====Importance to the evangelist====\nMost scholars on the stronger-sacramental end of the spectrum assess the sacraments as being of great importance to the evangelist. However, some scholars who find fewer sacramental references, such as [[Udo Schnelle]], view the references that they find as highly important as well. Schnelle in particular views John's sacramentalism as a counter to [[Docetist]] anti-sacramentalism. On the other hand, though he agrees that there are anti-Docetic passages, [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] views the absence of a Eucharistic institution narrative as evidence for an anti-sacramentalism in John, meant to warn against a conception of eternal life as dependent on physical ritual.{{sfn|Bauckham|2015}}\n\n===Individualism===\nIn comparison to the synoptic gospels, the Fourth Gospel is markedly individualistic, in the sense that it places emphasis more on the individual's relation to Jesus than on the corporate nature of the Church.{{sfn|Bauckham|2015}}{{sfn|Moule|1962|p=172}} This is largely accomplished through the consistently singular grammatical structure of various aphoristic sayings of Jesus throughout the gospel.{{sfn|Bauckham|2015}}<ref group=Notes>Bauckham (2015) contrasts John's consistent use of the third person singular (\"The one who&nbsp;...\"; \"If anyone&nbsp;...\"; \"Everyone who&nbsp;...\"; \"Whoever&nbsp;...\"; \"No one&nbsp;...\") with the alternative third person plural constructions he could have used instead (\"Those who&nbsp;...\"; \"\"All those who&nbsp;...\"; etc.). He also notes that the sole exception occurs in the prologue, serving a narrative purpose, whereas the later aphorisms serve a \"paraenetic function\".</ref> According to [[Richard Bauckham]], emphasis on believers coming into a new group upon their conversion is conspicuously absent from John.{{sfn|Bauckham|2015}} There is also a theme of \"personal coinherence\", that is, the intimate personal relationship between the believer and Jesus in which the believer \"abides\" in Jesus and Jesus in the believer.{{sfn|Moule|1962|p=172}}{{sfn|Bauckham|2015}}<ref group=Notes>See {{bibleref2|John|6:56|DRA}}, {{bibleref2|John|10:14\u201315|DRA|10:14\u201315}}, {{bibleref2|John|10:38|DRA|10:38}}, and {{bibleref2|John|14:10, 17, 20, 23|DRA|14:10, 17, 20, and 23}}.</ref>  According to [[C. F. D. Moule]], the individualistic tendencies of the Fourth Gospel could potentially give rise to a [[realized eschatology]] achieved on the level of the individual believer; this realized eschatology is not, however, to replace \"orthodox\", futurist eschatological expectations, but is to be \"only [their] correlative.\"{{sfn|Moule|1962|p=174}} Some have argued that the Beloved Disciple is meant to be all followers of Jesus, inviting all into such a personal relationship with Christ. Beyond this, the emphasis on the individual's relationship with Jesus in the Gospel has suggested its usefulness for contemplation on the life of Christ.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shea, SJ|first=Henry J.|date=Summer 2017|title=The Beloved Disciple and the Spiritual Exercises|url=|journal=Studies in the Spirituality of Jesuits|volume=49| issue =  2|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===John the Baptist===\n{{Further information|John the Baptist}}\nJohn's account of the Baptist is different from that of the synoptic gospels. In this gospel, John is not called \"the Baptist.\"{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005}} The Baptist's ministry overlaps with [[Ministry of Jesus|that of Jesus]]; his [[baptism of Jesus]] is not explicitly mentioned, but his witness to Jesus is unambiguous.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005}} The evangelist almost certainly knew the story of John's baptism of Jesus and he makes a vital theological use of it.{{sfn|Barrett|1978|p=16}} He subordinates the Baptist to Jesus, perhaps in response to members of the Baptist's sect who regarded the Jesus movement as an offshoot of their movement.{{sfn|Harris|2006}}\n\nIn John's gospel, Jesus and his disciples go to Judea early in Jesus' ministry before John the Baptist was imprisoned and executed by Herod. He leads a ministry of baptism larger than John's own. The [[Jesus Seminar]] rated this account as black, containing no historically accurate information.{{sfn|Funk|Jesus Seminar|1998|pp=365\u2013440}} According to the biblical historians at the Jesus Seminar, John likely had a larger presence in the public mind than Jesus.{{sfn|Funk|Jesus Seminar|1998|p=268}}\n\n===Gnostic elements===\n{{Further information|Christian Gnosticism}}\nAlthough not commonly understood as [[Christian Gnosticism|Gnostic]], many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully argued that the Gospel of John has elements in common with [[Gnosticism]].{{sfn|Harris|2006}} Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it.{{sfn|Olson|1999|p=36}} To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it.{{sfn|Kysar|2005|pp=88ff}} Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. [[Raymond E. Brown]] have argued that the pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the [[Book of Proverbs]], and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by [[Philo Judaeus]].{{sfn|Brown|1997}}\n\nComparisons to Gnosticism are based not in what the author says, but in the language he uses to say it, notably, use of the concepts of Logos and Light.{{sfn|Van den Broek|Vermaseren|1981|pp=467ff}} Other scholars, e.g. [[Raymond E. Brown]], have argued that the ancient Jewish [[Qumran]] community also used the concept of Light versus Darkness.  The arguments of Bultmann and his school were seriously compromised by the mid-20th-century discoveries of the [[Nag Hammadi]] library of genuine Gnostic writings (which are dissimilar to the Gospel of John) as well as the [[Qumran]] library of Jewish writings (which are often similar to the Gospel of John).{{sfn|Combs|1987}}\n\nGnostics read John but interpreted it differently from the way non-Gnostics did.{{sfn|Most|2005|pp=121ff}} Gnosticism taught that salvation came from ''gnosis'', secret knowledge, and Gnostics did not see Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge.{{sfn|Skarsaune|2008|pp=247ff}} [[Barnabas Lindars]] asserts that the gospel teaches that salvation can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief ''into'') Jesus.{{sfn|Lindars|1990|p=62}}\n\nRaymond Brown contends that \"The Johannine picture of a savior who came from an alien world above, who said that neither he nor those who accepted him were of this world,<ref>{{Bibleref2|John|17:14|DRA}}</ref> and who promised to return to take them to a heavenly dwelling<ref>{{Bibleref2|John|14:2\u20133|DRA}}</ref> could be fitted into the gnostic world picture (even if God's love for the world in {{Bibleref2-nb|Jn|3:16|DRA}} could not).\"{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=375}} It has been suggested that similarities between John's gospel and Gnosticism may spring from common roots in Jewish [[Apocalyptic literature]].{{sfn|Kovacs|1995}}\n\n==Comparison with other writings==\nThe Gospel of John is significantly different from the [[synoptic Gospels|synoptic gospels]], with major variations in material, theological emphasis, chronology, and literary style.{{sfn|Burge|2014|pp=236\u201337}} There are also some discrepancies between John and the Synoptics, some amounting to contradictions.{{sfn|Burge|2014|pp=236\u201337}} The gospel forms the core of an emerging canon of Johannine works, the Johannine corpus, consisting of the gospel, the three Johannine letters, and the Apocalypse, all coming from the same theological background and opposed to the \"Petrine corpus.\"\n\n=== Material ===\nJohn lacks scenes from the Synoptics such as Jesus' baptism,{{sfn|Funk|Hoover|Jesus Seminar|1993|pp=1\u201330}} the calling of the Twelve, exorcisms, parables, the Transfiguration, and the Last Supper. Conversely, it includes scenes not found in the Synoptics, including Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at Cana, the resurrection of Lazarus, Jesus washing the feet of his disciples, and multiple visits to Jerusalem.{{sfn|Burge|2014|pp=236\u201337}}\n\nIn the fourth gospel, Jesus' mother [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], while frequently mentioned, is never identified by name.{{sfn|Williamson|2004|p=265}}{{sfn|Michaels|1971|p=733}} John does assert that Jesus was known as the \"son of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]\" in {{Bibleref2|John|6:42|DRA|6:42}}. For John, Jesus' town of origin is irrelevant, for he comes from beyond this world, from [[God the Father]].{{sfn|Fredriksen|2008}}\n\nWhile John makes no direct mention of Jesus' baptism,{{sfn|Funk|Hoover|Jesus Seminar|1993|pp=1\u201330}}{{sfn|Burge|2014|pp=236\u201337}} he does quote [[John the Baptist]]'s description of the descent of the Holy Spirit as a [[dove]], as happens at Jesus' baptism in the Synoptics. Major synoptic speeches of Jesus are absent, including the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Olivet Discourse]],{{sfn|Pagels|2003}} and the [[Miracles of Jesus|exorcisms of demons]] are never mentioned as in the Synoptics.{{sfn|Funk|Hoover|Jesus Seminar|1993|pp=1\u201330}}{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=184}} John never lists all of the [[Twelve Disciples]] and names at least one disciple, [[Nathanael (follower of Jesus)|Nathanael]], whose name is not found in the Synoptics. [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]] is given a personality beyond a mere name, described as \"[[Doubting Thomas]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walvoord|first1=John F.|title=The Bible Knowledge Commentary|date=1985|publisher=Victor Books|location=Wheaton, IL|page=313}}</ref>\n\n=== Theological emphasis ===\nJesus is identified with the Word (\"[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]\"), and the Word is identified with ''theos'' (\"god\" in Greek);{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} no such identification is made in the Synoptics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=D. A.|title=The Pillar New Testament Commentary: The Gospel According to John|date=1991|publisher=Wm. B. Eardmans Publishing Co.|location=Grand Rapids, MI|page=117}}</ref> In Mark, Jesus urges his disciples to keep his divinity secret, but in John he is very open in discussing it, even referring to himself as \"I AM\", the title God gives himself in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] at his self-revelation to [[Moses]]. In the Synoptics, the chief theme is the [[Kingdom of God (Christianity)|Kingdom of God]] and the [[Kingdom of Heaven (Gospel of Matthew)|Kingdom of Heaven]] (the latter specifically in Matthew), while John's theme is Jesus as the source of eternal life and the Kingdom is only mentioned twice.{{sfn|Burge|2014|pp=236\u201337}}{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=184}} In contrast to the synoptic expectation of the Kingdom (using the term ''[[parousia]]'', meaning \"coming\"), John presents a more individualistic, [[realized eschatology]].{{Sfn|Moule|1962|pp=172\u201374}}{{sfn|Sander|2015}}{{Refn|''Realized eschatology'' is a [[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatological]] theory popularized by [[C. H. Dodd]] (1884\u20131973). It holds that the eschatological passages in the [[New Testament]] do not refer to future events, but instead to the [[ministry of Jesus]] and his lasting legacy.{{sfn|Ladd|Hagner|1993|p=56}} In other words, it holds that Christian eschatological expectations have already been realized or fulfilled.|group=Notes}}\n\n=== Chronology ===\nIn the Synoptics, the ministry of Jesus takes a single year, but in John it takes three, as evidenced by references to three Passovers. Events are not all in the same order: the date of the crucifixion is different, as is the time of Jesus' anointing in Bethany and the cleansing of the temple occurs in the beginning of Jesus' ministry rather than near its end.{{sfn|Burge|2014|pp=236\u201337}}\n\n=== Literary style ===\nIn the Synoptics, quotations from Jesus are usually in the form of short, pithy sayings; in John, longer quotations are often given. The vocabulary is also different, and filled with theological import: in John, Jesus does not work \"miracles\" ({{lang-el|\u03b4\u1fe0\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2|translit=dyn\u00e1meis}}, sing. {{lang|el|\u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u1fb0\u03bc\u1fd0\u03c2}}, ''{{transl|el|d\u00fdnamis}}''), but \"signs\" ({{lang-el|\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u1fb0|translit=s\u0113meia|link=no}}, sing. {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd}}, ''{{transl|el|s\u0113meion}}'') which unveil his divine identity.{{sfn|Burge|2014|pp=236\u201337}} Most scholars consider John not to contain any [[parable]]s.{{sfn|Barry|1911}} Rather it contains [[metaphor]]ical stories or [[allegories]], such as those of the [[Good Shepherd]] and of the [[True Vine]], in which each individual element corresponds to a specific person, group, or thing. Some scholars, however, find some such parables as the short story of the childbearing woman ({{Bibleref2|John|16:21|DRA|16:21}}) or the dying grain ({{Bibleref2|John|12:24|DRA|12:24}}).{{refn|group=Notes|See {{harvnb|Zimmermann|2015|pp=333\u201360}}.}}\n\n=== Discrepancies ===\nAccording to the Synoptics, the arrest of Jesus was a reaction to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus.{{sfn|Burge|2014|pp=236\u201337}} The [[Pharisees]], portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they [[debate]] frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as [[Nicodemus]], even go so far as to be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.{{sfn|Neusner|2003|p=8}}\n\n===Historical reliability===\n{{Further information|Historicity of the Bible}}\nThe teachings of Jesus found in the synoptic gospels are very different from those recorded in John, and since the 19th century scholars have almost unanimously accepted that these Johannine discourses are less likely than the synoptic parables to be historical, and were likely written for theological purposes.{{sfn|Sanders|1995|pp=57, 70\u201371}} By the same token, scholars usually agree that John is not entirely without historical value: certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts, his representation of the topography around [[Jerusalem]] is often superior to that of the synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=36\u201337}}\n\n==Representations==\n[[File:The last chapter by J.

His crusade for political reform and [[fiscal conservatism]] made him an icon for American conservatives of the era.<ref>Blum, 527</ref> Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of [[classical liberalism]].<ref>Jeffers, 8\u201312; Nevins, 4\u20135; Beito and Beito</ref> He fought political corruption, patronage, and [[Political boss|bossism]]. As a reformer, Cleveland had such prestige that the like-minded wing of the Republican Party, called \"[[Mugwump]]s\", largely bolted the GOP presidential ticket and swung to his support in the 1884 election.<ref>McFarland, 11\u201356</ref>\n\nAs his second administration began, disaster hit the nation when the [[Panic of 1893]] produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland was unable to reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening the way for a [[United States House elections, 1894|Republican landslide in 1894]] and for the agrarian and [[silverite]] seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a [[realigning election|political realignment]] that ended the [[Third Party System]] and launched the [[Fourth Party System]] and the [[Progressive Era]].<ref>Gould, ''passim''</ref>\n\nCleveland was a formidable policymaker, and he also drew corresponding criticism. His intervention in the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois; his support of the [[gold standard]] and opposition to Free Silver alienated the [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] wing of the Democratic Party.<ref name=tugwell>Tugwell, 220\u2013249</ref> Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters\u2014[[Depression (economics)|depressions]] and strikes\u2014in his second term.<ref name=tugwell/> Even so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer [[Allan Nevins]] wrote, \"[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not.\"<ref>Nevins, 4</ref> By the end of his second term, public perception showed him to be one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents, and was by then rejected even by most Democrats.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CnIhCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=grover+cleveland+extremely+unpopular+after+second+term&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb89LlttDZAhUHZKwKHcXpDXQQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=grover%20cleveland%20extremely%20unpopular%20after%20second%20term&f=false President-Making in the Gilded Age]: The Nominating Conventions of 1876\u20131900 by Stan M.

On his mother's side, Cleveland was descended from [[Anglo-Irish]] Protestants and [[German Americans|German]] [[Quaker]]s from Philadelphia.<ref>Nevins, 9</ref> Cleveland was distantly related to General [[Moses Cleaveland]], after whom the city of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], was named.<ref>Graff, 7</ref>\n\nCleveland, the fifth of nine children, was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell, where his father was pastor at the time. He became known as Grover in his adult life.<ref>Nevins, 10; Graff, 3</ref> In 1841, the Cleveland family moved to [[Fayetteville, New York]], where Grover spent much of his childhood.<ref>Nevins, 11; Graff, 8\u20139</ref> Neighbors later described him as \"full of fun and inclined to play pranks,\"<ref>Nevins, 11</ref> and fond of outdoor sports.<ref>Jeffers, 17</ref>\n\nIn 1850, Cleveland's father moved to [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York]], to work as district secretary for the [[American Home Missionary Society]].<ref>Nevins, 17\u201319</ref> Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling at the completion of the apprentice contract.<ref>Tugwell, 14</ref> In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in [[Holland Patent, New York]] (near [[Utica, New York|Utica]]) and the family moved again.<ref name=nevins21>Nevins, 21</ref> Shortly after, he died from a [[gastric ulcer]], with Grover reputedly hearing of his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.<ref name=nevins21/>\n\n===Education and moving west===\n[[Image:PCLEV001-009.jpg|thumb|upright|An early, undated photograph of Grover Cleveland]]\nCleveland received his elementary education at the Fayetteville Academy and the Clinton Liberal Academy.<ref>Nevins, 18\u201319; Jeffers, 19</ref> After his father died in 1853, he again left school to help support his family. Later that year, Cleveland's brother William was hired as a teacher at the [[New York Institute for the Blind]] in New York City, and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher. He returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854, where an elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister. Cleveland declined, and in 1855 he decided to move west.<ref name=nevins27>Nevins, 23\u201327</ref> He stopped first in [[Buffalo, New York]], where his uncle, [[Lewis F. Allen]], gave him a clerical job.<ref>Nevins, 27\u201333</ref> Allen was an important man in Buffalo, and he introduced his nephew to influential men there, including the partners in the [[law firm]] of Rogers, Bowen, and Rogers.<ref>Nevins, 31\u201336</ref> [[Millard Fillmore]], the 13th president of the United States, had previously worked for the partnership.<ref>Graff, 11</ref> Cleveland later took a clerkship with the firm, began to [[read the law]], and was [[Admission to practice law|admitted]] to the New York bar in 1859.<ref name=graff14>Graff, 14</ref>\n\n===Early career and the Civil War===\nCleveland worked for the Rogers firm for three years, then left in 1862 to start his own practice.<ref>Graff, 14\u201315</ref> In January 1863, he was appointed assistant [[district attorney]] of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]].<ref>Graff, 15; Nevins, 46</ref> With the [[American Civil War]] raging, Congress passed the [[Conscription Act of 1863]], requiring able-bodied men to serve in the army if called upon, or else to hire a substitute.<ref name=graff14/> Cleveland chose the latter course, paying $150 ({{Inflation|US|150|1863|fmt=eq}}) to George Benninsky, a thirty-two-year-old [[Poles|Polish]] immigrant, to serve in his place.<ref>Graff, 14; Nevins, 51\u201352.

Bass]], the Republican nominee.<ref name=nevins52/> In 1870, with the help of friend Oscar Folsom, Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination for [[Sheriff of Erie County, New York]].<ref name=nevins58>Nevins, 58</ref> He won the election by a 303-vote margin and took office on January 1, 1871 at age 33.<ref>Jeffers, 33</ref> While this new career took him away from the practice of law, it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to yield up to $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40000|1871|fmt=eq}}) over the two-year term.<ref name=nevins58/>\n\nCleveland's service as sheriff was unremarkable; biographer [[Rexford Tugwell]] described the time in office as a waste for Cleveland politically. Cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriff's office during his tenure and chose not to confront it.<ref>Tugwell, 36</ref> A notable incident of his term took place on September 6, 1872, when Patrick Morrissey was executed, who had been convicted of murdering his mother.<ref name=morrisey>Jeffers, 34; Nevins, 61\u201362</ref> As sheriff, Cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy $10 to perform the task.<ref name=morrisey/> In spite of reservations about the hanging, Cleveland executed Morrissey himself;<ref name=morrisey/> he hanged another murderer, [[List of individuals executed in New York|John Gaffney]], on February 14, 1873.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonian.com/history/articles/1851-1900/gaffneyhanging/gaffneyhanging.html|title=The Execution of John Gaffney|accessdate=March 27, 2008|website=The Buffalonian|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006162510/http://www.buffalonian.com/history/articles/1851-1900/gaffneyhanging/gaffneyhanging.html|archivedate=October 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter his term as sheriff ended, Cleveland returned to his law practice, opening a firm with his friends Lyman K.

As biographer [[Allan Nevins]] wrote, \"Probably no man in the country, on March 4, 1881, had less thought than this limited, simple, sturdy attorney of Buffalo that four years later he would be standing in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and taking the oath as President of the United States.\"<ref>Nevins, 78</ref>\n\nIt was during this period that Cleveland began a relationship with a widow, [[Maria Crofts Halpin]].

His veto message said, \"I regard it as the culmination of a most bare-faced, impudent, and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people, and to worse than squander the public money.\"<ref>Nevins, 85</ref> The Council reversed itself and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder.<ref>Nevins, 86</ref> Cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a Commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in Buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally; this plan was successfully adopted.<ref>Tugwell, 58</ref> For this, and other actions safeguarding public funds, Cleveland's reputation as a leader willing to purge government corruption began to spread beyond Erie County.<ref>Nevins, 94\u201395; Jeffers, 50\u201351</ref>\n\n===Governor of New York===\n[[File:GCleveland.png|thumb|left|Gubernatorial portrait of Grover Cleveland]]\nNew York Democratic party officials began to consider Cleveland a possible nominee for governor.<ref name=nevins94>Nevins, 94\u201399; Graff, 26\u201327</ref> [[Daniel Manning]], a party insider who admired Cleveland's record, was instrumental in his candidacy.<ref>Tugwell, 68\u201370</ref> With a split in the state Republican party in 1882, the Democratic party was considered to be at an advantage; there were several contenders for that party's nomination.<ref name=nevins94/> The two leading Democratic candidates were [[Roswell P.

Thurman]] of [[Ohio]], [[Samuel Freeman Miller]] of [[Iowa]], and [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] of [[Massachusetts]] also had considerable followings, along with various [[favorite son]]s.<ref name=nevins146/> Each of the other candidates had hindrances to his nomination: Bayard had spoken in favor of [[secession]] in 1861, making him unacceptable to Northerners; Butler, conversely, was reviled throughout the South for his actions during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]; Thurman was generally well liked, but was growing old and infirm, and his views on the [[Bimetallism|silver question]] were uncertain.<ref>Nevins, 147</ref> Cleveland, too, had detractors\u2014Tammany remained opposed to him\u2014but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends.<ref>Nevins, 152\u2013153; Graff, 51\u201353</ref> Cleveland led on the first ballot, with 392 votes out of 820.<ref>Nevins, 153</ref> On the second ballot, Tammany threw its support behind Butler, but the rest of the delegates shifted to Cleveland, who won.<ref name=nevins154>Nevins, 154; Graff, 53\u201354</ref> [[Thomas A.

They also blistered Blaine for attending a banquet with some of New York City's wealthiest men.<ref>Tugwell, 94\u201395</ref>\n\nAfter the votes were counted, Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by 1200 votes.<ref name=leip1884>{{Leip PV source 2|year=1884| as of=January 27, 2008}}, {{National Archives EV source|year=1888| as of=January 27, 2008}}</ref> While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219\u2013182.<ref name=leip1884/> Following the electoral victory, the \"Ma, Ma&nbsp;...\" attack phrase gained a classic riposte: \"Gone to the White House.

These jobs were typically filled under the [[spoils system]], but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone solely on the basis of party service.<ref>Nevins, 208\u2013211</ref> He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers.<ref>Nevins, 214\u2013217</ref> Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats;<ref>Graff, 83</ref> this was especially the case with policy making positions.<ref>Tugwell, 100</ref> While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.<ref>Nevins, 238\u2013241; Welch, 59\u201360</ref>\n\nCleveland also reformed other parts of the government. In 1887, he signed an act creating the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]].<ref>Nevins, 354\u2013357; Graff, 85</ref> He and [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[William C.

In his veto message, he espoused a theory of limited government:\n{{quote|I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution, and I do not believe that the power and duty of the general government ought to be extended to the relief of individual suffering which is in no manner properly related to the public service or benefit.

The friendliness and charity of our countrymen can always be relied upon to relieve their fellow-citizens in misfortune. This has been repeatedly and quite lately demonstrated. Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character, while it prevents the indulgence among our people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which strengthens the bonds of a common brotherhood.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Writings and Speeches of Grover Cleveland |publisher=Cassell Publishing Co |year=1892 |location=New York |page=450 |chapter=Cleveland's Veto of the Texas Seed Bill |chapterurl=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Cleveland's_Veto_of_the_Texas_Seed_Bill |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:Writings_and_Speeches_of_Grover_Cleveland.djvu |isbn=0-217-89899-8}}</ref>}}\n\n===Silver===\nOne of the most volatile issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by [[Bimetallism|gold and silver]], or by [[gold standard|gold alone]].<ref>Jeffers, 157\u2013158</ref> The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard.<ref name=nevins201>Nevins, 201\u2013205; Graff, 102\u2013103</ref> Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.<ref name=nevins201/>\n\nCleveland and Treasury Secretary [[Daniel Manning]] stood firmly on the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the government was required to coin under the [[Bland-Allison Act]] of 1878.<ref>Nevins, 269</ref> Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated.<ref>Tugwell, 110</ref> Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents.<ref>Nevins, 268</ref> In reply, one of the foremost silverites, [[Richard P.

Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.\n\n===Foreign policy, 1885\u20131889===\nCleveland was a committed non-interventionist who had campaigned in opposition to expansion and imperialism. He refused to promote the previous administration's [[Nicaragua]] canal treaty, and generally was less of an expansionist in foreign relations.<ref>Nevins, 205, 404\u2013405</ref> Cleveland's Secretary of State, [[Thomas F.

The first, [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II|Lucius Q.C. Lamar]], was a former [[Mississippi]] Senator who served in Cleveland's Cabinet as Interior Secretary. When [[William Burnham Woods]] died, Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887. While Lamar had been well liked as a Senator, his service under the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] two decades earlier caused many Republicans to vote against him. Lamar's nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28.<ref>Daniel J. Meador, \"Lamar to the Court: Last Step to National Reunion\" ''Supreme Court Historical Society Yearbook 1986'': 27\u201347. {{ISSN|0362-5249}}</ref>\n\n[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Morrison Waite]] died a few months later, and Cleveland nominated [[Melville Fuller]] to fill his seat on April 30, 1888. Fuller accepted. He had previously declined Cleveland's nomination to the [[Civil Service Commission]], preferring his Chicago law practice. The [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] spent several months examining the little-known nominee, before the Senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20.<ref>Willard L. King, ''Melville Weston Fuller \u2013 Chief Justice of the United States 1888\u20131910'' (1950)</ref><ref name=nevins445>Nevins, 445\u2013450</ref>\n\nCleveland nominated 41 lower federal court judges in addition to his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the [[United States circuit court]]s, nine judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]], and 30 judges to the [[United States district courts]]. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office at the time that the change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.\n\n==Election of 1888 and return to private life==\n\n===Defeated by Harrison===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1888|Grover Cleveland Presidential campaign, 1888}}\n[[Image:Cleveland-Thurman.jpg|thumb|right|Cleveland\u2013Thurman campaign poster]]\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1888.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Results of the 1888 Election]]\nThe Republicans nominated [[Benjamin Harrison]] of [[Indiana]] for president and [[Levi P.

Hill]], weakening Cleveland's support in that swing state.<ref>Nevins, 423\u2013427</ref> A [[Murchison letter|letter from the British ambassador]] supporting Cleveland caused a scandal which cost Cleveland votes in New York.\n\nAs in 1884, the election focused on the swing states of New York, [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]], and [[Indiana]]. But unlike that year, when Cleveland had triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing his home state of New York by 14,373 votes.<ref name=leip1888>{{Leip PV source 2|year=1888| as of=February 18, 2008}}, {{National Archives EV source|year=1888| as of=February 18, 2008}}</ref> The Republicans won Indiana, largely as the result of a fraudulent voting practice known as [[Blocks of Five]].<ref>Nevins, 435\u2013439; Jeffers, 220\u2013222</ref> Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life.<ref>Nevins, 443\u2013449</ref>\n\n===Private citizen for four years===\nAs Frances Cleveland left the White House, she told a staff member, \"Now, Jerry, I want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again.\" When asked when she would return, she responded, \"We are coming back four years from today.\"<ref>Nevins, 448</ref> In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City, where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, [[Francis Lynde Stetson|Stetson]], Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office-sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home [[Gray Gables]] at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession.<ref>Tugwell, 175</ref> While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.<ref>Nevins, 450; Graff, 99\u2013100</ref>\n\nThe Harrison administration worked with Congress to pass the [[McKinley Tariff]], an aggressively protectionist measure and the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], which increased money backed by silver;<ref>Tugwell, 168</ref> these were among policies Cleveland deplored as dangerous to the nation's financial health.<ref>Graff, 102\u2013105; Nevins, 465\u2013467</ref> At first he refrained from criticizing his successor, but by 1891 Cleveland felt compelled to speak out, addressing his concerns in an open letter to a meeting of reformers in New York.<ref>Graff, 104\u2013105; Nevins, 467\u2013468</ref> The \"silver letter\" thrust Cleveland's name back into the spotlight just as the 1892 election was approaching.<ref>Nevins, 470\u2013471</ref>\n\n==Election of 1892==\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1892|Grover Cleveland Presidential campaign, 1892}}\n\n===Democratic nomination===\nCleveland's enduring reputation as chief executive and his recent pronouncements on the monetary issues made him a leading contender for the Democratic nomination.<ref>Nevins, 468\u2013469</ref> His leading opponent was [[David B.

Unlike the turbulent and controversial elections of 1876, 1884, and 1888, the 1892 election was, according to Cleveland biographer [[Allan Nevins]], \"the cleanest, quietest, and most creditable in the memory of the post-war generation,\"<ref>Nevins, 498</ref> in part because Harrison's wife, Caroline, was dying of tuberculosis.<ref>Calhoun, 149</ref> Harrison did not personally campaign at all. Following Caroline Harrison's death on October 25, two weeks before the national election, Cleveland and all of the other candidates stopped campaigning, thus making Election Day a somber and quiet event for the whole country as well as the candidates.\n\nThe issue of the tariff worked to the Republicans' advantage in 1888. The legislative revisions of the past four years also made imported goods so expensive that now many voters favored tariff reform and were skeptical of big business.<ref>Nevins, 499</ref> Many Westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to [[James B.

The [[Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act]] was introduced by West Virginian Representative [[William Lyne Wilson|William L. Wilson]] in December 1893.<ref>Festus P. Summers, ''William L. Wilson and Tariff Reform: A Biography'' (1974)</ref> After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin.<ref>Nevins, 567; the vote was 204 to 140</ref> The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials.<ref name=nevins564>Nevins, 564\u2013566; Jeffers, 285\u2013287</ref> The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an [[income tax]] of two percent on income above $4,000 ({{Inflation|US|4000|1893|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=nevins564/>\n\nThe bill was next considered in the Senate, where it faced stronger opposition from key Democrats led by [[Arthur Pue Gorman]] of Maryland, who insisted on more protection for their states' industries than the Wilson bill allowed.<ref>Lambert, 213\u201315</ref> The bill passed the Senate with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms.<ref>The income tax component of the Wilson-Gorman Act was partially ruled unconstitutional in 1895. ''See [[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]''</ref> The [[American Sugar Refining Company|Sugar Trust]] in particular lobbied for changes that favored it at the expense of the consumer.<ref>Nevins, 577\u2013578</ref> Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests.<ref name=nevins585>Nevins, 585\u2013587; Jeffers, 288\u2013289</ref> Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.<ref name=nevins564a>Nevins, 564\u2013588; Jeffers, 285\u2013289</ref>\n\n===Voting rights===\nIn 1892, Cleveland had campaigned against the [[Lodge Bill]],<ref>James B. Hedges (1940), \"North America\", in [[William L. Langer]], ed., ''An Encyclopedia of World History'', Boston:  Houghton Mifflin, Part V, Section G, Subsection 1c, p. 794.</ref> which would have strengthened [[voting rights in the United States|voting rights protections]] through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The [[Enforcement Act of 1871]] had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36).<ref>Congressional Research Service (2004), ''The Constitution of the United States:  Analysis and Interpretation\u2014Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002'', Washington: Government Printing Office, \"Fifteenth Amendment\", \"Congressional Enforcement\", \"Federal Remedial Legislation\", p. 2058.</ref> The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'', 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and ''Giles v. Teasley'', 193 U.S. 146 (1904).\n\n===Labor unrest===\n[[File:John t morgan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Tyler Morgan|John T.

A strike began against the [[Pullman Company]] over low wages and twelve-hour workdays, and sympathy strikes, led by [[American Railway Union]] leader [[Eugene V. Debs]], soon followed.<ref>Nevins, 611\u2013613</ref> By June 1894, 125,000 railroad workers were on strike, paralyzing the nation's commerce.<ref>Nevins, 614</ref> Because the railroads carried the [[U.S. Postal Service|mail]], and because several of the affected lines were in [[Bankruptcy in the United States|federal receivership]], Cleveland believed a federal solution was appropriate.<ref>Nevins, 614\u2013618; Graff, 118\u2013119; Jeffers, 296\u2013297</ref> Cleveland obtained an injunction in federal court, and when the strikers refused to obey it, he sent federal troops into Chicago and 20 other rail centers.<ref>Nevins, 619\u2013623; Jeffers, 298\u2013302. See also ''[[In re Debs]]''.</ref> \"If it takes the entire army and navy of the United States to deliver a postcard in Chicago\", he proclaimed, \"that card will be delivered.\"<ref>Nevins, 628</ref> Most governors supported Cleveland except Democrat [[John P. Altgeld]] of Illinois, who became his bitter foe in 1896. Leading newspapers of both parties applauded Cleveland's actions, but the use of troops hardened the attitude of organized labor toward his administration.<ref>Nevins, 624\u2013628; Jeffers, 304\u2013305; Graff, 120</ref>\n\nJust before the 1894 election, Cleveland was warned by Francis Lynde Stetson, an advisor:\n:\"We are on the eve of [a] very dark night, unless a return of commercial prosperity relieves popular discontent with what they believe [is] Democratic incompetence to make laws, and consequently [discontent] with Democratic Administrations anywhere and everywhere.\"<ref>Francis Lynde Stetson to Cleveland, October 7, 1894 in Allan Nevins, ed. ''Letters of Grover Cleveland, 1850\u20131908'' (1933) p. 369</ref>\n\nThe warning was appropriate, for in the Congressional elections, Republicans won their biggest landslide in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts were two of the few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for president.<ref>[[Richard J.

He was born<ref name=Chambers>\"Allegri, Gregorio\" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclop\u00e6dia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 271.</ref> and died in [[Rome]].\n\n==Life==\nHe studied music as a ''puer'' (boy chorister) at [[San Luigi dei Francesi]], under the ''maestro di capella'' [[Giovanni Bernardino Nanino]], brother of [[Giovanni Maria Nanino]]. Being intended for the Church, he obtained a benefice in the cathedral of [[Fermo]]. Here he composed a large number of [[motet]]s and other sacred music, which, being brought to the notice of [[Pope Urban VIII]], obtained for him an appointment in the choir of the [[Sistine Chapel]] at Rome as a [[contralto]]. He held this from 6 December 1629 until his death. As [[Andrea Adami da Bolsena|Andrea Adami]] wrote, Allegri was regarded as singularly pure and benevolent.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Allegri, Gregorio|volume=1|page=690}}</ref><ref>\"In addition to his virtue, he had singularly good nature. He gave generous alms to the poor, who were always on his doorstep, as well as to prisoners, whom he visited daily, as I was assured by one of his pupils, a man worthy of belief, who is still alive.\" (''Era anco aggiunta alla sua virt\u00f9 una singolar bont\u00e0 di costumi. Tanto a i poveri, che aveva sempre alla sua porta di Casa, quanto a i carcerati, che quotidianamente visitava, faceva larghe limosine, come mi ha attestato un suo scolare ancor vivente Uomo degno d'ogni credito''), Andrea Adami, ''Osservazioni per ben regolare il coro della cappella pontificia'', Antonio de' Rossi, Roma, 1711, pp. 199\u2013200.</ref>\n\nAmong Allegri's musical compositions were two volumes of concerti for five voices published in 1618 and 1619; two volumes of motets for six voices published in 1621; an edition of a four-part [[sinfonia]]; five [[mass (music)|masses]]; two settings of the ''[[Lamentations of Jeremiah]]''; and numerous motets which were not published in his lifetime. He was one of the earliest composers for [[string instrument|stringed instruments]], and [[Athanasius Kircher]] has given one specimen of this class of his works in his ''Musurgia''.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Most of Allegri's published music, especially the instrumental music, is in the progressive early Baroque [[concertato]] style. However, his work for the Sistine Chapel is descended from the [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] style, and in some cases strips even this refined, simple style of almost all localised ornamentation. He is credited with the earliest [[string quartet]].\n\n==The ''Miserere''==\n{{Main|Miserere (Allegri)}}\nBy far the best-known and regarded piece of music composed by Allegri is the ''[[Miserere (Allegri)|Miserere mei, Deus]]'', a setting of Vulgate Psalm 50 (= Psalm 51). It is written for two [[choir]]s, the one of five and the other of four voices, and has obtained considerable celebrity. One of the choirs sings a simple ''[[fauxbordon]]'' based on the original [[plainsong]] chant for the ''[[Tonus peregrinus]]''; the other choir sings a similar ''fauxbordon'' with pre-existing elaborations and the use of cadenzas. The ''Miserere'' has for many years been sung annually during [[Holy Week]] in the Sistine Chapel. Many have cited this work as an example of the ''[[stile antico]]'' (old style) or ''[[prima pratica]]'' (first practice). However, its emphasis on [[polychoral]] techniques certainly put it out of the range of ''prima pratica.'' A more accurate comparison would be to the works of [[Giovanni Gabrieli]].\n\nThe ''Miserere'' is one of the most often-recorded examples of late Renaissance music, although it was actually written during the chronological confines of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era; in this regard it is representative of the music of the Roman School of composers, who were stylistically conservative. The work acquired a considerable reputation for mystery and inaccessibility between the time of its composition and the era of modern recording; the Vatican, wanting to preserve its aura of mystery, forbade copies, threatening any publication or attempted copy with excommunication. They were not prepared, however, for a special visit in 1770 from a 14-year-old named [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], who, on a trip to Rome with his father, heard it but twice and transcribed it faithfully from memory, thus creating the first known unauthorised copy.<ref>For new information on this episode, see Ilias Chrissochoidis, [https://www.academia.edu/249273/ \"London Mozartiana: Wolfgang's disputed age & early performances of Allegri's ''Miserere''\",] ''The Musical Times'', vol. 151, no. 1911 (Summer 2010), 83\u201389.</ref>\n\nIn 1771 Mozart's copy was procured and published in England by the famous traveler and music historian [[Dr. Burney]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} However, Burney's edition does not show the ornamentation for which the work was famous. The music itself is rather basic\u2014church music at the time placed a large gap between written and performance practice\u2014embellishments were largely placed in the hands of the performers' tastes, although the Vatican score itself was altered largely by performers and visitors over the years.\n\nThe music as it is performed today includes a strange error by a copyist in the 1880s. The curious \"trucker's gear change\" from G minor to C minor is because the second half of the verse is the same as the first half, but transposed up a fourth. The original never had a Top C.<ref>ed. Rutter, J. European Sacred Music. OUP 1996</ref>\n\nThe entire music performed at Rome in [[Holy Week]], Allegri's ''Miserere'' included, has been issued at [[Leipzig]] by [[Breitkopf and Hartel|Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel]]. Interesting accounts of the impression produced by the performance at [[Rome]] may be found in the first volume of [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s letters and in Miss Taylor's ''Letters from Italy''.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ancientgroove.co.uk/essays/allegri.html A Biography and detailed essay on his \"Miserere mei\"]\n*[http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/allegri/miserere.html Article on Gregorio Allegri's ''Misere''] on [http://www.classical.net/music/welcome.html ClassicalNet]\n*{{IMSLP|id=Allegri%2C_Gregorio}}\n*{{ChoralWiki}}\n\n{{Roman School}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Allegri, Gregorio}}\n[[Category:Italian classical composers]]\n[[Category:Italian male classical composers]]\n[[Category:Italian Baroque composers]]\n[[Category:17th-century classical composers]]\n[[Category:Italian Roman Catholic priests]]\n[[Category:Pupils of Giovanni Maria Nanino]]\n[[Category:Roman school composers]]\n[[Category:Renaissance composers]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Rome]]\n[[Category:1582 births]]\n[[Category:1652 deaths]]", "sha1": "dfj5i80tmxbugzv6h9nn5sutbpje9hf"}}, {"title": "Goodness (band)", "ns": "0", "id": "12500", "revision": {"id": "822830232", "parentid": "822419590", "timestamp": "2018-01-28T19:21:54Z", "contributor": {"username": "G\u00fcnniX", "id": "237572"}, "minor": "", "comment": "References", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n| name                = Goodness\n| image               = Goodness Lava Atlantic.jpg\n| caption             = Goodness, 1995\n| background          = group_or_band\n| origin              = [[Seattle, Washington]], United States\n| genre               = [[Alternative rock]], [[indie rock]]\n| years_active        = {{start date|1994}}-{{end date|2005}}\n| associated_acts     = [[Hammerbox]], [[The Rockfords]], [[Pearl Jam]]\n| past_members     = [[Carrie Akre]]<br />Garth Reeves<br />Danny Newcomb<br />Fiia McGann<br />Chris Friel\n}}\n'''Goodness''' was an American rock band from [[Seattle, Washington]], led by [[Carrie Akre]], formerly of [[Hammerbox]] and now primarily a solo artist.

A [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], he remains the only man to score a hat-trick in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] final, when [[England national football team|England]] recorded a [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|4\u20132 victory]] over [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] at the old [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]].\n\nHurst began his career with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], where he scored 242 goals in 500 first team appearances. There he won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1964 FA Cup Final|1964]] and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1965 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1965]]. He was sold to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 1972 for \u00a380,000. After three seasons with Stoke he finished his [[The Football League|Football League]] career with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in 1976. Hurst went to play football in Ireland ([[Cork Celtic F.C.|Cork Celtic]]) and the USA ([[Seattle Sounders (1974\u20131983)|Seattle Sounders]]) before returning to England to manage non-league [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]]. He also coached in the England set-up before an unsuccessful stint as [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] manager from 1979 to 1981. He later coached [[Kuwait SC]] before leaving the game to concentrate on his business commitments.\n\nIn total he scored 24 goals in 49 England appearances, and as well as success in the 1966 World Cup he also appeared at [[UEFA Euro 1968]] and the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. He also had a brief [[cricket]] career, making one [[First-class cricket|First-class]] appearance for [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] in 1962, before concentrating on football.\n\n==Early life==\nHurst was born in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], [[Lancashire]], on 8 December 1941.<ref name=\"page 24\">{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=24}}</ref> He had two younger siblings: Diane and Robert.<ref name=\"page 24\"/> His family moved to [[Chelmsford]], [[Essex]] when he was six years old.<ref name=\"page 24\"/> His father, [[Charlie Hurst]], was a professional footballer who played at centre-half for [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=22}}</ref> His mother, Evelyn Hopkins, was from a [[Gloucestershire]] family with her mother's side originally from Germany.<ref>http://www.ancestry{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=23}}</ref> As a teenager he was obsessed with football, and was once fined \u00a31 for disturbing the peace after consistently kicking a football into his neighbour's garden.<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=26}}</ref>\n\nHurst played one [[first-class cricket]] match for [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/14322.html |title=Geoff Hurst player profile |publisher=Cricinfo.com}} Retrieved on 12&nbsp;September 2008.</ref> against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] at [[Aigburth]] in 1962, although it was not a successful outing: he made 0 [[not out]] in the first [[innings]], and was [[bowled]] by Colin Hilton, again for 0, in the second.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acscricket.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25458.html |title=Lancashire v Essex, County Championship 1962 |publisher=CricketArchive.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210023255/http://acscricket.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25458.html |archivedate=10 February 2009 |df=dmy }} Retrieved on 12&nbsp;September 2008.</ref> However, he appeared 23 times in the Essex Second XI between 1962 and 1964, usually as a wicketkeeper, before concentrating entirely on football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acscricket.com/Archive/Players/4/4915/Second_Eleven_Championship_Matches.html |title=Second Eleven Championship Matches played by Geoff Hurst (23) |publisher=CricketArchive.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210155741/http://acscricket.com/Archive/Players/4/4915/Second_Eleven_Championship_Matches.html |archivedate=10 February 2009 |df=dmy }} Retrieved on 12&nbsp;September 2008.</ref>\n\nUnder his father\u2019s management of the club, Hurst played once for [[Halstead Town F.C.|Halstead Town]] reserves at the age of \"about 14\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonleaguedaily.com/news/index.php?&newsmode=FULL&nid=10155|title=HURST WILL BE ROOTING FOR A SUDBURY WIN|date=2003-05-10|accessdate=3 July 2018|publisher=Non League Daily|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001022639/http://www.nonleaguedaily.com/news/index.php?&newsmode=FULL&nid=10155|archivedate=1 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n\n===West Ham United===\nHurst's football career began when he was [[Apprenticeship|apprenticed]] to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] at the age of 15.<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=28}}</ref> Manager [[Ted Fenton]] first selected him for a senior game in a [[Southern Professional Floodlit Cup|Southern Floodlit Cup]] tie with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in December 1958.<ref name=\"page 31\">{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=31}}</ref> He turned professional at the club four months later, and was paid \u00a37 a week with a \u00a320 signing on fee.<ref name=\"page 31\"/> His first competitive appearance came in February 1960 when injuries forced Fenton's hand;

He was the team's second-leading scorer, helping the Sounders make it to the play-offs for the first time in their brief history, with eight goals and four assists in 23 regular season games, and one goal in the play-offs.\n\n==International career==\n\n===1966 World Cup===\nHurst made his senior [[England national football team|England]] debut against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] on 23 February 1966.<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=419}}</ref> He played well, and further performances against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] secured him a place in the squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=6}}</ref> However, he put in mediocre performances in warm-up games against [[Finland national football team|Finland]] and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], and so [[Jimmy Greaves]] and [[Roger Hunt]] were instead picked for the final friendly game against [[Poland national football team|Poland]].<ref name=\"page 7\">{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=7}}</ref> Greaves and Hunt were indeed picked for the three group games against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and France, but in the latter game, Greaves suffered a deep gash to his leg which required stitches, and Hurst was called up to take his place in the quarter final against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].<ref name=\"page 7\"/>\n\nArgentina were talented but preferred a tougher approach to the game, which saw them reduced to ten men.<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=131}}</ref> The game was still tightly contested as it entered its final 15 minutes, but then [[Martin Peters]] swung over a curling cross from the left flank and Hurst, anticipating his clubmate's action, got in front of his marker to glance a near post header past the Argentine keeper.<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=132}}</ref> England won 1\u20130 and were in the semi-finals.\n\nGreaves was not fit for the game against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] so Hurst and Hunt continued up front, and England won 2\u20131 thanks to two goals by [[Bobby Charlton]], the second of which was set up by Hurst.<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=133}}</ref> As the final against the Germans approached, the media learnt of Greaves' return to fitness and, while appreciating Hurst's contribution, started to call for the return of England's most prolific [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre-forward]]. Ramsey, however, would not be swayed and selected Hurst for [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]].\n\n====World Cup Final====\nWest Germany took the lead through [[Helmut Haller]] early on, but six minutes later [[Bobby Moore]] was fouled just inside the German half of the field. He quickly picked himself up and delivered the free kick to Hurst, who eluded his marker \n[[Horst-Dieter H\u00f6ttges]] and headed the ball past goalkeeper [[Hans Tilkowski]] to level the scores at 1\u20131.<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=11}}</ref>\n\nWith 12 minutes left to play of normal time, an [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] corner left Hurst with a shooting opportunity on the edge of the penalty area; his shot deflected off [[Wolfgang Weber]] and fell kindly to [[Martin Peters]], who put the ball into the net to give England the lead.<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=12}}</ref> However the Germans scored a very late goal through Weber to level the match at 2\u20132 at full-time.\n\nIn the first period of extra-time, Ball made a cross across the near post to Hurst, who struck a strong shot towards goal with his right foot, falling backwards as he did so.<ref name=\"page 13\">{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=13}}</ref> The ball beat the goalkeeper, hit the crossbar and bounced down before Weber headed it out for a corner.

He  did play, and score, in the 2\u20130 third-place play-off victory over the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] at the [[Stadio Olimpico]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=178}}</ref>\n\nHurst scored his second international hat-trick on 12 March 1969, in a 5\u20130 victory over [[France national football team|France]], and was named in the Ramsey squad which played in [[Mexico]] to defend the World Cup in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=179}}</ref> He scored the only goal of England's opening game against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] after being sent through by a pass from [[Francis Lee]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=198}}</ref> England progressed to the quarter finals, where once again they faced West Germany. Hurst played a part in the [[Martin Peters]] goal that put England 2\u20130 up. With England up 2-1, Hurst's contested header trickled inches past the post. Later, at 2\u20132, Hurst had what many thought was a legitimate goal ruled out for offside.<ref>England: The Official F.A History, Niall Edworthy, Virgin Publishers, 1997, {{ISBN|1-85227-699-1}}.</ref> The West Germans scored in extra time and won 3\u20132.<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=206}}</ref>\n\nHurst scored against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in qualification for [[UEFA Euro 1972]], but played his last international match on 29 April 1972 as England were beaten 3\u20131 by West Germany&nbsp;\u2013 he was replaced by [[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]] with 20 minutes left to play and did not take to the field in an England shirt again.<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=219}}</ref> He was named in the squad for the second leg against West Germany after [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]] and Francis Lee picked up injuries, but had to pull out of the squad after picking up an injury himself.<ref>{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=221}}</ref>\n\n==Managerial career==\nUpon his retirement from playing, Hurst moved into management and coaching.

In 1609, Cosimo became Grand Duke Cosimo II of [[Tuscany]]. Galileo, seeking patronage from his now-wealthy former student and his powerful family, used the discovery of Jupiter's moons to gain it.<ref name=Galileo89/> On February 13, 1610, Galileo wrote to the Grand Duke's secretary:\n\n<blockquote>\"God graced me with being able, through such a singular sign, to reveal to my Lord my devotion and the desire I have that his glorious name live as equal among the stars, and since it is up to me, the first discoverer, to name these new planets, I wish, in imitation of the great sages who placed the most excellent heroes of that age among the stars, to inscribe these with the name of the Most Serene Grand Duke.\"<ref name=Galileo89/></blockquote>\n\nGalileo asked whether he should name the moons the \"Cosmian Stars\", after Cosimo alone, or the \"Medician Stars\", which would honor all four brothers in the Medici clan. The secretary replied that the latter name would be best.<ref name=Galileo89/>\n\nOn March 12, 1610, Galileo wrote his dedicatory letter to the Duke of Tuscany, and the next day sent a copy to the Grand Duke, hoping to obtain the Grand Duke's support as quickly as possible. On March 19, he sent the telescope he had used to first view Jupiter's moons to the Grand Duke, along with an official copy of ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (''The Starry Messenger'') that, following the secretary's advice, named the four moons the Medician Stars.<ref name=Galileo89/> In his dedicatory introduction, Galileo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nScarcely have the immortal graces of your soul begun to shine forth on earth than bright stars offer themselves in the heavens which, like tongues, will speak of and celebrate your most excellent virtues for all time. Behold, therefore, four stars reserved for your illustrious name ... which ... make their journeys and orbits with a marvelous speed around the star of Jupiter ... like children of the same family ...

''Sidera'' is the plural form of the Latin noun ''[[wikt:sidus#Latin|sidus]]'' \"star, constellation\".</ref> At Cosimo's suggestion, Galileo changed the name to '''Medicea Sidera''' (\"the '''Medician stars'''\"), honouring all four Medici brothers (Cosimo, Francesco, [[Carlo de' Medici (cardinal)|Carlo]], and Lorenzo). The discovery was announced in the ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (\"Starry Messenger\"), published in [[Venice]] in March 1610, less than two months after the first observations.\n\nOther names put forward include:\n* I.

Callisto, the outermost and least dense of the four, has a density intermediate between ice and rock whereas Io, the innermost and densest moon, has a density intermediate between rock and iron. Callisto has an ancient, heavily cratered and unaltered ice surface and the way it rotates indicates that its density is equally distributed, suggesting that it has no rocky or metallic core but consists of a homogeneous mix of rock and ice. This may well have been the original structure of all the moons. The rotation of the three inner moons, in contrast, indicates differentiation of their interiors with denser matter at the core and lighter matter above. They also reveal significant alteration of the surface. Ganymede reveals past tectonic movement of the ice surface which required partial melting of subsurface layers. Europa reveals more dynamic and recent movement of this nature, suggesting a thinner ice crust. Finally, Io, the innermost moon, has a sulfur surface, active volcanism and no sign of ice. All this evidence suggests that the nearer a moon is to Jupiter the hotter its interior. The current model is that the moons experience tidal heating as a result of the gravitational field of Jupiter in inverse proportion to the square of their distance from the giant planet. In all but Callisto this will have melted the interior ice, allowing rock and iron to sink to the interior and water to cover the surface. In Ganymede a thick and solid ice crust then formed. In warmer Europa a thinner more easily broken crust formed. In Io the heating is so extreme that all the rock has melted and water has long ago boiled out into space.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n[[Image:Jupiter.moons1.jpg|thumb|600px|center|<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Surface features of the four members at different levels of zoom in each row</div>]]\n</div>\n\n===Size===\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n[[File:Moons of solar system v7.jpg|thumb|900px|center|Galilean moons compared with other Solar System bodies, although pixel scale is not accurate at this resolution.]]\n</div>\n\n===Latest flyby===\n{{multiple image\n| width     = 100\n| footer    = <div style=\"text-align: center;\">Jupiter and Galilean moons circa 2007, imaged by ''[[New Horizons]]'' during flyby.

She enjoyed listening to the radio, and to records by [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Sarah Vaughan]]. Her father played the ukulele and guitar and sang professionally in nightclubs with a group called Step 'n' Fetchit. Gloria grew up as a tomboy as in her early life she had 5 brothers, but no sister.  Her brothers sang gospel and formed a quartet with a friend. Gaynor was not allowed to sing with the all-male group, nor was her younger brother, Arthur, because Gloria was a girl and he was too young. Arthur later acted as a tour manager for Gaynor. The family was relatively poor, but Gaynor recalls the house being filled with laughter and happiness, and the dinner table being open to neighborhood friends. They moved to a housing project in 1960, where Gaynor went to South Side High School. \"All through my young life I wanted to sing, although nobody in my family knew it\", Gaynor wrote in her autobiography.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}Gaynor began singing in a night club in Newark, NJ., where she was recommended to a local band by a neighbor.  After several years of performing in local clubs and along the Country's east coast Gaynor began her recording career in 1971 at Columbia Records.  The rest of Gaynor's life story can be found in her autobiography, \"I Will Survive\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Early career==\nGaynor was a singer with the Soul Satisfiers, a [[jazz]]/[[R&B music]] band, in the 1960s. She recorded \"She'll Be Sorry/Let Me Go Baby\" (for the first time as ''Gloria Gaynor'') in 1965, for Johnny Nash's Jocida label. Her first real success came in 1975 when she was signed to Columbia Records by Clive Davis. The fruit of that was the release of her album ''[[Never Can Say Goodbye (Gloria Gaynor album)|Never Can Say Goodbye]]'' on Columbia Records. The first side of the album consisted of three songs (\"Honey Bee\", \"[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]\" and \"[[Reach Out I'll Be There|Reach Out, I'll Be There]]\") with no break between the songs. This 19-minute dance marathon proved to be enormously popular, especially at dance clubs. All three songs were released as singles via radio edits and all of them became hits. The album was instrumental in introducing disco music to the public, \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" becoming the first song to top ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play|dance chart]]. The original version by [[The Jackson 5]] was also successful on the mainstream [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop Charts]], peaking at #9, and on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B Charts]], reaching #34. It also marked her first significant chart success internationally, making it into the Top 5 in Australia, Canada, Germany and the UK. The song would go on to be certified silver by the [[British Phonographic Industry]], and subsequently gold in the US.  Capitalizing on the success of her first album, she quickly released her second album, ''[[Experience Gloria Gaynor]]'', later that same year. Some of her lesser-known singles, due to lack of recurrent airplay \u2014 including \"Honey Bee\" (1974), \"Casanova Brown\" (1975), and \"Let's Make A Deal\" (1976), as well as her cover of [[Four Tops|The Four Tops]]' \"Reach Out, I'll Be There\" (which also became a #14 hit on the [[UK Singles Chart]]) \u2014 became hits in the clubs and reached the Top 5 on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'''s disco charts. Many charted on the Hot 100 and R&B charts as well, with songs like \"(If You Want It) Do It Yourself\" - a #1 disco hit - peaking at #98 on the Pop Charts and #24 on the R&B Charts. Her cover of \"[[How High the Moon|How High The Moon]]\" topped the US Dance Charts, and made the lower parts of both the Pop and R&B charts, as well as achieving some international chart success. After her 1976 album, ''[[I've Got You]]'', she shifted from her hit production team, to work with other productions.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Since then, Gloria Gaynor had recorded some 16 albums including one in England, One in Germany,  and 2 in Italy.\n\n==Major mainstream breakthrough==\nIn the next few years, Gaynor released the albums ''[[Glorious (Gloria Gaynor album)|Glorious]]'' and ''[[Gloria Gaynor's Park Avenue Sound]]'', but would only enjoy a few more moderate hits. However, in late 1978, with the release of her album ''[[Love Tracks (Gloria Gaynor album)|Love Tracks]]'', she climbed the pop charts again with her smash hit single \"[[I Will Survive]]\". The lyrics of this song are written from the point of view of a woman, recently dumped, telling her former lover that she can cope without him and does not want anything more to do with him. The song has become something of an anthem of female [[Emancipation of women|emancipation]]. Interestingly, the song \"[[I Will Survive]]\"  was originally the B-side when Polydor Records released it in late 1978. The A-side, a song called \"Substitute\", then a recent worldwide hit for South African girl-group [[Clout (band)|Clout]], was considered more \"radio friendly\". Boston Disco Radio DJ Jack King, turned the record over and recalls being stunned by what he heard. \"I couldn't believe they were burying this monster hit on the B-side\", says King. \"I played it and played it and my listeners went nuts!\" This massive audience response forced the record company to flip the songs, so that subsequent copies of the single listed the more popular song on the A-side.  King was honored at New York's \"Disco Masters Awards Show\" for 3 consecutive years (1979\u20131981) in recognition of his relentless push of the song. The song received the Grammy Award for Best Disco Recording in 1980, the only year that award was given. It is ranked #492 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of \"the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", and ranked at #97 on Billboard magazine's \"All-Time Hot 100\". In 2000, the song was ranked #1 in VH1's list of the '100 greatest dance songs' of all time.\n\nAs a disco number, the song was unique for its time by virtue of Gaynor's having no background singers or lush production. And, unlike her first disco hits, the track was not pitched up to make it faster and to render Gaynor's recorded voice in a higher register than that in which she actually sang. Most disco hits at the time were heavily produced, with multiple voices, overdubs, and adjustments to pitch and speed. \"I Will Survive\" had a much more spare and \"clean\" sound. Had it been originally planned and released as an A-side, it would almost certainly have undergone a substantially more heavy-handed remix. In late 1979, she released the album ''[[I Have a Right]]'' which contained her next disco hit, \"Let Me Know (I Have a Right)\",  which featured [[Doc Severinsen]] of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' fame, on trumpet solo. Gaynor also recorded a disco song called \"Love Is Just a Heartbeat Away\" in 1979 for the vampire movie ''[[Nocturna: Granddaughter of Dracula]]'' which featured a number of Disco songs.\n\n==Stateside career==\nIn 1980 and again in 1981, Gaynor released two disco albums which were virtually ignored in the United States due to the [[Disco#Backlash and decline|backlash against disco]], which began late in 1979. The album's singles barely registered on [[Urban contemporary]] radio, where disco music remained popular. In 1982, having looked into a wide variety of faiths and religious movements,<ref>{{cite news| last = Daneff  | first = Tiffany| title = The Arts: The new gospel according to Gloria She survives, and prospers, but the queen of the disco has done with clubbing, writes Tiffany Daneff  | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = July 17, 1993 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last = Quigley | first = Elizabeth  | title = Disco's born survivor  | work = [[The Scotsman]] | date = April 9, 1996  }}</ref> she became a [[Christian]] and began to distance herself from a past she considered to be [[sin]]ful. She would not release an album in 1982. In 1983, she released an album entitled ''[[Gloria Gaynor (Gloria Gaynor album)|Gloria Gaynor]]'', in which she rejected [[disco]] for mid-tempo R&B and Pop style songs. The album contained a patriotic song called \"America\" as well as a new version of \"I Will Survive\". In this new version of \"I Will Survive\", she changed the lyrics of the song in order to advertise her recent conversion to [[Christianity]]. The words \"It took all the strength I had not to fall apart\" were changed to \"Only the Lord could give me strength not to fall apart\". \n\nGaynor would achieve her final success in the 1980s with the release of her album ''[[I Am Gloria Gaynor]]'' in 1984. This was mainly due to the song \"[[I Am What I Am (Broadway musical song)|I Am What I Am]]\", which became a hit at dance clubs, and then on the Club Play chart in late 1983/early 1984. \"I Am What I Am\" made Gaynor a [[gay icon]]. Her 1986 album, ''[[The Power of Gloria Gaynor]]'', was almost entirely composed of cover versions of other songs that were popular at the time. \n\n==Career revival==\nGaynor's career received a revitalizing spark in the early and mid 1990s with the worldwide disco revival movement. During the late 1990s, she dabbled in acting for a while, guest starring on ''[[The Wayans Bros]]'', ''[[That '70s Show]]'' (singing \"I Will Survive\"), and ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' before doing a limited engagement performance in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway's]] ''[[Smokey Joe's Cafe]]''. In 2001 Gaynor performed \"I Will Survive\" at the 30th Anniversary Concert for [[Michael Jackson]].\n[[File:Gloria Gaynor 2003.jpg|thumb|Gaynor in 2003]]\nGloria Gaynor returned to the recording studio in 2002, releasing her first album in over 15 years, entitled, ''I Wish You Love''. The two singles released from the album, \"Just Keep Thinking About You\" and \"I Never Knew\", both topped ''Billboard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]]. Both singles also secured moderate to heavy Dance format radio airplay. The latter song also charted #30 on ''Billboard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart. In 2004, Gaynor re-released her 1997 album ''[[The Answer (Gloria Gaynor album)|The Answer]]'' (also released under the title ''What a Life'') as a follow up to her successful album ''[[I Wish You Love (Gloria Gaynor album)|I Wish You Love]]''. The album includes her popular club hit \"Oh, What a Life\".\n\nIn late 2002, Gaynor appeared with many R&B stars on the \"Rhythm, Love, and Soul\" edition of the PBS series American Soundtrack. Her performance of the Disco hit \"I Will Survive\" and new single \"I Never Knew\" was included on the accompanying live album that was released in 2004.\n\nOn September 19, 2005, Gaynor was honored twice when she and her music were inducted into the [[Dance Music Hall of Fame]], in the \"Ar''tist\"'' category along with fellow disco legends [[Chic (band)|Chic]] and [[Sylvester (singer)|Sylvester]]. Her classic anthem \"I Will Survive\" was inducted under the \"R''ecords\"'' category. In January 2008, The American Diabetes Association named Gaynor the Honorary Spokesperson of the 2008 NYC Step Out to Fight Diabetes Walk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stepout.diabetes.org/site/TR/StepOut/StepOut080058010?pg=entry&fr_id=5415|title=Step Out: Walk to Fight Diabetes: New York City, NY|work=diabetes.org}}</ref>\n\nMore television appearances followed in the late 2000s with 2009 appearances on  ''The John Kerwin Show'', ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'',<ref>{{Citation|last=DJBigBlender|title=Disco Star Gloria Gaynor on the Wendy Williams show (October 2009)|date=2016-11-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXg3Ne4aTyI|accessdate=2016-11-07}}</ref> and ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' to promote the 30th anniversary of \"I Will Survive\".<ref>{{YouTube|y6t5LV-1rMo}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref>\nIn 2010, she appeared on ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.\n\nAfter almost 40 years of its release, Gaynor continues to ride the success of \"I Will Survive\", touring the country and the world over and performing her signature song on dozens of TV shows. A few successful remixes of the song during the 1990s and 2000s along with new versions of the song by [[Lonnie Gordon]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Chantay Savage]], rock group [[Cake (band)|Cake]] and others as well as constant recurrent airplay on nearly all [[Soft AC]] and Rhythmic format radio stations have helped to keep the song in the mainstream. Said Gaynor of her biggest hit in a 2012 interview: \"It feels great to have such a song like that because I get kids five and six years old telling me they like the song, and then people seventy-five and eighty. It's quite an honor.\"<ref name=\"Ask American Profile Page 2\">Ask American Profile. Published in ''American Profile'' newsmagazine. January 29, 2012 edition.

When applied to the estimated age of the universe at 13.8 billion years, from the perspective of the point of origin, the universe today would appear to have just begun its sixth day of existence, or if the universe is 15 billion years old from the perspective of earth, it would appear to have just completed its sixth day.<ref>The Hidden Face of God: Science Reveals the Ultimate Truth by Gerald L.

In [[ghostlore]], descriptions of ghosts vary widely from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes, to realistic, lifelike visions. The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as [[necromancy]], or in [[spiritism]] as a ''[[s\u00e9ance]]''.\n\nThe belief in the existence of an [[afterlife]], as well as manifestations of the spirits of the dead, is widespread, dating back to [[animism]] or [[ancestor worship]] in pre-literate cultures. Certain religious practices\u2014funeral rites, [[exorcism]]s, and some practices of [[spiritualism]] and [[ritual magic]]\u2014are specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead.

It is common to [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]], but lacking in [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] and [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] (the equivalent word in [[Gothic language|Gothic]] is ''ahma'', [[Old Norse]] has ''andi'' m., ''\u00f6nd'' f.). The prior [[Proto-Indo-European]] form was ''{{PIE|*\u01f5\u02b0\u00e9ysd-os}}'', from the root '' {{PIE|*\u01f5\u02b0\u00e9ysd-}}'' denoting \"fury, anger\" reflected in Old Norse ''geisa'' \"to rage\". The Germanic word is recorded as masculine only, but likely continues a neuter ''s''-stem. The original meaning of the Germanic word would thus have been an animating principle of the [[mind]], in particular capable of excitation and fury (compare ''[[\u00f3\u00f0r]]''). In [[Germanic paganism]], \"[[Germanic Mercury]]\", and the later [[Odin]], was at the same time the [[conductor of the dead]] and the \"lord of fury\" leading the [[Wild Hunt]].\n\nBesides denoting the human spirit or soul, both of the living and the deceased, the Old English word is used as a synonym of Latin ''[[spirit]]us'' also in the meaning of \"breath\" or \"blast\" from the earliest attestations (9th century).

Strategies for preventing revenants may either include [[sacrifice]], i.e., giving the dead food and drink to pacify them, or magical banishment of the deceased to force them not to return.

This is depicted in artwork from various ancient cultures, including such works as the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', which shows deceased people in the afterlife appearing much as they did before death, including the style of dress.\n\n===Fear of ghosts===\n{{main article|Fear of ghosts}}\n[[File:Suushi Yurei.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Y\u016brei]] (Japanese ghost) from the [[Hyakkai Zukan]], ca. 1737]]\nWhile deceased ancestors are [[cultural universal|universally]] regarded as venerable, and often believed to have a continued presence in some form of [[afterlife]], the spirit of a deceased person that persists in the material world (a ghost) is regarded as an unnatural or undesirable state of affairs and the idea of ghosts or [[revenant]]s is associated with a reaction of fear. This is universally the case in pre-modern folk cultures, but fear of ghosts also remains an integral aspect of the modern [[ghost story]], [[Gothic horror]], and other [[horror fiction]] dealing with the supernatural.\n\n===Common attributes===\nAnother widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty, airy, or subtle material. [[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] link this idea to early beliefs that ghosts were the person within the person (the person's spirit), most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person's breath, which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist.<ref name=\"EncyOccult\"/> This belief may have also fostered the metaphorical meaning of \"breath\" in certain languages, such as the [[Latin]] ''spiritus'' and the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[pneuma]]'', which by [[analogy]] became extended to mean the soul. In the [[Bible]], [[God]] is depicted as synthesising [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], as a living soul, from the dust of the Earth and the breath of God.\n\n\n\nIn many traditional accounts, ghosts were often thought to be deceased people looking for vengeance ([[vengeful ghost]]s), or imprisoned on earth for bad things they did during life. The appearance of a ghost has often been regarded as an omen or portent of death. Seeing one's own ghostly double or \"[[Doppelg\u00e4nger|fetch]]\" is a related omen of death.<ref>Hole, pp. 13\u201327</ref>\n\n[[File:Union Graveyard III.jpg|thumb|Union Cemetery in [[Easton, Connecticut]] is home to the legend of the White Lady.]]\n[[White Lady (ghost)|White ladies]] were reported to appear in many rural areas, and supposed to have died tragically or suffered trauma in life. White Lady legends are found around the world. Common to many of them is the theme of losing a child or husband and a sense of purity, as opposed to the [[Lady in Red (ghost)|Lady in Red]] ghost that is mostly attributed to a jilted lover or prostitute. The White Lady ghost is often associated with an individual family line or regarded as a harbinger of death similar to a [[banshee]].\n\nLegends of ghost ships have existed since the 18th century; most notable of these is the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''. This theme has been used in literature in ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' by Coleridge.\n\nThey are often depicted as being covered in a shroud and/or dragging chains.\n\n===Cultural===\nThe idea of ghosts can be considered a tradition for certain cultures. Many believe in the spirit world and often try to stay in contact with their loved ones.{{explain|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Locale===\n{{See also|Haunted house}}\nA place where ghosts are reported is described as [[list of reportedly haunted locations|haunted]], and often seen as being inhabited by [[soul (spirit)|spirits]] of deceased who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property. Supernatural activity inside homes is said to be mainly associated with violent or tragic events in the building's past such as murder, accidental death, or suicide\u2014sometimes in the recent or ancient past. But not all hauntings are at a place of a violent death, or even on violent grounds. Many cultures and religions believe the essence of a being, such as the '[[soul (spirit)|soul]]', continues to exist.

Homer's ghosts had little interaction with the world of the living. Periodically they were called upon to provide advice or prophecy, but they do not appear to be particularly feared.

The spirit of the dead was believed to hover near the resting place of the corpse, and cemeteries were places the living avoided. The dead were to be ritually mourned through public ceremony, sacrifice, and libations, or else they might return to haunt their families.

Knowing that the house was supposedly haunted, Athenodorus intentionally set up his writing desk in the room where the apparition was said to appear and sat there writing until late at night when he was disturbed by a ghost bound in chains. He followed the ghost outside where it indicated a spot on the ground. When Athenodorus later excavated the area, a shackled skeleton was unearthed. The haunting ceased when the skeleton was given a proper reburial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1083.html |title=LXXXIII.

Similarly, Jesus' followers at first believed he was a ghost (spirit) when they saw him [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]].\n\nOne of the first persons to express disbelief in ghosts was [[Lucian of Samosata]] in the 2nd century AD. In his satirical novel ''[[Lover of Lies|The Lover of Lies]]'' (circa 150 AD), he relates how [[Democritus]] \"the learned man from [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] in [[Thrace]]\" lived in a tomb outside the [[city gate]]s to prove that cemeteries were not haunted by the spirits of the departed. Lucian relates how he persisted in his disbelief despite [[practical joke]]s perpetrated by \"some young men of Abdera\" who dressed up in black robes with skull masks to frighten him.<ref>\"The Doubter\" by Lucian in Roger Lancelyn Green (1970) ''Thirteen Uncanny Tales''. London, Dent: 14\u201321; and Finucane, pg 26.</ref> This account by Lucian notes something about the popular classical expectation of how a ghost should look.\n\nIn the 5th century AD, the Christian priest [[Constantius of Lyon]] recorded an instance of the recurring theme of the improperly buried dead who come back to haunt the living, and who can only cease their haunting when their bones have been discovered and properly reburied.<ref>F. R. Hoare, ''The Western Fathers'', Sheed & Ward: New York, 1954, pp. 294\u20135.</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\nGhosts reported in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] tended to fall into two categories: the souls of the dead, or demons. The souls of the dead returned for a specific purpose. Demonic ghosts existed only to torment or tempt the living. The living could tell them apart by demanding their purpose in the name of Jesus Christ. The soul of a dead person would divulge its mission, while a demonic ghost would be banished at the sound of the Holy Name.<ref>Finucane, Ch. 3</ref>\n\nMost ghosts were souls assigned to [[Purgatory]], condemned for a specific period to atone for their transgressions in life. Their penance was generally related to their sin. For example, the ghost of a man who had been abusive to his servants was condemned to tear off and swallow bits of his own tongue; the ghost of another man, who had neglected to leave his cloak to the poor, was condemned to wear the cloak, now \"heavy as a church tower\". These ghosts appeared to the living to ask for prayers to end their suffering. Other dead souls returned to urge the living to confess their sins before their own deaths.<ref>Fincucane, pp. 70\u201377.</ref>\n\nMedieval European ghosts were more substantial than ghosts described in the [[Victorian era|Victorian age]], and there are accounts of ghosts being wrestled with and physically restrained until a priest could arrive to hear its confession. Some were less solid, and could move through walls. Often they were described as paler and sadder versions of the person they had been while alive, and dressed in tattered gray rags. The vast majority of reported sightings were male.<ref>Finucane, pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nThere were some reported cases of ghostly armies, fighting battles at night in the forest, or in the remains of an [[Iron Age]] hillfort, as at [[Wandlebury]], near Cambridge, England. Living knights were sometimes challenged to single combat by phantom knights, which vanished when defeated.<ref name=\"Finucanepg\">Finucane, pg. 79.</ref>\n\nFrom the medieval period an apparition of a ghost is recorded from 1211, at the time of the [[Albigensian Crusade]].<ref>[[Mark Gregory Pegg]] (2008) ''A Most Holy War''.

Through his cousin, who spoke for him, the boy allegedly held conversations with anyone who wished, until the local priest requested to speak to the boy directly, leading to an extended disquisition on theology. The boy narrated the trauma of death and the unhappiness of his fellow souls in [[Purgatory]], and reported that God was most pleased with the ongoing Crusade against the [[Cathar]] heretics, launched three years earlier. The time of the Albigensian Crusade in southern France was marked by intense and prolonged warfare, this constant bloodshed and dislocation of populations being the context for these reported visits by the murdered boy.\n\nHaunted houses are featured in the 9th-century ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' (such as the tale of ''[[list of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad]]'').<ref>{{cite book |title=The Arabian Nights and Orientalism: Perspectives from East & West |last=Yuriko Yamanaka |first=Tetsuo Nishio |publisher=[[I.B.

A common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger, often with unfinished business, such as 1989's ''[[Field of Dreams]]'', the 1990 film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', and the 1993 comedy ''[[Heart and Souls]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3DE1339F93BA3575BC0A965958260|title=FILM; When It Comes to the Hereafter, Romance and Sentiment Rule|last=Chanko|first=Kenneth M.|date=August 8, 1993|website=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref> In the horror genre, 1980's ''[[The Fog]]'', and the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence.<ref name=\"Newman, pg. 135\"/>\n\nPopularised in such films as the 1984 comedy ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', [[ghost hunting]] became a hobby for many who formed ghost hunting societies to explore reportedly haunted places. The ghost hunting theme has been featured in [[Reality television|reality television series]], such as ''[[Ghost Adventures]]'', ''[[Ghosthunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]'', ''[[Ghost Hunters International]]'', ''[[Ghost Lab]]'', ''[[Most Haunted]]'', and ''[[A Haunting]]''. It is also represented in children's television by such programs as ''[[The Ghost Hunter (TV series)|The Ghost Hunter]]'' and ''[[Ghost Trackers]]''. Ghost hunting also gave rise to multiple guidebooks to haunted locations, and ghost hunting \"how-to\" manuals.\n\nThe 1990s saw a return to classic \"gothic\" ghosts, whose dangers were more psychological than physical. Examples of films from this period include 1999's ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' and ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]''.\n\n[[Asian cinema]] has also produced [[horror film]]s about ghosts, such as the 1998 Japanese film ''[[Ring (film)|Ringu]]'' (remade in the US as ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' in 2002), and the Pang brothers' 2002 film ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E1D61330F93BA35755C0A9659C8B63|title=Why Asian Ghost Stories Are the Best |last=Rafferty|first=Terence|date=June 8, 2003|website=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref>\n[[Indian ghost movies]] are popular not just in India, but in the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia, and other parts of the world.

It [[Christianization of the Roman Empire|became Christian]] under the Late [[History of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]], and acquired its first [[bishop of Geneva|bishop]] in the 5th century, having been connected to the [[Bishopric of Vienne]] in the 4th.\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], Geneva was ruled by a [[county of Geneva|count]] under the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until the late 14th century, when it was granted a charter giving it a high degree of self-governance. Around this time, the [[House of Savoy]] came to at least nominally dominate the city. In the 15th century, an [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[republic]]an government emerged with the creation of the [[Grand Council of Geneva|Grand Council]]. In the first half of the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] reached the city, causing religious strife, during which Savoy rule was thrown off and Geneva allied itself with the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]].\nIn 1541, with Protestantism on the rise, [[John Calvin]], the founder of [[Calvinism]], became the spiritual leader of the city and established the [[Republic of Geneva]]. By the 18th century, Geneva had come under the influence of [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[France]], which cultivated the city as its own. France tended to be at odds with the ordinary townsfolk, which inspired the failed [[Geneva Revolution of 1782]], an attempt to win representation in the government for men of modest means. In 1798, revolutionary France under the [[French Directory|Directory]] annexed Geneva. At the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], on 1{{nbs}}June 1814, Geneva was admitted to the [[Swiss Confederation]]. In 1907, the separation of Church and State was adopted.

There were also 3,959 members of an [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox church]] (2.22%), 220 individuals (or about 0.12% of the population) who belonged to the [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland]], 2,422 (1.36%) who belonged to another Christian church, and 2,601 people (1.46%) who were [[Judaism|Jewish]].

Over the past century, substantial immigration from [[France]] and other predominantly [[Roman Catholic]] countries, as well as general [[Post-Christian Europe|European secularization]]  has changed its religious landscape. As a result, three times as many Roman Catholics as Protestants lived in the city in 2000, while a large number of residents were members of neither group. Geneva forms part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg]].\n\nThe [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[Lutheran World Federation]] both have their headquarters at the [[Ecumenical Centre]] in [[Grand-Saconnex]], Geneva. The [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]], a worldwide organization of [[Presbyterian]], [[Continental Reformed]], [[Congregational]] and other [[Reformed]] churches gathering more than 80 million people around the world was based here from 1948 until 2013. The Executive Committee of the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]] voted in 2012 to move its offices to [[Hanover, Germany]], citing the high costs of running the ecumenical organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The move was completed in 2013. Likewise, the [[Conference of European Churches]] have moved their headquarters from Geneva to Brussels.\n\n====Protestant Rome====\n[[File:ReformationsdenkmalGenf1.jpg|thumb|[[Reformation Wall]] in Geneva; from left to right: [[William Farel]], [[John Calvin]], [[Theodore Beza]], and [[John Knox]]]]\nPrior to the [[Protestant Reformation]] the city was ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' [[Roman Catholic]]. Reaction to the new movement varied across Switzerland. [[John Calvin]] went to Geneva in 1536 after [[William Farel]] encouraged him to do so. In Geneva, the Catholic bishop had been obliged to seek exile in 1532. Geneva became a stronghold of [[Calvinism]]. Some of the tenets created there influenced Protestantism as a whole. [[St. Pierre Cathedral]] was where Calvin and his [[Protestant reformers]] preached. It constituted the epicentre of the newly developing Protestant thought that would later become known as the [[Reformed tradition]]. Many prominent Reformed theologians operated there, including [[William Farel]] and [[Theodore Beza]], Calvin's successor who progressed Reformed thought after his death.\n\nGeneva was a shelter for Calvinists, but at the same time it persecuted Roman Catholics and others considered heretics. The case of [[Michael Servetus]], an early [[Nontrinitarian]], is notable. Condemned by Catholics and Protestants alike, he was arrested in Geneva and burnt at the stake as a heretic by order of the city's Protestant governing council. John Calvin and his followers denounced him, and possibly contributed to his sentence.\n\nIn 1802, during its annexation to France under [[Napoleon I]], the Diocese of Geneva was united with the Diocese of Chamb\u00e9ry, but the 1814 Congress of Vienna and the 1816 [[Treaty of Turin (1816)|Treaty of Turin]] stipulated that in the territories transferred to a now considerably extended Geneva, the Catholic religion was to be protected and that no changes were to be made in existing conditions without an agreement with the Holy See.<ref name=\"CathEncy-LausanneGeneva\">{{Catholic|wstitle=Lausanne and Geneva|inline=yes}}</ref> Napoleon's common policy was to emancipate Catholics in Protestant-majority areas, and the other way around, as well as emancipating Jews. In 1819, the city of Geneva and 20 parishes were united to the Diocese of Lausanne by [[Pope Pius VII]] and in 1822, the non-Swiss territory was made into the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Annecy|Diocese of Annecy]]. A variety of concord with the civil authorities came as a result of the [[separation of church and state]], enacted with strong Catholic support in 1907.<ref name=\"CathEncy-LausanneGeneva\" />\n\n===Crime===\n{{See also|Crime in Switzerland}}\nIn 2014 the incidence of crimes listed in the [[Strafgesetzbuch (Switzerland)|Swiss Criminal Code]] in Geneva was 143.9 per thousand residents. During the same period the rate of drug crimes was 33.6 per thousand residents. The rate of violations of immigration, visa and work permit laws was 35.7 per thousand residents.<ref>[https://www.atlas.bfs.admin.ch/maps/13/de/11488_11587_3864_7266/19010.html Statistical Atlas of Switzerland] accessed 5 April 2016</ref>\n\n== Cityscape ==\n{{wide image|Rade Geneve.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|View of Geneva to the south.

''[[Le Courrier]]'' mainly focuses on Geneva. Both ''[[Le Temps]]'' (headquartered in Geneva) and ''[[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]]'' are widely read in Geneva, but cover the whole of [[Romandy]].\n\nGeneva is the main media center for French-speaking Switzerland. It is the headquarters for the numerous [[French language]] [[radio network|radio]] and [[television network|television]] networks of the [[Swiss Broadcasting Corporation]], known collectively as [[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse]]. While both networks cover the whole of [[Romandy]], special programs related to Geneva are sometimes broadcast on some of the local radio frequencies. Other local radio stations broadcast from the city, including YesFM ([[FM broadcasting|FM]] 91.8&nbsp;MHz), [[Radio Cit\u00e9]] (non-commercial radio, FM 92.2&nbsp;MHz), OneFM (FM 107.0&nbsp;MHz, also broadcast in [[Vaud]]), and [[World Radio Switzerland]] (FM 88.4&nbsp;MHz). L\u00e9man Bleu is a local TV channel, founded in 1996 and distributed by cable. Due to the proximity to France, many [[List of television stations in France|French television channels]] are also available.\n\n=== Traditions and customs ===\nGeneva observes ''[[Je\u00fbne genevois]]'' on the first Thursday following the first Sunday in September. By local tradition, this commemorates the date news of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of Huguenots reached Geneva.\n\nGeneva celebrates ''[[L'Escalade]]'' on the weekend nearest 12 December, celebrating the defeat of the surprise attack of troops sent by [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]] during the night of 11\u201312 December 1602. Festive traditions include chocolate cauldrons filled with vegetable-shaped marzipan treats and the Escalade procession on horseback in seventeenth century armour. Geneva has also been organizing a 'Course de l'Escalade', which means 'Climbing Race'. This race takes place in Geneva's Old Town, and has been popular across all ages. Non-competitive racers dress up in fancy costumes, while walking in the race.\n\nSince 1818, a particular [[chestnut|chestnut tree]] has been used as the official \"herald of the spring\" in Geneva. The ''sautier'' (secretary of the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud. While this event has no practical effect, the sautier issues a formal [[News release|press release]] and the local newspaper will usually mention the news.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geneve.com/en/topicblocks/a-chestnut-tree-the-official-herald-of-spring-in-geneva/|title=A CHESTNUT TREE: THE OFFICIAL HERALD OF SPRING IN GENEVA|last=|first=|date=|website=Geneva Alive|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616234650/https://www.geneve.com/en/topicblocks/a-chestnut-tree-the-official-herald-of-spring-in-geneva/|archive-date=16 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAs this is one of the world's oldest records of a plant's reaction to climatic conditions, researchers have been interested to note that the first bud has been appearing earlier and earlier in the year.

Most of the drinking water (80%) is extracted from the [[Lake Geneva|lake]]; the remaining 20% is provided by [[groundwater]], originally formed by infiltration from the Arve. 30% of the Canton's electricity needs is locally produced, mainly by three [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dams on the [[Rh\u00f4ne]] (Seujet, Verbois and Chancy-Pougny). In addition, 13% of the electricity produced in the Canton is from the burning of waste at the [[Waste management#Incineration|waste incineration facility]] of [[Les Cheneviers]]. The remaining needs (57%) are covered by imports from other cantons in Switzerland or other European countries; SIG buys only electricity produced by [[renewable energy|renewable methods]], and in particular does not use electricity produced using [[nuclear reactor]]s or [[fossil fuels]].\nNatural gas is available in the City of Geneva, as well as in about two-thirds of the municipalities of the canton, and is imported from Western Europe by the Swiss company Gaznat. SIG also provides telecommunication facilities to carriers, [[service provider]]s and large enterprises. From 2003 to 2005, \"Voisin, voisine\" a [[FTTH|fibre to the Home]] pilot project with a [[Triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] offering was launched to test the [[end-user]] market in the Charmilles district.\n\n== International organisations ==\n{{See also|List of international organizations based in Geneva}}\n[[File:WIPO3.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[World Intellectual Property Organization]].]]\n[[File:ONU Geneva mainroom.jpg|thumb|left|The assembly hall of the [[Palace of Nations]].]]\n\nGeneva is the European headquarters of the [[United Nations Office at Geneva|United Nations]], in the [[Palace of Nations]] building, which was also the headquarters of the former League of Nations.

His father founded a marine insurance firm and at one time served as Hawaiian [[consul (representative)#Consulates and embassies|consul-general]] in London. He was also for a time [[churchwarden]] at [[St John-at-Hampstead]]. His grandfather was the physician John Simm Smith, a university colleague of [[John Keats]], and close friend of the eccentric philanthropist [[Ann Thwaytes]].\n\nAs a poet, Hopkins's father published works including ''A Philosopher's Stone and Other Poems'' (1843), ''Pietas Metrica'' (1849), and ''Spicelegium Poeticum, A Gathering of Verses by Manley Hopkins'' (1892). He reviewed poetry for ''[[The Times]]'' and wrote one novel. Catherine (Smith) Hopkins was the daughter of a London physician, particularly fond of music and of reading, especially German philosophy, literature and the novels of [[Dickens]]. Both parents were deeply religious [[high-church]] Anglicans. Catherine's sister, Maria Smith Giberne, taught her nephew Gerard to sketch. The interest was supported by his uncle, Edward Smith, his great-uncle [[Richard James Lane]], a professional artist, and many other family members.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> Hopkins's first ambitions were to be a painter, and he would continue to sketch throughout his life, inspired, as an adult, by the work of [[John Ruskin]] and the [[Pre-Raphaelites]].<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/><ref name=\"PF\">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=81375 Poetry Foundation Biography] accessed 2010-03-18</ref>\n\nHopkins became a skilled draughtsman and found that his early training in visual art supported his later work as a poet.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> His siblings were greatly inspired by language, religion and the creative arts. Milicent (1849\u20131946) joined an Anglican sisterhood in 1878. Kate (1856\u20131933) would go on to help Hopkins publish the first edition of his poetry. Hopkins's youngest sister Grace (1857\u20131945) set many of his poems to music. [[Lionel Charles Hopkins|Lionel]] (1854\u20131952) became a world-famous expert on archaic and colloquial Chinese. Arthur (1848\u20131930) and Everard (1860\u20131928) were both highly successful artists. Cyril (1846\u20131932) would join his father's insurance firm.<ref name=\"PF\" />\n[[File:Young Gerard Manley Hopkins.jpg|thumb|right|Hopkins, painted 24 July 1866]]\n\nManley Hopkins moved his family to Hampstead in 1852, near to where [[John Keats]] had lived thirty years before and close to the wide green spaces of [[Hampstead Heath]]. When ten years old, Gerard Manley Hopkins was sent to board at [[Highgate School]] (1854\u20131863).<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> While studying Keats's poetry, he wrote \"The Escorial\" (1860), his earliest extant poem. Here he practised early attempts at asceticism. He once argued that most people drank more liquids than they really needed and bet that he could go without drinking for a week. He persisted until his tongue was black and he collapsed at drill. On another occasion, he abstained from salt for a week.<ref name=\"PF\" /><ref name=\"ER\">Eleanor Ruggles (1944) ''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Life''.

H. (1963) ''Gerard Manley Hopkins: Poems and Prose'' Penguin pxvii</ref> He began his time in Oxford as a keen socialite and prolific poet, but he seemed to have alarmed himself with the changes in his behaviour that resulted. At Oxford he forged a lifelong friendship with [[Robert Bridges]] (eventual [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]]), which would be of importance in his development as a poet and in establishing his posthumous acclaim.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvii\"/> Hopkins was deeply impressed with the work of [[Christina Rossetti]] and she became one of his greatest contemporary influences, meeting him in 1864.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxviii\">Gardner, W.

Bayfield.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Alfred William Garrett, William Alexander Comyn Macfarlane and Gerard Manley Hopkins (left to right) by Thomas C. Bayfield, 1866]]\nOn 18 January 1866, Hopkins composed his most ascetic poem, ''The Habit of Perfection''. On 23 January, he included poetry in the list of things to be given up for [[Lent]]. In July, he decided to become a Roman Catholic, and he travelled to Birmingham in September to consult the leader of the Oxford converts, [[John Henry Newman]].<ref Name=\"Gardnerxviii\"/> Newman received him into the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on 21 October 1866.\n\nThe decision to convert estranged him from both his family and a number of his acquaintances. After his graduation in 1867, Hopkins was provided by Newman with a teaching post at the Oratory in Birmingham. While there he began to study the violin. On 5 May 1868 Hopkins firmly \"resolved to be a religious.\" Less than a week later, he made a bonfire of his poems and gave up poetry almost entirely for seven years. He also felt the call to enter the ministry and decided to become a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]. He paused to first visit [[Switzerland]], which officially forbade Jesuits to enter.<ref name=\"PF\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">P. Kitchen, ''Gerard Manley Hopkins'', London, 1978.</ref>\n\nHopkins began his Jesuit novitiate at [[Parkstead House|Manresa House]], [[Roehampton]], in September 1868. Two years later, he moved to St Mary's Hall, [[Stonyhurst]], for his philosophical studies, taking vows of poverty, chastity and obedience on 8 September 1870.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gerardmanleyhopkins.net/about/gerard_manley_hopkins.html |title=Gerard Manley Hopkins, Poet Priest Artist Writer Musician |work=Gerard Manley Hopkins' poems to music |first=Sean |last=O'Leary |accessdate=15 May 2017 |date=July 2006 }}</ref> He felt his interest in poetry prevented him from wholly devoting himself to religion. However, on reading [[Duns Scotus]] in 1872 he saw that the two need not conflict.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hopkins/hopkins12.html Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Brief Biography] Glenn Everett, Ph. D.</ref> He continued to write a detailed prose journal between 1868 and 1875. Unable to suppress his desire to describe the natural world, he also wrote music, sketched, and for church occasions wrote some \"verses,\" as he called them. He would later write sermons and other religious pieces.\n\nIn 1874 Hopkins returned to Manresa House to teach classics. While he was studying in the Jesuit house of theological studies, [[St Beuno's Ignatian Spirituality Centre|St Beuno's]], near [[St Asaph]] in [[North Wales]], he was asked by his religious superior to write a poem to commemorate the foundering of a German ship in a storm. So in 1875 he was moved to take up poetry once more and write a lengthy poem, \"[[The Wreck of the Deutschland]]\". The work was inspired by the ''[[Deutschland (1866)|Deutschland]]'' incident, a maritime disaster in which 157 people died, including five [[Franciscan]] nuns who had been leaving Germany due to harsh [[anti-Catholic]] laws (see [[Kulturkampf]]). The work displays both the religious concerns and some of the unusual [[meter (poetry)|meter]] and rhythms of his subsequent poetry not present in his few remaining early works. It not only depicts the dramatic events and heroic deeds but also tells of the poet's reconciling the terrible events with God's higher purpose. The poem was accepted but not printed by a Jesuit publication. This rejection fed his ambivalence about his poetry. Most of his poetry remained unpublished until after his death.\n\n[[File:GerardManleyHopkinsBluePlaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque commemorating Hopkins in Roehampton, London]]\nHopkins chose the austere and restrictive life of a Jesuit and was at times gloomy. Biographer [[Robert Bernard Martin]] notes that \"the life expectancy of a man becoming a novice at twenty-one was twenty-three more years rather than the forty years of males of the same age in the general population.\"<ref name=Ricks/> The brilliant student who had left Oxford with a first-class honours degree failed his final theology exam. This failure almost certainly meant that, although ordained in 1877, Hopkins would not progress in the order. In 1877 he wrote ''God's Grandeur'', an array of sonnets which included \"The Starlight Night\". He finished \"[[The Windhover]]\" only a few months before his ordination. Though rigorous, isolated and sometimes unpleasant, his life during Jesuit training had at least some stability; the uncertain and varied work after ordination was even harder on his sensibilities. In October 1877, not long after he completed \"The Sea and the Skylark\" and only a month after he had been ordained as a priest, Hopkins took up his duties as subminister and teacher at Mount St. Mary's College, Chesterfield. In July 1878 he became curate at the Jesuit church in Mount Street, London. In December he became curate at St. Aloysius's Church, Oxford, then moving to Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow.<ref name=\"PF\" /> While ministering in Oxford, he became a founding member of [[Oxford University Newman Society]], a society established in 1878 for the Catholic members of the [[University of Oxford]]. He taught Greek and Latin at [[Mount St Mary's College]], Sheffield, and [[Stonyhurst College]], Lancashire.\n\nIn 1884 he became professor of Greek and Latin at [[University College Dublin]].<ref>New English key notes 2013 Mentor books Dublin</ref> His English roots and his disagreement with the Irish politics of the time, as well as his own small stature (5 feet 2 inches), unprepossessing nature and personal oddities meant that he was not a particularly effective teacher. This as well as his isolation in Ireland deepened his gloom. His poems of the time, such as \"I Wake and Feel the Fell of Dark, not Day\", reflected this. They came to be known as the \"terrible sonnets\", not because of their quality but because according to Hopkins's friend Canon Richard Watson Dixon, they reached the \"terrible crystal\", meaning that they crystallised the melancholic dejection that plagued the later part of Hopkins' life.\n\n===Final years===\nSeveral issues brought about this melancholic state and restricted his poetic inspiration during the last five years of his life.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxxvii\">Gardner, W.&nbsp;H. (1963) ''Gerard Manly Hopkins: Poems and Prose'' Penguin pxxvii</ref> His work load was extremely heavy. He disliked living in Dublin, away from England and friends; he was also disappointed at how far the city had fallen from its Georgian elegance of the previous century.<ref>http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/gerard-manley-hopkins-ucd-misery-was-literature-s-gain-1.3091916</ref> His general health deteriorated as his eyesight began to fail. He felt confined and dejected. As a devout Jesuit, he found himself in an artistic dilemma. To subdue any egotism which would violate the humility required by his religious position, he decided never to publish his poems. But Hopkins realised that any true poet requires an audience for criticism and encouragement. This conflict between his religious obligations and his poetic talent caused him to feel that he had failed them both.\n\nAfter suffering ill health for several years and bouts of [[diarrhoea]], Hopkins died of [[typhoid fever]] in 1889 and was buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]],<ref>Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 22019). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.</ref> following his funeral in [[Saint Francis Xavier Church, Dublin|Saint Francis Xavier Church]] on [[Gardiner Street]], located in Georgian [[Dublin]]. He is thought to have suffered throughout his life from what today might be diagnosed as either [[bipolar disorder]] or chronic [[unipolar depression]], and battled a deep sense of melancholic anguish. However, on his death bed, his last words were, \"I am so happy, I am so happy. I loved my life.\"<ref name=\"ER\"/>\n\n==Poetry==\n===\"The sonnets of desolation\"===\nAccording to [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]], \"All his life Hopkins was haunted by the sense of personal bankruptcy and impotence, the straining of 'time's eunuch' with no more to 'spend'...\" a sense of inadequacy, graphically expressed in his last sonnets.<ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v13/n08/john-bayley/pork-chops Bayley, John. There's a good to fair chance he was a furry do to his love of nature \"Review: Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life by Robert Bernard Martin\", ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 13 No. 8, 25 April 1991]</ref> Toward the end of his life, Hopkins suffered several long bouts of depression. The \"terrible sonnets\" are a group of poems in which Hopkins struggles with problems of religious doubt. He described them to Bridges as \"[t]he thin gleanings of a long weary while.\"<ref name=Allbery>[http://poems.com/Poets'%20Picks%202012/April_24_Debra_Allbery.html Allbery, Debra. \"To seem the stranger lies my lot, my life\", Poetry Daily, April 24, 2012]</ref>\n\n\"Thou Art Indeed Just, Lord\" (1889) echoes ''Jeremiah'' 12:1 in asking why do the wicked prosper. It reflects the exasperation of the faithful servant who feels he has been neglected, and is addressed to a divine person (\"Sir\") capable of hearing the complaint but seemingly unwilling to listen.<ref>[https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/hopkins-agonistes Boudway, Matthew. \"Hopkins Agonistes\", ''Commonweal'', April 25, 2011]</ref> Hopkins uses parched roots as a metaphor for despair.\n\nThe image of the poet's feeling estranged from God figures in \"I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day\" in which he describes lying awake before dawn likening his prayers to \"dead letters sent To dearest him that lives alas! away.\" The opening line recalls Lamentations 3:2, \"He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.\"\n\n\"No Worst, There is None\" and \"Carrion Comfort\" are also counted among the \"terrible sonnets\".\n\n===Sprung rhythm===\n{{Quote box |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote=<poem>\n'''\"Pied Beauty\"'''\n\nGlory be to God for dappled things\u2014\n For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;\n For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;\nFresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches' wings;\n Landscape plotted and pieced\u2014fold, fallow, and plough;\n And \u00e1ll tr\u00e1des, their gear and tackle and trim.\n\nAll things counter, original, spare, strange;\n Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)\n With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;\nHe fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:\n  Praise him.</poem>\n |source = \"Pied Beauty\" written 1877.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173664 \"Pied Beauty\" at the Poetry Foundation]</ref> }}\n\nMuch of Hopkins's historical importance has to do with the changes he brought to the form of poetry, which ran contrary to conventional ideas of metre. Prior to Hopkins, most [[Middle English]] and [[Modern English]] poetry was based on a rhythmic structure inherited from the Norman side of English literary heritage. This structure is based on repeating \"feet\" of two or three syllables, with the stressed syllable falling in the same place on each repetition. Hopkins called this structure \"running rhythm\", and though he wrote some of his early verse in running rhythm he became fascinated with the older rhythmic structure of the Anglo-Saxon tradition, of which ''[[Beowulf]]'' is the most famous example. Hopkins called his own rhythmic structure [[sprung rhythm]]. Sprung rhythm is structured around feet with a variable number of syllables, generally between one and four syllables per foot, with the stress always falling on the first syllable in a foot. It is similar to the \"rolling stresses\" of [[Robinson Jeffers]], another poet who rejected conventional metre. Hopkins saw sprung rhythm as a way to escape the constraints of running rhythm, which he said inevitably pushed poetry written in it to become \"same and tame.\" In this way, Hopkins sprung rhythm can be seen as anticipating much of [[free verse]]. His work has no great affinity with either of the contemporary [[Pre-Raphaelite]] and [[neo-romanticism]] schools, although he does share their descriptive love of nature and he is often seen as a precursor to [[modernist poetry]] or as a bridge between the two poetic eras.\n\n===Use of language===\nThe language of Hopkins\u2019s poems is often striking. His imagery can be simple, as in ''Heaven-Haven'', where the comparison is between a nun entering a convent and a ship entering a harbour out of a storm. It can be splendidly metaphysical and intricate, as it is in ''As Kingfishers Catch Fire'', where he leaps from one image to another to show how each thing expresses its own uniqueness, and how divinity reflects itself through all of them.\n\nHopkins was a supporter of [[linguistic purism in English]]. In an 1882 letter to [[Robert Bridges]], Hopkins writes: \"It makes one weep to think what English might have been; for in spite of all that Shakespeare and Milton have done&nbsp;... no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity\".<ref>Nils Langer, Winifred V. Davies. ''Linguistic purism in the Germanic languages''. Walter de Gruyter, 2005. p.328</ref> He took time to learn [[Old English]], which became a major influence on his writing. In the same letter to Bridges he calls Old English \"a vastly superior thing to what we have now\".<ref name=\"BROOK-1\">[[George Leslie Brook|Brook, George Leslie]] (1955). ''An Introduction to Old English'', page 1. Manchester University Press.</ref>\n\nHe uses many archaic and dialect words, but also coins new words. One example of this is ''twindles'', which seems from its context in ''Inversnaid'' to mean a combination of ''twines'' and ''dwindles''. He often creates compound adjectives, sometimes with a hyphen (such as ''dapple-dawn-drawn falcon'') but often without, as in ''rolling level underneath him steady air''. This use of compound adjectives, similar to the Old English use of [[Kenning|compounds nouns]], concentrates his images, communicating the [[instress]] of the poet's perceptions of an inscape to his reader.\n\nAdded richness comes from Hopkins's extensive use of [[alliteration]], [[assonance]], [[onomatopoeia]] and [[rhyme]], both at the end of lines and internally as in:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nAs kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame;\nAs tumbled over rim in roundy wells\nStones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell\u2019s\nBow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;\n</poem>}}\n\nHopkins was influenced by the [[Welsh language]] that he acquired while studying theology at [[St Beuno's Ignatian Spirituality Centre|St Beuno's]] near [[St Asaph]]. The poetic forms of [[Literature of Wales (Welsh language)|Welsh literature]] and particularly [[cynghanedd]] with its emphasis on repeating sounds accorded with his own style and became a prominent feature of his work. This reliance on similar-sounding words with close or differing senses means that his poems are best understood if read aloud. An important element in his work is Hopkins's own concept of \"[[inscape]]\" which was derived, in part, from the medieval theologian [[Duns Scotus]]. Anthony Domestico explains,<blockquote>Inscape, for Hopkins, is the charged essence, the absolute singularity that gives each created thing its being; instress is both the energy that holds the inscape together and the process by which this inscape is perceived by an observer. We instress the inscape of a tulip, Hopkins would say, when we appreciate the particular delicacy of its petals, when we are enraptured by its specific, inimitable shade of pink.\"<ref name=Domestico/></blockquote>\n\n''[[The Windhover]]'' aims to depict not the bird in general but instead one instance and its relation to the breeze. This is just one interpretation of Hopkins's most famous poem, one which he felt was his best.<ref name=\"ER\"/>\n{{Quote box |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote=<poem>\n\nI caught this morning morning\u2019s minion, king-\n dom of daylight\u2019s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\n As a skate\u2019s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\n Rebuffed the big wind.

It was only through the efforts of Robert Bridges that his works were seen. Despite Hopkins burning all his poems on entering the Jesuit novitiate, he had already sent some to Bridges who, with a few other friends, was one of the few people to see many of them for some years. After Hopkins's death they were distributed to a wider audience, mostly fellow poets, and in 1918 Bridges, by then [[poet laureate]], published a collected edition; an expanded edition, prepared by [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]], appeared in 1930, and a greatly expanded edition by [[William Henry Gardner]] appeared in 1948 (eventually reaching a fourth edition, 1967, with N. H. Mackenzie).\n\nNotable collections of Hopkins's manuscripts and publications are in [[Campion Hall, Oxford]]; the [[Bodleian Library]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]; and the Foley Library at [[Gonzaga University]] in [[Spokane, Washington]].\n\n===Influences===\n====Erotic====\nTimothy d'Arch Smith, antiquarian bookseller, ascribes to Hopkins suppressed erotic impulses which he views as taking on a degree of specificity after Hopkins met [[Robert Bridges]]'s distant cousin, friend, and fellow Etonian [[Digby Mackworth Dolben]], \"a Christian [[Uranian]]\".<ref>Timothy d'Arch Smith. ''Love in Earnest'', p. 188)</ref> Robert Martin asserts that when Hopkins first met Dolben, on Dolben's 17th birthday, in Oxford in February 1865, it \"was, quite simply, the most momentous emotional event of [his] undergraduate years, probably of his entire life.\"<ref>''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'', p. 80; see also Norman White, ''Hopkins: A Literary Biography'', p. 110)</ref> According to Robert Martin, \"Hopkins was completely taken with Dolben, who was nearly four years his junior, and his private journal for confessions the following year proves how absorbed he was in imperfectly suppressed erotic thoughts of him.\"<ref>Robert Bernard Martin, \"Digby Augustus Stewart Dolben,\" ''DNB'')</ref> Martin is also of the opinion that \"...it is probable that [Hopkins] would have been deeply shocked at the reality of sexual intimacy with another person.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hdXg7cVBH8EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Robert+Bernard+Martin&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjF_-ez_NjOAhUHGR4KHV07D0cQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=Robert%20Bernard%20Martin&f=false Martin, Robert Bernard. ''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'', Chapter III, Faber and Faber]</ref>\n[[File:Gerard Manley Hopkins.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gerard Manley Hopkins]]\nHopkins composed two poems about Dolben, \"Where art thou friend\" and \"The Beginning of the End.\" Robert Bridges, who edited the first edition of Dolben's poems as well as Hopkins's, cautioned that the second poem \"must never be printed,\" though Bridges himself included it in the first edition (1918).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/eng_lit2_19c,5.html |title=Joseph Cady ''English Literature: Nineteenth Century'' |access-date=1 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301045049/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/eng_lit2_19c,5.html |archive-date=1 March 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Another indication of the nature of his feelings for Dolben is that Hopkins's high Anglican confessor seems to have forbidden him to have any contact with Dolben except by letter. Their relationship was abruptly ended by Dolben's drowning in June 1867, an event which greatly affected Hopkins, although his feeling for Dolben seems to have cooled a good deal by that time. \"Ironically, fate may have bestowed more through Dolben\u2019s death than it could ever have bestowed through longer life ...

Hopkins\u2019s journal writings, they argue, offer a clear admiration for feminised beauty. In his book ''Hopkins Reconstructed'' (2000), Justus George Lawler critiques Robert Martin\u2019s controversial biography ''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'' (1991) by suggesting that Martin \"cannot see the heterosexual beam... for the homosexual biographical mote in his own eye... it amounts to a slanted [[eisegesis]]\". The poems that elicit homoerotic readings can be read not merely as exercises in sublimation but as powerful renditions of religious conviction, a conviction that caused strain in his family and even led him to burn some of his poems that he felt were unnecessarily self-centred. Julia Saville\u2019s book ''A Queer Chivalry'' views the religious imagery in the poems as Hopkins\u2019s way of expressing the tension with homosexual identity and desire.\n\n[[Christopher Ricks]] notes that Hopkins engaged in a number of penitential practices, \"... but all of these self-inflictions were not self-inflictions to him, and they are his business\u2014or are his understanding of what it was for him to be about his Father\u2019s business.\"<ref name=Ricks/> Ricks takes issue with Martin's apparent lack of appreciation of the importance of the role of Hopkins' religious commitment to his writing, and cautions against assigning a priority of influence to any sexual instincts over other factors such as Hopkins' estrangement from his family.<ref name=Ricks/> Biographer Paul Mariani finds in Hopkins poems \"... an irreconcilable tension\u2014on the one hand, the selflessness demanded by Jesuit discipline; on the other, the seeming self-indulgence of poetic creation.\"<ref name=Domestico>[https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/inscape-instress-distress?_ga=1.190997742.596395981.1472016212 Domestico, Anthony. \"Inscape, Instress & Distress\", ''Commonweal'', March 9, 2009]</ref>\n\n====Isolation====\nHopkins spent the last five years of his life as a classics professor at University College Dublin.

''Cis'' and ''trans'' [[Descriptor (Chemistry)|descriptors]] are not used for cases of [[conformational isomerism]] where the two geometric forms easily interconvert, such as most open-chain single-bonded structures; instead, the terms \"''syn''\" and \"''anti''\" would be used.\n\nThe term \"geometric isomerism\" is considered by [[IUPAC]] to be an obsolete synonym of \"''cis''\u2013''trans'' isomerism\".<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=G02620|title=geometric isomerism}}</ref>\n\n== Organic chemistry ==\nWhen the [[substituent|substituent groups]] are oriented in the same direction, the [[diastereomer]] is referred to as ''cis'', whereas, when the substituents are oriented in opposing directions, the diastereomer is referred to as  ''trans''. An example of a small hydrocarbon displaying ''cis''\u2013''trans'' isomerism is [[2-butene|but-2-ene]].\n\n[[Alicyclic compound]]s can also display ''cis''\u2013''trans'' isomerism. As an example of a geometric isomer due to a ring structure, consider 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|[[Image:Trans-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane-2D-skeletal.png|100px]] [[Image:Trans-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane-3D-balls.png|150px]] || [[Image:Cis-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane-2D-skeletal.png|100px]] [[Image:Cis-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane-3D-balls.png|150px]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| ''trans''-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane || ''cis''-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane\n|}\n\n=== Comparison of physical properties ===\n''Cis'' and ''trans'' isomers often have different physical properties.

The ''cis'' isomer in this case has a boiling point of 60.3&nbsp;\u00b0C, while the ''trans'' isomer has a boiling point of 47.5&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite book|title=CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|edition=60th|date=1979\u201380|page=C-298}}</ref> In the ''cis'' isomer the two polar C-Cl [[bond dipole moment]]s combine to give an overall molecular dipole, so that there are intermolecular [[intermolecular forces#Dipole-dipole interactions|dipole\u2013dipole forces]] (or Keesom forces), which add to the [[London dispersion forces]] and raise the boiling point. In the ''trans'' isomer on the other hand, this does not occur because the two C\u2212Cl bond moments cancel and the molecule has a net zero dipole (it does however have a non-zero quadrupole).\n\nThe two isomers of butenedioic acid have such large differences in properties and reactivities that they were actually given completely different names. The ''cis'' isomer is called [[maleic acid]] and the ''trans'' isomer [[fumaric acid]]. Polarity is key in determining relative boiling point as it causes increased intermolecular forces, thereby raising the boiling point. In the same manner, symmetry is key in determining relative melting point as it allows for better packing in the solid state, even if it does not alter the polarity of the molecule.  One example of this is the relationship between [[oleic acid]] and [[elaidic acid]]; oleic acid, the ''cis'' isomer, has a melting point of 13.4&nbsp;\u00b0C, making it a liquid at room temperature, while the ''trans'' isomer, elaidic acid, has the much higher melting point of 43&nbsp;\u00b0C, due to the straighter ''trans'' isomer being able to pack more tightly, and is solid at room temperature.\n\nThus, ''trans'' alkenes, which are less polar and more symmetrical, have lower boiling points and higher melting points, and ''cis'' alkenes, which are generally more polar and less symmetrical, have higher boiling points and lower melting points.\n\nIn the case of geometric isomers that are a consequence of double bonds, and, in particular, when both substituents are the same, some general trends usually hold. These trends can be attributed to the fact that the dipoles of the substituents in a ''cis'' isomer will add up to give an overall molecular dipole. In a ''trans'' isomer, the dipoles of the substituents will cancel out {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} due to being on opposite sides of the molecule. ''Trans'' isomers also tend to have lower densities than their ''cis'' counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nAs a general trend, ''trans'' alkenes tend to have higher [[melting point]]s and lower [[solubility]] in inert solvents, as ''trans'' alkenes, in general, are more symmetrical than ''cis'' alkenes.<ref name=\"march\">{{cite book|title=Advanced Organic Chemistry, Reactions, Mechanisms and structure |edition=3rd |page=111 |first=Jerry |last=March |ISBN=0-471-85472-7}}</ref>\n\n[[Vicinal (chemistry)|Vicinal]] [[J-coupling|coupling constant]]s (<sup>3</sup>''J''<sub>HH</sub>), measured by [[NMR spectroscopy]], are larger for ''trans'' (range: 12\u201318&nbsp;Hz; typical: 15&nbsp;Hz) than for ''cis'' (range: 0\u201312&nbsp;Hz; typical: 8&nbsp;Hz) isomers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Spectroscopic Methods in Organic Chemistry|first1=Dudley H.|last1=Williams|first2=Ian|last2=Fleming|edition=4th rev.|publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1989|chapter=Table 3.27|ISBN=007707212X}}</ref>\n\n==== Stability ====\n\nUsually for acyclic systems ''trans'' isomers are more stable than ''cis'' isomers. This is typically due to the increased unfavourable [[Steric effects|steric interaction]] of the substituents in the ''cis'' isomer. Therefore, ''trans'' isomers have a less exothermic [[heat of combustion]], indicating higher [[thermochemistry|thermochemical]] stability.<ref name=\"march\"/> In the Benson [[heat of formation group additivity]] dataset, ''cis'' isomers suffer a 1.10&nbsp;kcal/mol stability penalty. Exceptions to this rule exist, such as [[1,2-difluoroethylene]], [[1,2-difluorodiazene]] (FN=NF), and several other halogen- and oxygen-substituted ethylenes. In these cases, the ''cis'' isomer is more stable than the ''trans'' isomer.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The stereochemical consequences of electron delocalization in extended \u03c0 systems.

For more complex cases, the cis/trans designation is generally based on the longest carbon chain as reflected in the root name of the molecule (i.e. an extension of standard organic nomenclature for the parent structure). The IUPAC standard designations ''E''\u2013''Z'' are unambiguous in all cases, and therefore are especially useful for tri- and tetrasubstituted alkenes to avoid any confusion about which groups are being identified as ''cis'' or ''trans'' to each other.\n\n''Z'' (from the German {{lang|de|zusammen}}) means \"together\". ''E'' (from the German {{lang|de|entgegen}}) means \"opposed\" in the sense of \"opposite\". That is, ''Z'' has the higher-priority groups ''cis'' to each other and ''E'' has the higher-priority groups ''trans'' to each other. Whether a molecular configuration is designated ''E'' or ''Z'' is determined by the [[Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rule]]s; higher atomic numbers are given higher priority. For each of the two atoms in the double bond, it is necessary to determine the priority of each substituent. If both the higher-priority substituents are on the same side, the arrangement is ''Z''; if on opposite sides, the arrangement is ''E''.\n\nBecause the cis/trans and ''E''\u2013''Z'' systems compare different groups on the alkene, it is not strictly true that ''Z'' corresponds to ''cis'' and ''E'' corresponds to trans. For example, ''trans''-2-chlorobut-2-ene (the two methyl groups, C1 and C4, on the [[2-Butene|but-2-ene]] backbone are ''trans'' to each other) is (''Z'')-2-chlorobut-2-ene (the chlorine and C4 are together because C1 and C4 are opposite).\n\n== Inorganic chemistry ==\n''Cis''\u2013''trans'' isomerism can also occur in inorganic compounds, most notably in [[diazene]]s and [[coordination compound]]s.\n\n=== Diazenes ===\n[[Diazene]]s (and the related [[diphosphene]]s) can also exhibit cis/trans isomerism.  As with organic compounds, the ''cis'' isomer is generally the more reactive of the two, being the only isomer that can reduce [[alkene]]s and [[alkyne]]s to [[alkane]]s, but for a different reason: the ''trans'' isomer cannot line its hydrogens up suitably to reduce the alkene, but the ''cis'' isomer, being shaped differently, can.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|[[Image:Trans-diazene-3D-balls.png|150px]] [[Image:Trans-diazene-2D.png|150px]] || [[Image:Cis-diazene-3D-balls.png|150px]] [[Image:Cis-diazene-2D.png|150px]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| ''trans''-diazene || ''cis''-diazene\n|}\n\n=== Coordination complexes ===\nIn inorganic [[coordination complexes]] with octahedral or square planar geometries, there are also ''cis'' isomers in which similar ligands are closer together and ''trans'' isomers in which they are further apart.\n\n[[Image:Cisplatin and transplatin.svg|thumb|right|320px|The two isomeric complexes, cisplatin and transplatin]]\n\nFor example, there are two isomers of [[square planar]] Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, as explained by [[Alfred Werner]] in 1893. The ''cis'' isomer, whose full name is ''cis''-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), was shown in 1969 by [[Barnett Rosenberg]] to have antitumor activity, and is now a chemotherapy drug known by the short name [[cisplatin]]. In contrast, the ''trans'' isomer (transplatin) has no useful anticancer activity. Each isomer can be synthesized using the [[trans effect]] to control which isomer is produced.\n\n{{Double image|right|Cis-dichlorotetraamminecobalt(III).png|160|Trans-dichlorotetraamminecobalt(III).png|160|''cis''-[Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> Cl<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> and ''trans''-[Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> Cl<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>}}\n\nFor [[octahedral complex]]es of formula MX<sub>4</sub>Y<sub>2</sub>, two isomers also exist. (Here M is a metal atom, and X and Y are two different types of [[ligand]]s.) In the ''cis'' isomer, the two Y ligands are adjacent to each other at 90\u00b0, as is true for the two chlorine atoms shown in green in ''cis''-[Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, at left.

The younger Agnarr offering the tortured Gr\u00edmnir something to drink.]]\n\n'''''Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l''''' ('''''Sayings of Gr\u00edmnir''''') is one of the [[Norse mythology|mythological]] poems of the [[Poetic Edda]]. It is preserved in the [[Codex Regius]] manuscript and the [[AM 748 I 4to]] fragment. It is spoken through the voice of ''Gr\u00edmnir'', one of the many guises of the god [[Odin]]. The very name suggests guise, or mask or hood. Through an error, King Geirr\u00f6th tortured Odin-as-Gr\u00edmnir, a fatal mistake, since Odin caused him to fall upon his own sword. The poem is written mostly in the [[lj\u00f3\u00f0ah\u00e1ttr]] metre,<ref>Suzuki, Seiichi. 2014. The Meters of Old Norse Eddic Poetry: Common Germanic Inheritance and North Germanic Innovation. P. 2</ref> typical for wisdom verse.\n\n== Structure and history ==\nThe work starts out with a lengthy prose section describing the circumstances leading up to Gr\u00edmnir's [[monologue]]. The monologue itself comprises 54 stanzas of poetic verse describing the worlds and Odin's many guises. The third and last part of the poem is also prose, a brief description of Geirr\u00f6th's demise, his son's ascension, and Odin's disappearance. \n\nThe prose sections were most likely not part of the original oral versions of Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l. [[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] suggests that they were added in the 12th or 13th century and based on some sort of narrative tradition regarding the poem. This is not entirely certain. The poem itself was likely composed in the first half of the 10th century.<ref>http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe06.htm</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n[[Odin]] and his wife, [[Frigg]], were sitting in [[Hlidskjalf]], looking out on the worlds. They turned their eyes towards King Geirr\u00f6th, who was reigning in the stead of his late father, King Hrauthung. Geirr\u00f6th and his older brother Agnarr had been raised by Odin and Frigg, respectively. The god and goddess had disguised themselves as a peasant and his wife, and had taught the children wisdom. Geirr\u00f6th returned to his father's kingdom where he became king upon his father's death, while Agnarr dwelt with a giantess in a cave.\n\nIn Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf, Odin remarked to Frigg that his foster-child Geirr\u00f6th seemed to be prospering more so than her Agnarr. Frigg retorted that Geirr\u00f6th was so parsimonious and inhospitable that he would torture his guests if he thought there were too many of them. Odin disputed this, and the couple entered into a wager in this respect. Frigg then sent her maid [[Fulla]] to Geirr\u00f6th, advising him that a magician would soon enter his court to bewitch him, and saying that he could be recognised by the fact that no dog was fierce enough to attack him.\n\nGeirr\u00f6th heeded Fulla's false warning. He ordered his men to capture the man the dogs wouldn't attack, which they did. Odin-as-Gr\u00edmnir, dressed in a dark blue cloak, allowed himself to be captured. He stated that his name was Gr\u00edmnir, but he would say nothing further of himself.\n\nGeirr\u00f6th then had him tortured to force him to speak, putting him between two fires for eight nights. After this time, Geirr\u00f6th's son, named Agnarr after the king's brother, came to Gr\u00edmnir and gave him a full horn from which to drink, saying that his father, the king, was not right to torture him.\n\nGr\u00edmnir then spoke, saying that he had suffered eight days and nights, without succour from any save Agnarr, Geirr\u00f6th's son, whom Gr\u00edmnir prophesied would be Lord of the [[Goths]]. He then revealed himself for who he was, as the Highest One, promising Agnarr reward for the drink which he brought him.\n\nShifting from prose to poetry for Odin-as-Gr\u00edmnir's monologue, Gr\u00edmnir describes at great length the [[cosmogony]] of the worlds, the dwelling places of its inhabitants, and himself and his many guises.\n\nEventually, Gr\u00edmnir turns to Geirr\u00f6th and promises him misfortune, revealing his true identity. Geirr\u00f6th then realized the magnitude of his mistake. Having learned that he is undone, he rose quickly to pull Odin from the fires, but the sword which he had lain upon his knee slipped and fell hilt down, so that when the king stumbled he impaled himself upon it. Odin then vanished, and Agnarr, son of the dead King Geirr\u00f6th, ruled in his father's stead.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nThe 12th album of the comic [[Valhalla (comics)|Valhalla]] is loosely based on the poem.\n\nIn the 2017 Starz television adaptation of Neil Gaiman's American Gods, the character Mad Sweeney refers to Mr. Wednesday as Grimnir. Mr. Wednesday later emulates Odin's reveal of his identity through his various names when reveal his own true nature.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikisource|Poetic Edda/Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l|Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l}}\n*[http://www.voluspa.org/grimnismal.htm Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l] in old Norse and [[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]]' translation, at voluspa.org\n\n{{Poetic Edda}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grimnismal}}\n[[Category:Eddic poetry]]\n[[Category:Sources of Norse mythology]]", "sha1": "r0y3f0ukwxvuaaeal6mqocyh4vlrqpg"}}, {"title": "Gravitational interaction", "ns": "0", "id": "12530", "redirect": {"title": "Gravity"}, "revision": {"id": "770814758", "parentid": "648599138", "timestamp": "2017-03-17T19:12:05Z", "contributor": {"username": "Rchard2scout", "id": "6917124"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Replace deprecated {{This is a redirect}} with {{Redirect category shell}}.

It turned out to be one of the biggest box-office hits of 1964.\n\n\"My performances bore me\", said Peppard in a 1964 interview, adding that his ambition was to deliver \"one great performance.

For this role, Peppard earned a private pilot's license and did much of his own stunt flying, although stunt pilot [[Derek Piggott]] was at the controls for the famous under-the-bridge scene.\n\n\"I'm an actor not a star,\" he said around this time, adding that he looked for \"three things\" in a film, \"a good director, a good part and a good script.

He might have been the [[Alan Ladd]] or the [[Richard Widmark]] of the Sixties: but the Sixties didn't want a new Alan Ladd. Peppard began appearing in a series of action movies, predictably as a tough guy, but there were much tougher guys around - like Cagney, Bogart and Robinson, whose films had now become television staples.<ref name=\"Shipman\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Decline===\nA string of Peppard films that followed made little or no impact, including ''[[Tobruk (1967 film)|Tobruk]]'', ''[[P.J. (film)|P.J.]]'', ''[[The Executioner (1970 film)|The Executioner]]'', ''[[House of Cards (1968 film)|House of Cards]]'' and ''[[One More Train to Rob]]'', as well as a romantic comedy called ''[[What's So Bad About Feeling Good?]]'', co-starring [[Mary Tyler Moore]].\n\nIn 1968 he announced he had co written a script ''Watch Them Die'' which he planned to direct, but not star in.<ref>{{cite news|title=George Peppard, With Three Movies Ready for Release, Takes It Easy|first=Dorothy|last= Manners|newspaper= The Washington Post, Times Herald|date=June 4, 1968|page= B8}}</ref> It was never made.\n  \nAmong other disappointments during this period were a pair of westerns, 1970's ''[[Cannon for Cordoba]]'', in which Peppard played the steely Captain Rod Douglas, who has been put in charge of gathering a group of soldiers on a dangerous mission into Mexico, and 1967's ''[[Rough Night in Jericho (film)|Rough Night in Jericho]]'' in which he was billed over [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jean Simmons]], a reflection of his status at that point in his career.\n\n===Television===\nPeppard then decided to turn to television. After developing projects for two years, including making a number of pilots, he had a notable success with ''[[Banacek]]'' (1972\u201374), part of the ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]'' series, starring in 90-minute whodunits as a wealthy Boston playboy who solves thefts for insurance companies for a finder's fee.<ref>{{cite news|title=George Peppard: He can live with his Banacek character|last=Smith|first= Cecil|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=August 27, 1972|page= u2}}</ref> Sixteen regular episodes were produced over two seasons. Both have been released on DVD along with the pilot episode. He also delivered one of his most critically acclaimed, though rarely seen, performances in the TV movie ''Guilty or Innocent: The Sam Sheppard Murder Case'' (1975), as [[Sam Sheppard]].\n\nPeppard appeared in the short-lived (half a season) ''[[Doctors' Hospital]]'' (1975) and several other television films. He starred in the 1977 science-fiction film ''[[Damnation Alley (film)|Damnation Alley]]'', which has gone on to attain a substantial cult following. Peppard's role in the film was reportedly turned down by [[Steve McQueen]] because of salary issues. With fewer interesting roles coming his way, he acted in, directed and produced the drama ''[[Five Days from Home]]'' in 1979.\n\n===Low point===\nPeppard later said the low point of his career came over a three-year period around the time of ''Five Days from Home''. \"It was a bad time\", he said. \"I was heavily in debt. My career seemed to be going nowhere. Not much work over a three year period. Every morning I'd wake up and realise I was getting deeper and deeper into debt\".<ref name=\"george\">{{cite news|title=Pendulum Swings to Peppard|last=Mann|first=Roderick|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 8, 1983|page=G2}}</ref>\n\nHe had to sell his car and take out a second mortgage on his home to finance ''Five Days from Home''. Eventually he got his money back and was able to concentrate on his career.\n\nIn a rare game show appearance, Peppard did a week of shows on ''[[Password Plus]]'' in 1979. Out of five shows, one was never broadcast on [[NBC]] (but aired much later on [[Game Show Network|GSN]] and [[Buzzr]]) because of comments made by Peppard regarding personal dissatisfaction he felt related to his treatment by NBC.\n\n===''Dynasty''===\nIn 1980, Peppard was offered, and accepted, the role of [[Blake Carrington]] in the TV series ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''. During the filming of the pilot episode, which also featured [[Linda Evans]] and [[Bo Hopkins]], Peppard repeatedly clashed with the show's producers, [[Richard and Esther Shapiro]]; among other things, he felt that his role was too similar to that of [[J. R. Ewing]] in the series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''. Three weeks later, before filming was to begin on additional episodes, Peppard was fired and the part was offered to [[John Forsythe]]; the scenes with Peppard were re-shot and Forsythe became the permanent star of the show.<ref>{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Pingel |title=Bo Hopkins Remembers Dynasty! |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050806083533/http://www.hollywoodfyi.com/bo_hopkins_dynasty.htm |work=hollywoodfyi.com |archivedate=August 6, 2005 |accessdate=2010-07-18 |url=http://www.hollywoodfyi.com/bo_hopkins_dynasty.htm }}</ref>\n\n\"It was a big blow\", said Peppard, later adding that Forsythe did \"a better job than I could have done.\"<ref name=\"george\"/>\n\n===''The A-Team''===\nIn 1982, Peppard auditioned for and won the role of Colonel John \"Hannibal\" Smith in the TV action adventure series ''[[The A-Team]]'', acting alongside [[Mr. T]], [[Dirk Benedict]] and [[Dwight Schultz]]. In the series, the A-Team was a team of renegade commandos on the run from the military for \"a crime they did not commit\" while serving in the [[Vietnam war]]. The A-Team members made their collective living as [[Mercenary|soldiers of fortune]], but they helped only people who came to them with justified grievances.\n\nAs Colonel John \"Hannibal\" Smith, Peppard played the leader of the A-Team, distinguished by his cigar smoking, confident smirk, black [[leather gloves]], disguises, and distinctive catch phrase, \"I love it when a plan comes together.\" The show ran five seasons on [[NBC]] from 1983 to 1987. It made Peppard known to a new generation and is arguably his best-known role. It has been reported that the role was originally written with [[James Coburn]] in mind, but Coburn declined and thus it went to Peppard. Peppard was reportedly annoyed by Mr. T upstaging him in his public image, and at one point in their relationship refused to speak directly to Mr. T.  Instead, he sent messages through intermediaries (including at times fellow cast members, particularly Dirk Benedict) and for this Peppard was occasionally portrayed by the press as not a team player.<ref>{{cite news| first=Steve| last=Pratt| title=Not really a team player| work=[[The Northern Echo]]| url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/archive/2006/05/24/770111.Not_really_a_team_player/| archive-url=https://archive.is/20150118193927/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/archive/2006/05/24/770111.Not_really_a_team_player/| dead-url=yes| archive-date=January 18, 2015| date=May 19, 2006| page=15| location=[[Darlington]] UK| accessdate=2015-01-16}}</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nIn his later years he appeared in several stage productions.  In 1988, he portrayed [[Ernest Hemingway]] in the play ''[[PAPA (play)|PAPA]]'', which played a number of cities including Boise, Idaho; Atlanta, Georgia; and San Francisco.  Peppard financed it, and played in it.  In 1992 he toured in ''[[The Lion in Winter]]'', in which he played [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] to [[Susan Clark]]'s [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]].\n\n===''Man Against the Mob''===\nPeppard's last series was an intended occasional series of television movie features entitled ''Man Against the Mob'' set in the 1940s. In these TV detective films, Peppard played [[Los Angeles]] Police Detective Sgt. Frank Doakey. The second film ''Man Against the Mob: The Chinatown Murders'' was broadcast in December 1989. A third film in this series was planned, but Peppard died before it was filmed.\n\n==Personal life==\nPeppard was married five times, and was the father of three children.\n*Helen Davies (1954\u20131964): two children, Bradford and Julie\n*[[Elizabeth Ashley]] (1966\u20131972), his co-star in ''[[The Carpetbaggers (film)|The Carpetbaggers]]'' and [[The Third Day]]: one son, Christian. At their 1972 divorce Peppard had to pay Ashley $2,000 a month in alimony for four years, and up to $400 a month for psychiatric care, plus $350 a month in child support.<ref>{{cite news|title=George Peppard, Elizabeth Ashley Granted Divorce|newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=February 28, 1972|page= aB}}</ref>\n*[[Sherry Boucher|Sherry Boucher-Lytle]] (1975\u20131979), originally from [[Springhill, Louisiana|Springhill]] in northern [[Webster Parish, Louisiana|Webster Parish]], [[Louisiana]]\n*Alexis Adams (1984\u20131986)\n*Laura Taylor (1992\u2013till his death in 1994), a licensed mental health counselor in [[Lake Worth, Florida]]\n\n==Later years and death==\nPeppard overcame a serious alcohol problem in 1978, and subsequently became deeply involved in helping other alcoholics.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} He had smoked three packs of cigarettes a day for most of his life until he quit after being diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in 1992, having part of one lung removed in an operation shortly after the formal diagnosis.<ref>''Bang Out of Order'' {{ISBN|978-1-90284-321-6}} ch. 14</ref>\n\nDespite health problems in his later years, he continued acting.

Richmond geocachers are the real life scavenger hunters|last=News|first=Hedy Ng/Special to the|newspaper=Richmond News|access-date=2017-01-07}}</ref> Cachers who initially place a Travel Bug or Geocoins often assign specific goals for their trackable items. Examples of goals are to be placed in a certain cache a long distance from home, or to travel to a certain country, or to travel faster and farther than other hitchhikers in a race. Less common trends are site-specific information pages about the historic significance of the site, types of trees, birds in the area or other such information. Higher-value items are occasionally included in geocaches as a reward for the First to Find (called \"FTF\"), or in locations which are harder to reach. [[File:Food in geocache.jpg|thumb|A granola bar in a geocache in England. Even if sealed, food is not allowed in geocaches, as it is considered unhygienic and can attract animals.]] Dangerous or illegal items, weapons, food and drugs are not allowed and are specifically against the rules of most geocache listing sites.\n\nIf a geocache has been vandalized or stolen, it is said to have been \"muggled\". The former term plays off the fact that those not familiar with geocaching are called [[muggle]]s, a term borrowed from the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of books which was rising in popularity at the same time geocaching got its start.<ref name=\"Geocaching\" />\n\n===Variations===\nTraditional geocaching gave birth to [[Encounter (game)#GeoCaching|GeoCaching]] \u2013 an active urban game of the [[Encounter (game)|Encounter]] project. The game is quite similar to geocaching but has time limitations and hints.\n\nGeocaches vary in size, difficulty, and location. Simple caches that are placed near a roadside are often called \"drive-bys\", \"park 'n grabs\" (PNGs), or \"cache and dash\". Geocaches may also be complex, involving lengthy searches, significant travel, or use of specialist equipment such as [[SCUBA diving]], [[kayaking]], or [[abseiling]].  Different geocaching websites list different variations per their own policies.\n[[File:Geocache containers range.jpg|thumb|Geocaches come in a range of sizes.

[[ammunition box|Ammo cans]] are considered the gold standard of containers because they are very sturdy, waterproof, animal- and fire-resistant, relatively cheap, and have plenty of room for trade items. Smaller containers are more common in urban areas because they can be more easily hidden.\n\nCaches can be grouped in three categories \u2013 with and without a paper log, and events.\n\nThe following types do not have paper logs.\n\n=== Geocache types ===\nA '''BIT Cache''' is a laminated card with a QR code, similar to [[Munzee]]. The BIT Cache also contains a URL and a password, for logging purposes. They are listed exclusively on opencaching.us.<ref>{{cite web|author=OPENCACHING Geocaching in North America |url=http://www.opencaching.us/ |title=opencaching.us |publisher=opencaching.us |date= |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Cache Parameters\">[http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Cache_parameters Cache Parameters], ''Wiki.opencaching.us;'' retrieved January 12, 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.bitcaching.com/ BITcaching.com], retrieved January 12, 2013</ref>\n[[File:Virtual Cache.JPG|thumb|A Geocacher finding a Virtual Cache at [[McMurdo Station]], [[Antarctica]].|225x225px]]\n\n'''Virtual caches''' are coordinates for a location, which has some other described object. Validation for finding a virtual cache generally requires one to email the cache hider with information such as a date or a name on a plaque, or to post a picture of oneself at the site with GPS receiver in hand.<ref name=\"geo_types\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/about/cache_types.aspx|title=Geocache types|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=geocaching.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref> New virtual caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak,<ref name=\"geocaching.com\">[http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx Geocache Listing Requirements / Guidelines], retrieved January 12, 2013</ref> but they remain supported by other sites.<ref name=\"Cache Parameters\"/>\n\n'''Earthcaches''' are virtual caches that are organized by the [[Geological Society of America]]. The cacher usually has to perform a task which teaches him/her an educational lesson about the earth science of the cache area.<ref name = \"geo_types\"/>\n\n'''Locationless/Reverse caches''' are similar to a [[scavenger hunt]]. A description is given for something to find, such as a one-room schoolhouse, and the finder locates an example of this object. The finder records the location using their GPS receiver and often takes a picture at the location showing the named object and his or her GPS receiver. Typically others are not allowed to log that same location as a find.\n\n'''Webcam caches''' are virtual caches whose coordinates have a public [[webcam]]. The finder is often required to capture their image from the webcam for verification of the find.<ref name = \"geo_types\"/> New webcam caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak,<ref name=\"geocaching.com\"/> but they remain supported by other sites.<ref name=\"Cache Parameters\"/>\n\nFinally, a '''USB Cache''' or '''[[USB dead drop|Dead Drop]] cache'''<ref name=\"Cache Parameters\" /> location has a USB drive embedded (with permission) into walls or other structures. The cache is retrieved by connecting a device that has a USB port and that is able to read standard text files.\n\nThe following types have logs, at least at the final location.\n\nA '''Multi-cache''' consists of multiple discoveries of one or more intermediate points containing the coordinates for the next stage; the final stage contains the log book. An '''Offset cache''' is a multi-cache in which the initial coordinates are for a location containing information that encodes the final cache coordinates. An example would be to direct the finder to a plaque where the digits of a date on the plaque correspond to coordinates of the final cache.<ref name = \"geo_types\"/>\n\nA '''Night Cache''' is multi-stage and intended to be found at night by following a series of reflectors with a flashlight to the final cache location.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=69|title=Night and UV Caches|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Groundspeak Support|access-date=2016-01-16}}</ref>\n\nA '''Chirp Cache''' is a Garmin-created innovative advance on multi caches using new wireless beacon technology.

Not all Wherigo cartridges incorporate geocaches into game play. Wherigo caches are unique to the geocaching.com website.<ref name = \"geo_types\"/>\n\n'''Guest Book Caches''' use guest books often found in museums, tourist information centers, etc. They are listed exclusively at Opencaching.us.<ref name=\"Cache Parameters\"/>\n\nA '''[[letterboxing (hobby)|Letterbox]] Hybrid Cache''' is a combination of a geocache and a letterbox in the same container. A letterbox has a rubber stamp and a logbook instead of tradable items. Letterboxers carry their own stamp with them, to stamp the letterbox's log book and inversely stamp their personal log book with the letterbox stamp. The hybrid cache contains the important materials for this and may or may not include trade items. Whether the letterbox hybrid contains trade items is up to the owner.<ref name = \"geo_types\"/>\n\n'''Moving/Travelling caches''' are found at a listed set of coordinates. The finder hides the cache in a different location, and updates the listing, essentially becomes the hider, and the next finder continues the cycle. This cache type is supported by multiple sites.<ref name=\"Cache Parameters\"/>\n\n'''Mystery/puzzle caches''' require one to discover information or solve a puzzle to find the cache. Some mystery caches provide a false set of coordinates with a puzzle that must be solved to determine the final cache location. In other cases, the given location is accurate, but the name of the location or other features are themselves a puzzle leading to the final cache. Alternatively, additional information is necessary to complete the find, such as a padlock combination to access the cache.<ref name = \"geo_types\"/> Finally, '''Challenge Caches''', (a subtype of the '''Mystery cache''') require a geocacher to complete a reasonably attainable geocaching-related task before being able to log the find. Examples include finding a number of caches that meet a category, completing a number of cache finds within a period of time, or finding a cache for every calendar day, etc.<ref name = \"geo_types\"/>\n\n{{Anchor|eventcache}}\nThere are a few kinds of events.\n\nAn '''Event Cache''' is a gathering organized and attended by geocachers.<ref name=\"geo_types\" />\n\n'''Cache-In Trash-Out (CITO) Events''' are coordinated activities of trash pickup and other maintenance tasks (such as constructing footpaths, planting trees and removing invasive species) to improve the environment.<ref name=\"geo_types\" /> CITO is an ongoing environmental initiative created by Groundspeak Inc. related to geocaching which encourages geocachers to clean up parks and other areas.<ref name=\"geo_types\" /> This is done in two ways: specific events, traditionally around the time of [[Earth Day]] each year,<ref name=\"CITO video link on geocaching blog\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.geocaching.com/2010/05/geocaching-coms-lost-found-video-cache-in-trash-out/|title=Cache In Trash Out \u2013 Geocaching.com\u2019s Lost & Found Video|last=Schudiske|first=Eric|date=May 25, 2010|publisher=blog.geocaching.com|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref> in which groups go around picking up [[litter]] and maintaining the landscape while finding geocaches.<ref name=\"Page on geocaching.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/cito/|title=Geocaching > Cache In Trash Out|publisher=geocaching.com|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=http://m.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/geocaching-photos_n_5850714|title=Oh The Places You'll Go: Geocaching Takes Adventurers To Beautiful, New Spots Every Day|last=Boehrer, McGonial|first=Katherine, Chris|date=2014-09-28|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=2018-02-27}}</ref>\n\nA '''Mega Event''' is defined by attendance of over 500 people.

Geocachers may upload geocache data (also known as [[waypoint]]s) from various websites in various formats, most commonly in file-type [[GPX (data transfer)|GPX]], which uses [[XML]].<ref>{{cite web |title=GPX: The GPS Exchange Format |url=http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}</ref> Some websites allow geocachers to search (build queries) for multiple caches within a geographic area based on criteria such as [[ZIP code]] or [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]], downloading the results as an email attachment on a schedule. In recent years, Android and iPhone users have been able to download apps such as GeoBeagle<ref>{{cite web|last=geobeagleteam|title=GeoBeagle: an Android app for geocaching and letterboxing|url=https://code.google.com/p/geobeagle/|work=Google codes projects|publisher=Google Project Hosting|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref> that allow them to use their 3G and GPS-enabled devices to actively search for and download new caches.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bardua|first=Joachim|title=GeoBeagle \u2013 Geocaching Apps f\u00fcr Android Smartphones (5) (GeoBeagle - Geocaching apps for Android smartphones (5))|url=http://www.navigation-professionell.de/geobeagle-geocaching-apps-fur-android-smartphones-5/|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=Navigation-Professionell|date=May 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Cutler|first=Kim-Mai|title=Augmented reality meets scavenger hunt with GeoBeagle, Wikitude|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/08/09/augmented-reality-meets-scavenger-hunt-with-geobeagle-wikitude/|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=Venturebeat|date=August 9, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Converting and filtering data===\nA variety of geocaching applications are available for geocache data management, file-type translation, and personalization. Geocaching [[software]] can assign special icons or search (filter) for caches based on certain criteria (e.g. distance from an assigned point, difficulty, date last found).\n\n[[File:GeoCache and GPSr.jpg|thumb|Coordinates for a geocache can be downloaded onto a GPS receiver and found, without the need for a printout.]]\n\n'''Paperless geocaching''' means hunting a geocache without a physical printout of the cache description. Traditionally, this means that the seeker has an electronic means of viewing the cache information in the field, such as pre-downloading the information to a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] or other electronic device. Various applications are able to directly upload and read [[GPS eXchange Format|GPX]] files without further conversion. Newer GPS devices released by [[Garmin]], [[DeLorme]] and [[Magellan Navigation|Magellan]] have the ability to read GPX files directly, thus eliminating the need for a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.connect.de/themen_spezial/Outdoor-Navigation-mit-dem-Garmin-Colorado-300_1596951.html |title=Outdoor-Navigation mit dem Garmin Colorado 300 |date=April 1, 2008 |publisher=connect.de |page=1 |language=German |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220202659/http://www.connect.de/themen_spezial/Outdoor-Navigation-mit-dem-Garmin-Colorado-300_1596951.html |archivedate=December 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Other methods include viewing real-time information on a portable computer with internet access or with a Internet-enabled smart phone. The latest advancement of this practice involves installing dedicated applications on a smart phone with a built-in GPS receiver. Seekers can search for and download caches in their immediate vicinity directly to the application and use the on-board GPS receiver to find the cache.\n\nA more controversial version of paperless caching involves mass-downloading only the coordinates and cache names (or waypoint IDs) for hundreds of caches into older receivers. This is a common practice of some cachers and has been used successfully for years. In many cases, however, the cache description and hint are never read by the seeker before hunting the cache. This means they are unaware of potential restrictions such as limited hunt times, park open/close times, off-limit areas, and suggested parking locations.\n\n===Mobile devices===\nThe website geocaching.com<ref>{{cite web|author=${l.c} |url=http://www.geocaching.com/ |title=geocaching.com |publisher=geocaching.com |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> now sells mobile applications which allow users to view caches through a variety of different devices.

Although generally disallowed, hiders could place caches on private property without adequate permission (intentionally or otherwise), which encourages cache finders to trespass. Caches might also be hidden in places where the act of searching can make a finder look suspicious (e.g. near schools, children's playgrounds, banks, courthouses, or in residential neighborhoods), or where the container placement could be mistaken for a [[drug]] stash or a [[bomb]] (especially in urban settings, under bridges,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2011/06/03/police-search-for-gamer-who-hung-geocache-from-railroad-overpass/|title=Police Search For Gamer Who Hung Geocache From Railroad Overpass|date=June 3, 2011|newspaper=The Naperville Sun and CBS Chicago|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}</ref> near banks, courthouses, or embassies).

Hides in these areas are discouraged,<ref name=\"Mike Vogel\" /> and cache listing websites enforce guidelines that disallow certain types of placements. However, as cache reviewers typically cannot see exactly where and how every particular cache is hidden, problematic hides can slip through. Ultimately it is also up to cache finders to use discretion when attempting to search for a cache, and report any problems.\n\nRegional rules for placement of caches have become quite complex. For example, in Virginia,<ref>[https://wiki.groundspeak.com/display/GEO/Virginia Groundspeak's Wiki for Virginia's land management policies], retrieved January 12, 2013</ref> the Virginia Department of Transportation and the Wildlife Management Agency now forbids the placement of geocaches on all land controlled by those agencies.

Technically the dog tag is the \"travel bug\" and the attached object is called the \"hitchhiker\" but everyone calls the combination a Travel Bug. The tracking tags come from Geocaching.com. You add your own traveler. The original concept was, a geocacher picks up a Bug from one geocache (usually just called a 'cache' by geocachers) and leaves it in another(it's how they travel). Travel Bugs have their own page on the website where owners can define a mission for the Bug. For example, the bug in the picture's mission was to go to the moon, but in the mean time to visit every state in the continental U.S. according to a specific pattern. People who move a bug go to the bug's page to record the move using the tracking number on the dog tag. If it's in the bug's mission, and the owner is lucky, their bug can travel all over the world. They're notified of every place it stops and can view any pictures the cacher who moved it might have added.\n\nA while ago the ability was added to \"discover\" Travel Bugs. Now, you can record the tracking number while at the cache the bug is in (picture with cell phone is common) then on its page log that you discovered it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/track/travelbugfaq.aspx |title=Travel Bug\u00ae FAQ\n|last=|first=|date=|website= geocaching.com |publisher=|access-date=2018-06-10}}</ref>\n\n==== Benchmarking ====\nThe website also supports the discovery of [[Benchmarking (geolocating)|benchmarks]] in the USA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/mark/#Whatis |title=Benchmark Hunting |publisher=Geocaching.com |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> There are currently no benchmarks outside the USA in its database.

The Opencaching Network lists the most types of caches, including traditional, virtual, moving, multi, quiz, webcam, BIT, guest book, USB, event and MP3. The Opencaching Network is less restrictive than many sites, and does not charge for the use of the sites, the service being community driven. Some (or all) listings may or may not be required to be reviewed by community volunteers before being published and although cross-listing is permitted, it is discouraged. Some listings are listed on other sites, but there are many that are unique to the Opencaching Network. Features include the ability to organize one's favourite caches, build custom searches, be instantly notified of new caches in one's area, seek and create caches of all types, export GPX queries, statpics, etc. Each Opencaching Node provides the same API for free (called \"OKAPI\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/opencaching/okapi |title=Opencaching Network API |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}</ref>) for use by developers who want to create third-party applications able to use the Opencaching Network's content.\n\nCountries with associated opencaching websites include the United States at www.opencaching.us; Germany at www.opencaching.de;<ref>{{cite book|last=Gr\u00fcndel|first=Markus|title=Geocaching: Basiswissen f\u00fcr Draussen|publisher=Conrad Stein Verlag, GmbH|isbn=3866862725|language=German}}</ref>  Sweden at www.opencaching.se; Poland at www.opencaching.pl; Czech Republic at www.opencaching.cz; Norway at www.opencaching.no; The Netherlands at www.opencaching.nl; Romania at www.opencaching.ro; the United Kingdom at www.opencaching.org.uk.<ref name=\"OpenCaching United States Wiki\">{{cite web|url=http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Main_Page|title=OpenCaching United States Wiki|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe main difference between opencaching and traditional listing sites is that all services are open to the users at no cost. Generally, most geocaching services or websites offer some basic information for free, but users may have to pay for premium membership that allows access to more information or advanced searching capabilities. This is not the case with opencaching; every geocache is listed and accessible to everyone for free.<ref name=\"OpenCaching United States Wiki\"/>\n\nAdditionally, Opencaching sites allow users to rate and report on existing geocaches. This allows users to see what other cachers think of the cache and it encourages participants to place higher quality caches. The rating system also greatly reduces the problem of abandoned or unsatisfactory caches still being listed after repeated negative comments or posts in the cache logs.<ref name=\"OpenCaching United States Wiki\"/>\n\n===OpenCaching.com===\nOpenCaching.com (short: OX) was a site created and run by Garmin from 2010-2015, which had the stated aim of being as free and open as possible with no paid content. Caches were approved by a community process and coordinates were available without an account. The service closed on 14 August 2015.\n\n===Other sites===\nIn many countries there are regional geocaching sites, but these mostly only compile lists of caches in the area from the three main sites. Many of them also accept unique listings of caches for their site, but these listings tend to be less popular than the international sites, although occasionally the regional sites may have more caches than the international sites. There are some exceptions though, e.g. in the former [[Soviet Union]], the site Geocaching[[.su]] remains popular because it accepts listings in the [[Cyrillic script]]. Additional international sites include Geocaching.de, a German website, and Geocaching Australia, which accepts listings of cache types deprecated by geocaching.com, cache types such as TrigPoint and Moveable caches, as well as traditional geocache types.\n\n====GPSgames====\nGPSgames.org is an online community dedicated to all kinds of games involving Global Positioning System receivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsgames.org/content/blogsection/9/59/|title=About GPSgames.org|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> GPSgames.org allows traditional geocaches as well as virtual, locationless, and traveler geocaches. Geodashing, Shutterspot, GeoVexilla, MinuteWar, GeoPoker, and GeoGolf are among the GPS games available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsgames.org/content/section/3/57/|title=GPS Games|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> GPSgames.org has been 100% free since 2001, through donations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsgames.org/|title=GPSgames.org|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====NaviCache====\nNavicache.com started as a regional listing service in 2001.<ref name=\"The Rebirth Of Navicaching\">{{cite web|url=http://www.notaboutthenumbers.com/2012/06/05/the-rebirth-of-navicaching/|title=The Rebirth Of Navicaching|date=June 5, 2012}}</ref> While many of the website's listings have been posted to other sites, it also offers unique listings. The website lists nearly any type of geocache and does not charge to access any of the caches listed in its database. All submissions are reviewed and approved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navicache.com/cgi-bin/db/faq.google2.wap.pl|title=Navicache Geocaching FAQ|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> Navicache is under transition to new owners, who said they \"plan to develop a site that geocachers want, with rules that geocachers think are suitable. Geocaching.com and OX are both backed by large enterprises, and while that means they have more funding and people, we\u2019re a much smaller team \u2013 so our advantage is the ability to be dynamic and listen to the users.\"<ref name=\"The Rebirth Of Navicaching\"/>\n\n====TerraCaching====\nTerracaching.com seeks to provide high-quality caches made so by the difficulty of the hide or from the quality of the location. Membership is managed through a sponsorship system, and each cache is under continual peer review from other members. Terracaching.com embraces virtual caches alongside traditional or multi-stage caches and includes many locationless caches among the thousands of caches in its database. It is increasingly attracting members who like the point system. In Europe, TerraCaching is supported by Terracaching.eu. This site is translated in different European languages, has an extended FAQ and extra supporting tools for TerraCaching. TerraCaching strongly discourages caches that are listed on other sites (so-called double-listing).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terracaching.com/|title=Welcome to TerraCaching.com|accessdate= January 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Augmented reality]]\n* [[Benchmarking (geolocating)]]\n* [[BookCrossing]]\n* [[Dead drop]]\n* [[Degree Confluence Project]]\n* [[Encounter (game)]]\n* [[Geohashing]]\n* [[Ingress (video game)]]\n* [[Location-based game]]\n* [[Munzee]]\n* [[Orienteering]]\n* [[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]\n* [[Puzzlehunt]]\n* [[Questing]]\n* [[Transmitter hunting]]\n* [[Wherigo]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons}}\n{{Commonscat|Groundspeak}}\n* {{cite book|title=The Joy of Geocaching |authors=Paul Gillin and Dana Gillin|publisher=Quill Driver Books|location=Fresno, California|year=2010|ISBN=978-1884956997}}\n* {{cite book|title=The Essential Guide to Geocaching|author=Mike Dyer|publisher=Fulcrum Publishing|date=August 15, 2004|ISBN=978-1555915223}}\n* {{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Geocaching|author=Jack W.

The Canton years saw the evolution of the KMT into a revolutionary movement with a strong military focus and ideological commitment, setting the tone of the KMT rule of China beyond 1927.\n\nIn 1924 the KMT made the momentous decision to ally with the Communist Party and the USSR. With Soviet help, KMT reorganized itself along the Leninist line and adopted a pro-labor and pro-peasant stance. The [[First United Front|Kuomintang-CCP cooperation]] was confirmed in the [[1st National Congress of Kuomintang|First Congress of the KMT]] and the communists were instructed to join the KMT. The allied government set up the [[Peasant Movement Training Institute]] in the city, of which Mao Zedong was a director for one term. Sun and his military commander Chiang used [[USSR|Soviet]] funds and weapons to build an armed force staffed by communist commissars, training its cadres in the [[Whampoa Military Academy]].{{sfnp|Beck|2007}} In August, the fledgling army suppressed the [[Canton Merchants' Corps Uprising]]. The next year the anti-imperialist [[May Thirtieth Movement]] swept the country, and the KMT government called for strikes in Canton and Hong Kong. The tensions of the massive strikes and protests led to the [[Shakee Massacre]].\n\nAfter the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925 the mood was changing in the party toward the communists. In August the left-wing KMT leader [[Liao Zhongkai]] was assassinated and the right-wing leader [[Hu Hanmin]], the suspected mastermind, was exiled to the Soviet Union, leaving the pro-communist [[Wang Jingwei]] in charge. Opposing communist encroachment, the right-wing [[Western Hills Group]] vowed to expel the communists from the KMT. The \"[[Canton Coup]]\" on 20 March 1926 saw Chiang solidify his control over the [[KMT|Nationalists]] and [[National Revolutionary Army|their army]] against [[Wang Jingwei]], the party's left wing, its [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] allies, and its [[USSR|Soviet]] advisors.<ref>{{citation |last=Van de Ven |first=Hans |date=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC |title=War and Nationalism in China: 1925\u20131945 |series=''Studies in the Modern History of Asia'' |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-14571-8 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&pg=PA101 101 ff]}}</ref><ref name=AhXiang1998>{{citation |author=Ah Xiang |contribution-url=http://www.republicanchina.org/Zhongshan-Warship-Incident.pdf |contribution=The ''Zhongshan'' Warship Incident |title=Tragedy of Chinese Revolution |date=1998}}</ref> By May, he had ended civilian control of the military<ref name=AhXiang1998/> and begun his [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] against the [[Warlord Era|warlords]] of the north. Its success led to the split of the KMT between Wuhan and Nanking and the purge of the communists in the [[Shanghai Massacre]]. Immediately afterwards Canton joined the purge under the auspice of [[Li Jishen]],resulting in the arrest of communists and the suspension of left wing KMT apparatuses and labor groups. Later in 1927 when [[Zhang Fakui]], a general supportive of the [[Wuhan Coup|Wuhan faction]] seized Canton and installed Wang Jingwei's faction in the city, the communists saw an opening and launched the [[Guangzhou Uprising]]. Prominent communist military leaders [[Ye Ting]] and [[Ye Jianying]] led the failed defense of the city. Soon, control of the city reverted to [[Li Jishen]].\n\nLi was deposed in the War between Chiang and Guangxi Clique. By 1929, [[Chen Jitang]] had established himself as the powerholder of Guangdong. In 1931 he threw his weight behind the anti-Chiang schism by hosting a separate Nationalist government in Guangzhou.<ref>\u674e\u6d01\u4e4b\uff0c\u9648\u6d4e\u68e0\u4e3b\u7ca4\u59cb\u672b\uff0c\u300a\u5e7f\u5dde\u6587\u53f2\u300b\u7b2c\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u8f91\u3002</ref> Opposing Chiang's alleged dictatorship, the separatists included KMT leaders like [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Sun Fo]] and others from diverse factions. The peace negotiations amidst the armed stand-off led to the [[4th National Congress of Kuomintang]] being held separately by three factions in Nanjing, Shanghai and Canton. Resigning all his posts, Chiang pulled off a political compromise that reunited all factions. While the intraparty division was resolved, Chen kept his power until he was defeated by Chiang in 1936.\n\nDuring [[Second Sino-Japanese War|World War II]], the \"[[Canton Operation]]\" subjected the city to [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] occupation by the end of December 1938.\n\n==== Communist takeover ====\nAmid the closing months of the [[Chinese Civil War]], Guangzhou briefly served as the capital of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] after the taking of [[Nanjing]] by the PLA in April 1949. The [[People's Liberation Army]] entered the city on 14 October 1949. Amid a massive exodus to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Colonial Macau|Macau]], the [[KMT|Nationalists]] blew up the [[Haizhu Bridge]] across the Pearl River in retreat. The Cultural Revolution had a large effect on the city with much of its temples, churches and other monuments destroyed during this chaotic period.\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]] initiated building projects including new housing on the banks of the Pearl River to adjust the city's [[boat people]] to life on land. Since the 1980s, the city's close proximity to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shenzhen]] and its ties to [[overseas Chinese]] have made it one of the first beneficiaries of China's [[opening up policy|opening up]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s have also helped the city's industrialisation and development.\n\nThe municipality was expanded in the year 2000, with [[Huadu District|Huadu]] and [[Panyu District|Panyu]] joining the city as [[district (China)|urban districts]] and [[Conghua]] and [[Zengcheng]] as more rural [[county (China)|counties]]. The former districts of [[Dongshan District, Guangzhou|Dongshan]] and [[Fangcun District|Fangcun]] were abolished in 2005, merged into [[Yuexiu District|Yuexiu]] and [[Liwan District|Liwan]] respectively. The city acquired [[Nansha District|Nansha]] and [[Luogang District|Luogang]]. The former was carved out of [[Panyu District|Panyu]], the latter from parts of [[Baiyun District, Guangzhou|Baiyun]], [[Tianhe District|Tianhe]], [[Zengcheng]], and an exclave within [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Huangpu]]. The [[National People's Congress]] approved a development plan for the [[Pearl River Delta]] in January 2009; on March 19 the same year, the Guangzhou and [[Foshan]] municipal governments agreed to establish a framework to merge the two cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2009-03/19/content_11037051.htm |title=Guangzhou and Foshan signed \"City Merge Cooperation Framework\" |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |accessdate=2010-05-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705135320/http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2009-03/19/content_11037051.htm |archivedate=2009-07-05 |df= }}</ref> In 2014, [[Luogang District|Luogang]] merged into [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Huangpu]] and both [[Conghua District|Conghua]] and [[Zengcheng District|Zengcheng]] counties were upgraded to districts.

Together they broadcast in more than a dozen channels. The primary language of both stations is [[Cantonese]]. Traditionally only one channel of Radio Guangdong is dedicated to [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]]. However, in recent years there has been an increase in Mandarin programmes on most Cantonese channels. Radio stations from cities around Guangzhou mainly broadcast in Cantonese and can be received in different parts of the city, depending on the radio stations' locations and transmission power. The Beijing-based [[China National Radio]] also broadcasts Mandarin programmes in the city. Radio Guangdong has a 30-minute weekly English programme, ''Guangdong Today'', which is broadcast globally through the [[WRN Broadcast|World Radio Network]]. Daily English news programmes are also broadcast by Radio Guangdong.\n\nGuangzhou has some of the best Chinese-language newspapers and magazines in [[mainland China]], most of which are published by three major newspaper groups in the city, the [[Guangzhou Daily]] Press Group, [[Southern Daily|Nanfang Press Corporation]], and the [[Yangcheng Evening News]] Group. The two leading newspapers of the city are ''[[Guangzhou Daily]]'' and ''[[Southern Metropolis Daily]]''. The former, with a circulation of 1.8 million, has been China's most successful newspaper for 14 years in terms of advertising revenue, while ''Southern Metropolis Daily'' is considered one of the most liberal newspapers in mainland China. In addition to Guangzhou's Chinese-language publications, there are a few English magazines and newspapers. The most successful is ''That's Guangzhou'', which started more than a decade ago and has since blossomed into ''[[That's PRD]]'', producing expatriate magazines in Beijing and Shanghai as well. It also produces ''In the Red''.\n\n{{anchor|Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre}}\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:North Square of SYSU.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|[[Sun Yat-sen University]] main gate]]\n[[File:Sun Yat-sen University.JPG|thumb|upright=.9|The College of Medical Science at Sun Yat-sen University]]\n[[File:Guangzhou Library 2013.11.15 18-30-36.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Guangzhou Library]]\nThe [[Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center|Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre]], also known as Guangzhou University Town ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5e7f\u5dde|\u5927\u5b66|\u57ce}}}}), is a large tertiary education complex located in the southeast suburbs of Guangzhou.

Department of Linguistics. [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]]. Leipzig.</ref> also called the '''second case''', is the [[grammatical case]] that marks a word, usually a [[noun]], as modifying another word, also usually a noun.<ref>Dictionary.com, [[genitive]]</ref> A genitive can serve purposes other than indicating relationships other than one noun's relationship to another noun; for example, some [[verb]]s may feature [[argument (linguistics)|arguments]] in the genitive case, and it may also have [[adverb]]ial uses (see [[adverbial genitive]]).\n\n[[Genitive construction]] includes the genitive case, but is a broader category. Placing a modifying noun in the genitive case is one way of indicating that it is related to a [[head noun]], in a genitive construction. However, there are other ways to indicate a genitive construction.  For example, many [[Afroasiatic languages]] place the head noun (rather than the modifying noun) in the [[construct state]].\n\n[[Possessive]] grammatical constructions, including the '''possessive case''', may be regarded as a subset of genitive construction. For example, the genitive construction \"[[Pack (canine)|pack of dogs]]\" is similar, but not identical in meaning to the possessive case \"dogs' pack\" (and neither of these is entirely interchangeable with \"dog pack\", which is neither genitive nor possessive). [[Modern English]] is an example of a language that has a possessive case rather than a ''conventional'' genitive case. That is, Modern English indicates a genitive construction with either the possessive [[clitic]] suffix \"[[Saxon genitive|-{{'s}}]]\", or a [[preposition]]al genitive construction such as \"x of y\". However, some irregular English pronouns do have possessive forms which may more commonly be described as genitive (see [[English possessive]]).\n\nMany languages have a genitive case, including [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Latin]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Kannada Language|Kannada]], [[Tamil Language|Tamil]], [[Telugu Language|Telugu]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and all [[Slavic languages]] except [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]].\n\n==Functions of the genitive case==\nDepending on the language, specific varieties of genitive-noun\u2013main-noun relationships may include:\n* [[possession (linguistics)|possession]] (''see'' [[possessive case]], [[possessed case]]):\n** [[inalienable possession]] (\"''Janet\u2019s'' height\", \"''Janet\u2019s'' existence\", \"''Janet\u2019s'' long fingers\")\n** [[alienable possession]] (\"''Janet\u2019s'' jacket\", \"''Janet\u2019s'' drink\")\n** relationship indicated by the noun being modified (\"''Janet\u2019s'' husband\")\n* composition (''see'' [[Partitive]]):\n** substance (\"a wheel ''of cheese''\")\n** elements (\"a group ''of men''\")\n** source (\"a portion ''of the food''\")\n* participation in an action:\n** as an [[agent (grammar)|agent]] (\"She benefited from ''her father's'' love\")&nbsp;\u2013 this is called the ''subjective genitive'' (Compare \"Her father loved her\", where ''Her father'' is the ''subject''.)\n** as a [[Patient (grammar)|patient]] (\"the love ''of music''\") &nbsp;\u2013 this is called the ''objective genitive'' (Compare \"She loves music\", where ''music'' is the ''object''.)\n* origin (\"men ''of Rome''\")\n* reference (\"the capital ''of the Republic''\" '''or''' \"''the Republic's'' capital\")\n* description (\"man ''of honour''\", \"day ''of reckoning''\")\n* compounds (\"''dooms''day\" (\"doom's day\"), [[Scottish Gaelic]] \"''ball coise''\" = \"football\", where \"''coise''\" = gen. of \"''cas''\", \"foot\")\n* [[Apposition#Appositive genitive|apposition]] ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] \u3075\u3058\u306e\u5c71 (''Fuji no Yama''), \"Mount Fuji\"; [[Latin]] ''urbs Romae'' (\"city of Rome\"))\nDepending on the language, some of the relationships mentioned above have their own distinct cases different from the genitive.\n\n[[Possessive pronoun]]s are distinct pronouns, found in Indo-European languages such as English, that function like pronouns inflected in the genitive. They are considered separate pronouns if contrasting to languages where pronouns are regularly inflected in the genitive. For example, English ''my'' is either a separate [[possessive adjective]] or an irregular genitive of ''I'', while in Finnish, for example, ''minun'' is regularly [[agglutination|agglutinated]] from ''minu-'' \"I\" and ''-n'' (genitive).\n\nIn some languages, nouns in the genitive case also [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in case with the nouns they modify (that is, it is marked for two cases). This phenomenon is called [[suffixaufnahme]].\n\nIn some languages, nouns in the genitive case may be found in [[inclusio]]&nbsp;\u2013 that is, between the main noun\u2019s [[article (grammar)|article]] and the noun itself.\n\n==Chinese==\n===Cantonese===\nThe particle \u5605 (''ge'') or the possessed noun's classifier is used to denote possession for singular nouns, while the particle \u5572 (''d\u012b'') is used for plural nouns.\n\nExamples:\n* \u7238\u7238\u5605\u5c4b\u4f01  ''b\u0101 b\u0101 ge \u016bk k\u00e9i'' (father's house/home)\n* \u6211\u9593\u5c4b ''ng\u00f3h g\u0101an \u016bk'' (my house)\n* \u4fc2\u4f62\u5572\u66f8.  ''haih k\u00e9uih di shyu''  (It's his books.)\n\n===Hokkien===\nThe [[Hokkien]] possessive is constructed by using the suffix ''\u00ea'' (\u7684 or \u4e2a or \u516e) to make the genitive case. For example:\n:Nominative: ''th\u00e2u-ke'' \u982d\u5bb6 (\"boss\"); ''chhia'' \u8eca (\"car\")\n:Genitive: ''th\u00e2u-ke \u00ea chhia'' (\"boss's car\")\nIt also uses the suffix ''chi'' (\u4e4b) for [[Classical Chinese|classical]] or official cases. For example:\n:''Kun put ki\u00e0n H\u00f4ng-h\u00f4 chi s\u00fai thian-si\u014dng l\u00e2i?'' \u541b\u4e0d\u898b\u9ec3\u6cb3\u4e4b\u6c34\u5929\u4e0a\u4f86 (\"Don't you see the water of [[Yellow River]] falls down from the sky?\")\nSome of the Hokkien singular pronouns play the roles of [[possessive determiner]]s with their [[nasalized]] forms. For example: (see [[Hokkien pronouns]])\n:Pronoun: ''g\u00f3a'' (I), ''l\u00ed'' (you), ''i'' (he, she or it)\n:Genitive: ''go\u00e1n tau'' (\"my home\"), ''l\u00edn tau'' (\"your house\"), ''in tau'' (\"his home\" or \"her home\")\nStill, suffix ''\u00ea'' is available for pronouns to express the genitive. For example:\n:Pronoun: ''g\u00f3a'' (I), ''l\u00ed'' (you), ''i'' (he, she or it)\n:Genitive: ''g\u00f3a-\u00ea'' (my), ''l\u00ed-\u00ea'' (your), ''i-\u00ea'' (his, her or its)\n\n===Mandarin===\nIn Mandarin Chinese, the genitive case is made by use of the particle \u7684 (de).\n\nFor instance: \u6211\u7684\u732b ''w\u01d2 de m\u0101o'' (my cat).\n\nHowever, about persons in relation to one's self, \u7684 is often dropped when the context allows for it to be easily understood.\n\nFor instance: \u6211\u5988\u5988 ''w\u01d2 m\u0101m\u0101'' and \u6211\u7684\u5988\u5988 ''w\u01d2 de m\u0101m\u0101'' both mean \"my mother\".\n\n== English ==\n{{Details|English possessive}}\n\n[[Old English grammar|Old English]] had a genitive case, which has left its mark in modern English in the form of the possessive ending '''s'' (now sometimes referred to as the \"Saxon genitive\"), as well as possessive pronoun forms such as ''his'', ''theirs'', etc., and in certain words derived from [[adverbial genitive]]s such as ''once'' and ''afterwards''. (Other Old English case markers have generally disappeared completely.) The modern English possessive forms are not normally considered to represent a grammatical case, although they are sometimes referred to as genitives or as belonging to a [[possessive case]]. One of the reasons that the status of ''s'' as a case ending is often rejected is that it doesn't behave as such, but rather as a clitic marking that indicates that a dependency relationship exists between phrases. You can say ''the Queen\u2019s dress'', but also ''the Queen of England\u2019s dress'', where the genitive marker is completely separated from the actual possessor. If it were a genitive case as many other languages have (including Old English), one would expect something like ''*the Queen\u2019s of England dress'' or, to emulate languages with a single consistent genitive case, ''*the England\u2019s queen\u2019s dress''.\n\n==Finnic genitives and accusatives==\n[[Finnic languages]] ([[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]]) have genitive cases.\n\nIn Finnish, prototypically the genitive is marked with ''-n'', e.g. ''maa&nbsp;\u2013 maan'' \"country&nbsp;\u2013 of the country\". The stem may change, however, with [[consonant gradation]] and other reasons. For example, in certain words ending in consonants, ''-e-'' is added, e.g. ''mies&nbsp;\u2013 miehen'' \"man&nbsp;\u2013 of the man\", and in some, but not all words ending in ''-i'', the ''-i'' is changed to an ''-e-'', to give ''-en'', e.g.  ''lumi&nbsp;\u2013 lumen'' \"snow&nbsp;\u2013 of the snow\". The genitive is used extensively, with animate and inanimate possessors. In addition to the genitive, there is also a [[partitive case]] (marked ''-ta/-t\u00e4'' or ''-a/-\u00e4'') used for expressing that something is a part of a larger mass, e.g. ''joukko miehi\u00e4'' \"a group of men\".\n\nIn Estonian, the genitive marker ''-n'' has elided with respect to Finnish. Thus, the genitive always ends with a vowel, and the singular genitive is sometimes (in a subset of words ending with a vocal in nominative) identical in form to nominative.\n\nIn Finnish, in addition to the uses mentioned above, there is a construct where the genitive is used to mark a surname. For example, ''Juhani Virtanen'' can be also expressed ''Virtasen Juhani'' (\"Juhani of the Virtanens\").\n\nA complication in Finnic languages is that the [[accusative case]] ''-(e)n'' is homophonic to the genitive case. This case does not indicate possession, but is a syntactic marker for the object, additionally indicating that the action is [[Telicity|telic]] (completed). In [[Estonian language|Estonian]], it is often said that only a \"genitive\" exists. However, the cases have completely different functions, and the form of the accusative has developed from *''-(e)m''. (The same sound change has developed into a synchronic mutation of a final ''m'' into ''n'' in Finnish, e.g. genitive ''syd\u00e4men'' vs. nominative ''syd\u00e4n''.) This homophony has exceptions in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], where a separate accusative ''-(e)t'' is found in pronouns, e.g. ''kenet'' \"who (telic object)\", vs. ''kenen'' \"whose\".\n\nA difference is also observed in some of the related [[Sami languages|S\u00e1mi languages]], where the pronouns and the plural of nouns in the genitive and accusative are easily distinguishable from each other, e.g., ''ku\u00e4'c\u01e9\u01e9mi'' \"eagles' (genitive plural)\" and ''ku\u00e4'c\u01e9\u01e9mid'' \"eagles (accusative plural)\" in [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]].\n\n==German==\n\n=== Formation ===\n\n==== Articles ====\nThe genitive singular definite article for masculine and neuter nouns is ''des'', while the feminine and plural definite article is ''der''. The indefinite articles are ''eines'' for masculine and neuter nouns, and ''einer'' for feminine and plural nouns (although the bare form cannot be used in the plural, it manifests in ''keiner'', ''meiner'', etc.)\n\n==== Nouns ====\nSingular masculine and neuter nouns of the strong declension in the genitive case are marked with ''-(e)s''. Generally, one-syllable nouns favour the ''-es'' ending, and it is obligatory with nouns ending with a sibilant such as ''s'' or ''z''. Otherwise, a simple ''-s'' ending is usual. Feminine and plural nouns remain uninflected:\n* des Beitrag'''s''' (of the contribution) \u2013 masculine\n* der Blume (of the flower) \u2013 feminine\n* des Land'''es''' (of the country) \u2013 neuter\n* der B\u00e4ume (of the trees) \u2013 plural\nSingular masculine nouns (and one neuter noun) of the weak declension are marked with an ''-(e)n'' (or rarely ''-(e)ns'') ending in the genitive case:\n* des Rabe'''n''' (of the raven) \u2013 masculine\n* des Herz'''ens''' (of the heart) \u2013 neuter\n\n==== Adjectives ====\nThe declension of adjectives in the genitive case is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n!Plural\n|-\n|With definite article\n| -en\n| -en\n| -en\n| -en\n|-\n|With indefinite article\n| -en\n| -en\n| -en\n| -en\n|-\n|With no article\n| -en\n| -er\n| -en\n| -er\n|}\n\n==== Personal pronouns ====\nThe genitive personal pronouns are quite rare and either very formal, literary or outdated, they are as follows (with comparison to the nominative pronouns):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Nominative\n!Genitive\n|-\n|ich (I)\n|meiner\n|-\n|du (you sg.)\n|deiner\n|-\n|er (he)\n|seiner\n|-\n|wir (we)\n|unser\n|-\n|ihr (you pl.)\n|euer\n|-\n|Sie (you for. pl.)\n|Ihrer\n|-\n|sie (she/they)\n|ihrer\n|}\nSome examples:\n* W\u00fcrden Sie statt ''meiner'' gehen? (Would you go instead ''of me''?)\n* Wir sind ''ihrer'' nicht w\u00fcrdig (We are not worthy ''of her/them'')\n* Ich werde ''euer'' gedenken (I will commemorate ''you'')\n\n==== Relative pronouns ====\nUnlike the personal ones, the genitive relative pronouns are in regular use and are as follows (with comparison to the nominative relative pronouns):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Nominative\n!Genitive\n|-\n|Masculine\n|der\n|dessen\n|-\n|Feminine\n|die\n|deren\n|-\n|Neuter\n|das\n|dessen\n|-\n|Plural\n|die\n|deren\n|}\nSome examples:\n* Kennst du den Sch\u00fcler, ''dessen'' Mutter eine Hexe ist? (Do you know the student ''whose'' mother is a witch?) \u2013 masculine\n* Sie ist die Frau, ''deren'' Mann Rennfahrer ist (She is the woman ''whose'' husband is a racer) \u2013 feminine\n\n=== Usage ===\n\n==== Nouns ====\nThe genitive case is often used to show possession or the relation between nouns:\n*die Farbe ''des'' ''Himmels'' (the colour ''of the'' ''sky'')\n*Deutschland liegt im Herzen ''Europas'' (Germany lies in the heart ''of Europe'')\n*der Tod ''seiner Frau'' (the death ''of his wife'')\n*die Entwicklung ''dieser L\u00e4nder'' (the development ''of these countries'')\nA simple ''s'' is added to the end of a name:\n*''Claudias'' Buch (''Claudia's'' book)\n\n==== Prepositions ====\nThe genitive case is also commonly found after certain prepositions:\n* innerhalb ''eines Tages'' (within ''a day'')\n* statt ''des'' ''Hemdes'' (instead ''of the shirt'')\n* w\u00e4hrend ''unserer'' ''Abwesenheit'' (during ''our absence'')\n* jenseits ''der Berge'' (beyond ''the mountains'')\n\n==== Adjectives ====\nThe genitive case can sometimes be found in connection with certain adjectives:\n* Wir sind uns ''dessen'' bewusst (We are aware ''of that'')\n* Er ist ''des Diebstahls'' schuldig (He is guilty ''of the theft'')\n* Das Kind ist ''der Ruhe'' bed\u00fcrftig (The child is in need ''of the calmness'')\n* Ich werde ''dieses Lebens'' \u00fcberdr\u00fcssig (I am growing weary ''of this life'')\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThe genitive case is occasionally found in connection with certain verbs (some of which require an accusative before the genitive); they are mostly either formal or legal:\n* Die Stadt erfreut sich ''eines g\u00fcnstigen Klimas'' (The city enjoys ''a favourable climate'')\n* Gedenken Sie ''der Toten'' des Krieges (Remember ''those who died'' in the war)\n* Wer klagte ihn ''des Mordes'' an? (Who accused him ''of the murder''?)\n* Man verd\u00e4chtigt euch ''des Betrugs'' (Someone suspects you ''of (committing) fraud'')\n\n==Greek==\nThe [[ablative case]] of Indo-European was absorbed into the genitive in Classical Greek.<ref>{{cite book|author=Herbert Weir Smyth|title=Greek Grammar|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1956}}, page 313 and elsewhere</ref> This added to the usages of the \"genitive proper\", the usages of the \"ablatival genitive\". The genitive occurs with verbs, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions.\n\n==Japanese==\nThe Japanese possessive is constructed by using the suffix ''-no'' \u301c\u306e to make the genitive case. For example:\n:Nominative: \u732b ''neko'' ('cat'); \u624b ''te'' ('hand, paw')\n:Genitive: \u732b\u306e\u624b ''neko-no te'' ('cat's paw')\nIt also uses the suffix ''-na'' \u301c\u306a for [[Adjectival noun (Japanese)|adjectival noun]]; in some analyses adjectival nouns are simply nouns that take ''-na'' in the genitive, forming a [[complementary distribution]] (''-no'' and ''-na'' being [[allomorph]]s).\n\nThe archaic genitive case particle ''-ga'' is still retained in certain expressions and place names.\n\nTypically, languages have nominative case nouns converting into genitive case. It has been found, however, that Japanese will in rare cases allow accusative case to convert to genitive, if specific conditions are met in the clause in which the conversion appears. This is referred to as \"Accusative-Genitive conversion.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shin\u2019ya|first=Asano|author2=Hiroyuki Una|title=Mood and Case: with special reference to genitive Case conversion in Kansai Japanese.|journal=Journal of East Asian Linguistics|date=February 2010|volume=19|issue=1|pages=37\u201359|doi=10.1007/s10831-009-9055-y}}</ref>\n\n==Korean==\nThe genitive in Korean can be formed using the particle ''-ui'' '\uc758', although this particle is normally elided in Modern Korean, which leaves the genitive unmarked. (If not, it is usually pronounced ''-e'' '\uc5d0') Only some personal pronouns retain a distinctive genitive which comes from the amalgamation of the pronoun plus ''-ui'' '\uc758' \n\n:This is a car.

Latin genitives still have certain modern scientific uses:\n*[[Binomial nomenclature|Scientific names]] of living things sometimes contain genitives, as in the plant name ''[[Buddleja davidii]]'', meaning \"David's buddleia\". Here ''Davidii'' is the genitive of ''Davidius'', a [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinized]] version of the English name. It is not capitalized because it is the second part of a binomial name.\n*Names of astronomical constellations are Latin, and the genitives of their names are used in naming objects in those constellations, as in the [[Bayer designation]] of stars. For example, the brightest star in the constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] is called ''Alpha Virginis'', which is to say \"Alpha of Virgo\", as ''virginis'' is the genitive of ''virg\u014d''. Note that plural forms and adjectives also decline accordingly: plural ''Alpha Piscium'' ([[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]]) and ''Alpha Canum Venaticorum'' ([[Canes Venatici]]) versus singular ''Alpha Piscis Austrini'' ([[Piscis Austrinus]]) and ''Alpha Canis Majoris'' ([[Canis Major]]). Astronomy manuals often list the genitive forms, as some are easy to get wrong even with a basic knowledge of Latin, e.g. [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]], which is a neuter plural not a feminine singular: ''Delta Velorum'' not *''Delta Velae''.\n* ''[[Modus operandi]]'', which can be translated to English as \"mode of operation\", in which ''operandi'' is a singular genitive [[gerund]] (i.e. \"of operation\"), not a plural of ''operandus'' as is sometimes mistakenly assumed.\n\n==Irish==\n{{misleading|section|date=October 2013}}\nThe [[Irish language]] also uses a genitive case (''tuiseal ginideach''). For example, in the phrase ''bean an t\u00ed'' (woman of the house), ''t\u00ed'' is the genitive case of ''teach'', meaning \"house\". Another example is ''barr an chnoic'', \"top of the hill\", where ''cnoc'' means \"hill\", but is changed to ''chnoic'', which also incorporates [[lenition]].\n\n==Persian==\n{{main|Ez\u0101fe}}\n[[Old Persian]] had a true genitive case inherited from [[Proto-Indo-European]]. By the time of [[Middle Persian]], the genitive case had been lost and replaced by an analytical construction which is now called [[Ez\u0101fe]]. This construction was inherited by [[New Persian]], and was also later borrowed into numerous other [[Iranian Languages|Iranic]], [[Turkic Languages|Turkic]] and [[Indo-Aryan Languages|Indo-Aryan]] languages of Western and South Asia.\n\n==Semitic languages==\n\nGenitive case marking existed in [[Proto-Semitic]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], and [[Ugaritic]]. It indicated possession, and it is preserved today only in [[Arabic]].\n\n===Akkadian===\n:Nominative: ''\u0161arrum'' (king)\n:Genitive: ''a\u0161\u0161at \u0161arrim'' (wife of king = king's wife)\n\n===Arabic===\nCalled \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0631\u0648\u0631 ''al-majr\u016br'' (meaning \"dragged\") in Arabic, the Genitive case functions both as an indication of ownership (ex. the door '''of the house''') and for nouns following a preposition.\n\n:Nominative: \u064c\u0628\u064a\u062a ''baytun'' (a house)\n:Genitive: \u064d\u0628\u0627\u0628\u064f \u0628\u064a\u062a ''b\u0101bu baytin'' (the door of a house) \u0650\u0628\u0627\u0628\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a ''b\u0101bu l-bayti'' (the door of the house)\n\nThe Arabic genitive marking also appears after prepositions.\n:e.g. \u064d\u0628\u0627\u0628\u064c \u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a ''b\u0101bun li-baytin'' (a door '''for''' a house)\n\nThe Semitic genitive should not be confused with the pronominal possessive suffixes that exist in all the Semitic languages\n\n:e.g. Arabic \u0628\u064a\u062a\u064a ''bayt-\u012b'' (my house) \u064e\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u064f\u0643 ''kit\u0101bu-ka'' (your [masc.] book).\n\n==Slavic languages==\n\nWith the exception of Bulgarian and Macedonian, all [[Slavic languages]] decline the nouns and adjectives in accordance with the genitive case using a variety of endings depending on the word's [[word class|lexical category]], its gender, and number (singular or plural).\n\n===Possessives===\nTo indicate possession the ending of the noun indicating the possessor changes depending on the word's ending in the nominative case. \nFor example, to ''a, u, i or y'' in Polish, ''\u0430, \u044f, \u044b or \u0438'' in Russian, and similar cases in other Slavic languages.\n\n:Nominative: (pol.) \"Oto Anton\" / (rus.) \"\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\" (\"Here is Anton\").\n:Genitive: (pol.) \"Oto obiad Anton'''\u0430'''\" / (rus.) \"\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0443\u0436\u0438\u043d \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d'''\u0430'''\" (\"Here is Anton's dinner\").\n\nPossessives can also be formed by the construction (pol.) \"u [subject] jest [object]\" / (rus.) \"\u0423 [subject] \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c [object]\".\n\n:Nominative: (pol.) \"Oto Sergiusz\" / (rus.) \"\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439\" (\"Here is Sergei\").\n:Genitive: (pol.) \"u Sergiusz'''\u0430''' jest obiad / (rus.) \"\u0423 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435'''\u044f''' \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\" (\"Sergei has a dinner\", literally: \"(There) is a dinner at Sergei's\").\n\nIn sentences where the possessor includes an associated pronoun, the pronoun also changes:\n\n:Nominative: (pol.) Oto m\u00f3j brat / (rus.) \"\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\" (\"Here is my brother\").\n:Genitive: (pol.) \"u moj'''ego''' brat'''\u0430''' jest obiad / (rus.) \"\u0423 \u043c\u043e'''\u0435\u0433\u043e''' \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442'''\u0430''' \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\" (\"My brother has a dinner\", literally: \"(There) is a dinner at my_brother's).\n\nAnd in sentences denoting negative possession, the ending of the object noun also changes:\n\n:Nominative: (pol.) \"Oto Irena\" / (rus.) \"\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\" (\"Here is Irene\").\n:Genitive: (pol.) \"Irena nie ma obiad'''u''' (\"Irene does not have a dinner\") or (pol.) \"u Iren'''y''' nie ma obiad'''u''' (\"There is no dinner at Irene's\") \nNote that the Polish phrase \"nie ma [object]\" can work both as a negation of having [object] or a negation of an existence of [object], \nbut the meaning of the two sentences and its structure is different. (In the first case [subject] is Irene, and in the second case [subject] is virtual, it is \"the space\" at Irene's place, not Irene herself)\n:Genitive: (rus.) \"\u0423 \u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d'''\u044b''' \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434'''\u0430'''\" (\"Irine does not have a dinner\", literally: \"(There) is no dinner at Irene's\"). \nNote that the Russian word \"\u043d\u0435\u0442\" is a contraction of \"\u043d\u0435\" + \"\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\". \nIn Russian there is no distinction between [subject] not having an [object] and [object] not being present at [subject]'s.<!-- WRONG. \"\u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0430\" can be used as well -->\n\n===To express negation===\nThe genitive case is also used in sentences expressing negation, even when no possessive relationship is involved. The ending of the subject noun changes just as it does in possessive sentences. The genitive, in this sense, can only be used to negate nominative, accusative and genitive sentences, and not other cases.\n\n:Nominative: (pol.) \"(Czy) Maria jest w domu?\" / (rus.) \"\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430?\" (\"Is Maria at home?\").\n:Genitive: (pol.) \"Mari'''i''' nie ma w domu\" (\"Maria is not at home\", literally: \"[virtual subject] has no Maria at home\")\n:Genitive: (rus.) \"\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438'''\u0438''' \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430\" (\"Maria is not at home\", literally: \"Of Maria there is none at home.\").\n\n:Accusative: (pol.) \"Mog\u0119 rozczyta\u0107 Twoje pismo\" / (rus.) \u041c\u043e\u0433\u0443 (\u043f\u0440\u043e)\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0430\u0448 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043a  (\"I can read your hand writing\")\n:Genitive: (pol.) \"Nie mog\u0119 rozczyta\u0107 Twoj'''ego''' pism'''a'''\" / (rus.) \"\u041d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 (\u043f\u0440\u043e)\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0430\u0448'''\u0435\u0433\u043e''' \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043a'''\u0430'''\" (\"I can't read your handwriting\")\n\nUse of genitive for negation is obligatory in [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Old Church Slavonic]]. The East Slavic languages ([[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]],  and [[Belorussian language|Belorussian]]) employ either the accusative or genitive for negation, albeit the genitive is more commonly used. In [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], negating with the genitive case is perceived as rather archaic and the accusative is preferred, but genitive negation in these languages is still not uncommon, especially in music and literature.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/11298/1/salt_17_kagan.pdf |title=Property-Denoting NPs and Non-Canonical Genitive Case |author=Olga Kagan  |publisher=CLC Publications, Cornell University |work=Proceedings of the 17th Semantics and Linguistic Theory conference |year=2007 |accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Partial direct object===\nThe genitive case is used with some verbs and [[mass noun]]s to indicate that the action covers only a part of the direct object (having a function of non-existing partitive case), whereas similar constructions using the [[Accusative case]] denote full coverage. Compare the sentences:\n\n:Genitive: (pol.) \"Napi\u0142em si\u0119 wod'''y'''\" / (rus.) \"\u042f \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0432\u043e\u0434'''\u044b'''\" (\"I drank water,\" i.e. \"I drank some water, part of the water available\")\n:Accusative: (pol.) \"Wypi\u0142em wod'''\u0119'''\" / (rus.) \"\u042f \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0432\u043e\u0434'''\u0443''' (\"I drank '''the''' water,\" i.e. \"I drank all the water, all the water in question\")\n\nIn Russian, special [[partitive case]] or sub-case is observed for some uncountable nouns which in some contexts have preferred alternative form on -\u0443/\u044e instead of standard genitive on -\u0430/\u044f: \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0447\u0430'''\u044e''' ('drank some tea'), but \u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430 \u0447\u0430'''\u044f''' ('sorts of tea').\n\n===Prepositional constructions===\nThe genitive case is also used in many prepositional constructions. (Usually when some movement or change of state is involved, and when describing the source / destination of the movement. Sometimes also when describing the manner of acting.) \n*Czech prepositions using genitive case: od (from), z, ze (from), do (into), bez (without), krom\u011b (excepting), m\u00edsto (instead of), podle (after, according to), pod\u00e9l (along), okolo (around), u (near, by), vedle (beside), b\u011bhem (during), pomoc\u00ed (using, by the help of), stran (as regards) etc.\n*Polish prepositions using genitive case: od (from), z, ze (from), do, w (into), na (onto), bez (without), zamiast (instead of), wedle (after, according to), wzd\u0142u\u017c (along), oko\u0142o (around), u (near, by), ko\u0142o (beside), podczas (during), etc.\n*Russian prepositions using genitive case: \u043e\u0442 (from), \u0441, \u0441\u043e (from), \u0434\u043e (before, up to), \u0431\u0435\u0437 (without), \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 (excepting), \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e (instead of), \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 (after), \u0432\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044c (along), \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e (around), \u0443 (near, by), \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f (during), \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0447\u0451\u0442 (regarding), etc.\n\n==Turkish==\n\nThe Turkish possessive is constructed using two suffixes: a genitive case for the possessor and a [[possessive suffix]] for the possessed object. For example:\n:Nominative: ''Kad\u0131n'' ('woman'); ''ayakkab\u0131'' ('shoe')\n:Genitive: ''Kad\u0131n\u0131n ayakkab\u0131s\u0131'' ('the woman's shoe')\n\n==Albanian==\n\nThe genitive in Albanian is formed with the help of clitics. For example:\n\n:Nominative: ''lib\u00ebr'' ('book'); ''vajz\u00eb'' ('girl'); \n:Genitive: ''libri i vajz\u00ebs'' (the girl's book)\n\nIf the possessed object is masculine, the clitic is ''i''. If the possessed object is feminine, the clitic is ''e''. If the possessed object is plural, the clitic is ''e'' regardless of the gender.\n\nThe genitive is used with some prepositions: ''me an\u00eb'' ('by means of'), ''nga ana'' ('on behalf of', 'from the side of'), ''p\u00ebr arsye'' ('due to'), ''p\u00ebr shkak'' ('because of'), ''me p\u00ebrjashtim'' ('with the exception of'), ''n\u00eb vend'' ('instead of').\n\n==Kannada==\n\nIn Kannada, the genitive case-endings are:\n\nfor masculine or feminine nouns ending in \"\u0c85\" (a): \u0ca8 (na)\n* Examples: ''s\u016brya-na'' ('of the sun')\n\nfor neuter nouns ending in \"\u0c85\" (a): \u0ca6 (da)\n* Examples: ''mara-da'' ('of the tree')\n\nfor all nouns ending in \"\u0c87\" (i), \"\u0c88\" (\u012b), \"\u0c8e\" (e), or \"\u0c8f\" (\u0113): \u0c85 (a)\n* Examples: ''mane-y-a'' ('of the house'; note that a linking \"y\" is added between the stem and the suffix)\n\nfor all nouns ending in \"\u0c89\" (u), \"\u0c8a\" (\u016b), \"\u0c8b\" (r\u0325), or \"\u0ce0\" (r\u0325\u0304): \u0c87\u0ca8 (ina)\n* Examples; ''guru-v-ina'' ('of the teacher'; note that a linking \"v\" is added between the stem and the suffix)\n\nMost postpositions in Kannada take the genitive case.\n\n==Tamil==\n\nIn Tamil, the genetive case ending is the word \u0b89\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf which signifies possession \nDepending on the last letter of the noun, the genitive case endings may vary \n\nIf the Last Letter is a Consonant, (\u0bae\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bcd \u0b8e\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1) like \u0b95\u0bcd, \u0b99\u0bcd, \u0b9a\u0bcd, \u0b9e\u0bcd, \u0b9f\u0bcd, \u0ba3\u0bcd, \u0ba4\u0bcd, \u0ba8\u0bcd, \u0baa\u0bcd, \u0bae\u0bcd, \u0baf\u0bcd, \u0bb0\u0bcd, \u0bb2\u0bcd, \u0bb5\u0bcd, \u0bb4\u0bcd then the suffix \u0b89\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf gets added \n*Examples : His : \u0b85\u0bb5\u0ba9\u0bcd + \u0b89\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf = \u0b85\u0bb5\u0ba9\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf, Doctor's : \u0bae\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd + \u0b89\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf = \u0bae\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf, Kumar's : \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd + \u0b89\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf = \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf\n\n==See also==\n*[[Genitive construction]]\n*[[Possessive case]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.deutsched.com/Grammar/Lessons/0205genitive.php German genitive case] A lesson covering the genitive case in the German language\n*Russian genitive: [https://web.archive.org/web/20100326035743/http://www.russian-plus.com/Cases/genitive-case.html], [http://www.russianlessons.net/grammar/nouns_genative.php], [https://web.archive.org/web/20101226014532/http://www.learnrussian.net/learn-russian-genitive-case.html]\n* [http://arabic.tripod.com/GenitiveConstruction.htm Genitive Case In Arabic]\n\n{{Grammatical cases}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Genitive Case}}\n[[Category:Grammatical cases]]\n[[Category:Genitive construction]]", "sha1": "quag9n6kf637lochb6vwzu3zdo1273d"}}, {"title": "Gematria", "ns": "0", "id": "12541", "revision": {"id": "863885198", "parentid": "863062132", "timestamp": "2018-10-13T18:20:42Z", "contributor": {"ip": "80.72.94.110"}, "comment": "chronology", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Gematria''' {{IPAc-en|g|\u0259|\u02c8|m|e\u026a|t|r|i|\u0259}} ({{lang-he-n|\u05d2\u05de\u05d8\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0}} {{hebrew|\u05d2\u05d9\u05de\u05d8\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4}}, plural {{hebrew|\u05d2\u05de\u05d8\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea}} or {{hebrew|\u05d2\u05de\u05d8\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea}}, ''gematriot'')<ref name=JE /> is one of several methods of assigning a [[number|numerical value]] to a name, word or phrase based on its letters. \n\nGematria originated as an Assyro-Babylonian-Greek system of alphanumeric [[code]] or [[cipher]] that was later adopted into [[Jewish culture]]. People who practice gematria believe that words with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other or to the number itself. The number may apply to [[Nature]], a person's age, the calendar year, or the like.{{CN|date=August 2018}} A single word can yield multiple values depending on the method used.\n\nSimilar systems have been used in other languages and cultures: earlier, the Greek [[isopsephy]], and later, derived from or inspired by Hebrew gematria, Arabic [[abjad numerals]], and English gematria. A well-known example of Hebrew gematria is the word ''[[Chai (symbol)|chai]]'' (\"alive\"), which is composed of two letters that (using the assignments in the ''Mispar gadol'' table shown below) add up to 18. This has made 18 a \"[[luck#Numerology|lucky number]]\" among the Jewish people. Gifts of money in multiples of 18 are very popular.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chabad.org Chani Benjaminson|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/484894/jewish/What-is-the-reason-giving-money-in-multiples-of-18.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nAlthough the term is [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]], it may be derived from the [[Greek Language|Greek]] \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 ''ge\u014dmetri\u0101'', \"[[geometry]]\", which was used as a translation of g\u0113ma\u1e6driy\u0101, though some scholars believe it to derive from Greek \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 ''grammateia'' \"knowledge of [[writing]]\". It's possible that both Greek words had an influence on the formation of the Hebrew word.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=gematria&r=66 \"Gematria\" at Dictionary.com]</ref><ref>{{OED|gematria}} ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref><ref name=JE /> Some also hold it to derive from the order of the [[Greek alphabet]], gamma being the third letter of the Greek alphabet.<ref>Benjamin Blech, \"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Jewish Culture\", p. 395 (2004)</ref>  \n\nThe word has been extant in English since the 17th century from translations of works by [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]]. Although ostensibly derived from Greek, it is largely used in Jewish texts, notably in those associated with the [[Kabbalah]]. The term does not appear in the [[Hebrew Bible]] itself.<ref name=JE />\n\n==History==\nSome identify two forms of gematria: the \"revealed\" form, which is prevalent in many hermeneutic methods found throughout [[Rabbinic literature]], and the \"mystical\" form, a largely [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] practice.<ref>e.g. Aish HaTorah, http://www.aish.com/spirituality/prayer/Prayer_6_-_Hear_O_Israel_Part_1.asp, which says \"It is part of a Kabbalistic tradition ... Gematria is a Kabbalistic way of showing how two ideas are related on a conceptual level; it is using numerology as a basis to confirm (not create) the connection.\"</ref>\n\nThough gematria is most often used to calculate the values of individual words, [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|psukim]] (Biblical verses), [[Talmud]]ical aphorisms, sentences from the standard [[Jewish liturgy|Jewish prayers]], personal, angelic and Godly names, and other religiously significant material, Kabbalists use them often for arbitrary phrases and, occasionally, for various languages. A few instances of gematria in Arabic, Spanish and Greek, spelled with the Hebrew letters, are mentioned in the works of Rabbi [[Abraham Abulafia]];<ref>Otzar Eden ha-Ganuz,</ref> some [[Rebbe|Hasidic Rabbis]] also used it, though rarely, for [[Yiddish]].<ref>E.g. the rebbes of the [[Zidichov (Hasidic dynasty)|Zhidichov dynasty]] noticed that the Yiddish word ''vaser'' (water) has the same value as ''Geshem'' (''rain'' in Hebrew), and used this fact for [[Theurgy|theurgic]] meditations</ref> However, the primary language for gematria calculations has always been and remains Hebrew and, to a lesser degree, [[Aramaic]].\n\nA classic Biblical commentary incorporating ''gematria'' is [[Baal ha-Turim]] by [[Rabbi]] [[Jacob ben Asher]].\n\n''Gematria'' is often used by the [[Maharal of Prague]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|hasidic]] [[Torah]] commentators (such as the \"''Sefath Emmeth''\" from [[G\u00f3ra Kalwaria|Gur]]).\n\n==Textual sources==\nA [[Mishna]]ic textual source makes clear that the use of gematria is dated to at least the [[Tannaic]] period.\n\n[[Pirkei Avot]] 3:23 (= m. Avot 3:19 per Danby):\n\n{{lang|he|\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05e2\u05d6\u05e8 \u05d1\u05df \u05d7\u05e1\u05de\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05e8, \u05e7\u05e0\u05d9\u05df \u05d5\u05e4\u05ea\u05d7\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d4\u05df \u05d4\u05df \u05d2\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9 \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d5\u05ea. \u05ea\u05e7\u05d5\u05e4\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05d2\u05de\u05d8\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05e4\u05e8\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d4.}}\n\n<blockquote>\nRabbi [[Eleazar Chisma]]<ref>astronomer and mathematician and knew geometry, Horayoth 10 a-b</ref> said: the laws of mixed bird offerings and the key to the calculations of [[menstruation]] days\u2014these, these are the body of the halakhah.

In other words, these sciences, while important, are yet only auxiliary and secondary. What is primary is the Torah. What is central is the life-giving law.<ref>Bunim, I (1964). \"Ethics From Sinai\", Feldheim</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn Danby's translation of the Mishnah <ref>''The Mishnah'', trans. by Herbert Danby, Oxford University Press, 1933.</ref>, he writes a footnote concerning 'gematria' in m. Avot 3.19, \"Astronomy and geometry are meant. Of these Eleazar Chisma is reported to have been a diligent student. 'Gematria' later came to mean the device of finding esoteric meanings in words by means of the numerical values of their constituent letters.\" However, Danby also notes a case of the latter kind of gematria already in m.

More advanced methods are usually used for the most significant Biblical verses, [[Jewish liturgy|prayers]], names of God and angels etc.\n* ''Mispar Hechrachi'' (absolute value) that uses full numerical value of the 22 letters. Sometimes it is also called ''Mispar ha-Panim'' (face number), as opposed to the more complicated ''Mispar ha-Akhor'' (back number).\n* ''Mispar Gadol'' counts the final forms (sofit) of the Hebrew letters as a continuation of the numerical sequence for the alphabet, with the final letters assigned values from 500 to 900.\n* The same name, ''Mispar ha-Gadol'', is also used for another method, which spells the name of each letter and adds the standard values of the resulting string.\n* ''Mispar Katan'' calculates the value of each letter, but truncates all of the zeros. It is also sometimes called ''Mispar Me'ugal''.\n* ''Mispar Siduri'' (ordinal value) with each of the twenty-two letters given a value from one to twenty-two.\n* ''Mispar Bone'eh'' (building value, also ''Revu'a'', square<ref>Toras Menachem - Tiferes Levi Yitzchok, Vol. I - Bereshis, p. 2, fn. 7</ref>) is calculated by walking over each letter from the beginning to the end, adding the value of all previous letters and the value of the current letter to the running total. Therefore, the value of the word ''achad'' (one) is 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;8)&nbsp;+&nbsp;(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;+&nbsp;4)&nbsp;=&nbsp;23.\n* ''Mispar Kidmi'' (triangular value) uses each letter as the sum of all the standard gematria letter values preceding it. Therefore, the value of Aleph is 1, the value of Bet is 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;3, the value of Gimmel is 1+2+3=6, etc. It's also known as ''Mispar Meshulash'' (triangular or tripled number).\n* ''Mispar P'rati'' calculates the value of each letter as the square of its standard gematria value. Therefore, the value of Aleph is 1&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, the value of Bet is 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, the value of gimmel is 3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;9, etc. It's also known as ''Mispar ha-Merubah ha-Prati'''.\n* ''Mispar ha-Merubah ha-Klali'' is the square of the standard absolute value of each word.\n* ''Mispar Meshulash'' calculates the value of each letter as the cube of their standard value. The same term is more often used for ''Mispar Kidmi''.\n* ''Mispar ha-Akhor'' \u2013 The value of each letter is its standard value multiplied by the position of the letter in a word or a phrase in either ascending or descending order. This method is particularly interesting, because the result is sensitive to the order of letters. It is also sometimes called ''Mispar Meshulash'' (triangular number).\n* ''Mispar Mispari'' spells out the standard values of each letter by their Hebrew names (\"Achad\" (one) is 1+8+4=13 etc.), and then adds up the standard values of the resulting string.\n* ''Mispar Shemi'' (also Millui letter \"filling\"), uses the value of each letter as equal to the value of its name.<ref>the spelling of the name of the number comes from the Talmud</ref> For example, the value of the letter Aleph is (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;30&nbsp;+&nbsp;80)&nbsp;=&nbsp;111, Bet is (2&nbsp;+&nbsp;10&nbsp;+&nbsp;400)&nbsp;=&nbsp;412, etc. Sometimes the same operation is applied two or more times recursively.\n* ''Mispar Ne'elam'' (hidden number) spells out the name of each letter without the letter itself (e.g. \"Leph\" for \"Aleph\") and adds up the value of the resulting string.\n* ''Mispar Katan Mispari'' (integral reduced value) is used where the total numerical value of a word is reduced to a single digit. If the sum of the value exceeds 9, the integer values of the total are repeatedly added to produce a single-digit number. The same value will be arrived at regardless of whether it is the absolute values, the ordinal values, or the reduced values that are being counted by methods above.\n* ''Mispar Misafi'' adds the number of the letters in the word or phrase to their gematria.\n* ''Kolel'' is the number of words, which is often added to the gematria. In case of one word, the standard value is incremented by one.\n\nWithin the wider topic of Gematria are included the various alphabet transformations where one letter is substituted by another based on a logical scheme:\n* ''[[Atbash]]'' exchanges each letter in a word or a phrase by ''opposite'' letters. Opposite letters are determined by substituting the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet (Aleph) with the last letter (Tav), the second letter (Bet) with the next to last (Shin), etc. The result can be interpreted as a secret message or calculated by the standard gematria methods. A few instances of Atbash are found already in the Hebrew [[Bible]]. For example, see [[Jeremiah]] 25:26, and 51:41, with [[Targum Jonathan|Targum]] and [[Rashi]], in which the name \u05e9\u05e9\u05da (\"Sheshek\") is thought to represent \u05d1\u05d1\u05dc ([[Babylon]]).<ref name=JE>[[Solomon Schechter]] & Caspar Levias, \"Gematria\". ''The Jewish Encyclopedia'', Volume 5. New York: Funk & Wagnalls Co. 1904. [https://archive.org/stream/jewishencyclopedia05sing#page/588/mode/2up p.589.]</ref>\n* ''Albam'' \u2013 the alphabet is divided in half, eleven letters in each section. The first letter of the first series is exchanged for the first letter of the second series, the second letter of the first series for the second letter of the second series and so forth.\n* ''Achbi'' divides the alphabet into two equal groups of eleven letters. Within each group, the first letter is replaced by the last, the second by the tenth, etc.\n* ''Ayak Bakar'' replaces each letter by another one that has a 10-times-greater value. The final letters usually signify the numbers from 500 to 900.  Thousands is reduced to ones (1000 becomes 1, 2000 becomes 2 etc.)\n* ''Ofanim'' replaces each letter by the last letter of its name (e.g. \"Fe\" for \"Aleph\").\n* ''Akhas Beta'' divides the alphabet into three groups of 7, 7 and 8 letters. Each letter is replaced cyclically by the corresponding letter of the next group. The letter [[Tav (letter)|Tav]] remains the same.\n* ''Avgad'' replaces each letter by the next one. Tav becomes Aleph. The opposite operation is also used.\nMost of the above-mentioned methods and ciphers are listed by Rabbi [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero|Moshe Cordevero]].<ref>Moshe Cordevero, ''Sefer Pardes ha-Rimonim'', ''\u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea''</ref>\n\nSome authors provide lists of as many as 231 various replacement ciphers, related to the 231 mystical Gates of the [[Sefer Yetzirah]].<ref name=\"Sefer ha-Shem\">Elazar Rokeach, Sefer ha-Shem</ref>\n\nDozens of other far more advanced methods are used in Kabbalistic literature, without any particular names. In Ms. Oxford 1,822, one article lists 75 different forms of gematria.<ref>''Encyclopedia Judaica'', 2007, vol. 7, 426</ref> Some known methods are [[recursion|recursive]] in nature and are reminiscent of the [[graph theory]] or use heavily [[combinatorics]]. Rabbi [[Eleazar of Worms|Elazar Rokeach]] often used multiplication, instead of addition, for the above-mentioned methods. For example, spelling out the letters of a word and then multiplying the squares of each letter value in the resulting string produces very large numbers, in orders of [[10^12|trillions]]. The spelling process can be applied recursively, until a certain pattern (e.g. all the letters of the word \"[[Talmud]]\") is found; the gematria of the resulting string is then calculated.  The same author also used sums of all possible unique letter combinations, which add up to the value of a given letter. For example, the letter [[He (letter)|Hei]], which has the standard value of 5, can be produced by combining 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 4&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 or 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3, which adds up to&nbsp;30. Sometimes combinations of repeating letters are not allowed (e.g. 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3 is valid, but 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is not). The original letter itself can also be viewed as a valid combination.<ref name=\"Sefer ha-Shem\" />\n\nVariant spellings of some letters can be used to produce sets of different numbers, which can be added up or analyzed separately. Many various complex [[formal systems]] and recursive algorithms, based on graph-like structural analysis of the letter names and their relations to each other, [[modular arithmetic]], pattern search and other highly advanced techniques, are found in the \"Sefer ha-Malchuth\" by Rabbi David ha-Levi of [[Draa|Draa Valley]], a Spanish-Moroccan Kabbalist of the 15\u201316th century.<ref name=\"Sefer ha-Malchut\">Sefer ha-Malchut, \"Sifrei Chaim\", Jerusalem, 2008</ref> Rabbi David ha-Levi's methods take into consideration the numerical values and other properties of the [[Niqqud|vowels]] as well.\n\nKabbalistic [[Jewish views of astrology|astrology]] uses some specific methods to determine the astrological influences on a particular person. According to one method, the gematria of the person's name is added to the gematria of his or her mother's name; the result is then divided by 7 and 12. The remainders signify a particular planet and Zodiac sign.<ref>Commentary to [[Sefer Yetzirah]], attributed to [[Saadia Gaon]], 6:4; Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Sefer Yetzirah, \"WeiserBooks\", Boston, 1997, pp. 220-221</ref>\n\n==Mathematical==\nA formula for finding a letter's corresponding number in Mispar Gadol is: <math>f(x) = \\left(10^{\\mathrm{floor}\\left(\\left(x-1\\right)\\div 9\\right)}\\right)\\times\\left(\\left(\\left(x-1\\right)\\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ 9\\right)+1\\right)</math> where ''x'' is the position of the letter in the language letters index (Regular order of letters), and the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] and [[modulo operation|modulo]] functions are used.\n\n==Absolute value==\nThe most common form of Hebrew ''gematria'' is used in the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]], and elaborately by many post-Talmudic [[rabbinic literature|commentators]]. It involves reading words and sentences as numbers, assigning numerical instead of phonetic value to each letter of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. When read as numbers, they can be compared and contrasted with other words or phrases&nbsp;\u2013 cf. the Hebrew proverb {{lang|he|\u05e0\u05db\u05e0\u05e1&nbsp;\u05d9\u05d9\u05df&nbsp;\u05d9\u05e6\u05d0&nbsp;\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3}} (''{{transl|he|nichnas&nbsp;yayin&nbsp;yatza&nbsp;sod}}'', lit. \"wine entered, secret went out\", i.e. \"''in vino veritas''\"). The gematric value of {{lang|he|\u05d9\u05d9\u05df}} (\"wine\") is 70 ({{lang|he|\u05d9}}=10; {{lang|he|\u05d9}}=10; {{lang|he|\u05df}}=50) and this is also the gematric value of {{lang|he|\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3}} (\"secret\", {{lang|he|\u05e1}}=60; {{lang|he|\u05d5}}=6; {{lang|he|\u05d3}}=4)&lrm;.<ref>Babylonian Talmud, [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|tractate Sanhedrin]] 38a, see of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2006), \"'[[false etymology|Etymythological]] [[Othering]]' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity.

Fishman]], Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 237-258.</ref>\n\n==Use in other languages==\nThe first attested use of gematria occurs in an inscription of [[Assyria]]n ruler [[Sargon II]] (727\u2013705 BC) stating that the king built the wall of [[Khorsabad]] 16,283 cubits long to correspond with the numerical value of his name.<ref>p.197, Ratzan</ref> Gematria or [[isopsephy]] was borrowed from the Greek probably soon after their adoption of the Semitic writing system. The extant examples of use in Greek come primarily from the Christian literature and, unlike rabbinic sources, is always explicitly stated as being used.<ref>p.164, Davies & Allison</ref> It has been asserted{{Where|date=January 2012}} that [[Plato]] (c. 427-347 BC) offers a discussion of gematria \"in its simplest forms\" in the [[Cratylus]], where he is said to have claimed that \"the 'essential force' of a thing's name is to be found in its numerical value, and that words and phrases of the same numerical value may be substituted in context without loss in meaning.\" A direct review of the Cratylus, however, shows that Plato made no such claim and that gematria is not discussed in it either explicitly or implicitly.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} What can be more accurately stated is that Plato's discussion in the Cratylus involves a view of words and names as referring (more or less accurately) to the \"essential nature\" of a person or object, and that this view may have influenced&nbsp;\u2013 and is central to&nbsp;\u2013 ''Greek gematria''.<ref>Marc Hirshman, ''Theology and exegesis in midrashic literature'', in Jon Whitman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7EjIm3pAfhQC&pg=PA113 Interpretation and allegory: antiquity to the modern period].

Many researchers connect the \"[[Number of the Beast]]\", referred to in the [[Book of Revelation]] of the [[New Testament]], with Hebrew gematria as used by the early Christians. According to such interpretations, the number in question, ''six hundred sixty-six'' (666) - ''Revelation 13:18'' - was originally derived via the Greek name of the Roman emperor at the time - Neron Kaisar - transliterated into Hebrew gematria. The Latin name [[Nero Caesar]] transliterated into Hebrew gematria equals six hundred sixteen (616).

[[Bob Weir]], the youngest original member of the group, played [[rhythm guitar]]. [[Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan]] played [[Hammond organ|keyboards]] and [[harmonica]] until shortly before his death in 1973 at the age of 27. Garcia, Weir, and McKernan shared the lead vocal duties more or less equally; Lesh only sang a few leads, but his tenor was a key part of the band's three-part vocal harmonies. [[Bill Kreutzmann]] played [[drum]]s, and in September 1967 was joined by a second drummer, New York native [[Mickey Hart]], who also played a wide variety of other [[percussion instrument]]s.\n\n1970 included tour dates in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], where the band performed at [[The Warehouse (New Orleans)|The Warehouse]] for two nights. On January 31, 1970, the local police raided their hotel on [[Bourbon Street]], and arrested and charged a total of 19 people with possession of various drugs.<ref>\"Drug Raid Nets 19 in French Quarter\", ''The Times-Picayune'', February 1, 1970</ref> The second night's concert was performed as scheduled after bail was posted. Eventually, the charges were dismissed, except those against sound engineer [[Owsley Stanley]], who was already facing charges in California for manufacturing LSD. This event was later memorialized in the lyrics of the song \"[[Truckin']]\", a single from ''American Beauty'' which reached number 64 on the charts.\n\nMickey Hart took time off from the Grateful Dead beginning in February 1971,<ref>{{cite web|last=Planer|first=Lindsay|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rolling-thunder-r102792/review|title=''Rolling Thunder:'' Review|work=AllMusic|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref> leaving Kreutzmann once again as the sole percussionist. Hart rejoined the Grateful Dead for good in October 1974. [[Tom Constanten|Tom \"TC\" Constanten]] was added as a second keyboardist from 1968 to 1970, while Pigpen also played various percussion instruments and sang.\n\nAfter Constanten's departure, Pigpen reclaimed his position as sole keyboardist. Less than two years later, in late 1971, Pigpen was joined by another keyboardist, [[Keith Godchaux (musician)|Keith Godchaux]], who played [[grand piano]] alongside Pigpen's [[Hammond organ|Hammond B-3 organ]].

His final concert appearance was June 17, 1972, at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], in [[Los Angeles]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Pigpen Played His Final Show with the Grateful Dead Today in 1972|url=https://www.relix.com/blogs/detail/pigpen_played_his_final_show_with_the_grateful_dead_today_in_1972|website=Relix|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>Scott, Dolgushkin, Nixon, \"Deadbase X\", New Hampshire, p.23. {{ISBN|1-877657-21-2}}</ref> he died in March 1973 of complications from liver damage.<ref>McNally, Dennis, \"A Long Strange Trip\", New York 2002, p.584. {{ISBN|0-7679-1186-5}}</ref>\n\nThe death of Pigpen did not slow the band down, and they continued with their new members.

Not long after that album\u2019s release however, the Dead decided to take a hiatus from live [[Concert tour|touring]].\n\nIn September 1975, the Dead released their eighth studio album, ''[[Blues for Allah]]''. Their hiatus was short-lived, though, as they resumed touring in June 1976.<ref name=\"vh1.com\"/> That same year, they signed with Arista Records. Their new contract soon produced ''[[Terrapin Station]]'' in 1977. The band's tour in the spring of that year is held in high regard by their fans, and their [[Cornell 5/8/77|concert of May 8]] at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]] is often considered to be one of the best performances of their career.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spevak|first1=Jeff|title=Was \u201977 Grateful Dead show the best ever?|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/2017/04/06/greatest-grateful-dead-show-ever/100067332/|website=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle|accessdate=June 23, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Catalano|first1=Jim|title=40 years later, Grateful Dead's Barton Hall concert shines bright for the fans|url=http://www.ithacajournal.com/story/entertainment/2017/04/27/grateful-dead-ithaca/100843658/|website=Ithaca Journal|accessdate=June 23, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Cush|first1=Andy|title=Today Is \"Grateful Dead Day\", the 40th Anniversary of the Band\u2019s Legendary Cornell Show|url=http://www.spin.com/2017/05/grateful-dead-day-cornell-show-40th-anniversary/|website=Spin|accessdate=June 23, 2017|date=May 8, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617070703/http://www.spin.com/2017/05/grateful-dead-day-cornell-show-40th-anniversary/|archivedate=June 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough things appeared to be going well for the band, problems were arising with their two newest members, Keith and Donna Jean Godchaux. The pair were frequently fighting, and Keith's heroin addiction was affecting his playing. Both of these issues were causing complications with touring, and they agreed to leave the band in February 1979.\n\n[[File:Jerry-Mickey at Red Rocks taken 08-11-87.jpg|left|thumb|Grateful Dead performing at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] in 1987: Jerry Garcia ([[Doug Irwin|custom Tiger guitar]]), Mickey Hart (drums).]]Following the departure of the Godchauxs, [[Brent Mydland]] joined as keyboardist and vocalist and was considered \"the perfect fit\". The Godchauxs then formed the [[Heart of Gold Band]] before Keith died in a car accident in 1980. Mydland was the keyboardist for the Grateful Dead for 11 years until his death by narcotics overdose in July 1990,<ref>{{cite web|title=Grateful Dead Member Died Of Overdose, Coroner Rules|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDA153DF931A2575BC0A966958260|date=August 12, 1990|publisher=New York Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212234212/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDA153DF931A2575BC0A966958260|archivedate=February 12, 2009}}</ref> becoming the third keyboardist to die.\n\nDuring the 1980s the band transformed as the talents of Mydland helped power the group. Shortly after Mydland found his place in the early 1980s, Garcia's health began to decline. His drug habits caused him to lose his liveliness on stage. After beginning to curtail his opiate usage in 1985 gradually, Garcia slipped into a [[diabetic coma]] for several days in July 1986. After he recovered, the band released ''[[In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)|In the Dark]]'' in July 1987, which became their best selling studio album and produced their only top-10 single, \"[[Touch of Grey]]\". Also that year, the group [[Bob Dylan and Grateful Dead Tour 1987|toured]] with [[Bob Dylan]], as heard on the album ''[[Dylan & the Dead]]''.\n\nInspired by Garcia's improved health and a successful album, the band's energy and chemistry peaked in the late 1980s and 1990. Performances were vigorous, and as a result, every show exceeded its maximum audience capacity. The band's \"high time\" came to a sudden halt when Mydland died after the summer tour in 1990. They now had to rebuild; [[Vince Welnick]], former keyboardist for [[the Tubes]], joined as a band member, while [[Bruce Hornsby]], who had a successful career with his band the Range, joined as a touring member. Both performed on keyboards and vocals \u2013 Welnick until the band's end, and Hornsby mainly from 1990 to 1992.\n\n==Aftermath (1995 to present)==\n[[File:Weir, Bob (2007) 2.jpg|thumb|235px|[[Bob Weir]] onstage in 2007, playing a [[Modulus Guitars|Modulus]] G3FH]]\n[[File:Mickey Hart leading a drum circle.jpg|thumb|256px|[[Mickey Hart]] leading a [[drum circle]] in February 2005]]\n{{See also|Reunions of the Grateful Dead}}\n\n[[Jerry Garcia]] died in August 1995 and the remaining band members decided to disband.<ref>Selvin, Joel (December 9, 1995).

Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring [[New York City]] band [[the Lovin' Spoonful]] that they decided to \"go electric\" and look for a dirtier sound. [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Bob Weir]] (each of whom had been immersed in the [[American folk music revival]] of the late 1950s and early 1960s), were open-minded to electric guitars.\n\nThe Grateful Dead's early music (in the mid-1960s) was part of the process of establishing what \"[[psychedelic music]]\" was, but theirs was essentially a \"street party\" form of it. They developed their \"psychedelic\" playing as a result of meeting [[Ken Kesey]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], and subsequently becoming the house band for the [[Acid Tests]] he staged.<ref>[[Tom Wolfe|Wolfe, Tom]] (1968). ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'', Farrar Straus & Giroux</ref> They did not fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, melded several of them. [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] said of the Grateful Dead, \"They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones that do what they do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/03.97/rock-art-97-3.html|title=Bjerklie, Steve. \"What are They Worth?\", MetroActive|publisher=Metroactive.com|accessdate=July 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515181358/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/03.97/rock-art-97-3.html|archivedate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.\n\nTheir live shows, fed by an improvisational approach to music, were different from most touring bands. While rock and roll bands often rehearse a standard set, played with minor variations, the Grateful Dead did not prepare in this way. Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, \"We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work off the tops of our heads than off a piece of paper.\"<ref name=\"The Grateful Dead p. 17\">The Grateful Dead: Playing in the Band, David Gans and Peter Simon, St Martin Press, 1985 p. 17</ref> They maintained this approach throughout their career. For each performance, the band drew material from an active list of a hundred or so songs.<ref name=\"The Grateful Dead p. 17\"/>\n\nThe 1969 live album ''[[Live/Dead]]'' did capture the band in-form, but commercial success did not come until ''[[Workingman's Dead]]'' and ''[[American Beauty (album)|American Beauty]]'', both released in 1970. These records largely featured the band's laid-back [[acoustic music]]ianship and more traditional song structures.

Lesh, who was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms, but more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often sounding like a second lead guitar. Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at the upper end of the Dead's sound. The two drummers, [[Mickey Hart]] and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its style.<ref>Cavallo, Dominick.

We're more into ''transportation'' than we are into music, per se, I mean, the business of the Grateful Dead is transportation.\"<ref name=\"Henry 1991\"/>\n\nTheir numerous studio albums were generally collections of new songs that they had first played in concert. The band was also famous for its extended musical jams, which featured both individual improvisations as well as distinctive \"group-mind\" improvisations during which each of the band members improvised individually while simultaneously blending together as a cohesive musical unit. Musically, this may be illustrated in that the band not only improvised within the form of songs, but also with the form. The Grateful Dead have often been described as having never played the same song the same way twice. The cohesive listening abilities of each band member made for a transcendence of what might be called \"free form\" and improvisation. Their concert sets often blended songs, one into the next (a [[segue]]).\n\n===Concert sound systems===\nThe [[Wall of Sound (Grateful Dead)|Wall of Sound]] was a large sound system designed specifically for the Grateful Dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pechner.smugmug.com/gallery/2383161|title=Pechner Productions- powered by SmugMug|publisher=Pechner.smugmug.com|accessdate=July 16, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125144654/http://www.pechner.smugmug.com/gallery/2383161|archivedate=November 25, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alembic.com/family/history.html|title=Alembic History&nbsp;\u2013 Long Version|publisher=Alembic.com|date=August 22, 2001|accessdate=July 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712132709/http://alembic.com/family/history.html|archivedate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> The band was never satisfied with the house system anywhere they played. After the Monterey Pop Festival, the band's crew 'borrowed' some of the other performers' sound equipment and used it to host some free shows in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lostlivedead.blogspot.com/2010/01/may-june-1967-grateful-dead-itinerary.html|title=May\u2013June 1967 Grateful Dead Itinerary Overview|publisher=lostlivedead.blogspot.com|date=January 1, 2010|accessdate=October 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919184758/http://lostlivedead.blogspot.com/2010/01/may-june-1967-grateful-dead-itinerary.html|archivedate=September 19, 2011}}</ref> In their early days, soundman [[Owsley Stanley|Owsley \"Bear\" Stanley]] designed a [[public address]] (PA) and monitor system for them. Stanley was the Grateful Dead's [[Audio engineering|soundman]] for many years; he was also one of the largest suppliers of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].<ref>McNally, Dennis, \"A Long Strange Trip\", New York 2002, pp.118\u201319. {{ISBN|0-7679-1185-7}} and Brightman, Carol, \"Sweet Chaos\", New York 1998, p. 100-104. {{ISBN|0-671-01117-0}}</ref> Stanley's sound systems were delicate and finicky, and frequently brought shows to a halt with technical breakdowns. After Stanley went to jail for manufacturing LSD in 1970, the group briefly used house PAs, but found them to be even less reliable than those built by their former soundman. On February 2, 1970 the group contacted [[Bob Heil]] to use his system.<ref name=\"performing\">{{cite news|url=http://www.performing-musician.com/pm/dec08/articles/bobheil.htm?print=yes#top|title=The Night that Modern Live Sound Was Born: Bob Heil and the Grateful Dead|last=Daley|first=Dan|date=December 2008|publisher=''Performing Musician''|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}</ref> In 1971, the band purchased their first [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] sound system from [[Alembic Inc]] Studios. Because of this, Alembic would play an integral role in the research, development, and production of the Wall of Sound. The band also welcomed [[Dan Healy (soundman)|Dan Healy]] into the fold on a permanent basis that year. Healy would mix the Grateful Dead's live sound until 1993.\n\n===Tapes===\nLike several other bands during this time, the Grateful Dead allowed their fans to record their shows. For many years the [[Taper (concert)|tapers]] set up their microphones wherever they could, and the eventual forest of microphones became a problem for the official sound crew. Eventually, this was solved by having a dedicated taping section located behind the [[Sound board (music)|sound board]], which required a special \"tapers\" ticket. The band allowed sharing of tapes of their shows, as long as no profits were made on the sale of their show tapes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/GratefulDead|title=Internet Archive: Grateful Dead|publisher=Archive.org|accessdate=July 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719012925/http://www.archive.org/details/GratefulDead|archivedate=July 19, 2011}}</ref> Sometimes the sound crew would allow the tapers to connect directly to the sound board, which created exceptional concert recordings.<ref name=\"Archive.org\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=47634|title=Internet Archive Forums: Grateful Dead concert recordings on the Internet Archive|publisher=Archive.org|accessdate=February 25, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001075250/http://www.archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=47634|archivedate=October 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nRecently, there have been some disputes over which recordings [[Internet Archive|archive.org]] could host on their site.

Sullivan's drawing was an illustration for a 1913 edition of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]''. Earlier antecedents include the custom of exhibiting the relic skulls of Christian martyrs decorated with roses on their feast days. The rose is an attribute of [[Saint Valentine]], who according to one legend, was martyred by decapitation. Accordingly, in Rome, at the church dedicated to him, the observance of his feast day included the display of his skull surrounded by roses.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rome: A Holiday Magazine Travel Guide|publisher=Random House|location=New York|date=1960}}</ref> Kelley and Mouse's design originally appeared on a poster for the September 16 and 17, 1966 Dead shows at the [[Avalon Ballroom]].<ref>{{cite news|author=du Lac, J.

Conversely, if one of <math>(a * b) * c</math> and <math>a * (b * c)</math> are defined, then so are both <math>a*b</math> and <math>b*c</math> (and again <math>(a * b) * c</math> = <math>a * (b * c)</math>).\n# ''[[Multiplicative inverse|Inverse]]'': <math>a^{-1} * a</math> and <math>a*{a^{-1}}</math> are always defined.\n# ''[[Identity (mathematics)|Identity]]'': If <math>a*b</math> is defined, then <math>a*b*{b^{-1}} = a</math>, and <math>{a^{-1}} * a * b = b</math>.

We write ''f'' : ''x'' \u2192 ''y'' to indicate that ''f'' is an element of ''G''(''x'',''y'').\n* For every object ''x'', a designated element <math>\\mathrm{id}_x</math> of ''G''(''x'',''x'');\n* For each triple of objects ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', a [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>\\mathrm{comp}_{x,y,z} : G(y, z)\\times G(x, y) \\rightarrow G(x, z): (g, f) \\mapsto gf</math>;\n* For each pair of objects ''x'', ''y'' a function <math>\\mathrm{inv}: G(x, y) \\rightarrow G(y, x): f \\mapsto f^{-1}</math>;\n\nsatisfying, for any ''f'' : ''x'' \u2192 ''y'', ''g'' : ''y'' \u2192 ''z'', and ''h'' : ''z'' \u2192 ''w'':\n* <math>f \\mathrm{id}_x = f</math> and <math>\\mathrm{id}_y f = f</math>;\n* <math>(hg)f = h(gf)</math>;\n* <math>f f^{-1} = \\mathrm{id}_y</math> and <math>f^{-1} f = \\mathrm{id}_x</math>.\n\nIf ''f'' is an element of ''G''(''x'',''y'') then ''x'' is called the '''source''' of ''f'', written ''s''(''f''), and ''y'' the '''target''' of ''f'' (written ''t''(''f'')).\n\nMore generally, one can consider a [[groupoid object]] in an arbitrary category admitting finite fiber products.\n\n===Comparing the definitions===\nThe algebraic and category-theoretic definitions are equivalent, as follows. Given a groupoid in the category-theoretic sense, let ''G'' be the [[disjoint union]] of all of the sets ''G''(''x'',''y'') (i.e. the sets of morphisms from ''x'' to ''y'').\n\nThen <math>\\mathrm{comp}</math> and <math>\\mathrm{inv}</math> become partially defined operations on ''G'', and <math>\\mathrm{inv}</math> will in fact be defined everywhere; so we define \u2217 <!--this is Unicode character U+2217, and should look similar to <math>*</math>--> to be <math>\\mathrm{comp}</math> and <sup>\u22121</sup> to be <math>\\mathrm{inv}</math>. Thus we have a groupoid in the algebraic sense. Explicit reference to ''G''<sub>0</sub> (and hence to <math>\\mathrm{id}</math>) can be dropped.\n\nConversely, given a groupoid ''G'' in the algebraic sense, and define an equivalence relation <math>\\sim</math> between its elements as\n<math>a\\sim b</math> if  ''a'' \u2217 ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> =  ''b'' \u2217 ''b''<sup>\u22121</sup>. \n\nLet ''G''<sub>0</sub> be the set of equivalence classes of <math>\\sim</math>, that is, <math>G_0:=G/\\sim</math>. Denote  ''a'' \u2217 ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> with <math>1_x</math> if <math>a\\in x</math> with <math>x\\in G_0</math>.\n\nDefine\n\n<math>G(x, y)</math>\n\nas the set of all elements ''f'' such that\n\n:<math>1_x*f*1_y</math>\n\nexists. Given\n\n:<math>f \\in G(x,y) \\quad\\mathrm{and}\\quad \ng \\in G(y, z)</math>,\n\ntheir composite is defined as\n\n:<math>gf:=f*g \\in G(x,z)</math>.\n\nTo see this is well defined, observe that since\n\n: <math>(1_x*f)*1_y</math> and <math>1_y*(g*1_z)</math>\n\nexist, so does\n\n:<math>(1_x*f*1_y)*(g*1_z)=f*g</math>.\n\nThe identity morphism on ''x'' is then <math>1_x</math>, and the category-theoretic inverse of ''f'' is ''f''<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\n''Sets'' in the definitions above may be replaced with [[class (set theory)|class]]es, as is generally the case in [[category theory]].\n\n===Vertex groups===\nGiven a groupoid ''G'', the '''vertex groups''' or '''isotropy groups''' or '''object groups''' in ''G'' are the subsets of the form ''G''(''x'',''x''), where ''x'' is any object of ''G''.  It follows easily from the axioms above that these are indeed groups, as every pair of elements is composable and inverses are in the same vertex group.\n\n===Category of groupoids===\nA '''subgroupoid''' is a [[subcategory]] that is itself a groupoid. A '''groupoid morphism''' is simply a functor between two (category-theoretic) groupoids. The category whose objects are groupoids and whose morphisms are groupoid morphisms is called the '''groupoid category''', or the '''category of groupoids''', denoted '''Grpd'''.\n\nIt is useful that this category is, like the category of small categories,  [[Cartesian closed]]. That is, we can construct  for any groupoids <math>H,K</math> a groupoid  C<math>\\operatorname{GPD}(H,K)</math> whose objects are the morphisms <math> H \\to K </math> and whose arrows are the natural equivalences  of morphisms. Thus if <math> H,K </math> are just groups, then such arrows are the conjugacies of morphisms. The main result is that for any groupoids <math> G,H,K </math> there is a natural bijection\n\n<math>\\operatorname{Grpd}(G \\times H, K) \\cong \\operatorname{Grpd}(G, \\operatorname{GPD}(H,K)).</math>\n\nThis result is of interest even if all the groupoids <math> G,H,K </math> are just groups.\n\n===Fibrations and coverings===\nParticular kinds of morphisms of groupoids are of interest. A morphism <math>p: E \\to B</math> of groupoids is called a [[fibration]] if for each object <math>x</math> of <math>E</math> and each morphism <math>b</math> of <math>B</math> starting at <math>p(x)</math> there is a morphism <math>e</math> of <math>E</math> starting at <math>x</math>  such that <math>p(e)=b</math>. A fibration is called a [[covering morphism]] or [[covering of groupoids]] if further such an <math>e</math> is unique. The covering morphisms of groupoids are especially useful because they can be used to model [[covering map]]s of spaces.<ref>J.P. May, ''A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology'', 1999, The University of Chicago Press {{ISBN|0-226-51183-9}} (''see chapter 2'')</ref>\n\nIt is also true that the category of covering morphisms of a given groupoid <math>B</math> is equivalent to the category of actions of the groupoid <math>B</math> on sets.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n===Linear algebra===\nGiven a [[field (algebra)|field]] ''K'', the corresponding '''general linear groupoid''' ''GL''<sub>*</sub>(''K'') consists of all [[matrix inversion|invertible]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], of any size, whose entries range over ''K''. [[Matrix multiplication]] interprets composition. If ''G'' = ''GL''<sub>*</sub>(''K''), then the set of [[natural number]]s is a [[proper subset]] of ''G''<sub>0</sub>, since for each [[natural number]] ''n'', there is a corresponding [[identity matrix]] of dimension ''n''.  ''G''(''m'',''n'') is [[empty set|empty]] unless ''m''=''n'', in which case it is the set of all ''n''x''n'' invertible matrices.\n\n===Topology===\n{{Main|Fundamental groupoid}}\nGiven a [[topological space]] <math>X</math>, let <math>G_0</math> be the set <math>X</math>. The morphisms from the point <math>p</math> to the point <math>q</math> are [[equivalence class]]es of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[path (topology)|path]]s from <math>p</math> to <math>q</math>, with two paths being equivalent if they are [[homotopic]].\nTwo such morphisms are composed by first following the first path, then the second; the homotopy equivalence guarantees that this composition is [[associative]]. This groupoid is called the [[fundamental groupoid]] of <math>X</math>, denoted <math>\\pi_1(X)</math> (or sometimes, <math>\\Pi_1(X)</math>).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/fundamental+groupoid|title=fundamental groupoid in nLab|website=ncatlab.org|access-date=2017-09-17}}</ref>  The usual fundamental group <math>\\pi_1(X,x)</math> is then the vertex group for the point <math>x</math>.\n\nAn important extension of this idea is to consider the fundamental groupoid <math>\\pi_1(X,A)</math> where <math>A\\subset X</math> is a chosen set of \"base points\". Here, one considers only paths whose endpoints belong to <math>A</math>. <math>\\pi_1(X,A)</math> is a sub-groupoid of <math>\\pi_1(X)</math>. The set <math>A</math> may be chosen according to the geometry of the situation at hand.\n\n===Equivalence relation===\nIf <math>X</math> is a set with an [[equivalence relation]] denoted by [[infix]] <math>\\sim</math>, then a groupoid \"representing\" this equivalence relation can be formed as follows:\n* The objects of the groupoid are the elements of <math>X</math>;\n*For any two elements <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in <math>X</math>, there is a single morphism from <math>x</math> to <math>y</math> [[if and only if]] <math>x\\sim y</math>.\n\n===Group action===\nIf the [[group (mathematics)|group]] <math>G</math> acts on the set <math>X</math>, then we can form the '''action groupoid''' (or '''transformation groupoid''') representing this [[group action]] as follows:\n*The objects are the elements of <math>X</math>;\n*For any two elements <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in <math>X</math>, the [[morphism]]s from <math>x</math> to <math>y</math> correspond to the elements <math>g</math> of <math>G</math> such that <math>gx = y</math>;\n*[[Function composition|Composition]] of morphisms interprets the [[binary operation]] of <math>G</math>.\n\nMore explicitly, the ''action groupoid'' is a small category with  <math>\\mathrm{ob}(C)=X</math> and <math>\\mathrm{hom}(C)=G\\times X</math> with source and target maps <math>s(g,x) = x</math> and <math>t(g,x) = gx</math>.  It is often denoted <math>G \\ltimes X</math> (or <math>X\\rtimes G</math>). Multiplication (or composition) in the groupoid is then <math>(h,y)(g,x) = (hg,x)</math> which is defined provided <math>y=gx</math>.\n\nFor <math>x</math> in <math>X</math>, the vertex group consists of those <math>(g,x)</math> with <math>gx=x</math>, which is just the isotropy subgroup at <math>x</math> for the given action (which is why vertex groups are also called isotropy groups).\n\nAnother way to describe <math>G</math>-sets is the [[functor category]] <math>[\\mathrm{Gr},\\mathrm{Set}]</math>, where <math>\\mathrm{Gr}</math> is the groupoid (category) with one element and [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the group <math>G</math>. Indeed, every functor <math>F</math> of this category defines a set <math>X=F(\\mathrm{Gr})</math> and for every <math>g</math> in <math>G</math> (i.e. for every morphism in <math>\\mathrm{Gr}</math>) induces a [[bijection]] <math>F_g</math> : <math>X\\to X</math>. The categorical structure of the functor <math>F</math> assures us that <math>F</math> defines a <math>G</math>-action on the set <math>G</math>. The (unique) [[representable functor]] <math>F</math> : <math>\\mathrm{Gr}</math>\u2192<math>\\mathrm{Set}</math> is the [[Cayley's theorem|Cayley representation]] of <math>G</math>. In fact, this functor is isomorphic to <math>\\mathrm{Hom}(\\mathrm{Gr},-)</math> and so sends <math>\\mathrm{ob}(\\mathrm{Gr})</math> to the set <math>\\mathrm{Hom}(\\mathrm{Gr},\\mathrm{Gr})</math> which is by definition the \"set\" <math>G</math> and the morphism <math>g</math> of <math>\\mathrm{Gr}</math> (i.e. the element <math>g</math> of <math>G</math>) to the permutation <math>F_g</math> of the set <math>G</math>. We deduce from the [[Yoneda embedding]] that the group <math>G</math> is isomorphic to the group <math>{F_g\\mid g\\in G}</math>, a [[subgroup]] of the group of [[permutation group|permutation]]s of <math>G</math>.\n\n===Fifteen puzzle===\n\nThe transformations of the [[fifteen puzzle]] form a groupoid (not a group, as not all moves can be composed).<ref>Jim Belk (2008) [https://cornellmath.wordpress.com/2008/01/27/puzzles-groups-and-groupoids/ Puzzles, Groups, and Groupoids], The Everything Seminar</ref><ref>[http://www.neverendingbooks.org/the-15-puzzle-groupoid-1 The 15-puzzle groupoid (1)], Never Ending Books</ref><ref>[http://www.neverendingbooks.org/the-15-puzzle-groupoid-2 The 15-puzzle groupoid (2)], Never Ending Books</ref> This [[Group action#Generalizations|groupoid acts]] on configurations.\n\n===Mathieu groupoid===\n\nThe [[Mathieu groupoid]] is a groupoid introduced by [[John Horton Conway]] acting on 13 points such that the elements fixing a point form a copy of the [[Mathieu group]] M<sub>12</sub>.\n\n== Relation to groups ==\n{{Group-like structures}}\nIf a groupoid has only one object, then the set of its morphisms forms a [[group (algebra)|group]]. Using the algebraic definition, such a groupoid is literally just a group.<ref>Mapping a group to the corresponding groupoid with one object is sometimes called delooping, especially in the context of [[Homotopy|homotopy theory]], see {{Cite web|url=https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/delooping#delooping_of_a_group_to_a_groupoid|title=delooping in nLab|website=ncatlab.org|access-date=2017-10-31}}.</ref> Many concepts of [[group theory]] generalize to groupoids, with the notion of [[functor]] replacing that of [[group homomorphism]].\n\nIf <math>x</math> is an object of the groupoid <math>G</math>, then the set of all morphisms from <math>x</math> to <math>x</math> forms a group <math>G(x)</math> (called the vertex group, defined above). If there is a morphism <math>f</math> from <math>x</math> to <math>y</math>, then the groups <math>G(x)</math> and <math>G(y)</math> are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]], with an isomorphism given by the [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] <math>g\\to fgf^{-1}</math>.\n\nEvery [[connected (category theory)|connected]] groupoid (that is, one in which any two objects are connected by at least one morphism) is isomorphic to an action groupoid (as defined above) (<math>G</math>, <math>X</math>) [by connectedness, there will only be one [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] under the action]. If the groupoid is not connected, then it is isomorphic to a [[disjoint union]] of groupoids of the above type (possibly with different groups <math>G</math> and sets <math>X</math> for each connected component).\n\nNote that the isomorphism described above is not unique, and there is no [[natural equivalence|natural]] choice. Choosing such an isomorphism for a connected groupoid essentially amounts to picking one object <math>x_0</math>, a [[group isomorphism]] <math>h</math> from <math>G(x_0)</math> to <math>G</math>, and for each <math>x</math> other than <math>x_0</math>, a morphism in <math>G</math> from <math>x_0</math> to <math>x</math>.\n\nIn category-theoretic terms, each connected component of a groupoid is [[equivalent categories|equivalent]] (but not [[isomorphic categories|isomorphic]]) to a groupoid with a single object, that is, a single group. Thus any groupoid is equivalent to a [[multiset]] of unrelated groups. In other words, for equivalence instead of isomorphism, one need not specify the sets <math>X</math>, only the groups <math>G</math>.\n\nConsider the examples in the previous section. The general linear groupoid is both equivalent and isomorphic to the disjoint union of the various [[general linear group]]s <math>GL_n(F)</math>. On the other hand:\n*The fundamental groupoid of <math>X</math> is equivalent to the collection of the [[fundamental group]]s of each [[path-connected component]] of <math>X</math>, but an isomorphism requires specifying the set of points in each component;\n*The set <math>X</math> with the equivalence relation <math>\\sim</math> is equivalent (as a groupoid) to one copy of the [[trivial group]] for each [[equivalence class]], but an isomorphism requires specifying what each equivalence class is:\n*The set <math>X</math> equipped with an [[group action|action]] of the group <math>G</math> is equivalent (as a groupoid) to one copy of <math>G</math> for each [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] of the action, but an [[isomorphism]] requires specifying what set each orbit is.\n\nThe collapse of a groupoid into a mere collection of groups loses some information, even from a category-theoretic point of view, because it is not [[natural (category theory)|natural]]. Thus when groupoids arise in terms of other structures, as in the above examples, it can be helpful to maintain the full groupoid. Otherwise, one must choose a way to view each <math>G(x)</math> in terms of a single group, and this choice can be arbitrary. In our example from [[topology]], you would have to make a coherent choice of paths (or equivalence classes of paths) from each point <math>p</math> to each point <math>q</math> in the same path-connected component.\n\nAs a more illuminating example, the classification of groupoids with one [[endomorphism]] does not reduce to purely group theoretic considerations. This is analogous to the fact that the classification of [[vector space]]s with one endomorphism is nontrivial.\n\nMorphisms of groupoids come in more kinds than those of groups: we have, for example,  [[fibration]]s, [[covering morphism]]s, [[universal morphism]]s, and [[quotient morphism]]s. Thus a subgroup ''H'' of a group <math>G</math> yields an action of <math>G</math> on the set of [[coset]]s of <math>H</math> in <math>G</math> and hence a covering morphism <math>p</math> from, say, <math>K</math> to <math>G</math>, where <math>K</math> is a groupoid with [[#Vertex groups|vertex group]]s isomorphic to <math>H</math>. In this way, presentations of the group <math>G</math> can be \"lifted\" to presentations of the groupoid <math>K</math>, and this is a useful way of obtaining information about presentations of the subgroup <math>H</math>.

It is mentioned in dance manuals from England, France, Spain, Germany, and Italy.\n\n==Dance form==\nThe galliard is not an improvised dance; but rather, it consists of choreographed patterns of steps, which occupy one or more measures of music. In 1 measure, a galliard typically has five steps; in French such a basic step is called a ''cinq pas'' and in Italy, ''cinque passi''. This is sometimes written in English sources as ''sinkapace''. These steps are: right, left, right, left, cadence.\n\n[[File:Galliard dance pattern.png|thumb|left|250px|Galliard rhythm<ref>Blatter, Alfred (2007). ''Revisiting Music Theory: A Guide to the Practice'', p. 28. {{ISBN|0-415-97440-2}}.</ref>]]\n\nThe galliard is an athletic dance, characterised by leaps, jumps, hops and other similar figures. The main feature that defines a galliard step is the last two beats consist of a large jump, landing with one leg ahead of the other. This jump is called a ''cadence,'' and the final landing is called the ''posture.'' The sources generally describe movement patterns starting on the left foot, then repeating it starting with the right foot.\n<!-- So is the hypermeter in 5 or 6 (with the cadence lasting twice as long as the other of the five steps. Somebody write that in if they know. -->\nA galliard pattern may also last twice as long, or more, which would involve 11 steps, or 17 steps.\n\nThe galliard was a favourite dance of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], and although it is a relatively vigorous dance, in 1589 when the Queen was aged in her mid fifties, John Stanhope of the Privy Chamber reported, \"the Queen is so well as I assure you, six or seven galliards in a morning, besides music and singing, is her ordinary exercise.\"<ref name=\"Brissenden\">{{cite book | last=Brissenden | first=Alan | year=1981 | title=Shakespeare and the Dance | publisher=Humanities Press | location=[[Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey|Atlantic Highlands, N.J.]] | isbn=0-391-01810-8 | pages=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\nWhile most commonly being an entire dance, the galliard's steps are used within many other forms of dance. For example, 16th-century Italian dances in [[Fabritio Caroso]]'s (1581) and [[Cesare Negri]]'s (1602) dance manuals often have a galliard section.\n\nOne special step used during a galliard is [[lavolta]], a step which involves an intimate, close hold between a couple, with the woman being lifted into the air and the couple turning 270 degrees, within one six-beat measure. Lavolta was considered by some dancing masters as an inappropriate dance.\n\nAnother special step used during a galliard is the tassel kick (Salti del Fiocco). These steps are found in Negri's manual and involve a galliard step usually (though not always) ending with a spin.  The easier steps involve single spins of 180 or 360 degrees; later, more difficult steps involve multiple sequential spins and spins of up to at least 540 degrees.  During the spin, the dancer kicks out to touch a [[tassel]] suspended between knee and waist height.\n\n==Musical form==\nMusical compositions in the galliard form appear to have been written and performed after the dance fell out of popular use. In musical compositions, the galliard often filled the role of an ''after dance'' written in 6, which followed and mimicked another piece (sometimes a [[pavane]]) written in 4. The distinctive 6 beats to the phrase can still be heard today in songs such as \"[[God Save the Queen]]\".\n\n==See also==\n*[[Saltarello]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Sources==\n*Caroso, Fabritio. 1581.

They also deal with diseases involving the [[human skin|skin]], [[breast]], [[soft tissue]], [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[peripheral]] [[vascular surgery]] and [[hernia]]s and perform endoscopic procedures such as [[gastroscopy]] and [[colonoscopy]].\n\n==Scope==\n\nGeneral surgeons may sub-specialize into one or more of the following disciplines:\n\n===Trauma surgery/ Surgical Critical Care===\n{{Main|Trauma surgery}}\nIn many parts of the world including [[North America]], [[Australia]] and the [[UK|United Kingdom]], the overall responsibility for [[major trauma|trauma care]] falls under the auspices of general surgery. Some general surgeons obtain advanced training in this field (most commonly surgical critical care) and specialty certification surgical critical care. General surgeons must be able to deal initially with almost any surgical emergency. Often, they are the first port of call to critically ill or gravely injured patients, and must perform a variety of procedures to stabilize such patients, such as thoracostomy, [[cricothyroidotomy]], compartment fasciotomies and emergency [[laparotomy]] or [[thoracotomy]] to [[wikt:stanch|stanch]] bleeding. They are also called upon to staff surgical intensive care units or trauma intensive care units. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nAll general surgeons are trained in emergency surgery. Bleeding, infections, bowel obstructions and organ perforations are the main problems they deal with. [[Cholecystectomy]], the surgical removal of the gallbladder, is one of the most common surgical procedures done worldwide. This is most often done electively, but the gallbladder can become acutely inflamed and require an emergency operation. Infections and rupture of the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] and small bowel obstructions are other common emergencies.\n\n===Laparoscopic surgery===\n{{Main|Laparoscopic surgery}}\nThis is a relatively new specialty dealing with minimal access techniques using cameras and small instruments inserted through 3 to 15mm  incisions. [[Robotic surgery]] is now evolving from this concept (see below). Gallbladders, appendices, and colons can all be removed with this technique. Hernias are also able to be repaired laparoscopically. [[Bariatric surgery]] can be performed laparoscopically and there a benefits of doing so to reduce wound complications in [[obese]] patients. General surgeons that are trained today are expected to be proficient in laparoscopic procedures.\n\n===Colorectal surgery===\n{{Main|Colorectal surgery}}\nGeneral surgeons treat a wide variety of major and minor colon and rectal diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (such as [[ulcerative colitis]] or [[Crohn's disease]]), [[diverticulitis]], colon and rectal cancer, gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhoids.\n\n===Breast surgery===\n{{Main|Breast surgery}}\nGeneral surgeons perform a majority of all non-cosmetic breast surgery from lumpectomy to [[mastectomy]], especially pertaining to the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of [[breast cancer]].\n\n===Vascular surgery===\n{{Main|Vascular surgery}}\nGeneral surgeons can perform vascular surgery if they receive special training and certification in vascular surgery. Otherwise, these procedures are performed by vascular surgery specialists. However, general surgeons are capable of treating minor vascular disorders.\n\n===Endocrine surgery===\n{{Main|Endocrine surgery}}\nGeneral surgeons are trained to remove all or part of the thyroid and [[parathyroid gland]]s in the neck and the [[adrenal glands]] just above each [[Kidney (organ)|kidney]] in the abdomen. In many communities, they are the only surgeon trained to do this. In communities that have a number of subspecialists, other subspecialty surgeons may assume responsibility for these procedures.\n\n===Transplant surgery===\n{{Main|Transplant surgery}}\n\nResponsible for all aspects of pre-operative, operative, and post-operative care of abdominal organ transplant patients.  Transplanted organs include liver, kidney, pancreas, and more rarely small bowel.\n\n===Surgical oncology===\n{{Main|Surgical oncology}}\n\nSurgical oncologist refers to a general surgical oncologist (a specialty of a general surgeon), but thoracic surgical oncologists, gynecologist and so forth can all be considered surgeons who specialize in treating cancer patients.  The importance of training surgeons who sub-specialize in cancer surgery lies in evidence, supported by a number of clinical trials, that outcomes in surgical cancer care are positively associated to surgeon volume\u2014i.e., the more cancer cases a surgeon treats, the more proficient he or she becomes, and his or her patients experience improved survival rates as a result. This is another controversial point, but it is generally accepted\u2014even as common sense\u2014that a surgeon who performs a given operation more often, will achieve superior results when compared with a surgeon who rarely performs the same procedure. This is particularly true of complex cancer resections such as [[pancreaticoduodenectomy]] for pancreatic cancer, and [[gastrectomy]] with extended (D2) lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer. Surgical oncology is generally a 2 year fellowship following completion of a general surgery residency (5-7 years).\n\n===Cardiothoracic surgery===\n{{Main|Cardiothoracic surgery}}\n\nMost cardiothoracic surgeons in the U.S. (D.O. or M.D.) first complete a general surgery residency (typically 5\u20137 years), followed by a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship (typically 2\u20133 years).\n\n===Pediatric surgery=== \n{{Main|Pediatric surgery}}\n\nPediatric surgery is a subspecialty of general surgery. Pediatric surgeons do surgery on patients age lower than 18. pediatric surgery is 5\u20137 years of residency and a 2-3 year fellowship.\n\n==Trends==\nIn the 2000s [[minimally invasive surgery]] became more prevalent. Considerable enthusiasm has been built around [[robotic surgery]] (also known as ''robotic-assisted surgery''), despite a lack of data suggesting it has significant benefits that justify its cost.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lunca S|author2=Bouras G|author3=Stanescu AC |title=Gastrointestinal robot-assisted surgery. A current perspective |journal=Romanian journal of gastroenterology |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=385\u201391 |date=2005 |pmid=16400356 }}</ref>\n\n==Training==\nIn Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States general surgery is a five to seven year [[resident (medicine)|residency]] and follows completion of [[medical school]], either [[Doctor of Medicine|MD, MBBS, MBChB]], or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]] degrees. In Australia and New Zealand, a residency leads to eligibility for Fellowship of the [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]]. In Canada, residency leads to eligibility for certification by and Fellowship of the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]], while in the United States, completion of a residency in general surgery leads to eligibility for board certification by the [[American Board of Surgery]] or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Surgery]] which is also required upon completion of training for a general surgeon to have operating privileges at most hospitals in the United States.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], surgical trainees enter training after five years of medical school and two years of the [[Foundation Programme]]. During the two to three-year core training programme, doctors will sit the Membership of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] (MRCS) examination. On award of the MRCS examination, surgeons may hold the title '[[Mr.|Mister]]' or '[[Miss]]/[[Ms.]]/[[Mrs]]' rather than doctor. This is a tradition dating back hundreds of years in the United Kingdom from when only physicians attended medical school and surgeons did not, but were rather associated with [[barber]]s in the [[Barber_surgeon|Barber Surgeon\u2019s]] Guild. The tradition is also present in many [[Commonwealth_of_Nations|Commonwealth]] countries including [[New Zealand]] and some states of [[Australia]]. Trainees will then go onto Higher Surgical Training (HST), lasting a further five to six years. During this time they may choose to subspecialise. Before the end of HST, the examination of Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) must be taken in general surgery plus the subspeciality. Upon completion of training, the surgeon will become a consultant surgeon and will be eligible for entry on the [[General_Medical_Council|GMC]] Specialist Register and may work both in the NHS and independent sector as a consultant general surgeon.

She later became an advocate for the conservation of gorillas, and wrote several more books (mainly for children). In the late 1920s and early 1930s, [[Robert Yerkes]] and his wife Ava helped further the study of gorillas when they sent Harold Bigham to Africa. Yerkes also wrote a book in 1929 about the great apes.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], [[George Schaller]] was one of the first researchers to go into the field and study primates. In 1959, he conducted a systematic study of the mountain gorilla in the wild and published his work. Years later, at the behest of [[Louis Leakey]] and the ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'', [[Dian Fossey]] conducted a much longer and more comprehensive study of the mountain gorilla.

In the Dark Times (occasionally mentioned in the televised serials such as ''[[The Five Doctors]]''), Gallifrey was at the centre of an empire covering dozens of worlds and continually being extended by heroes such as Prydonius (whom the Time Lord chapter is named after). Ancient Gallifreyans are all telepathic and were ruled by a female cult centred on a figure called the Pythia, who controlled the population through mysticism and prophecies. When the prophetic powers of the last of the Pythias failed her, Rassilion, Omega and a shadowy figure known as The Other seized power in the name of science and rationality. Seeing this, the Pythia committed suicide and cursed Gallifrey, killing all children in their wombs and making the world sterile. To combat this, Rassilion restructured society and used genetic looms to create new generations of Gallifreyans, who emerge from the looms as fully grown adults. Each of the Great Houses is allotted a total of forty-five cousins and given a regeneration cycle of thirteen lives. The Houses themselves are to some degree alive, in the same way TARDISes are, and the furniture can move about, occasionally growing into 'Drudges' who function as servants for the family. [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] was loomed in the House of Lungbarrow in the mountains of South Gallifrey, but unique among the house's cousins, he has a belly button.<ref name=\"times crucible\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Platt |first=Marc |authorlink=Marc Platt (writer) |date=20 March 1997 |title=Lungbarrow |titlelink=Lungbarrow |series=[[Virgin New Adventures]] |url= |location= |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |page= |isbn=0-426-20502-2 |access-date= }}</ref> This sterility backstory is contradicted by on screen depictions and descriptions of [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] and the Doctor as children,<ref name=\"drums\"/><ref name=\"time monster\"/><ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Girl in the Fireplace |episode-link=The Girl in the Fireplace |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Steven (writer) |last=Moffat |author-link=Steven Moffat |first2=Euros (director) |last2=Lyn |author-link2=Euros Lyn |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |date=6 May 2006 |season= |series-no=2 |number=4 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote='''Reinette:''' You're in my memories.

Each country has its own national governing body (BIW) affiliated to FIG. Competitive [[artistic gymnastics]] is the best known of the gymnastic events. It typically involves the women's events of vault, uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise as well as the men's events of floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars and horizontal bar.\n\nOther FIG disciplines include [[rhythmic gymnastics]], [[trampolining]] and [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]], [[acrobatic gymnastics]], [[aerobic gymnastics]] and [[parkour]]. Disciplines not currently recognized by FIG include [[wheel gymnastics]], [[aesthetic group gymnastics]], men's rhythmic gymnastics, [[TeamGym]] and [[mallakhamba]]. Participants can include children as young as 20 months old doing kindergym and children's gymnastics, recreational gymnasts of ages 3 and up, competitive gymnasts at varying levels of skill, and world-class athletes.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word gymnastics derives from the common Greek adjective \u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 ({{lang|grc-Latn|[[wikt:\u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2#Ancient|gymnos]]}}),<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dgumna%2Fs \u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project</ref> by way of the related verb \u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9 (''gymnazo''), whose meaning is to \"train naked\", \"train in gymnastic exercise\", generally \"to train, to exercise\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dgumna%2Fzw \u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project</ref> The verb had this meaning, because athletes in ancient times exercised and competed without clothing. It came into use in the 1570s, from Latin gymnasticus, from Greek gymnastikos \"fond of or skilled in bodily exercise,\" from gymnazein \"to exercise or train\" (see gymnasium).\n\n==History==\nGymnastics developed in ancient Greece, in Sparta and Athens, and was used as method to prepare men for warfare. In Sparta, among the activities introduced into the training program was the Agoge or exhibition gymnastics made up of gymnastic elements in the form of the Pyrrhic-a dance in a military style-performed for state dignitaries in the final year of a student's training. The maneuvers were performed naked except for the tools of war. Athens combined this more physical training with education of the mind. At the Palestra, a physical education training center, the discipline of educating the body and educating the mind were combined allowing for a form of gymnastics that was more aesthetic and individual and which left behind the form that focused on strictness, discipline, the emphasis on defeating records, and focus on strength.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Judd|first1=Leslie|last2=De Carlo|first2=Thomas|last3=Kern|first3=Ren\u00e9|title=Exhibition Gymnastics|date=1969|publisher=Association Press|location=New York|page=17}}</ref>\n\nIn the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Germany, two pioneer physical educators&nbsp;\u2013 [[Johann Christoph Friedrich GutsMuths|Johann Friedrich GutsMuths]] (1759\u20131839) and [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] (1778\u20131852)&nbsp;\u2013 created exercises for boys and young men on apparatus they had designed that ultimately led to what is considered modern gymnastics.

From then on until the early 1950s, both national and international competitions involved a changing variety of exercises gathered under the rubric, ''gymnastics'', that included for example, synchronized team floor calisthenics, rope climbing, high jumping, running, and horizontal ladder. During the 1920s, women organized and participated in gymnastics events. The first women's Olympic competition was primitive, only involving synchronized calisthenics and track and field. These games were held in 1928, in Amsterdam.\n\nBy 1954, Olympic Games apparatus and events for both men and women had been standardized in modern format, and uniform grading structures (including a point system from 1 to 15) had been agreed upon. At this time, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] gymnasts astounded the world with highly disciplined and difficult performances, setting a precedent that continues. Television has helped publicize and initiate a modern age of gymnastics. Both men's and women's gymnastics now attract considerable international interest, and excellent gymnasts can be found on every continent.\n\nIn 2006, a new points system for Artistic gymnastics was put into play. With an A Score (or D score) being the difficulty score, which as of 2009 is based on the top 8 high scoring elements in a routine (excluding Vault). The B Score (or E Score), is the score for execution, and is given for how well the skills are performed.<ref name=\"usagym.org\">{{cite web|url=https://usagym.org/pages/events/pages/fig_scoring.html|title=USA Gymnastics - FIG \u00d7Elite/International Scoring|work=usagym.org}}</ref>\n\n==<span id=\"International competitive gymnastics\"></span>FIG-recognized disciplines==\n{{See also|List of gymnastics competitions|Major achievements in gymnastics by nation}}\nThe following disciplines are governed by FIG.\n\n===Artistic gymnastics===\n{{Main|Artistic gymnastics}}\n\nArtistic Gymnastics is usually divided into Men's and Women's Gymnastics. Men compete on six events: [[Floor Exercise]], [[Pommel Horse]], [[Still Rings]], [[Vault (gymnastics)|Vault]], [[Parallel Bars]], and [[Horizontal Bar]], while women compete on four: [[Vault (gymnastics)|Vault]], [[Uneven Bars]], [[Balance Beam]], and [[Floor Exercise]]. In some countries, women at one time competed on the rings, high bar, and parallel bars (for example, in the 1950s in the [[USSR]]).\n\nIn 2006, FIG introduced a new points system for Artistic gymnastics in which scores are no longer limited to 10 points. The system is used in the US for elite level competition.<ref name=\"usagym.org\"/> Unlike the old code of points, there are two separate scores, an execution score and a difficulty score. In the previous system, the \"execution score\" was the only score. It was and still is out of 10.00, except for short exercises. During the gymnast's performance, the judges deduct this score only. A fall, on or off the event, is a 1.00 deduction, in elite level gymnastics. The introduction of the difficulty score is a significant change. The gymnast's difficulty score is based on what elements they perform and is subject to change if they do not perform or complete all the skills, or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another. Connection bonuses are where deviation happens most common between the intended and actual difficulty scores, as it can be difficult to connect multiple flight elements. It is very hard to connect skills if the first skill is not performed correctly. The new code of points allows the gymnasts to gain higher scores based on the difficulty of the skills they perform as well as their execution. There is no maximum score for difficulty, as it can keep increasing as the difficulty of the skills increase.\n\n====Artistic events for women====\n[[File:PIked Tsukahara L9 Reginals.jpg|thumb|upright|Piked Tsukahara vault.]]\n\n=====Vault=====\n{{Main|Vault (gymnastics)|l1=Vault}}\n\nIn the vaulting events, gymnasts sprint down a {{convert|25|m|ft}} runway, jump onto a springboard (or perform a roundoff or handspring entry onto a [[Springboard (gymnastics)|springboard]]), land momentarily inverted on the hands on the vaulting horse or vaulting table (pre-flight segment), then propel themselves forward or backward off that platform to a two-footed landing (post-flight segment). Every gymnast starts at a different point on the vault runway depending on their height and strength. The post-flight segment may include one or more multiple saltos, somersaults, or twisting movements. A round-off entry vault, called a [[Yurchenko (vault)|Yurchenko]], is the most common vault in the higher levels in gymnastics. When performing a Yurchenko, gymnasts \"round off\" so their hands are on the runway while their feet land on the springboard. From the roundoff position, the gymnast travels backwards and executes a back handspring so that the hands land on the vaulting table. The gymnast then blocks off the vaulting platform into various twisting and/or somersaulting combinations. The post-flight segment brings the gymnast to her feet. In the lower levels of gymnastics, the gymnasts do not perform this move. These gymnasts will jump onto the springboard with both feet at the same time and either do a front handspring onto the vault or a roundoff onto the vault.\n\nIn 2001, the traditional vaulting horse was replaced with a new apparatus, sometimes known as a tongue, horse or vaulting table. The new apparatus is more stable, wider, and longer than the older vaulting horse, approximately 1 m in length and 1 m in width, giving gymnasts a larger blocking surface. This apparatus is thus considered safer than the vaulting horse used in the past. With the addition of this new, safer vaulting table, gymnasts are attempting more difficult and dangerous vaults.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vault: Everything You Need to know about Vault |url= http://gymnastics.about.com/od/gymnasticsapparatus/p/watchingvault.htm |date= |accessdate=2009-10-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Skubik on Uneven Bars 2006.JPG|thumb|Gymnast on uneven bars.]]\n\n=====Uneven bars=====\n{{Main|Uneven bars|l1=Uneven bars}}\n\nOn the uneven bars, the gymnast performs a timed routine on two parallel horizontal bars set at different heights. These bars are made of [[fiberglass]] covered in wood [[laminate]], to prevent them from breaking. In the past, bars were made of wood, but the bars were prone to breaking, providing an incentive to switch to newer technologies. The width and height of the bars may be adjusted to the size needed by individual gymnasts. In the past, the uneven parallel bars were closer together. The bars have been moved increasingly further apart, allowing gymnasts to perform swinging, circling, transitional, and release moves that may pass over, under, and between the two bars. At the Elite level, movements must pass through the handstand. Gymnasts often mount the uneven bars using a [[Springboard (gymnastics)|springboard]] or a small mat. [[MgCO3|Chalk (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)]] and grips (a leather strip with holes for fingers to protect hands and improve performance) may be used by gymnasts performing this event. The chalk helps take the moisture out of gymnasts' hands to decrease friction and prevent rips (tears to the skin of the hands); dowel grips help gymnasts grip the bar.\n\n=====Balance beam=====\n[[File:Dorina B\u00f6cz\u00f6g\u0151, balance beam, 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Dorina B\u00f6cz\u00f6g\u0151]] performing a one arm press hold during her balance beam mount, 2013.]]\n{{Main|Balance beam}}\n\nThe gymnast performs a choreographed routine of up to 90 seconds in length consisting of leaps, acrobatic skills, somersaults, turns and dance elements on a padded beam.

The event requires balance, flexibility, grace, poise, and strength.\n\n=====Floor=====\n[[File:Double ring leap.jpg|thumb|upright|Gymnast doing a stag leap on floor exercise.]]\n{{Main|Floor (gymnastics)|l1=Floor}}\n\nThe event in gymnastics performed on floor is called floor exercise. The English abbreviation for the event in gymnastics scoring is FX. In the past, the floor exercise event was executed on the bare floor or mats such as wrestling mats. The floor event now occurs on a carpeted 12m \u00d7 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of [[plywood]], which is supported by springs generally called a \"spring\" floor. This provides a firm surface that provides extra bounce or spring when compressed, allowing gymnasts to achieve greater height and a softer landing after the composed skill. Gymnasts perform a choreographed routine up to 90 seconds in the floor exercise event; Depending on the level, they may choose their own, or, if known as a \"[http://gymnasticshq.com/whats-the-difference-between-compulsory-and-optional-gymnastics/ compulsory gymnast],\" default music must be played. Levels three to six the music is the same for each levels along with the skills within the routine. However, recently, the levels have switched. Now, levels 6-10 are optional levels and they get to have custom routines made. In the optional levels (levels six to ten) there are skill requirements for the routine but the athlete is able to pick her own music without any words. The routine should consist of tumbling passes, series of jumps, leaps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns, or pivots, on one foot. A gymnast can perform up to four tumbling passes that usually includes at least one flight element without hand support. Each level of gymnastics requires the athlete to perform a different number of tumbling passes. In level 7 in the United States, a gymnast is required to do 2\u20133, and in levels 8\u201310, at least 3\u20134 tumbling passes are required.<ref>{{cite web |title=WAG Code of Points 2009\u20132012 |url=http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1258 |publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |page=29 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219204732/http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1258 |archivedate=2011-12-19 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====Artistic events for men====\n\n=====Floor=====\n{{Main|Floor (gymnastics)|l1=Floor}}\n\nMale gymnasts also perform on a 12meter x 12meter spring floor. A series of tumbling passes are performed to demonstrate flexibility, strength, and balance. Strength skills include circles, scales, and press handstands. Men's floor routines usually have multiple passes that have to total between 60\u201370 seconds and are performed without music, unlike the women's event. Rules require that male gymnasts touch each corner of the floor at least once during their routine.\n\n[[File:Christopher Cameron, 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Chris Cameron (gymnast)|Chris Cameron]] on the pommel horse]]\n\n=====Pommel horse=====\n{{Main|Pommel horse|l1=Pommel Horse}}\n\nA typical pommel horse exercise involves both single leg and double leg work. Single leg skills are generally found in the form of scissors, an element often done on the pommels. Double leg work however, is the main staple of this event. The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus. To make the exercise more challenging, gymnasts will often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning (moores and spindles) or by straddling their legs (Flares). Routines end when the gymnast performs a dismount, either by swinging his body over the horse, or landing after a handstand variation.\n\n=====Still rings=====\n{{Main|Rings (gymnastics)|l1=Still Rings}}\n\nThe rings are suspended on wire cable from a point 5.75 meters from the floor. The gymnasts must perform a routine demonstrating balance, strength, power, and dynamic motion while preventing the rings themselves from swinging. At least one static strength move is required, but some gymnasts may include two or three. A routine ends with a dismount.\n\n=====Vault=====\n{{Main|Vault (gymnastics)|l1=Vault}}\n\nGymnasts sprint down a runway, which is a maximum of 25 meters in length, before hurdling onto a spring board. The gymnast is allowed to choose where they start on the runway. The body position is maintained while \"punching\" (blocking using only a shoulder movement) the vaulting platform. The gymnast then rotates to a standing position. In advanced gymnastics, multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing. Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, the kinesthetic awareness in the air, how well they stuck the landing and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults.\n\n=====Parallel bars=====\n{{Main|Parallel bars|l1=Parallel Bars}}\n\nMen perform on two bars executing a series of swings, balances, and releases that require great strength and coordination. The width between the bars is adjustable dependent upon the actual needs of the gymnasts and usually 2m high,.\n\n=====Horizontal bar=====\n{{Main|Horizontal bar|l1=Horizontal bar}}\n\nA 2.8&nbsp;cm thick steel or fiberglass bar raised 2.5&nbsp;m above the landing area is all the gymnast has to hold onto as he performs giant swings or ''giants'' (forward or backward revolutions around the bar in the handstand position), release skills, twists, and changes of direction. By using all of the momentum from giants and then releasing at the proper point, enough height can be achieved for spectacular dismounts, such as a triple-back salto. [[Grip (gymnastics)|Leather grips]] are usually used to help maintain a grip on the bar.\n\nAs with women, male gymnasts are also judged on all of their events including their execution, [[degree of difficulty]], and overall presentation skills.\n\n====Scoring (code of points)====\n{{Main|Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|l1=Code of Points}}\n\nA gymnast's score comes from deductions taken from their start value. The start value of a routine is based on the difficulty of the elements the gymnast attempts and whether or not the gymnast meets composition requirements. The composition requirements are different for each apparatus; this score is called the D score.<ref>{{cite web |title=WAG Code of Points 2009\u20132012 |url=http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1258 |publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |page=11 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219204732/http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1258 |archivedate=2011-12-19 |df= }}</ref> Deductions in execution and artistry are taken from a maximum of 10.0.

(2010). BasicLanding. 59-67.</ref> This is a critical skill in terms of execution in competition scores, general performance, and injury occurrence. Without the necessary magnitude of energy dissipation during impact, the risk of sustaining injuries during somersaulting increases. These injuries commonly occur at the lower extremities such as: cartilage lesions, ligament tears, and bone bruises/fractures.<ref>Yeow, C., Lee, P., & Goh, J. (2009). Effect of landing height on frontal plane kinematics, kinetics and energy dissipation at lower extremity joints. Journal of Biomechanics , 1967-1973.</ref> To avoid such injuries, and to receive a high performance score, proper technique must be used by the gymnast. \"The subsequent ground contact or impact landing phase must be achieved using a safe, aesthetic and well-executed double foot landing.\"<ref>Gittoes, M. J., & Irin, G. (2012). Biomechanical approaches to understanding the potentially injurious demands of gymnastic-style impact landings. Sports Medicine A Rehabilitation Therapy Technology, 1-9.</ref> A successful landing in gymnastics is classified as soft, meaning the knee and hip joints are at greater than 63 degrees of flexion.<ref name=\"Marinsek, M. 2010\"/>\n\nA higher flight phase results in a higher vertical ground reaction force. Vertical ground reaction force represents external force which the gymnasts have to overcome with their muscle force and affects the gymnasts' linear and angular momentum. Another important variable that affects linear and angular momentum is time the landing takes. Gymnasts can decrease the impact force by increasing the time taken to perform the landing. Gymnasts can achieve this by increasing hip, knee and ankle amplitude.<ref name=\"Marinsek, M. 2010\"/>\n\n===Rhythmic gymnastics===\n[[File:\u00d6verspagat.jpg|thumb|Russian [[Rhythmic gymnastics|rhythmic gymnast]] [[Irina Tchachina]] stretching in her warm-up before practice.]]\n{{Main|Rhythmic gymnastics}}\n\nAccording to FIG rules, only women compete in rhythmic gymnastics. This is a sport that combines elements of [[ballet]], gymnastics, [[dance]], and apparatus manipulation. The sport involves the performance of five separate routines with the use of five apparatus; ball, ribbon, hoop, clubs, rope\u2014on a floor area, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic. There are also group routines consisting of 5 gymnasts and 5 apparatuses of their choice. Rhythmic routines are scored out of a possible 30 points; the score for artistry (choreography and music) is averaged with the score for difficulty of the moves and then added to the score for execution.<ref>F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique, Code of Points&nbsp;\u2013 Rhythmic Gymnastics 2009\u20132012</ref>\n\nInternational competitions are split between Juniors, under sixteen by their year of birth; and Seniors, for women sixteen and over again by their year of birth. Gymnasts in Russia and Europe typically start training at a very young age and those at their peak are typically in their late teens (15\u201319) or early twenties. The largest events in the sport are the [[Olympic Games]], [[World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]], [[Rhythmic Gymnastics European Championships|European Championships]], [[Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup|World Cup]] and [[Rhythmic Gymnastics Grand Prix Series|Grand-Prix Series]]. The first World Championships were held in 1963 with its first appearance at the Olympics in 1984.\n\n====Rhythmic gymnastics apparatus====\n[[File:Evgenia Kanaeva 2012 in Hard.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Evgenia Kanaeva]] doing a [[Split leap]] in her hoop routine]]\n[[File:Galima Shugurova 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|Soviet [[Galima Shugurova|Galina Shugurova]] performing an Attitude balance in her ball apparatus]]\n\n; [[Ball (rhythmic gymnastics)|Ball]]: It is made of either rubber or synthetic material (pliable plastic) provided it possesses the same elasticity as rubber. It is from 18 to 20&nbsp;cm in diameter and must have a minimum weight of 400g. The ball can be of any colour and should rest in the gymnast's hand, not the wrist. Fundamental elements of a ball routine include throwing, bouncing, and rolling. The gymnast must use both hands and work on the whole floor area while showing continuous flowing movement. The ball is to emphasize the gymnast's flowing lines and body difficulty.\n; [[Hoop (rhythmic gymnastics)|Hoop]]: A hoop is an apparatus in rhythmic gymnastics and may be made of plastic or wood, provided that it retains its shape during the routine. The interior diameter is from 51 to 90&nbsp;cm, and the hoop must weigh a minimum of 300g. The hoop may be of a natural colour or be partially of fully covered by one or several colours, and it may be covered with adhesive tape either of the same or different colour as the hoop. Fundamental requirements of a hoop routine include rotation around the hand or body and rolling, as well as swings, circles, throws, and passes through and over the hoop. The routines in hoop involves mastery in both apparatus handling and body difficulty like leaps, jumps and pivots.\n; [[Ribbon (rhythmic gymnastics)|Ribbon]]: It is made of satin or another similar material cloth of any colour and may be multi-coloured as well as have designs on it. The ribbon itself must be at least 35g (1&nbsp;oz), 4\u20136&nbsp;cm (1.6\u20132.4\") in width and for senior category a minimum length of 6m (20') (5m (16.25') for juniors). The ribbon must be in one piece. The end that is attached to the stick is doubled for a maximum length of 1m (3'). This is stitched down both sides. At the top, a very thin reinforcement or rows of machine stitching for a maximum length of 5&nbsp;cm is authorized. This extremity may end in a strap, or have an eyelet (a small hole, edged with buttonhole stitch or a metal circle), to permit attaching the ribbon. The ribbon is fixed to the stick by means of a supple attachment such as thread, nylon cord, or a series of articulated rings. The attachment has a maximum length of 7&nbsp;cm (2.8\"), not counting the strap or metal ring at the end of the stick where it will be fastened. Compulsory elements for the ribbon include flicks, circles, snakes and spirals, and throws. It requires a high degree of co-ordination to form the spirals and circles as any knots which may accidentally form in the ribbon are penalised. During a ribbon routine, large, smooth and flowing movements are looked for.\n; [[Juggling club|Clubs]]: Multi-piece clubs are the most popular clubs. The club is built along an internal rod, providing a base on which a handle made of polyolefin plastic is wrapped, providing an airspace between it and the internal rod. This airspace provides flex, cushioning impact, making the club softer on the hands. Foam ends and knobs further cushion the club. Multi-piece clubs are made in both a thin European style or larger bodied American style and in various lengths, generally ranging from 19 to 21 inches (480 to 530&nbsp;mm). The handles and bodies are typically wrapped with decorative plastics and tapes. The skills involved are apparatus mastery and body elements, Clubs are thrown from alternate hands; each passes underneath the other clubs and is caught in the opposite hand to the one from which it was thrown. At its simplest, each club rotates once per throw, the handle moving down and away from the throwing hand at first. However, double and triple spins are frequently performed, allowing the club to be thrown higher for more advanced patterns and to allow tricks such as 360s to be performed underneath.\n\n===Trampolining and tumbling===\n[[File:WAGC DMT.jpg|thumb|upright|Double mini-trampoline competitor]]\n{{Main|Trampolining|Tumbling (gymnastics)}}\n\n====Trampolining====\nTrampolining and tumbling consists of four events, individual and synchronized trampoline, double mini trampoline, and tumbling (also known as power tumbling or rod floor). Since 2000, individual trampoline has been included in the Olympic Games. The first World Championships were held in 1964.\n\n=====Individual trampoline=====\nIndividual routines in trampolining involve a build-up phase during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height, followed by a sequence of ten bounces without pause during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial skills. Routines are marked out of a maximum score of 10 points. Additional points (with no maximum at the highest levels of competition) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves and the length of time taken to complete the ten skills which is an indication of the average height of the jumps. In high level competitions, there are two preliminary routines, one which has only two moves scored for difficulty and one where the athlete is free to perform any routine. This is followed by a final routine which is optional. Some competitions restart the score from zero for the finals, other add the final score to the preliminary results.\n\n=====Synchronized trampoline=====\nSynchronized trampoline is similar except that both competitors must perform the routine together and marks are awarded for synchronization as well as the form and difficulty of the moves.\n\n=====Double-mini trampoline=====\nDouble mini trampoline involves a smaller trampoline with a run-up, two scoring moves are performed per routine. Moves cannot be repeated in the same order on the double-mini during a competition. Skills can be repeated if a skill is competed as a mounter in one routine and a dismount in another. The scores are marked in a similar manner to individual trampoline.\n\n====Tumbling====\nIn tumbling, athletes perform an explosive series of flips and twists down a sprung tumbling track. Scoring is similar to trampolining. Tumbling was originally contested as one of the events in Men's Artistic Gymnastics at the [[Gymnastics at the 1932 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tumbling|1932 Summer Olympics]], and in 1955 and 1959 at the [[Gymnastics at the Pan American Games|Pan American Games]]. From [[1974 World Sports Acrobatics Championships|1974]] to [[1998 World Sports Acrobatics Championships|1998]] it was included as an event for both genders at the [[Acrobatic Gymnastics World Championships]]. The event has also been contested since [[1976 Trampoline World Championships|1976]] at the [[Trampoline World Championships]]. Since the recognition of Trampoline and Acrobatic Gymnastics as FIG disciplines in 1999, official Tumbling competitions are only allowed as an event in Trampoline gymnastics meets.\n\n===Acrobatic gymnastics===\n[[File:Acro-tcd.JPG|thumb|upright|Acrobatic Women's Pair performing a skill.]]\n{{Main|Acrobatic gymnastics}}\nAcrobatic gymnastics (formerly Sport Acrobatics), often referred to as \"Acro\" if involved with the sport, acrobatic sports or simply sports acro, is a group gymnastic discipline for both men and women. Acrobats in groups of two, three and four perform routines with the heads, hands and feet of their partners. They may, subject to regulations (e.g. no lyrics), pick their own music.\n\nThere are four international age categories: 11-16, 12-18, 13-19, and Senior (15+), which are used in the World Championships and many other events around the world, including European Championships and World Games. All levels require a balance and dynamic routine; 12-18, 13-19, and Seniors are also required to perform a final (combined) routine.\n\nCurrently, acrobatic gymnastics is marked out of 30.00 (can be higher at Senior FIG level based on difficulty):\n*10.00 for routine difficulty (valued from the tables of difficulties)\n*10.00 for technical performance (how well the skills are executed)\n*10.00 for artistry (the overall performance of the routine, namely choreography)\n\nThe events consist of:\n*Women's Pairs\n*Mixed Pairs\n*Men's Pairs\n*Women's Group of 3\n*Men's Group of 4\n\nMost competitions require a balance and dynamic routine for each event, though some will do a single mixed event.\n\nThe World Championships have been held since 1974.\n\n===Aerobic gymnastics===\n{{Main|Aerobic gymnastics}}\nAerobic gymnastics (formally Sport Aerobics) involves the performance of routines by individuals, pairs, trios or groups up to 6 people, emphasizing strength, flexibility, and aerobic fitness rather than acrobatic or balance skills. Routines are performed for all individuals on a 7x7m floor and also for 12\u201314 and 15-17 trios and mixed pairs. From 2009, all senior trios and mixed pairs were required to be on the larger floor (10x10m), all groups also perform on this floor. Routines generally last 60\u201390 seconds depending on age of participant and routine category. The World Championships have been held since 1995.\n\nThe events consist of:\n*Individual Women\n*Individual Men\n*Mixed Pairs\n*Trios\n*Groups\n*Dance\n*Step\n\n===Parkour===\n{{Main|Parkour}}\nOn January 28, 2018 Parkour was given the go ahead to begin development as a FIG sport.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parkour|url=http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/site/page/view?id=933|website=We Are Gymnastics FIG GYMNASTICS.COM|publisher=FIG/International Gymnastics Federations}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Parkour Rules|url=http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/site/rules/disciplines/pk|website=We Are Gymnastics FIG GYMNASTICS.COM|publisher=FIG|accessdate=5 February 2018}}</ref> The FIG is planning to run World Cup competitions from 2018 onwards and will hold the first Parkour World Championships in 2020.\n\nThe events consist of:\n*Speedrun\n*Freestyle\n\n==Other disciplines==\nThe following disciplines are not currently recognized by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique]].\n\n===Aesthetic group gymnastics===\n{{Main|Aesthetic group gymnastics}}\n\nAesthetic Group Gymnastics (AGG) was developed from the Finnish \"naisvoimistelu\". It differs from Rhythmic Gymnastics in that body movement is large and continuous and teams are larger. Athletes do not use apparatus in international AGG competitions compared to Rhythmic Gymnastics where ball, ribbon, hoop and clubs are used on the floor area. The sport requires physical qualities such as flexibility, balance, speed, strength, coordination and sense of rhythm where movements of the body are emphasized through the flow, expression and aesthetic appeal. A good performance is characterized by uniformity and simultaneity. The competition program consists of versatile and varied body movements, such as body waves, swings, balances, pivots, jumps and leaps, dance steps, and lifts. The International Federation of Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (IFAGG) was established in 2003.<ref name=\"Lajiesittely\">[http://www.voimistelu.fi/voimistelutoiminta/lajit/joukkuevoimistelu/lajiesittely/ Lajiesittely] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621192730/http://www.voimistelu.fi/voimistelutoiminta/lajit/joukkuevoimistelu/lajiesittely/ |date=2014-06-21 }}, Suomen Voimisteluliitto.</ref> The first Aesthetic Group Gymnastics World Championships was held in 2000.<ref>http://www.ifagg.com/competition/world-championships/</ref>\n\n===Men's rhythmic gymnastics===\nMen's rhythmic gymnastics is related to both men's [[artistic gymnastics]] and [[Wushu (sport)|wushu]] [[martial arts]]. It emerged in Japan from stick gymnastics. [[Stick gymnastics]] has been taught and performed for many years with the aim of improving physical strength and health. Male athletes are judged on some of the same physical abilities and skills as their female counterparts, such as hand/body-eye co-ordination, but tumbling, strength, power, and martial arts skills are the main focus, as opposed to flexibility and dance in women's rhythmic gymnastics. There are a growing number of participants, competing alone and on a team; it is most popular in Asia, especially in Japan where high school and university teams compete fiercely. {{As of|2002}}, there were 1000 men's rhythmic gymnasts in Japan.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe technical rules for the Japanese version of men's rhythmic gymnastics came around the 1970s. For individuals, only four types of apparatus are used: the double rings, the stick, the rope, and the clubs. Groups do not use any apparatus. The Japanese version includes tumbling performed on a spring floor. Points are awarded based a 10-point scale that measures the level of difficulty of the tumbling and apparatus handling. On November 27\u201329, 2003, Japan hosted first edition of the Men's Rhythmic Gymnastics World Championship.\n\nThe Events consist of:\n*Stick\n*Clubs\n*Rope\n*Double Rings\n*Group\n\n===TeamGym===\n{{Main|TeamGym}}\n\nTeamGym is a form of competition created by the [[European Union of Gymnastics]], named originally '''EuroTeam'''. The first official competition was held in Finland in 1996. TeamGym events consist of three sections: women, men and mixed teams. Athletes compete in three different disciplines: floor, tumbling and trampette. In common for the performance is effective teamwork, good technique in the elements and spectacular acrobatic skills.<ref>[http://www.british-gymnastics.org/gymnasts/disciplines/teamgym TeamGym], British Gymnastics</ref> There is no World Championships however there has been a European Championships held since 2010.<ref>http://www.ueg.org/en/teamgym-ueg</ref>\n\n===Wheel Gymnastics===\n{{Main|Wheel gymnastics}}\nWheel gymnasts do [[exercise]]s in a large wheel known as the '''Rh\u00f6nrad''', '''gymnastics wheel''', '''gym wheel''', or '''German wheel''', in the beginning also known as '''ayro wheel''', '''aero wheel''', and '''Rhon rod'''.\n\nThere are four core categories of exercise: straight line, spiral, vault and cyr wheel. The first World Championships was held in 1995.<ref>https://www.wheel-gymnastics-wc-2018.com/english/</ref>\n\n===Mallakhamba===\n{{Main|Mallakhamba}}\n'''Mallakhamba''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: \u092e\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0916\u092e\u094d\u092c) is a traditional Indian sport in which a [[gymnast]] performs feats and poses in concert with a vertical wooden pole or rope. The word also refers to the pole used in the sport.\n\nMallakhamba derives from the terms ''malla'' which denotes a wrestler and ''khamba'' which means a pole. Mallakhamba can therefore be translated to English as \"pole gymnastics\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Indian roots to gymnastics|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/othersports/athletics/34909-indian-roots-to-gymnastics|accessdate=|newspaper=NDTV - Sports|date=6 December 2007|location=Mumbai, India}}</ref> On April 9, 2013, the Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] declared mallakhamba as the state sport.\n\n==Non-competitive gymnastics==\nGeneral gymnastics enables people of all ages and abilities to participate in performance groups of 6 to more than 150 athletes. They perform synchronized, choreographed routines. Troupes may consist of both genders and are not separated into age divisions. The largest general gymnastics exhibition is the quadrennial [[World Gymnaestrada]] which was first held in 1939. In 1984 Gymnastics for All was officially recognized first as a Sport Program by the FIG (International Gymnastic Federation), and subsequently by national gymnastic federations worldwide with participants that now number 30 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa-gymnastics.org/pages/group/pages/gymnastics_101.html |title=Gymnastics 101 - Group Gymnastics and Gymnastics For All|publisher=USA Gymnastics |date= |accessdate=2011-12-29}}</ref>\n\n==Former apparatus and events==\n\n===Rope (rhythmic gymnastics)===\n{{Main|Rope (rhythmic gymnastics)|l1=Rope}}\nThis apparatus may be made of hemp or a synthetic material which retains the qualities of lightness and suppleness. Its length is in proportion to the size of the gymnast. The rope should, when held down by the feet, reach both of the gymnasts' armpits. One or two knots at each end are for keeping hold of the rope while doing the routine. At the ends (to the exclusion of all other parts of the rope) an anti-slip material, either coloured or neutral may cover a maximum of 10&nbsp;cm (3.94&nbsp;in). The rope must be coloured, either all or partially and may either be of a uniform diameter or be progressively thicker in the center provided that this thickening is of the same material as the rope. The fundamental requirements of a rope routine include leaps and skipping. Other elements include swings, throws, circles, rotations and figures of eight. In 2011, the [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]] decided to nullify the use of rope in rhythmic gymnastic competitions.\n\n===Rope climbing===\n{{main|Rope climbing}}\nGenerally, competitors climbed either a 6m (6.1m = 20&nbsp;ft in US) or an 8m (7.6m = 25&nbsp;ft in US), 38&nbsp;mm diameter (1.5-inch) natural fiber rope for speed, starting from a seated position on the floor and using only the hands and arms. Kicking the legs in a kind of \"stride\" was normally permitted. Many gymnasts can do this in the straddle or pike position, which eliminates the help generated from the legs though it can be done with legs as well.\n\n===Flying rings===\n{{main|Flying rings}}\nFlying rings was an event similar to [[still rings]], but with the performer executing a series of stunts while swinging. It was a gymnastic event sanctioned by both the [[NCAA]] and the [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] until the early 1960s.\n\n===Club Swinging===\nClub Swinging a.k.a. Indian Clubs was an event in Men's Artistic Gymnastics sometimes up until the 1950s. It was similar to the clubs in both Women's and Men's Rhythmic Gymnastics but much simpler with few throws allowed. It was practice. It was competed in the 1904 and 1932 summer Olympic Games.\n\n===Other (men's artistic)===\n*Team horizontal bar and parallel bar in the 1896 Summer Olympics\n*Team free and Swedish system in the 1912 and 1920 Summer Olympics\n*Combined and triathlon in the 1904 Summer Olympics\n*Side horse vault in 1924 Summer Olympics\n*Tumbling in the 1932 Summer Olympics\n\n===Other (women's artistic)===\n*Team exercise at the 1928, 1936, and 1948 Summer Olympics\n*Parallel bars at the 1938 World Championships\n*Team portable apparatus at the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics\n\n==Health and safety==\n\nGymnastics is one of the most dangerous sports, with a very high injury rate seen in girls age 11 to 18.<ref name=\":0\" />  Compared to athletes who play other sports, gymnasts are at

It was the only modern [[species]] in the [[genus]] '''''Pinguinus'''''. It is not closely related to the birds now known as [[penguin]]s, which were discovered later and so named by sailors because of their physical resemblance to the great auk.\n\nIt bred on rocky, isolated islands with easy access to the ocean and a plentiful food supply, a rarity in nature that provided only a few breeding sites for the great auks. When not breeding, they spent their time foraging in the waters of the [[North Atlantic]], ranging as far south as northern Spain and along the coastlines of Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Ireland, and Great Britain.\n\nThe great auk was {{convert|75|to|85|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall and weighed about {{convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, making it the second-largest member of the alcid family (''[[Miomancalla]]'' was larger).<ref>Smith, N. 2015. Evolution of body mass in the Pan-Alcidae (Aves, Charadriiformes): the effects of combining neontological and paleontological data. Paleobiology. doi: 10.1017/pab.2015.24</ref> It had a black back and a white belly. The black [[beak]] was heavy and hooked, with grooves on its surface. During summer, great auk plumage showed a white patch over each eye. During winter, the great auk lost these patches, instead developing a white band stretching between the eyes. The wings were only {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, rendering the bird flightless. Instead, the great auk was a powerful swimmer, a trait that it used in hunting. Its favourite prey were fish, including [[Atlantic menhaden]] and [[capelin]], and [[crustacean]]s. Although agile in the water, it was clumsy on land. Great auk pairs mated for life. They nested in extremely dense and social colonies, laying one egg on bare rock. The egg was white with variable brown marbling. Both parents participated in the incubation of the egg for around 6 weeks before the young hatched. The young left the nest site after 2\u20133 weeks, although the parents continued to care for it.\n\nThe great auk was an important part of many Native American cultures, both as a food source and as a symbolic item. Many [[Maritime Archaic]] people were buried with great auk bones. One burial discovered included someone covered by more than 200 great auk beaks, which are presumed to be the remnants of a cloak made of great auk skins. Early European explorers to the Americas used the great auk as a convenient food source or as fishing bait, reducing its numbers. The bird's [[Down feather|down]] was in high demand in Europe, a factor that largely eliminated the European populations by the mid-16th century. Scientists soon began to realize that the great auk was disappearing and it became the beneficiary of many early environmental laws, but this proved ineffectual.\n\nIts growing rarity increased interest from European museums and private collectors in obtaining skins and eggs of the bird. On 3 June 1844, the last two confirmed specimens were killed on [[Eldey]], off the coast of Iceland, ending the last known breeding attempt. Later reports of roaming individuals being seen or caught are unconfirmed. A record of one great auk in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of a member of the species. The great auk is mentioned in several novels and the scientific journal of the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] is named ''[[The Auk]]'' in honour of this bird.\n\n==Taxonomy and evolution==\n[[File:Pinguinus alfrednewtoni (fossil auk leg bone).jpg|thumb|left|Fossil [[humerus]] of the [[Miocene]] relative ''Pinguinus alfrednewtoni'']] \nAnalysis of [[mtDNA]] [[DNA sequence|sequences]] has confirmed [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[biogeography|biogeographical]] studies suggesting that the [[razorbill]] is the closest living relative of the great auk.<ref name=\"Moum\">{{cite journal | last = Moum | first = Truls| author2 = Arnason, Ulfur |author3 = \u00c1rnason, Einar | title = Mitochondrial DNA sequence evolution and phylogeny of the Atlantic Alcidae, including the extinct Great Auk (''Pinguinus impennis'') | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 19 | issue = 9 | pages = 1434\u20131439 | year = 2002| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford| url = http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/19/9/1434.pdf| accessdate = 8 May 2009 | pmid = 12200471 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004206}}</ref> The great auk also was related closely to the [[little auk]] (dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to ''Pinguinus''. Due to its outward similarity to the razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the great auk often was placed in the genus ''Alca'', following Linnaeus.\n\nThe fossil record (especially the [[sister species]], ''Pinguinus alfrednewtoni'') and molecular evidence show that the three closely related genera diverged soon after their common ancestor, a bird probably similar to a stout [[Xantus's murrelet]], had spread to the coasts of the Atlantic. Apparently, by that time, the murres, or Atlantic [[guillemot]]s, already had split from the other Atlantic alcids.

It was first introduced in the board game ''[[White Bear and Red Moon]]'' (1975) by [[Chaosium]], and thereafter in a number of other board, roleplaying and computer games, including ''[[RuneQuest]]'' and ''[[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]'', as well as several works of fiction and the computer strategy game ''[[King of Dragon Pass]]''.  The Gloranthan world is characterised by its complex use of mythology, heavily influenced by the universalist approaches of [[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Mircea Eliade]], its [[Robert E. Howard|Howardian]] ethos, its long and distinctive history as a setting for role-playing games, its community development and expansion, and (unusual among early American [[fantasy role-playing]] games) its relative lack of [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkienesque]] influence.\n\nStafford began imagining Glorantha in 1966 as a way to deepen his own understanding of mythology. He founded the company Chaosium to publish the board wargame ''[[White Bear and Red Moon]]'' in 1974 (other sources say 1975), which was set in Glorantha. Chaosium later published other games in the setting, including the critically acclaimed ''[[RuneQuest]]''. Various later editions of ''RuneQuest'', the narrative role-playing game ''[[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]'' (the first edition of which was published as ''[[Hero Wars]]''), and the video game ''King of Dragon Pass'' were also set in Glorantha, as were several prominent fan efforts. Stafford has also explored the Gloranthan setting in the fantasy novel ''King of Sartar''<ref>Stafford Greg, ''King of Sartar'', Berkley Publishing Group, February 1993, {{ISBN|0-933635-99-0}}</ref> and a number of unfinished works published under the collective name of \"the Stafford Library\".\n\nIn Glorantha, magic operates from the everyday level of prayers and charms to the creation and maintenance of the world. Heroes make their way in the world, and may also venture into metaphysical realms to gain knowledge and power, at the risk of body and soul. In the more recent material competing magical outlooks, such as theism, shamanism and mysticism, exist to explain the world. Within each metaphysical system, adherents may also compete - such as when theistic worshipers of rival gods battle each other. The world is flat, with a dome-like sky, and it has been shaped in large and small ways by the mythic actions of the gods. The 'historical' world of Glorantha is in a more or less fallen state, having recovered only partially from a universal battle against Chaos in the mythic Godtime.\n\nHumans are the dominant race, but other sentient beings abound. Some, such as the mystic dragonewts, are unique to Glorantha. Familiar nonhuman races, such as elves and dwarves, are distinct from their common, Tolkienesque portrayals.\n\n== Multimedia Glorantha ==\n\nGlorantha has been; the background for two board-games (''[[White Bear and Red Moon]]''/''Dragon Pass'' and ''Nomad Gods''), two role-playing games (''[[RuneQuest]]'' and ''[[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]''), one video game (''[[King of Dragon Pass]]''), one comic book series (''[[Path of the Damned]]''), five novels or collections of fiction (''King of Sartar'' by ''[[Greg Stafford]]'', ''The Collected/Complete Griselda'' by Oliver Dickinson, ''Gloranthan Visions'' by various authors, and ''The Widow's Tale'' and ''Eurhol's Vale & Other Tales'' by [[Penelope Love]]), and numerous pieces of myth and fiction created by the Glorantha community, featuring in magazines such as ''[[Tales of the Reaching Moon]]''. Several hundred gaming miniatures by various licensees and about a dozen plush toys have also been produced at various times.\n\n== History of the Gloranthan game world ==\n=== Origin and board games (1960s - 70s)===\nGlorantha's origins lie in experiments with mythology, storytelling, and recreation and blending of ancient societies, unlike its contemporary, ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' which has its roots in [[wargaming]].\n\nStafford's first imaginings of Glorantha date back to 1966, when he began his studies at [[Beloit College]], as a vehicle for him to deepen his own understanding of mythology by creating his own mythology. Stafford was greatly influenced by the ideas on mythology of [[Joseph Campbell]], and echoes of Campbell's work are to be found in many aspects of Glorantha; for instance the story of the \"God Learners\" can be seen as an exercise on the implications of Campbell's idea of a unifying [[monomyth]], and the story of Prince Argrath an exploration of Campbell's ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949).  More abstractly, Campbell's idea that myths are how we shape our lives deeply informs the picture of life in Glorantha throughout the game world's publication history.\n\nThe first game system set in Glorantha was the [[board game]] ''[[White Bear and Red Moon]]''.  Stafford first tried to sell the game to established publishers, but despite being accepted by three different game companies, each attempt ended in failure; eventually he founded his own game company in 1974, the influential [[Chaosium]], to publish his game. The game detailed the rise of the barbarian Prince Argrath to defend his homeland of Sartar against the red tide of the civilized Lunar Empire, and filled out the area of ''Dragon Pass''; the game has undergone several reissues since that time.\n\nThe next publication was also a board game, ''[[Nomad Gods]]'', published by Chaosium in 1978, which detailed the raids and wars between the beast-riding spirit-worshiping tribes of Prax, a cursed land to the east of Dragon Pass. A French language edition was published by Oriflam under license from [[Chaosium]] under the name ''Les Dieux Nomades'' in 1994.\n\n=== Role-playing games (late 1970s -)===\nThe first edition of the role-playing game ''[[RuneQuest]]'' was released in 1978. On the back cover of this edition, the game world was called \"''Glorontha''\" (sic). Several later editions were made; the second edition (\"RuneQuest 2\") in 1979 introduced many sophisticated game aids, such as ''[[Cults of Prax]]'' and ''[[Cults of Terror]]'', and highly polished campaign packs, such as ''[[Griffin Mountain]]''. Using materials such as ''Cults of Prax'', players aligned their characters with any of several distinct religions, grounding those characters in the political, cultural, and metaphysical conflicts of Glorantha. Each religion offered a distinct worldview and cultural outlook, none of which are objectively correct. This approach of offering competing mythical histories and value systems continues in current Glorantha material. ''Cults of Terror'' focused on the worship of evil gods and adversaries, such as Vivamort, a [[vampire]] cult, and Lunar and Chaos cults. \n\nIn an attempt to leverage the power of a much bigger gaming company, a third edition, ''RuneQuest 3'', was published with [[Avalon Hill]] in 1984.  This edition both loosened the connection between ''RuneQuest'' and Glorantha, introducing 'Fantasy Europe' as the principal game world for ''RuneQuest'', and much broadened the scope of Glorantha, which was treated as an alternative game world.  Unfortunately, ''RuneQuest'' did not prosper with its association with Avalon Hill, and the relationship between Chaosium, who held the rights to Glorantha, and Avalon Hill, who held the rights to ''RuneQuest'', finally broke down completely in 1995.  A draft of the ''RuneQuest 4'' rules, called ''[[RuneQuest:Slayers]]'', was written but never published. It has since been renamed ''RuneSlayers'' and released as a free download; it is not set in Glorantha.\n\nDuring this period of breakdown, Glorantha continued to evolve. The advent of popular use of the internet caused a boom in fan creations in Glorantha, supported by some unofficial business ventures, such as Reaching Moon Megacorp, and a lively convention scene.  Loren Miller proposed his [[Maximum Game Fun]] principle as a basis for gaming, which soon became a game system in its own right, David Dunham proposed his ''[[PenDragon Pass]]'' system, a nearly freeform game system, and several ambitious [[Freeform role-playing game|freeform]] games were played at conventions, such as ''Home of the Bold'' with up to eighty participants.  The [[video game]] ''[[King of Dragon Pass]]'' was released by [[A Sharp (company)|A Sharp]], allowing the player to play an Orlanthi hero who seeks to unite the clans and tribes of Dragon Pass in a kingdom; the game features exceptional depth of coverage of the area of Dragon Pass, and featured the first compelling public view of Stafford's ideas about the hero quest. Also Stafford was at this time publishing material about the history and mythology of Glorantha in non-game form as books such as ''King of Sartar'' and ''The Glorious (Re)Ascent of Yelm''.\n\n=== Recent years (2000s -) ===\nIn recent years, Gloranthan gaming has been supported by two lines of game systems: the ''[[Hero Wars]]''/''[[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]'' game system, originally published by [[Issaries, Inc.]] in 2000 and now available from [[Moon Design Publications]], and ''[[RuneQuest]]'', originally published by [[Mongoose Publishing]] in 2006 and now available from [[The Design Mechanism]].\n\nThe ''HeroQuest'' game system, written by [[Robin Laws]] in collaboration with Greg Stafford, is radically different from ''RuneQuest'' in that it emphasises [[GNS_Theory#Narrativist|narrativist]] aspects of role-playing; in contrast, ''RuneQuest'' emphasised [[GNS_Theory#Simulationist|simulationist]] aspects. Because of this change in approach some ''RuneQuest'' fans found it difficult to adjust to ''HeroQuest''. However, other long-term fans felt that the game fit Glorantha far better than ''RuneQuest''. A rewritten second edition was published in Spring 2009 by Moon Design Publications, and is being supported with comprehensive Gloranthan sourcebooks: ''Sartar: Kingdom of Heroes'' (2009), ''Sartar Companion'' (2010) and ''Pavis: Gateway to Adventure'' (2012).\n\nThe ''RuneQuest'' game system was licensed to [[Mongoose Publishing]] by [[Issaries, Inc.|Issaries]], allowing Mongoose to publish material concerning the little-explored Second Age of Gloranthan history. Their new fourth edition (''Mongoose RuneQuest'' / MRQ) debuted in August 2006, with many Gloranthan supplements following. A fifth edition (''Mongoose RuneQuest II'' / MRQ2) was published in January 2010, but Mongoose Publishing's licence for Gloranthan material lapsed in May 2011. The ''RuneQuest II'' game system has been retitled \"Legend\", and contains no Gloranthan material. A new company, The Design Mechanism, was formed by the authors of ''RuneQuest II'', and ownership of the Gloranthan supplements produced for the \"RuneQuest II\" line was transferred to them (PDF versions continue to be sold). There are close links between The Design Mechanism and Moon Design Publications, with The Design Mechanism founders writing material for both companies. A new sixth edition of the RuneQuest rules, ''RuneQuest 6'' (RQ6), was published in August 2012, but no Gloranthan material has yet been published.\n\nLatest publication is RuneQuest Roleplaying in Glorantha, published 21 st of september 2018. For a first time the rulebook is written completely in the Glorantha and the rulebook works as basic encyclopedia about the Glorantha. There is already couple new PDF publications to support the rules set and the rules are close enough to RuneQuest second edition to be used with the older material.\n\n== The World of Glorantha ==\n\nThere are a variety of cultures in Glorantha that have strikingly different perceptions of their world, the magic that pervades it and the major events that have shaped it.  \n\nThe Glorantha website<ref>[http://www.glorantha.com]</ref> introduces Glorantha as:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Glorantha is an action-packed world of adventure. Gods and Goddesses struggle here, with nations of people nothing but their pawns. The stormy barbarians with their brutal but honest Storm God struggle against the Lunar Empire, led by the imperial Sun God and devious Moon Goddess.\n<br />\nGlorantha is an exciting world of heroes. Legends are being made by great individuals, many who are not even human beings. Some work with the deities, other heroes and heroines fight against them.\n<br />\nGlorantha is colorful and full of magic. Supernatural animals are found, ranging from unicorns to seven types of merfolk and the Goddess of Lions.\n<br />\nGlorantha is immense. If explored, it has different worlds and dimensions, whole realms where Gods, spirits and sorcerous powers come from.  Unlike many fantasy settings, Glorantha emphasises religion, myth and belief to a level rarely seen in role-playing or fantasy fiction elsewhere.\n<br />\nGlorantha shares some fantasy tropes such as [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]], [[elf|elves]], [[troll]]s, [[giant (mythology)|giants]], but has developed them differently to the more conventional versions based on the work of  [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]. Dwarves are literally made of stone and exist as manifest rigid inflexible laws of creation, while elves are intelligent, mobile plants. Glorantha is full of surprises.\n<br />\nGlorantha is as deep as you want it to be, or not. Hackers and choppers have what they want, while scholars and mythologists have a vast playground of new stories, legends and myths to enjoy.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nThe world of Glorantha has various cultures analogous to Earth spread over two major landmasses and a widespread [[archipelago]]. The northern continent of [[Genertela]] has a caste society of roughly Vedic type to the west, an autocratic Oriental society to the east and a classical style Bronze Age culture in the center. The southern continent of [[Pamaltela]] is somewhat like Africa, but with many differences.\n\n== Specifically Gloranthan creatures ==\n\n'''Broos''' are creatures of chaos. As a result of their ability to mate with anything, they have the body of a man and features of their animal parent, often deer, goats, antelope, cattle, and sheep. The animal parent normally dies with the child eating its way out of the host at full gestation. They worship Malia, the Mother of Disease, and Thed, the goddess of rape and mother of Chaos.<ref>Stafford & Richard (2012), page 97</ref>\n\n'''Scorpionmen''' are belligerent folk, who look like a sort of scorpion-human [[centaur]]. They are described as stupid, vicious and live in violent [[matriarchies]] with a religious emphasis on devouring.  They are chaotic in nature.\n\n'''Ducks''' or ''Durulz'' are large intelligent ducks with arms instead of wings (or men cursed with feathers and webbed feet, depending on your point of view). They reside around rivers, mainly in Sartar, and have an unexplained mystical affinity with Death. \n\n'''Aldryami''' are Gloranthan plantmen, nature and sun worshipping\u2014mainly worshipping Aldrya, deity of plants. Unlike [[Tolkienesque]] [[elves]], they are alien, physically plant-like and often hostile to normal humans (\"meat men'\"). Like many other fictional elf races, they are excellent archers.\n\n'''Mostali''' are a machine-like [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] race, extremely [[xenophobic]], [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] and insular. Inventors of iron, which has many extraordinary magical properties in Glorantha, contrasting to the primary metal used [[bronze]].\n\n'''Uz''', the trolls, are the race of darkness, large, intelligent, astoundingly [[omnivorous]], with a very developed [[sonar]]-like sense (''darksense''). Their societies are matriarchal, and they worship, among others, a goddess of darkness called Kyger Litor, mother of the Trolls, and the more violent and sinister Zorak Zoran. \n\n'''Dragonewts''' are a magical race who comprise several forms of [[neotenic]] [[dragons]], engaged in a cycle of self-improving [[reincarnation]]. They are extremely alien with an incomprehensible mindset. They must have oral surgery in order to speak human languages.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Astinus, 1998.

Deborah Glassman (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010), p. 89.</ref> In 1944, Deleuze went to study at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. His teachers there included several noted specialists in the history of philosophy, such as [[Georges Canguilhem]], [[Jean Hyppolite]], [[Ferdinand Alqui\u00e9]], and [[Maurice de Gandillac]], and Deleuze's lifelong interest in the canonical figures of modern philosophy owed much to these teachers. In addition, Deleuze found the work of non-academic writers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] attractive.<ref>''Dialogues'', p. 12: \"At the Liberation we were still strangely stuck in the history of philosophy.

In 1953, he published his first monograph, ''Empiricism and Subjectivity'', on [[David Hume]]. This monograph was based on his DES thesis (''{{Interlanguage link multi|dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures|fr}}'', roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) which was conducted under the direction of Hyppolite and Canguilhem.<ref>Daniela Voss, ''Conditions of Thought: Deleuze and Transcendental Ideas'', Edinburgh University Press, 2013, p. 76.</ref>  From 1960 to 1964 he held a position at the [[French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|Centre National de Recherche Scientifique]]. During this time he published the seminal ''[[Nietzsche and Philosophy]]'' (1962) and befriended [[Michel Foucault]]. From 1964 to 1969 he was a professor at the [[University of Lyon]]. In 1968 he published his two dissertations, ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (supervised by Gandillac) and ''Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza'' (supervised by Alqui\u00e9).\n\nIn 1969 he was appointed to the [[University of Paris VIII]] at Vincennes/St. Denis, an experimental school organized to implement educational reform. This new university drew a number of talented scholars, including Foucault (who suggested Deleuze's hiring) and the psychoanalyst [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]]. Deleuze taught at [[Vincennes]] until his retirement in 1987.\n\n===Personal life===\nHe married Denise Paul \"Fanny\" Grandjouan in 1956.

Traditionally, difference is seen as derivative from identity: e.g., to say that \"X is different from Y\" assumes some X and Y with at least relatively stable identities (as in Plato's forms). To the contrary, Deleuze claims that all identities are effects of difference. Identities are neither logically nor metaphysically prior to difference, Deleuze argues, \"given that there exist differences of nature between things of the same genus.\"<ref>\"Bergson's Conception of Difference\", in ''Desert Islands'', p. 33.</ref> That is, not only are no two things ever the same, the categories we use to identify individuals in the first place derive from differences. Apparent identities such as \"X\" are composed of endless series of differences, where \"X\" = \"the difference between x and x'\", and \"x'\" = \"the difference between...\", and so forth. Difference, in other words, goes all the way down. To confront reality honestly, Deleuze argues, we must grasp beings exactly as they are, and concepts of identity (forms, categories, resemblances, unities of apperception, predicates, etc.) fail to attain what he calls \"difference in itself.\" \"If philosophy has a positive and direct relation to things, it is only insofar as philosophy claims to grasp the thing itself, according to what it is, in its difference from everything it is not, in other words, in its ''internal difference''.\"<ref>''Desert Islands'', p. 32.</ref>\n\nLike Kant, Deleuze considers traditional notions of space and time as unifying forms imposed by the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]. He therefore concludes that pure difference is non-spatio-temporal; it is an idea, what Deleuze calls \"the virtual\". (The coinage refers to Proust's definition of what is constant in both the past and the present: \"real without being actual, ideal without being abstract.\")<ref>Proust, ''Le Temps Retrouv\u00e9'', ch. III.</ref> While Deleuze's virtual ideas superficially resemble [[Plato]]'s forms and Kant's ideas of pure reason, they are not originals or models, nor do they transcend possible experience; instead they are the conditions of actual experience, the internal difference in itself. \"The concept they [the conditions] form is identical to its object.\"<ref>''Desert Islands'', p. 36.</ref> A Deleuzean idea or concept of difference is therefore not a wraith-like abstraction of an experienced thing, it is a real system of differential relations that creates actual spaces, times, and sensations.<ref>See \"The Method of Dramatization\" in ''Desert Islands'', and \"Actual and Virtual\" in ''Dialogues II''.</ref>\n\nThus, Deleuze at times refers to his philosophy as a '''transcendental empiricism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> ({{lang|fr|empirisme transcendantal}}), alluding to Kant.<ref>Gilles Deleuze, ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'', Continuum, 2004[1968], pp. 56 and 143.</ref><ref>Adrian Parr (ed.), ''The Deleuze Dictionary (Revised Edition)'', Edinburgh University Press, 2010, p. 289: \"Unlike Kant, Deleuze does not conceive of [...] unthought conditions as abstract or necessary philosophical entities, but as contingent tendencies beyond the reach of empirical consciousness.\"</ref> In Kant's [[transcendental idealism]], experience only makes sense when organized by forms of sensibility (namely, space and time) and intellectual categories (such as causality). Assuming the content of these forms and categories to be qualities of the world as it exists independently of our perceptual access, according to Kant, spawns seductive but senseless metaphysical beliefs (for example, extending the concept of causality beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause). Deleuze inverts the Kantian arrangement: experience exceeds our concepts by presenting novelty, and this raw experience of difference actualizes an idea, unfettered by our prior categories, forcing us to invent new ways of thinking (see ''[[#Epistemology|Epistemology]]'').\n\nSimultaneously, Deleuze claims that [[univocity of being|being is univocal]], i.e., that all of its senses are affirmed in one voice. Deleuze borrows the doctrine of ''[[ontological]] [[univocity]]'' from the medieval philosopher [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]]. In medieval disputes over the nature of God, many eminent theologians and philosophers (such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]) held that when one says that \"God is good\", God's goodness is only analogous to human goodness. Scotus argued to the contrary that when one says that \"God is good\", the goodness in question is exactly the same sort of goodness that is meant when one says \"Jane is good\". That is, God only differs from us in degree, and properties such as [[good and evil|goodness]], [[Power (philosophy)|power]], [[reason]], and so forth are univocally applied, regardless of whether one is talking about God, a person, or a flea.\n\nDeleuze adapts the doctrine of univocity to claim that being is, univocally, difference. \"With univocity, however, it is not the differences which are and must be: it is being which is Difference, in the sense that it is said of difference. Moreover, it is not we who are univocal in a Being which is not; it is we and our individuality which remains equivocal in and for a univocal Being.\"<ref>''[[Difference and Repetition]]'', p. 39.</ref> Here Deleuze at once echoes and inverts Spinoza, who maintained that everything that exists is a modification of the one [[substance theory|substance]], [[God]] or [[Nature]]. For Deleuze, there is no one substance, only an always-differentiating [[process philosophy|process]], an origami cosmos, always folding, unfolding, refolding. Deleuze summarizes this ontology in the paradoxical formula \"[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] = [[monism]]\".<ref>''A Thousand Plateaus'', p. 20.</ref>\n\n''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968) is Deleuze's most sustained and systematic attempt to work out the details of such a metaphysics, but his other works develop similar ideas. In ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'' (1962), for example, reality is a play of forces; in ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), a \"[[body without organs]]\"; in ''[[What is Philosophy? (Deleuze and Guattari)|What is Philosophy?]]'' (1991), a \"[[plane of immanence]]\" or \"chaosmos\".\n\n=== Epistemology ===\nDeleuze's unusual metaphysics entails an equally atypical [[epistemology]], or what he calls a transformation of \"the image of thought\". According to Deleuze, the traditional image of thought, found in philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], and [[Edmund Husserl]], misconceives of thinking as a mostly unproblematic business. Truth may be hard to discover\u2014it may require a life of pure theorizing, or rigorous computation, or systematic doubt\u2014but thinking is able, at least in principle, to correctly grasp facts, forms, ideas, etc. It may be practically impossible to attain a God's-eye, [[Objectivity (philosophy)|neutral point of view]], but that is the ideal to approximate: a disinterested pursuit that results in a determinate, fixed truth; an orderly extension of common sense. Deleuze rejects this view as papering over the metaphysical flux, instead claiming that genuine thinking is a violent confrontation with reality, an involuntary rupture of established categories. Truth changes what we think; it alters what we think is possible. By setting aside the assumption that thinking has a natural ability to recognize the truth, Deleuze says, we attain a \"thought without image\", a thought always determined by problems rather than solving them. \"All this, however, presupposes codes or axioms which do not result by chance, but which do not have an intrinsic rationality either. It's just like theology: everything about it is quite rational if you accept sin, the immaculate conception, and the incarnation. Reason is always a region carved out of the irrational\u2014not sheltered from the irrational at all, but traversed by it and only defined by a particular kind of relationship among irrational factors. Underneath all reason lies delirium, and drift.\"<ref>''Desert Islands'', p. 262.</ref>\n\nDeleuze's peculiar readings of the history of philosophy stem from this unusual epistemological perspective. To read a philosopher is no longer to aim at finding a single, correct interpretation, but is instead to present a philosopher's attempt to grapple with the problematic nature of reality. \"Philosophers introduce new concepts, they explain them, but they don't tell us, not completely anyway, the problems to which those concepts are a response. [...] The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has to say what he must have taken for granted, what he didn't say but is nonetheless present in what he did say.\"<ref>''Negotiations'', p. 136.</ref>\n\nLikewise, rather than seeing philosophy as a timeless pursuit of truth, reason, or universals, Deleuze defines philosophy as the creation of [[concept]]s. For Deleuze, concepts are not identity conditions or propositions, but metaphysical constructions that define a range of thinking, such as Plato's [[theory of forms|ideas]], Descartes's ''[[cogito ergo sum|cogito]]'', or Kant's doctrine of the faculties. A philosophical concept \"posits itself and its object at the same time as it is created.\"<ref>''What Is Philosophy?'', p. 22.</ref> In Deleuze's view, then, philosophy more closely resembles practical or artistic production than it does an adjunct to a definitive scientific description of a pre-existing world (as in the tradition of [[John Locke]] or [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]).\n\nIn his later work (from roughly 1981 onward), Deleuze sharply distinguishes art, philosophy, and science as three distinct disciplines, each analyzing reality in different ways. While philosophy creates concepts, the arts create novel qualitative combinations of sensation and feeling (what Deleuze calls \"[[percept]]s\" and \"[[Affect (philosophy)|affects]]\"), and the sciences create quantitative theories based on fixed points of reference such as the [[speed of light]] or [[absolute zero]] (which Deleuze calls \"functives\"). According to Deleuze, none of these disciplines enjoy primacy over the others:<ref>''Negotiations'', p. 123.</ref> they are different ways of organizing the metaphysical flux, \"separate melodic lines in constant interplay with one another.\"<ref>''Negotiations'', p. 125. Cf. Spinoza's claim that the mind and the body are different modes expressing the same substance.</ref> For example, Deleuze does not treat cinema as an art representing an external reality, but as an ontological practice that creates different ways of organizing movement and time.<ref>''[[Cinema 1: The Movement Image]]''</ref> Philosophy, science, and art are equally, and essentially, creative and practical. Hence, instead of asking traditional questions of identity such as \"is it true?\" or \"what is it?\", Deleuze proposes that inquiries should be functional or practical: \"what does it do?\" or \"how does it work?\"<ref>''Negotiations'', p. 21: \"We're strict functionalists: what we're interested in is how something works\".</ref>\n\n=== Values<!--'Society of control', 'Societies of control' and 'Socius (philosophy)' redirect here--> ===\nIn ethics and politics, Deleuze again echoes Spinoza, albeit in a sharply Nietzschean key. In a [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] model of society, morality begins from individuals, who bear abstract [[natural rights]] or duties set by themselves or a God. Following his rejection of any metaphysics based on identity, Deleuze criticizes the notion of an individual as an arresting or halting of differentiation (as the etymology of the word \"individual\" suggests). Guided by the [[Ethical naturalism|naturalistic ethics]] of Spinoza and Nietzsche, Deleuze instead seeks to understand individuals and their moralities as products of the organization of pre-individual desires and powers.<ref>{{Citation | title= Love's Lessons: Intimacy, Pedagogy and Political Community| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Hannah | last2= Stark | journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities | volume= 22 | issue= 4 | pages= 69-79 | year= 2017 | url = https://www.academia.edu/35349930}}</ref>\n\nIn the two volumes of ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' (''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980)), Deleuze and Guattari describe history as a congealing and regimentation of \"[[desiring-production]]\" (a concept combining features of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] drives and [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Labour economics|labor]]) into the modern individual (typically neurotic and repressed), the nation-state (a society of continuous control), and [[capitalism]] (an anarchy domesticated into infantilizing commodification). Deleuze, following [[Karl Marx]], welcomes capitalism's destruction of traditional social hierarchies as liberating, but inveighs against its homogenization of all values to the aims of the market.  \n\nThe first part of ''Capitalism and Schizophrenia'' undertakes a [[universal history]] and posits the existence of a separate '''socius'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (the social body that takes credit for [[Production (economics)|production]]) for each [[mode of production]]: the earth for the [[tribe]], the body of the [[Despotism|despot]] for the [[empire]], and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] for [[capitalism]].\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Gilles Deleuze|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=1 July 2018}}).</ref><ref>Daniel W. Smith, Henry Somers-Hall (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Deleuze'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 137.</ref>\n\nIn his 1990 essay \"Postscript on the Societies of Control\" (\"Post-scriptum sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de contr\u00f4le\"), Deleuze builds on [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s notion of the society of discipline to argue that society is undergoing a shift in structure and control. Where societies of discipline were characterized by discrete physical enclosures (such as schools, factories, prisons, office buildings, etc.), institutions and technologies introduced since World War II have dissolved the boundaries between these enclosures. As a result, social coercion and discipline have moved into the lives of individuals considered as \"masses, samples, data, markets, or 'banks'.\" The mechanisms of modern '''societies of control'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> are described as continuous, following and tracking individuals throughout their existence via transaction records, mobile location tracking, and other [[personally identifiable information]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Deleuze|first1=Gilles|title=Postscript on the Societies of Control|journal=MIT Press|date=October 1992|volume=59|pages=3\u20137|jstor=778828}}</ref>\n\nBut how does Deleuze square his pessimistic diagnoses with his ethical naturalism? Deleuze claims that standards of value are internal or [[Immanence|immanent]]: to live well is to fully express one's power, to go to the limits of one's potential, rather than to judge what exists by non-empirical, transcendent standards. Modern society still suppresses difference and alienates persons from what they can do. To affirm reality, which is a flux of change and difference, we must overturn established identities and so become all that we can become\u2014though we cannot know what that is in advance. The pinnacle of Deleuzean practice, then, is creativity. \"Herein, perhaps, lies the secret: to bring into existence and not to judge. If it is so disgusting to judge, it is not because everything is of equal value, but on the contrary because what has value can be made or distinguished only by defying judgment. What expert judgment, in art, could ever bear on the work to come?\"<ref>''Essays Critical and Clinical'', p. 135.</ref>\n\n=== Deleuze's interpretations ===\nDeleuze's studies of individual philosophers and artists are purposely heterodox. In ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'', for example, Deleuze claims that Nietzsche's ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' (1887) is an attempt to rewrite Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781),<ref>''Nietzsche and Philosophy'', p. 88.</ref> even though Nietzsche nowhere mentions the First Critique in the ''Genealogy'', and the ''Genealogy'''s moral topics are far removed from the epistemological focus of Kant's book. Likewise, Deleuze claims that univocity is the organizing principle of Spinoza's philosophy, despite the total absence of the term from any of Spinoza's works. Deleuze once famously described his method of interpreting philosophers as \"[[buggery]] (''enculage'')\", as sneaking behind an author and producing an offspring which is recognizably his, yet also monstrous and different.<ref>''Negotiations'', p. 6. See also: Daniel W. Smith, \"The Inverse Side of the Structure: Zizek on Deleuze on Lacan\", ''Criticism'' (2004): \"Deleuze's all-too-well-known image of philosophical \"buggery,\" which makes thinkers produce their own \"monstrous\" children\"; Robert Sinnerbrink (in \"Nomadology or Ideology? Zizek\u2019s Critique of Deleuze\", ''Parrhesia'' 1 (2006): 62\u201387) describes the \"popular topic\" of Deleuze's \"notorious remarks\"; Donald Callen (in \"The Difficult Middle\", ''Rhizomes'' 10 (Spring 2005)) describes \"intellectual buggery\" as \"what Deleuze himself famously said about his encounters with the works of other philosophers.\" Deleuze's buggery analogy is also cited by, among many others, Brian Massumi, ''A User's Guide to Capitalism and Schizophrenia'' (MIT Press, 1992), p. 2; Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, ''Organs without Bodies'' (Routledge, 2004), p. 48; Ian Buchanan, ''A Deleuzian Century?''

Deleuze's peculiar readings aim to enact the creativity he believes is the acme of philosophical practice.<ref>''Desert Islands'', p. 144.</ref> A parallel in painting Deleuze points to is Francis Bacon's ''[[Study after Vel\u00e1zquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X|Study after Vel\u00e1zquez]]''\u2014it is quite beside the point to say that Bacon \"gets Velasquez wrong\".<ref>''Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation'', pp. 46f: \"[Bacon] let loose ... presences\" already in Vel\u00e1zquez's painting. Cf. the passage cited above, from ''Negotiations'', p. 136: \"The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has to say what he must have taken for granted, what he didn't say but is nonetheless present in what he did say.\"</ref> Similar considerations apply, in Deleuze's view, to his own uses of mathematical and scientific terms, ''pace'' critics such as [[Alan Sokal]]: \"I'm not saying that [[Alain Resnais|Resnais]] and [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine]], or [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Thom|Thom]], are doing the same thing. I'm pointing out, rather, that there are remarkable similarities between scientific creators of functions and cinematic creators of images. And the same goes for philosophical concepts, since there are distinct concepts of these spaces.\"<ref>''Negotiations'', pp. 124\u2013125.</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nIn the 1960s, Deleuze's portrayal of Nietzsche as a metaphysician of difference rather than a reactionary mystic contributed greatly to the plausibility and popularity of \"left-wing Nietzscheanism\" as an intellectual stance.<ref>See, e.g., the approving reference to Deleuze's Nietzsche study in [[Jacques Derrida]]'s essay \"''Diff\u00e9rance''\", or [[Pierre Klossowski]]'s monograph ''Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle'', dedicated to Deleuze. More generally, see D. Allison (ed.), ''The New Nietzsche'' (MIT Press, 1985), and L. Ferry and A. Renaut (eds.), ''Why We Are Not Nietzscheans'' (University of Chicago Press, 1997).</ref>  His books ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Logic of Sense]]'' (1969) led [[Michel Foucault]] to declare that \"one day, perhaps, this century will be called Deleuzian.\"<ref>Foucault, \"Theatrum Philosophicum\", ''Critique'' 282, p. 885.</ref> (Deleuze, for his part, said Foucault's comment was \"a joke meant to make people who like us laugh, and make everyone else livid.\"<ref>''Negotiations'', p. 4. However, in a later interview, Deleuze commented: \"I don't know what Foucault meant, I never asked him\" (''Negotiations'', p. 88).</ref>)  In the 1970s, the ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'', written in a style by turns vulgar and esoteric,<ref>Sometimes in the same sentence: \"one is thus traversed, broken, fucked by the [[Socius (philosophy)|socius]]\" (''Anti-Oedipus'', p. 347).</ref> offering a sweeping analysis of the family, language, capitalism, and history via eclectic borrowings from Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, and dozens of other writers, was received as a theoretical embodiment of the anarchic spirit of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]].  In 1994 and 1995, ''[[L'Ab\u00e9c\u00e9daire de Gilles Deleuze]]'', an eight-hour series of interviews between Deleuze and [[Claire Parnet]], aired on France's [[Arte]] Channel.<ref>[http://www.langlab.wayne.edu/CStivale/D-G/ABC1.html An English language summary can be found here]</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, almost all of Deleuze's books were translated into English.  Deleuze's work is frequently cited in English-speaking academia (in 2007, e.g., he was the 11th most frequently cited author in English-speaking publications in the humanities, between Freud and Kant).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=405956&sectioncode=26 |title=The most cited authors of books in the humanities |publisher=timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref>  Like his contemporaries Foucault, [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]], Deleuze's influence has been most strongly felt in North American humanities departments, particularly in [[literary theory]], where ''Anti-Oedipus'' and ''A Thousand Plateaus'' are oft regarded as major statements of [[post-structuralism]] and [[postmodernism]],<ref name=\"See 1991\"/> though neither Deleuze nor Guattari described their work in those terms. Likewise in the English-speaking academy, Deleuze's work is typically classified as [[continental philosophy]].<ref>See, e.g., Simon Glendinning, ''The Idea of Continental Philosophy'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2006), p. 54.</ref>\n\nDeleuze has attracted critics as well. The following list is not exhaustive, and gives only the briefest of summaries.\n\nAmong French philosophers, [[Vincent Descombes]] argues that Deleuze's account of a difference that is not derived from identity (in ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'') is incoherent, and that his analysis of history in ''Anti-Oedipus'' is 'utter idealism', criticizing reality for falling short of a non-existent ideal of schizophrenic becoming.<ref>{{cite book|last=Descombes|first=Vincent|title=Modern French Philosophy|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-29672-2|pages=155\u20136, 175\u20138}}</ref>  According to [[Pascal Engel]], Deleuze's metaphilosophical approach makes it impossible to reasonably disagree with a philosophical system, and so destroys meaning, truth, and philosophy itself. Engel summarizes Deleuze's metaphilosophy thus: \"When faced with a beautiful philosophical concept you should just sit back and admire it. You should not question it.\"<ref>Barry Smith (ed.), ''European Philosophy and the American Academy'', p. 34.</ref>  [[Alain Badiou]] claims that Deleuze's metaphysics only apparently embraces plurality and diversity, remaining at bottom [[monism|monist]]. Badiou further argues that, in practical matters, Deleuze's monism entails an ascetic, aristocratic [[fatalism]] akin to ancient [[Stoicism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Badiou|first=Alain|title=Deleuze: the clamor of being|year=2000|publisher=University of Minnesota|location=Minneapolis, MN|isbn=0-8166-3139-5}}</ref>\n\nOther European philosophers have criticized Deleuze's theory of subjectivity.  For example, [[Manfred Frank]] claims that Deleuze's theory of [[individuation]] as a process of bottomless differentiation fails to explain the unity of consciousness.<ref>{{cite book|last=Frank|first=Manfred|title=What Is Neostructuralism?|year=1989|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=385|isbn=978-0816616022}}</ref>  [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] claims that Deleuze's [[ontology]] oscillates between [[materialism]] and [[idealism]],<ref>Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, ''Organs without Bodies'', 2004, pp. 19\u201332, esp. p. 21: \"Is this opposition not, yet again, that of materialism versus idealism? In Deleuze, this means ''The Logic of Sense'' versus ''Anti-Oedipus''.\" See also p. 28 for \"Deleuze's oscillation between the two models\" of becoming.</ref> and that the Deleuze of ''Anti-Oedipus'' (\"arguably Deleuze's worst book\"),<ref>\u017di\u017eek 2004, p. 21</ref> the \"political\" Deleuze under the \"'bad' influence\" of Guattari, ends up, despite protestations to the contrary, as \"the ideologist of late capitalism\".<ref>\u017di\u017eek 2004, pp. 32, 20, and 184.</ref> \u017di\u017eek also calls Deleuze to task for allegedly reducing the subject to \"just another\" substance and thereby failing to grasp the [[nothingness]] that, according to Lacan and \u017di\u017eek, defines [[subjectivity]]. What remains worthwhile in Deleuze's oeuvre, \u017di\u017eek finds, are precisely those concepts closest to \u017di\u017eek's own ideas.<ref>\u017di\u017eek 2004, p. 68: \"This brings us to the topic of the ''subject'' that, according to Lacan, emerges in the interstice of the 'minimal difference,' in the minimal gap between two signifiers. In this sense, the subject is 'a nothingness, a void, which exists.' ... This, then, is what Deleuze seems to get wrong in his reduction of the subject to (just another) substance. Far from belonging to the level of actualization, of distinct entities in the order of constituted reality, the dimension of the 'subject' designates the ''reemergence of the virtual within the order of actuality''. 'Subject' names the unique space of the explosion of virtuality within constituted reality.\"</ref>\n\nEnglish-speaking philosophers have also criticized aspects of Deleuze's work.

They give examples of mathematical concepts being \"abused\" by taking them out of their intended meaning, rendering the idea into normal language reduces it to truism or nonsense. In their opinion, Deleuze used mathematical concepts about which the typical reader might be not knowledgeable, and thus served to display erudition rather than enlightening the reader.

The majority of galaxies are gravitationally organized into [[galaxy group|group]]s, [[galaxy cluster|clusters]], and [[supercluster]]s.

At the [[Large-scale structure of the Cosmos|largest scale]], these associations are generally arranged into [[galaxy filament|sheets and filaments]] surrounded by immense [[void (astronomy)|voids]].<ref name=camb_lss />  The largest structure of galaxies yet recognised is a cluster of superclusters that has been named [[Laniakea Supercluster|Laniakea]], which contains the Virgo supercluster.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gibney | first1 = Elizabeth | year = 2014 | title = Earth's new address: 'Solar System, Milky Way, Laniakea' | url = | journal = Nature | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1038/nature.2014.15819 }}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the word ''galaxy'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term for the Milky Way, ''{{transl|grc|galaxias}}'' (''{{lang|grc|{{linktext|\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}}}'', \"milky one\"), or ''{{transl|grc|[[kyklos]] galaktikos}}'' (\"milky circle\")<ref name=oed /> due to its appearance as a \"milky\" band of light in the sky. In [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] places his son born by a mortal woman, the infant [[Heracles]], on [[Hera]]'s breast while she is asleep so that the baby will drink her divine milk and will thus become immortal. Hera wakes up while breastfeeding and then realizes she is nursing an unknown baby: she pushes the baby away, some of her milk spills, and it produces the faint band of light known as the Milky Way.<ref name=waller_hodge2003 /><ref name=konecny2006 />\n\nIn the astronomical literature, the capitalized word \"Galaxy\" is often used to refer to our galaxy, the [[Milky Way]], to distinguish it from the other galaxies in our [[universe]]. The English term ''Milky Way'' can be traced back to a story by [[Chaucer]] {{circa|1380}}:\n{{Quote|\"See yonder, lo, the Galaxy\u00eb<br />&nbsp;Which men {{linktext|clepe}}th ''the Milky Wey'',<br />&nbsp;For hit is whyt.\"|Geoffrey Chaucer|[[The House of Fame]]''<ref name=oed />}}\n\nGalaxies were initially discovered telescopically and were known as ''[[spiral nebula]]e''. Most 18th to 19th Century astronomers considered them as either unresolved [[star cluster]]s or anagalactic [[nebula]]e, and were just thought as a part of the Milky Way, but their true composition and natures remained a mystery. Observations using larger telescopes of a few nearby bright galaxies, like the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], began resolving them into huge conglomerations of stars, but based simply on the apparent faintness and sheer population of stars, the true distances of these objects placed them well beyond the Milky Way. For this reason they were popularly called ''island universes'', but this term quickly fell into disuse, as the word ''universe'' implied the entirety of existence. Instead, they became known simply as galaxies.<ref name=rao2005 />\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n[[File:Probing the distant past SDSS J1152+3313.tif|thumb|[[Galaxy cluster]] [[SDSS J1152+3313]].

Astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues, such as the [[Messier catalogue]], the NGC ([[New General Catalogue]]), the IC ([[Index Catalogue]]), the CGCG ([[Catalogue of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies]]), the MCG ([[Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies]]) and UGC ([[Uppsala General Catalogue]] of Galaxies). All of the well-known galaxies appear in one or more of these catalogues but each time under a different number.\nFor example, [[Messier 109]] is a spiral galaxy having the number 109 in the catalogue of Messier, but also codes NGC3992, UGC6937, CGCG 269-023, MCG +09-20-044, and PGC 37617.\n\n== Observation history ==\nThe realization that we live in a galaxy which is one among many galaxies, parallels major discoveries that were made about the Milky Way and other [[nebula]]e.\n\n=== Milky Way ===\n{{Main|Milky Way}}\nThe [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] philosopher [[Democritus]] (450\u2013370 BCE) proposed that the bright band on the night sky known as the Milky Way might consist of distant stars.<ref name=\"Plutarch\">{{cite book | title=The Complete Works Volume 3: Essays and Miscellanies | publisher=Echo Library | author=Plutarch | authorlink=Plutarch | date=2006 | location=Chapter 3 | page=66 | isbn=978-1-4068-3224-2| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I34rSPrX1tQC }}</ref>\n[[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BCE), however, believed the Milky Way to be caused by \"the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars that were large, numerous and close together\" and that the \"ignition takes place in the upper part of the [[atmosphere]], in the [[Sublunary sphere|region of the World that is continuous with the heavenly motions]].\"<ref name=Montada>{{cite web\n | last1=Montada |first1=J.

These galaxies have an [[ellipsoid]]al profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little [[interstellar medium|interstellar matter]]. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of [[open cluster]]s and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead they are dominated by generally older, more [[stellar evolution|evolved stars]] that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions.

About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water.

Though farmers had known for millennia that crossbreeding of animals and plants could favor certain desirable [[trait (biological)|traits]], Mendel's [[pea]] plant experiments conducted between 1856 and 1863 established many of the rules of [[biological inheritance|heredity]], now referred to as the laws of [[Mendelian inheritance]].<ref name=\"history.nih.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://history.nih.gov/exhibits/nirenberg/HS1_mendel.htm|title=Nirenberg: History Section: Gregor Mendel|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants: plant height, pod shape and color, seed shape and color, and flower position and color. Taking seed color as an example, Mendel showed that when a true-breeding yellow pea and a true-breeding green pea were cross-bred their offspring always produced yellow seeds. However, in the next generation, the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow. To explain this phenomenon, Mendel coined the terms \u201c[[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]]\u201d and \u201c[[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]]\u201d in reference to certain traits.

At times, Mendel must have entertained doubts about his work, but not always: \"My time will come,\" he reportedly told a friend.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring Mendel's lifetime, most biologists held the idea that all characteristics were passed to the next generation through [[blending inheritance]], in which the traits from each parent are averaged. Instances of this phenomenon are now explained by the action of multiple genes with [[Quantitative genetics|quantitative effects]]. [[Charles Darwin]] tried unsuccessfully to explain inheritance through a theory of [[pangenesis]]. It was not until the early 20th century that the importance of Mendel's ideas was realized.\n\nBy 1900, research aimed at finding a successful theory of discontinuous inheritance rather than [[blending inheritance]] led to independent duplication of his work by [[Hugo de Vries]] and [[Carl Correns]], and the rediscovery of Mendel's writings and laws. Both acknowledged Mendel's priority, and it is thought probable that de Vries did not understand the results he had found until after reading Mendel.<ref name=pb>{{cite book |author=Bowler, Peter J. |title=Evolution: the history of an idea |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-0-520-23693-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Though [[Erich von Tschermak]] was originally also credited with rediscovery, this is no longer accepted because he did not understand [[Mendelian inheritance#Mendel's laws|Mendel's laws]].<ref>{{cite book| author=Mayr E. |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |year=1982 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought |location=Cambridge |publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-36446-2 |page=730}}</ref> Though de Vries later lost interest in Mendelism, other biologists started to establish modern genetics as a science.<ref name=pb/> All three of these researchers, each from a different country, published their rediscovery of Mendel's work within a two-month span in the Spring of 1900.{{sfn|Henig|2000|pp=1\u20139}}\n\nMendel's results were quickly replicated, and genetic linkage quickly worked out.

Grappling covers techniques used in many disciplines, styles and [[martial arts]] that are practiced both as [[combat sport]]s and for [[self-defense]]. \n\nGrappling most commonly does not include [[strike (attack)|striking]] or the use of [[weapons]]. However, some fighting styles or martial arts known especially for their grappling techniques teach tactics that include strikes and weapons either alongside grappling or combined with it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://judoinfo.com/katagosh.htm|title=Judo Self-Defense Forms: Goshin Jutsu|work=judoinfo.com}}</ref>\n\n== Types of  ==\n[[File:Illustrerad Verldshistoria band I Ill 012.jpg|thumbnail|Ancient Egyptian wrestling]]\nGrappling techniques can be broadly subdivided into [[Clinch fighting]]; [[Takedown (grappling)|Takedowns]] and [[Throw (grappling)|Throws]]; [[Submission hold]]s and [[Pin (wrestling)|Pinning or Controlling Techniques]]; and [[Sweep (martial arts)#Ground work|Sweeps]], Reversals, Turnovers, and Escapes.\n* '''Clinching''', or clinch work, takes place with both competitors on their feet using various [[grappling hold#Clinch hold|clinch holds]] applied to the upper body of the opponent. Clinch work is generally used to set up or defend against throws or takedowns.\n* '''Takedowns''' A takedown is used by one grappler to manipulate his opponent from a position where both are initially standing, to a position on the ground. The grappler completing the takedown aims to end on top of the opponent in a position of relative control.\n* '''Throws''': A throw is a technique in which one grappler lifts or off-balances his opponent and maneuvers him forcefully through the air or to the ground. The purpose of throws varies among the different disciplines of grappling with some emphasizing throws with the potential to incapacitate the opponent, while leaving the thrower standing, or to gain a takedown or controlling position.\n* '''Sprawling''': A sprawl is a defensive technique done usually when the opponent attempts a takedown. It is performed by shifting the legs backwards and spread out in one fast motion. If done correctly one will land on their opponent's back and gain control.\n* '''Submission holds''': There are generally two types of submission holds: those that would potentially strangle or suffocate an opponent ([[Choke hold|chokes]]), and those that would potentially cause injury to a joint or other body part ([[Joint lock|locks]]). In sport grappling, a competitor is expected to submit, either verbally or by tapping the opponent, to admit defeat when he is caught in a submission hold that he cannot escape. Competitors who refuse to \"tap out\" risk unconsciousness or serious injury.\n* '''Securing or Controlling Techniques''': A pin involves holding an opponent on his back in a position where he is unable to attack. In some styles of competitive grappling a pin is an instant victory, and in other styles it is considered a dominant position that is rewarded with points. Other controlling techniques are used to hold an opponent face down on the ground or on all fours in order to prevent an escape or attack. Either of these types of technique may also be used as a prelude to a submission hold.\n* '''Escapes''': In a general sense, an escape is accomplished by maneuvering out of danger or from an inferior position; for example when a grappler who is underneath [[side control]] moves to [[guard (grappling)|guard]] or gets back to a neutral standing position, or when a grappler is able to maneuver out of a submission attempt and back to a position where he is no longer in immediate danger of being submitted.\n* '''Turnovers''': used to maneuver an opponent who is on all fours or flat on their stomach to their back, in order to score points, prepare for a pin or in order to gain a more dominant position.\n* '''Reversals or Sweeps''': These occur when a grappler who was underneath his opponent on the ground is able to maneuver so that he gains a top position over his opponent.\n\n== Use ==\nThe degree to which grappling is utilized in different fighting systems varies. Some systems, such as [[amateur wrestling]], [[Pehlwani]], [[Pehlwani]] submission wrestling, [[judo]], [[sumo]], and [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] are exclusively grappling arts and do not allow striking. Many [[combat sports]], such as [[shooto]] and mixed martial arts competitions use grappling while retaining striking as part of the sport<ref name=Warriors>{{cite book\n| last = Krauss\n| first = Erich\n| title = Warriors of the Ultimate Fighting Championship\n| publisher = Citadel Press Inc.,\n| date = 1 December 2004\n| location = U.S.\n| isbn = 0-8065-2657-2}}</ref>\n[[Image:010622-sanford-cooper.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Two [[wrestlers]] engaging.]]\nGrappling is not allowed in some martial arts and combat sports, usually for the sake of focusing on other aspects of combat such as [[Punch (strike)|punching]], [[kick]]ing or [[m\u00eal\u00e9e weapon]]s. Opponents in these types of matches, however, still grapple with each other occasionally when [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigued]] or in [[pain]]; when this occurs, the [[referee]] will step in and restart the match, sometimes giving a warning to one or both of the fighters. Examples of these include [[boxing]], [[kickboxing]], [[taekwondo]], [[karate]], and [[Fencing (sport)|fencing]]. While prolonged grappling in [[muay Thai]] will result in a separation of the competitors, the art extensively uses the [[Grappling hold#Clinch hold|clinch hold]] known as a [[Collar tie#Double collar tie|double collar tie]].\n\nGrappling techniques and defenses to grappling techniques are also considered important in [[self-defense]] applications and in [[Police|law enforcement]]. The most common grappling techniques taught for self-defense are escapes from [[grappling hold|holds]] and application of [[Grappling hold#Pain compliance hold|pain compliance techniques]].\n\nGrappling can be trained for self-defense, sport, and mixed martial arts ([[Mixed martial arts|MMA]]) competition.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Stand-up grappling==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Judo]] -->\n'''Stand-up grappling''' is arguably an integral part of all grappling and [[clinch fighting]] arts, considering that two combatants generally start fighting from a stand-up position. The aim of stand-up grappling varies according to the martial arts or combat sports in question. Defensive stand-up grappling concerns itself with [[Grappling hold#Pain compliance hold|pain-compliance holds]] and escapes from possible [[grappling hold]]s applied by an opponent, while offensive grappling techniques include [[Grappling hold#Submission hold|submission holds]], [[Trapping (martial arts)|trapping]], [[Takedown (grappling)|takedowns]] and [[Throw (grappling)|throws]], all of which can be used to inflict serious damage, or to move the fight to the ground. Stand-up grappling can also be used both offensively and defensively simultaneously with [[Strike (attack)|striking]], either to trap an opponents arms while striking, prevent the opponent from obtaining sufficient distance to strike effectively, or to bring the opponent close to apply, for instance, [[Knee (strike)|knee strikes]].\n\nIn combat sports, stand-up grappling usually revolves around successful takedowns and throws. Grappling is a major part of combat [[glima]] and L\u00f8se-tak sport glima, and the fight continues on the ground if both combatants end up there. In other martial sports such as [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]], the fight may continue on the ground.\n\n[[Image:Gi grappling at Ginowan City Police Station.jpg|thumb|350px|In judo, the aim of ''[[judo#Ground phase|ne-waza]]'' is to obtain a chokehold, joint lock or to pin the opponent.]]\n\n==Ground grappling==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Judo]] -->\n'''Ground grappling''' refers to all the grappling techniques that are applied while the grapplers are no longer in a standing position. A large part of most [[martial art]]s and [[combat sport]]s which feature ground grappling is [[Grappling position|positioning]] and obtaining a dominant position. A dominant position (usually on top) allows the dominant grappler a variety of options, including: attempting to escape by standing up, obtaining a pin or hold-down to control and exhaust the opponent, executing a submission hold, or striking the opponent. The bottom grappler is, on the other hand, concerned with escaping the situation and improving his position, typically by using a sweep or reversal. In some disciplines, especially those where the [[Guard (grappling)|guard]] is used, the bottom grappler may also be able to finish the fight from the bottom by a submission hold. Some people feel more confident on the bottom because of the large number of submissions that can be accomplished from having the opponent in full-guard.\n\n== Applications ==\nWhen unskilled fighters get embroiled in combat, a common reaction is to grab the opponent in an attempt to slow the situation down by holding them still, resulting in an unsystematic struggle that relies on brute force. A skilled fighter, in contrast, can perform takedowns as a way of progressing to a superior position such as a Mount (grappling) or [[side control]], or using clinch holds and ground positions to set up strikes, choke holds, and joint locks. A grappler who has been taken down to the ground can use defensive positions such as the Guard (grappling), which protects against being mounted or attacked. If a grappler is strong and can utilize leverage well, a takedown or throw itself can be a form of dix; the impact can render an opponent unconscious. On the other hand, grappling also offers the possibility of controlling an opponent without injuring them. For this reason, most police staff receive some training in grappling.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Likewise, grappling sports have been devised so that their participants can compete using full physical effort without injuring their opponents.\n\nGrappling is called ''[[dumog]]'' in [[Eskrima]]. The term ''[[chin na]]'' in [[Chinese martial arts]] deals with the use of grappling to achieve submission or incapacitation of the opponent (these may involve the use of [[acupressure]] points). Some Chinese martial arts, [[aikido]], some eskrima systems, the Viking martial art of glima, as well as medieval and Renaissance European martial arts, practice grappling while one or both participants is armed. This practice is significantly more dangerous than unarmed grappling and generally requires a great deal of training.\n\n== Types of grappling ==\nThere are many different regional styles of grappling around the world that are practiced within a limited geographic area or country. Several grappling styles like Sport [[judo]], [[shoot wrestling]], [[catch wrestling]], Grappling, [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], Sport [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] and several types of [[wrestling]] including [[Freestyle Wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman Wrestling|Greco-Roman]] have gained global popularity.  Judo, Freestyle Wrestling, and Greco-Roman Wrestling are [[Olympic Sports]] while Grappling, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Sambo have their own World Championship Competitions.  Other known grappling-oriented systems are [[shuai jiao]], [[malla-yuddha]] and [[aikido]].\n\nIn these arts, the object is either to take down and pin the opponent, or to catch the adversary in a specialized chokehold or joint lock which forces him to submit and admit defeat or be rendered helpless (unconscious or broken limbs). There are two forms of dress for grappling that dictate pace and style of action: with a jacket, such as a ''[[Keikogi|gi]]''<ref name=judogi>{{cite web|url=http://judoinfo.com/obi.htm|title=The Judo Rank System - Belts|work=judoinfo.com}}</ref>  or kurtka, and without (No-Gi). The jacket, or \"gi\", form most often utilizes grips on the cloth to control the opponent's body, while the \"no-''gi''\" form emphasizes body control of the torso and head using only the natural holds provided by the body. The use of a jacket is compulsory in judo competition, sambo competition, and most Brazilian jiu-jitsu competition, as well as a variety of folk wrestling styles around the world. Jackets are not used in many forms of wrestling, such as Olympic Freestyle, Greco-Roman wrestling and Grappling.\n\nGrappling techniques are also used in [[mixed martial arts]] along with striking techniques. Strikes can be used to set up grappling techniques and vice versa.\n\n===ADCC===\nThe [[ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship]] is the most prestigious full range (takedown, position, and submission inclusive) grappling tournament in the world and is only held once every two years.\n\n===Mundials===\nThe [[World Jiu-Jitsu Championship]], also commonly called the Mundials (Portuguese for \"Worlds\"), is the most prestigious jacketed full range (takedown, position, and submission inclusive) grappling tournament in the world. The event also hosts a non-jacketed division (no gi), but that sub-event is not as prestigious as ADCC in terms of pure non-jacketed competition.\n\n===United World Wrestling===\n[[United World Wrestling]] (UWW) is the international governing body for the sport of wrestling. It presides over international competitions for various forms of wrestling, including Grappling for men and women. The flagship Grappling's event of UWW is the Grappling World Championships.\n\n===NAGA===\n'''The North American Grappling Association (NAGA)''' is an organization started in 1995 that holds [[Submission Grappling]] and [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] tournaments throughout [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. NAGA is the largest submission grappling association in the world with over 175,000 participants worldwide, including some of the top submission grapplers and MMA fighters in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nagafighter.com|title=NAGA Submission Grappling, BJJ Tournaments & Reality Fighting - NagaFighter.com|work=nagafighter.com}}</ref> NAGA grappling tournaments consist of [[keikogi|gi]] and no-gi divisions. No-Gi competitors compete under rules drafted by NAGA. Gi competitors compete under standardized [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] rules. Notable Champions Frank Mir, Joe Fiorentino and Anthony Porcelli.\n\n===GRiND===\n'''GRiND''' is the first Indian Pro Grappling tournament series started in May 2017 conducting grappling championships(position and submission included).

The term refers also to the study of such rules, and this field includes [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and [[syntax]], often complemented by [[phonetics]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]].\n\nSpeakers of a language have a set of internalized rules<ref>Traditionally, the mental information used to produce and process linguistic utterances is referred to as \"rules\". However, other frameworks employ different terminology, with theoretical implications. [[Optimality theory]], for example, talks in terms of \"constraints\", while [[construction grammar]], [[cognitive grammar]], and other \"usage-based\" theories make reference to patterns, constructions, and \"schemata\"</ref> for using that language and these rules constitute that language's grammar. The vast majority of the information in the grammar is \u2013 at least in the case of one's [[First language|native language]] \u2013 [[language acquisition|acquired]] not by conscious study or instruction, but by observing other speakers. Much of this work is done during early childhood; learning a language later in life usually involves a greater degree of explicit instruction.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = O'Grady\n | first = William\n | last2 = Dobrovolsky\n | first2 = Michael\n | last3 = Katamba\n | first3 = Francis\n | title = Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction\n | publisher = Longman\n | year = 1996\n | location = Harlow, Essex\n | pages = 4\u20137; 464\u2013539\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=djhsAAAAIAAJ&dq=Contemporary+Linguistics\n | isbn = 9780582246911}}</ref> Thus, grammar is the cognitive information underlying language use.\n\nThe term \"grammar\" can also be used to describe the rules that govern the linguistic behaviour of a group of speakers. The term \"English grammar\", therefore, may have several meanings. It may refer to the whole of English grammar, that is, to the grammars of all the speakers of the language, in which case, the term encompasses a great deal of variation.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n | last = Holmes\n | first = Janet\n | title = An Introduction to Sociolinguistics\n | publisher = Longman\n | year = 2001\n | location = Harlow, Essex\n | edition = second\n | pages = 73\u201394\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=qjdqxecifHcC&dq=Introduction+to+Sociolinguistics+Holmes\n | isbn = 978-0582328617}}; for more discussion of sets of grammars as populations, see: {{Cite book\n | last = Croft\n | first = William\n | authorlink = William Croft (linguist)\n | title = Explaining Language Change: An Evolutionary Approach\n | publisher = Longman\n | year = 2000\n | location = Harlow, Essex\n | pages = 13\u201320\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=5_Ka7zLl9HQC&dq=Explaining+Language+Change+Croft\n | isbn = 978-0582356771}}</ref> Alternatively, it may refer only to what is common to the grammars of all, or of the vast majority of English speakers (such as [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] word order in [[Simple sentence|simple declarative sentences]]). Or it may refer to the rules of a particular, relatively well-defined variety of English (such as [[standard English]] for a particular region).\n\nA specific description, study or analysis of such rules may also be referred to as a grammar. A [[reference book]] describing the grammar of a language is called a \"reference grammar\" or simply \"a grammar\" (see [[History of English grammars]]). A fully explicit grammar that exhaustively describes the [[grammaticality|grammatical]] constructions of a language is called a descriptive grammar. This kind of [[linguistic description]] contrasts with [[linguistic prescription]], an attempt to discourage or suppress some grammatical constructions, while promoting others. For example, [[preposition stranding]] occurs widely in [[Germanic languages]] and has a long history in English. [[John Dryden]], however, objected to it (without explanation),<ref>Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum, 2002, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. Cambridge (UK): Cambridge University Press, p. 627f.</ref> leading other English speakers to avoid the construction and discourage its use.<ref name=\"CB1\">{{cite web| last=Lundin| first=Leigh |title=The Power of Prepositions |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=216 |work=On Writing |publisher=Criminal Brief |location=Cairo |date=23 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOutside linguistics, the term ''grammar'' is often used in a rather different sense. In some respects, it may be used more broadly, including rules of [[orthography|spelling and punctuation]], which linguists would not typically consider to form part of grammar, but rather as a part of [[orthography]], the set of conventions used for writing a language. In other respects, it may be used more narrowly, to refer to [[prescriptive grammar]] only and excluding those aspects of a language's grammar that are not subject to variation or debate.

The [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] tradition originated in [[Abbasid]] [[Baghdad]]. The ''[[Diqduq]]'' (10th century) is one of the earliest grammatical commentaries on the Hebrew Bible.<ref>G. Khan, J. B. Noah, ''The Early Karaite Tradition of Hebrew Grammatical Thought'' (2000)</ref> [[Ibn Barun]] in the 12th century compares the Hebrew language with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic grammatical tradition]].<ref>Pinchas Wechter, Ibn Bar\u016bn's Arabic Works on Hebrew Grammar and Lexicography (1964)</ref>\n\nBelonging to the ''[[trivium]]'' of the seven [[liberal arts]], grammar was taught as a core discipline throughout the [[Middle Ages]], following the influence of authors from [[Late Antiquity]], such as [[Priscian]]. Treatment of vernaculars began gradually during the [[High Middle Ages]], with isolated works such as the [[First Grammatical Treatise]], but became influential only in the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods. In 1486, [[Antonio de Nebrija]] published ''Las introduciones Latinas contrapuesto el romance al Latin'', and the first [[Spanish grammar]], ''[[Gram\u00e1tica de la lengua castellana]]'', in 1492. During the 16th-century [[Italian Renaissance]], the ''Questione della lingua'' was the discussion on the status and ideal form of the [[Italian language]], initiated by [[Dante]]'s ''[[de vulgari eloquentia]]'' ([[Pietro Bembo]], ''Prose della volgar lingua'' Venice 1525). The first grammar of [[Slovene language]] was written in 1583 by [[Adam Bohori\u010d]].\n\nGrammars of non-European languages began to be compiled for the purposes of [[evangelization]] and [[Bible translation]] from the 16th century onward, such as ''Grammatica o Arte de la Lengua General de los Indios de los Reynos del Per\u00fa'' (1560), and a [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] grammar by [[Fray Domingo de Santo Tom\u00e1s]].\n\nFrom the latter part of the 18th century, grammar came to be understood as a subfield of the emerging discipline of modern linguistics. The ''Deutsche Grammatik'' of the [[Jacob Grimm]] was first published in the 1810s. The ''Comparative Grammar'' of [[Franz Bopp]], the starting point of modern [[comparative linguistics]], came out in 1833.\n\n=={{anchor|Frameworks}} Theoretical frameworks==\n{{Further|Syntax#Theories}}\n[[File:Parse_tree_1.jpg|thumb|Simple constituency grammar [[parse tree]], whereby the sentence is divided into a [[noun phrase]] and a [[verb phrase]].]]\nFrameworks of grammar, which attempt to give a precise scientific theory of the syntax rules of grammar and their function, have been developed in [[theoretical linguistics]]. Most mainstream frameworks are based on the conception of an innate \"[[universal grammar]]\", an idea developed by [[Noam Chomsky]]. The most prominent theories are:\n{{Expand list|date=March 2018}}\n*[[Generative grammar]]: algorithmic constituency aka \"[[phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]]\" relation (Noam Chomsky 1950)\n**[[Transformational grammar]] (1960s)\n**[[Generative semantics]] (1970s)\n***[[Semantic Syntax]] (1990s)\n**[[Generalised phrase structure grammar]] (late 1970s)\n***[[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (1985)\n***[[Principles and parameters]] grammar ([[Government and binding theory]]) (1980s)\n**[[Lexical functional grammar]]\n**[[Categorial grammar]] ([[lambda calculus]])\n***[[Montague grammar]]\n**[[Minimalist program]]-based grammar (1993)\n*[[Dependency grammar]]: dependency relation ([[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] 1959)\n**[[Link grammar]]\n*[[Cognitive grammar]] / [[Cognitive linguistics]]\n**[[Construction grammar]]\n***[[Fluid Construction Grammar]]\n**[[Word grammar]]\n*[[Stochastic grammar]]: probabilistic\n**[[Operator Grammar]]\n*[[Functional theories of grammar|Functional grammar]]: usage-oriented (behaviorist)\n**[[Danish Functionalism]]\n**[[Systemic functional grammar]]\n**[[Role and reference grammar]]\n\n[[Parse tree]]s are commonly (but not always) used by such frameworks to depict their rules. There are various additional notation schemes for some grammars:\n*[[Constraint grammar]]\n*[[Tree-adjoining grammar]]\n*[[Affix grammar over a finite lattice]]\n*[[Lambda calculus]]\n*[[X-bar theory]]\n*[[Backus\u2013Naur form]]\n\n==Development of grammars==\n{{Main|Historical linguistics|History of English grammars}}\nGrammars evolve through usage and also due to separations of the human population. With the advent of written [[Knowledge representation|representations]], formal rules about language usage tend to appear also. [[Formal grammar]]s are [[codification (linguistics)|codifications]] of usage that are developed by repeated documentation over time, and by [[observation]] as well. As the rules become established and developed, the prescriptive concept of [[grammatical correctness]] can arise. This often creates a discrepancy between contemporary usage and that which has been accepted, over time, as being correct. Linguists tend to view prescriptive grammars as having little justification beyond their authors' aesthetic tastes, although style guides may give useful advice about ''standard language employment'', based on descriptions of usage in contemporary writings of the same language. Linguistic prescriptions also form part of the explanation for variation in speech, particularly variation in the speech of an individual speaker (an explanation, for example, for why some people say \"I didn't do nothing\", some say \"I didn't do anything\", and some say one or the other depending on social context).\n\nThe formal study of grammar is an important part of education for children from a young age through advanced [[learning]], though the rules taught in schools are not a \"grammar\" in the sense most [[linguistics|linguists]] use the term, particularly as they are often [[prescriptive]] rather than [[descriptive]].\n\n[[Constructed language]]s (also called ''planned languages'' or ''conlangs'') are more common in the modern day than they used to be, although still extremely uncommon compared to natural languages. Many have been designed to aid human communication (for example, naturalistic [[Interlingua]], schematic [[Esperanto]], and the highly logic-compatible [[artificial language]] [[Lojban]]). Each of these languages has its own grammar.\n\nSyntax refers to the linguistic structure above the word level (e.g. how sentences are formed)\u2014though without taking into account [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], which is the domain of phonology. Morphology, by contrast, refers to structure at and below the word level (e.g. how compound words are formed), but above the level of individual sounds, which, like intonation, are in the domain of phonology.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last1 = Gussenhoven\n | first1 = Carlos\n | last2 = Jacobs\n | first2 = Haike\n | title = Understanding Phonology\n | publisher = Hodder Arnold\n | year = 2005\n | location = London\n | edition = second\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=gHp_QgAACAAJ&dq=Understanding+Phonology\n | isbn = 978-0340807354\n}}</ref> No clear line can be drawn, however, between syntax and morphology. [[Analytic languages]] use syntax to convey information that is encoded via [[inflection]] in [[synthetic language]]s. In other words, word order is not significant and morphology is highly significant in a purely synthetic language, whereas morphology is not significant and syntax is highly significant in an analytic language. Chinese and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], for example, are highly analytic, and meaning is therefore very context-dependent. (Both do have some inflections, and have had more in the past; thus, they are becoming even less synthetic and more \"purely\" analytic over time.) [[Latin]], which is highly [[synthetic language|synthetic]], uses [[affix]]es and [[inflection]]s to convey the same information that Chinese does with syntax. Because Latin words are quite (though not completely) self-contained, an intelligible Latin [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] can be made from elements that are placed in a largely arbitrary order. Latin has a complex affixation and simple syntax, while Chinese has the opposite.\n\n==Education==\n[[Prescriptive]] grammar is taught in primary and secondary school. The term \"[[grammar school]]\" historically refers to a school (attached to a cathedral or monastery) teaching Latin grammar to future priests and monks. In its earliest form, \"grammar school\" referred to a school that taught students to read, scan, interpret, and declaim Greek and Latin poets (including Homer, Virgil, Euripides, and others). These should not be confused with the related, albeit distinct, modern British grammar schools.\n\nA [[standard language]] is a particular dialect of a language that is promoted above other dialects in writing, education, and broadly speaking in the public sphere; it contrasts with [[vernacular]] dialects, which may be the objects of study in [[descriptive grammar]] but which are rarely taught prescriptively. The standardized \"[[first language]]\" taught in primary education may be subject to [[language politics|political]] controversy, because it may sometimes establish a standard defining nationality or [[ethnicity]].\n\nRecently, efforts have begun to update [[Linguistics in Education|grammar instruction]] in primary and secondary education. The primary focus has been to prevent the use of outdated prescriptive rules in favour of more accurate descriptive ones and to change perceptions about relative \"correctness\" of standard forms in comparison to non-standard dialects.\n\nThe pre-eminence of [[Parisian French]] has reigned largely unchallenged throughout the history of modern French literature. Standard Italian is not based on the speech of the capital, Rome, but on the speech of [[Florence]] because of the influence Florentines had on early [[Italian literature]]. Similarly, standard Spanish is not based on the speech of [[Madrid]], but on that of educated speakers from more northerly areas like [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]] (e.g. see ''[[Gram\u00e1tica de la lengua castellana]]''). In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] the Spanish standard is based on the local dialects of [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Montevideo]] ([[Rioplatense Spanish]]). [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] has, for now, two official standards, respectively [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[European Portuguese]].\n\nThe [[Serbian language]] is divided in a similar way; [[Serbia]] and the [[Republika Srpska]] use their own separate standards. The existence of a third standard is a matter of controversy, some consider [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] as a separate language, and some think it is merely another variety of Serbian.\n\n[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] has two standards, ''[[Bokm\u00e5l]]'' and ''[[Nynorsk]]'', the choice between which is subject to [[Norwegian language struggle|controversy]]: Each Norwegian municipality can declare one of the two its official language, or it can remain \"language neutral\". Nynorsk is endorsed by a minority of 27 percent of the municipalities. The main language used in primary schools normally follows the official language of its municipality and is decided by referendum within the local school district. [[Standard German]] emerged from the standardized chancellery use of [[Early New High German language|High German]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Until about 1800, it was almost entirely a written language, but now it is so widely spoken that most of the former [[German dialect]]s are nearly extinct.\n\n[[Standard Chinese]] has official status as the standard spoken form of the Chinese language in the People's Republic of China (PRC), the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) and the [[Singapore|Republic of Singapore]]. Pronunciation of Standard Chinese is based on the local accent of [[Mandarin Chinese]] from Luanping, Chengde in Hebei Province near Beijing, while grammar and syntax are based on modern [[vernacular written Chinese]].\n[[Modern Standard Arabic]] is directly based on [[Classical Arabic]], the language of the [[Qur'an]]. The [[Hindustani language]] has two standards, [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]].\n\nIn the United States, the Society for the Promotion of Good Grammar designated 4 March as [[National Grammar Day]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalgrammarday.com/|title=National Grammar Day: Brought to you by Grammar Girl and the Society for the Promotion of Good Grammar}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[:Category:Grammars of specific languages]]\n* [[Ambiguous grammar]]\n* [[Government and binding]]\n* [[Grammeme]]\n* [[Harmonic Grammar]]\n* [[Higher order grammar]]\n* [[Linguistic typology]]\n* [[List of linguists]]\n* [[Paragrammatism]]\n* [[Usage]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{refbegin}}\n\n==References==\n* American Academic Press, The (ed.).

[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gigabyte Gigabyte - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]</ref> is a multiple of the unit [[byte]] for digital information. The [[SI prefix|prefix]] ''[[giga-|giga]]'' means 10<sup>9</sup> in the [[International System of Units]] (SI). Therefore, one gigabyte is {{gaps|1|000|000|000|bytes}}.  The unit symbol for the gigabyte is '''GB'''.\n\nThis definition is used in all contexts of science, engineering, business, and many areas of computing, including hard drive, solid state drive, and tape capacities, as well as data transmission speeds. However, the term is also used in some fields of computer science and information technology to denote {{gaps|1|073|741|824}} (1024<sup>3</sup> or 2<sup>30</sup>) bytes, particularly for sizes of [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. The use of ''gigabyte'' may thus be ambiguous. Hard disk capacities as described and marketed by drive manufacturers using the standard metric definition of the gigabyte, but when a 500-GB drive's capacity is displayed by, for example, [[Microsoft Windows]], it is reported as 465&nbsp;GB, using a binary interpretation.\n\nTo address this ambiguity, the [[International System of Quantities]] standardizes the [[binary prefix]]es which denote a series of integer powers of 1024. With these prefixes, a memory module that is labeled as having the size ''{{gaps|1|GB}}'' has one [[gibibyte]] ({{gaps|1|GiB}}) of storage capacity.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Laptop-hard-drive-exposed.jpg|thumb|right|This 2.5 inch [[Hard disk drive|hard drive]] can hold 500 GB (i.e., 500 billion bytes) of data.]]\nThe term ''gigabyte'' is commonly used to mean either 1000<sup>3</sup> bytes or 1024<sup>3</sup> bytes. The latter binary usage originated as compromise technical jargon for byte [[SI prefix|multiples]] that needed to be expressed in a power of 2, but lacked a convenient name. As 1024 (2<sup>10</sup>) is approximately 1000 (10<sup>3</sup>), roughly corresponding to SI multiples, it was used for binary multiples as well.\n\nIn 1998 the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) published standards for [[binary prefix]]es, requiring that the gigabyte strictly denote 1000<sup>3</sup> bytes and [[gibibyte]] denote 1024<sup>3</sup> bytes.  By the end of 2007, the IEC Standard had been adopted by the [[IEEE]], [[European Union|EU]], and [[NIST]], and in 2009 it was incorporated in the [[IEC 80000-13|International System of Quantities]]. Nevertheless, the term gigabyte continues to be widely used with the following two different meanings:\n\n===Base 10 (decimal)===\n* 1 GB = {{gaps|1|000|000|000}} bytes (= 1000<sup>3</sup> B = 10<sup>9</sup> B)\nBased on powers of 10, this definition uses the prefix giga- as defined in the [[International System of Units]] (SI). This is the recommended definition by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC).<ref name=\"NIST\">http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html Prefixes for binary multiples</ref> This definition is used in [[computer network|networking]] contexts and most [[storage media]], particularly [[hard drive]]s, [[Flash memory|flash]]-based storage,<ref name=\"sandisk_gigabyte\">[http://apac.sandisk.com/Products/Catalog(1349)-SanDisk_Extreme_Ducati_Edition_USB_Flash_Drive.aspx SanDisk USB Flash Drive] \"Note: 1 megabyte (MB) = 1 million bytes; 1 gigabyte (GB) = 1 billion bytes.\"</ref><ref name=\"kingston_gigabyte\">[http://www.kingston.com/us/usb/storage_chart Storage Chart] \"Megabyte (MB) = 1,000,000 bytes; 1 Gigabyte (GB) = 1,000,000,000 bytes; 1TB = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes\"</ref> and [[DVD]]s, and is also consistent with the other uses of the [[SI prefix]] in computing, such as [[Megahertz#Megahertz in computing|CPU clock speeds]] or [[FLOPS|measures of performance]]. The file manager of [[Mac OS X]] version 10.6 and later versions are a notable example of this usage in software, which report files sizes in decimal units.<ref name=\"Apple Inc\">{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2419 |title=How Mac OS X reports drive capacity |publisher=Apple Inc |date=2009-08-27 |accessdate=2009-10-16}}</ref>\n\n===Base 2 (binary)===\n* 1 GiB = {{gaps|1|073|741|824}} bytes (= 1024<sup>3</sup> B = 2<sup>30</sup> B).\nThe binary definition uses powers of the base 2, as does the architectural principle of [[Binary code|binary]] [[computer]]s.\nThis usage is widely promulgated by some [[operating system]]s, such as [[Microsoft Windows]] in reference to [[computer memory]] (e.g., [[Random-access memory|RAM]]). This definition is synonymous with the unambiguous unit [[gibibyte]].\n\n==Consumer confusion==\nSince the first disk drive, the [[IBM 350]], disk drive manufacturers expressed [[hard drive]] capacities using decimal prefixes. With the advent of gigabyte-range drive capacities, manufacturers based most consumer [[hard drive]] capacities in certain size classes expressed in decimal gigabytes, such as \"500 GB\". The exact capacity of a given drive model is usually slightly larger than the class designation. Practically all manufacturers of hard disk drives and flash-memory disk devices<ref name=\"sandisk_gigabyte\"/><ref name=\"kingston_gigabyte\"/> continue to define one gigabyte as {{gaps|1|000|000|000|bytes}}, which is displayed on the packaging. Some operating systems such as OS X<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201402|title=How OS X and iOS report storage capacity - Apple Support|website=support.apple.com|access-date=2016-06-29}}</ref> express hard drive capacity or file size using decimal multipliers, while others such as [[Microsoft Windows]] report size using binary multipliers. This discrepancy causes confusion, as a disk with an advertised capacity of, for example, {{nowrap|400 GB}}  (meaning {{gaps|400|000|000|000|bytes}}) might be reported by the operating system as {{nowrap|372 GB}}, meaning 372 GiB.\n\nThe [[JEDEC memory standards]] use '''IEEE 100''' nomenclature which quote the gigabyte as {{gaps|1|073|741|824|bytes}} (2<sup>30</sup> bytes).<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = JEDEC Solid State Technology Association\n  | title = Terms, Definitions, and Letter Symbols for Microcomputers, Microprocessors, and Memory Integrated Circuits\n  | journal = Jesd 100B.01\n  | date = December 2002\n  | url = http://www.jedec.org/download/search/JESD100B01.pdf\n  | postscript = <!--None-->\n  }}</ref>\n\nThe difference between units based on decimal and binary prefixes increases as a [[Semilog|semi-logarithmic]] (linear-log) function\u2014for example, the decimal kilobyte value is nearly 98% of the kibibyte, a [[megabyte]] is under 96% of a mebibyte, and a gigabyte is just over 93% of a gibibyte value. This means that a 300&nbsp;GB (279&nbsp;GiB) hard disk might be indicated variously as 300 GB, 279&nbsp;GB or 279 GiB, depending on the operating system. As storage sizes increase and larger units are used, these differences become even more pronounced.

It is thus convenient to use prefixes denoting powers of 1024, known as [[binary prefixes]], in describing them. For example, a memory capacity of {{gaps|1|073|741|824|bytes}} is conveniently expressed as 1&nbsp;[[gibibyte|GiB]] rather than as 1.074&nbsp;GB.

When observed visually, clusters appear to be collections of galaxies held together by mutual gravitational attraction. However, their velocities are too large for them to remain gravitationally bound by their mutual attractions, implying the presence of either an additional invisible mass component, or an additional attractive force besides gravity. X-ray studies have revealed the presence of large amounts of intergalactic gas known as the [[intracluster medium]]. This gas is very hot, between 10<sup>7</sup>K and 10<sup>8</sup>K, and hence emits X-rays in the form of [[bremsstrahlung]] and [[atomic spectral line|atomic line emission]].\n\n[[Image:ACO 3341.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Galaxy cluster ACO 3341 seen by [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]]'s [[Visible Multi Object Spectrograph|VIMOS]]]]\n\nThe total mass of the gas is greater than that of the galaxies by roughly a factor of two. However, this is still not enough mass to keep the galaxies in the cluster. Since this gas is in approximate [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] with the overall cluster gravitational field,  the total mass distribution can be determined. It turns out the total mass deduced from this measurement is approximately six times larger than the mass of the galaxies or the hot gas. The missing component is known as [[dark matter]] and its nature is unknown. In a typical cluster perhaps only 5% of the total mass is in the form of galaxies, maybe 10% in the form of hot X-ray emitting gas and the remainder is dark matter.

This strange effect is called [[gravitational lensing]].]]\n\nClusters of galaxies have been found in [[astronomical catalog|surveys]] by a number of observational techniques and have been studied in detail using many methods:\n* [[Visible-light astronomy|Optical]] or [[Infrared astronomy|infrared]]:  The individual galaxies of clusters can be studied through optical or infrared imaging and spectroscopy. Galaxy clusters are found by optical or infrared telescopes by searching for overdensities, and then confirmed by finding several galaxies at a similar [[redshift]]. Infrared searches are more useful for finding more distant (higher [[redshift]]) clusters.\n* [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]]:  The hot plasma emits X-rays that can be detected by [[X-ray]] [[telescope]]s. The cluster gas can be studied using both X-ray imaging and X-ray spectroscopy. Clusters are quite prominent in X-ray surveys and along with [[Active galactic nucleus|AGN]] are the brightest X-ray emitting extragalactic objects.\n* [[Radio astronomy|Radio]]:  A number of [[radio halo|diffuse structures]] emitting at radio frequencies have been found in clusters. Groups of radio sources (that may include [[radio halo|diffuse structures]] or AGN) have been used as tracers of cluster location. At high [[redshift]] imaging around individual radio sources (in this case AGN) has been used to detect proto-clusters (clusters in the process of forming).\n* [[Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect]]:  The hot electrons in the intracluster medium scatter radiation from the [[cosmic microwave background]] through inverse [[Compton scattering]]. This produces a \"shadow\" in the observed [[cosmic microwave background]] at some radio frequencies.\n* [[Gravitational lens]]ing:  Clusters of galaxies contain enough matter to distort the observed orientations of galaxies behind them. The observed distortions can be used to model the distribution of dark matter in the cluster.\n\n== Temperature and density ==\n[[File:Most remote mature cluster.tif|thumb|The Most Distant Mature Galaxy Cluster<ref>{{cite web|title=The Most Distant Mature Galaxy Cluster|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1108/|work=ESO Science Release|publisher=ESO|accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref> taken with ESO's [[Very Large Telescope]] in Chile and with NAOJ's [[Subaru Telescope]] in Hawaii]]\n\nClusters of galaxies are the most recent and most massive objects to have arisen in the hierarchical structure formation of the Universe and the study of clusters tells one about the way galaxies form and evolve. Clusters have two important properties: their masses are large enough to retain any energetic gas ejected from member galaxies and the thermal energy of the gas within the cluster is observable within the X-Ray bandpass. The observed state of gas within a cluster is determined by a combination of [[shock heating]] during accretion, radiative cooling, and thermal feedback triggered by that cooling. The [[density]], [[temperature]], and substructure of the intracluster X-Ray gas therefore represents the entire thermal history of cluster formation. To better understand this thermal history one needs to study the entropy of the gas because entropy is the quantity most directly changed by increasing or decreasing the thermal energy of intracluster gas.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAVS0GFTZlgC10|title=Galaxies |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |page=55}}</ref>\n\n== List of groups and clusters ==\n{{main|List of galaxy groups and clusters}}\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!

The governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] at the time of the rebellion of [[Vindex|Julius Vindex]] in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], he seized the throne following [[Nero|Nero's]] suicide.\n\nBorn into a wealthy family, Galba was a capable military officer during the first half of the first century AD. He retired during Nero's reign but was later granted the governorship of Hispania Tarraconensis. Taking advantage of the defeat of Vindex's rebellion and Nero's suicide, he became emperor with the support of the [[Praetorian Guard]].\n\nGalba was the oldest emperor to date when he became Emperor and his physical weakness and general apathy led to his being dominated by favorites. Unable to gain popularity with the people or maintain the support of the Praetorian Guard, Galba was killed by [[Otho]], who rebelled when Galba passed him over as his successor.\n\nHe was the first emperor of the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], and the last to be born in the first century BC.\n\n==Origins and family life==\nHe was born as '''Servius Sulpicius Galba''' near [[Terracina]], \"on the left as you go towards [[Fondi|Fundi]]\" in the words of [[Suetonius]].<ref>[{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=UrGdu3CwL2IC|page=248|text=on the left as you go towards Fundi}} Suetonius Tranquillus, The Lives Of The Caesars]</ref>\n\nThrough his paternal grandfather (\"more eminent for his learning than for his rank \u2014 for he did not advance beyond the grade of [[praetor]]\" and who \"published a voluminous and painstaking history\", and, according to Suetonius, predicted his rise to power),<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Galba*.html#4 Suetonius, 4]</ref> he was descended from [[Servius Sulpicius Galba (praetor)|Servius Sulpicius Galba]]. Galba's [[Gaius Sulpicius Galba (consul 5 BC)|father]] attained the consulship, and although he was short, [[hunchback]]ed and only an indifferent speaker, was an industrious pleader at the [[bar (law)|bar]].\n\nHis mother was [[Mummia Achaica]], the granddaughter of [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus (Capitolinus)|Lutatius Catulus]] (cos. 78 BC) and great-granddaughter of [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus]]. They only had one other child, an elder son called [[Gaius Sulpicius Galba|Gaius]] who left Rome after squandering the greater part of his estate, and committed suicide because Tiberius dishonored him by preventing him from taking part in the [[senatorial province|allotment of the provinces]] [[cursus honorum|in his year]]. His father married a second wife, [[Livia Ocellina]], a distant kinswoman of the empress [[Livia]].  She later adopted Galba, so he took her names, remaining '''Lucius Livius Ocella Sulpicius Galba''' until becoming emperor.\n\nHis was a noble family, and he was a man of great wealth, but was unconnected by birth and only very, very remotely by [[adoption]] with any of the first six Caesars. Despite this, in his early years he was regarded as a youth of remarkable abilities, and it is said that both [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]] and [[Tiberius]] prophesied his future eminence ([[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+6.20 vi. 20]; [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Galba*.html#4 Suet. Galba&nbsp;4]; Dio 57.19.4).\n\nHis wife, [[Aemilia Lepida]], however, was connected by the marriages of some of her relatives to some of the Julii-Claudii. They had two sons, probably Gaius and Servius (most likely Livius Ocella Galba), who died during their father's life.  The elder son was born circa 25 AD, and hardly anything is known about his life, as he died young. He was engaged to his step-sister Antonia Postuma, but they never wed, which leads modern historians to believe that he died during this time. Their engagement is dated to 48, and that is generally believed to be his time of death.\n\nThe date of birth of the younger son occurred later than 25 but before 30. This Galba outlived his older brother. He was a [[quaestor]] in 58, but he was never seen in politics after that. His time of death is generally believed to be around 60 AD. Galba Minor was never married and had no children.<ref>The following quote is NOT in Suetonius and has been removed to a footnote until the citation can be corrected and/or verified. ... Suetonius mentions that \"Galba Minor had discovered his father's affair with a male slave and threatened to tell his step-mother, which led to death of him.\"</ref>\n\nAdditionally, [[Suetonius]]'s description of Galba was that \"In sexual matters he was more inclined to males, and then none but the hard bodied and those past their prime\".<ref>Suetonius, ''Galba'', 22</ref> This seems to be the only case in Roman history where a named individual male is stated to prefer adult males.<ref>Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'', Oxford, 1992</ref>\n[[File:Servius Sulpicius Galba Emperor.jpg|thumb|Servius Sulpicius Galba]]\n\n=== Public service ===\nHe became [[Praetor]] in 20, and [[Roman consul|consul]] in 33; he earned a reputation in the provinces of [[Gaul]], [[Germania]], [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] and [[Hispania]] for his military capability, strictness and impartiality in judging disputes. On the death of [[Caligula]], he refused the invitation of his friends to make a bid for the empire, and loyally served [[Claudius]]. For the first half of [[Nero]]'s reign he lived in retirement, until 61, when the emperor bestowed on him the province of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]].\n\nIn the spring of 68, Galba was informed of Nero's intention to put him to death, and of the insurrection of [[Vindex|Julius Vindex]] in Gaul. He was at first inclined to follow the example of Vindex, but the defeat at Vesontio (Besan\u00e7on) and suicide<ref>Plutarch ''Galba 6.4''</ref> of the latter renewed Galba's hesitation. It was said that the [[courtier]] [[Calvia Crispinilla]] was behind his defection from Nero.<ref name=\"abit\">{{cite web |url=http://abitofhistory.net/html/rhw/body_files/c_body.htm |title=Calvia Crispinilla |publisher=A Bit of History |work=Women of History |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe news that [[Nymphidius Sabinus]], the [[Praetorian Guard|Praetorian]] [[Prefect]], had given him his favour revived Galba's spirits. Until now, he had only dared to call himself the [[Legatus|legate]] of the [[Roman Senate|senate]] and Roman people; after Nero's [[suicide]], he assumed the title of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', and marched straight for [[Rome]].\n\nFollowing Nero's death, Nymphidius Sabinus sought to seize power prior to the arrival of Galba, but he could not win the loyalty of the Praetorian guard and was killed. Upon Galba's approach to the city in October, he was met by soldiers presenting demands; Galba replied by killing many of them.\n\n==Emperor (June 68)==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}\n\n===Rule===\n[[File:Bronze Galba MBA Lyon.JPG|thumb|Galba - [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]]]]\nGalba's primary concern during his brief reign was restoring state finances, and to this end he undertook a number of unpopular measures, the most dangerous was his refusal to pay the praetorians the reward promised in his name. Galba scorned the notion that soldiers should be \"[[bribery|bribed]]\" for their loyalty. He was notoriously cruel throughout the Empire;{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} according to the historian [[Suetonius]], Galba levied massive taxes against areas that were slow to receive him as Emperor.<ref name=Suetonius />\n\nHe also sentenced many to death without trial, and rarely accepted requests for citizenship.<ref name=Suetonius /> He further disgusted the populace by his meanness and dislike of pomp and display. Aged 71 at the time he became emperor, he would be the oldest person to become emperor until [[Gordian I]] in 238. Advanced age destroyed his energy, and he was entirely in the hands of favourites.<ref name=Suetonius>{{cite book|last=Suetonious|title=The Twelve Caesars|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-045516-8|pages=242\u2013254}}</ref>\n\nThree of these \u2014 [[Titus Vinius]], who became Galba's colleague as [[Roman consul|consul]], [[Cornelius Laco]], the commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]], and Galba's [[freedman]] Icelus Marcianus \u2014 were said to virtually control the emperor.<ref name=\"Suetonius\"/> The three were called \"The Three [[Pedagogue]]s\" because of their influence on Galba. All this made the new emperor gravely unpopular.\n\nDuring the later period of his provincial administration, Galba was indolent and apathetic, but this was due either to a desire not to attract Nero's notice or to the growing infirmities of age. [[Tacitus]] says all pronounced him worthy of the empire, until he became emperor (\"''omnium consens\u016b c\u0101pax imperi\u012b nisi imper\u0101sset''\"). As Pharaoh of Egypt, Galba adopted the titulary ''Autokrator Servios Galbas'' (\u201cEmperor Servius Galba\u201d).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pharaoh.se/roman-emperor/Galba |title=Galba |work=The Royal Titulary of Ancient Egypt |access-date=March 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Mutiny on the frontier===\nOn 1 January 69, two legions in [[Germania Superior]] refused to swear loyalty to Galba. They toppled his statues, demanding that a new emperor be chosen. On the following day, the soldiers of [[Germania Inferior]] also rebelled and took the decision of who should be the next emperor into their own hands, proclaiming the governor of the province, [[Vitellius]], as Emperor.\n\nThis outbreak of revolt made Galba aware of his own unpopularity and of the general discontent. In order to check the rising storm, he adopted as his heir and successor [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Licinianus|L. Calpurnius Piso]]. The populace regarded the choice of successor as a sign of fear and the Praetorians were indignant, because the usual donative was not forthcoming.  Furthermore, [[M. Salvius Otho]], who was expecting to be adopted, was alienated by the choice of Piso.\n\n===Assassination (January 69)===\nWhile Otho had governed [[Lusitania]] and was one of Galba's earliest supporters, he was disappointed at the selection of Piso and entered into communication with the discontented Praetorians, who hailed him as their emperor on 15 January 69. Galba at once set out to meet the rebels, though he was so feeble that he had to be carried in a litter.

Robert was the fireman for Wylam Colliery pumping engine, earning a very low wage, so there was no money for schooling. At 17, Stephenson became an engineman at Water Row Pit in [[Newburn]] nearby. George realised the value of education and paid to study at night school to learn reading, writing and arithmetic \u2013 he was [[illiterate]] until the age of 18. \n\nIn 1801 he began work at Black Callerton Colliery south of [[Ponteland]] as a 'brakesman', controlling the winding gear at the pit. In 1802 he married Frances Henderson and moved to [[Willington Quay]], east of Newcastle. There he worked as a brakesman while they lived in one room of a cottage. George made shoes and mended clocks to supplement his income.\n\n[[File:Longbenton - Dial Cottage, Westmoor.jpg|thumb|Dial Cottage, [[West Moor]], Killingworth]]\nTheir first child [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]] was born in 1803, and in 1804 they moved to Dial Cottage at [[West Moor]], near [[Killingworth]] where George worked as a brakesman at Killingworth Pit. Their second child, a daughter was born in July 1805. She was named Frances after her mother. The child died after just three weeks and was buried in [[St Bartholomew's Church, Long Benton]] north of Newcastle.\n\nIn 1806 George's wife Frances died of consumption ([[tuberculosis]]). She was buried in the same churchyard as their daughter on the 16th May 1806, though sadly the location of the grave is lost.<ref >{{cite web |url=https://www.ice.org.uk/getattachment/c4025218-ae88-43ae-8dec-8d2be92cbe37/attachment.aspx   |title=Robert Stephenson, Engineer 1803\u20131859 |website=Northumbria Trail |publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers}}</ref>\n\nGeorge decided to find work in Scotland and left Robert with a local woman while he went to work in [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]]. After a few months he returned, probably because his father was blinded in a mining accident. He moved back into a cottage at West Moor and his unmarried sister Eleanor moved in to look after Robert. In 1811 the pumping engine at High Pit, Killingworth was not working properly and Stephenson offered to improve it.<ref name=\"Smiles, Lives of the Engineers, Stephenson, 43\" /> He did so with such success that he was promoted to enginewright for the collieries at Killingworth, responsible for maintaining and repairing all the colliery engines. He became an expert in steam-driven machinery.<ref name=\"Davies\" >{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Hunter |authorlink=Hunter Davies |year=1975 |title=George Stephenson |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |isbn=0-297-76934-0}}</ref>\n\n==The miner's safety lamp==\n{{Further information|Safety lamp}}\n[[File:Stephenson-safety-lamp.jpg|thumb|Stephenson's safety lamp shown with Davy's lamp on the left]]\nIn 1815, aware of the explosions often caused in mines by naked flames, Stephenson began to experiment with a [[safety lamp]] that would burn in a gaseous atmosphere without causing an explosion. At the same time, the eminent scientist and Cornishman [[Humphry Davy]] was also looking at the problem. Despite his lack of scientific knowledge, Stephenson, by trial and error, devised a lamp in which the air entered via tiny holes, through which the flames of the lamp could not pass. \n\nA month before Davy presented his design to the [[Royal Society]], Stephenson demonstrated his own lamp to two witnesses by taking it down Killingworth Colliery and holding it in front of a fissure from which [[firedamp]] was issuing. The two designs differed; Davy's lamp was surrounded by a screen of gauze, whereas Stephenson's prototype lamp had a perforated plate contained in a glass cylinder. For his invention Davy was awarded \u00a32,000, whilst Stephenson was accused of stealing the idea from Davy, because he was not seen as an adequate scientist who could have produced the lamp by any approved scientific method.\n\nStephenson, having come from the North-East, spoke with a broad Northumberland accent and not the 'Language of Parliament,' which made him seem lowly. Realizing this, he made a point of educating his son Robert in a private school, where he was taught to speak in [[Standard English]] with a [[Received Pronunciation]] accent. It was due to this, in their future dealings with Parliament, that it became clear that the authorities preferred Robert to his father.\n\nA local committee of enquiry gathered in support of Stephenson, exonerated him, proved he had been working separately to create the '[[Geordie]] Lamp', and awarded him \u00a31,000, but Davy and his supporters refused to accept their findings, and would not see how an uneducated man such as Stephenson could come up with the solution he had. In 1833 a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] committee found that Stephenson had equal claim to having invented the safety lamp. Davy went to his grave believing that Stephenson had stolen his idea. The Stephenson lamp was used almost exclusively in [[North East England]], whereas the Davy lamp was used everywhere else. The experience gave Stephenson a lifelong distrust of London-based, theoretical, scientific experts.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nIn his book ''George and Robert Stephenson'', the author [[L.T.C. Rolt]] relates that opinion varied about the two lamps' efficiency: that the Davy Lamp gave more light, but the Geordie Lamp was thought to be safer in a more gaseous atmosphere. He made reference to an incident at Oaks Colliery in Barnsley where both lamps were in use. Following a sudden strong influx of gas the tops of all the Davy Lamps became red hot (which had in the past caused an explosion, and in so doing risked another), whilst all the Geordie Lamps simply went out.\n\nThere is a theory that it was Stephenson who indirectly gave the name of [[Geordie]]s to the people of the North East of England. By this theory, the name of the Geordie Lamp attached to the North East pit men themselves. By 1866 any native of Newcastle upon Tyne could be called a Geordie.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1989|edition=2|chapter=Geordie}}</ref>\n\n==Early locomotives==\nCornishman [[Richard Trevithick]] is credited with the first realistic design for a steam locomotive in 1802. Later, he visited [[Tyneside]] and built an engine there for a mine-owner. Several local men were inspired by this, and designed their own engines.\n\n[[File:Killingworth-locomotive.jpg|thumb|Early Stephenson locomotive illustrated in [[Samuel Smiles]]' ''Lives of the Engineers'' (1862).<ref name=\"Smiles, Lives of the Engineers, Stephenson, 43\" /> <br>Described as an 1816 Killingworth Colliery locomotive, this is often claimed to be ''[[Bl\u00fccher (locomotive)|Bl\u00fccher]]'', but more closely resembles the slightly later [[Hetton colliery railway]] locomotives, and their 1852 replica ''[[Lyons, Hetton colliery railway|Lyons]]'', which was still operating at Smiles' time. <ref name=\"Smiles, Lives of the Engineers, Stephenson, 43\" />]]\nStephenson designed his first locomotive in 1814, a travelling engine designed for hauling coal on the Killingworth wagonway named ''[[Bl\u00fccher (locomotive)|Bl\u00fccher]]'' after the [[Prussia]]n general [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]] (It was suggested the name sprang from Bl\u00fccher's rapid march of his army in support of Wellington at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]).{{efn-lr|Recent scholarship holds that Stephenson's ''My Lord'' of 1814 pre-dated ''Bl\u00fccher''<ref name=\"Bailey, Stephenson\" />}} ''Bl\u00fccher'' was modelled on [[Matthew Murray]]\u2019s locomotive ''Willington'', which George studied at Kenton and Coxlodge colliery on Tyneside, and was constructed in the colliery workshop behind Stephenson's home, Dial Cottage, on Great Lime Road. The locomotive could haul 30 tons of coal up a hill at {{convert|4|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and was the first successful flanged-wheel adhesion locomotive: its traction depended on contact between its flanged wheels and the rail. \n\nAltogether, Stephenson is said to have produced 16 locomotives at Killingworth,<ref name=\"Davies\"/> although it has not proved possible to produce a convincing list of all 16. Of those identified, most were built for use at Killingworth or for the [[Hetton colliery railway]]. A six-wheeled locomotive was built for the [[Kilmarnock and Troon Railway]] in 1817 but was withdrawn from service because of damage to the cast-iron rails.<ref>Smiles (1857)</ref> Another locomotive was supplied to Scott's Pit railroad at [[Llansamlet]], near [[Swansea]], in 1819 but it too was withdrawn, apparently because it was under-boilered and again caused damage to the track.<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul |last=Reynolds |chapter=George Stephenson's 1819 Llansamlet locomotive | editor-first=M.J.T. |editor-last=Lewis |title=Early Railways 2: papers from the Second International Early Railways Conference |location=London |publisher=Newcomen Society |date=2003 |pages=165\u201376}}</ref>\n\n[[File:stephenson-rail-patent.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fishbelly rail]] with half-lap joint, patented by Stephenson 1816]]\nThe new engines were too heavy to run on wooden rails or plate-way, and iron edge rails were in their infancy, with [[cast iron]] exhibiting excessive brittleness. Together with [[William Losh]], Stephenson improved the design of cast-iron edge rails to reduce breakage; rails were briefly made by [[Losh, Wilson and Bell]] at their Walker ironworks. \n\nAccording to Rolt, Stephenson managed to solve the problem caused by the weight of the engine on the primitive rails. He experimented with a [[steam spring]] (to 'cushion' the weight using steam pressure acting on pistons to support the locomotive frame), but soon followed the practice of 'distributing' weight by using a number of wheels or bogies. For the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] Stephenson used [[wrought-iron]] malleable rails that he had found satisfactory, notwithstanding the financial loss he suffered by not using his own patented design.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nock|first=Oswald|authorlink=O.

He used a combination of gravity on downward inclines and locomotives for level and upward stretches. This, the first railway using no animal power, opened in 1822. This line used a gauge of {{railgauge|4ft8in|lk=on}} which Stephenson had used before at the [[Killingworth]] wagonway.<ref name=\"jones\">{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Robin|title=The Rocket Men|date=2013|publisher=Mortons Media Group|isbn=978-1909128255|page=33}}</ref>\n\nOther locomotives include:\n* 1817\u20131824 ''The Duke'' for the [[Kilmarnock and Troon Railway]]\n\n==Stockton and Darlington Railway==\n[[File:Stephenson-No.1-engine.jpg|thumb|The No. 1 engine, called ''Locomotion'', for the Stockton & Darlington Railway]]\nIn 1821, a parliamentary bill was passed to allow the building of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] (S&DR). The {{convert|25|mi|km|sing=on}} railway connected collieries near [[Bishop Auckland]] to the [[River Tees]] at [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]], passing through [[Darlington]] on the way. The original plan was to use horses to draw coal carts on metal rails, but after company director [[Edward Pease (1767-1858)|Edward Pease]] met Stephenson, he agreed to change the plans.\nStephenson surveyed the line in 1821, and assisted by his eighteen-year-old son Robert, construction began the same year.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n[[File:Stephenson-Experiment-.jpg|thumb|The Experiment \u2013 the first railway carriage]]\nA manufacturer was needed to provide the locomotives for the line. Pease and Stephenson had jointly established a company in Newcastle to manufacture locomotives. It was set up as [[Robert Stephenson and Company]], and George's son Robert was the managing director. A fourth partner was Michael Longridge of [[Bedlington Ironworks]].<ref name=\"Davies\"/> On an early trade card, Robert Stephenson & Co was described as \"Engineers, Millwrights & Machinists, Brass & Iron Founders\".<ref name=EllisandMorse>{{cite book |title=Steaming through Britain |first1=Chris |last1=Ellis |first2=Greg |last2=Morse |publisher=Conway |location=London |year=2010 |page=47 |isbn=978-1-84486-121-7}}</ref> In September 1825 the works at Forth Street, Newcastle completed the first locomotive for the railway: originally named ''Active'', it was renamed ''[[Locomotion No 1|Locomotion]]'' and was followed by ''Hope'', ''Diligence'' and ''Black Diamond''. The Stockton and Darlington Railway opened on 27 September 1825. Driven by Stephenson, ''Locomotion'' hauled an 80-ton load of coal and flour {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} in two hours, reaching a speed of {{convert|24|mph|km/h|abbr=off}} on one stretch. The first purpose-built passenger car, ''Experiment'', was attached and carried dignitaries on the opening journey. It was the first time passenger traffic had been run on a steam locomotive railway.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe rails used for the line were [[wrought-iron]], produced by [[John Birkinshaw]] at the [[Bedlington Ironworks]]. Wrought-iron rails could be produced in longer lengths than [[cast-iron]] and were less liable to crack under the weight of heavy locomotives. [[William Losh]] of Walker Ironworks thought he had an agreement with Stephenson to supply cast-iron rails, and Stephenson's decision caused a permanent rift between them. The gauge Stephenson chose for the line was {{convert|4|ft|8+1/2|in|mm}} which subsequently was adopted as the standard gauge for railways, not only in Britain, but throughout the world.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n==Liverpool and Manchester Railway==\n[[File:George Stephenson - National Railway Museum - 2005-10-15.jpg|thumb|Statue of George Stephenson at the [[National Railway Museum]], [[York]]]]\n[[File:First passenger railway 1830.jpg|left|thumb|First passenger railway, L&MR]]\nStephenson had ascertained by experiments at Killingworth that half the power of the locomotive was consumed by a gradient as little as 1 in 260.<ref>{{harvnb|Smiles|1862|p=244}}</ref> He concluded that railways should be kept as level as possible. He used this knowledge while working on the [[Bolton and Leigh Railway]], and the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (L&MR), executing a series of difficult cuttings, embankments and stone viaducts to level their routes. Defective surveying of the original route of the L&MR caused by hostility from some affected landowners meant Stephenson encountered difficulty during Parliamentary scrutiny of the original bill, especially under [[cross-examination]] by [[Edward Hall Alderson]]. The bill was rejected and a revised bill for a new alignment was submitted and passed in a subsequent session. The revised alignment presented the problem of crossing [[Chat Moss]], an apparently bottomless peat bog, which Stephenson overcame by unusual means, effectively floating the line across it.<ref name=\"Davies\"/> The method he used was similar to that used by [[John Metcalf (civil engineer)|John Metcalf]] who constructed many miles of road across marshes in the Pennines, laying a foundation of heather and branches, which became bound together by the weight of the passing coaches, with a layer of stones on top.\n\nAs the L&MR approached completion in 1829, its directors arranged a competition to decide who would build its locomotives, and the [[Rainhill Trials]] were run in October 1829. Entries could weigh no more than six tons and had to travel along the track for a total distance of {{convert|60|mi|km}}. Stephenson's entry was ''[[Stephenson's Rocket|Rocket]]'', and its performance in winning the contest made it famous. George's son Robert had been working in South America from 1824 to 1827 and returned to run the Forth Street Works while George was in [[Liverpool]] overseeing the construction of the line. Robert was responsible for the detailed design of ''Rocket'', although he was in constant postal communication with his father, who made many suggestions. One significant innovation, suggested by [[Henry Booth]], treasurer of the L&MR, was the use of a [[fire-tube boiler]], invented by French engineer [[Marc Seguin]] that gave improved heat exchange.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe [[Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opening ceremony of the L&MR]], on 15 September 1830, drew luminaries from the government and industry, including the Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. The day started with a procession of eight trains setting out from Liverpool. The parade was led by ''[[Northumbrian (locomotive)|Northumbrian]]'' driven by George Stephenson, and included ''Phoenix'' driven by his son Robert, ''North Star'' driven by his brother Robert and ''Rocket'' driven by assistant engineer [[Joseph Locke]]. The day was marred by the death of [[William Huskisson]], the Member of Parliament for Liverpool, who was struck by ''Rocket''. Stephenson evacuated the injured Huskisson to [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]] with a train, but he died from his injuries. Despite the tragedy, the railway was a resounding success. Stephenson became famous, and was offered the position of chief engineer for a wide variety of other railways.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n==Stephenson's skew arch bridge==\n[[File:Stephensonbridge1.jpg|left|thumb|Stephenson's bridge]]\n[[File:StephensonBridgeClose.jpg|right|thumb|A close-up of the technique]]\n\n1830 also saw the grand opening of the [[skew arch|skew bridge]] in Rainhill over the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The bridge was the first to cross any railway at an angle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rainhillparish.org.uk/history/railway_history.html |title=Railway History |website=Rainhill Parish Council }}</ref> It required the structure to be constructed as two flat planes (overlapping in this case by {{convert|6|ft|abbr=on}}) between which the stonework forms a parallelogram shape when viewed from above. It has the effect of flattening the arch and the solution is to lay the bricks forming the arch at an angle to the abutments (the piers on which the arches rest). The technique, which results in a spiral effect in the arch masonry, provides extra strength in the arch to compensate for the angled abutments.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Simmons, Jack  |author2=Biddle, Gordon | title=The Oxford companion to British railway history | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | pages=45\u201347 |isbn=0-19-211697-5}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is still in use at [[Rainhill railway station|Rainhill station]], and carries traffic on the [[A57 road|A57]] (Warrington Road). The bridge is a [[Listed building|listed structure]].\n\n==Life at Alton Grange==\n[[File:George Stephenson's House at Alton Grange.jpg|thumb|Stephenson's House at Alton Grange]]\n\nGeorge Stephenson moved to the parish of [[Alton, Leicestershire|Alton]] Grange (now part of Ravenstone) in Leicestershire in 1830 from Liverpool until 1838, originally to consult on the [[Leicester and Swannington Railway]], a line primarily proposed to take coal from the western coal fields of the county to Leicester. The promoters of the line Mr [[William Stenson]] and [[John Ellis (businessman)|Mr John Ellis]], had difficulties in raising the necessary capital as the majority of local wealth had been invested in canals. Realising the potential and need for the rail link Stephenson himself invested \u00a32,500 and raised the remaining capital through his network of connections in Liverpool. His son [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]] was made chief engineer with the first part of the line opening in 1832.\n\nDuring this same period the [[Snibston]] estate in Leicestershire came up for auction, it lay adjoining the proposed Swannington to Leicester route and was believed to contain valuable coal reserves. Stephenson realising the financial potential of the site, given its proximity to the proposed rail link and the fact that the manufacturing town of Leicester was then being supplied coal by canal from Derbyshire, bought the estate.\n\nEmploying a previously used method of mining in the midlands called tubbing to access the deep coal seams, his success could not have been greater. Stephenson\u2019s coal mine delivered the first rail cars of coal into Leicester dramatically reducing the price of coal and saving the city some \u00a340,000 per annum.\n\nStephenson remained at Alton Grange until 1838 before moving to [[Tapton House]] in Derbyshire. \n<ref>The Life of George & Robert Stephenson by Samuel Smile 1857</ref>\n\n==Later career==\n[[File:George Stephenson - Project Gutenberg etext 13103.jpg|thumb|George Stephenson]]\nThe next ten years were the busiest of Stephenson's life as he was besieged with requests from railway promoters. Many of the first American railroad builders came to Newcastle to learn from Stephenson and the first dozen or so locomotives utilised there were purchased from the Stephenson shops. Stephenson's conservative views on the capabilities of locomotives meant he favoured circuitous routes and civil engineering that were more costly than his successors thought necessary. For example, rather than the [[West Coast Main Line]] taking the direct route favoured by [[Joseph Locke]] over [[Lancaster and Carlisle Railway|Shap]] between [[City of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], Stephenson was in favour of a longer sea-level route via [[Ulverston]] and [[Whitehaven]]. Locke's route was built. \n\nStephenson tended to be more casual in estimating costs and paperwork in general. He worked with Joseph Locke on the [[Grand Junction Railway]] with half of the line allocated to each man. Stephenson's estimates and organising ability proved inferior to those of Locke and the board's dissatisfaction led to Stephenson's resignation causing a rift between them which was never healed.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nDespite Stephenson's loss of some routes to competitors due to his caution, he was offered more work than he could cope with, and was unable to accept all that was offered. He worked on the [[North Midland Railway|North Midland]] line from [[Derby]] to [[Leeds]], the [[York and North Midland Railway|York and North Midland]] line from Normanton to York, the [[Manchester and Leeds Railway|Manchester and Leeds]], the [[Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway|Birmingham and Derby]], the [[Sheffield and Rotherham Railway|Sheffield and Rotherham]] among many others.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nStephenson became a reassuring name rather than a cutting-edge technical adviser.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} He was the first president of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] on its formation in 1847. By this time he had settled into semi-retirement, supervising his mining interests in Derbyshire \u2013 tunnelling for the [[North Midland Railway]] revealed coal seams, and Stephenson put money into their exploitation.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nGeorge first courted Elizabeth (Betty) Hindmarsh, a farmer's daughter from Black Callerton, whom he met secretly in her orchard. Her father refused marriage because of Stephenson's lowly status as a miner.<ref>Samuel Smiles disputes this account, saying that Miss Hindmarsh's brother assured him that she didn't meet him before 1818 or 1819. See ''Lives of the Engineers'' 1862 vol 3. p116 (footnote).\n</ref> George next paid attention to Anne Henderson where he lodged with her family, but she rejected him and he transferred his attentions to her sister Frances (Fanny), who was nine years his senior. George and Fanny married at [[Newburn]] Church on 28 November 1802. They had two children Robert (1803) and Fanny (1805) but the latter died within months. George's wife died, probably of tuberculosis, the year after. While George was working in Scotland, Robert was brought up by a succession of neighbours and then by George's unmarried sister Eleanor (Nelly), who lived with them in Killingworth on George's return.\n\nOn 29 March 1820, George (now considerably wealthier) married Betty Hindmarsh at Newburn. The marriage seems to have been happy, but there were no children and Betty died on 3 August 1845.<Ref>http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Stephenson_G/stephensonGeorge8.asp</ref>\n\nOn 11 January 1848, at St John's Church in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, George married for the third time, to Ellen Gregory, another farmer's daughter originally from [[Bakewell]] in Derbyshire, who had been his housekeeper. Seven months after his wedding, George contracted [[pleurisy]] and died, aged 67, at noon on 12 August 1848<Ref>Derbyshire Courier - 19 August 1848</ref> at [[Tapton House]] in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He was buried at [[Holy Trinity Church, Chesterfield]], alongside his second wife.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nDescribed by Rolt as a generous man, Stephenson financially supported the wives and families of several who had died in his employment, due to accident or misadventure, some within his family, and some not. He was also a keen gardener throughout his life; during his last years at Tapton House, he built hothouses in the estate gardens, growing exotic fruits and vegetables in a 'not too friendly' rivalry with [[Joseph Paxton]]'s father, head gardener at nearby [[Chatsworth House]], twice beating the master of the craft.\n\n===Descendants===\nGeorge Stephenson had two children. His son [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]] was born on 16 October 1803. Robert married Frances Sanderson, daughter of a City of London professional John Sanderson, on 17 June 1829. Robert died in 1859 having no children. Robert Stephenson expanded on the work of his father and became a major railway engineer himself. Abroad, Robert was involved in the Alexandria\u2013Cairo railway that later connected with the [[Suez Canal]]. George Stephenson's daughter was born in 1805 but died within weeks of her birth. Descendants of the wider Stephenson family continue to live in Wylam (Stephenson's birthplace) today. Also relatives connected by his marriage live in Derbyshire. Some descendants later emigrated to Perth, Australia, with later generations remaining to this day.\n\n==Legacy==\nBritain led the world in the development of railways which acted as a stimulus for the [[Industrial Revolution]] by facilitating the transport of raw materials and manufactured goods. George Stephenson, with his work on the Stockton and Darlington Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, paved the way for the railway engineers who followed, such as his son Robert, his assistant [[Joseph Locke]] who carried out much work on his own account and [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. Stephenson was farsighted in realising that the individual lines being built would eventually be joined together, and would need to have the same gauge. The [[standard gauge]] used throughout much of the world is due to him. In 2002, Stephenson was named in the [[BBC]]'s television show and list of the ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]'' following a UK-wide vote, placing at no. 65.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-134458/100-great-Britons--A-complete-list.html |title=100 great Britons \u2013 A complete list |publisher=Daily Mail |date=21 August 2002 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Memorials and commemorations==\n\n[[File:George Stephenson - geograph.org.uk - 2315455.jpg|thumb|right|George Stephenson statue, Chesterfield March 2011]]\n[[George Stephenson's Birthplace]] is an 18th-century [[historic house museum]] in the village of [[Wylam]], and is operated by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

Also named after him and his son is [[George Stephenson High School]] in Killingworth, Stephenson Memorial Primary School in [[Howdon]], the [[Stephenson Railway Museum]] in [[North Shields]] and the [[Stephenson Locomotive Society]]. The Stephenson Centre, an SEBD Unit of Beaumont Hill School in Darlington, is named after him. His last home in Tapton, Chesterfield is now part of Chesterfield College and is called Tapton House Campus.\n\nAs a tribute to his life and works, a bronze statue of Stephenson was unveiled at [[Chesterfield railway station]] (in the town where Stephenson spent the last ten years of his life) on 28 October 2005, marking the completion of improvements to the station. At the event a full-size working replica of the ''[[Stephenson's Rocket|Rocket]]'' was on show, which then spent two days on public display at the Chesterfield Market Festival. A statue of him dressed in classical robes stands in Neville Street, Newcastle, facing the buildings that house the [[Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne]] and the [[North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers]], near [[Newcastle railway station]].

(1996), The Blackwell's Encyclopedia of Writing Systems, Oxford: Blackwells, p.174</ref> An individual grapheme may or may not carry meaning by itself, and may or may not correspond to a single [[phoneme]] of the spoken language. Graphemes include [[letter (alphabet)|alphabetic letters]], [[typographic ligature]]s, [[Chinese characters]], [[numerical digit]]s, [[punctuation]] marks, and other individual symbols. A grapheme can also be construed as a graphical sign that independently represents a portion of linguistic material.<ref>Altmann, G., & Fengxiang, F. (Eds.). (2008). ''Analyses of script : properties of characters and writing systems''. https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/34314  {{isbn|978-3-11-020710-1}}</ref>\n\nThe word ''grapheme'', coined in analogy with ''phoneme'', is derived {{ety|grc|''\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9'' (gr\u00e1ph\u014d)|write}}, and the suffix ''-eme'', by analogy with ''[[phoneme]]'' and other names of [[emic unit]]s. The study of graphemes is called [[graphemics]].\n\nThe concept of graphemes is an abstract one and similar to the notion in [[computing]] of a [[Character (computing)|character]]. By comparison, a specific shape that represents any particular grapheme in a specific [[typeface]] is called a [[glyph]]. For example, the grapheme corresponding to the abstract concept of \"the Arabic numeral one\" has two distinct glyphs ([[allograph]]s) in the fonts [[Times New Roman]] and [[Helvetica]].\n\n==Notation==\nGraphemes are often notated within angle brackets, as {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|B}}, etc.<ref name=\"Cambridge\">The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language, second edition, Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 196</ref> This is analogous to the slash notation (/a/, /b/) used for [[phoneme]]s, and the square bracket notation used for [[phonetics|phonetic]] transcriptions ([a], [b]).\n\n==Glyphs==\n{{main|Allography}}\nIn the same way that the [[surface form]]s of [[phoneme]]s are speech sounds or [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] (and different phones representing the same phoneme are called [[allophone]]s), the surface forms of graphemes are [[glyph]]s (sometimes \"graphs\"), namely concrete written representations of symbols, and different glyphs representing the same grapheme are called [[allography|allographs]]. Hence a grapheme can be regarded as an [[abstraction]] of a collection of glyphs that are all [[semantics|semantically]] equivalent.\n\nFor example, in written English (or other languages using the [[Latin alphabet]]), there are many different physical representations of the [[lowercase]] letter \"a\", such as a, \u0251, etc. But because the substitution of any of these for any other cannot change the meaning of a word, they are considered to be allographs of the same grapheme, which can be written {{angbr|a}}. Italic and bold face are also allographic.\n\nThere is some disagreement as to whether capital and lower-case letters are allographs or distinct graphemes. Capitals are generally found in certain triggering contexts which do not change the word: When used as a proper name, for example, or at the beginning of a sentence, or all caps in a newspaper headline. Some linguists consider [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] like the {{angbr|sh}} in ''ship'' to be distinct graphemes, but these are generally analyzed as sequences of graphemes. Non-stylistic [[Typographic ligature|Ligatures]], however, such as {{angbr|\u00e6}}, are distinct graphemes, as are various letters with distinctive [[diacritic]]s, such as {{angbr|\u00e7}}.\n\n==Types of graphemes==\n{{no references|section|date=December 2015}}\nThe principal types of phonographic graphemes are [[logograms]], which represent words or [[morpheme]]s (for example [[Chinese characters]], the [[ampersand]] \"&\" representing the word ''and'', [[Arabic numerals]]); [[syllabary|syllabic]] characters, representing [[syllable]]s (as in Japanese [[kana]]); and [[alphabet]]ic letters, corresponding roughly to [[phoneme]]s (see next section). For a full discussion of the different types, see {{section link|Writing system|Functional classification}}.\n\nNot all graphemes are phonographic (write sounds). There are additional graphemic components used in writing, such as [[punctuation mark]]s, [[mathematical symbol]]s, [[word divider]]s such as the space, and other [[:Category:Typographical symbols|typographic symbols]].  Ancient [[logogram|logographic scripts]] often used silent [[determinative]]s to disambiguate the meaning of a neighboring (non-silent) word.\n\n==Relationship between graphemes and phonemes==\n{{main|Phonemic orthography}}\nAs mentioned in the previous section, in languages that use [[alphabet]]ic writing systems, many of the graphemes stand in principle for the [[phoneme]]s (significant sounds) of the language. In practice, however, the [[orthography|orthographies]] of such languages entail at least a certain amount of deviation from the ideal of exact grapheme\u2013phoneme correspondence. A phoneme may be represented by a [[multigraph (orthography)|multigraph]] (sequence of more than one grapheme), as the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''sh'' represents a single sound in English (and sometimes a single grapheme may represent more than one phoneme, as with the Russian letter [[\u044f]]). Some graphemes may not represent any sound at all (like the ''b'' in English ''debt'' or the ''h'' in all Spanish words containing the said letter), and often the rules of correspondence between graphemes and phonemes become complex or irregular, particularly as a result of historical [[sound change]]s that are not necessarily reflected in spelling. \"Shallow\" orthographies such as those of standard [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] have relatively regular (though not always one-to-one) correspondence between graphemes and phonemes, while those of French and English have much less regular correspondence, and are known as [[orthographic depth|deep orthographies]].\n\nMultigraphs representing a single phoneme are normally treated as combinations of separate letters, not as graphemes in their own right. However, in some languages a multigraph may be treated as a single unit for the purposes of [[collation]]; for example, in a [[Czech language|Czech]] dictionary, the section for words that start with {{angbr|ch}} comes after that for {{angbr|h}}.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zeman|first=Dan|title=Czech Alphabet, Code Page, Keyboard, and Sorting Order|url=http://old-site.clsp.jhu.edu/ws98/projects/nlp/doc/czech_env/czech-info.html|accessdate=31 March 2012 |publisher=Old-site.clsp.jhu.edu }}</ref> For more examples, see {{section link|Alphabetical order|Language-specific conventions}}.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Character (computing)]]\n* [[Grapheme\u2013color synesthesia]]\n* Grapheme\u2013color [[ideasthesia]]\n* [[Sign (semiotics)]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Commons category}}\n{{writing systems}}\n{{List of writing systems}}\n\n[[Category:Graphemes| ]]\n[[Category:Typography]]", "sha1": "7v65muaey7xtfx1fvzmm494ut5f31js"}}, {"title": "Glass", "ns": "0", "id": "12581", "revision": {"id": "866168752", "parentid": "863843679", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T18:42:41Z", "contributor": {"username": "WavSlave", "id": "6405802"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Corrosion */ Subject-verb agreement correction", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the material}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{pp-protected|small=yes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2011}}\n{{Use American English|date=February 2015}}\n[[File:Soda-lime glass jar showing bubbles trapped within.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A jar made of soda-lime glass.

The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of glass are \"silicate glasses\" based on the chemical compound [[silicon dioxide|silica]] (silicon dioxide, or [[quartz]]), the primary constituent of [[sand]].  The term ''glass'', in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, which is familiar from use as window glass and in glass bottles. Of the many silica-based glasses that exist, ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a specific type called [[soda-lime glass]], composed of approximately 75% [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>), [[sodium oxide]] (Na<sub>2</sub>O) from [[sodium carbonate]] (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), [[Calcium oxide|calcium oxide (CaO), also called lime]], and several minor additives.\n\nMany applications of silicate glasses derive from their optical [[transparency and translucency|transparency]], giving rise to their primary use as window panes. Glass will [[Transmission coefficient#Optics|transmit]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] and [[refraction|refract]] light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make [[Lens (optics)|optical lenses]], [[prism]]s, fine glassware, and [[optical fiber]]s for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be coloured by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with [[vitreous enamel]]s. These qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of [[art objects]] and in particular, [[stained glass|stained glass windows]]. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has been traditionally used for vessels: [[bowl (vessel)|bowls]], [[vase]]s, [[bottle]]s, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for [[paperweight collecting|paperweights]], [[Marble (toy)|marbles]], and [[bead]]s. When extruded as [[glass fiber]] and matted as [[glass wool]] in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer [[plastic]], they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material [[fiberglass]]. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses.\n\nScientifically, the term \"glass\" is often defined in a broader sense, encompassing every solid that possesses a non-crystalline (that is, amorphous) structure at the atomic scale and that exhibits a [[glass transition]] when heated towards the liquid state. [[Porcelain]]s and many polymer [[thermoplastic]]s familiar from everyday use are glasses. These sorts of glasses can be made of quite different kinds of materials than silica: metallic [[alloy]]s, ionic melts, [[aqueous solution]]s, molecular liquids, and [[polymer]]s. For many applications, like [[glass bottles]] or [[eyewear]], polymer glasses ([[acrylic glass]], [[polycarbonate]] or [[polyethylene terephthalate]]) are a lighter alternative than traditional glass.\n\n==Silicate glass==\n\n===Ingredients===\n[[Silica]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>) is a common fundamental constituent of glass.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRKKCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA6&dq=silica+common+component+of+glass&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwie3Iv247vTAhUE82MKHYkkC7UQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&q=silica%20common%20component%20of%20glass&f=false|title=Forensic Polymer Engineering: Why Polymer Products Fail in Service|last=Lewis|first=Peter Rhys|date=2016-06-09|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|isbn=978-0-08-100728-0|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424095359/https://books.google.com/books?id=wRKKCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA6&dq=silica+common+component+of+glass&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwie3Iv247vTAhUE82MKHYkkC7UQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&q=silica%20common%20component%20of%20glass&f=false|archivedate=24 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In nature, [[vitrification]] of [[quartz]] occurs when [[lightning]] strikes [[sand]], forming hollow, [[dendrite (crystal)|branching rootlike]] structures called [[fulgurite]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cxEEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA363&dq=lightning+vitrifies+quartz+fulgurite&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNl--lveDTAhVKwlQKHYzLBpYQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=lightning%20vitrifies%20quartz%20fulgurite&f=false|title=Land, sea and sky; or, Wonders of life and nature, tr. from the Germ.

Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively [[Chemically inert|inert]] ones, such as [[Aluminium hydroxide|Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>]] over [[Aluminium oxide|Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]]. Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material.

Lead oxide also facilitates solubility of other metal oxides and is used in colored glass. The viscosity decrease of lead glass melt is very significant (roughly 100 times in comparison with soda glass); this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in [[vitreous enamel]]s and [[glass solder]]s. The high [[ionic radius]] of the Pb<sup>2+</sup> ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass (10<sup>8.5</sup> vs 10<sup>6.5</sup>&nbsp;\u03a9\u22c5cm, [[direct current|DC]] at 250&nbsp;\u00b0C).

This was initially termed \"splat cooling\" by doctoral student W. Klement at Caltech, who showed that cooling rates on the order of millions of degrees per second is sufficient to impede the formation of crystals, and the metallic atoms become \"locked into\" a glassy state. Amorphous metal wires have been produced by sputtering molten metal onto a spinning metal disk. More recently a number of alloys have been produced in layers with thickness exceeding 1 millimeter. These are known as bulk metallic glasses (BMG). [[Liquidmetal|Liquidmetal Technologies]] sell a number of zirconium-based BMGs.

This phase is the first phase, or \"primary phase\", to form in the Al-Fe-Si system during rapid cooling. Experimental evidence indicates that this phase forms by a ''first-order transition''. [[Transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM) images show that the q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles, which grow spherically with a uniform growth rate in all directions. The [[X-ray scattering techniques|diffraction pattern]] shows it to be an isotropic glassy phase. Yet there is a [[nucleation]] barrier, which implies an interfacial discontinuity (or internal surface) between the glass and the melt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metallurgy.nist.gov/techactv2004/TechnicalHighlights.html#glass|title=Metallurgy Division Publications|work=NIST Interagency Report 7127|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916063500/http://www.metallurgy.nist.gov/techactv2004/TechnicalHighlights.html#glass|archivedate=16 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Mendelev |first=M.

This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun.

Shorter molecules move faster and migrate farther than longer ones because shorter molecules migrate more easily through the pores of the gel. This phenomenon is called sieving.<ref>Sambrook J, Russel DW (2001). Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Cold Spring Harbor, NY.</ref>  Proteins are separated by charge in agarose because the pores of the gel are too large to sieve proteins.  Gel electrophoresis can also be used for separation of [[nanoparticle]]s.\n\nGel electrophoresis uses a gel as an anticonvective medium or sieving medium during electrophoresis, the movement of a charged particle in an electrical field. Gels suppress the thermal convection caused by application of the electric field, and can also act as a sieving medium, retarding the passage of molecules; gels can also simply serve to maintain the finished separation, so that a post electrophoresis stain can be applied.<ref name=Stryer>{{cite book|vauthors=Berg JM, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L |title = Biochemistry|edition = 5th|publisher = WH Freeman|year = 2002|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?&rid=stryer.section.438#455|isbn = 0-7167-4955-6}}</ref> DNA Gel electrophoresis is usually performed for analytical purposes, often after amplification of DNA via [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), but may be used as a preparative technique prior to use of other methods such as [[mass spectrometry]], [[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|RFLP]], PCR, [[cloning]], [[DNA sequencing]], or [[Southern blot]]ting for further characterization.\n\n==Physical basis==\n{{See also|electrophoresis}}\n[[Image:SDS-PAGE_Electrophoresis.png|thumb|500px|Overview of Gel Electrophoresis.]]\nIn simple terms, [[electrophoresis]] is a process which enables the sorting of molecules based on size. Using an electric field, molecules (such as DNA) can be made to move through a gel made of [[agarose]] or [[polyacrylamide]]. The electric field consists of a negative charge at one end which pushes the molecules through the gel, and a positive charge at the other end that pulls the molecules through the gel. The molecules being sorted are dispensed into a well in the gel material. The gel is placed in an electrophoresis chamber, which is then connected to a power source. When the electric current is applied, the larger molecules move more slowly through the gel while the smaller molecules move faster. The different sized molecules form distinct bands on the gel.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe term \"[[gel]]\" in this instance refers to the matrix used to contain, then separate the target molecules. In most cases, the gel is a [[crosslinked polymer]] whose composition and porosity is chosen based on the specific weight and composition of the target to be analyzed. When separating [[protein]]s or small [[nucleic acid]]s ([[DNA]], [[RNA]], or [[oligonucleotide]]s) the gel is usually composed of different concentrations of [[acrylamide]] and a [[cross-linker]], producing different sized mesh networks of polyacrylamide. When separating larger nucleic acids (greater than a few hundred [[base (chemistry)|bases]]), the preferred matrix is purified agarose. In both cases, the gel forms a solid, yet porous matrix. Acrylamide, in contrast to polyacrylamide, is a [[neurotoxin]] and must be handled using appropriate safety precautions to avoid poisoning. Agarose is composed of long unbranched chains of uncharged carbohydrate without cross links resulting in a gel with large pores allowing for the separation of macromolecules and [[affinity electrophoresis|macromolecular complexes]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nElectrophoresis refers to the [[electromotive force]] (EMF) that is used to move the molecules through the gel matrix. By placing the molecules in wells in the gel and applying an electric field, the molecules will move through the matrix at different rates, determined largely by their mass when the charge-to-mass ratio (Z) of all species is uniform. However, when charges are not all uniform then, the electrical field generated by the electrophoresis procedure will affect the species that have different charges and therefore will attract the species according to their charges being the opposite. Species that are positively charged will migrate towards the [[cathode]] which is negatively charged (because this is an [[Electrolytic cell|electrolytic]] rather than [[galvanic cell]]). If the species are negatively charged they will migrate towards the positively charged anode.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biochemical Techniques Theory and Practice|publisher=Waveland Press|year=1990|isbn= 0-88133-556-8|author1=Robyt, John F.  |author2=White, Bernard J.}}</ref>\n\nIf several samples have been loaded into adjacent wells in the gel, they will run parallel in individual lanes. Depending on the number of different molecules, each lane shows separation of the components from the original mixture as one or more distinct bands, one band per component. Incomplete separation of the components can lead to overlapping bands, or to indistinguishable smears representing multiple unresolved components.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Bands in different lanes that end up at the same distance from the top contain molecules that passed through the gel with the same speed, which usually means they are approximately the same size. There are [[molecular weight size marker]]s available that contain a mixture of molecules of known sizes. If such a marker was run on one lane in the gel parallel to the unknown samples, the bands observed can be compared to those of the unknown in order to determine their size. The distance a band travels is approximately inversely proportional to the logarithm of the size of the molecule.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThere are limits to electrophoretic techniques. Since passing current through a gel causes heating, gels may melt during electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is performed in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. There are also limitations in determining the molecular weight by SDS-PAGE, especially if you are trying to find the MW of an unknown protein. There are certain biological variables that are difficult or impossible to minimize and can affect the electrophoretic migration. Such factors include protein structure, post-translational modifications, and amino acid composition. For example, tropomyosin is an acidic protein that migrates abnormally on SDS-PAGE gels. This is because the acidic residues are repelled by the negatively charged SDS, leading to an inaccurate mass-to-charge ratio and migration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bio-rad.com/LifeScience/pdf/Bulletin_3133.pdf|title=Molecular Weight Determination by SDS-PAGE|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.\n\n==Types of gel==\n\nThe types of gel most typically used are agarose and polyacrylamide gels.  Each type of gel is well-suited to different types and sizes of analyte.  Polyacrylamide gels are usually used for proteins, and have very high resolving power for small fragments of DNA (5-500 bp).   Agarose gels on the other hand have lower resolving power for DNA but have greater range of separation, and are therefore used for DNA fragments of usually 50-20,000 bp in size, but resolution of over 6 Mb is possible with [[pulsed field gel electrophoresis]] (PFGE).<ref>{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author1=Tom Maniatis |author2=E.

They also differ in their casting methodology, as agarose sets thermally, while polyacrylamide forms in a chemical polymerization reaction.\n\n===Agarose===\n{{main|Agarose gel electrophoresis}}\nAgarose gels are made from the natural [[polysaccharide]] [[polymer]]s extracted from [[seaweed]].\nAgarose gels are easily cast and handled compared to other matrices, because the gel setting is a physical rather than chemical change. Samples are also easily recovered. After the experiment is finished, the resulting gel can be stored in a plastic bag in a refrigerator.\n\nAgarose gels do not have a uniform pore size, but are optimal for electrophoresis of proteins that are larger than 200 kDa.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Smisek | first1 = D.

The distance between DNA bands of different lengths is influenced by the percent agarose in the gel, with higher percentages requiring longer run times, sometimes days.  Instead high percentage agarose gels should be run with a [[Pulsed field gel electrophoresis|pulsed field electrophoresis]] (PFE), or [[field inversion electrophoresis]].\n\n\"Most agarose gels are made with between 0.7% (good separation or resolution of large 5\u201310kb DNA fragments) and 2% (good resolution for small 0.2\u20131kb fragments) agarose dissolved in electrophoresis buffer. Up to 3% can be used for separating very tiny fragments but a vertical polyacrylamide gel is more appropriate in this case. Low percentage gels are very weak and may break when you try to lift them. High percentage gels are often brittle and do not set evenly. 1% gels are common for many applications.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Agarose gel electrophoresis (basic method)|url=http://www.methodbook.net/dna/agarogel.html|work=Biological Protocols|accessdate=23 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Polyacrylamide===\n{{main|Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}}\n\nPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) is used for separating proteins ranging in size from 5 to 2,000 kDa due to the uniform pore size provided by the polyacrylamide gel. Pore size is controlled by modulating the concentrations of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide powder used in creating a gel. Care must be used when creating this type of gel, as acrylamide is a potent neurotoxin in its liquid and powdered forms.\n\nTraditional [[DNA sequencing]] techniques such as [[Dideoxy termination#Maxam-Gilbert sequencing|Maxam-Gilbert]] or [[Dideoxy termination#Chain termination method|Sanger]] methods used polyacrylamide gels to separate DNA fragments differing by a single base-pair in length so the sequence could be read. Most modern DNA separation methods now use agarose gels, except for particularly small DNA fragments. It is currently most often used in the field of [[immunology]] and protein analysis, often used to separate different proteins or [[isoforms]] of the same protein into separate bands. These can be transferred onto a [[nitrocellulose]] or [[PVDF]] membrane to be probed with antibodies and corresponding markers, such as in a [[western blot]].\n\nTypically [[resolving gels]] are made in 6%, 8%, 10%, 12% or 15%.  Stacking gel (5%) is poured on top of the resolving gel and a gel comb (which forms the wells and defines the lanes where proteins, sample buffer and ladders will be placed) is inserted.  The percentage chosen depends on the size of the protein that one wishes to identify or probe in the sample. The smaller the known weight, the higher the percentage that should be used. Changes on the buffer system of the gel can help to further resolve proteins of very small sizes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sch\u00e4gger|first=Hermann|title=Tricine\u2013SDS-PAGE|journal=Nature Protocols|year=2006|volume=1|issue=1|pages=16\u201322|doi=10.1038/nprot.2006.4|pmid=17406207}}</ref>\n\n===Starch===\n\nPartially [[hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] potato starch makes for another non-toxic medium for protein electrophoresis.

Thus, the mobility of each [[macromolecule]] depends only on its linear length and its mass-to-charge ratio.  Thus, the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary levels of [[biomolecular structure]] are disrupted, leaving only the primary structure to be analyzed.\n\nNucleic acids are often denatured by including [[urea]] in the buffer, while proteins are denatured using [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]], usually as part of the [[Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis|SDS-PAGE]] process.  For full denaturation of proteins, it is also necessary to reduce the covalent [[disulfide bond]]s that stabilize their [[tertiary structure|tertiary]] and [[quaternary structure]], a method called reducing PAGE. Reducing conditions are usually maintained by the addition of [[beta-mercaptoethanol]] or [[dithiothreitol]]. For general analysis of protein samples, reducing PAGE is the most common form of [[protein electrophoresis]].\n\nDenaturing conditions are necessary for proper estimation of molecular weight of RNA. RNA is able to form more intramolecular interactions than DNA which may result in change of its [[electrophoretic mobility]]. [[Urea]], [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] and [[glyoxal]] are the most often used denaturing agents to disrupt RNA structure.

This allows the physical size of the folded or assembled complex to affect the mobility, allowing for analysis of all four levels of the biomolecular structure.  For biological samples, detergents are used only to the extent that they are necessary to [[lysis|lyse]] [[lipid bilayer|lipid membranes]] in the [[cell (biology)|cell]]. Complexes remain\u2014for the most part\u2014associated and folded as they would be in the cell. One downside, however, is that complexes may not separate cleanly or predictably, as it is difficult to predict how the molecule's shape and size will affect its mobility. Addressing and solving this problem is a major aim of [[QPNC-PAGE|quantitative native PAGE]].\n\nUnlike denaturing methods, native gel electrophoresis does not use a charged [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] agent. The molecules being separated (usually [[proteins]] or [[nucleic acids]]) therefore differ not only in [[molecular mass]] and intrinsic charge, but also the cross-sectional area, and thus experience different electrophoretic forces dependent on the shape of the overall structure. For proteins, since they remain in the native state they may be visualised not only by general protein staining reagents but also by specific enzyme-linked staining.\n\nA specific experiment example of an application of native gel electrophoresis is to check for enzymatic activity to verify the presence of the enzyme in the sample during protein purification. For example, for the protein alkaline phosphatase, the staining solution is a mixture of 4-chloro-2-2methylbenzenediazonium salt with 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2\u2019-4\u2019-dimethyl aniline in Tris buffer. This stain is commercially sold as kit for staining gels. If the protein is present, the mechanism of the reaction takes place in the following order: it starts with the de-phosphorylation of 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2\u2019-4\u2019-dimethyl aniline by alkaline phosphatase (water is needed for the reaction). The phosphate group is released and replaced by an alcohol group from water. The electrophile 4- chloro-2-2 methylbenzenediazonium (Fast Red TR Diazonium salt) displaces the alcohol group forming the final product Red Azo dye. As its name implies, this is the final visible-red product of the reaction. In undergraduate academic experimentation of protein purification, the gel is usually ran next to commercial purified samples in order to visualize the results and make confusions of whether or not purification was successful.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Fundamental Approaches to Biochemistry and Biotechnology|vauthors = Ninfa AJ, Ballou DP, |publisher=Bethesda, Md: Fitzgerald Science Press|year=1998|isbn= 9781891786006|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[Native state|Native]] gel electrophoresis is typically used in [[proteomics]] and [[metallome|metallomics]]. However, native PAGE is also used to scan genes (DNA) for unknown mutations as in [[Single-strand conformation polymorphism]].\n\n==Buffers==\nBuffers in gel electrophoresis are used to provide ions that carry a current and to maintain the pH at a relatively constant value.\nThese buffers have plenty of ions in them, which is necessary for the passage of electricity through them. Something like distilled water or benzene contains few ions, which is not ideal for the use in electrophoresis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=fundamental laboratory approaches for biochemistry and biotechnology|last=Ninfa|first=Alexander J.|last2=Ballou|first2=David P.|last3=Benore|first3=Marilee|publisher=Wiley|year=2009|isbn=0470087668|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=161}}</ref> There are a number of buffers used for electrophoresis. The most common being, for nucleic acids [[TAE buffer|Tris/Acetate/EDTA]] (TAE), [[TBE buffer|Tris/Borate/EDTA]] (TBE). Many other buffers have been proposed, e.g. [[LB buffer|lithium borate]], which is almost never used, based on Pubmed citations (LB), iso electric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat)  matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Borate is problematic; Borate can polymerize, or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity but provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM Lithium borate).<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf | pmid = 15351274 | doi=10.1016/j.ab.2004.05.054 | volume=333 | issue=1 | title=History and principles of conductive media for standard DNA electrophoresis |date=October 2004 | journal=Anal. Biochem. | pages=1\u201313 |vauthors=Brody JR, Kern SE }}</ref>\n\nMost SDS-PAGE protein separations are performed using a [[Gel electrophoresis of proteins#Buffer systems|\"discontinuous\" (or DISC) buffer system]] that significantly enhances the sharpness of the bands within the gel. During electrophoresis in a discontinuous gel system, an ion gradient is formed in the early stage of electrophoresis that causes all of the proteins to focus into a single sharp band in a process called [[isotachophoresis]]. Separation of the proteins by size is achieved in the lower, \"resolving\" region of the gel. The resolving gel typically has a much smaller pore size, which leads to a sieving effect that now determines the electrophoretic mobility of the proteins.\n\n==Visualization==\n{{Further|Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids#Visualization|Gel electrophoresis of proteins#Visualization}}\n\nAfter the electrophoresis is complete, the molecules in the gel can be [[staining (biology)|stained]] to make them visible. DNA may be visualized using [[ethidium bromide]] which, when intercalated into DNA, [[fluorescence|fluoresce]] under [[ultraviolet]] light, while protein may be visualised using [[silver stain]] or [[Coomassie Brilliant Blue]] dye. Other methods may also be used to visualize the separation of the mixture's components on the gel. If the molecules to be separated contain [[radioactivity]], for example in a [[DNA sequencing]] gel, an [[isotopic tracer|autoradiogram]] can be recorded of the gel.  [[Photograph]]s can be taken of gels, often using a [[Gel Doc]] system.\n\n==Downstream processing==\n\nAfter separation, an additional separation method may then be used, such as [[isoelectric focusing]] or [[SDS-PAGE]]. The gel will then be physically cut, and the protein complexes extracted from each portion separately. Each extract may then be analysed, such as by [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] or [[de novo peptide sequencing]] after [[in-gel digestion]]. This can provide a great deal of information about the identities of the proteins in a complex.\n\n==Applications==\n*Estimation of the size of DNA molecules following restriction enzyme digestion, e.g. in [[restriction enzyme|restriction mapping]] of cloned DNA.\n*Analysis of [[PCR]] products, e.g. in molecular [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|genetic diagnosis]] or [[genetic fingerprinting]]\n*Separation of restricted genomic DNA prior to [[Southern blot|Southern transfer]], or of RNA prior to [[Northern Blot|Northern transfer]].\n\nGel electrophoresis is used in [[Forensic chemistry|forensics]], [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], [[microbiology]] and [[biochemistry]]. The results can be analyzed quantitatively by visualizing the gel with UV light and a gel imaging device. The image is recorded with a computer operated camera, and the intensity of the band or spot of interest is measured and compared against standard or markers loaded on the same gel. The measurement and analysis are mostly done with specialized software.\n\nDepending on the type of analysis being performed, other techniques are often implemented in conjunction with the results of gel electrophoresis, providing a wide range of field-specific applications.\n\n===Nucleic acids===\n{{Main|Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids}}\n\n[[File:Pcr gel.png|thumb|An agarose gel of a [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] product compared to a DNA ladder.]]\n\nIn the case of nucleic acids, the direction of migration, from negative to positive electrodes, is due to the naturally occurring negative charge carried by their [[sugar]]-[[phosphate]] backbone.<ref name=Lodish>{{cite book|author = Lodish H|title = Molecular Cell Biology|edition = 5th|publisher = WH Freeman: New York, NY|year = 2004|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?&rid=mcb.section.1637#1648|isbn = 978-0-7167-4366-8|author2 = Berk A|author3 = Matsudaira P}}</ref>\n\nDouble-stranded DNA fragments naturally behave as long rods, so their migration through the gel is relative to their size or, for cyclic fragments, their [[radius of gyration]]. Circular DNA such as [[plasmid]]s, however, may show multiple bands, the speed of migration may depend on whether it is relaxed or supercoiled.  Single-stranded DNA or RNA tend to fold up into molecules with complex shapes and migrate through the gel in a complicated manner based on their tertiary structure. Therefore, agents that disrupt the [[hydrogen bond]]s, such as [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[formamide]], are used to denature the nucleic acids and cause them to behave as long rods again.<ref>Troubleshooting DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. Focus 19:3 p.66 (1997).</ref>\n\nGel electrophoresis of large [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] is usually done by agarose gel electrophoresis. See the \"[[Chain termination method]]\" page for an example of a polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gel. Characterization through ligand interaction of nucleic acids or fragments may be performed by mobility shift [[affinity electrophoresis]].\n\nElectrophoresis of RNA samples can be used to check for genomic DNA contamination and also for RNA degradation. RNA from eukaryotic organisms shows distinct bands of 28s and 18s rRNA, the 28s band being approximately twice as intense as the 18s band. Degraded RNA has less sharply defined bands, has a smeared appearance, and intensity ratio is less than 2:1.\n\n===Proteins===\n{{Main|Gel electrophoresis of proteins}}\n\n[[File:SDSPAGE.png|thumb|right|'''SDS-PAGE [[autoradiography]]''' \u2013 The indicated proteins are present in different concentrations in the two samples.]]\n[[Protein]]s, unlike nucleic acids, can have varying charges and complex shapes, therefore they may not migrate into the polyacrylamide gel at similar rates, or at all, when placing a negative to positive EMF on the sample. Proteins therefore, are usually [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] in the presence of a [[detergent]] such as [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS) that coats the proteins with a negative charge.<ref name=Stryer /> Generally, the amount of SDS bound is relative to the size of the protein (usually 1.4g SDS per gram of protein), so that the resulting denatured proteins have an overall negative charge, and all the proteins have a similar charge-to-mass ratio. Since denatured proteins act like long rods instead of having a complex tertiary shape, the rate at which the resulting SDS coated proteins migrate in the gel is relative only to its size and not its charge or shape.<ref name=Stryer />\n\n[[Protein]]s are usually analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ([[SDS-PAGE]]), by [[Native Gel Electrophoresis|native gel electrophoresis]], by preparative gel electrophoresis ([[QPNC-PAGE]]), or by [[2-D electrophoresis]].\n\nCharacterization through ligand interaction may be performed by [[electroblotting]] or by [[affinity electrophoresis]] in agarose or by [[capillary electrophoresis]] as for estimation of [[binding constant]]s and determination of structural features like [[glycan]] content through [[lectin]] binding.\n\n==History==\n*1930s \u2013 first reports of the use of [[sucrose]] for gel electrophoresis\n*1955 \u2013 introduction of [[starch]] gels, mediocre separation (Smithies)<ref name=\"smithies\"/>\n*1959 \u2013 introduction of acrylamide gels; disc electrophoresis (Ornstein and Davis); accurate control of parameters such as pore size and stability; and (Raymond and Weintraub)\n*1966 \u2013 first use of [[agar]] gels<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Virology |year=1966 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=234\u20139 |title=Electrophoretic separation of polyoma virus DNA from host cell DNA |author=Thorne HV |pmid= 4287545 |doi=10.1016/0042-6822(66)90029-8}}</ref>\n*1969 \u2013 introduction of [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] agents especially [[Sodium dodecyl sulfate|SDS]] separation of [[protein]] subunit (Weber and Osborn)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=K|last2=Osborn|first2=M|title=The reliability of molecular weight determinations by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=244|issue=16|pages=4406\u201312|year=1969|pmid=5806584}}</ref>\n*1970 \u2013 Laemmli separated 28 components of [[T4 phage]] using a stacking gel and SDS\n*1972 \u2013 agarose gels with ethidium bromide stain<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Biochim Biophys Acta |year=1972 |volume=269 |issue=2 |pages=192\u2013200 |title=The gel electrophoresis of DNA |vauthors=Aaij C, Borst P |pmid=5063906 |doi=10.1016/0005-2787(72)90426-1}}</ref>\n*1975 \u2013 2-dimensional gels (O\u2019Farrell); [[isoelectric focusing]] then SDS gel electrophoresis\n*1977 \u2013 [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] gels\n*1983 \u2013 [[pulsed field gel electrophoresis]] enables separation of large DNA molecules\n*1983 \u2013 introduction of [[capillary electrophoresis]]\n*2004 \u2013 standardized time of [[polymerization]] of acrylamide gels enables clean and predictable separation of native proteins (Kastenholz)<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Analytical Letters |year=2004 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=657\u2013665 |title=Preparative native continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PNC\u2010PAGE): an efficient method for isolating cadmium cofactors in biological systems |author=Kastenholz B |pmid= |doi=10.1081/AL-120029742}}</ref>\n\nA 1959 book on electrophoresis by Milan Bier cites references from the 1800s.<ref>{{cite book|author = Milan Bier|title = Electrophoresis.

He holds [[England national football team|England]]'s record for goals in [[FIFA World Cup]] finals, with 10 scored. Lineker's media career began with the [[BBC]], where he has presented the flagship football programme ''[[Match of the Day]]'' since the late 1990s. He has also worked for [[Al Jazeera Sports]], [[Eredivisie Live]], [[NBC Sports Network]] and currently hosts [[BT Sport]]'s coverage of the [[UEFA Champions League]].\n\nLineker began his football career at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 1978, and finished as the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]'s joint top goalscorer in 1984\u201385. He then moved to League Champions [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] where he developed as a clinical finisher, scoring 30 goals in 41 games. His first team honours came at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], where he won the [[Copa del Rey]] in 1988 and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1989. He returned to England in 1989, joining [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and over three seasons he scored 67 goals in 105 games and won the [[FA Cup]]. Lineker's final club was [[Nagoya Grampus|Nagoya Grampus Eight]] and he retired in 1994 after two seasons at the Japanese side.\n\nLineker made his England debut in 1984, earning 80 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scoring 48 goals over an eight-year international career, and is England's third highest scorer, behind [[Bobby Charlton]] and [[Wayne Rooney]]. His international goals-to-games ratio remains one of the best for the country and he is regarded as one of the all-time best English [[Forward (association football)#Striker|strikers]]. He was top scorer in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] and received the [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]], the only time an Englishman had done so until [[Harry Kane]] in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].

He then joined the youth academy at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 1976.<ref name=\"indep\" />\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Leicester City===\nLineker began his career at his home town club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] after leaving school in 1977, turning professional in the [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]] season and making his senior debut on New Year's Day 1979 in a 2\u20130 win over [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] at [[Filbert Street]]. He earned a Second Division title medal a year later with 19 appearances, but played just nine league games in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]] as Leicester went straight back down.\n\nHowever, he became a regular player in [[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]], scoring 19 goals in all competitions that season. Although Leicester missed out on promotion, they reached the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]], and clinched promotion a year later as Lineker scored 26 times in the Second Division. In [[1983\u201384 in English football|1983\u201384]], he enjoyed regular First Division action for the first time and was the division's second highest scorer with 22 goals, although Leicester failed to finish anywhere near the top of the league. He was the First Division's joint top scorer in [[1984\u201385 in English football|1984\u201385]] with 24 goals, and was enjoying a prolific partnership with [[Alan Smith (footballer born 1962)|Alan Smith]]. However, by this stage, he was attracting the attention of bigger clubs, and a move from [[Filbert Street]] was looking certain.\n\n===Everton===\nIn the 1985 close season, defending league champions [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] signed Lineker for \u00a3800,000; he scored 40 goals in 57 games for his new team in the [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386]] season. He was again the First Division's leading goal scorer, this time with 30 goals (including three hat-tricks), and helped Everton finish second in the league. While at Everton, they reached the [[FA Cup]] final for the third consecutive year but lost 3\u20131 to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], despite Lineker giving them an early lead when he outpaced [[Alan Hansen]] to score. Liverpool had also pipped Everton to the title by just two points.\n\"I was only on Merseyside a short time, nine or 10 months in total really, but it was still a happy time personally, while professionally it was one of the most successful periods of my career,\" he says.\n\"I still have an affinity towards Everton.\"\n\nLineker scored three [[hat-tricks]] for Everton; at home to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in a 4\u20131 league win on 31 August 1985, at home to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in a 4\u20130 home win on 11 February 1986, and then in the penultimate league game of the season on 3 May 1986, when they kept their title hopes alive with a 6\u20131 home win over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. On his final league appearance, he scored twice in a 3\u20131 home win over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] whose own title hopes had just disappeared.

These cargo proteins are modified and destined for secretion via [[exocytosis]] or for use in the cell. \nIn this respect, the Golgi can be thought of as similar to a post office: it packages and labels items which it then sends to different parts of the cell or to the [[extracellular space]]. The Golgi apparatus is also involved in [[lipid]] transport and [[lysosome]] formation.<ref name=\"Campbell\">{{cite book | first = Neil A | last = Campbell| title = Biology | edition = 4| publisher = Benjamin/Cummings | location = Menlo Park, CA| year = 1996 | pages = 122, 123| isbn = 0-8053-1957-3}}</ref>\n\nThe structure and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked. Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face.<ref name=\"Alberts\"/><ref name=\"pmid23881164\"/> Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored.

Protein modifications may form a [[Signal peptide|signal sequence]] that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a [[mannose-6-phosphate]] label to proteins destined for [[lysosome]]s.

This area of the Golgi is the point at which proteins are sorted and shipped to their intended destinations by their placement into one of at least three different types of vesicles, depending upon the [[signal peptide|signal sequence]] they carry.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Types \n! Description\n! Example\n|-\n! Exocytotic vesicles ''(constitutive)''\n| Vesicle contains proteins destined for [[extracellular]] release.

Secretory vesicles ''(regulated)''\n| Vesicles contain proteins destined for extracellular release. After packaging, the vesicles bud off and are stored in the cell until a signal is given for their release. When the appropriate signal is received they move toward the membrane and fuse to release their contents. This process is known as ''[[Secretory pathway|regulated secretion]]''.\n| [[Neurotransmitter]] release from [[neuron]]s\n|-\n! Lysosomal vesicles\n| Vesicles contain proteins and ribosomes destined for the [[lysosome]], a degradative [[organelle]] containing many acid [[hydrolase]]s, or to lysosome-like storage organelles.

Each compartment has a unique collection of [[enzyme]]s that work to modify [[protein]] cargo. Proteins are delivered from the ER to the ''cis'' face using [[COPII]]-coated [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]s. Cargo then progress toward the ''trans'' face in [[COPI]]-coated vesicles. This model proposes that COPI vesicles move in two directions: [[Axoplasmic transport#Anterograde transport|anterograde]] vesicles carry [[secretory protein]]s, while [[Axoplasmic transport#Retrograde transport|retrograde]] vesicles recycle Golgi-specific trafficking proteins.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Glick BS, Luini A | title = Models for Golgi traffic: a critical assessment. | journal = Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = a005215 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21875986 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a005215 | pmc=3220355}}</ref>\n** '''Strengths:''' The model explains observations of compartments, polarized distribution of enzymes, and waves of moving vesicles. It also attempts to explain how Golgi-specific enzymes are recycled.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n** '''Weaknesses:''' Since the amount of COPI vesicles varies drastically among types of cells, this model cannot easily explain high trafficking activity within the Golgi for both small and large cargoes. Additionally, there is no convincing evidence that COPI vesicles move in both the anterograde and retrograde directions.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n* This model was widely accepted from the early 1980s until the late 1990s.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n\n===Model 2: Cisternal progression/maturation===\n* In this model, the fusion of COPII vesicles from the ER begins the formation of the first ''cis''-[[cisterna]] of the Golgi stack, which progresses later to become mature TGN cisternae. Once matured, the TGN cisternae dissolve to become secretory vesicles. While this progression occurs, COPI vesicles continually recycle Golgi-specific proteins by delivery from older to younger cisternae. Different recycling patterns may account for the differing biochemistry throughout the Golgi stack. Thus, the compartments within the Golgi are seen as discrete kinetic stages of the maturing Golgi apparatus.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n** '''Strengths:''' The model addresses the existence of Golgi compartments, as well as differing biochemistry within the cisternae, transport of large proteins, transient formation and disintegration of the cisternae, and retrograde mobility of native Golgi proteins, and it can account for the variability seen in the structures of the Golgi.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n** '''Weaknesses:''' This model cannot easily explain the observation of fused Golgi networks, tubular connections among cisternae, and differing kinetics of secretory cargo exit.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n\n===Model 3: Cisternal progression/maturation with heterotypic tubular transport===\n* This model is an extension of the cisternal progression/maturation model. It incorporates the existence of tubular connections among the cisternae that form the Golgi ribbon, in which cisternae within a stack are linked. This model posits that the tubules are important for bidirectional traffic in the ER-Golgi system: they allow for fast anterograde traffic of small cargo and/or the retrograde traffic of native Golgi proteins.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n** '''Strengths:''' This model encompasses the strengths of the cisternal progression/maturation model that also explains rapid trafficking of cargo, and how native Golgi proteins can recycle independently of COPI vesicles.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n** '''Weaknesses:''' This model cannot explain the transport kinetics of large protein cargo, such as [[collagen]]. Additionally, tubular connections are not prevalent in plant cells. The roles that these connections have can be attributed to a cell-specific specialization rather than a universal trait. If the membranes are continuous, that suggests the existence of mechanisms that preserve the unique biochemical gradients observed throughout the Golgi apparatus.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n\n===Model 4: Rapid partitioning in a mixed Golgi===\n* This rapid partitioning model is the most drastic alteration of the traditional vesicular trafficking point of view. Proponents of this model hypothesize that the Golgi works as a single unit, containing domains that function separately in the processing and export of protein cargo. Cargo from the ER move between these two domains, and randomly exit from any level of the Golgi to their final location. This model is supported by the observation that cargo exits the Golgi in a pattern best described by exponential kinetics. The existence of domains is supported by fluorescence microscopy data.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n** '''Strengths:''' Notably, this model explains the exponential kinetics of cargo exit of both large and small proteins, whereas other models cannot.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n** '''Weaknesses:''' This model cannot explain the transport kinetics of large protein cargo, such as collagen. This model falls short on explaining the observation of discrete compartments and polarized biochemistry of the Golgi cisternae. It also does not explain formation and disintegration of the Golgi network, nor the role of COPI vesicles.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n\n===Model 5: Stable compartments as cisternal model progenitors===\n* This is the most recent model. In this model, the Golgi is seen as a collection of stable compartments defined by [[Rab (G-protein)]] [[GTPase]]s.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n** '''Strengths:''' This model is consistent with numerous observations and encompasses some of the strengths of the cisternal progression/maturation model. Additionally, what is known of the Rab GTPase roles in mammalian endosomes can help predict putative roles within the Golgi. This model is unique in that it can explain the observation of \"megavesicle\" transport intermediates.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n** '''Weaknesses:''' This model does not explain morphological variations in the Golgi apparatus, nor define a role for COPI vesicles. This model does not apply well for plants, algae, and fungi in which individual Golgi stacks are observed (transfer of domains between stacks is not likely). Additionally, megavesicles are not established to be intra-Golgi transporters.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n\nThough there are multiple models that attempt to explain vesicular traffic throughout the Golgi, no individual model can independently explain all observations of the Golgi apparatus. Currently, the cisternal progression/maturation model is the most accepted among scientists, accommodating many observations across [[eukaryote]]s. The other models are still important in framing questions and guiding future experimentation. Among the fundamental unanswered questions are the directionality of COPI vesicles and role of Rab GTPases in modulating protein cargo traffic.<ref name=\"pmid21875986\"/>\n\n==Brefeldin A==\n[[Brefeldin A]] (BFA) is a fungal [[metabolite]] used experimentally to disrupt the secretion pathway as a method of testing Golgi function.<ref name=\"pmid18726174\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Marie M, Sannerud R, Avsnes Dale H, Saraste J | title = Take the 'A' train: on fast tracks to the cell surface. | journal = Cell Mol Life Sci | volume = 65 | issue = 18 | pages = 2859\u201374 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18726174 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-008-8355-0}}</ref> BFA blocks the activation of some [[ADP-ribosylation]] factors ([[ADP ribosylation factor|ARF]]s).<ref name=\"pmid16633337\">{{cite journal |vauthors=D'Souza-Schorey C, Chavrier P | title = ARF proteins: roles in membrane traffic and beyond. | journal = Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 347\u201358 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16633337 | doi = 10.1038/nrm1910}}</ref> ARFs are small [[GTPase]]s which regulate vesicular trafficking through the binding of COPs to [[endosome]]s and the Golgi.<ref name=\"pmid16633337\"/> BFA inhibits the function of several [[guanine nucleotide exchange factor]]s (GEFs) that mediate GTP-binding of ARFs.<ref name=\"pmid16633337\"/> Treatment of cells with BFA thus disrupts the secretion pathway, promoting disassembly of the Golgi apparatus and distributing Golgi proteins to the endosomes and ER.<ref name=\"pmid18726174\"/><ref name=\"pmid16633337\"/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:YeastGolgiMovieeLifec.ogg|Yeast Golgi dynamics.

So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code.

She visited most of Digital's engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks.\n\nShe often recounted that during her service she was frequently asked by admirals and generals why satellite communication would take so long.  So during many of her lectures, she illustrated a nanosecond using salvaged obsolete Bell System 25 pair telephone cable, she cut it to lengths of {{Convert|11.8|in|cm}}, [[Light-nanosecond|the distance that light travels in one nanosecond]], and handed out the individual wires to her listeners.
