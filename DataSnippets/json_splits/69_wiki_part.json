Examples include [[cholesterol]], [[phospholipids]] and [[triglyceride]]s.\n\nThe terms \"[[lipid]]\", \"[[oil]]\" and \"fat\" are often confused. \"Lipid\" is the general term, though a lipid is not necessarily a [[triglyceride]]. \"Oil\" normally refers to a lipid with short or [[Unsaturated (hydrocarbon)|unsaturated]] fatty acid chains that is liquid at [[room temperature]], while \"fat\" (in the strict sense) may specifically refer to lipids that are solids at room temperature \u2013 however, \"fat\" (in the broad sense) may be used in food science as a synonym for lipid. Fats, like other lipids, are generally [[hydrophobic]], and are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water.\n\nFat is an important foodstuff for many forms of life, and fats serve both structural and metabolic functions.  They are a necessary part of the [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] of most [[heterotroph]]s (including humans) and are the most energy dense, thus the most efficient form of energy storage<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/biomolecules/fat-and-protein-metabolism/v/introduction-to-energy-storage http://goo.gl/H7mItd}}</ref> and do not bind water thus do not increase body mass as much as proteins, especially carbohydrates, both of which bind a lot more water. \n\nSome fatty acids that are set free by the digestion of fats are called essential because they cannot be synthesized in the body from simpler constituents. There are two [[essential fatty acids]] (EFAs) in human nutrition: [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|alpha-linolenic acid]] (an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]) and [[linoleic acid]] (an [[omega-6 fatty acid]]).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Mozaffarian|first=Dariush|last2=Katan|first2=Martijn B.|last3=Ascherio|first3=Alberto|last4=Stampfer|first4=Meir J.|last5=Willett|first5=Walter C.|date=2006-04-13|title=Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra054035|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=15|pages=1601\u20131613|doi=10.1056/NEJMra054035|issn=0028-4793|pmid=16611951}}</ref><ref name=\"uk\" /> Other lipids needed by the body can be synthesized from these and other fats. Fats and other lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes called [[lipase]]s produced in the [[pancreas]].\n\nFats and oils are categorized according to the number and bonding of the carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain. Fats that are [[saturated fat]]s have no double bonds between the carbons in the chain. [[Unsaturated fat]]s have one or more double bonded carbons in the chain. The nomenclature is based on the non-acid (non-carbonyl) end of the chain. This end is called the omega end or the n-end. Thus [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|alpha-linolenic acid]] is called an [[omega-3 fatty acid]] because the 3rd carbon from that end is the first double bonded carbon in the chain counting from that end. Some oils and fats have multiple double bonds and are therefore called  [[polyunsaturated fats]]. Unsaturated fats can be further divided into [[cis fat]]s, which are the most common in nature, and [[trans fat]]s, which are rare in nature. Unsaturated fats can be altered by reaction with hydrogen effected by a catalyst. This action, called [[hydrogenation]], tends to break all the double bonds and makes a fully saturated fat. To make vegetable shortening, then, liquid ''cis''-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties e.g., they melt at a desirable temperature (30\u201340&nbsp;\u00b0C), and store well, whereas polyunsaturated oils go rancid when they react with oxygen in the air. However, [[trans fat]]s are generated during hydrogenation as contaminants created by an unwanted side reaction on the catalyst during partial hydrogenation.\n\nSaturated fats can stack themselves in a closely packed arrangement, so they can solidify easily and are typically solid at room temperature.  For example, animal fats [[tallow]] and [[lard]] are high in saturated fatty acid content and are solids.  Olive and linseed oils on the other hand are unsaturated and liquid. Fats serve both as energy sources for the body, and as stores for energy in excess of what the body needs immediately. Each gram of fat when burned or metabolized releases about 9 [[Calorie|food calories]] (37 [[Joule|kJ]] = 8.8 [[Calorie|kcal]]).<ref name=\"uk\">United Kingdom [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1499/contents/made The Food Labelling Regulations 1996] &ndash; [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1499/schedule/7/made Schedule 7: Nutrition labelling]</ref> Fats are broken down in the healthy body to release their constituents, [[Glycerin|glycerol]] and [[fatty acid]]s.  Glycerol itself can be converted to [[glucose]] by the liver and so become a source of energy.\n\n==Chemical structure==\n{{main| Triglyceride}}[[File:Triglyceride Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|Example of a natural triglyceride with three different fatty acids. One fatty acid is saturated (<span style=\"color:blue;\">'''blue'''</span> highlighted), another contains one [[double bond]] within the carbon chain (<span style=\"color:green;\">'''green'''</span> highlighted). The third  fatty acid (a polyunsaturated fatty acid, highlighted in <span style=\"color:red;\">'''red'''</span>) contains three [[double bond]]s within the carbon chain. All carbon-carbon double bonds shown are ''cis'' isomers. ]]\nThere are many different kinds of fats, but each is a variation on the same chemical structure.  All fats are derivatives of [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]. Most fats are [[glyceride]]s, particularly [[triglyceride]]s ([[ester|triesters]] of glycerol). One chain of fatty acid is bonded to each of the three -OH groups of the glycerol by the reaction of the carboxyl end of the fatty acid (-COOH) with the alcohol; I.e. three chains per molecule. Water is eliminated and the carbons are linked by an -O- bond through [[Condensation reaction|dehydration synthesis]]. This process is called [[esterification]] and fats are therefore [[ester]]s.  As a simple visual illustration, if the kinks and [[bond angle|angles]] of these chains were straightened out, the molecule would have the shape of a capital letter E.  The fatty acids would each be a horizontal line; the glycerol \"backbone\" would be the vertical line that joins the horizontal lines. Fats therefore have \"ester\" [[Chemical bond|bonds]].\n\nThe properties of any specific fat molecule depend on the particular fatty acids that constitute it.  Fatty acids form a family of compounds that are composed of increasing numbers of carbon atoms linked into a zig-zag chain (hydrogen atoms to the side). The more carbon atoms there are in any fatty acid, the longer its chain will be.  Long chains are more susceptible to intermolecular forces of attraction (in this case, [[van der Waals forces]]), and so the longer ones melt at a higher temperature ([[melting point]]).\n\n{|style=\"text-align:center; \" border=\"1\"\n|+Examples of [[fatty acids]].\n|-\n!

Stearic acid is neither ''cis'' nor ''trans'' because it has no carbon-carbon double bonds.\n|}\n\nFatty acid chains may also differ by length, often categorized as short to very long.\n* Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of fewer than six carbons (i.e. butyric acid).<sup>[4]</sup>\n* Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6\u201312<sup>[5]</sup> carbons, which can form medium-chain triglycerides.\n* Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 13 to 21 carbons.<sup>[6]</sup>\n* Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 22 or more carbons.\nAny of these aliphatic fatty acid chains may be glycerated and the resultant fats may have tails of different lengths from very short [[triformin]] to very long, e.g., cerotic acid, or ''hexacosanoic acid'', a 26-carbon long-chain saturated fatty acid. Long chain fats are exemplified by tallow (lard) whose chains are 17 carbons long. Most fats found in food, whether vegetable or animal, are made up of medium to long-chain fatty acids, usually of equal or nearly equal length. Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this energy. In particular, heart and skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids. Despite long-standing assertions to the contrary, fatty acids can also be used as a source of fuel for brain cells.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n=== Importance for living organisms ===\n\nFats are also sources of [[essential fatty acid]]s, an important dietary requirement. They provide energy as noted above. [[Vitamin]]s [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Vitamin E|E]], and [[Vitamin K|K]] are fat-soluble, meaning they can only be digested, absorbed, and transported in conjunction with fats. Fats play a vital role in maintaining healthy [[skin]] and [[hair]], insulating body organs against shock, maintaining body temperature, and promoting healthy cell function. Fat also serves as a useful buffer against a host of diseases. When a particular substance, whether chemical or biotic, reaches unsafe levels in the bloodstream, the body can effectively dilute\u2014or at least maintain equilibrium of\u2014the offending substances by storing it in new fat tissue. This helps to protect vital organs, until such time as the offending substances can be metabolized or removed from the body by such means as [[excretion]], [[urination]], accidental or intentional [[bloodletting]], [[sebum]] excretion, and [[hair]] growth.\n\n==Adipose tissue==\n[[File:Fatmouse.jpg|right|thumb|The [[obesity|obese]] [[mouse]] on the left has large stores of adipose tissue. For comparison, a mouse with a normal amount of adipose tissue is shown on the right.]]\n{{main|Adipose tissue}}\nIn animals, [[adipose tissue]], or fatty tissue is the body's means of storing metabolic energy over extended periods of time. [[Adipocyte]]s (fat cells) store fat derived from the diet and from liver [[metabolism]]. Under energy stress these cells may degrade their stored fat to supply fatty acids and also glycerol to the [[circulatory system|circulation]]. These metabolic activities are regulated by several hormones (e.g., [[insulin]], [[glucagon]] and [[epinephrine]]). Adipose tissue also secretes the hormone [[leptin]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/adipose|title=The human proteome in adipose - The Human Protein Atlas|website=www.proteinatlas.org|access-date=2017-09-12}}</ref>  \n\nThe location of the tissue determines its metabolic profile: [[visceral fat]] is located within the abdominal wall (i.e., beneath the wall of abdominal muscle) whereas \"[[subcutaneous fat]]\" is located beneath the skin (and includes fat that is located in the abdominal area beneath the skin but ''above'' the abdominal muscle wall).  Visceral fat was recently discovered to be a significant producer of signaling chemicals (i.e., [[hormone]]s), among which several are involved in inflammatory tissue responses. One of these is [[resistin]] which has been linked to obesity, [[insulin resistance]], and Type 2 diabetes. This latter result is currently controversial, and there have been reputable studies supporting all sides on the issue.\n\n==Fatty acids and human health==\n\nDietary consumption of fatty acids has effects on human health. Studies have found that replacing saturated fats with ''cis'' unsaturated fats in the diet reduces risk of cardiovascular disease. For example, a 2015 systematic review of randomized control trials by the [[Cochrane Library]] concluded: \"Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats.\"<ref>Hooper et al., [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011737/abstract;jsessionid=0DEB4D52F5ECDF485FAD400C5795A535.f02t04 \"Reduction in saturated fat intake for cardiovascular disease\"],''Cochrane Database Syst Rev''. 2015 Jun 10;'''(6)''':CD011737.</ref>\n\nNumerous studies have also found that consumption of ''trans'' fats increases risk of cardiovascular disease.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"uk\" />  The [[Harvard School of Public Health]] advises that replacing ''trans'' fats and saturated fats with ''cis'' monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats is beneficial for health.<ref> [https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/ \"Fats and Cholesterol\"], ''Harvard School of Public Health''.

Photograph taken by Capt. F. Hurley, sometime between August 1917 and August 1918.]]\nA '''front line''' (alternative forms: '''front-line''' or '''frontline''') in [[military terminology]] is the position(s) closest to the area of conflict of an armed force's personnel and equipment, generally referring to maritime or land forces. When a [[Front (military)|front]] (an intentional or unintentional boundary) between opposing sides form, the front line is the area where the armies are engaged in conflict, especially the line of contact between the opposing forces. In a military conflict, then, when facing the front line, you face the enemy.\n\nAll branches of the U.S. [[armed forces|armed services]] use the related technical terms, '''Forward Line of Own Troops (FLOT)''' and '''Forward Edge of Battle Area (FEBA)'''. These terms are used as [[battlespace control|battlespace control measures]] that designate the forward-most friendly maritime or land forces on the [[battlespace|battlefield]] at a given point in time during an [[armed conflict]].  FLOT/FEBA may include covering and screening forces. The '''Forward Line of Enemy Troops (FLET)''' is the FEBA from the enemy's perspective.\n\n==Etymology==\nAlthough the term \"front line\" first appeared in the 1520s, it was only in 1842 that it was recorded used in the military sense. Its first use as an adjective was from 1915.<ref>{{OEtymD|front-line}}</ref>\n\nThe word \"front\" gained the military sense of \"foremost part of an army\" in the mid-14th century, which, in turn, led the word to take on the meaning \"field of operations in contact with the enemy\" in the 1660s. That sense led to the phrase [[home front]], which first appeared in 1919.<ref>{{OEtymD|front}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Attributive adjective and predicative adjective|attributive adjective]] version of the term front line (as in \"our front-line personnel\") describes materiel or personnel intended for or actively in forward use: at sea, on land or in the air: ''at'' the front line.\n\n==Evolution of the concept==\nIn both the naval and land campaigns of [[World War I]], FEBAs, FLOTs and FLETs could often be identified by eye (for example, in France and Belgium, they were defined by opposing defensive trench systems).\n\nTypical modern conflicts are vastly different, characterised by \"war amongst the people\", the concept of a \"[[Three Block War]]\", and the presence of an asymmetric, 360\u00b0 threat from irregular or extremist, terrorist combatants. In those cases, the front line, FEBA, FLOT and FLET are almost conceptual ideas. The term \"front line\" has come to refer more to any place where bullets and bombs are flying or are likely to fly.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Area of responsibility]]\n* [[Command and control]]\n* [[Fog of war]]\n* [[Front (military)]]\n* [[List of command and control abbreviations]]\n* [[Network-centric warfare]]\n* [[Rear (military)]]\n* [[Salient (military)]]\n}}\n{{Portal bar|History|Language|War}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Front line}}\n* [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj92/fall92/fawcett.htm Which way to the FEBA?], Maj John M.

The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the [[Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques]] (USFSA) at the Rue Saint Honor\u00e9 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904.<ref>Classic Football History of FIFA \u2013 Foundation, https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/foundation.html</ref> The French name and acronym are used even outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of [[Royal Belgian Football Association|Belgium]], [[Danish Football Association|Denmark]], [[French Football Federation|France]], [[Royal Dutch Football Association|the Netherlands]], Spain (represented by the then-[[Real Madrid C.F.|Madrid Football Club]]; [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|the Royal Spanish Football Federation]] was not created until 1913), [[Swedish Football Association|Sweden]] and [[Swiss Football Association|Switzerland]]. Also, that same day, the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) declared its intention of affiliating through a telegram.<ref name=\"Filmcircle.com\" />\n\nThe first president of FIFA was [[Robert Gu\u00e9rin]]. Gu\u00e9rin was replaced in 1906 by [[Daniel Burley Woolfall]] from [[The Football Association|England]], by then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the [[Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics in London]] was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.{{dubious|date=June 2015}}\n\nMembership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of [[South African Football Association|South Africa]] in 1909, [[Argentine Football Association|Argentina]] in 1912, [[Canadian Soccer Association|Canada]] and [[Federaci\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol de Chile|Chile]] in 1913, and the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] in 1914.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/organisation/52/00/10/fs-120_01a_ma.pdf |title=FIFA's 208 Member Associations |accessdate=1 December 2015 |author=FIFA |date=10 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organisation was run by Dutchman [[Carl Anton Wilhelm Hirschmann|Carl Hirschmann]]. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the [[Home Nations]] (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their recent World War enemies.

Each national football association has one vote, regardless of its size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. The congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only the Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Congress elects the [[List of Presidents of FIFA|President of FIFA]], its general secretary, and the other members of the [[FIFA Council]] in the year following the [[FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=\"fifa-congress\">{{cite news |date=27 May 2011 |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/congress.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405100855/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/congress.html |archivedate=5 April 2010|title=FIFA Congress|publisher=FIFA}}</ref>\n\nFIFA Council \u2014 formerly called the FIFA Executive Committee and chaired by the president \u2014 is the main decision-making body of the organisation in the intervals of congress. The council is composed of 37 people: the president; 8 vice presidents; and 28 members from the confederations, with at least of them being a woman. The Executive Committee is the body that decides which country will host the World Cup.\n\nThe president and the general secretary are the main office holders of FIFA, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the general secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members. [[Gianni Infantino]] is the current president, elected on 26 February 2016 at an extraordinary FIFA Congress session after former president [[Sepp Blatter]] was suspended pending a [[2015 FIFA corruption case|corruption investigation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/08/iss-hayatou-acting-president-fifa-sepp-blatter-suspended|title=Issa Hayatou to be acting Fifa president following suspension of Sepp Blatter|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=8 October 2015|website=The Guardian|access-date=10 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Acting FIFA President Issa Hayatou|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/acting-president/index.html|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nFIFA's worldwide organisational structure also consists of several other bodies, under the authority of the FIFA Council or created by Congress as standing committees.

There is also a [[FIFA Women's World Rankings|world ranking for women's football]], updated four times a year.\n\n== Recognitions and awards ==\nFIFA holds an annual awards ceremony which recognises both individual and team achievements in international association football. Individually, the top men's player is awarded the [[FIFA Ballon d'Or]] and the top women's player is named [[FIFA World Player of the Year]]; the latter title was also awarded to the men's player prior to its 2010 merger with ''[[France Football]]''{{'}}s [[Ballon d'Or]]. At the Ballon d'Or banquet, the [[FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award]], [[FIFPro|FIFA/FIFPro Best XI]], [[FIFA Fair Play Award]], and [[FIFA Presidential Award]] are also awarded.\n\nIn 1994 FIFA published the [[FIFA World Cup All-Time Team]]. In 2000 FIFA published the results of an Internet poll, declaring [[Real Madrid]] to be the [[FIFA Club of the Century]]. In 2002 FIFA announced the [[FIFA Dream Team]], an all-time all-star team chosen by fans in a poll.\n\nAs part of its centennial celebrations in 2004, FIFA organised a \"Match of the Century\" between [[France national football team|France]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].\n\n== Governance and game development ==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}\n{{Main article|Laws of the Game (association football)}}\n[[File:FIFA-Headquarter.jpg|thumb|[[FIFA headquarters]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]]]]\n\nThe laws that govern football, known officially as the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]], are not solely the responsibility of FIFA; they are maintained by a body called the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB). FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: [[The Football Association|England]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Ireland]], who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognised for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates.\n\nThe FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing and ad-hoc committees.<ref>{{cite web|last=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW|title=FIFA TRANSFER REGULATIONS AND UEFA PLAYER  ELIGIBILITY RULES: MAJOR CHANGES IN EUROPEAN  FOOTBALL AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MINORS|url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf|publisher=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW|accessdate=28 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319030412/http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf|archivedate=19 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Discipline of national associations ===\nFIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organisations or if the associate is not functioning properly.\n\nA 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs, and appear in official matches for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of [[FIFA Two|two former Ireland internationals]]. As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with out-of-phase seasons.\n\n=== Video replay and Goal-line technology ===\n{{See also|Goal-line technology|Video assistant referee}}\n[[File:Flag of FIFA.svg|thumb|Flag of FIFA with the organisation's slogan]]\nFIFA now permits the use video evidence during matches, as well as for subsequent sanctions.

The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals'' ([[Harper Collins]]) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner [[International Sport and Leisure]] (ISL), and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for Sepp Blatter's continued control of FIFA.\n\nShortly after the release of ''Foul!'' a [[BBC]] television expos\u00e9 by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke for the BBC news programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' was broadcast. In this hour-long programme, screened on 11 June 2006, Jennings and the ''Panorama'' team agree that [[Sepp Blatter]] was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than \u00a31m worth of [[bribery|bribes]] pocketed by football officials. Lord Triesman, the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that \"behaves like a mafia family\", highlighting the association's \"decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs and corruption\".<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-27801996|title = BBC News Fifa 'like a mafia family' says former FA boss Triesman|date = 11 June 2014|accessdate = 3 October 2014|website = BBC News|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nAll testimonies offered in the Panorama expos\u00e9 were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one; Mel Brennan, formerly a lecturer at [[Towson University]] in the United States (and from 2001 to 2003 Head of Special Projects for [[CONCACAF]], a liaison to the e-FIFA project and a 2002 FIFA World Cup delegate), became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of greed, corruption, nonfeasance and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership. During the Panorama expos\u00e9, Brennan\u2014the highest-level African-American in the history of world football governance\u2014joined Jennings, Trinidadian journalist Lisana Liburd and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money at CONCACAF, and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviors at FIFA.

He claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totaling about $100&nbsp;million. A former ISL executive said that there were suspicions within ISL that the company was only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that another current official, [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Sepp Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels'.\n\nThe programme also criticized FIFA for allegedly requiring World Cup host bidding nations to agree to implement special laws for the World Cup, including a blanket tax exemption for FIFA and sponsors, and limitation of workers' rights. It alleged that governments of bidding nations are required to keep the details of the required laws confidential during the bidding process; but that they were revealed by the [[Dutch government]], which refused to agree to them, as a result of which it was told by FIFA that its bid could be adversely affected. According to the programme, following Jennings' earlier investigations he was banned from all FIFA press conferences, for reasons he says have not been made clear; and the accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations, either verbally or by letter.\n\n[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] [[David Cameron]] and [[Andy Anson]], head of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast, three days before FIFA's decision on the host for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], on the grounds that it might damage England's bid; the voters included officials accused by the programme.<ref>''Panorama'', [[BBC One]], 29 November 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11841783 \"Panorama: Three Fifa World Cup officials took bribe\"], [[BBC News]], 29 November 2010</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, it came to light that the [[IOC]] had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president [[Jo\u00e3o Havelange]] into claims of bribery. The BBC ''Panorama'' programme alleged that the Brazilian accepted a $1 million 'bung' in 1997 from ISL. The Olympic governing body said \"the IOC takes all allegations of corruption very seriously and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission\".<ref>{{cite news|author=International |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8581704/Fifa-honourary-president-Joao-Havelange-faces-IOC-inquiry.html |title=Fifa {{Sic|nolink=y|honou|rary|expected=honorary}} president Joao Havelange faces IOC inquiry |work=Daily Telegraph |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2014 interview, American sports writer [[Dave Zirin]] said greed, corruption, nonfeasance, and malfeasance are endemic to FIFA leadership, and that FIFA should be abolished for the good of the game. He said that currently, FIFA is in charge of both monitoring corruption in football matches, and marketing and selling the sport, but that two \"separate\" organizational bodies are needed: an organizational body that monitors corruption and match-fixing and the like, and an organization that's responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport. Zirin said the idea of having a single organization that's responsible for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport.<ref>[http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=12014 Dave Zirin: Abolish FIFA] (17 June 2014), [[Dave Zirin]], ''[[The Real News Network]]''</ref>\n\nIn May 2015, 14 people were arrested, including nine FIFA officials, after being accused of corruption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/several-top-fifa-officials-arrested|title=Fifa officials arrested on corruption charges as World Cup inquiry launched|author=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Guilty pleas===\nBetween 2013 and 2015 four individuals, and two sports television rights corporations pleaded guilty to United States financial misconduct charges.

The armed forces also enjoyed considerable autonomy....The Fascist militia was placed under military control....The judicial system was left largely intact and relatively autonomous as well. The police continued to be directed by state officials and were not taken over by party leaders...nor was a major new police elite created....There was never any question of bringing the Church under overall subservience.... Sizable sectors of Italian cultural life retained extensive autonomy, and no major state propaganda-and-culture ministry existed....The Mussolini regime was neither especially sanguinary nor particularly repressive.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley G.

Instead, claiming that Italians were a superior race to African races and thereby had the right to colonize the \"inferior\" Africans, it sought to settle 10 to 15 million Italians in Libya.<ref name=\"aaa134\" /> This resulted in an aggressive military campaign known as the [[Pacification of Libya]] against natives in Libya, including mass killings, the use of [[concentration camp]]s and the forced starvation of thousands of people.<ref name=aaa134/> Italian authorities committed [[ethnic cleansing]] by forcibly expelling 100,000 [[Bedouins|Bedouin]] Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica in Libya, from their settlements that was slated to be given to Italian settlers.<ref name=\"mussolini\" /><ref name=\"university44\" />\n\n====Hitler adopts Italian model====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1486, Hitler-Putsch, M\u00fcnchen, Marienplatz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Nazis in Munich during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]]]\nThe March on Rome brought Fascism international attention.

With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933, [[liberal democracy]] was dissolved in Germany and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s, the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]] and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups.\n\nFascist movements grew in strength elsewhere in Europe. Hungarian fascist [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]] rose to power as Prime Minister of [[Hungary]] in 1932 and attempted to entrench his [[Party of Hungarian Life|Party of National Unity]] throughout the country.

Mussolini called for [[Irredentism|irredentist]] Italian claims to be reclaimed, establishing Italian domination of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and securing Italian access to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the creation of Italian ''[[spazio vitale]]'' (\"vital space\") in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Red Sea]] regions.<ref name=\"expansionism50\" /> Hitler called for [[Irredentism|irredentist]] German claims to be reclaimed along with the creation of German ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") in Eastern Europe, including territories held by the [[Soviet Union]], that would be colonized by Germans.<ref name=\"expansionism51\" />\n\n[[File:Inmate at the Rab concentration camp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emaciation|Emaciated]] male inmate at the Italian [[Rab concentration camp]]]]\nFrom 1935 to 1939, Germany and Italy escalated their demands for territorial claims and greater influence in world affairs. Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded Ethiopia in 1935]] resulting in its condemnation by the [[League of Nations]] and its widespread diplomatic isolation. In 1936, Germany [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the industrial Rhineland]], a region that had been ordered demilitarized by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. In 1938, Germany annexed [[Austria]] and Italy assisted Germany in resolving the diplomatic crisis between Germany versus Britain and France over claims on [[Czechoslovakia]] by arranging the [[Munich Agreement]] that gave Germany the [[Sudetenland]] and was perceived at the time to have averted a European war. These hopes faded when Hitler violated the Munich Agreement by ordering the invasion and partition of Czechoslovakia between Germany and a client state of [[Slovakia]] in 1939. At the same time from 1938 to 1939, Italy was demanding territorial and colonial concessions from France and Britain.<ref name=\"university52\" /> In 1939, Germany prepared for war with Poland, but attempted to gain territorial concessions from Poland through diplomatic means.<ref name=\"Eugene Davidson pp. 371-372\" /> The Polish government did not trust Hitler's promises and refused to accept Germany's demands.<ref name=\"Eugene Davidson pp. 371-372\"/>\n\nThe invasion of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, resulting in their mutual declaration of war against Germany that was deemed the aggressor in the war in Poland, resulting in the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, Mussolini led Italy into World War II on the side of the Axis. Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry out a long war with France or the United Kingdom and waited until France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from the German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940 on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse.<ref name=\"university53\" /> Mussolini believed that following a brief entry of Italy into war with France, followed by the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain some territorial concessions from France and then concentrate its forces on a major offensive in [[Egypt]] where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces.<ref name=\"university54\" /> Plans by Germany to invade the United Kingdom in 1940 failed after Germany lost the aerial warfare campaign in the [[Battle of Britain]]. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. The war became prolonged\u2014contrary to Mussolini's plans\u2014resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance.\n\n[[File:Buchenwald Corpses 60623.jpg|thumb|right|Corpses of victims of the German [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]]]\nDuring World War II, the Axis Powers in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Poles, Jews, Gypsies and others in the [[genocide]] known as the [[Holocaust]].\n\nAfter 1942, Axis forces began to falter. In 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, the complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany, the Allied invasion of Italy and the corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini [[25 Luglio|was removed as head of government and arrested]] on the order of King Victor Emmanuel III, who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany faced multiple losses and steady Soviet and Western Allied offensives from 1943 to 1945.\n\nOn 28 April 1945, Mussolini was captured and executed by Italian communist partisans. On 30 April 1945, Hitler committed suicide. Shortly afterwards, Germany surrendered and the Nazi regime was [[denazification|systematically dismantled]] by the occupying Allied powers. An International Military Tribunal was subsequently convened in [[Nuremberg#Nazi era|Nuremberg]]. Beginning in November 1945 and lasting through 1949, numerous Nazi political, military and economic leaders were [[Nuremberg trials|tried and convicted]] of [[war crime]]s, with many of the worst offenders receiving the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].\n\n===Post\u2013World War II (1945\u2013present)===\n{{Main|Neo-fascism}}\n\n[[File:Juan Peron con banda de presidente.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Juan Per\u00f3n]], [[President of Argentina]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, admired [[Italian Fascism]] and modelled his economic policies on those pursued by Fascist Italy]]\n\nThe victory of the Allies over the Axis powers in [[World War II]] led to the collapse of many fascist regimes in Europe. The [[Nuremberg Trials]] convicted several Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust. However, there remained several movements and governments that were ideologically related to fascism.\n\n[[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Falangism|Falangist]] one-party state in Spain was officially neutral during World War II and it survived the collapse of the Axis Powers. Franco's rise to power had been directly assisted by the militaries of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and Franco had sent volunteers to fight on the side of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union during World War II. The first years were characterized by a repression against the anti-fascist ideologies, a deep censorship and the suppression of democratic institutions (elected Parliament, [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|Constitution of 1931]], Regional Statutes of Autonomy) . After World War II and a period of international isolation, Franco's regime normalized relations with the Western powers during the [[Cold War]], until Franco's death in 1975 and the transformation of Spain into a liberal democracy.\n\n[[File:Giorgio Almirante.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Giorgio Almirante]], leader of the [[Italian Social Movement]] from 1969\u20131987]]\n\nHistorian [[Robert Paxton]] observes that one of the main problems in defining fascism is that it was widely mimicked. Paxton says: \"In fascism's heyday, in the 1930s, many regimes that were not functionally fascist borrowed elements of fascist decor in order to lend themselves an aura of force, vitality, and mass mobilization\". He goes on to observe that Salazar \"crushed Portuguese fascism after he had copied some of its techniques of popular mobilization\".<ref>Robert O. Paxton, \"The five stages of fascism.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 70.1 (1998): 1-23, quotes  at pp 3, 17.</ref> [[Portugal]] was under the control of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], a dictatorship led by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]]. In Argentina, [[Peronism]], associated with the regime of [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, was  influenced by fascism.<ref name=\"Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 512\" /> Between 1939 and 1941, prior to his rise to power, Per\u00f3n had developed a deep admiration of Italian Fascism and modelled his economic policies on Italian Fascist policies.<ref name=\"Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 512\"/>\n\nThe term [[neo-fascism]] refers to fascist movements after World War II. In Italy, the [[Italian Social Movement]] led by [[Giorgio Almirante]] was a major neo-fascist movement that transformed itself into a self-described \"post-fascist\" movement called the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] (AN), which has been an ally of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]] for a decade. In 2008, AN joined Forza Italia in Berlusconi's new party [[The People of Freedom]], but in 2012 a group of politicians split from The People of Freedom, refounding the party with the name [[Brothers of Italy]]. In Germany, various neo-Nazi movements have been formed and banned in accordance with Germany's constitutional law which forbids Nazism. The [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD) is widely considered a neo-Nazi party, although the party does not publicly identify itself as such.\n\n[[File:Golden Dawn demonstration 1.jpg|thumb|right|Golden Dawn demonstration in Greece in 2012]]\nAfter the onset of the [[Great Recession]] and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]], widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and won seats in [[Greece]]'s parliament, espousing a staunch hostility towards minorities, illegal immigrants and refugees. In 2013, after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person with links to Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn's leader [[Nikolaos Michaloliakos]] and other Golden Dawn members on charges related to being associated with a criminal organization.\n\n==Tenets==\n[[Robert O. Paxton]] finds that the transformations undertaken by fascists in power were \"profound enough to be called 'revolutionary.'\" They \"often set fascists into conflict with conservatives rooted in families, churches, social rank, and property.\" Paxton argues: <blockquote>[F]ascism redrew the frontiers between private and public, sharply diminishing what had once been untouchably private. It changed the practice of citizenship from the enjoyment of constitutional rights and duties to participation in mass ceremonies of affirmation and conformity. It reconfigured relations between the individual and the collectivity, so that an individual had no rights outside community interest. It expanded the powers of the executive\u2014party and state\u2014in a bid for total control. Finally, it unleashed aggressive emotions hitherto known in Europe only during war or social revolution.<ref>[[Robert O. Paxton|Paxton, Robert O.]] (2004) ''The Anatomy Of Fascism''.

As Mussolini typically put it in early 1934, \"from 1929...fascism has become a universal phenomenon... The dominant forces of the 19th century, democracy, socialism, liberalism have been exhausted...the new political and economic forms of the twentieth-century are fascist'(Mussolini 1935: 32).<ref name=\"Fascism in Europe, 1919\u20131945\"/></blockquote>\n\nFascists criticized [[egalitarianism]] as preserving the weak, and they instead promoted social Darwinist views and policies.<ref name=\"egalitarianism\" /><ref name=\"university101\" /> They were in principle opposed to the idea of [[social welfare]], arguing that it \"encouraged the preservation of the degenerate and the feeble.\"<ref>[[Richard J.

Business leaders supported the government's political and military goals, and in exchange, the government pursued economic policies that maximized the profits of its business allies.<ref name=\"bloomington\"/> Nazi Germany transferred public ownership and public services into the private sector, while other Western capitalist countries strove for increased state ownership of industry.<ref name=\"www\"/> In his book, ''Big Business in the Third Reich'', Arthur Schweitzer notes that, \"Monopolistic price fixing became the rule in most industries, and cartels were no longer confined to the heavy or large-scale industries.&nbsp;... Cartels and quasi-cartels (whether of big business or small) set prices, engaged in limiting production, and agreed to divide markets and classify consumers in order to realize a monopoly profit.<ref name=\"bloomington85\"/>\n\nFascists pursued economic policies to strengthen state power and spread ideology, such as consolidating trade unions and putting them under state or party control.<ref name=\"pauley86\"/> Attempts were made by both Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany to establish \"[[autarky]]\" (self-sufficiency) through significant economic planning, but neither achieved economic self-sufficiency.<ref name=\"pauley87\"/>\n\n====National corporatism, statism and national syndicalism====\nItalian Fascism's economy was based on [[corporatism]], and a number of other fascist movements similarly promoted corporatism. [[Oswald Mosley]] of the [[British Union of Fascists]], describing fascist corporatism, said that \"it means a nation organized as the human body, with each organ performing its individual function but working in harmony with the whole\".<ref name=\"re208\"/> Fascists were not hostile to the ''[[petit-bourgeoisie]]'' or to small businesses, and they promised these groups, alongside the proletariat, protection from the upper-class bourgeoisie, big business, and Marxism. The promotion of these groups is the source of the term \"extremism of the centre\" to describe fascism.<ref name=\"gr101\"/>\n\nFascism blamed capitalist [[liberal democracies]] for creating class conflict and communists for exploiting it.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> In Italy, the Fascist period presided over the creation of the largest number of state-owned enterprises in [[Western Europe]], such as the nationalisation of [[petroleum]] companies into a single state enterprise called the Italian General Agency for Petroleum (''Azienda Generale Italiani Petroli'', AGIP).<ref name=\"publishing88\"/> Fascists made populist appeals to the [[middle class]], especially the lower middle class, by promising to protect small businesses and property owners from communism, and by promising an economy based on competition and profit while pledging to oppose big business.<ref name=gr101/>\n\nIn 1933, Benito Mussolini declared Italian Fascism's opposition to the \"decadent capitalism\" that he claimed prevailed in the world at the time, but he did not denounce capitalism entirely. Mussolini claimed that capitalism had degenerated in three stages, starting with dynamic or [[Heroic capitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|heroic capitalism]] (1830\u20131870), followed by static capitalism (1870\u20131914), and reaching its final form of decadent capitalism or \"[[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]]\" beginning in 1914.<ref name=\"fz136\"/> Mussolini said that Italian Fascism acknowledged the positive achievements of dynamic and heroic capitalism for its contribution to [[industrialism]] and its technical developments, but that it did not favor supercapitalism, which he claimed was incompatible with Italy's agricultural sector.<ref name=fz136/>\n\nThus Mussolini claimed that Italy under Fascist rule was not capitalist in the contemporary use of the term, which referred to supercapitalism.<ref name=fz136/> Mussolini denounced supercapitalism for causing the \"standardization of humankind\" and for causing excessive consumption.<ref name=\"aesthetics89\"/> Mussolini claimed that at the stage of supercapitalism, \"a capitalist enterprise, when difficulties arise, throws itself like a dead weight into the state's arms. It is then that state intervention begins and becomes more necessary. It is then that those who once ignored the state now seek it out anxiously.\"<ref name=\"establishing\"/> He saw Fascism as the next logical step to solve the problems of supercapitalism and claimed that \"our path would lead inexorably into [[state capitalism]], which is nothing more nor less than [[state socialism]] turned on its head. In either event, the result is the bureaucratization of the economic activities of the nation.\"<ref name=\"mb158-159\"/> Mussolini claimed that dynamic or heroic capitalism and the [[bourgeoisie]] could be prevented from degenerating into static capitalism and then supercapitalism if the concept of economic [[individualism]] were abandoned and if state supervision of the economy was introduced.<ref name=\"salvemini\"/> [[Private enterprise]] would control production but it would be supervised by the state.<ref name=\"Salvemini. p. 134\"/> By the late 1930s and the 1940s, Italian Fascism completely denounced capitalism as an obsolete and oppressive system, Mussolini in 1940 at the entry of Italy into World War II, said:\n{{quote|''This conflict must not be allowed to cancel out all our achievements of the past eighteen years, nor, more importantly, extinguish the hope of a Third Alternative held out by Fascism to mankind fettered between the pillar of capitalist slavery and the post of Marxist chaos. The proponents of these obsolete doctrines must understand that the Fascist sword has been unsheathed twice before, in Ethiopia and in Spain, with known results.''|Benito Mussolini, 1940.<ref name=\"mediterranean\"/>}}\n\nItalian Fascism presented the economic system of [[corporatism]] as the solution that would preserve private enterprise and property while allowing the state to intervene in the economy when private enterprise failed.<ref name=\"Salvemini. p. 134\"/>\n\nOther fascist regimes were indifferent or hostile to corporatism. The Nazis initially attempted to form a corporatist economic system like that of Fascist Italy, creating the National Socialist Institute for Corporatism in May 1933, which included many major economists who said that corporatism was consistent with National Socialism.<ref name=\"minneapolis90\"/><ref name=\"routledge91\"/> In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler spoke enthusiastically about the \"National Socialist corporative idea\" as one that eventually would \"take the place of ruinous class warfare\".<ref name=\"aristotle92\"/> The Nazis later came to view corporatism as detrimental to Germany and institutionalizing and legitimizing social differences within the German nation. Instead, the Nazis began to promote economic organization that emphasized the biological unity of the German national community.<ref name=\"minneapolis93\"/>\n\nHitler continued to refer to corporatism in propaganda, but it was not put into place, even though a number of Nazi officials such as [[Walther Darr\u00e9]], [[Gottfried Feder]], [[Alfred Rosenburg]], and [[Gregor Strasser]] were in favor of a [[Neo-medievalism|neo-medievalist]] form of corporatism, since corporations had been influential in German history in the [[medieval]] era.<ref name=\"ideologies\"/>\n\nSpanish Falangist leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera did not believe that corporatism was effective and denounced it as a propaganda ploy, saying \"this stuff about the corporative state is another piece of windbaggery\".<ref name=\"ideologies94\"/>\n\n====Economic planning====\nFascists opposed the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies that were dominant in the era prior to the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=\"political\"/> After the Great Depression began, many people from across the [[political spectrum]] blamed ''laissez-faire'' capitalism, and fascists promoted their ideology as a \"[[Third Position|third way]]\" between capitalism and [[communism]].<ref name=pm168/>\n\nFascists declared their opposition to [[finance capitalism]], [[interest]] charging, and profiteering.<ref name=\"university95\"/> [[Nazism|Nazis]] and other antisemitic fascists considered finance capitalism a \"[[Parasitism|parasitic]]\" \"[[antisemitism|Jewish conspiracy]]\".<ref name=\"socialism\"/> Fascist governments introduced [[Incomes policy|price controls]], wage controls and other types of [[Economic interventionism|economic interventionist]] measures.<ref name=\"Andreski-p64\"/>\n\nFascists thought that private property should be regulated to ensure that \"benefit to the community precedes benefit to the individual.\"<ref name=\"reconciling\"/> Private [[property]] rights were supported but were contingent upon service to the state.<ref name=\"neofascism\"/> For example, \"an owner of agricultural land may be compelled to raise wheat instead of sheep and employ more labour than he would find profitable.\"<ref name=\"comparative96\"/> They promoted the interests of successful small businesses.<ref name=\"fascist\"/> Mussolini wrote approvingly of the notion that profits should not be taken away from those who produced them by their own labour, saying \"I do not respect\u2014I even hate\u2014those men that leech a tenth of the riches produced by others\".<ref name=\"mussolini97\"/>\n\nAccording to historian Tibor Ivan Berend, \"[[dirigisme]]\" was an inherent aspect of fascist economies.<ref name=\"university98\"/> The [[Labour Charter of 1927]], promulgated by the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], stated in article 7: \"The corporative State considers private initiative, in the field of production, as the most efficient and useful instrument of the Nation\", then continued in article 9: \"State intervention in economic production may take place only where private initiative is lacking or is insufficient, or when are at stakes the political interest of the State. This intervention may take the form of control, encouragement or direct management.\"<ref name=\"corporativo\"/> -->\n\n==Criticism of fascism==\nFascism has been widely criticized and condemned in modern times since the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II.\n\n===Anti-democratic and tyrannical===\n{{further|Anti-democratic thought}}\n\n[[File:Hitler and Franco at Hendaye.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Hitler and Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Meeting at Hendaye]], on 23 October 1940]]\nOne of the most common and strongest criticisms of fascism is that it is a [[tyranny]].<ref>[[Roger Boesche]].

''Germany and the Second World War: Volume III: The Mediterranean, South-East Europe, and North Africa 1939\u20131941 (From Italy's Declaration of Non-Belligerence to the Entry of the United States into the War)'' (Oxford University Press, 1995) p. 111.</ref> [[Richard Washburn Child]], the American ambassador to Italy who worked with Mussolini and became his friend and admirer, defended Mussolini's opportunistic behaviour by writing: \"Opportunist is a term of reproach used to brand men who fit themselves to conditions for the reasons of self-interest. Mussolini, as I have learned to know him, is an opportunist in the sense that he believed that mankind itself must be fitted to changing conditions rather than to fixed theories, no matter how many hopes and prayers have been expended on theories and programmes\".<ref name=\"Benito Mussolini 1998\">Mussolini, Benito, ''My Rise And Fall, Volumes 1\u20132''. Da Capo Press ed. (Da Capo Press, 1998) p. ix. (Note: Mussolini wrote the second volume about his fall from power as head of government of the Kingdom of Italy in 1943, though he was restored to power in northern Italy by the German military.)</ref> Child quoted Mussolini as saying: \"The sanctity of an ism is not in the ism; it has no sanctity beyond its power to do, to work, to succeed in practice. It may have succeeded yesterday and fail to-morrow. Failed yesterday and succeed to-morrow. The machine first of all must run!\".<ref name=\"Benito Mussolini 1998\"/>\n\nSome have criticized Mussolini's actions during the outbreak of [[World War I]] as opportunist for seeming to suddenly abandon Marxist [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] for non-egalitarian [[nationalism]] and note to that effect that upon Mussolini endorsing Italy's intervention in the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary, he and the new fascist movement received financial support from foreign sources, such as [[Italian Ansaldo company|Ansaldo]] (an armaments firm) and other companies<ref>Smith, Dennis Mack,''Modern Italy; A Political History''.

''Mediterranean Fascism 1919\u20131945'' (Harper Rowe, 1970) p. 3.</ref> Mussolini's use of Nietzsche made him a highly unorthodox socialist, due to Nietzsche's promotion of elitism and anti-egalitarian views.<ref name=\"Golomb-Wistrich-2002-p-249\"/> Prior to World War I, Mussolini's writings over time indicated that he had abandoned the Marxism and egalitarianism that he had previously supported in favour of Nietzsche's ''\u00fcbermensch'' concept and anti-egalitarianism.<ref name=\"Golomb-Wistrich-2002-p-249\"/> In 1908, Mussolini wrote a short essay called \"Philosophy of Strength\" based on his Nietzschean influence, in which Mussolini openly spoke fondly of the ramifications of an impending war in Europe in challenging both religion and [[nihilism]]: \"[A] new kind of free spirit will come, strengthened by the war, ... a spirit equipped with a kind of sublime perversity, ... a new free spirit will triumph over God and over Nothing\".<ref name=\"Gigliola Gori 2004. p. 14\"/>\n\n===Ideological dishonesty===\nFascism has been criticized for being ideologically dishonest. Major examples of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian fascism's changing relationship with German Nazism.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. p. 17\">Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England; New York, New York: Routledge, 2001. p. 17.</ref><ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\">John Pollard. The Fascist Experience in Italy. Routledge, 1998. p. 129.</ref> Fascist Italy's official foreign policy positions were known to commonly utilize rhetorical ideological [[hyperbole]] to justify its actions, although during Dino Grandi's tenure as Italy's foreign minister the country engaged in ''[[realpolitik]]'' free of such fascist hyperbole.<ref>H. James Burgwyn. ''Italian Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period, 1918\u20131940''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. p. 58.</ref> Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934, when it celebrated Hitler's rise to power and meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy's allied leader in [[Austria]], [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], by Austrian Nazis; and again back to support after 1936, when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce Italy's invasion and occupation of [[Ethiopia]].\n\nAfter antagonism exploded between Nazi Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] over the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss in 1934, Mussolini and Italian fascists denounced and ridiculed Nazism's racial theories, particularly by denouncing its [[Nordic race|Nordicism]], while promoting [[Mediterraneanism]].<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\" /> Mussolini himself responded to Nordicists' claims of Italy being divided into Nordic and Mediterranean racial areas due to Germanic invasions of Northern Italy by claiming that while Germanic tribes such as the [[Lombards]] took control of Italy after the fall of Ancient Rome, they arrived in small numbers (about 8,000) and quickly assimilated into Roman culture and spoke the [[Vulgar Latin|Latin]] language within fifty years.<ref>Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England; New York, New York: Routledge, 2001. p. 93.</ref> Italian fascism was influenced by the tradition of Italian nationalists scornfully looking down upon Nordicists' claims and taking pride in comparing the age and sophistication of ancient Roman civilization as well as the classical revival in the [[Renaissance]] to that of Nordic societies that Italian nationalists described as \"newcomers\" to civilization in comparison.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. p. 17\"/> At the height of antagonism between the Nazis and Italian fascists over race, Mussolini claimed that the Germans themselves were not a pure race and noted with irony that the Nazi theory of German racial superiority was based on the theories of non-German foreigners, such as Frenchman [[Arthur de Gobineau]].<ref>Gillette, Aaron. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London, England; New York, New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 45.</ref> After the tension in German-Italian relations diminished during the late 1930s, Italian fascism sought to harmonize its ideology with German Nazism and combined Nordicist and Mediterranean racial theories, noting that Italians were members of the Aryan Race, composed of a mixed Nordic-Mediterranean subtype.<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\"/>\n\nIn 1938, Mussolini declared upon Italy's adoption of antisemitic laws that Italian fascism had always been antisemitic,<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\"/> In fact, Italian fascism did not endorse [[antisemitism]] until the late 1930s when Mussolini feared alienating antisemitic Nazi Germany, whose power and influence were growing in Europe. Prior to that period there had been notable Jewish Italians who had been senior Italian fascist officials, including [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who had also been Mussolini's mistress.<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\"/> Also contrary to Mussolini's claim in 1938, only a small number of Italian fascists were staunchly antisemitic (such as [[Roberto Farinacci]] and Giuseppe Preziosi), while others such as [[Italo Balbo]], who came from [[Ferrara]] which had one of Italy's largest Jewish communities, were disgusted by the antisemitic laws and opposed them.<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\"/> Fascism scholar Mark Neocleous notes that while Italian fascism did not have a clear commitment to antisemitism, there were occasional antisemitic statements issued prior to 1938, such as Mussolini in 1919 declaring that the Jewish bankers in London and New York were connected by race to the Russian [[Bolshevik]]s and that eight percent of the Russian Bolsheviks were Jews.<ref>Mark Neocleous.

The forge is used by the [[Smith (metalwork)|smith]] to heat a piece of metal to a temperature where it becomes easier to shape by [[forging]], or to the point where [[work hardening]] no longer occurs. The metal (known as the \"workpiece\") is transported to and from the forge using [[tongs]], which are also used to hold the workpiece on the smithy's [[anvil]] while the smith works it with a hammer. Sometimes, such as when hardening steel or cooling the work so that it may be handled with bare hands, the workpiece is transported to the [[#Slack tub|slack tub]], which rapidly cools the workpiece in a large body of water. However, depending on the metal type, it may require an oil quench or a salt brine instead; many metals require more than plain water hardening. The slack tub also provides water to control the fire in the forge.\n\n== Types ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\n\n=== Coal/coke/charcoal forge ===\n[[File:Coal-forge-diagram.svg|thumb|Bottom blast coal forge]]\n\nA forge typically uses [[bituminous coal]], industrial [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] or [[charcoal]] as the fuel to heat metal. The designs of these forges have varied over time, but whether the fuel is coal, coke or charcoal the basic design has remained the same.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anvilfire.com/FAQs/the_forge.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007030701/http://www.anvilfire.com/FAQs/the_forge.php |archivedate=2016-10-07 |df= }}</ref>\n\nA forge of this type is essentially a hearth or [[fireplace]] designed to allow a fire to be controlled such that metal introduced to the fire may be brought to a malleable state or to bring about other metallurgical effects ([[Hardening (metallurgy)|hardening]], [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], and [[Tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]] as examples). The forge fire in this type of forge is controlled in three ways:{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} amount of air, volume of fuel, and shape of the fuel/fire.\n\n[[File:Schmiedefeuer 2.jpg|thumb|A forge fire for [[hot working]] of metal]]\n\nOver thousands of years of forging, these devices have evolved in one form or another as the essential features of this type of forge:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Light|first=John D.|date=July 1987|title=Blacksmithing Technology and Forge Construction|jstor=3104997|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=28|pages=658\u2013665}}</ref>\n\n* [[Tuyere]]\u2014a pipe through which air can be forced into the fire\n* [[Bellows]] or blower\u2014a means for forcing air into the tuyere\n* Hearth\u2014a place where the burning fuel can be contained over or against the tuyere opening. Traditionally hearths have been constructed of mud brick ([[adobe]]), fired brick, stone, or later, constructed of iron.\n\nDuring operation, fuel is placed in or on the hearth and ignited. A source of moving air, such as a [[Mechanical fan|fan]] or bellows, introduces additional air into the fire through the tuyere. With additional air, the fire consumes more fuel and burns hotter (and cleaner - smoke can be thought of as escaped potential fuel.\n\n[[File:Smithyauchentiber.JPG|left|thumb|A typical Scottish smithy at [[Auchentiber]], North Ayrshire, Scotland.]]\n\nA [[blacksmith]] balances the fuel and air in the fire to suit particular kinds of work.  Often this involves adjusting and maintaining the shape of the fire.\n\nIn a typical coal forge, a firepot will be centered in a flat hearth. The tuyere will enter the firepot at the bottom. In operation, the hot core of the fire will be a ball of burning coke in and above the firepot. The heart of the fire will be surrounded by a layer of hot but not burning coke. Around the unburnt coke will be a transitional layer of coal being transformed into coke by the heat of the fire. Surrounding all is a ring or horseshoe-shaped layer of raw coal, usually kept damp and tightly packed to maintain the shape of the fire's heart and to keep the coal from burning directly so that it \"cooks\" into coke first.\n\nIf a larger fire is necessary, the smith increases the air flowing into the fire as well as feeding and deepening the coke heart. The smith can also adjust the length and width of the fire in such a forge to accommodate different shapes of work.\n\nThe major variation from the forge and fire just described is a 'back draft' where there is no fire pot, and the tuyere enters the hearth horizontally from the back wall.\n\nCoke and charcoal may be burned in the same forges that use coal, but since there is no need to convert the raw fuel at the heart of the fire (as with coal), the fire is handled differently.\n\nIndividual smiths and specialized applications have fostered development of a variety of forges of this type, from the coal forge described above, to simpler constructions amounting to a hole in the ground with a pipe leading into it.\n\n=== Gas forge ===\nA gas forge typically uses [[propane]] or [[natural gas]] as the fuel. One common, efficient design uses a cylindrical forge chamber and a burner tube mounted at a right angle to the body. The chamber is typically lined with [[refractory]] materials such as a hard castable refractory [[ceramic]] or a soft ceramic thermal blanket (ex: Kaowool). The burner mixes fuel and air which are ignited at the tip, which protrudes a short way into the chamber lining. The air pressure, and therefore heat, can be increased with a mechanical blower or by taking advantage of the [[Venturi effect]].\n\nGas forges vary in size and construction, from large forges using a big burner with a blower or several atmospheric burners to forges built out of a [[coffee]] can utilizing a cheap, simple propane torch. A small forge can even be carved out of a single soft [[firebrick]].\n\nThe primary advantage of a gas forge is ease of use, particularly for a novice. A gas forge is simple to operate compared to coal forges, and the fire produced is clean and consistent. They are less versatile, as the fire cannot be reshaped to accommodate large or unusually shaped pieces;. It is also difficult to heat a small section of a piece. A common misconception is that gas forges cannot produce enough heat to enable forge-[[welding]], but a well designed gas forge is hot enough for any task.\n\n=== Finery forge ===\n{{main|Finery forge}}\nA [[finery forge]] is a water-powered mill where [[pig iron]] is refined into [[wrought iron]].\n\n==Forging equipment==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}\n\n=== Anvil ===\n[[File:Anvil, labelled en.svg|thumb]]\n{{main|Anvil}}\nThe anvil serves as a work bench to the blacksmith, where the metal to be forged is placed. Anvils may seem clunky and heavy, but they are a highly refined tool carefully shaped to suit a blacksmith's needs. Anvils are made of cast or wrought iron with a tool steel face welded on or of a single piece of cast or forged tool steel. Some anvils are made of only cast iron, and have no tool steel face. These are not real anvils, and will not serve a blacksmith as such because they are too soft. A common term for a cast iron anvil is \"ASO\" or \"Anvil Shaped Object\". The purpose of a tool steel face on an anvil is to provide what some call \"Rebound\" as well as being hard and not denting easily from misplaced hammer blows. The term rebound means it projects some of the force of the blacksmith's hammer blows back into the metal thus moving more metal at once than if there were no rebound. A good anvil can project anywhere from 50 to 99% of the energy back into the workpiece.  The flat top, called the \"face\" is highly polished and usually has two holes (but can have more or less depending on the design). The square hole is called the hardy hole, where the square shank of the hardy tool fits. There are many different kinds of hardy tools. The smaller hole is called the pritchel hole, used as a bolster when punching holes in hot metal, or to hold tools similar to how the hardy tool does, but for tools that require being able to turn a 360 degree angle such as a hold down tool for when the blacksmith's tongs cannot hold a workpiece as securely as it needs to be. On the front of the anvil there is sometimes a \"horn\" that is used for bending, drawing out steel, and many other tasks. Between the horn and the anvil face there is often a small area called a \"step\" or a \"cutting table\" That is used for cutting hot or cold steel with chisels, and hot cut tools without harming the anvil's face. Marks on the face transfer into imperfections in the blacksmith's work.\n\n===Hammer===\n{{main|Hammer}}\nThere are many types of hammer used in a blacksmith's workshop but this will name just a few common ones. Hammers can range in shape and weight from a half an ounce to nearly 30 pounds depending on the type of work being done with it.\n\n# Hand hammer - used by the [[Blacksmith|smith]].\n#* [[Ball-peen hammer]]\n#* [[Ball-peen hammer|Cross-peen hammer]]\n#* [[Ball-peen hammer|Straight-peen hammer]]\n#* Rounding hammer\n# Sledge hammer - used by the [[Blacksmith's striker|striker]].\n\n=== Chisel ===\n{{main|Chisel}}\n[[Chisel]]s are made of high carbon steel. They are hardened and tempered at the cutting edge while the head is left soft so it will not crack when hammered. Chisels are of two types, hot and cold chisels. The cold chisel is used for cutting cold metals while the hot chisel is for hot metals. Usually hot chisels are thinner and therefore can not be substituted with cold chisels. Also many smiths shape chisels as to have a simple twisted handle as to resemble a hammer, they can be used at a greater distance away from the hot metals. They are very useful and found throughout the world.\n<ref>[http://www.school-of-blacksmithing.co.uk/make_tools/indiv_cold_chisel.html Peat Oberon's School of Blacksmithing: The cold chisel you will make on our 'Make your own tools' course<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828194645/http://www.school-of-blacksmithing.co.uk/make_tools/indiv_cold_chisel.html |date=2008-08-28 }}</ref>\n\n=== Tongs ===\n{{main|Tongs}}\nTongs are used by the blacksmith for holding hot metals securely. The mouths are custom made by the smith in various shapes to suit the gripping of various shapes of [[metal]]. It is not uncommon for a blacksmith to own twenty or more pairs of tongs; traditionally, a smith would start building their collection during apprenticeship.\nThere are various types of tongs available in market.\n(1) flat tong\n(2) rivet or ring tong\n(3) straight lip fluted tong\n(4) gad tong\n\n=== Fuller ===\n{{main|Fuller (metalworking)}}\nFullers are forming tools of different shapes used in making grooves or hollows. They are often used in pairs, the bottom fuller has a square shank which fits into the hardy hole in the anvil while the top fuller has a handle. The work is placed on the bottom fuller and the top is placed on the work and struck with a hammer. The top fuller is also used for finishing round corners and for stretching or spreading metal.\n\n=== Hardy ===\n{{main|Hardy (blacksmithing)}}\nThe hardy tool is a tool with a square shank that fits in a hardy hole.  There are many different kinds of hardy tool such as the hot cut hardy, used for cutting hot metal on the anvil; the fuller tool, used for drawing out metal and making grooves; bending jigs - and too many others to list.\n\n===Slack tub===\nA ''slack tub'' is usually a large container full of [[water]] used by a blacksmith to [[quench]] hot metal. The slack tub is principally used to cool parts of the work during forging (to protect them, or keep the metal in one area from \"spreading\" from, for example, nearby hammer blows); to harden the steel; to tend a coal or charcoal forge; and simply to cool the work quickly for easy inspection. In blade smithing and tool making the term will usually be changed to a \"quench tank\" because [[oil]] or [[brine]] is used to cool the metal. The term slack is believed to derive from the word \"slake\", as in slaking the heat.\n\n== Types of forging ==\n{{main|Forging}}\n\n=== Drop forging ===\nDrop forging is a process used to shape metal into complex shapes by dropping a heavy hammer with a die on its face onto the work piece.<ref>Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide; Todd, Allen, Alting</ref>\n\n==== Process ====\nThe workpiece is placed into the forge. Then the impact of a hammer causes the heated material, which is very malleable, to conform to the shape of the die and die cavities. Typically only one die is needed to completely form the part. Extra space between the die faces causes some of the material to be pressed out of the sides, forming [[Flash (manufacturing)|flash]]. This acts as a relief valve for the extreme pressure produced by the closing of the die halves and is later trimmed off of the finished part.\n\n==== Equipment ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\nThe equipment used in the drop forming process is commonly known as a [[Power hammer|power]] or drop hammer. These may be powered by air, hydraulics, or mechanics.  Depending on how the machine is powered, the mass of the ram, and the drop height, the striking force can be anywhere from 11,000 to 425,000 pounds.\nThe tools that are used, dies and punches, come in many different shapes and sizes, as well as materials.  Examples of these shapes are flat and v-shaped which are used for open-die forging, and single or multiple-impression dies used for closed die-forging.  The designs for the dies have many aspects to them that must be considered.  They all must be properly aligned, they must be designed so the metal and the flash will flow properly and fill all the grooves, and special considerations must be made for supporting webs and ribs and the parting line location.  The materials must also be selected carefully.  Some factors that go into the material selection are cost, their ability to harden, their ability to withstand high pressures, hot abrasion, heat cracking, and other such things.  The most common materials used for the tools are carbon steel and, in some cases, nickel based alloys.\n\n==== Workpiece materials ====\nThe materials that are used most commonly in drop forging are aluminum, copper, nickel, mild steel, stainless steel, and magnesium.  Mild steel is the best choice, and magnesium generally performs poorly as a drop forging material.\n\n== Gallery ==\n{{Cleanup gallery|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Photography===\n<gallery widths=200 heights=150>\nFile:Schmiedefeuer.jpg|Forge fire\nFile:GoodhueGatesandRailingsBrakeDrumCoalForge 023.jpg|Brake Drum Coal Forge\nFile:0 typical smithy in finland.JPG|A typical smithy in [[Finland]]\nFile:3 tourist helping artist blacksmith in finland.JPG|Lokomo [[anvil]] in use\n</gallery>\n\n===In art===\n{{further|commons:Category:Forges_in_art}}\n<gallery widths=250 heights = 300 >\nFile:Cornelis Gerritsz Decker (Umkreis) In der Schmiede.jpg|A 17th-century painting from the school of [[Cornelis Gerritsz Decker]] of men around a forge\nFile:Spectre over Los from William Blake's Jeruesalem.jpg|The artist [[William Blake]] used the blacksmith as a motif in [[William Blake's mythology|his own extensive mythology]].

''Salah'' consists of five daily prayers according to the Sunna; the names are according to the prayer times: ''[[Fajr]]'' (dawn), ''[[Dhuhr]]'' (noon), ''[[Asr|\u02bfA\u1e63r]]'' (afternoon), ''[[Maghrib]]'' (evening), and ''[[Isha'|\u02bfIsh\u0101\u02be]]'' (night). The Fajr prayer is performed before sunrise, Dhuhr is performed in the midday after the sun has surpassed its highest point, Asr is the evening prayer before sunset, Maghrib is the evening prayer after sunset and Isha is the night prayer. All of these prayers are recited while facing in the direction of the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] and form an important aspect of the Muslim Ummah. Muslims must wash before prayer; this washing is called ''[[wudu]]'' (\"purification\"). The prayer is accompanied by a series of set positions including; bowing with hands on knees, standing, prostrating and sitting in a special position (not on the heels, nor on the buttocks). A [[Muslim]] may perform their prayer anywhere, such as in offices, universities, and fields. However, the [[mosque]] is the more preferable place for prayers because the mosque allows for fellowship.\n\n===Zak\u0101t: Charity===\n''[[Zak\u0101t]]'' or [[alms|alms-giving]] is the practice of charitable giving based on accumulated wealth. The word zak\u0101t can be defined as purification and growth because it allows an individual to achieve balance and encourages new growth. The principle of knowing that all things belong to God is essential to purification and growth. Zak\u0101t is obligatory for all Muslims who are able to do so. It is the personal responsibility of each Muslim to ease the economic hardship of others and to strive towards eliminating inequality.<ref>Ridgeon (2003), p.258</ref> Zak\u0101t consists of spending a portion of one's wealth for the benefit of the poor or needy, like debtors or travelers. A Muslim may also donate more as an act of voluntary charity (''[[sadaqah]]''), rather than to achieve additional divine reward.<ref>Zakat, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam Online''</ref>\n\nThere are five principles that should be followed when giving the zak\u0101t:\n# The giver must declare to God his intention to give the zak\u0101t.\n# The zak\u0101t must be paid on the day that it is due.\n# After the offering, the payer must not exaggerate on spending his money more than usual means.\n# Payment must be in kind. This means if one is wealthy then he or she needs to pay a portion of their income. If a person does not have much money, then they should compensate for it in different ways, such as good deeds and good behavior toward others.\n# The zak\u0101t must be distributed in the community from which it was taken.<ref>[http://public.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ZAKAT.HTM Zakat Alms-giving]{{Dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>'''\n\n===Sawm: Fasting===\n[[File:Date-seller.jpg|thumb|[[Muslim]]s traditionally break their fasts in the [[Ramadan (calendar month)|month of Ramadan]] with [[Date palm#Fruit|dates]] (like those offered by this date seller in [[Kuwait City]]), as was the recorded practice ([[Sunnah]]) of [[Muhammad]].]]\nThree types of [[fasting]] (''[[Siyam]]'') are recognized by the Quran: Ritual fasting,<ref>{{cite quran|2|183|end=187|s=ns}}</ref> fasting as compensation for repentance (both from [[sura]] [[Al-Baqara]]),<ref>{{cite quran|2|196|s=ns}}</ref> and ascetic fasting (from [[Al-Ahzab]]).<ref>{{cite quran|33|35|s=ns}}</ref><ref>Fasting, ''Encyclopedia of the Qur'an'' (2005)</ref>\n\nRitual fasting is an obligatory act during the month of [[Ramadan]].<ref name=\"Caesar_1\">Farah (1994), p.144-145</ref> Muslims must abstain from food and drink from dawn to dusk during this month, and are to be especially mindful of other sins.<ref name=\"Caesar_1\"/> Fasting is necessary for every Muslim that has reached puberty (unless he/she suffers from a medical condition which prevents him/her from doing so).<ref>talhaanjum_9</ref>\n\nThe fast is meant to allow Muslims to seek nearness and to look for forgiveness from God, to express their gratitude to and dependence on him, atone for their past sins, and to remind them of the needy.<ref>Esposito (1998), p.90,91</ref> During Ramadan, Muslims are also expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam by refraining from violence, anger, envy, greed, lust, profane language, gossip and to try to get along with fellow Muslims better. In addition, all obscene and irreligious sights and sounds are to be avoided.<ref>Tabatabaei (2002), p. 211,213</ref>\n\n[[Fasting during Ramadan]] is obligatory, but is forbidden for several groups for whom it would be very dangerous and excessively problematic. These include pre-pubescent children, those with a medical condition such as [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Old age|elderly people]], and [[pregnancy|pregnant]] or [[breastfeeding]] women. Observing fasts is not permitted for menstruating women. Other individuals for whom it is considered acceptable not to fast are those who are ill or traveling. Missing fasts usually must be made up for soon afterward, although the exact requirements vary according to circumstance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_21.html#HEADING20 |title=For whom fasting is mandatory |publisher=USC-MSA Compendium of Muslim Texts |accessdate=2007-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308025221/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_21.html |archivedate=8 March 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite quran|2|184|style=ref}}</ref><ref>Khan (2006), p. 54</ref><ref>Islam, ''The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' (2005)</ref>\n\n===Hajj: pilgrimage to Mecca===\nThe ''[[Hajj]]'' is a [[pilgrimage]] that occurs during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] to the holy city of [[Mecca]].

Both men and women are required to make the pilgrimage to Mecca. After a Muslim makes the trip to Mecca, he/she is known as a [[Hajji|hajj/hajja]] (one who made the pilgrimage to Mecca).<ref name=\"Britannica_India\">Hoiberg (2000), p.237\u2013238</ref> The main rituals of the Hajj include walking seven times around the Kaaba termed ''[[Tawaf]]'', touching the [[Black Stone]] termed Istilam, traveling seven times between [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Mount Safa and Mount Marwah]] termed ''[[Sa'yee]]'', and symbolically [[Stoning of the Devil|stoning the Devil]] in [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]] termed Ramee.<ref name=\"Britannica_India\"/>\n\nThe [[pilgrim]], or the ''haji'', is honoured in the Muslim community. Islamic teachers say that the Hajj should be an expression of devotion to God, not a means to gain social standing. The believer should be self-aware and examine their intentions in performing the pilgrimage. This should lead to constant striving for self-improvement.<ref>Goldschmidt (2005), p.48</ref> A pilgrimage made at any time other than the Hajj season is called an ''[[Umrah]]'', and while not mandatory is strongly recommended. Also, they make a pilgrimage to the holy city of [[Jerusalem]] in their alms-giving feast.\n\n==Pillars of Shia Islam==\n\n=== Twelvers ===\nTwelver Shia Islam has five Usul al-Din and ten Furu al-Din, i.e., the [[Shia Islamic beliefs and practices]]. The Twelver Shia Islam Usul al-Din, equivalent to a Shia Five Pillars, are all beliefs considered foundational to Islam, and thus classified a bit differently from those listed above.<ref>See chapter on \"Islamic Beliefs (the Pillars of Islam)\" in Invitation to Islam by [[Sayed Moustafa Al-Qazwini]]. http://www.al-islam.org/invitation/</ref> They are:\n\n# ''[[Tawhid]]'' (monotheism: belief in the oneness of Allah)\n# ''[[Adl]]'' (divine justice: belief in Allah's justice)\n# ''[[Nubuwwah]]'' (prophethood)\n# ''[[Imamah (Shia) |Imamah]]'' (succession to Muhammad)\n# ''[[Mi'ad]]'' (the day of judgment and the resurrection)\n\nIn addition to these five pillars, there are ten practices that Shia Muslims must perform, called the ''[[Ancillaries of the Faith]]''<ref>Walsh, John Evangelist.

Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press/Popular Press, 2004.</ref> (Arabic: '''fur\u016b\u02bf al-d\u012bn''').\n\n# [[Salah]]\n# [[Sawm]]\n# [[Zakat]], similar to Sunni Islam, it applies to money, cattle, silver, gold, dates, raisins, wheat, and barley.\n# [[Khums]]: an annual taxation of one-fifth (20%) of the gains that a year has been passed on without using.

This property can have dramatic consequences, as illustrated by the use of friction created by rubbing pieces of wood together to start a fire. Kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy whenever motion with friction occurs, for example when a [[Viscous flow|viscous]] fluid is stirred. Another important consequence of many types of friction can be [[wear]], which may lead to performance degradation or damage to components. Friction is a component of the science of [[tribology]].\n\nFriction is desirable and important in supplying [[traction (engineering)|traction]] to facilitate motion on land. Most [[land vehicle]]s rely on friction for acceleration, deceleration and changing direction. Sudden reductions in traction can cause loss of control and accidents.\n \nFriction is not itself a [[fundamental force]]. Dry friction arises from a combination of inter-surface adhesion, surface roughness, surface deformation, and surface contamination. The complexity of these interactions makes the calculation of friction from [[first principle]]s  impractical and necessitates the use of [[empirical method]]s for analysis and the development of theory.\n\nFriction is a [[Conservative force#Nonconservative forces|non-conservative force]] - work done against friction is path dependent. In the presence of friction, some energy is always lost in the form of heat. Thus [[mechanical energy]] is not conserved.\n\n==History==\nThe Greeks, including [[Aristotle]], [[Vitruvius]], and [[Pliny the Elder]], were interested in the cause and mitigation of friction.<ref name=Chatterjee2008>{{cite thesis |last=Chatterjee |first=Sudipta |year=2008 |title=Tribological Properties of Pseudo-elastic Nickel-titanium |publisher=University of California |via=ProQuest |isbn=9780549844372 |pages=11\u201312 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rX6xfoEaYtQC&pg=PA12 |quote=Classical Greek philosophers like Aristotle, Pliny the Elder and Vitruvius wrote about the existence of friction, the effect of lubricants and the advantages of metal bearings around 350 B.C.}}</ref> They were aware of differences between static and kinetic friction with [[Themistius]] stating in 350 {{Smallcaps2|A.D.}} that \"it is easier to further the motion of a moving body than to move a body at rest\".<ref name=Chatterjee2008/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Fishbane |first1=Paul M. |last2=Gasiorowicz |first2=Stephen |last3=Thornton |first3=Stephen T. |year=1993 |title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers |edition=Extended |volume=I |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn=0-13-663246-7 |page=135 |quote=Themistius first stated around 350 {{Smallcaps2|{{sic|B.C.|expected=A.D.}}}} that kinetic friction is weaker than the maximum value of static friction.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hecht |first=Eugene |date=2003 |title=Physics: Algebra/Trig |edition=3rd |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=9780534377298}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Sambursky |first=Samuel |date=2014 |title=The Physical World of Late Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400858989 |pages=65\u201366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yvz_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA65}}</ref>\n\nThe classic laws of sliding friction were discovered by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]  in 1493, a pioneer in [[tribology]], but the laws documented in his notebooks, were not published and remained unknown.<ref name=\"Dowson\" >{{cite book |last=Dowson |first=Duncan |year=1997 |title=History of Tribology |edition=2nd |publisher=Professional Engineering Publishing |isbn=1-86058-070-X}}</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong\" >{{cite book |last=Armstrong-H\u00e9louvry |first=Brian |year=1991 |title=Control of machines with friction |publisher=Springer |location=USA |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0zk_zI3xACgC&pg=PA10 |isbn=0-7923-9133-0}}</ref><ref name=\"VanBeek\">{{cite web |last=van Beek |first=Anton |title=History of Science Friction |publisher=tribology-abc.com |url=http://www.tribology-abc.com/abc/history.htm |accessdate=2011-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Hutchings |first=Ian M.  |date=2016 |title=Leonardo da Vinci's studies of friction |doi=10.1016/j.wear.2016.04.019 |url=http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/uploads/Hutchings_Leonardo_Friction_2016_v2.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Hutchings |first=Ian M. |date=2016-08-15 |title=Leonardo da Vinci's studies of friction |journal=Wear |doi=10.1016/j.wear.2016.04.019 |volume=360\u2013361 |pages=51\u201366 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043164816300588}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kirk |first=Tom |date=July 22, 2016 |title=Study reveals Leonardo da Vinci's 'irrelevant' scribbles mark the spot where he first recorded the laws of friction |website=phys.org |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-07-reveals-leonardo-da-vinci-irrelevant.html |access-date=2016-07-26}}</ref> These laws were rediscovered by [[Guillaume Amontons]] in 1699<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Popova|first=Elena|last2=Popov|first2=Valentin L.|date=2015-06-01|title=The research works of Coulomb and Amontons and generalized laws of friction|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40544-015-0074-6|journal=Friction|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=183\u2013190|doi=10.1007/s40544-015-0074-6|issn=|via=}}</ref> and became known as Amonton's three laws of dry friction ''(below)''.

The distinction between static and dynamic friction is made in Coulomb's friction law (see below), although this distinction was already drawn by [[Johann Andreas von Segner]] in 1758.<ref name=\"Dowson\" />\nThe effect of the time of repose was explained by [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] (1762) by considering the surfaces of fibrous materials, with fibers meshing together, which takes a finite time in which the friction increases.\n\n[[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]] (1766\u20131832) noted a weakness in the views of Amontons and Coulomb: If friction arises from a weight being drawn up the inclined plane of successive [[Asperity (materials science)|asperities]], why then isn't it balanced through descending the opposite slope? Leslie was equally skeptical about the role of adhesion proposed by Desaguliers, which should on the whole have the same tendency to accelerate as to retard the motion.<ref name=\"Dowson\" /> In Leslie's view, friction should be seen as a time-dependent process of flattening, pressing down asperities, which creates new obstacles in what were cavities before.\n\n[[Arthur Jules Morin]] (1833) developed the concept of sliding versus rolling friction.  [[Osborne Reynolds]] (1866) derived the equation of viscous flow.  This completed the classic empirical model of friction (static, kinetic, and fluid) commonly used today in engineering.<ref name=\"Armstrong\" /> In 1877,  [[Fleeming Jenkin]] and [[James Alfred Ewing|J. A. Ewing]] investigated the continuity between static and kinetic friction.<ref>[[Fleeming Jenkin]] & [[James Alfred Ewing]] (1877) \"[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/121556#page/322/mode/1up On Friction between Surfaces moving at Low Speeds]\", ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'' Series 5, volume 4, pp 308\u201310; link from [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]]</ref>\n\nThe focus of research during the [[20th century]] has been to understand the physical mechanisms behind friction. [[Frank Philip Bowden]] and [[David Tabor]] (1950) showed that, at a [[Microscopic scale|microscopic level]], the actual area of contact between surfaces is a very small fraction of the apparent area.<ref name=\"VanBeek\" />  This actual area of contact, caused by asperities increases with pressure. The development of the [[atomic force microscope]] (ca. 1986)  enabled scientists to study friction at the [[Atomic units|atomic scale]],<ref name=\"Armstrong\" /> showing that, on that scale, dry friction is the product of the inter-surface [[shear stress]] and the contact area. These two discoveries explain Amonton's first law ''(below)''; the macroscopic proportionality between normal force and static frictional force between dry surfaces.\n\n==Laws of dry friction==\nThe elementary property of sliding (kinetic) friction were discovered by experiment in the 15th to 18th centuries and were expressed as three empirical laws:\n*'''[[Guillaume Amontons#Amontons' Laws of Friction|Amontons']]  First Law''': The force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load.\n*'''Amontons' Second Law''': The force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact.\n*'''Coulomb's Law of Friction''': Kinetic friction is independent of the sliding velocity.\n\n==Dry friction<!--Charles-Augustin de Coulomb links here-->==\nDry friction resists relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. The two regimes of dry friction are 'static friction' (\"[[stiction]]\") between non-moving surfaces, and ''kinetic friction'' (sometimes called sliding friction or dynamic friction) between moving surfaces.\n\nCoulomb friction, named after [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], is an approximate model used to calculate the force of dry friction. It is governed by the model:\n\n:<math>F_\\mathrm{f} \\leq \\mu F_\\mathrm{n},</math>\nwhere\n*<math>F_\\mathrm{f}\\,</math> is the force of friction exerted by each surface on the other.  It is parallel to the surface, in a direction opposite to the net applied force.\n*<math>\\mu\\,</math> is the coefficient of friction, which is an empirical property of the contacting materials,\n*<math>F_\\mathrm{n}\\,</math> is the [[normal force]] exerted by each surface on the other, directed perpendicular (normal) to the surface.\n\nThe Coulomb friction <math>F_\\mathrm{f}\\,</math> may take any value from zero up to <math>\\mu F_\\mathrm{n}\\,</math>, and the direction of the frictional force against a surface is opposite to the motion that surface would experience in the absence of friction. Thus, in the static case, the frictional force is exactly what it must be in order to prevent motion between the surfaces; it balances the net force tending to cause such motion. In this case, rather than providing an estimate of the actual frictional force, the Coulomb approximation provides a threshold value for this force, above which motion would commence. This maximum force is known as [[Traction (engineering)|traction]].\n\nThe force of friction is always exerted in a direction that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a [[curling]] stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note that it is not the direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.\n\n===Normal force===\n[[Image:Free body diagram2.svg|right|200px|thumb|[[Free-body diagram]] for a block on a ramp. Arrows are [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] indicating directions and magnitudes of forces. ''N'' is the normal force, ''mg'' is the force of [[gravity]], and ''F<sub>f</sub>'' is the force of friction.]]\n\n{{Main article|Normal force}}\n\nThe normal force is defined as the net force compressing two parallel surfaces together; and its direction is perpendicular to the surfaces. In the simple case of a mass resting on a horizontal surface, the only component of the normal force is the force due to gravity, where <math>N=mg\\,</math>. In this case, the magnitude of the friction force is the product of the mass of the object, the acceleration due to gravity, and the coefficient of friction. However, the coefficient of friction is not a function of mass or volume; it depends only on the material. For instance, a large aluminum block has the same coefficient of friction as a small aluminum block. However, the magnitude of the friction force itself depends on the normal force, and hence on the mass of the block.\n\nIf an '''object is on a level surface''' and the force tending to cause it to slide is horizontal, the normal force <math>N\\,</math> between the object and the surface is just its weight, which is equal to its [[mass]] multiplied by the [[acceleration]] due to earth's gravity, ''[[standard gravity|g]]''. If the '''object is on a tilted surface''' such as an inclined plane, the normal force is less, because less of the force of gravity is perpendicular to the face of the plane. Therefore, the normal force, and ultimately the frictional force, is determined using [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] analysis, usually via a [[free body diagram]]. Depending on the situation, the calculation of the normal force may include forces other than gravity.\n\n===Coefficient of friction===\nThe '''coefficient of friction''' (COF), often symbolized by the Greek letter [[Mu (letter)|\u00b5]], is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] value which describes the ratio of the force of friction between two bodies and the force pressing them together. The coefficient of friction depends on the materials used; for example, ice on steel has a low coefficient of friction, while rubber on pavement has a high coefficient of friction. Coefficients of friction range from near zero to greater than one.  It is an axiom of the nature of friction between metal surfaces that it is greater between two surfaces of similar metals than between two surfaces of different metals\u2014 hence, brass will have a higher coefficient of friction when moved against brass, but less if moved against steel or aluminum.<ref name=\"Association1921\">{{cite book|author=Air Brake Association|title=The Principles and Design of Foundation Brake Rigging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoNBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA5|year=1921|publisher=Air brake association|page=5}}</ref>\n\nFor surfaces at rest relative to each other <math>\\mu = \\mu_\\mathrm{s}\\,</math>, where <math>\\mu_\\mathrm{s}\\,</math> is the ''coefficient of static friction''. This is usually larger than its kinetic counterpart. The coefficient of static friction exhibited by a pair of contacting surfaces depends upon the combined effects of material deformation characteristics and [[surface roughness]], both of which have their origins in the [[chemical bonding]] between atoms in each of the bulk materials and between the material surfaces and any [[adsorption|adsorbed material]]. The [[fractal]]ity of surfaces, a parameter describing the scaling behavior of surface asperities, is known to play an important role in determining the magnitude of the static friction.<ref name=\"statfric\">{{cite journal|last1= Hanaor | first1= D. | last2=Gan |first2= Y. |last3=Einav | first3= I. | title= Static friction at fractal interfaces| journal= Tribology International | year=2016 | volume=93 | pages=229\u2013238 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dorian_Hanaor/publication/283675011_Static_friction_at_fractal_interfaces/links/5645bda508ae9f9c13e6f162.pdf}}</ref>\n\nFor surfaces in relative motion <math>\\mu = \\mu_\\mathrm{k}\\,</math>, where <math>\\mu_\\mathrm{k}\\,</math> is the ''coefficient of kinetic friction''. The Coulomb friction is equal to <math>F_\\mathrm{f}\\,</math>, and the frictional force on each surface is exerted in the direction opposite to its motion relative to the other surface.\n\n[[Arthur Morin]] introduced the term and demonstrated the utility of the coefficient of friction.<ref name=\"Dowson\" /> The coefficient of friction is an [[empirical]] [[measurement]] \u2013 it has to be measured [[experiment]]ally, and cannot be found through calculations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Rougher surfaces tend to have higher effective values. Both static and kinetic coefficients of friction depend on the pair of surfaces in contact; for a given pair of surfaces, the coefficient of static friction is ''usually'' larger than that of kinetic friction; in some sets the two coefficients are equal, such as teflon-on-teflon.\n\nMost dry materials in combination have friction coefficient values between 0.3 and 0.6. Values outside this range are rarer, but [[polytetrafluoroethylene|teflon]], for example, can have a coefficient as low as 0.04. A value of zero would mean no friction at all, an elusive property. Rubber in contact with other surfaces can yield friction coefficients from 1 to 2. Occasionally it is maintained that \u00b5 is always < 1, but this is not true. While in most relevant applications \u00b5 < 1, a value above 1 merely implies that the force required to slide an object along the surface is greater than the normal force of the surface on the object. For example, [[silicone rubber]] or [[acrylic rubber]]-coated surfaces have a coefficient of friction that can be substantially larger than 1.\n\nWhile it is often stated that the COF is a \"material property,\" it is better categorized as a \"system property.\" Unlike true material properties (such as conductivity, dielectric constant, yield strength), the COF for any two materials depends on system variables like [[temperature]], [[velocity]], [[atmosphere]] and also what are now popularly described as aging and deaging times; as well as on geometric properties of the interface between the materials, namely [[surface roughness|surface structure]].<ref name=\"statfric\" /> For example, a [[copper]] pin sliding against a thick copper plate can have a COF that varies from 0.6 at low speeds (metal sliding against metal) to below 0.2 at high speeds when the copper surface begins to melt due to frictional heating. The latter speed, of course, does not determine the COF uniquely; if the pin diameter is increased so that the frictional heating is removed rapidly, the temperature drops, the pin remains solid and the COF rises to that of a 'low speed' test.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n====Approximate coefficients of friction====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|Materials !! colspan=\"2\"|Static Friction, <math>\\mu_\\mathrm{s}\\,</math> !! colspan=\"2\"|Kinetic/Sliding Friction, <math>\\mu_\\mathrm{k}\\,</math>\n|-\n|-\n!

The friction increases as the applied force increases until the block moves.  After the block moves, it experiences kinetic friction, which is less than the maximum static friction.]]\n\nStatic friction is friction between two or more solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as ''\u03bc''<sub>s</sub>, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise as the result of surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as [[Asperity (materials science)|asperities]] are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for only a fraction of the apparent or nominal contact area. The linearity between applied load and true contact area, arising from asperity deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and normal force, found for typical Amonton-Coulomb type friction.<ref>{{cite journal | author= Greenwood J.A. and JB Williamson| title= Contact of nominally flat surfaces | journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | volume=295 | issue=1442 | year=1966}}</ref>\n\nThe static friction force must be overcome by an applied force before an object can move. The maximum possible friction force between two surfaces before sliding begins is the product of the coefficient of static friction and the normal force: <math>F_{max} = \\mu_\\mathrm{s} F_{n}\\,</math>. When there is no sliding occurring, the friction force can have any value from zero up to <math>F_{max}\\,</math>. Any force smaller than <math>F_{max}\\,</math> attempting to slide one surface over the other is opposed by a frictional force of equal magnitude and opposite direction.

Even though the wheel is in motion, the patch of the tire in contact with the ground is stationary relative to the ground, so it is static rather than kinetic friction. \n \nThe maximum value of static friction, when motion is impending, is sometimes referred to as '''limiting friction''',<ref name=\"Bhavikatti\">{{cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=4wkLl4NvmWAC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112\n| title = Engineering Mechanics\n| last = Bhavikatti\n| first = S.

Such reasoning aside, however, the approximation is fundamentally an empirical construct. It is a rule of thumb describing the approximate outcome of an extremely complicated physical interaction. The strength of the approximation is its simplicity and versatility. Though in general the relationship between normal force and frictional force is not exactly linear (and so the frictional force is not entirely independent of the contact area of the surfaces), the Coulomb approximation is an adequate representation of friction for the analysis of many physical systems.\n\nWhen the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, [[adhesive tape]] resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some [[drag racing]] tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\n====\"Negative\" coefficient of friction====\n{{As of|2012}}, a single study has demonstrated the potential for an ''effectively negative coefficient of friction in the low-load regime'', meaning that a decrease in normal force leads to an increase in friction. This contradicts everyday experience in which an increase in normal force leads to an increase in friction.<ref name=deng2012/>  This was reported in the journal ''Nature'' in October 2012 and involved the friction encountered by an atomic force microscope stylus when dragged across a graphene sheet in the presence of graphene-adsorbed oxygen.<ref name=deng2012>{{cite journal |last1=Deng |first1=Zhao |display-authors=etal |date=October 14, 2012 |title=Adhesion-dependent negative friction coefficient on chemically modified graphite at the nanoscale |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |bibcode=2012NatMa..11.1032D |doi=10.1038/nmat3452 |url=http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmat3452.html |accessdate=November 18, 2012 |laysummary=http://www.rdmag.com/news/2012/10/nanoscale-graphite-can-turn-friction-upside-down |laysource=R&D Magazine |laydate=October 17, 2012 |pmid=23064494 |volume=11 |pages=1032\u20137}}</ref>\n\n===Numerical simulation of the Coulomb model===\nDespite being a simplified model of friction, the Coulomb model is useful in many [[Computer simulation|numerical simulation]] applications such as [[multibody system]]s and [[granular material]].

This internal resistance to flow is named ''[[viscosity]]''. In everyday terms, the viscosity of a fluid is described as its \"thickness\". Thus, water is \"thin\", having a lower viscosity, while honey is \"thick\", having a higher viscosity. The less viscous the fluid, the greater its ease of deformation or movement.\n\nAll real fluids (except [[superfluid]]s) offer some resistance to shearing and therefore are viscous. For teaching and explanatory purposes it is helpful to use the concept of an inviscid fluid or an [[ideal fluid]] which offers no resistance to shearing and so is not viscous.\n\n==Lubricated friction==\n{{Main article|Lubrication}}\n\nLubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a fluid separates two solid surfaces. Lubrication is a technique employed to reduce wear of one or both surfaces in close proximity moving relative to each another by interposing a substance called a lubricant between the surfaces.\n\nIn most cases the applied load is carried by pressure generated within the fluid due to the frictional viscous resistance to motion of the lubricating fluid between the surfaces. Adequate lubrication allows smooth continuous operation of equipment, with only mild wear, and without excessive stresses or seizures at bearings. When lubrication breaks down, metal or other components can rub destructively over each other, causing heat and possibly damage or failure.\n\n==Skin friction==\n{{Main article|Parasitic drag}}\n\nSkin friction arises from the interaction between the fluid and the skin of the body, and is directly related to the area of the surface of the body that is in contact with the fluid. Skin friction follows the [[drag equation]] and rises with the square of the velocity.\n\nSkin friction is caused by viscous drag in the [[boundary layer]] around the object. There are two ways to decrease skin friction: the first is to shape the moving body so that smooth flow is possible, like an airfoil. The second method is to decrease the length and cross-section of the moving object as much as is practicable.\n\n==Internal friction==\n{{Main article|Plastic deformation of solids}}\n{{See also|Deformation (engineering)}}\nInternal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid material while it undergoes [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]].\n\n[[Deformation (engineering)#Plastic deformation|Plastic deformation]] in solids is an irreversible change in the internal molecular structure of an object. This change may be due to either (or both) an applied force or a change in temperature. The change of an object's shape is called strain. The force causing it is called [[stress (mechanics)|stress]].\n\n[[Elastic deformation]] in solids is reversible change in the internal molecular structure of an object. Stress does not necessarily cause permanent change. As deformation occurs, internal forces oppose the applied force. If the applied stress is not too large these opposing forces may completely resist the applied force, allowing the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original shape when the force is removed. This is known as elastic deformation or elasticity.\n\n==Radiation friction==\nAs a consequence of light pressure, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]<ref>{{cite book|last= Einstein, A.|title=On the development of our views concerning the nature and constitution of radiation. Translated in: The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, vol. 2 (Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1989)|date=1909|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=391}}</ref> in 1909 predicted the existence of \"radiation friction\" which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, \u201cradiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.\u201d\n\n==Other types of friction==\n\n===Rolling resistance===\n{{Main article|Rolling resistance}}\n\nRolling resistance is the force that resists the rolling of a wheel or other circular object along a surface caused by deformations in the object or surface. Generally the force of rolling resistance is less than that associated with kinetic friction.<ref>Silliman, Benjamin (1871) ''Principles of Physics, Or Natural Philosophy'', Ivison, Blakeman, Taylor & company publishers</ref> Typical values for the coefficient of rolling resistance are 0.001.<ref>Butt, Hans-J\u00fcrgen; Graf, Karlheinz and Kappl, Michael (2006) ''Physics and Chemistry of Interfaces'', Wiley, {{ISBN|3-527-40413-9}}</ref>\nOne of the most common examples of rolling resistance is the movement of [[motor vehicle]] tires on a [[road]], a process which generates heat and [[roadway noise|sound]] as by-products.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hogan |first1=C.

Braking friction differs from rolling friction because the coefficient of friction for rolling friction is small whereas the coefficient of friction for braking friction is designed to be large by choice of materials for [[brake pad]]s.\n\n===Triboelectric effect===\n{{Main article|Triboelectric effect}}\n\nRubbing dissimilar materials against one another can cause a build-up of [[electrostatic charge]], which can be hazardous if flammable gases or vapours are present. When the static build-up discharges, [[explosion]]s can be caused by ignition of the flammable mixture.\n\n===Belt friction===\n\n{{Main article|Belt friction}}\n\nBelt friction is a physical property observed from the forces acting on a belt wrapped around a pulley, when one end is being pulled. The resulting tension, which acts on both ends of the belt, can be modeled by the belt friction equation.\n\nIn practice, the theoretical tension acting on the belt or rope calculated by the belt friction equation can be compared to the maximum tension the belt can support. This helps a designer of such a rig to know how many times the belt or rope must be wrapped around the pulley to prevent it from slipping. Mountain climbers and sailing crews demonstrate a standard knowledge of belt friction when accomplishing basic tasks.\n\n==Reducing friction==\n\n===Devices===\nDevices such as wheels, [[ball bearing]]s, [[roller bearing]]s, and air cushion or other types of [[fluid bearing]]s can change sliding friction into a much smaller type of rolling friction.\n\nMany [[thermoplastic]] materials such as [[nylon]], [[HDPE]] and PTFE are commonly used in low friction [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. They are especially useful because the coefficient of friction falls with increasing imposed load.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} For improved wear resistance, very high [[molecular weight]] grades are usually specified for heavy duty or critical bearings.\n\n===Lubricants===\nA common way to reduce friction is by using a [[lubricant]], such as oil, water, or grease, which is placed between the two surfaces, often dramatically lessening the coefficient of friction. The science of friction and lubrication is called [[tribology]]. Lubricant technology is when lubricants are mixed with the application of science, especially to industrial or commercial objectives.\n\nSuperlubricity, a recently discovered effect, has been observed in [[graphite]]: it is the substantial decrease of friction between two sliding objects, approaching zero levels. A very small amount of frictional energy would still be dissipated.\n\nLubricants to overcome friction need not always be thin, turbulent fluids or powdery solids such as graphite and [[talc]]; [[acoustic lubrication]] actually uses sound as a lubricant.\n\nAnother way to reduce friction between two parts is to superimpose micro-scale vibration to one of the parts. This can be sinusoidal vibration as used in ultrasound-assisted cutting or vibration noise, known as [[dither]].\n\n==Energy of friction==\nAccording to the law of [[conservation of energy]], no energy is destroyed due to friction, though it may be lost to the system of concern. Energy is transformed from other forms into thermal energy. A sliding hockey puck comes to rest because friction converts its kinetic energy into heat which raises the thermal energy of the puck and the ice surface. Since heat quickly dissipates, many early philosophers, including [[Aristotle]], wrongly concluded that moving objects lose energy without a driving force.\n\nWhen an object is pushed along a surface along a path C, the energy converted to heat is given by a [[line integral]], in accordance with the definition of work\n   \n:<math>E_{th} = \\int_C \\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{fric}(\\mathbf{x}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{x}\\ = \\int_C \\mu_\\mathrm{k}\\ \\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{n}(\\mathbf{x}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{x}, </math>\nwhere\n: <math>\\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{fric}\\,</math> is the friction force,\n: <math>\\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{n}\\,</math> is the vector obtained by multiplying the magnitude of the normal force by a unit vector pointing ''against'' the object's motion,\n: <math>\\mu_\\mathrm{k}\\,</math> is the coefficient of kinetic friction, which is inside the integral because it may vary from location to location (e.g. if the material changes along the path),\n: <math>\\mathbf{x}\\,</math> is the position of the object.\n\nEnergy lost to a system as a result of friction is a classic example of thermodynamic [[irreversibility]].\n\n===Work of friction===\nIn the reference frame of the interface between two surfaces, static friction does ''no'' [[mechanical work|work]], because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does ''negative'' work.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Den Hartog |first=J. P. |title=Mechanics |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |page=142 |year=1961 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WRXrtu44W9UC |isbn=0-486-60754-2}}</ref> However, friction can do ''positive'' work in certain [[frames of reference]]. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box in the same direction that the box moves, doing ''positive'' work.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = Minds-on Physics \n| first = William J\n| last = Leonard\n| year = 2000\n| publisher = Kendall/Hunt\n| isbn = 0-7872-3932-1\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=t_AKvmza5s8C&pg=PA603\n| page = 603}}</ref>\n\nThe work done by friction can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in [[polishing]]. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials such as in the process of [[friction welding]]. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. [[hardness|Harder]] corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion ([[fretting]]) exacerbates wear of frictional forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, [[tolerance (engineering)|fit]] and [[Surface roughness|surface finish]] of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.<ref name=\"Bayer\">{{cite book |last=Bayer |first=Raymond George |title=Mechanical wear |publisher=CRC Press |year=2004 |pages=1, 2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q64Kq2HlyucC&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=Physical+wear+is+associated+with+friction |accessdate=2008-07-07 |isbn=0-8247-4620-1}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nFriction is an important factor in many [[engineering]] disciplines.\n\n===Transportation===\n*[[Vehicle brake|Automobile brakes]] inherently rely on friction, slowing a vehicle by converting its kinetic energy into heat. Incidentally, dispersing this large amount of heat safely is one technical challenge in designing brake systems. [[Disk brakes]] rely on friction between a disc and [[brake pads]] that are squeezed transversely against the rotating disc. In [[Drum brakes]], [[brake shoes]] or pads are pressed outwards against a rotating cylinder (brake drum) to create friction. Since braking discs can be more efficiently cooled than drums, disc brakes have better stopping performance.\n*[[Rail adhesion]] refers to the grip wheels of a train have on the rails, see [[Frictional contact mechanics]].\n*[[Road slipperiness]] is an important design and safety factor for automobiles<ref name=\"HighFrictionRoad\"> {{cite web |author=Iskander, R and Stevens, A | url=http://saferroadsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/R-Iskander-Effectiveness-of-the-Application-of-High-Friction-Surfacing-Crash-Reduction.pdf | title=Effectiveness of the Application of High Friction Surfacing-Crash-Reduction.pdf | work= | publisher= | date= | archive-url=http://saferroadsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/R-Iskander-Effectiveness-of-the-Application-of-High-Friction-Surfacing-Crash-Reduction.pdf |archive-date=2017-09-03 |access-date=2017-09-03 }}</ref>\n**[[Split friction]] is a particularly dangerous condition arising due to varying friction on either side of a car.\n**[[Texture (roads)|Road texture]] affects the interaction of tires and the driving surface.\n\n===Measurement===\n*A [[tribometer]] is an instrument that measures friction on a surface.\n*A [[profilograph]] is a device used to measure pavement surface roughness.\n\n===Household usage===\n*Friction is used to heat and ignite [[matchsticks]] (friction between the head of a matchstick and the rubbing surface of the match box).\n*[[Sticky pad|Sticky pads]] are used to prevent object from slipping off smooth surfaces by effectively increasing the friction coefficient between the surface and the object.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Contact dynamics]]\n*[[Contact mechanics]]\n*[[Factor of adhesion]]\n*[[Frictionless plane]]\n*[[Galling]]\n*[[Non-smooth mechanics]]\n*[[Normal contact stiffness]]\n*[[Stick-slip phenomenon]]\n*[[Transient friction loading]]\n*[[Triboelectric effect]]\n*[[Unilateral contact]]\n*[[Friction torque]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Friction |volume=11 |short=x}}\n*[http://www.roymech.co.uk/Useful_Tables/Tribology/co_of_frict.htm Coefficients of Friction] \u2013 tables of coefficients, plus many links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070601020244/http://www.physclips.unsw.edu.au/ Physclips: Mechanics with animations and video clips] from the University of New South Wales\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=WDll8hA006AC&pg=PT2503&lpg=PT2503 CRC Handbook of Chemistry & Physics \u2013 Values for Coefficient of Friction]\n*[http://chain-guide.com/basics/2-3-1-coefficient-of-friction.html Characteristic Phenomena in Conveyor Chain]\n*[http://nsfafresh.org Atomic-scale Friction Research and Education Synergy Hub (AFRESH)] an Engineering Virtual Organization for the atomic-scale friction community to share, archive, link, and discuss data, knowledge and tools related to atomic-scale friction.\n*[http://www.tribonet.org/wiki/friction-coefficients-in-atmosphere-and-vacuum/ Coefficients of friction of various material pairs in atmosphere and vacuum].\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Friction| ]]\n[[Category:Classical mechanics]]\n[[Category:Force]]\n[[Category:Tribology]]", "sha1": "iahj0x05cj5wq1o1e0z4gahhxnlvkaq"}}, {"title": "February 7", "ns": "0", "id": "11063", "revision": {"id": "865525931", "parentid": "865517443", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T13:22:20Z", "contributor": {"username": "Deb", "id": "1219"}, "comment": "Undid revision 865517443 by [[Special:Contributions/Blanche of King's Lynn|Blanche of King's Lynn]] ([[User talk:Blanche of King's Lynn|talk]]) - no new entries without references", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "\n{{pp-pc1}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}{{calendar}}\n{{This date in recent years}}\n{{Day}}\n\n==Events==\n* [[457]] &ndash; [[Leo I the Thracian]] becomes emperor of the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n* [[987]] &ndash; [[Bardas Phokas the Younger]] and [[Bardas Skleros]], Byzantine generals of the military elite, begin a [[Rebellion of Bardas Phokas the Younger|wide-scale rebellion]] against Emperor [[Basil II]].\n*[[1301]] &ndash; Edward of [[Caernarfon|Caernarvon]] (later king [[Edward II of England]]) becomes the first English [[Prince of Wales]].\n*[[1497]] &ndash; The [[Bonfire of the Vanities]] occurs, during which supporters of [[Girolamo Savonarola]] burn [[cosmetics]], art, and books in [[Florence]], Italy.\n*[[1783]] &ndash; [[American Revolutionary War]]: French and Spanish forces lift the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]].\n*[[1795]] &ndash; The [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|11th Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] is [[ratification|ratified]].\n*[[1807]] &ndash; [[Napoleonic Wars]]: Napoleon finds [[Levin August, Count von Bennigsen|Bennigsen's]] Russian forces taking a stand at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]].

Fowler#Stages of Faith}}\n\n[[James W. Fowler]] (1940\u20132015) proposes a series of stages of faith-development (or [[spiritual development]]) across the human life-span. His stages relate closely to the work of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], Erikson, and [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] regarding aspects of psychological development in children and adults. Fowler defines faith as an activity of trusting, committing, and relating to the world based on a set of assumptions of how one is related to others and the world.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Nancy|last1=Evans |first2=Deanna |last2=Forney |first3=Florence |last3=Guido |first4=Lori |last4=Patton |first5=Kristen |last5=Renn |title=Student Development in College: Theory, Research, and Practice |edition=Second |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=|year=2010 |isbn=978-0787978099}}</ref>\n\n=== Stages of faith ===\n# Intuitive-Projective: a stage of confusion and of high impressionability through stories and [[ritual]]s (pre-school period).\n# Mythic-Literal: a stage where provided information is accepted in order to conform with [[social norm]]s (school-going period).\n# Synthetic-Conventional: in this stage the faith acquired is concreted in the [[belief system]] with the forgoing of personification and replacement with [[authority]] in individuals or groups that represent one's beliefs (early-late adolescence).\n# Individuative-Reflective: in this stage the individual critically analyzes adopted and accepted faith with existing systems of faith. Disillusion or strengthening of faith happens in this stage. Based on needs, experiences and paradoxes (early adulthood).\n# Conjunctive faith: in this stage people realize the limits of [[logic]] and, facing the paradoxes or [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] of [[personal life|life]], accept the \"mystery of life\" and often return to the sacred stories and symbols of the pre-acquired or re-adopted faith system. This stage is called negotiated settling in life (mid-life).\n# Universalizing faith: this is the \"enlightenment\" stage where the individual comes out of all the existing systems of faith and lives life with universal principles of compassion and love and in service to others for upliftment, without worries and [[doubt]] (middle-late adulthood (45\u201365 years old and plus).<ref>Works of [[Daniel Levinson|Daniel J. Levinson]]</ref>{{full|date=May 2018}}\n\nNo hard-and-fast rule requires individuals pursuing faith to go through all six stages. There is a high probability for individuals to be content and fixed in a particular stage for a lifetime; stages from 2-5 are such stages. Stage 6 is the summit of faith development.

Om is considered to have a profound effect on the body and mind of the one who chants and also creates a calmness, serenity, healing, strength of its own to prevail within and also in the surrounding environment.\n\n=== Islam ===\n{{Main|Iman (concept)}}\nIn Islam, a believer's faith in the metaphysical aspects of [[Islam]] is called \"Iman\" ({{lang-ar|{{large|\u0627\u0644\u0625\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646}}}}), which is complete submission to the will of God, not unquestionable or blind belief.<ref>Far\u0101h\u012b, Majm\u016b\u2018ah Taf\u0101s\u012br, 2nd ed.

The ''faith in God'' is mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] Chapter 15 verse 6 and in the [[Book of Exodus]] Chapter 4 verse 31 and in the [[Book of Isaiah]], Chapter 43 verse 10, in the 24 books of the [[Jewish Bible]]. The word translated as \"faith\" here is the Hebrew word \u05d0\u05b8\u05de\u05b7\u05df which can also be translated \"believe\", \"reliable\", and \"trustworthy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/hebrew/539.htm|title=Strong's Hebrew: 539. \u05d0\u05b8\u05de\u05b7\u05df (aman) -- believe, reliable|work=biblehub.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> In the [[Book of Isaiah]], Chapter 43 verse 10, the commandment to know [[God in Judaism|God]] is followed by the commandments to believe and to understand, thus denoting descending importance.<ref name=beliefInGod>{{cite web|last=Mizrachi|first=Yosef|title=Who God Is|url=http://www.divineinformation.com/who-hashem-is/|work=Audios English 5min:40sec-9min:02sec|publisher=DivineInformation.com|accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Judaism does recognize the positive value of ''Emunah''<ref name=\"chabad\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1398519/jewish/Emunah.htm |title=What Is Emunah \u2013 Beyond Belief \u2013 Essentials |work=chabad.org |accessdate=14 October 2015}}</ref> (generally translated as faith, trust in God) and the negative status of the ''[[Epikoros|Apikorus]]'' (heretic), but faith is not as stressed or as central as it is in other religions, especially compared with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. It could be a necessary means for being a practicing religious Jew, but the emphasis is placed on true [[knowledge]], true [[Prophecy#Judaism|prophecy]] and practice rather than on faith itself. Very rarely does it relate to any teaching that must be believed.<ref name=beliefInGod /><ref name=Brueggemann2002 /> Judaism does not require one to explicitly identify God (a key tenet of [[Christian faith]], which is called [[Avodah Zarah]] in Judaism, a minor form of [[idolatry|idol worship]], a big sin and strictly forbidden to Jews). Rather, in Judaism, one is to honour a (personal) idea of God, supported by the many principles quoted in the Talmud to define Judaism, mostly by what it is not. Thus there is no established formulation of [[Jewish principles of faith]] which are mandatory for all (observant) [[Jews]].\n\nIn the Jewish scriptures trust in God \u2013 ''Emunah'' \u2013 refers to how God acts toward his people and how they are to respond to him; it is rooted in the everlasting covenant established in the [[Torah]], notably<ref name=Brueggemann2002>{{Cite book |last=Brueggemann |first=Walter |year=2002 |title=Reverberations of faith: a theological handbook of Old Testament themes |pages=76\u201378 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dBJQ71RIpdMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=faith+in+the+old+testament |isbn=0-664-22231-5 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Ky.}}</ref> Deuteronomy 7:9:\n\n{{Quote|text= Know, therefore, that the Lord, your God He is God, the faithful God, Who keeps the covenant and loving kindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations.<ref>(The [[Torah]] \u2013 A Modern Commentary; Union of American Hebrew Congregations, NY 1981 by W.

On a number of occasions, Abraham both accepts statements from God that seem impossible and offers obedient actions in response to direction from God to do things that seem implausible (see [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12-15).\n<blockquote>\"The [[Talmud]] describes how a thief also believes in G\u2011d: On the brink of his forced entry, as he is about to risk his life\u2014and the life of his victim\u2014he cries out with all sincerity, 'G\u2011d help me!'

For ''emunah'' to affect him in this way he needs study and contemplation.\"<ref name=\"chabad\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{Main|Sikhism|Five Ks}}\nFaith itself is not a religious concept in Sikhism. However, the five Sikh symbols, known as Kakaars or [[Five Ks]] (in Punjabi known as pa\u00f1j kakk\u0113 or pa\u00f1j kak\u0101r), are sometimes referred to as the ''Five articles of Faith''. The articles include ''[[Kesh (Sikhism)|k\u0113s]]'' (uncut hair), ''[[Kanga (Sikhism)|ka\u1e45gh\u0101]]'' (small wooden comb), ''[[Kara (Sikhism)|ka\u1e5b\u0101]]'' (circular steel or iron bracelet), ''[[kirpan|kirp\u0101n]]'' (sword/dagger), and ''[[kaccha|kacchera]]'' (special undergarment).

Fideism is not a synonym for religious belief, but describes a particular philosophical proposition in regard to the relationship between faith's appropriate jurisdiction at arriving at truths, contrasted against reason. It states that faith is needed to determine some philosophical and religious truths, and it questions the ability of reason to arrive at all truth. The word and concept had its origin in the mid- to late-19th century by way of [[Catholic]] thought, in a movement called [[Traditionalism (Catholicism)|Traditionalism]]. The Roman Catholic [[Magisterium]] has, however, repeatedly condemned [[fideism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/|title=Fideism|work=stanford.edu|accessdate=14 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Support ===\n[[Religious epistemology|Religious epistemologists]] have formulated and defended reasons for the rationality of accepting belief in God without the support of an argument.<ref name=InternetReligious>{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/relig-ep/ |title=Religious Epistemology |author=Clark, Kelly James |date=2 October 2004 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}</ref> Some religious epistemologists hold that belief in God is more analogous to belief in a person than belief in a scientific hypothesis.

This position is intended to resolve the [[Regress argument|infinite regress]] problem in [[epistemology]]. According to foundationalism, a belief is epistemically justified only if it is justified by properly basic beliefs. One of the significant developments in foundationalism is the rise of [[reformed epistemology]].<ref name=InternetFoundational />\n\nReformed epistemology is a view about the epistemology of religious belief, which holds that belief in God can be properly basic.

Different religious traditions make different religious claims, and Boghossian asserts that faith alone cannot resolve conflicts between these without evidence. He gives as an example of the belief held by that Muslims that [[Muhammad]] (who died in the year 632) was the last prophet, and the contradictory belief held by Mormons that [[Joseph Smith]] (born in 1805) was a prophet. Boghossian asserts that faith has no \"built-in corrective mechanism\". For factual claims, he gives the example of the belief that the Earth is 4,000 years old. With only faith and no reason or evidence, he argues, there is no way to correct this claim if it is inaccurate.

For example, a forest may be defined as any land that is used primarily for production of timber. Under such a land use definition, cleared roads or infrastructure within an area used for forestry, or areas within the region that have been cleared by harvesting, disease or fire are still considered forests even if they contain no trees. Land cover definitions define forests based upon the type and density of vegetation growing on the land. Such definitions typically define a forest as an area growing trees above some threshold. These thresholds are typically the number of trees per area (density), the area of ground under the [[tree canopy]] (canopy cover) or the section of land that is occupied by the cross-section of tree trunks (basal area).<ref name=\"ipcc\"/> Under such land cover definitions, and area of land only be defined as forest if it is growing trees. Areas that fail to meet the land cover definition may be still included under while immature trees are establishing if they are expected to meet the definition at maturity.<ref name=\"ipcc\"/>\n\nUnder land use definitions, there is considerable variation on where the cutoff points are between a forest, [[woodland]], and [[savanna]].

As a general rule, forests dominated by [[angiosperms]] (''broadleaf forests'') are more species-rich than those dominated by [[gymnosperms]] (''conifer'', ''montane'', or ''needleleaf forests''), although exceptions exist.\n\nForests sometimes contain many tree species within a small area (as in [[Tropical rainforest|tropical rain]] and [[temperate deciduous forest]]s), or relatively few species over large areas (e.g., [[taiga]] and arid [[montane]] coniferous forests). Forests are often home to many animal and plant species, and [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] per unit area is high compared to other vegetation communities.

The crowns of the dominant trees  receive most of the sunlight. This is the most productive part of the trees where maximum food is produced.

One such way is in terms of the [[biome]] in which they exist, combined with leaf longevity of the dominant species (whether they are [[evergreen]] or [[deciduous]]). Another distinction is whether the forests are composed predominantly of broadleaf trees, [[conifer]]ous (needle-leaved) trees, or mixed.\n* [[Boreal forest]]s occupy the [[subarctic]] zone and are generally evergreen and coniferous.\n* [[Temperate]] zones support both broadleaf deciduous forests (''e.g.'', [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate deciduous forest]]) and evergreen coniferous forests (''e.g.'', [[temperate coniferous forests]] and [[temperate rainforest]]s). Warm temperate zones support broadleaf evergreen forests, including [[laurel forest]]s.\n* Tropical and [[subtropical]] forests include [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical and subtropical moist forests]], [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical and subtropical dry forests]], and [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests]].\n* Physiognomy classifies forests based on their overall physical structure or [[Ecological succession|developmental]] stage (e.g. [[old growth]] vs. [[Secondary forest|second growth]]).\n* Forests can also be classified more specifically based on the climate and the dominant tree species present, resulting in numerous different forest types (e.g., [[Ponderosa pine]]/[[Douglas-fir]] forest).\n\nThe number of trees in the world, according to a 2015 estimate, is 3 trillion, of which 1.4 trillion are in the tropics or sub-tropics, 0.6 trillion in the temperate zones, and 0.7 trillion in the coniferous boreal forests. The estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates, and is based on tree densities [[Forest inventory|measured]] on over 400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin of error, not least because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Amos |first1=Jonathan |title=Earth's trees number 'three trillion' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34134366 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 September 2015 |date=3 September 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903082255/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34134366 |archivedate=3 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nForests can also be classified according to the amount of human alteration.

These 26 major types can be reclassified into 6 broader categories: temperate needleleaf; temperate broadleaf and mixed; tropical moist; tropical dry; sparse trees and parkland; and forest plantations.<ref name=wcmc/> Each category is described as a separate section below.\n\n====Temperate needleleaf====\n{{anchor|Coniferous forests}} \nTemperate needleleaf forests mostly occupy the higher latitude regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], as well as high altitude zones and some warm temperate areas, especially on nutrient-poor or otherwise unfavourable [[soils]]. These forests are composed entirely, or nearly so, of coniferous species ([[Coniferophyta]]). In the Northern Hemisphere pines ''[[Pinus]]'', spruces ''[[Picea]]'', larches ''[[Larix]]'', firs ''[[Abies]]'', Douglas firs ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'' and hemlocks ''[[Tsuga]]'', make up the canopy, but other taxa are also important. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], most coniferous trees (members of the [[Araucariaceae]] and [[Podocarpaceae]]) occur in mixtures with broadleaf species, and are classed as broadleaf and mixed forests.<ref name=wcmc/>\n\n====Temperate broadleaf and mixed====\n[[File:Namdapha2.jpg|thumb|upright|Broadleaf forest in [[Bhutan]]]]\n[[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]]s include a substantial component of trees in the [[Anthophyta]]. They are generally characteristic of the warmer temperate latitudes, but extend to cool temperate ones, particularly in the southern hemisphere. They include such forest types as the mixed deciduous forests of the United States and their counterparts in China and Japan, the broadleaf evergreen [[rainforest]]s of Japan, [[Chile]] and [[Tasmania]], the [[sclerophyllous]] forests of Australia, central Chile, the [[Mediterranean]] and California, and the southern beech [[Nothofagus]] forests of Chile and New Zealand.<ref name=wcmc/>\n\n====Tropical moist====\nThere are many different types of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forests]], with lowland evergreen broad leaf [[tropical rainforests]], for example [[V\u00e1rzea forest|v\u00e1rzea]] and [[Cant\u00e3o#Natural Communities|igap\u00f3 forest]]s and the terra firma forests of the [[Amazon Basin]]; the [[peat swamp forest]]s, [[dipterocarp]] forests of [[Southeast Asia]]; and the [[high forest (woodland)|high forests]] of the [[Congo Basin]].  [[Seasonal tropical forest]]s, perhaps the best description for the colloquial term \"[[jungle]]\", typically range from the rainforest zone 10 degrees north or south of the [[equator]], to the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. Forests located on mountains are also included in this category, divided largely into upper and lower [[Montane ecology|montane]] formations on the basis of the variation of physiognomy corresponding to changes in altitude.<ref>{{cite book|first1=S|last1=Chape|first2=M|last2=Spalding|first3=M|last3=Jenkins|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HuaGXdMTTmcC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=Tropical+moist+forests+include+many+different+forest+types#v=onepage&q=Tropical%20moist%20forests%20include%20many%20different%20forest%20types&f=false|title=The world's protected areas: status, values and prospects in the 21st century|publisher=Univ de Castilla La Mancha|year=2008|isbn=978-0520246607}}</ref>\n\n====Tropical dry====\n[[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|Tropical dry forests]] are characteristic of areas in the tropics affected by seasonal drought. The seasonality of rainfall is usually reflected in the deciduousness of the forest canopy, with most trees being leafless for several months of the year. However, under some conditions, e.g. less fertile soils or less predictable drought regimes, the proportion of evergreen species increases and the forests are characterised as \"[[sclerophyllous]]\". [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|Thorn forest]], a dense forest of low stature with a high frequency of thorny or spiny species, is found where drought is prolonged, and especially where grazing animals are plentiful. On very poor soils, and especially where fire or herbivory are recurrent phenomena, [[savanna]]s develop.<ref name=wcmc/>\n\n====Sparse trees and parkland====\n[[File:Urals forest.jpg|thumb|Taiga forest near [[Saranpaul]] in the northeast [[Ural Mountains]], [[Khanty\u2013Mansia]], Russia. Trees include ''[[Picea obovata]]'' (dominant on right bank), ''[[Larix sibirica]]'', ''[[Pinus sibirica]]'', and ''[[Betula pendula]]''.]]\nSparse trees and [[savanna]] are forests with lower [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] cover of trees. They occur principally in areas of transition from forested to non-forested landscapes. The two major zones in which these [[ecosystem]]s occur are in the [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] region and in the [[seasonally dry tropics]]. At high latitudes, north of the main zone of boreal forest, growing conditions are not adequate to maintain a continuous closed [[forest cover]], so tree cover is both sparse and discontinuous. This vegetation is variously called open [[taiga]], open [[lichen]] woodland, and forest tundra. A savanna is a mixed [[woodland]] [[grassland]] [[ecosystem]] characterized by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken [[herbaceous]] layer consisting primarily of grasses. Savannas maintain an open canopy despite a high tree density.<ref name=wcmc/>\n\n====Forest plantations====\nForest plantations are generally intended for the production of timber and [[pulpwood]]. Commonly mono-specific and/or composed of introduced tree species, these [[ecosystems]] are not generally important as habitat for native [[biodiversity]]. However, they can be managed in ways that enhance their biodiversity protection functions and they can provide ecosystem services such as maintaining nutrient capital, protecting [[Drainage basin|watershed]]s and soil structure, and storing carbon.<ref name=Chazdon/><ref name=wcmc/>\n\n==Societal significance==\n{{main|Forestry|Logging|Deforestation}}\n[[File:Redwood M D Vaden.jpg|thumb|Redwood tree in northern California redwood forest, where many [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] trees are managed for preservation and longevity, rather than being harvested for wood production]]\n\nForests provide a diversity of [[ecosystem services]] including:\n\n* converting carbon dioxide into oxygen and biomass.\n* acting as a [[carbon sink]].

[[Forest management]] has changed considerably over the last few centuries, with rapid changes from the 1980s onwards culminating in a practice now referred to as [[sustainable forest management]]. Forest ecologists concentrate on forest patterns and processes, usually with the aim of elucidating cause-and-effect relationships. [[Forester]]s who practice [[sustainable forest management]] focus on the integration of ecological, social, and economic values, often in [[Stakeholder engagement|consultation with local communities and other stakeholders]].\n[[File:Checkerboard forest in Idaho.jpg|alt=Priest River winds through mountains with a checkerboard design of trees to its east|thumb|[[Priest River (Idaho)|Priest River]] winding through Whitetail Butte with lots of forestry to the east\u2014these lot patterns have existed since the mid-19th century.

Anthropogenic factors that can affect forests include logging, [[urban sprawl]], human-caused [[forest fire]]s, [[acid rain]], [[invasive species]], and the [[slash and burn]] practices of swidden agriculture or [[shifting cultivation]]. The loss and re-growth of forest leads to a distinction between two broad types of forest, primary or [[old-growth forest]] and [[secondary forest]]. There are also many natural factors that can cause changes in forests over time including [[forest fires]], [[Forest pathology#Animals|insect]]s, [[Forest pathology|diseases]], weather, competition between species, etc. In 1997, the [[World Resources Institute]] recorded that only 20% of the world's original forests remained in large intact tracts of undisturbed forest.<ref>World Resources Institute (1997).

The study covered 233 countries and areas. Brazil and Indonesia, which had the highest loss of forests in the 1990s, have significantly reduced their deforestation rates.

Latvia's forests have been steadily increasing over the years which is in contrast to many other nations, mostly due to the forestation of land not used for agriculture. In 1935 there was only 1,757,000 hectares of forest, today this has increased by more than 150%. Birch is the most common tree at 28.2% followed by pine (26,9%), spruce (18.3%), grey alder (9.7%), aspen (8,0%), black alder (5.7%), oak/ash (1.2%) and finally hardwood making up the rest (2.0%).<ref>{{cite web|title=Forestry in 2015 (only in Latvian) {{!}} Latvijas statistika|url=http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/dati/e-publikacijas/forestry-2015-only-latvian-45361.html|website=www.csb.gov.lv|accessdate=21 December 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222053718/http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/dati/e-publikacijas/forestry-2015-only-latvian-45361.html|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Buklets \"Me\u017ea nozare Latvij\u0101\"|url=https://www.zm.gov.lv/mezi/statiskas-lapas/nozares-informacija/publikacijas/buklets-meza-nozare-latvija-?nid=1088#jump|website=www.zm.gov.lv|accessdate=21 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222053235/https://www.zm.gov.lv/mezi/statiskas-lapas/nozares-informacija/publikacijas/buklets-meza-nozare-latvija-?nid=1088#jump|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Gauja National Park Latvia.jpg|thumb|[[Gauja National Park]], [[Latvia]]]]\n\n===United States===\n\nIn the United States, most forests have historically been affected by humans to some degree, though in recent years improved forestry practices have helped regulate or moderate large scale or severe impacts.

[[Lake Ontario]] is at top, Oneida Lake upper right, Cazenovia Lake directly below Oneida.]]\n{{Regions of New York}}\n}}\nThe '''Finger Lakes''' are a group of 11 long, narrow, roughly north\u2013south [[lakes]] in an area called the Finger Lakes region in [[Central New York]], in the [[United States]]. It is defined as a [[bioregion]] and is a popular tourist destination.\n\nThe lakes' shapes reminded early map-makers of human fingers, and the name stuck. They are also characteristic glacial [[finger lake]]s. [[Cayuga Lake|Cayuga]] (435 feet deep, 133 m) and [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca]] (618 feet, 188 m) Lakes are among the deepest in the United States, with bottoms well below sea level.  They are also the longest Finger Lakes, though neither's width exceeds 3.5 miles (5.6&nbsp;km); Seneca Lake is {{convert|38.1|mi|km}} long, and {{convert|66.9|mi2|km2}}, the largest in total area.\n\n== Lakes ==\n[[File:Fingerlakesmap.png|thumb|248px|Map of the Finger Lakes]]\nThe 11 Finger Lakes, from east to west, are: \n* [[Otisco Lake]]\n* [[Skaneateles Lake]]\n* [[Owasco Lake]]\n* [[Cayuga Lake]]\n* [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]]\n* [[Keuka Lake]]\n* [[Canandaigua Lake]]\n* [[Honeoye Lake]]\n* [[Canadice Lake]]\n* [[Hemlock Lake]]\n* [[Conesus Lake]]\n\n[[Cazenovia Lake]] to the east, although smaller, is sometimes called \"the 12th Finger Lake\", because it is similar in shape. It is in Appalachian hill terrain, with a historic village linked to other Finger Lakes by [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US 20]]. It may have been formed in the same manner as the Finger Lakes, as satellite photos show three valleys similar in character and spacing to the Finger Lakes east of Otisco Lake. The first is the [[Tully, New York|Tully]] Valley, which includes a chain of small lakes at the south end that could be a \"Finger Lake\" that never formed because of a [[terminal moraine]]. The moraine caused the [[Tioughnioga River]] to flow south instead of north, the opposite of the Finger Lakes' waters. The next two valleys to the east contain Butternut Creek, which flows north, and the East Branch of the Tioughnioga River, which flows south. The next valley contains Limestone Creek, which flows north. The next valley after that contains Cazenovia Lake.\n\n[[File:Overview of the Great Lakes from orbit.jpg|thumb|left|The Finger Lakes are in the center bottom of this west facing image; [[Lake Erie]] (upper left), [[Lake Huron]] (upper right), and [[Lake Ontario]] (lower right) are three of the [[Great Lakes]]]]\n[[Oneida Lake]], to the northeast of [[Syracuse, New York]], is sometimes included as the \"thumb\", although it is shallow and somewhat different in character from the rest. [[Onondaga Lake]], though just north of the Finger Lakes region, is not considered one of the Finger Lakes. As with Oneida and Cazenovia Lakes, it drains into Lake Ontario and the [[St. Lawrence River]]. Likewise, [[Chautauqua Lake]], [[Findley Lake, New York|Findley Lake]] and [[Allegheny Reservoir|Kinzua Lake]] to the west are not considered Finger Lakes; all three drain into the [[Allegheny River]] and eventually into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and in the case of Kinzua and Findley, the lakes are the [[Kinzua Dam|artificial creation of dams]].\n\nConesus, Hemlock, Canadice, Honeoye, and Otisco are considered the minor Finger Lakes. Other, smaller lakes, including [[Silver_Lake_(Wyoming_County,_New_York)|Silver]], [[Waneta Lake|Waneta]], and [[Lamoka Lake|Lamoka]] lakes, dot this region. [[Silver_Lake_(Wyoming_County,_New_York)|Silver Lake]], west of Conesus Lake, would seem to qualify because it is in the Great Lakes watershed, but Waneta and Lamoka lakes are part of the [[Susquehanna River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]] as they drain into a tributary of the [[Chemung River]].\n\nEast of Oneida and Cazenovia Lakes are the [[headwaters]] of the [[Susquehanna River]] and [[Hudson River]] watersheds (the former in the foothills of the Catskills, the latter through the [[Mohawk Valley]] and southern [[Adirondack Mountains]]).\n\nThe {{convert|2,000|acre|km2|adj=on|sigfig=1}} [[muckland]] of a valley in [[Potter, New York]], which is part of [[Torrey Farms]], was almost a 12th Finger Lake, as the waterline is just below the surface. It lies between Lakes Canandaigua and Seneca, and was once a swamp.\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:S. Main Bench.jpg|thumb|225px|right|225px|Seneca Lake, from South Main Street in [[Geneva, New York]].]]\nThese glacial [[finger lake]]s originated as a series of northward-flowing streams. Around two million years ago, the first of many continental glaciers of the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] moved southward from the [[Hudson Bay]] area, initiating the [[Pleistocene glaciation]]. These scouring glaciers widened, deepened, and accentuated the existing river valleys. Glacial debris, possibly [[terminal moraine]] left behind by the receding ice, acted as dams, allowing lakes to form.  Despite the deep erosion of the valleys, the surrounding uplands show little evidence of glaciation, suggesting the ice was thin, or at least unable to cause much erosion at these higher altitudes. The deep cutting by the ice left some [[Valley#Hanging valleys|tributaries hanging]] high above the lakes\u2014both Seneca and Cayuga have tributaries hanging as much as 120 m above the valley floors.<ref name=\"MullinsOthers1996a\">Mullins, H.T. and Eyles, N. eds., 1996.

Due to the recent increase in [[fracking]] technology, the [[natural gas]] is now available to extraction. While some large landowners have leased their lands, and a number of small landowners would like to follow suit, many residents of the Finger Lakes oppose the process of extraction due to concerns about groundwater contamination and the industrial impact of the extraction related activities. The first [[direct actions]] and local legislative actions against fracking occurred in the Finger Lakes [[bioregion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2015/01/09/new-york-fracking-history/21534581/|title=How fracking got stopped in NY|publisher=}}</ref> In December 2014, the government of New York banned all fracking within the state, citing pollution risks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/nyregion/cuomo-to-ban-fracking-in-new-york-state-citing-health-risks.html|title=Citing Health Risks, Cuomo Bans Fracking in New York State|first=Thomas|last=Kaplan|date=17 December 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Bluffpoint.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Bluff Point on Keuka Lake]]\n[[File:Granger Homestead.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Granger Homestead, [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]]]]\n\nThe Finger Lakes region contains evidence of pre-[[Iroquois]] habitation, such as [[The Bluff Point Stoneworks]], but little is known about who may have constructed these enigmatic works.\n\nThe Finger Lakes region is a central part of the [[Iroquois]] homeland. The Iroquois tribes include the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] and [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] nations, for which the two largest Finger Lakes are named. The [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] tribe lived in the Finger Lakes region as well, from ca. 1720. The [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] and [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] tribes lived at the eastern edge of the region, closer to their namesake lakes, [[Oneida Lake]] and [[Onondaga Lake]]. The easternmost Iroquois tribe was the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]].\n\nDuring colonial times, many other tribes moved to the Finger Lakes region, seeking the protection of the Iroquois. For example, in 1753 remnants of several Virginia [[Sioux|Siouan]] tribes, collectively called the [[Tutelo]]-[[Saponi]], moved to the town of Coreorgonel at the south end of Cayuga Lake near present-day Ithaca, until 1779 when their village was destroyed.\n\nMajor Iroquois towns in the Finger Lakes region included the Seneca town of [[Geneseo (town), New York|Gen-nis-he-yo]] (present-day Geneseo), [[Kanadaseaga]] (Seneca Castle, near present-day Geneva), [[Goiogouen]] (Cayuga Castle, east of Cayuga Lake), [[Chonodote]] (Cayuga town, present-day Aurora), [[Catherine's Town (Seneca town)|Catherine's Town]] (near present-day [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins Glen]]) and [[Ganondagan State Historic Site]] in [[Victor, New York]].\n\nAs one of the most powerful Indian nations during colonial times, the Iroquois were able to prevent European colonization of the Finger Lakes region for nearly two centuries after first contact, often playing the French off against the British interests in savvy demonstrations of political competence. Tribal politics and the military reality that the Iroquois held the strongest military force in North America were well appreciated. By the late 18th century with the French governmental influence gone from Canada Iroquois power had weakened, relative to the steady growth in European-Americans' populations, and internal strife eroded the political unity of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] as they faced pressures from colonists itching to move west and a desire to keep them out of Amerindian lands. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], some Iroquois sided with the British and some with the Americans, resulting in civil war among the Iroquois. In the late 1770s, British-allied Iroquois attacked various American frontier settlements, prompting counter-attacks, culminating in the [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1779, which destroyed most of the Iroquois towns and effectively broke Iroquois power. After the Revolutionary War, the Iroquois and other Indians of the region were assigned reservations. Most of their land, including the Finger Lakes region, was opened up to purchase and settlement.\n\nRoughly the western half of the Finger Lakes region comprised the [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase]] of 1790. The region was rapidly settled at the turn of the 19th century, largely by a westward migration from [[New England]], and to a lesser degree by northward influx from Pennsylvania.  The regional architecture reflects these area traditions of the Federal and [[Greek Revival]] periods.\n\n==Notable places==\n\n[[File:Canadice Lake in the Finger Lakes.jpg|225px|left|thumb|Canadice Lake is surrounded by the Hemlock-Canadice State Forest]]\n\nThe Finger Lakes region, together with the [[Genesee Country]] of Western New York, has been referred to as the [[burned-over district]].<ref>{{citation |first1= Glenn C. |last1= Altschuler |first2= Jan M. |last2= Saltzgaber |url= http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.cdl/docviewer?did=cdl166 |title= Revivalism, Social Conscience, and Community in the Bured-over District: the Trial of Rhoda Bement |publisher= Cornell University Press |place= Ithaca, NY |year= 1983 |isbn= 0801415411 |lccn= 82014296 |oclc= 8805286 }}</ref> There, in the 19th century, the [[Second Great Awakening]] was a revival of [[Christianity]]; some new [[religion]]s were also formed.\n\nThe region was active in reform and utopian movements.  Many of its [[Underground Railroad]] sites have been documented.  For example, the [[Harriet Tubman]] Home at [[Auburn, NY|Auburn]] recalls the life and work of the African-American  \"Moses of her people.\"\n\nOn the northern end of the Finger Lakes are also [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], the birthplace of the [[Women's suffrage]] movement; [[Waterloo (village), New York|Waterloo]], the birthplace of [[Memorial Day]]; and [[Palmyra (village), New York|Palmyra]], the birthplace of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).  An annual outdoor drama, The ''Hill [[Cumorah]] Pageant'', produced by the LDS Church, draws thousands of visitors each year.\n\n[[Hammondsport, New York|Hammondsport]] was the home of aviation pioneer [[Glenn Curtiss]], and favorable air currents make the area a popular spot for [[Glider aircraft|glider]] pilots. [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]], just to the south, was the home of [[Mark Twain]] in his later life, and the site of an infamous [[American Civil War|Civil War]] prison. [[Corning (city), New York|Corning]] is most noted as the home of [[Corning Glass Works]] and the [[Corning Museum of Glass]]. [[Hornell, New York|Hornell]], just southwest of the Finger Lakes, was a major [[railroad]] center; [[locomotive]]s were repaired there until recently. [[Conesus, New York|Conesus]] remains the home of the oldest producer of pure grape [[sacramental wine]] in the Western hemisphere.\n\n[[File:Finger Lakes Hemlock Lake.jpg|thumb|225px|Hemlock Lake, one of the western Finger Lakes]]\nNotable among the historic buildings of the region (most linked below) is the [[Granger Homestead]] (1816), a large village house in [[Federal Style]] at Canandaigua, New York.  Another example of the Federal Style is the Prouty-Chew House (1829) at Geneva, portions of which were altered at various times in new fashions.\n\nThree [[Greek Revival]] mansions are situated near three lakes:  The Richard DeZeng House, Skaneateles (1839); Rose Hill, Geneva (1839); and Esperanza, Penn Yan (1838).  The latter two are open to the public.\n\nThe Seward House in Auburn, a [[National Historic Landmark]], is a mansion more characteristic of the Civil War era, virtually unchanged from the nineteenth century. [[Belhurst Castle]], Geneva, a stone mansion in the Romanesque Revival style, now serves as an inn. [[Sonnenberg Gardens and Mansion State Historic Park|Sonnenberg]] mansion at Canandaigua is later nineteenth-century residence in the Queen Anne style, known for its restored period gardens. [[Geneva on the Lake]] is a villa (1910\u201314) that recalls those on Italian lakes.  Now an inn, it has European-style gardens. Many buildings and historic districts of the Finger Lakes region are notable, other than these historic houses.\n\nImplemented in August 2010, the Hemlock-Canadice State Forest covers {{convert|6,684|acre|km2}} that encompass the two western Finger Lakes, [[Hemlock Lake|Hemlock]] and [[Canadice Lake|Canadice]]. These lakes have provided drinking water for the City of Rochester for more than 100 years. To protect water quality, the city acquired much of the property around the lakes. Over the decades, the land reforested, but a few traces of its past, such as stone walls or cottage foundations, remain. Today these two lakes, with their steep, forested, largely undeveloped shorelines and deep clear water, provide visitors a glimpse of the Finger Lakes of the past. The Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) manages this State Forest for compatible public access for recreation, including [[New York State Wildlife Management Areas|fishing, hunting]], nature study, boating and [[Finger Lakes Trail|hiking]]. Activities in Hemlock-Canadice State Forest are subject the DEC\u2019s Rules and Regulations for the Use of State Lands, 6 NYCRR Part 190, as well as any other applicable state statutes, rules and regulations. These are sensitive areas because they protect public drinking water.\n\nHemlock Lake is home to the state's oldest nesting [[bald eagle]] site, dating back to the early 1960s.  The nesting bald eagles of Hemlock Lake have fostered a resurgence of bald eagles throughout New York State.  Hemlock Lake, originally known as \"O-Neh-Da\" which is Seneca for \"Lake of Hemlock Trees\", is home to the nation's oldest [[sacramental wine]]ry, founded by Bishop McQuaid in 1872.  Today, O-Neh-Da Vineyard continues to make premium natural pure grape wine for churches and foodies alike.\n\n=== Wine ===\n{{Main article|Finger Lakes AVA}}\n[[File:Sunrise overlooking a vineyard in the Finger Lakes.jpg|thumb|Sunrise overlooking a vineyard on Canandaigua Lake]]\n\nThe Finger Lakes area is New York's largest [[wine]] producing region. Over 100 [[wineries]] and [[vineyards]] are around Seneca, Cayuga, Canandaigua, Keuka, Conesus, and Hemlock Lakes. Because of the lakes' great depth, they provide a lake effect to the lush vineyards that flank their shores. Retaining residual summer warmth in the winter, and winter's cold in the spring, the grapes are protected from disastrous spring frost during shoot growth, and early frost before the harvest. The main grape varieties grown are [[Chardonnay]], [[Riesling]], [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]], [[Pinot noir]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Vidal blanc]], [[Seyval blanc]] and many ''[[Vitis labrusca]]'' (American native) varieties or cultivars.\n\nWith the passage of the [[New York Farm Winery Act of 1976|Farm Winery Act in 1976]], numerous wineries are now open to visitors. Wineries are a growth industry of the region, contributing through their production and by attracting visitors.\n\nThe Finger Lakes American Viticulture Area (AVA) includes two of America's oldest wineries, O-Neh-Da Vineyard (1872) on Hemlock Lake and The Pleasant Valley Wine Company (1860) on Keuka Lake.\n\n=== Educational institutions ===\n[[File:WellsCollegeTower600R.jpg|right|175px|thumb| [[Wells College]], [[Aurora, Cayuga County, New York|Aurora]]]]\n\nThe area is also known for education; the largest institution is [[Cornell University]] in Ithaca. Other notable schools are [[Ithaca College]], also in Ithaca; the [[University of Rochester]], [[Nazareth College (New York)|Nazareth College]], [[St. John Fisher College]] and [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] in Rochester; [[Elmira College]] in Elmira; [[Corning Community College]] in Corning; [[Tompkins Cortland Community College]] in Dryden, Ithaca, and Cortland; [[Wells College]] in Aurora; [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]] in Geneva; [[Keuka College]] in [[Keuka Park, New York|Keuka Park]]; [[Finger Lakes Community College]] in [[Canandaigua]] and Geneva; and [[The State University of New York at Cortland]] in [[Cortland, New York|Cortland]]; [[New York Chiropractic College]] in [[Seneca Falls, New York|Seneca Falls]]; [[Cayuga Community College]] in Auburn; and The [[State University of New York at Geneseo]] in [[Geneseo, New York|Geneseo]].\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe Finger Lakes region is home to several museums. These include the [[Corning Museum of Glass]], the [[Johnson Museum of Art]] at [[Cornell University]], the [[Strong National Museum of Play]], the [[Glenn H. Curtiss Museum]], the [http://www.flbm.org Finger Lakes Boating Museum], the [[Wings of Eagles Discovery Center]], the [[Sciencenter]], the [[Museum of the Earth]], the [[National Soaring Museum]], the [[Rockwell Museum]], the Seward House Museum, the [[William H. Seward]] and the Samuel Warren Homesteads of the York Historical Society, birthplace of New York State's first successful commercial winery.\n\nThe Women's Rights National Historic Park is in Seneca Falls. The park includes the home of [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and the Wesleyan Chapel, where she held the first convention on women's rights in 1848.\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* Thompson, John H., ed.

The Rogallo wing was adapted for [[stunt kite]]s and [[hang gliding]] and the parafoil was adapted for [[parachuting]] and [[paragliding]]. \n\nThe rapid development of mechanically powered aircraft diminished interest in kites. [[World War II]] saw a limited use of kites for military purposes ([[survival radio]], [[Focke Achgelis Fa 330]], [[military radio antenna kites]]). \n\nKites are now mostly used for recreation. Lightweight synthetic materials ([[ripstop nylon]], [[plastic film]], [[carbon fiber]] tube and rod) are used for kite making. Synthetic rope and cord ([[nylon]], [[polyethylene]], [[kevlar]] and [[dyneema]]) are used as bridle and kite line.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Sparless Styrofoam kite in flight.jpg|thumb|Sparless [[styrofoam]] kites]]\n\nDesigns often emulate flying insects, birds, and other beasts, both real and mythical. The finest Chinese kites are made from split bamboo (usually golden bamboo), covered with silk, and hand painted. On larger kites, clever hinges and latches allow the kite to be disassembled and compactly folded for storage or transport. Cheaper mass-produced kites are often made from printed [[polyester]] rather than silk.\n\nTails are used for some [[Inflatable single-line kite|single-line kite]] designs to keep the kite's nose pointing into the wind. Spinners and spinsocks can be attached to the flying line for visual effect. There are rotating wind socks which spin like a [[turbine]]. On large display kites these tails, spinners and spinsocks can be {{convert|50|feet|m|0}} long or more.\n\nModern aerobatic kites use two or four lines to allow fine control of the kite's angle to the wind. Traction kites may have an additional line to de-power the kite and quick-release mechanisms to disengage flyer and kite in an emergency.\n\n==Practical uses==\n{{Main|Kite applications}}\n\nKites have been used for human flight, military applications, science and meteorology, photography, lifting radio antennas, generating power, aerodynamics experiments, and much more.\n\n===Military applications===\nKites have been used for [[military]] purposes in the past, such as  signaling, delivery of [[munition]]s, and for [[observation]], both by lifting an observer above the field of battle and by using [[kite aerial photography]].\n\nKites were first used in warfare by the Chinese.<ref name=\"Murphy\">[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=jFMQBAAAQBAJ&pg=PP7&dq=kite+gunpowder&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFqL_W2ubaAhUOzKQKHfUHBXEQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=kite%20gunpowder&f=false Military Aircraft, Origins to 1918: An Illustrated History of Their Impact], Justin D.

Kites were the precursors to the traditional [[aircraft]], and were instrumental in the development of early flying craft. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] experimented with very large [[man-lifting kite]]s, as did the [[Wright brothers]] and [[Lawrence Hargrave]]. Kites had a historical role in lifting scientific instruments to measure atmospheric conditions for [[weather forecasting]]. [[Francis Ronalds]] and [[William Radcliffe Birt]] described a very stable kite at [[King's Observatory|Kew Observatory]] as early as 1847 that was trialled for the purpose of supporting self-registering meteorological instruments at height.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Radio aerials and light beacons===\nKites can be used for radio purposes, by kites carrying antennas for [[Medium frequency|MF]], [[Low frequency|LF]] or [[VLF]]-transmitters. This method was used for the reception station of the first transatlantic transmission by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]]. [[moored balloon|Captive balloons]] may be more convenient for such experiments, because kite-carried antennas require a lot of wind, which may be not always possible with heavy equipment and a ground conductor. It must be taken into account during experiments, that a conductor carried by a kite can lead to high voltage toward ground, which can endanger people and equipment, if suitable precautions (grounding through resistors or a [[Resonant circuit|parallel resonant circuit]] tuned to transmission frequency) are not taken.\n\nKites can be used to carry light effects such as lightsticks or battery powered lights.\n\n===Kite traction===\n[[File:Kite333.JPG|thumb|A quad-line traction kite, commonly used as a power source for [[kite surfing]]]]\n\nKites can be used to pull people and vehicles downwind. Efficient [[Foil kite|foil-type kites]] such as [[power kite]]s can also be used to sail upwind under the same principles as used by other sailing craft, provided that lateral forces on the ground or in the water are redirected as with the keels, center boards, wheels and ice blades of traditional sailing craft. In the last two decades several kite sailing sports have become popular, such as kite buggying, kite landboarding, [[kiteboating|kite boating]] and kite surfing. Snow kiting has also become popular in recent years.\n\nKite sailing opens several possibilities not available in traditional sailing:\n\n* Wind speeds are greater at higher altitudes\n* Kites may be manoeuvered dynamically which increases the force available dramatically\n* There is no need for mechanical structures to withstand bending forces; vehicles or hulls can be very light or dispensed with all together\n\n===Underwater kites===\n[[Tidal stream generator|Underwater kites]] are being developed to harvest renewable power from the flow of water.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/20/wales-launches-25m-underwater-kite-turbine-scheme Wales launches \u00a325m underwater kite-turbine scheme] The Guardian (retrieved 17 November 2015)</ref><ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/underwater-kites-can-harness-ocean-currents-to-create-clean-energy-180947694/?no-ist Underwater Kites Can Harness Ocean Currents to Create Clean Energy] Smithsonian.com (retrieved 17 November 2015)</ref>\n\n== Cultural uses ==\n[[List of kite festivals|Kite festivals]] are a popular form of entertainment throughout the world.

Tails are not used on fighter kites so that agility and maneuverability are not compromised.\n\nIn [[Afghanistan]], kite flying is a popular game, and is known in [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]] as ''Gudiparan Bazi''. Some kite fighters pass their strings through a mixture of ground glass powder and glue, which is legal. The resulting strings are very abrasive and can sever the competitor's strings more easily. The abrasive strings can also injure people. During the [[Taliban]] rule in Afghanistan, kite flying was banned, among various other recreations.\n\nIn [[Pakistan]], kite flying is often known as Gudi-Bazi or Patang-bazi. Although kite flying is a popular ritual for the celebration of spring festival known as  [[Jashn-e-Baharaan]] (lit. Spring Festival) or [[Basant (season)|Basant]], kites are flown throughout the year. [[Fighter kite|Kite fighting]] is a very popular pastime all around Pakistan, but mostly in urban centers across the country (especially [[Lahore]]).  The kite fights are at their highest during the spring celebrations and the fighters enjoy competing with rivals to cut-loose the string of the others kite, this is popularly known as \"Paecha\". During the spring festival, kite flying competitions are held across the country and the skies are colored with kites. As people cut-loose an opponents kite, shouts of 'wo kata' ring through the air. They reclaim the kites, after they have been cut-loose, by running after them. This is a popular ritual especially among the youth (similar to scenes depicted in the Kite Runner which is based in neighboring Afghanistan).  Kites and strings are a big business in the country and many types of strings are used: glass-coated strings, metal strings and tandi. However, kite flying was recently banned in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] due to recent motorcyclist deaths caused by glass-coated or metal kite-strings.  Kup, Patang, Guda, and Nakhlaoo are some of the kites used. They vary in balance, weight and speed.\n\nIn [[Indonesia]] kites is flown as both sport and recreation. One of the most popular kites variants is from [[Bali]]. Balinese kites are unique and they has different design and forms; birds, butterflies, dragons, ships, etc. In [[Vietnam]], kites are flown without tails. Instead small flutes are attached allowing the wind to \"hum\" a musical tune. There are other forms of sound-making kites. In Bali, large bows are attached to the front of the kites to make a deep throbbing vibration, and in Malaysia row of gourds with sound-slots are used to create a whistle as the kite flies. Malaysia has also the [[Kite Museum (Malacca)|Kite Museum]] in [[Malacca]].<ref>Pogadaev, Victor. Svetly Mesyatz-Zmei Kruzhitsa (My Lord Moon Kite) - \"Vostochnaya Kollektsia\" (Oriental Collection).

Highly maneuverable single-string paper and bamboo kites are flown from the rooftops while using line friction in an attempt to cut each other's kite lines, either by letting the cutting line loose at high speed or by pulling the line in a fast and repeated manner. During the Indian spring festival of [[Makar Sankranti]], near the middle of January, millions of people fly kites all over northern India.  Kite flying in Hyderabad starts a month before this, but kite flying/fighting is an important part of other celebrations, including [[Republic Day]], Independence Day, [[Raksha Bandhan]], [[Vishvakarman#Vishwakarma Puja|Viswakarma Puja day]] in late September and [[Janmashtami]]. An international kite festival is held every year before [[Uttarayan]] for three days in [[Vadodara]], [[Surat]] and [[Ahmedabad]].\n\nKites have been flown in China since ancient times.

There are kite festival in parks and beache mostly on August. \n\nIn [[Colombia]], kites can be seen flown in parks and recreation areas during August which is known to be windy. It is during this month that most people, especially the young ones would fly kites.\n\nIn [[Guyana]], kites are flown at Easter, an activity in which all ethnic and religious groups participate. Kites are generally not flown at any other time of year. Kites start appearing in the sky in the weeks leading up to Easter and school children are taken to parks for the activity. It all culminates in a massive airborne celebration on Easter Monday especially in Georgetown, the capital, and other coastal areas. The history of the practice is not entirely clear but given that Easter is a Christian festival, it is said that kite flying is symbolic of the Risen Lord. Moore<ref>Moore, Brian L. (1995). ''Cultural Power, Resistance, and Pluralism: Colonial Guyana 1838-1900.'' McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, {{ISBN|978-0-7735-1354-9}}</ref> describes the phenomenon in the 19th century as follows:\n\n{{quote|A very popular Creole pastime was the flying of kites. Easter Monday, a public holiday, was the great kite-flying day on the sea wall in Georgetown and on open lands in villages. Young and old alike, male and female, appeared to be seized by kite-flying mania. Easter 1885 serves as a good example. \"The appearance of the sky all over Georgetown, but especially towards the Sea Wall, was very striking, the air being thick with kites of all shapes and sizes, covered with gaily coloured paper, all riding bravely on the strong wind.|(His quotation is from a letter to The Creole newspaper of December 29, 1858.)}}\n\nThe exact origins of the practice of kite flying (exclusively) at Easter are unclear. Brereton and Yelvington<ref>Brereton, Bridget; Yelvington, Kevin A. (1999). ''The Colonial Caribbean in Transition''. University Press of Florida, {{ISBN|978-0-8130-1696-2}}</ref> speculate that kite flying was introduced by Chinese indentured immigrants to the then colony of British Guiana in the mid 19th century. The author of an article in the ''Guyana Chronicle'' newspaper of May 6, 2007 is more certain:\n\n{{quote|Kite flying originated as a Chinese tradition to mark the beginning of spring. However, because the plantation owners were suspicious of the planter class (read \"plantation workers\"), the Chinese claimed that it represented the resurrection of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].

Kite lines can strike and tangle on electrical power lines, causing power blackouts and running the risk of electrocuting the kite flier. Wet kite lines or wire can act as a conductor for static electricity and lightning when the weather is stormy. Kites with large surface area or powerful lift can lift kite fliers off the ground or drag them into other objects. In urban areas there is usually a ceiling on how high a kite can be flown, to prevent the kite and line infringing on the airspace of helicopters and light aircraft.  It is also possible for fighter kites to kill people, as happened in India when three spectators were killed in separate incidents during Independence Day, August, 2016\u2014precipitating a ban on certain types of enhanced line.\n\n==Designs==\n*[[Bermuda kite]]\n*[[Bowed kite]], e.g. [[Rokkaku dako|Rokkaku]]\n*Cellular or [[box kite]]\n*[[Chapi-chapi]]\n*[[Delta kite]]\n*[[Foil kite|Foil]], [[parafoil]] or [[bow kite]]\n*[[Leading edge inflatable kite]]\n*[[Malay kite]] see also [[wau bulan|wau bulan (Moon kite)]]\n*[[Tetrahedral kite]]\n*[[Sled kite]]\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:DeltaKite.JPG|This delta kite has a keel instead of a bridle\nFile:Stringoperamaskkite.JPG|Train of connected kites\n</gallery>\n\n==Types==\n{{Main|Kite types}}\n*[[Fighter kite]]\n*[[Indoor kite]]\n*[[Inflatable single-line kite]]\n*[[Kytoon]] - a hybrid tethered craft comprising both a lighter-than-air balloon as well as a kite lifting surface\n*[[Man-lifting kite]]\n*[[Rogallo wing|Rogallo parawing kite]]\n*[[Sport kite|Stunt (sport) kite]]\n*[[Paravane (water kite)|Water kite]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Airborne wind turbine]]\u2014concept for a wind generator flown as kite\n*[[Captive helicopter]]\n*[[Captive plane]]\n*[[High altitude wind power]]\n*[[Kite aerial photography]]\n*[[Kite buggying]]\n*[[Kite fishing]]\n*[[Kite ice skating]]\n*[[Kite landboarding]]\n*[[Kite (geometry)|Kite shape]] (geometry)\n*[[Kiteboating]]\n*''[[Kitelife]]''\u2014an American magazine devoted to kites.\n*[[Kitesurfing]]\n*[[Kite rig]]\n*[[List of books about kites]]\n*[[List of kite festivals]]\n*''[[Sea Tails]]'',  video installation\n*[[Solar balloon]] A solar-heated hot air balloon that can be flown like a kite, but on windless days.\n*[[Uttarayan]] The kite flying festival of western India\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|kite}}\n{{Commons|Kite}}\n{{Wikibooks|Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book|Recreation/Kites|Kites}}\n* [http://www.wokipi.com/decouverte/kite.html Kites  in many countries]\n* [http://best-breezes.squarespace.com/ History of kites]\n* [http://www.hakluyt.com/PDF/Ternate_panorama.pdf The earliest depiction of kite flying in European literature in a panorama of Ternate (Moluccas) 1600.]\n* [http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/shortk.html Mathematics and aeronautical principles of kites.]\n* [https://archive.org/details/kitecraftkitetou00milliala Kitecraft and Kite Tournaments (1914)]\u2014A free public domain e-book\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121112070727/http://www.ahmedabadkiteflyers.org/kite-museum.html Kite Museum in India]\n* {{cite web|last=Trivedi|first=Parthsarathi|title=Aerodynamics of Kites|url=http://www.ptrivedi.com/projects/kite_aerodynamics.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2013|format=PDF|display-authors=etal}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130615011353/http://eyesonbrazil.com/2012/05/06/flying-high-kids-kites/ ''Eyes on Brazil'']\n\n{{Application of wind energy}}\n{{Aircraft types (by method of thrust and lift)}}\n{{Kites}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Kites| ]]\n[[Category:Aircraft configurations]]\n[[Category:Chinese inventions]]\n[[Category:Desi culture]]\n[[Category:Physical activity and dexterity toys]]\n[[Category:Traditional toys]]", "sha1": "gb44kloao26fsdo3zjs2s4mlpb6dbik"}}, {"title": "Fanzine", "ns": "0", "id": "11101", "revision": {"id": "864589986", "parentid": "857705373", "timestamp": "2018-10-18T06:27:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "DadaNeem", "id": "2715142"}, "comment": "Filled in 1 bare reference(s) with [[:en:WP:REFILL|reFill]] () (edited with [[User:ProveIt_GT|ProveIt]]); Category see also| x 3; fixed ref", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Fanzines.jpg|thumb|Fanzines]]\nA '''fanzine''' ([[blend word|blend]] of ''[[fan (person)|fan]]'' and ''[[magazine]]'' or ''-[[zine]]'') is a non-professional and non-official publication produced by [[fan (person)|enthusiasts]] of a particular cultural [[phenomenon]] (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share their interest. The term was coined in an October 1940 [[science fiction fanzine]] by [[Russ Chauvenet]] and first popularized within [[science fiction fandom]], and from there it was adopted by other communities.\n\nTypically, [[publishers]], [[Editing|editors]], writers and other contributors of [[Article (publishing)|articles]] or [[illustration]]s to fanzines are not paid. Fanzines are traditionally circulated free of charge, or for a nominal cost to defray postage or production expenses. Copies are often offered in exchange for similar publications, or for contributions of art, articles, or letters of comment (LoCs), which are then published.\n\nSome fanzines are typed and photocopied by amateurs using standard home office equipment. A few fanzines have developed into professional publications (sometimes known as \"prozines\"), and many professional writers were first published in fanzines; some continue to contribute to them after establishing a professional reputation. The term fanzine is sometimes confused with \"[[fan magazine]]\", but the latter term most often refers to commercially produced publications ''for'' (rather than ''by'') fans.\n\n==Origin==\nThe origins of amateur [[fanac]] \"fan\" publications are obscure, but can be traced at least back to 19th century literary groups in the United States which formed [[amateur press association]]s to publish collections of amateur fiction, poetry and commentary, such as [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'s ''United Amateur''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} These publications were produced first on small tabletop printing presses, often by students.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nAs professional printing technology progressed, so did the technology of fanzines. Early fanzines were hand-drafted or typed on a manual typewriter and printed using primitive reproduction techniques (e.g., the [[spirit duplicator]] or even the [[hectograph]]). Only a very small number of copies could be made at a time, so circulation was extremely limited. The use of [[mimeograph machine]]s enabled greater press runs, and the photocopier increased the speed and ease of publishing once more. Today, thanks to the advent of [[desktop publishing]] and [[self-publishing|self-publication]], there is often little difference between the appearance of a fanzine and a professional magazine.\n\n==Genres==\n\n===Science fiction===\n{{Main article|Science fiction fanzines}}\n{{Category see also|Science fiction fanzines}}\n\nWhen [[Hugo Gernsback]] published the first [[science fiction magazine]], ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in 1926, he allowed for a large letter column which printed reader's addresses. By 1927 readers, often young adults, would write to each other, bypassing the magazine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Science fiction fanzines had their beginnings in Serious & Constructive (later shortened to [[sercon]]) correspondence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Fans finding themselves writing the same letter to several correspondents sought to save themselves a lot of typing by duplicating their letters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nEarly efforts included simple [[carbon copy|carbon copies]] but that proved insufficient.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The first science fiction fanzine, ''[[The Comet]]'', was published in 1930 by the [[Science Correspondence Club]] in [[Chicago]] and edited by [[Raymond A. Palmer]] and [[Walter Dennis]].<ref name=\"moskowitz\">{{cite book | first1 = Sam | last1 = Moskowitz | authorlink1 = Sam Moskowitz |first2=Joe |last2= Sanders|authorlink2=Joe Sanders | title = The Origins of Science Fiction Fandom: A Reconstruction | booktitle = Science Fiction Fandom | pages = 17\u201336 | publisher = Greenwood Press | year = 1994 | location = Westport, CT }}</ref> The term \"fanzine\" was coined by [[Russ Chauvenet]] in the October 1940 edition of his fanzine ''Detours''. \"Fanzines\" were distinguished from \"prozines,\" (a term Chauvenet also invented): that is, all professional [[magazine]]s. Prior to that, the fan publications were known as \"fanmags\" or \"letterzines\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nScience fiction fanzines used a variety of printing methods. Typewriters, school dittos, church mimeos and (if they could afford it) multi-color letterpress or other mid-to-high level printing. Some fans wanted their news spread, others reveled in the artistry and beauty of fine printing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The [[hectograph]], introduced around 1876, was so named because it could produce (in theory) up to a hundred copies. Hecto used an [[aniline]] dye, transferred to a tray of gelatin, and paper would be placed on the gel, one sheet at a time, for transfer. Messy and smelly, the process could create vibrant colors for the few copies produced, the easiest aniline dye to make being purple (technically [[indigo]]). The next small but significant technological step after hecto is the [[spirit duplicator]], essentially the hectography process using a drum instead of the gelatin. Introduced by  [[Ditto Corporation]] in 1923, these machines were known for the next six decades as Ditto Machines and used by fans because they were cheap to use and could (with a little effort) print in color.\n\nThe [[mimeograph]] machine, which forced ink through a wax paper stencil cut by the keys of a typewriter, was the standard for many decades. A second-hand mimeo could print hundreds of copies and (with more than a little effort) print in color. The [[electronic stencil cutter]] (shortened to \"electrostencil\" by most) could add photographs and illustrations to a mimeo stencil. A mimeo'd zine could look terrible or look beautiful, depending more on the skill of the mimeo operator than the quality of the equipment. Only a few fans could afford more professional printers, or the time it took them to print, until photocopying became cheap and ubiquitous in the 1970s. With the advent of computer printers and desktop publishing in the 1980s, fanzines began to look far more professional. The rise of the [[internet]] made correspondence cheaper and ''much'' faster, and the [[World Wide Web]] has made publishing a fanzine as simple as coding a web page.\n\nThe printing technology affected the style of writing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} For example, there were alphanumeric contractions which are actually precursors to \"[[leet]]-speak\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  (A well-known example is the \"initials\" used by [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] in his fanzines from the 30s, and 40s, namely \"4sj\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Fans around the world knew Ackerman by three letters \"4sj\" or even two: \"4e\" for \"Forry.\")  [[Fanspeak]] is rich with abbreviations and concatenations. Where teenagers labored to save typing on ditto masters, they now save keystrokes when text messaging. Ackerman invented nonstoparagraphing as a space-saving measure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Philip|title=Language of Science Fiction Fandom|journal=Word Ways|date=1975|volume=8|issue=1|pages=5\u20136}}</ref> When the typist comes to the end of a paragraph, they simply moved the platen down one line.\n\nNever commercial enterprises, most [[science fiction fanzine]]s were (and many still are) available for \"the usual,\" meaning that a sample issue will be mailed on request; to receive further issues, a reader sends a \"letter of comment\" (LoC) about the fanzine to the editor.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The LoC might be published in the next issue; some fanzines consisted almost exclusively of letter columns, where discussions were conducted in much the same way as they are in internet [[newsgroup]]s and [[mailing list]]s today, though at a relatively glacial pace. Often fanzine editors (\"faneds\") would simply swap issues with each other, not worrying too much about matching trade for trade, somewhat like being on one another's [[LiveJournal#The word .22friend.22|friends list]]. Without being closely connected with the rest of fandom, a budding faned could read fanzine reviews in prozines, and fanzines reviewed other fanzines. Recent technology has changed the speed of communication between fans and the technology available, but the basic concepts developed by science fiction fanzines in the 1930s can be seen online today. [[Blog]]s &ndash; with their threaded comments, personalized illustrations, shorthand in-jokes, wide variety in quality and wider variety of content\u2014follow the structure developed in science fiction fanzines, without (usually) realizing the antecedent.\n\nSince 1937, [[science fiction]] fans have formed [[amateur press association]]s (APAs); the members contribute to a collective assemblage or bundle that contains contributions from all of them, called [[apazine]]s and often containing [[mailing comment]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Southard|first1=Bruce|title=The Language of Science-Fiction Fan Magazines|journal=American Speech|date=Spring 1982|volume=57|issue=1|page=23|doi=10.2307/455177|jstor=i219220}}</ref>  Some APAs are still active, and some are published as virtual \"e-zines,\" distributed on the [[Internet]].<ref name=\"That's Not Online\">{{cite web|title=Amateur Press Associations (APAs) (UPDATED)|url=http://thatsnotonline.tumblr.com/post/4313215829/amateur-press-associations-apas-updated|website=That's Not Online|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> Specific [[Hugo Award]]s are given for [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine|fanzines]], [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer|fan writing]] and [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist|fanart]].\n\n==== Media  ====\nMedia fanzines were originally merely a subgenre of SF fanzines, written by science fiction fans already familiar with apazines. The first media fanzine was a ''[[Star Trek]]'' fan publication called ''Spockanalia'', published in September 1967<ref name=\"verba2003\">{{cite book | title=Boldly Writing: A Trekker Fan & Zine History, 1967-1987 | author=Verba, Joan Marie | year=2003 | publisher=FTL Publications | location=Minnetonka MN | url=http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | isbn=0-9653575-4-6}}</ref>{{rp|1}}<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/nyregion/21winston.html?pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | title=Joan Winston, \u2018Trek' Superfan, Dies at 77 | first=William | last=Grimes | date=September 21, 2008 | accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> by members of the [[Lunacon|Lunarians]].<ref name=\"cbs2000\">{{cite book | title=Science Fiction Culture | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | author=Bacon-Smith, Camille | pages=112\u2013113 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCvIZpCSRA0C&lpg=PA112&ots=5-EkbayXwL&pg=PA112#v=onepage&f=false | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-8122-1530-4}}</ref> They hoped that fanzines such as ''Spockanalia'' would be recognized by the broader science-fiction fan community in traditional ways, such as a [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine]].{{r|verba2003}}{{rp|6}} All five of its issues were published while the show was still on the air, and included letters from [[D. C. Fontana]], [[Gene Roddenberry]], and most of the cast members, and an article by future Hugo and Nebula winner [[Lois McMaster Bujold]].{{r|verba2003}}{{rp|1,2,83}}\n\nMany other Star Trek 'zines followed, then slowly zines appeared for other media sources, such as ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'', ''[[Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[Blake's 7]]''. By the mid-1970s, there were enough media zines being published that [[adzines]] existed just to advertise all of the other zines available. Although ''Spockanalia'' had a mix of stories and essays, most zines were all fiction.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Like SF fanzines, these media zines spanned the gamut of publishing quality from [[digest-sized]] mimeos to offset printed masterpieces with four-color covers.\n\nMen wrote and edited most previous science fiction fanzines, which typically published articles reporting on trips to conventions, and reviews of books and other fanzines. Camille Bacon-Smith later stated that \"One thing you almost never find in a science fiction fanzine is science fiction. Rather ... fanzines were the social glue that created a community out of a worldwide scattering of readers.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bacon-Smith|first=Camille|title=Science fiction culture|year=2000|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-1530-4|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/13333.html}}</ref> Women published most media fanzines, which by contrast also included [[fan fiction]]. By doing so, they \"fill the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official source products offered on the television and movie screen.\"{{r|cbs2000}} In addition to long and short stories, as well as poetry, many media fanzines included illustrated stories, as well as stand alone art, often featuring portraits of the show or film's principal characters. The art could range from simple sketches, to reproductions of large elaborate works painted in oil or acrylic, though most are created in ink.\n\nIn the late 1970s, fiction that included a sexual relationship between two of the male characters of the media source (first [[Kirk/Spock]], then later Starsky/Hutch, Napoleon/Illya, and many others) started to appear in zines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} This became known as [[Slash fiction|slash]] from the '/' mark used in adzines to differentiate a K&S story (which would have been a Kirk and Spock friendship story) from a K/S story, which would have been one with a romantic or sexual bent between the characters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Slash zines eventually became their own sub-subgenre; in many [[fandoms]] you rarely saw slash and non-slash stories appear in the same zines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} By 2000, when web publishing of stories became more popular than zine publishing, thousands of media fanzines had been published;<ref name=\"beyonddreamspress.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonddreamspress.com/database.htm|title=Database over Kirk/Spock Zines published - CyberDreams|work=beyonddreamspress.com}}</ref> over 500 of them were k/s zines.<ref name=\"beyonddreamspress.com\"/>\n\nAnother popular franchise for fanzines was the \"[[Star Wars]]\" saga. By the time the film \"[[The Empire Strikes Back]]\" was released in 1980 Star Wars fanzines had surpassed Star Trek zines in sales{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. An unfortunate episode in fanzine history occurred in 1981 when Star Wars director [[George Lucas]] threatened to sue fanzine publishers who distributed zines featuring the Star Wars characters in sexually explicit stories or art.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Comics ===\nComics were mentioned and discussed as early as the late 1930s in the [[science fiction fanzines|fanzines]] of [[science fiction fandom]]. Famously, the first version of [[Superman]] (a bald-headed villain) appeared in the third issue of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s 1933 fanzine ''Science Fiction''. In 1936, [[David Kyle]] published '' The Fantasy World '', possibly the first [[comics]] fanzine.<ref>Kyle, David. [http://jophan.org/mimosa/m24/kyle.htm \"Phamous Phantasy Phan\"]. [[Mimosa (magazine)|''Mimosa'']] no. 24, pp. 25-28.</ref><ref name=\"powerofcomics\"/> Malcolm Willits and Jim Bradley started ''[[The Comic Collector's News]]'' in October, 1947.<ref>{{Google books|QMnxCwAAQBAJ|Everyday Information: The Evolution of Information Seeking in America|page=286|keywords=The+Comic+Collector's+News|text=|plainurl=}}</ref> By 1952, [[Ted White (author)|Ted White]] had mimeographed a four-page pamphlet about [[Superman]], and [[James Taurasi]] issued the short-lived ''Fantasy Comics''. In 1953, [[Bhob Stewart]] published ''The EC Fan Bulletin'',<ref name=\"powerofcomics\">{{Google books|PA175|The Power of Comics: History, Form and Culture|page=175|keywords=EC+Fan+Bulletin|text=|plainurl=}}</ref> which launched [[EC Comics|EC]] fandom of imitative EC fanzines. A few months later, Stewart, White and [[Larry Stark]] produced ''Potrzebie'', planned as a literary journal of critical commentary about EC by Stark. Among the wave of EC fanzines that followed, the best-known was [[Ron Parker (writer)|Ron Parker]]'s ''Hoo-Hah!''. After that came fanzines by the followers of [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', ''[[Trump (magazine)|Trump]]'' and ''[[Humbug (magazine)|Humbug]]''. Publishers of these included future [[underground comics]] stars like [[Jay Lynch]] and [[Robert Crumb]].\n\nIn 1960, [[Richard A. Lupoff|Richard and Pat Lupoff]] launched their [[science fiction fandom|science fiction]] and comics fanzine ''[[Xero (SF fanzine)|Xero]]''. In the second issue, \"The Spawn of M.C. Gaines'\" by Ted White was the first in a series of nostalgic, analytical articles about comics by Lupoff, [[Don Thompson (Comics Buyer's Guide)|Don Thompson]], [[Bill Blackbeard]], [[Jim Harmon]] and others under the heading, ''All In Color For A Dime.'' In 1961, [[Jerry Bails]]' ''[[Alter Ego (fanzine)|Alter Ego]]'', devoted to [[superhero|costumed heroes]],<ref name=\"powerofcomics\"/>f became a focal point for superhero comics fandom and is thus sometimes mistakenly cited as the first comics fanzine.\n\nContacts through these magazines were instrumental in creating the culture of modern [[comics fandom]]: conventions, collecting, etc. Much of this, like comics fandom itself, began as part of standard [[science fiction convention]]s, but comics fans have developed their own traditions. Comics fanzines often include fan artwork based on existing characters as well as discussion of the history of comics. Through the 1960s, and 1970s, comic fanzines followed some general formats, such as the industry news and information magazine (''[[The Comic Reader]]'' was one example), interview, history and review-based fanzines, and the fanzines which basically represented independent comic book-format exercises. While perceived quality varied widely, the energy and enthusiasm involved tended to be communicated clearly to the readership, many of whom were also fanzine contributors. During the 1970s, many fanzines (''[[Squa Tront]]'', as example) also became partly distributed through certain comic book distributors.\n\nAt times, the professional comics publishers have made overtures to fandom via 'prozines', in this case fanzine-like magazines put out by the major publishers. ''[[The Amazing World of DC Comics]]'' and the Marvel magazine ''[[FOOM]]'' began and ceased publication in the 1970s. Priced significantly higher than standard comics of the period (''AWODCC'' was $1.50, ''FOOM'' was 75 cents), each house-organ magazine lasted a brief period of years. Since 2001 in Britain, there have been created a number of fanzines pastiching children's comics of the 1970s, and 1980s (e.g. ''[[Solar Wind (comic)|Solar Wind]]'', ''Pony School'', etc.). These adopt a style of storytelling rather than specific characters from their sources, usually with a knowing or [[irony|ironic]] twist.\n\n===Horror film ===\n[[File:Horrors of the Screen 3 fanzine cover 1964.jpg|thumb|right|Horrors of the Screen #3, 1964]]\nAs with comics zines, horror film fanzines grew from related interest within science fiction fan publications.  ''Trumpet,'' edited by [[Tom Reamy]], was a 1960s SF zine that branched into horror film coverage. Alex Soma's ''Horrors of the Screen,''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/unifan2001/HotS.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027140344/http://www.geocities.com/unifan2001/HotS.html|title=Horrors of the Screen|archivedate=27 October 2009|work=archive.org}}</ref> [[Calvin T.

Stover's ''Black Oracle'' partner Bill George published his own short-lived zine ''The Late Show'' (1974\u20131976; with co-editor Martin Falck), and later became editor of the ''Cinefantastique'' prozine spinoff ''[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]].'' In the mid-1970s, [[North Carolina]] teenager [[Sam Irvin]] published the horror/science-fiction fanzine ''Bizarre'' which included his original interviews with UK actors and filmmakers; Irvin would later become a producer-director in his own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/directories/profile.cfm?id=33692&first=&last=&title=&did=1&referer=%2Fproduction%2Ffaculty.cfm&startpage=1&startrow=31|title=School of Cinematic Arts Directory Profile - USC School of Cinematic Arts|work=usc.edu}}</ref> ''Japanese Fantasy Film Journal'' (JFFJ) (1968\u20131983) from Greg Shoemaker covered [[Toho]]'s ''[[Godzilla]]'' and his Asian brethren when no other publications much cared.

[[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]] and [[Greg Shaw]] were two such SF-fans turned rock zine editors. Williams' ''[[Crawdaddy!]]'' (1966) and Shaw's two California-based zines, ''Mojo Navigator'' (full title, \"''Mojo-Navigator Rock and Roll News''\") (1966) and ''[[Who Put the Bomp]]'', (1970), are among the most important early rock fanzines.\n\n''[[Crawdaddy!]]'' (1966) quickly moved from its fanzine roots to become one of the first rock music \"prozines,\" with paid advertisers and newsstand distribution. ''Bomp'' remained a fanzine, featuring many writers who would later become prominent music journalists, including [[Lester Bangs]], [[Greil Marcus]], Ken Barnes, [[Ed Ward (writer)|Ed Ward]], [[Dave Marsh]], [[Mike Saunders]] and [[Richard Meltzer|R. Meltzer]].  ''Bomp'' featured cover art by Jay Kinney and Bill Rotsler, both veterans of SF and Comics fandom. ''Bomp'' was not alone; an August 1970 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included an article about the explosion of rock fanzines. Other rock fanzines of this period include ''[[denim delinquent]]'' 1971, edited by Jymn Parrett, ''Flash,'' 1972, edited by Mark Shipper, ''Eurock Magazine'' (1973\u20131993) edited by Archie Patterson and ''Bam Balam,'' written and published by Brian Hogg in East Lothian, Scotland, beginning in 1974, and in the mid-1970s, ''[[Back Door Man (fanzine)|Back Door Man]]''.\n\nIn the post-punk era several well-written fanzines emerged that cast an almost academic look at earlier, neglected musical forms, including Mike Stax' ''[[Ugly Things]]'', Billy Miller and [[Miriam Linna]]'s ''Kicks'', Jake Austen's ''[[Roctober (fanzine)|Roctober]]'', Kim Cooper's ''[[Scram (fanzine)|Scram]]'', P. Edwin Letcher's ''[[Garage & Beat]]'', and the UK's [[Shindig! (magazine)|Shindig!]] and Italy's ''[[Misty Lane]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, with the rise of stadium superstars, many home-grown rock fanzines emerged. At the peak of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s megastardom following the ''[[Born in the U.S.A.]]'' album and [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]] in the mid-1980s, there were no less than five Springsteen fanzines circulating at the same time in the UK alone, and many others elsewhere. Gary Desmond's ''Candy's Room'', coming from Liverpool, was the first in 1980, quickly followed by Dan French's ''Point Blank'', Dave Percival's ''The Fever'', Jeff Matthews' ''Rendezvous'', and Paul Limbrick's ''Jackson Cage''. In the US, ''[[Backstreets Magazine]]'' started in Seattle in 1980 and still continues today as a glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteen's management and official website. In the late 1990s, notorious fanzines and e-zines flourished about electronic and [[post-rock]] music. ''Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e'' fanzine was one of those that documented post-rock genre and experimental music.\n\n===Punk ===\n{{Main article|Punk zine}}\n{{Category see also|Punk zines}}\n[[File:1970s fanzines (21224199545).jpg|thumb|British punk fanzines from the 1970s.]]\n\n====UK ====\n\nThe [[punk subculture]] in the United Kingdom spearheaded a surge of interest in fanzines as a countercultural alternative to established print media. The first and still best known UK 'punk zine' was ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'', produced by [[Deptford, London|Deptford]] punk fan [[Mark Perry (musician)|Mark Perry]].  ''Sniffin' Glue'' ran for 12 photocopied issues; the first issue was produced by Perry immediately following (and in response to) the London debut of [[The Ramones]] on 4 July 1976. Other UK fanzines included ''[[Blam! (fanzine)|Blam!]]'', ''[[Bombsite (fanzine)|Bombsite]]'', [http://si-site-nogsy.blogspot.com/2010/08/were-from-bradford.html Wool City Rocker], ''Burnt Offering'', ''[[Chainsaw (punk zine)|Chainsaw]]'', ''[[New Crimes]]'', ''[[Vague (fanzine)|Vague]]'', ''[[Jamming (fanzine)|Jamming]]'', [[Artcore Fanzine]], ''[[Love and Molotov Cocktails]]'', ''[[To Hell With Poverty]]'', ''[[New Youth (fanzine)|New Youth]]'', ''[[Peroxide (punk zine)|Peroxide]]'', ''[[ENZK]]'', ''[[Juniper beri-beri]]'', ''[[No Cure]]'',''[[Communication Blur]]'', ''[[Rox (fanzine)|Rox]]'', ''[[Grim Humour]]'', ''[[Spuno]]'' <ref name=\"Spuno info online\">{{cite web|url=http://si-site-nogsy.blogspot.com/2011/07/spuno-3-1980.html|title=essential ephemera|author=Si|work=si-site-nogsy.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n, ''[[Cool Notes]]'' and ''[[Fumes (magazine)|Fumes]]''. Of these, Tony Fletcher's ''Jamming'' was the most far reaching, becoming a nationally distributed mainstream magazine for several years before its demise.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n====US ====\nIn the US, ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]'' and ''[[Slash (fanzine)|Slash]]'' were important punk zines for the Los Angeles scene, both debuting in 1977. In 1977 in Australia, Bruce Milne and [[Clinton Walker]] fused their respective punk zines ''Plastered Press'' and ''Suicide Alley'' to launch ''Pulp''; Milne later went on to invent the cassette zine with ''Fast Forward'', in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://messandnoise.com/features/4331535|title=Fast Forward: A Pre-Internet Story|author=|date=18 September 2011|website=messandnoise.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonwalker.com.au/fanzines-1970s.html|title=Fanzines (1970s)|author=|date=|website=Clinton Walker|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> Starting earlier, in 1976, ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'' was published in New York and played a major part in popularizing [[Punk rock#Etymology|punk rock]] (a term coined a few years earlier in ''[[Creem]]'') as the term for the music and the bands being written about.\n\nAmong later titles, ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]'' is a major punk zine, with over 300 issues published. As a result, in part, of the popular and commercial resurgence of punk in the late 1980s, and after, with the growing popularity of such bands as [[Sonic Youth]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]], [[Bikini Kill]], [[Green Day]] and [[The Offspring]], a number of other punk zines have appeared, such as ''[[Punk Planet]]'', ''[[Razorcake]]'', ''[[Tail Spins]]'', ''[[Sobriquet (magazine)|Sobriquet]]'', ''[[Profane Existence]]'' and ''[[Slug and Lettuce (fanzine)|Slug and Lettuce]]''. The early American punkzine ''[[RE/Search|Search and Destroy]]'' eventually became the influential fringe-cultural magazine ''[[Re/Search]]''.\n\nSome punk fanzines from the 80s, like No Class fanzine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noclass.co.uk|title=No Class Fanzine, No Class Records, No Class Now, No Class Gigs|work=noclass.co.uk}}</ref> and Ugly American <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uglyamericanzine.com|title=The Official Ugly American Zine Archives, 1988-1999.|work=uglyamericanzine.com}}</ref> are experiencing a second life by placing all past content online for free and adding new content. For the past 6 years, Suburban Rebels in Northern California has been leading the Punk zine way.\n\nMany of the punk zines were printed in small quantities and promoted the local scene. They were often cheaply photocopied and many never survived beyond a few issues. Their greatest contribution was in promoting punk music, clothing and lifestyle in their local communities. Punk bands and independent labels often sent records to the zines for review and many of the people who started the zines became critical connections for punk bands on tour.\n\n====After the year 2000====\n\nIn the UK ''[[Fracture (fanzine)|Fracture]]'' and ''[[Reason To Believe (fanzine)|Reason To Believe]]'' were significant fanzines in the early 2000s, but both ended in late 2003. ''[[Rancid News]]'' filled the gap left by these two zines for a short while. On its tenth issue ''Rancid News'' changed its name to ''[[Last Hours]]'' with 7 issues published under this title before going on hiatus. ''Last Hours'' still operates as a [[webzine]] though with more focus on the anti-authoritarian movement than its original title. ''[[Artcore Fanzine]]'' (established in 1986) continues to this day, recently publishing a number of 30 year anniversary issues. There are many smaller fanzines in existence throughout the UK that focus on punk.\n\n=====Mark Wilkins and Mystic Records=====\n\nMark Wilkins, the promotion director for 1982 onwards US punk/thrash label [[Mystic Records]], had over 450 US fanzines and 150 foreign fanzines he promoted to regularly. He and Mystic Records owner Doug Moody edited ''The Mystic News Newsletter'' which was published quarterly and went into every promo package to fanzines. Wilkins also published the highly successful Los Angeles punk humor zine ''Wild Times'' and when he ran out of funding for the zine syndicated some of the humorous material to over 100 US fanzines under the name of Mystic Mark.\n\n====Italy====\nIn [[Perugia]], [[Italy]], ''Mazquerade'' ran from 1979 to 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perugiamusica.com/RIVISTE/MAZQUERADE/mazquerade.html|title=Perugiamusica.com|author=|date=|website=perugiamusica.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Basilicata]], [[Italy]], ''Raw Art Fanzine'' ran from 1995 to 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truemetal.it/news/raw-art-fanzine-restauro-digitale-e-disponibilita-dei-numeri-degli-anni-90-89535|title=Raw Art Fanzine: restauro digitale e disponibilit\u00e0 dei numeri degli anni '90|author=|date=|website=truemetal.it|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Mod===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the 1979 [[Mod revival]], which was inspired by the 1960s [[Mod subculture]], brought with it a burst of fresh creativity from fanzines, and for the next decade, the youth [[subculture]] inspired the production of dozens of independent publications. The most successful of the first wave was ''Maximum Speed'', which successfully captured the frenetic world of a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] revival scene that was propelling bands like [[Secret Affair]], [[Purple Hearts (British band)|Purple Hearts]] and [[The Chords]] into the UK charts.\n\nAfter the genre had started to go out of fashion with mainstream audiences in 1981, the mod revival scene went underground and successfully reinvented itself through a series of clubs, bands and fanzines that breathed fresh life into the genre, culminating in another burst of creative acceptance in 1985. This success was largely driven by the network of underground fanzines, the most important and far reaching of which were ''Extraordinary Sensations'', produced by future radio DJ [[Eddie Piller]], and ''Shadows & Reflections'', published by future national magazine editor [[Chris Hunt]]. The latter in particular pushed back the boundaries of fanzine production, producing glossy, professionally written and printed publications at a time (1983\u201386) when most fanzines were produced via photocopier and letraset.\n\n===Local music===\nIn the UK, there were also fanzines that covered the local music scene in a particular town or city. Mainly prevalent in the 1970s, and 1980s, all music styles were covered, whether the bands were playing rock, punk, metal, futurist, ska or dance. Featured were local gig reviews and articles that were below the radar of the mainstream music press. They were produced using the technology of the time, i.e. typewriter and [[Letraset]]. Examples include ''[[Bombsite Fanzine]]'' (Liverpool 1977), [http://si-site-nogsy.blogspot.com/2010/08/were-from-bradford.html Wool City Rocker] (Bradford 1979 - 1982), ''[[City Fun]]'' (Manchester), 1984, [http://si-site-nogsy.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/spuno-3-1980.html Spuno] (Bath 1980) <ref name=\"Spuno info online\"/> ''[[No Cure]]'' (Berkshire) and ''[[Town Hall Steps (fanzine)|Town Hall Steps]]'' (Bolton) and more recently [[''mono'' (fanzine)]], (Bradford) with many more across the country, such as Premonition Tapes Tapezine on cassette (Sheffield 1987) and Crime Pays (Liverpool 1988).\n\n===Role-playing-game fanzines===\nAnother sizable group of fanzines arose in [[role-playing game]] (RPG) fandom, where fanzines allowed people to publish their ideas and views on specific games and their [[role-playing campaigns]]. In 1975, was released the apazine [[Alarums and Excursions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024220743/http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html|title=RPG Magzine and zine Index- Alarms & Excursions Page|date=24 October 2006|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nRole-playing fanzines allowed people to communicate in the 1970s, and 1980s with complete editorial control in the hands of the players, as opposed to the game publishers. These early RPG fanzines were generally typed, sold mostly in an A5 format (in the UK) and were usually illustrated with abysmal or indifferent artwork. \n\nA fanzine community developed and was based on sale to a reading public and exchanges by editor/publishers. Many of the pioneers of RPG zinedom got their start in, or remain part of, [[science fiction fandom]]. This is also true of the small but still active [[board game]] fandom scene, the most prolific subset of which is centered around [[play-by-mail game|play-by-mail]] [[Diplomacy game|Diplomacy]].\n\nThe UK fanzine [[Aslan (fanzine)|Aslan]] (1988-1991)<ref>{{Google books|ix9WDwAAQBAJ|Role-Playing Game Studies: Transmedia Foundations|page=|keywords=aslan+fanzine|text=|plainurl=}}</ref> was responsible for popularization of [[freeform role-playing game]]s in the UK.<ref name=nnbtv>{{cite web |url=http://nnbtv.org.uk/Games/History.html|title=Me and Freeforms|accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Video gaming ===\nVideo game fanzines first emerged during the [[History of video game consoles (second generation)|second generation period]] when newsletters for computer user groups and stores were not uncommon, though not always well-known. Subscriber-based newsletters included the well-known ''[[8: 16 (UK, all things Atari, 1st issue Nov 1987)]]'',''[[The Video Game Update]]'' and later ''[[Computer Entertainer]]''. The publication, ''[[Joystick Jolter]]'' was the first actual fanzine.\n\nLater, as desktop publishing tools became more accessible, there was an increase in fanzine production. Fanzines generally emphasized either classic gaming (e.g. ''[[2600 Connection]]'' and ''[[Classic Systems & Games Monthly]]''), or current gaming (e.g. ''[[APE (fanzine)|APE]]'' and ''[[The Subversive Sprite]]''). However some fanzines covered both topics (e.g. ''[[Digital Press]]'' and ''[[Joystick & Screen]]''). The number of zines grew bigger when video game journalists including [[Arnie Katz]] and [[Chris Bieniek]] used their columns to publish reviews of fanzines that they had been sent at magazines like ''[[Video Games & Computer Entertainment]]'', ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'', and ''[[Tips & Tricks]]''. These reviews had the effect of introducing fan editors to each other and creating a fanzine scene.\n\nThe video game fanzine diminished greatly in popularity with the rise of the web, though some zines\u2014particularly the classic gaming ones\u2014continued past the mid-90s (e.g. ''[[Classic Gamer Magazine]]'' and ''[[Video Game Collector]]''). The rise of \"on demand\" publishing has led to a new outlet for print zines, like ''[[Jumpbutton]]'' and ''[[Scroll]]''.\n\nThe video game fanzine era was biggest in the US and Canada,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} but there were/are zines from other countries too. Video game fanzines in UK have included ''[[Retrogamer]]'', ''[[Pixel Nation]]'', ''[[Capcom Fanzine]]'', ''[[Mercury (fanzine)|Mercury]]'', and ''[[Super Famicom Mini Mag]]'' among others.<ref>Bielby, Matt, ed. \"Super Express - Fanhunter: Super Play's Fanzine Round-Up.\" ''[[Super Play]]''. Issue 9, Pg.14. July 1993. {{ISSN|0966-6192}}.</ref> In France fanzines like ''[[Revival (fanzine)|Revival]]'' we circulated, and Japan has seen the production of lavish [[doujin]] works.\n\nMore recently, there has been a mini-resurgence in video game fanzines, with the launch of HyperPlay RPG in 2015 and Switch Player in 2017. Based in part on the above-mentioned Super Play with a focus on role-playing games and \"any-bit\" Nintendo,<ref>hyperplayrpg.com</ref> popular fanzine HyperPlay RPG has been consistently well-reviewed by the mainstream video game media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/09/hyperplay_rpg_is_a_glorious_throwback_to_the_pre-internet_days_of_homemade_fanzines|title=HyperPlay RPG Is A Glorious Throwback To The Pre-Internet Days Of Homemade Fanzines|first=Nintendo|last=Life|date=27 September 2015|website=nintendolife.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Wargaming===\nSeveral fanzines exist within the hobby of [[wargaming]]. Among them is ''[[CHARGE! (magazine)|Charge!]]'', a leading international fanzine exclusively for [[miniature wargaming]] enthusiasts for the [[American Civil War]] period. Other fanzines support [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle|Warhammer]] and other popular rules sets.\n\n===Sport===\n{{Category see also|Football fanzines}}\nThe first [[association football]] fanzine is regarded as being [[Foul (fanzine)|Foul]], a publication that ran between 1972 and 1976.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet 7: Fan 'Power' and Democracy in Football |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/so/css/resources/factsheets/fs7.html |work=Department of Sociology: Sports Resources |publisher=University of Leicester |accessdate=25 August 2010 |author=Gavin Barber (updated by John Williams) |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821184842/http://www.le.ac.uk/so/css/resources/factsheets/fs7.html |archivedate=21 August 2010 |df= }}</ref> In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], most [[Premier League]] or [[The Football League|Football League]] [[association football|football]] clubs have one or more fanzines which supplement, oppose and complement the club's official magazine or matchday programme. A reasonably priced 'zine has a guaranteed audience, as is the culture of passion in being a football fan.\n\nThe longest running fanzine is ''[[The City Gent (fanzine)|The City Gent]]'', produced by supporters of [[Bradford City FC]], which first went on sale at Valley Parade in November 1984 and is now in its 26th season. Following close on its heels was Nike, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a-love-supreme.com|title=A Love Supreme - The Independent Sunderland Football Club Fanzine|author=Azure Graphic & Web Design|work=a-love-supreme.com}}</ref> which was first released in 1989. At the time it was not the first of its kind with ''Terrace Talk'' (York City), which was first published in November 1981 and ''Wanderers Worldwide'' (Bolton Wanderers) having already been established but since disappeared. In 1985 the emergent ''[[When Saturday Comes]]'' (a fanzine without a specific club focus that was subsequently launched as a mainstream magazine) promoted a 'fanzine movement' that gave birth to many more club titles during the late 1980s which was something of a glory period for fanzines.\n\nWith the widespread availability of the Internet, much of the energy that was put into football fanzines subsequently went into the development of supporters' websites. Examples of other UK football fanzines include ''[[A Love Supreme (fanzine)|A Love Supreme]]'' ([[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]]), ''[[TOOFIF]]'' ([[Fulham FC|Fulham]]), ''[[4,000 Holes]]'' ([[Blackburn Rovers]]) and ''[[War of the Monster Trucks]]'' (a [[Sheffield Wednesday]] fanzine named after a local TV station elected not to show the final scenes of an unlikely cup victory). The Queen's Park Rangers fanzine 'A Kick up the Rs' was first published in August 1987 and is still issuing an average of 10 issues per season.\n\nFanzines are not exclusive to the top tiers of football however, with [[Northern Counties East League]] side [[Scarborough Athletic FC]] having a fanzine titled ''[[Abandon Chip!]]'', a pun based on both the perilous situation of predecessor club [[Scarborough FC]] and that club's sponsors, [[McCain Foods Limited|McCain]].\n\nAnd also away from the world of Football there were a number of established fanzines, for example [[Rugby League]] has such notable publications as ''[[Who The Hell Was St. George Anyway?]]'' Rugby League fanzine, by supporters of Doncaster RLFC and ''Scarlet Turkey'' of [[Salford Red Devils|Salford City Reds]].However, due to pressure from the Internet etc. these publications no longer exist in printed form. The title of World's longest running Rugby League fanzine now belongs to ''[[The Aye Of The Tigers]]'', by Castleford Tigers supporters. The fanzine movement has even spread to the [[United States]], where ice hockey fans have produced several popular fanzines. In [[Chicago]] two examples include the formerly published ''Blue Line Magazine'' and currently ''The Committed Indian'', both produced by [[Chicago Blackhawks]] fans.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chitowndailynews.org/2009/05/27/The-Committed-Indian-Snark-and-in-depth-report-informs-and-entertains-27581.html | title=The Committed Indian; Snark and in-depth report informs and entertains | work=[[Chi-Town Daily News]] | date=May 27, 2009 | accessdate=October 18, 2018 | author=Grant, Lou | archiveurl=http://archive.is/ipwww | archivedate= July 3, 2013|deadurl=yes}}</ref> In [[St. Louis]] there are ''Game Night Revue'' and ''St Louis Game Time'' for the [[St. Louis Blues]].\n\nThere are also a number of fanzines to be found in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] of which [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]]'s ''Red Inc.'' is the longest running.\n\nIn the [[United States]], sports fanzines are relatively rare. In [[Boston]] they are a bit more common. There are two fanzines sold outside Fenway Park including ''Yawkey Way Report'', which is run by a former Marine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://yawkeywayreport.com/meet-the-staff/ceo-sly-egidio/|title=CEO Sly Egidio - Yawkey Way Report|newspaper=Yawkey Way Report|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/10/fenway-scene-war-among-rival-hawkers-game-programs/eTsR16JIvyshTp3S7tLhEJ/story.html|title=Fenway program hawkers\u2019 rivalry fuels competition|newspaper=Boston Globe|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-21}}</ref>\n\n==Recent developments==\nWith the increasing availability of the [[Internet]] in the late 20th and the early 21st century, the traditional paper zine has begun to give way to the [[webzine]] (or \"e-zine\") that is easier to produce and uses the potential of the Internet to reach an ever-larger, possibly global, audience. Nonetheless, printed fanzines are still produced, either out of preference for the format or to reach people who do not have convenient Web access. Online versions of approximately 200 [[science fiction fanzine]]s will be found at Bill Burns'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eFanzines.com|title=eFanzines.com|author=|date=|website=www.efanzines.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> eFanzines web site, along with links to other [[science fiction fanzine|SF fanzine]] sites.

Most of its releases begin with these stories then add background material to explain the settings (often as [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate worlds]], whose history diverges from our own), adventures, and other game material.\n\n==Game system==\nThe base system uses three characteristics (Body, Mind, and Soul) and a range of skills; points are used to purchase characteristics and skills based on one or more of the characteristics. Skills and characteristics are used by opposing them to a target (such as a difficulty number, an opponent's skill or characteristics, etc.) using a 2D6 dice roll. Subsequent revisions to the rules add options including a Magic characteristic, melodramatic character traits, and other complications, but the core system remains unchanged.\n\nRowland is believed to have pioneered the concept of [[shareware]] tabletop role-playing games with this system,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} although there were earlier shareware computer games with role-playing elements. Users can download the rules from his web site, buy a subscription that entitles them to Forgotten Futures CDs, or buy a copy of the published version of this game. The CDs are also good sources for science fiction books and other period material whose copyright has expired. A proportion of his income from the game is donated to cancer research charities.\n\nCurrently several versions of the rules are on line (complete and summary versions in HTML and PDF, and a German translation in PDF), along with a sample adventure set in a Victorian [[Channel Tunnel]], plus eleven game collections (source material plus background [[worldbook]], [[adventures]], etc.), with an expanding collection of additional resources on line and on the CD-ROM. The rules and sample adventure have twice been published in print; in brief form as a booklet given away with ''[[Arcane Magazine]]'' in 1997, and at full length by [[Heliograph Inc.]] in 1999.\n\nIn May 2016 Rowland announced that due to delays in the next release and changes in European tax law he would end shareware distribution of the game. Instead he intends to put all of the existing material on line, including the full contents of the CD, with a tip jar for voluntary contributions, and hopes to add more material. Users with current shareware registrations were offered a partial refund or the option to donate it to Cancer Research UK.<ref name=\"Forgotten Futures Shareware Registration Ending\">{{cite web|last1=Rowland|first1=Marcus|title=Forgotten Futures Shareware Registration Ending|url=http://ffutures-news.insanejournal.com/2016/05/09/|website=Forgotten Futures News|accessdate=13 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Versions ==\n\n; ''Forgotten Futures I: The A.B.C.

The town's name is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for \"dignity\", which elevated its [[symbol]]ism to the Arab people, especially after the Arab defeat in 1967. The operation was in response to attacks against Israel, including rockets strikes from Fatah and other Palestinian militias into the occupied West Bank. Knowledge of the operation was available well ahead of time, and the government of Jordan (as well as a number of Fatah commandos) informed Arafat of Israel's large-scale military preparations. Upon hearing the news, many guerrilla groups in the area, including George Habash's newly formed group the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) and [[Nayef Hawatmeh]]'s breakaway organization the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (DFLP), withdrew their forces from the town. Fatah leaders were advised by a pro-Fatah Jordanian divisional commander to withdraw their men and headquarters to nearby hills, but on Arafat's orders, Fatah remained, and the [[Royal Jordanian Army|Jordanian Army]] agreed to back them if heavy fighting ensued.<ref name=\"Aburish\"/>\n\nOn the night of 21 March, the IDF attacked Karameh with heavy weaponry, armored vehicles and fighter jets.<ref name=\"Aburish\"/> Fatah held its ground, surprising the Israeli military.

After their victory in the Battle of Karameh, Fatah and other Palestinian militias began taking control of civil life in Jordan. They set up roadblocks, publicly humiliated Jordanian police forces, molested women and levied illegal taxes \u2013 all of which Arafat either condoned or ignored.<ref>Sayigh, Yezid (1997).

Two thousand Fatah fighters managed to enter [[Syria]]. They crossed the border into Lebanon to join Fatah forces in that country, where they set up their new headquarters. A large group of guerrilla fighters led by Fatah field commander [[Abu Ali Iyad]] held out the Jordanian Army's offensive in the northern city of [[Ajloun|Ajlun]] until they were decisively defeated in July 1971. Abu Ali Iyad was executed and surviving members of his commando force formed the [[Black September Organization]], a splinter group of Fatah. In November 1971, the group assassinated Jordanian prime minister [[Wasfi al-Tal]] as retaliation to Abu Ali Iyad's execution.<ref>Seale, 1992, pp.81\u201382.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s and the 1970s, Fatah provided training to a wide range of European, Middle Eastern, Asian, and African militant and insurgent groups, and carried out numerous attacks against Israeli targets in Western Europe and the Middle East during the 1970s. Some militant groups that affiliated themselves to Fatah, and some of the ''fedayeen'' within Fatah itself, carried out civilian-[[aircraft hijacking]]s and terrorist attacks, attributing them to Black September, [[Abu Nidal]]'s [[Abu Nidal Organization|Fatah-Revolutionary Council]], [[Said al-Muragha|Abu Musa]]'s group, the PFLP, and the PFLP-GC.

Succumbing to pressure from PLO sub-groups such as the PFLP, DFLP and the [[Palestine Liberation Front]] (PLF), Fatah aligned itself with the communist and [[Nasserism|Nasserist]] [[Lebanese National Movement]] (LNM). Although originally aligned with Fatah, [[President of Syria|Syrian President]] [[Hafez al-Assad]] feared a loss of influence in Lebanon and switched sides. He sent his army, along with the [[Syria]]n-backed Palestinian factions of [[as-Sa'iqa]] and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine \u2013 General Command]] (PFLP-GC) led by [[Ahmed Jibril|Ahmad Jibril]] to fight alongside the Christian forces against the PLO and the LNM.

Because of this, the movement remains largely dominated by aging cadres from the pre-Oslo era of Palestinian politics. Several of them gained their positions through the patronage of Yasser Arafat, who balanced above the different factions, and the era after his death in 2004 has seen increased infighting among these groups, who jockey for influence over future development, the political line, funds, and constituencies. The prospect of Abbas leaving power in the coming years has also exacerbated tensions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nThere have been no open splits within the older generation of Fatah politicians since the 1980s, though there is occasional friction between members of the top leadership. One founding member, [[Farouk Kaddoumi|Faruq al-Qaddumi]] (Abu Lutf), continues to openly oppose the post-Oslo arrangements and has intensified his campaign for a more hardline position from exile in [[Tunis]]. Since Arafat's death, he is formally head of Fatah's political bureau and chairman, but his actual political following within Fatah appears limited. He has at times openly challenged the legitimacy of Abbas and harshly criticized both him and [[Mohammed Dahlan]], but despite threats to splinter the movement, he remains in his position, and his challenges have so far been fruitless. Another influential veteran, [[Hani al-Hassan]], has also openly criticized the present leadership.\n\nFatah's internal conflicts have also, due to the creation of the Palestinian Authority, merged with the turf wars between different PA security services, e.g., a longstanding rivalry between the West Bank ([[Jibril Rajoub]]) and Gaza (Muhammad Dahlan) branches of the powerful Preventive Security Service. Foreign backing for different factions contribute to conflict, e.g., with the United States generally seen as supportive of Abbas's overall leadership and of Dahlan's security influence, and Syria alleged to promote Faruq al-Qaddumi's challenge to the present leadership. The younger generations of Fatah, especially within the militant [[al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]], have been more prone to splits, and a number of lesser networks in Gaza and the West Bank have established themselves as either independent organizations or joined Hamas. However, such overt breaks with the movement have still been rather uncommon, despite numerous rivalries inside and between competing local Fatah groups.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n====2009 6th General Assembly====\nThe Sixth General Assembly of the Fatah Movement began on 4 August 2009 in [[Bethlehem]], nearly 16 years after the [[Oslo I Accord]] and 20 years since the last Fatah convention, after being repeatedly postponed over conflicts ranging from who would be represented, to what venue would be acceptable.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120708043824/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249275691810&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull editiorial.jpost.com Fatah's goals].

The group has also dominated various PLO and Palestinian Authority forces and security services which were/are not officially tied to Fatah, but in practice have served as wholly pro-Fatah armed units, and been staffed largely by members. The original name for Fatah's armed wing was al-'Asifah (\"The Storm\"), and this was also the name Fatah first used in its communiques, trying for some time to conceal its identity. This name has since been applied more generally to Fatah armed forces, and does not correspond to a single unit today. Other militant groups associated with Fatah include:\n*[[Force 17]]. Plays a role akin to the Presidential Guard for senior Fatah leaders.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Created by Yasser Arafat.\n*[[Black September Organization]]. A group formed by leading Fatah members in 1971, following the events of the \"[[Black September]]\" in Jordan, to organize clandestine attacks with which Fatah did not want to be openly associated. These included strikes against leading Jordanian politicians as a means of exacting vengeance and raising the price for attacking the Palestinian movement; and also, most controversially, for \"international operations\" (e.g. the [[Munich massacre|Munich Olympics massacre]]), intended to put pressure on the US, Europe and Israel, to raise the visibility of the Palestinian cause and to upstage radical rivals such as the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PFLP]]. Fatah publicly disassociated itself from the group, but it is widely believed that it enjoyed Arafat's direct or tacit backing. It was discontinued in 1973\u20131974, as Fatah's political line shifted again, and the Black September operations and the strategy behind them were seen as having become a political liability, rather than an asset.\n*[[Fatah Hawks]]. An armed militia active mainly until the mid-1990s.\n*[[Tanzim]]. A branch of Fatah under the leadership of Marwan Barghouti, with roots in the activism of the [[First Intifada]], which carried out armed attacks in the early days of the Second Intifada. It was later subsumed or sidelined by the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.\n*[[Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]]. Created during the Second Intifada to bolster the organization's militant standing vis-\u00e0-vis the rival Hamas movement, which had taken the lead in attacks on Israel after 1993, and was gaining rapidly in popularity with the advent of the Intifada. The Brigades are locally organized and have been said to suffer from poor cohesion and internal discipline, at times ignoring ceasefires and other initiatives announced by the central Fatah leadership. They are generally seen as tied to the \"young guard\" of Fatah politics, organizing young members on the street level, but it is not clear that they form a faction in themselves inside Fatah politics; rather, different Brigades units may be tied to different Fatah factional leaders.\n\nDuring the Second Intifada, the group was a member of the [[Palestinian National and Islamic

The agency is directed by the Conference of Member Nations, which meets every two years to review the work carried out by the organization and to Work and Budget for the next two-year period. The Conference elects a council of 49 member states (serve three-year rotating terms) that acts as an interim governing body, and the Director-General, that heads the agency.\n\nFAO is composed of eight departments: Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Climate, Biodiversity, Land and Water Department, Economic and Social Development, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Forestry, Corporate Services and Technical Cooperation and Programme Management.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/about/who-we-are/departments/en/ |title=Home > About FAO > Who we are |date=2016 |website=fao.org |accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1994, FAO underwent the most significant restructuring since its founding, to decentralize operations, streamline procedures and reduce costs. As a result, savings of about US$50 million, \u20ac35 million a year were realized.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n===Budget===\nFAO's Regular Programme budget is funded by its members, through contributions set at the FAO Conference. This budget covers core technical work, cooperation and partnerships including the Technical Cooperation Programme, knowledge exchange, policy and advocacy, direction and administration, governance and security.\n\nThe total FAO Budget planned for 2016\u20132017 is USD 2.6 billion. The voluntary contributions provided by members and other partners support mechanical and emergency (including rehabilitation) assistance to governments for clearly defined purposes linked to the results framework, as well as direct support to FAO's core work. The voluntary contributions are expected to reach approximately US$1.6 billion in 2016\u20132017.\n\nThis overall budget covers core technical work, cooperation and partnerships, leading to Food and Agriculture Outcomes at 71 per cent; Core Functions at 11 per cent; the Country Office Network \u2013 5 per cent; Capital and Security Expenditure \u2013 2 per cent; Administration \u2013 6 per cent; and Technical and Cooperation Program \u2013 5 per cent.\n\n===Directors-General===\n[[File:Jose graziano.jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva]], FAO Director-General]]\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" \n!Nr\n!Director \n!Country\n!Term\n\n|- \n| 9 || [[Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva]] ||  {{BRA}}|| January 2012 \u2013 present\n|- \n| 8 || [[Jacques Diouf]] || {{SEN}} || January 1994 \u2013 December 2011 \n|- \n| 7 || [[Edouard Saouma]] ||  {{LBN}}|| January 1976 \u2013 December 1993 \n|- \n| 6 || Addeke Hendrik Boerma ||  {{NLD}} || January 1968 \u2013 December 1975 \n|- \n| 5 || [[Binay Ranjan Sen]] ||  {{IND}}|| November 1956 \u2013 December 1967 \n|- \n| 4 || [[Herbert Broadley|Sir Herbert Broadley]] || {{GBR}} || acting April 1956 \u2013 November 1956 \n|- \n| 3 || [[Philip V.

The main aims of the programme are protecting consumer health, ensuring fair trade and promoting co-ordination of all food standards work undertaken by intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations.\n\n==== World Food Summit ====\n{{Main|World Food Summit}}\n\nIn 1996, FAO organized the [[World Food Summit]], attended by 112 Heads or Deputy Heads of State and Government. The Summit concluded with the signing of the [[Rome Declaration on World Food Security|Rome Declaration]], which established the goal of halving the number of people who suffer from hunger by the year 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/wfs/index_en.htm |title=World Food Summit archive, FAO |website=fao.org |accessdate=15 October 2010}}</ref> At the same time, 1,200 civil society organizations (CSOs) from 80 countries participated in an [[NGO]] forum. The forum was critical of the growing industrialization of agriculture and called upon governments \u2013 and FAO \u2013 to do more to protect the 'Right to Food' of the poor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/pro-cn.htm |title=''Profit for few or food for all'', Final Statement of the NGO Forum |year=1996}}</ref>\n\n==== TeleFood ====\nIn 1997, FAO launched TeleFood, a campaign of concerts, sporting events and other activities to harness the power of media, celebrities and concerned citizens to help fight hunger. Since its start, the campaign has generated close to US$28 million, \u20ac15 million in donations. Money raised through TeleFood pays for small, sustainable projects that help small-scale farmers produce more food for their families and communities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/english/newsroom/action/facts_tf_silos.htm |title=About FAO's TeleFood campaign |website=fao.org |access-date=2016-10-10}}</ref>\n\nThe projects provide tangible resources, such as fishing equipment, seeds and agricultural implements. They vary enormously, from helping families raise pigs in Venezuela, through creating school gardens in Cape Verde and Mauritania or providing school lunches in Uganda and teaching children to grow food, to raising fish in a leper community in India.\n\n==== FAO Goodwill Ambassadors ====\nThe [[FAO Goodwill Ambassador]]s Programme was initiated in 1999. The main purpose of the programme is to attract public and media attention to the unacceptable situation that some 1 billion people continue to suffer from chronic hunger and malnutrition in a time of unprecedented plenty. These people lead a life of misery and are denied the most basic of human rights: the right to food.\n\nGovernments alone cannot end hunger and undernourishment. Mobilization of the public and private sectors, the involvement of civil society and the pooling of collective and individual resources are all needed if people are to break out of the vicious circle of chronic hunger and undernourishment.\n\nEach of FAO's Goodwill Ambassadors \u2013 celebrities from the arts, entertainment, sport and academia such as Nobel Prize winner [[Rita Levi Montalcini]], actress [[Gong Li]], the late singer [[Miriam Makeba]], International Singers [[Ronan Keating]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/ambassadors/ambassadors/ambassadors-ronankeating/en/ |title=Get Involved: Ronan Keating |website=fao.org |accessdate=8 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515054032/http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/ambassadors/ambassadors/ambassadors-ronankeating/en/ |archivedate=15 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Anggun]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/ambassadors/ambassadors/ambassadors-anggun/en/ |title=Get Involved: Anggun |website=fao.org |accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> and soccer players [[Roberto Baggio]] and [[Ra\u00fal Gonz\u00e1lez|Ra\u00fal]], to name a few \u2013 have made a personal and professional commitment to FAO's vision: a food-secure world for present and future generations.

Through projects in over 100 countries worldwide, the programme promotes effective, tangible solutions to the elimination of hunger, undernourishment and poverty. Currently 102 countries are engaged in the programme and of these approximately 30 have begun shifting from pilot to national programmes. To maximize the impact of its work, FAO strongly promotes national ownership and local empowerment in the countries in which it operates.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n==== Online campaign against hunger ====\nThe 1billionhungry project became the EndingHunger campaign in April 2011. Spearheaded by FAO in partnership with other UN agencies and private nonprofit groups, the EndingHunger movement pushes the boundaries of conventional public advocacy. It builds on the success in 2010 of The 1billonhungry project and the subsequent chain of public events that led to the collection of over three million signatures on a global petition to end hunger (www.EndingHunger.org). The petition was originally presented to representatives of world governments at a ceremony in Rome on 30 November 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edu-lib.us/westernfarmpress.com/government/1billionhungry-project-petition-presented-world-leaders |title=1billionhungry project petition presented to world leaders |publisher=Westerfarmpress.com |date=30 November 2010 |accessdate=9 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923233814/http://www.edu-lib.us/westernfarmpress.com/government/1billionhungry-project-petition-presented-world-leaders |archive-date=23 September 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe web and partnerships are two pivotal and dynamic aspects of EndingHunger. The campaign relies on the assistance of organizations and institutions that can facilitate the project's diffusion, by placing banners on their own websites or organizing events aimed to raise awareness of the project. In its 2011 season, the campaign expanded its multimedia content, pursued mutual visibility arrangements with partner organizations, and sharpened its focus on 14- to 25-year-olds, who were encouraged to understand their potential as a social movement to push for the end of hunger.\n\nMoreover, the EndingHunger project is a viral communication campaign, renewing and expanding its efforts to build the movement through Facebook, Twitter and other social networks. Those who sign the petition can spread the link of the EndingHunger website to their friends, via social media or mail, in order to gain awareness and signatures for the petition. The next interim objective is to grow the EndingHunger movement's Facebook community to 1 million members. As with the petition, the more people who get involved, the more powerful the message to governments: \"We are no longer willing to accept the fact that hundreds of millions live in chronic hunger.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.endinghunger.org/ |title=EndingHunger |accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref> Groups and individuals can also decide on their own to organize an event about the project, simply by gathering friends, whistles, T-shirts and banners (whistles and T-shirts can be ordered, and petition sign sheets downloaded, on the endinghunger.org website) and thereby alert people about chronic hunger by using the yellow whistle.\n\nThe original 1billionhungry campaign borrowed as its slogan the line \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\", used by [[Peter Finch]] in the 1976 film, ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]''.<ref>{{cite video|people=Chayefsky, Paddy and Lumet, Sidney (Director)|date=1976|title=Network|medium=Motion picture|location=United States|publisher=Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, United Artists}}</ref> Meanwhile, the yellow whistle has been the campaign symbol from the start, from 1billionhungry to Ending Hunger. (The creative concept was provided by the McCann Erickson Italy Communication Agency.) It symbolizes the fact that we are \"blowing the whistle\" on the silent disaster of hunger. It is both a symbol and \u2013 at many live events taking place around the world \u2013 a physical means of expressing frustration and making some noise about the hunger situation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ahgingos.org/documents/.../1BH--background_document.doc |title=The 1billionhungry project |publisher=AD HOC Group of INGOs |format=DOC |accessdate=9 January 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nBoth The 1billionhungry and the EndingHunger campaigns have continued to attract UN Goodwill Ambassadors from the worlds of music and cinema, literature, sport, activism and government. Some of the well known individuals who have become involved include former Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, former presidents of Chile Ricardo Lagos and Michelle Bachelet, actress Susan Sarandon, actors Jeremy Irons and Raul Bova, singers [[C\u00e9line Dion]] and [[Anggun]], authors Isabelle Allende and Andrea Camilleri, musician Chucho Vald\u00e9s and Olympic track-and-field legend Carl Lewis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/42158/icode/ |title=FAO launches anti-hunger petition |website=fao.org |date=11 May 2010 |accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\n==== International Plant Protection Convention ====\nFAO created the [[International Plant Protection Convention]] or IPPC in 1952. This international treaty organization works to prevent the international spread of pests and plant diseases in both cultivated and wild plants. Among its functions are the maintenance of lists of plant pests, tracking of pest outbreaks, and coordination of technical assistance between member nations. As of July 2018, 183 contracting parties have ratified the treaty.\n\n==== Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition ====\n{{Redirect|AAHM|the American society dedicated to [[medical history]]|American Association for the History of Medicine}}\nThe Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition (AAHM)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaahm.org/ |title=theaahm.org |website=theaahm.org|accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> aims to address how countries and organizations can be more effective in advocating and carrying out actions to address hunger and malnutrition. As a global partnership, AAHM creates global connections between local, regional, national and international institutions that share the goals of fighting hunger and malnutrition. The organization works to address food security by enhancing resources and knowledge sharing and strengthening hunger activities within countries and across state lines at the regional and international levels.\n\nFollowing the World Food Summit, the Alliance was initially created in 2002 as the 'International Alliance Against Hunger (IAAH)' to strengthen and coordinate national efforts in the fight against hunger and malnutrition. The mission of the Alliance originates from the first and eight UN Millennium Development Goals; reducing the number of people that suffer from hunger in half by 2015 (preceded by the \"Rome Declaration\" in 1996) and developing a global partnership for development. The Alliance was founded by the Rome-based food agencies \u2013 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/ |title=fao.org |accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> UN World Food Programme (WFP),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wfp.org/ |title=wfp.org |accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifad.org/ |title=ifad.org |accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> \u2013 and Bioversity International.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bioversityinternational.org/ |title=bioversityinternational.org |accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nAAHM connects top-down and bottom-up anti-hunger development initiatives, linking governments, UN organizations, and NGOs together in order to increase effectiveness through unity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaahm.org/ |title=Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition |publisher=theaahm.org |date=17 March 2011 |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Integrated pest management ====\nDuring the 1990s, FAO took a leading role in the promotion of [[integrated pest management]] for rice production in Asia. Hundreds of thousands of farmers were trained using an approach known as the [[Farmer Field School (FFS)]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comunityipm.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312052945/http://www.comunityipm.org/ |archive-date=12 March 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Like many of the programmes managed by FAO, the funds for Farmer Field Schools came from bilateral Trust Funds, with Australia, Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland acting as the leading donors. FAO's efforts in this area have drawn praise from NGOs that have otherwise criticized much of the work of the organization.\n\n==== Transboundary pests and diseases ====\nFAO established an ''Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases'' in 1994, focusing on the control of diseases like [[rinderpest]], [[foot-and-mouth disease]] and [[avian flu]] by helping governments coordinate their responses. One key element is the ''Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme'', which has advanced to a stage where large tracts of Asia and Africa have now been free of the cattle disease rinderpest for an extended period of time. Meanwhile, ''Locust Watch'' monitors the worldwide locust situation and keeps affected countries and donors informed of expected developments.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n==== Global Partnership Initiative for Plant Breeding Capacity Building ====\n[[File:FAO Food Price Index.png|The Food Price Index (FAO) 1990-2012|thumb|right]]\n\nThe Global Partnership Initiative for Plant Breeding Capacity Building (GIPB) is a global partnership dedicated to increasing plant breeding capacity building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://km.fao.org/gipb/about-gipb/who-we-are/en/ |title=About GIPB |publisher=FAO |accessdate=3 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414233309/http://km.fao.org/gipb/about-gipb/who-we-are/en/ |archivedate=14 April 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The mission of GIPB is to enhance the capacity of developing countries to improve crops for food security and sustainable development through better plant breeding and delivery systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://km.fao.org/gipb/about-gipb/objectives/en/ |title=Objectives |publisher=FAO |accessdate=3 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414162813/http://km.fao.org/gipb/about-gipb/objectives/en/ |archivedate=14 April 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The ultimate goal is to ensure that a critical mass of plant breeders, leaders, managers and technicians, donors and partners are linked together through an effective global network.\n\nIncreasing capacity building for plant breeding in developing countries is critical for the achievement of meaningful results in poverty and hunger reduction and to reverse the current worrisome trends. Plant breeding is a well recognized science capable of widening the genetic and adaptability base of cropping systems, by combining conventional selection techniques and modern technologies. It is essential to face and prevent the recurrence of crises such as that\nof the soaring food prices and to respond to the increasing demands for crop based sources of energy.\n\n==== Investment in agriculture ====\nFAO's technical cooperation department hosts an Investment Centre that promotes greater investment in agriculture and rural development by helping developing countries identify and formulate sustainable agricultural policies, programmes and projects. It mobilizes funding from multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, regional development banks and international funds as well as FAO resources.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/tc/about_en.asp |title=About FAO |publisher=FAO |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) ====\n\nThe Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) Partnership Initiative was conceptualized and presented by Parviz Koohafkan the Task Manager of Chapter 10 of Agenda 21 in Food and Agricultural Organization of United Nations, FAO in 2002 during World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}  This UN Partnership Initiative aims to identify, support and safeguard Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems and their livelihoods, agricultural and associated biodiversity, landscapes, knowledge systems and cultures around the world. The GIAHS Partnership recognizes the crucial importance of the well-being of family farming communities in an integrated approach while directing activities towards sustainable agriculture and rural development.\n\n====Animal Genetic Resources====\nFAO has a unit focused on [[Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|Animal Genetic Resources]], which are defined as \u201cthose animal species that are used, or may be used, for the production of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them. These populations within each species can be classified as wild and feral populations, landraces and primary populations, standardised breeds, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds.\"<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-y1100m/y1100m03.htm |title=Annex 2: Working Definitions for Use in Developing Country Reports and Providing Supporting Data |journal=Animal Genetics Resources Information: Special Issue State of the World |volume=30 |year=2001 |pages=35\u201340 |via=Web |access-date=19 May 2016 |publisher=FAO}}</ref> FAO assists countries in implementation of the [[Global plan of action for animal genetic resources|Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources]].

The ''Forestry Department'' <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/en/ |title=Forestry |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |website=www.fao.org}}</ref> works to balance social and environmental considerations with the economic needs of rural populations living in forest areas. FAO serves as a neutral forum for policy dialogue, as a reliable source of information on forests and trees and as a provider of expert technical assistance and advice to help countries develop and implement effective national forest programmes.\n\nFAO is both a global clearinghouse for information on [[forest]]s and forest resources and a facilitator that helps build countries' local capacity to provide their own national forest data. In collaboration with member countries, FAO carries out periodic global assessments of forest resources, which are made available through reports, publications and the FAO's Web site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/index_en.htm |title=Home |website=www.fao.org |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}</ref> The ''[[Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA)|Global Forest Resources Assessment]]'' <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/en/|title=Global Forest Resources Assessments |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |website=www.fao.org}}</ref> provides comprehensive reporting on forests worldwide every five years.

Headquarters restructuring and delegation of decision making created a flatter more responsive structure and reduced costs. Modernizing and streamlining of administrative and operational processes took place. Improved internal teamwork and closer external partnerships coupled with upgrading of IT infrastructure and greater autonomy of FAO's decentralized offices now allows the Organization to respond quickly where needs are greatest. As FAO is primarily a knowledge based organization, investing in human resources is a top priority. Capacity building including a leadership programme, employee rotation and a new junior professional programme were established. Individual performance management, an ethics and ombudsman officer and an independent office of evaluation were designed to improve performance through learning and strengthened oversight.\n\nIn January 2012, the Director-General [[Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva]] acted upon the commitment made during his campaign to bring the FAO reform to a successful and anticipated completion.

Subsequently, he worked all his life at the experimental psychiatric clinic of [[La Borde clinic|La Borde]] under the direction of Lacan's pupil, the psychiatrist [[Jean Oury]]. La Borde was a venue for conversation among many students of philosophy, psychology, ethnology, and [[social work]].\n\nOne particularly novel orientation developed at La Borde consisted of the suspension of the classical analyst/analysand pair in favour of an open confrontation in [[Group psychotherapy|group therapy]]. In contrast to the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] school's individualistic style of [[Psychoanalysis|analysis]], this practice studied the dynamics of several subjects in complex interaction; it led Guattari into a broader philosophical exploration of, and political engagement with, a vast array of intellectual and cultural domains ([[philosophy]], [[ethnology]], [[linguistics]], [[architecture]], etc.).\n\n===1960s to 1970s===\n\nFrom 1955 to 1965, Guattari edited and contributed to ''La Voie Communiste'' (''Communist Way''), a [[Trotskyist]] newspaper.<ref>Guattari (1989, x).</ref> He supported [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialist]] struggles as well as the Italian [[Autonomia Operaia|Autonomists]]. Guattari also took part in the G.T.P.S.I., which gathered many psychiatrists at the beginning of the sixties and created the Association of Institutional Psychotherapy in November 1965. It was at the same time that he founded, along with other militants, the F.G.E.R.I. (Federation of Groups for Institutional Study & Research) and its review ''Recherche'' (''Research''), working on philosophy, mathematics, psychoanalysis, education, architecture, ethnology, etc. The F.G.E.R.I. came to represent aspects of the multiple political and cultural engagements of Guattari: the Group for Young Hispanics, the Franco-Chinese Friendships (in the times of the people's communes), the opposition activities with the wars in [[Algerian War of Independence|Algeria]] and Vietnam, the participation in the M.N.E.F., with the U.N.E.F., the policy of the offices of psychological academic aid (B.A.P.U.), the organisation of the University Working Groups (G.T.U.), but also the reorganizations of the training courses with the Centers of Training to the Methods of Education Activities (C.E.M.E.A.) for psychiatric male nurses, as well as the formation of Friendly Male Nurses (Amicales d'infirmiers) (in 1958), the studies on architecture and the projects of construction of a day hospital for \"students and young workers\".\n\nIn 1967, he appeared as one of the founders of OSARLA (Organization of solidarity and Aid to the Latin-American Revolution). In 1968, Guattari met [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], [[Jean-Jacques Lebel]], and [[Julian Beck]]. He was involved in the large-scale [[May 1968 in France|French protests of 1968]], starting from the [[Movement of March 22]]. It was in the aftermath of 1968 that Guattari met [[Gilles Deleuze]] at the [[University of Vincennes]] and began to lay the ground-work for the soon to be infamous ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), which [[Michel Foucault]] described as \"an introduction to the non-fascist life\" in his preface to the book. In 1970, he created {{ill|Center for the Study and Research of Institutional Formation|fr|CERFI}}), which developed the approach explored in the ''Recherches'' journal. In 1973, Guattari was tried and fined for committing an \"outrage to public decency\" for publishing an issue of ''Recherches'' on homosexuality.<ref>{{cite book |author=Massumi, Brian |title=A User's Guide to Capitalism and Schizophrenia: Deviations from Deleuze and Guattari |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1993 |page=144 |isbn=0-262-63143-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> In 1977, he created the CINEL for \"new spaces of freedom\" before joining in the 1980s the [[ecological]] movement with his \"[[ecosophy]]\".\n\n===1980s to 1990s===\nIn his last book, ''Chaosmosis'' (1992), Guattari returned to the question of subjectivity: \"How to produce it, collect it, enrich it, reinvent it permanently in order to make it compatible with mutant Universes of value?\" This concern runs through all of his works, from ''Psychoanalysis and Transversality'' (a collection of articles from 1957 to 1972), through ''Years of Winter'' (1980\u20131986) and ''Schizoanalytic Cartographies'' (1989), to his collaboration with Deleuze, ''[[What is Philosophy? (Deleuze and Guattari)|What is Philosophy?]]'' (1991). In ''Chaosmosis'', Guattari proposes an analysis of subjectivity in terms of four dimensions: (1) material, energetic, and semiotic fluxes; (2) concrete and abstract machinic [[phylum|phyla]]; (3) [[Virtual (philosophy)|virtual]] universes of value; and (4) finite existential territories.<ref>Guattari (1992, 124).</ref> This scheme attempts to grasp the heterogeneity of components involved in the production of subjectivity, as Guattari understands it, which include both signifying [[Semiotics|semiotic]] components as well as \"a-signifying [[semiology|semiological]] dimensions\" (which work \"in parallel or independently of\" any signifying function that they may have).<ref>Guattari (1992, 4).</ref>\n\nOn 29 August 1992, two weeks after an interview for Greek television, curated by [[Yiorgos Veltsos]],<ref>\"[http://www.revue-chimeres.fr/drupal_chimeres/?q=node/267 Entretien avec F\u00e9lix Guattari \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision grecque]\" (\"Felix Guattari interview on Greek television\"), ''Revue Chim\u00e8res'', 4 February 2009 (in [[French language|French]])</ref> Guattari died in [[La Borde clinic|La Borde]] from a [[heart attack]].<ref name=kirkup>\"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-felix-guattari-1548642.html Obituary: Felix Guattari]\" by [[James Kirkup]], ''[[The Independent]]'', 31 August 1992</ref><ref name=riding>\"[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/03/arts/felix-guattari-a-psychoanalyst-and-philospher-is-dead-at-62.html Felix Guattari, a Psychoanalyst And Philospher, &#91;sic&#93; Is Dead at 62]\" by [[Alan Riding]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 3 September 1992</ref> Some three years later, on 4 November 1995, his friend and research partner [[Gilles Deleuze]], chronically suffering from respiratory ailments and incapable of simple tasks such as writing,<ref name=dosse>Fran\u00e7ois Dosse, ''Deleuze and Guattari: Intersecting Lives'', trans D.

The Latin term ''Filioque'' describes the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]] as proceeding from both the Father and the Son, (and not from the Father only). In the Nicene Creed it is translated by the English phrase \"and {{interp|from}} the Son\"{{refn|{{OED|filioque, n|70207}}}}:\n:{{gray|I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord, the giver of life,}}\n:who proceedeth from the Father {{strong|{{Angle bracket|and the Son}}}}.\n:{{gray|Who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified.}}\n\nor in Latin:\n:{{gray|Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et vivificantem:}}\n:qui ex Patre {{strong|{{Angle bracket|Filioque}} procedit}}\n:{{gray|Qui cum Patre, et Filio simul adoratur, et cum glorificatur.}}\n\nWhether that term ''Filioque'' is included, as well as how it is translated and understood, can have important implications for how one understands the doctrine of the [[Holy Trinity]], which is central to the majority of Christian churches. For some, the term implies a serious underestimation of [[God the Father|the Father]]'s role in the Trinity; for others, denial of what it expresses implies a serious underestimation of the role of [[God the Son|the Son]] in the Trinity. Over time, the term became a symbol of conflict between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, although there have been attempts at resolving the conflict. Among the early attempts at harmonization are the works of [[Maximus the Confessor]], who notably was canonised independently by both Eastern and Western churches.\n\nThe ''Filioque'' is included in the form of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed used in most Western Christian churches, first appearing in the 6th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grudem|first=Wanye|year=1994|title=Systematic Theology|location=Grand Rapids, MI|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-31028670-7|page=246|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2DUPWk9ng3wC&pg=PA246}}</ref>{{contradict-inline|reason=Other sources on the page date earliest example to 410|date=November 2015}} It was accepted by the [[pope]]s only in 1014 and is rejected by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] and [[Church of the East]]. It is not in the original text of this Creed, attributed to the [[second ecumenical council]], Constantinople I (381), which says that the [[Holy Spirit]] proceeds \"from the Father\", without additions of any kind, such as \"and the Son\" or \"alone\";{{sfn|RCA|2002|p=70}} the Latin text now in use in most Western Churches speaks of the Holy Spirit as proceeding \"from the Father ''and the Son''\".\n\nDifferences over this doctrine and the question of [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|papal primacy]] have been and remain primary causes of schism between the Eastern Orthodox and Western churches.{{sfn|Larchet|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|WCCFO|1979}} The term has been an ongoing source of conflict between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, contributing, in major part, to the [[East\u2013West Schism]] of 1054 and proving to be an obstacle to attempts to reunify the two sides.{{sfnm|Congar|1959|1p=44|Meyendorff|1987|2p=181|NAOCTC|2003}}\n\n==Controversy==\nThe controversy referring to the term ''Filioque'' involves four separate disagreements:\n*about the term itself\n*about the orthodoxy of the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, to which the term refers\n*about the legitimacy of inserting the term into the  Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed,\n*about the authority of the pope to define the orthodoxy of the doctrine or to insert the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed.\nAlthough the disagreement about the doctrine preceded the disagreement about the insertion into the creed, the two disagreements became linked to the third when the pope approved insertion of the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, in the 11th century. Siecienski writes that \"Ultimately what was at stake was not only God's trinitarian nature, but also the nature of the Church, its teaching authority and the distribution of power among its leaders.\"{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=4\u20135}}\n\n[[Hubert Cunliffe-Jones]] identifies two opposing Eastern Orthodox opinions about the ''Filioque'': a \"liberal\" view and a \"rigorist\" view. The \"liberal\" view sees the controversy as being largely a matter of mutual miscommunication and misunderstanding. In this view, both East and West are at fault for failing to allow for a \"plurality of theologies\". Each side went astray in considering their theological framework as the only one that was doctrinally valid and applicable. Thus, neither side would accept that the dispute was not so much about conflicting dogmas as it was about different ''[[theologoumenon|theologoumena]]'' or theological perspectives. While all Christians must be in agreement on questions of dogma, there is room for diversity in theological approaches.{{sfn|Cunliffe-Jones|2006|pp=208\u2013209}}\n\nHowever, this \"liberal\" view is vehemently opposed by those Eastern Orthodox whom Cunliffe-Jones identifies as holding a \"rigorist\" view. According to standard Eastern Orthodox position, as pronounced by Photius, [[Mark of Ephesus]] and 20th century Eastern Orthodox theologians such as [[Vladimir Lossky]], the ''Filioque'' question hinges on fundamental issues of dogma and cannot be dismissed as simply one of different ''theologoumena''. Many in the \"rigorist\" camp consider the ''Filioque'' to have resulted in the role of the Holy Spirit being underestimated by the Western Church and thus leading to serious doctrinal error.{{sfn|Cunliffe-Jones|2006|pp=208\u2013209}}\n\nIn a similar vein, Siecienski comments that, although it was common in the 20th century to view the ''Filioque'' as just another weapon in the power struggle between Rome and Constantinople and although this was occasionally the case, for many involved in the dispute, the theological issues outweighed by far the ecclesiological concerns. According to Siecienski, the deeper question was perhaps whether Eastern and Western Christianity had wound up developing \"differing and ultimately incompatible teachings about the nature of God\". Moreover, Siecienski asserts that the question of whether the teachings of East and West were truly incompatible became almost secondary to the fact that, starting around the 8th or 9th century, Christians on both sides of the dispute began to believe that the differences ''were'' irreconcilable.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=4\u20136}}\n\nFrom the view of the West, the Eastern rejection of the ''Filioque'' denied the [[consubstantiality]] of the Father and the Son and was thus a form of crypto-[[Arianism]]. In the East, the interpolation of the ''Filioque'' seemed to many to be an indication that the West was teaching a \"substantially different faith\". Siecienski asserts that, as much as power and authority were central issues in the debate, the strength of emotion rising even to the level of hatred can be ascribed to a belief that the other side had \"destroyed the purity of the faith and refused to accept the clear teachings of the fathers on the Spirit's procession\".{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=4\u20136}}\n\n==History==\n{{main article|History of the Filioque controversy}}\n\n===New Testament===\n\nIn {{bibleverse||John|15:26}} Jesus says of the Holy Spirit: \"But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.\"\n\nIn {{bibleverse||John|16:13\u201315}} Jesus says of the Holy Spirit: \"he will ''take'' what is mine and declare it to you\", and it is argued that in the relations between the Persons of the [[Trinity]] one Person cannot \"take\" or \"receive\" ({{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03c8\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9}}) anything from either of the others except by way of procession.{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Double Procession of the Holy Spirit\"}} Texts such as {{bibleverse||John|20:22}} (\"He breathed on them and said: Receive the Holy Spirit\"), were seen by Fathers of the Church, especially [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], [[Cyril of Alexandria]] and [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] as grounds for saying that the Spirit \"proceeds substantially from both\" the Father and the Son.{{refn|Maximus the Confessor, ''Letter to Marinus'' (PG 91:136), cited in {{harvtxt|Meyendorff|1987|p=93}}}} Other texts that have been used include {{bibleverse||Galatians|4:6}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|8:9}}, {{bibleverse||Philippians|1:19}}, where the Holy Spirit is called \"the Spirit of the Son\", \"the Spirit of Christ\", \"the Spirit of Jesus Christ\", and texts in the [[Gospel of John]] on the sending of the Holy Spirit by Jesus ({{bibleverse-nb||John|14:16}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|15:26}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|16:7}}).{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Double Procession of the Holy Spirit\"}} {{bibleverse||Revelation|22:1}} (possibly written by John, who identifies the Water of Life as the Holy Spirit in {{bibleverse||John|7:39}}) states that the river of the Water of Life in Heaven is \"flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb\" (the Lamb is Christ, cf. {{bibleverse||John|1:29}}), which may be interpreted as the Holy Spirit proceeding from both the Father and the Son.\n\nSiecienski asserts that \"the New Testament does not explicitly address the procession of the Holy Spirit as later theology would understand the doctrine\", although there are \"certain principles established in the New Testament that shaped later Trinitarian theology, and particular texts that both Latins and Greeks exploited to support their respective positions vis-\u00e0-vis the ''Filioque''\".{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=17}} In contrast, [[Veli-Matti K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen]] says that Eastern Orthodox believe that the absence of an explicit mention of the double procession of the Holy Spirit is a strong indication that the ''Filioque'' is a theologically erroneous doctrine.{{sfn|K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen|2010|p=276}}\n\n===Church fathers===\n\n====Cappadocian Fathers====\n{{see also|Cappadocian Fathers}}\n[[Basil of Caesarea]] wrote: \"Through the one Son (the Holy

Siecienski says that, in view of the widespread acceptance by then that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, it would be strange if Gregory did not advocate the teaching, \"even if he did not understand the ''filioque'' as later Latin theology would \u2014 that is, in terms of a 'double procession'.\"{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=70\u201371}}\n\n===\"From the Father through the Son\"===\nChurch Fathers also use the phrase \"from the Father through the Son\".{{refn|name=TertullianAdversusPraxea4}}{{refn|John of Damascus, ''Expositio Fidei'' 1.12 ([[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume IX/John of Damascus/An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith/Book I/Chapter 12|NFPF2 9:15]])}} Cyril of Alexandria, who undeniably several times states that the Holy Spirit issues from the Father ''and'' the Son, also speaks of the Holy Spirit coming from the Father ''through'' the Son, two different expressions that for him are complementary: the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father does not exclude the Son's mediation and the Son receives from the Father a participation in the Holy Spirit's coming.{{sfn|Boulnois|2003|pp=106\u2013108}}{{efn|{{harvtxt|Boulnois|2003|pp=106\u2013107}} notes that some ascribe an opinion about the ''Filioque'' to Cyril of Alexandria by \"quotations grouped in anthologies\" without analysis or context.

Among the Church leaders in Frankish Kingdom of that time a notion was developing that Filioque clause was in fact an authentic part of the original Creed.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=92}} Trying to deal with that problem and its potentially dangerous consequences, the Church of Rome found itself in the middle of a widening rift between its own Daughter-Church in Frankish Kingdom and Sister-Churches of the East. Popes of that time, [[Pope Hadrian I|Hadrian I]] and [[Pope Leo III|Leo III]], had to face various challenges while trying to find solutions that would preserve the unity of the Church.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|p=38}}\n\nFirst signs of the problems were starting to show by the end of the reign of Frankish king [[Pepin the Short]] (751-768). Use of the ''Filioque'' clause in the Frankish Kingdom led to controversy with envoys of the Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] at the Synod of Gentilly (767).{{sfn|Maas|1909}}{{sfn|Hinson|1995|p=315}}{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=90}} As the practice of chanting the interpolated Latin ''{{lang|la|Credo}}'' at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] spread in the West, the ''Filioque'' became a part of the [[Latin Rite]] liturgy throughout the Frankish Kingdom. The practice of chanting the Creed was adopted in Charlemagne's court by the end of the 8th century and spread through all of his realms, including some northern parts of Italy, but not to Rome, where its use was not accepted until 1014.{{sfn|Dix|2005|pp=485\u2013488}}{{sfn|Louth|2007|p=142}}\n\nSerious problems erupted in 787 after the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] when Charlemagne accused the Patriarch [[Tarasios of Constantinople]] of infidelity to the faith of the First Council of Nicaea, allegedly because he had not professed the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father \"and the Son\", but only \"through the Son\". Pope Hadrian rejected those accusations and tried to explain to the Frankish king that pneumatology of Tarasios was in accordance with the teachings of the holy Fathers.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=237}}{{efn|Charlemagne's legates claimed that Tarasius, at his installation, did not follow the Nicene faith and profess that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, but confessed rather his procession from the Father ''through the Son'' (Mansi 13.760). The Pope strongly rejected Charlemagne's protest, showing at length that Tarasius and the Council, on this and other points, maintained the faith of the Fathers (ibid. 759\u2013810).}} Surprisingly, efforts of the pope had no effect.\n\nTrue scale of the problem became evident during the following years. The Frankish view of the ''Filioque'' was emphasized again in the ''[[Libri Carolini]]'', composed around 791-793.{{efn|Following this exchange of letters with the pope, Charlemagne commissioned the ''Libri Carolini'' (791\u2013793) to challenge the positions both of the iconoclast council of 754 and of the Council of Nicaea of 787 on the veneration of icons. Again because of poor translations, the Carolingians misunderstood the actual decision of the latter Council.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}}} Openly arguing that the word ''Filioque'' was part of the Creed of 381, the authors of ''Libri Carolini'' demonstrated not only the surprising lack of basic knowledge but also the lack of will to receive right advice and council from the Mother-Church in Rome. Frankish theologians reaffirmed the notion that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, and rejected as inadequate the teaching that the Spirit proceeds from the Father ''through the Son''.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91-93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=237}} That claim was both erroneous and dangerous for the preservation of the unity of the Church.\n\nIn those days, another theological problem appeared to be closely connected with the use of Filioque in the West. In the late 8th century, a controversy arose between Bishop [[Elipandus of Toledo]] and [[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]] over the former's teaching (which has been called [[Spanish Adoptionism]]) that Christ in his humanity was the adoptive son of God. Elipandus was supported by Bishop [[Felix of Urgel]]. In 785, Pope Hadrian I condemned the teaching of Elipandus. In 791, Felix appealed to Charlemagne in defense of the Spanish Adoptionist teaching, sending him a tract outlining it. He was condemned at the Synod of Regensburg (792) and was sent to Pope Hadrian in Rome, where he made of profession of orthodox faith, but returned to Spain and there reaffirmed Adoptionism. Elipandus wrote to the bishops of the territories controlled by Charlemagne in defence of his teaching, which was condemned at the [[Council of Frankfurt]] (794) and at the Synod of [[Friuli]] (796). The controversy encouraged those who rejected Adoptionism to introduce into the liturgy the use of the Creed, with the ''Filioque'', to profess belief that Christ was the Son from eternity, not adopted as a son at his baptism.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=93-94}}{{sfn|Dales|2013|pp=61\u201367}}\n\nAt the Synod of Friuli, [[Paulinus II of Aquileia]] stated that the insertion of ''Filioque'' in the 381 Creed of the [[First Council of Constantinople]] was no more a violation of the prohibition of new creeds than were the insertions into the 325 Creed of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] that were done by the First Council of Constantinople itself. What was forbidden, he said, was adding or removing something \"craftily ... contrary to the sacred intentions of the fathers\", not a council's addition that could be shown to be in line with the intentions of the Fathers and the faith of the ancient Church. Actions such as that of the First Council of Contantinople were sometimes called for in order to clarify the faith and do away with heresies that appear.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238}}{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=364}} The views of Paulinus show that some advocates of Filioque clause were quite aware of the fact that it actually was not part of the Creed.{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238}}\n\nPolitical events that followed additionally complicated the issue. According to [[John Meyendorff]],{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|pp=41\u201343, 195\u2013197}} and [[John Romanides]]<ref name=\"Romanides1\"/> the Frankish efforts to get new [[Pope Leo III]] to approve the addition of ''Filioque'' to the Creed were due to a desire of [[Charlemagne]], who in 800 had been crowned in Rome as Emperor, to find grounds for accusations of heresy against the East. The Pope's refusal to approve the interpolation of the ''Filioque'' into the Creed avoided arousing a conflict between East and West about this matter. During his reign ({{Reign|795|816|lk=abbr}}), and for another two centuries, there was no Creed at all in the [[Roman rite]] Mass.\n\nReasons for the continuing refusal of the Frankish Church to adopt the positions of the Church of Rome on necessity of leaving Filioque outside of Creed remained unknown. Faced with another endorsement of the Filioque clause at the Frankish [[Council of Aachen (809)]] pope Leo III denied his approval and publicly posted the Creed in Rome without the Filioque, written in Greek and Latin on two silver plaques, in defense of the Orthodox Faith (810) stating his opposition to the addition of the ''Filioque'' into the Creed.{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Filioque\"}}{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91-93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238-239}} Although Leo III did not disapprove the ''Filioque'' doctrine, the Pope strongly believed the clause should not be included into the Creed.{{sfn|Maas|1909}}{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Filioque\"}}{{efn|\"Leo III defended the Filioque outside the Creed.}} In spite of the efforts of the Church of Rome, the acceptance of the Filioque clause in the Creed of the Frankish Church proved to be irreversible.\n\nIn 808 or 809 apparent controversy arose in Jerusalem between the Greek monks of one monastery and the Frankish Benedictine monks of another: the Greeks reproached the latter for, among other things, singing the creed with the ''Filioque'' included.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|Schmaus|1975}}{{sfn|Harnack|1898|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma5.ii.ii.i.vi.iv.html ch. 6 \u00a72]}} In response, the theology of the ''Filioque'' was expressed in the 809 local [[Council of Aachen]].{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|Harnack|1898|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma5.ii.ii.i.vi.iv.html ch. 6 \u00a72]}}{{sfn|Bray|1983|p=121}}\n\n===Photian controversy===\nAround 860 the controversy over the ''Filioque'' broke out in the course of the disputes between Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople]] and [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople]].

Such arbitrary change of the creed is an expression of pride and lack of love for one's brethren in the faith. 'In order not to be regarded as a schism by the Church, Romanism was forced to ascribe to the bishop of Rome absolute infallibility.' In this way Catholicism broke away from the Church as a whole and became an organization based upon external authority. Its unity is similar to the unity of the state: it is not super-rational but rationalistic and legally formal. Rationalism has led to the doctrine of the works of superarogation, established a balance of duties and merits between God and man, weighing in the scales sins and prayers, trespasses and deeds of expiation; it adopted the idea of transferring one person's debts or credits to another and legalized the exchange of assumed merits; in short, it introduced into the sanctuary of faith the mechanism of a banking house.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Lossky|first=Nikolai|year=|orig-year=1951|title=History of Russian philosophy|others=Translated|location=New York|publisher=International Universities Press|oclc=258525325|page=37|url=}}</ref>{{Relevance inline|discuss=Khomyakov in Lossky|date=November 2015}}}} and that it is in flagrant contravention of the words of Christ in the Gospel, has been specifically condemned by the Orthodox Church, and remains a fundamental heretical teaching which divides East and West.\n\nRomanides too, while personally opposing the ''Filioque'', stated that Constantinople I was not ever interpreted \"as a condemnation\" of the doctrine \"outside the Creed, since it did not teach that the Son is 'cause' or 'co-cause' of the existence of the Holy Spirit.

The notion of \"cause\" seems to be of special significance and importance in the Greek Patristic argument concerning the Filioque.

In October 2003, the Consultation issued an agreed statement, ''The Filioque: a Church-dividing issue?'', which provides an extensive review of Scripture, history, and theology.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}} The recommendations include:\n\n#That all involved in such dialogue expressly recognize the limitations of our ability to make definitive assertions about the inner life of God.\n#That, in the future, because of the progress in mutual understanding that has come about in recent decades, Orthodox and Catholics refrain from labeling as heretical the traditions of the other side on the subject of the procession of the Holy Spirit.\n#That Orthodox and Catholic theologians distinguish more clearly between the divinity and hypostatic identity of the Holy Spirit (which is a received dogma of our Churches) and the manner of the Spirit's origin, which still awaits full and final ecumenical resolution.\n#That those engaged in dialogue on this issue distinguish, as far as possible, the theological issues of the origin of the Holy Spirit from the ecclesiological issues of primacy and doctrinal authority in the Church, even as we pursue both questions seriously, together.\n#That the theological dialogue between our Churches also give careful consideration to the status of later councils held in both our Churches after those seven generally received as ecumenical.\n#That the Catholic Church, as a consequence of the normative and irrevocable dogmatic value of the [[Nicene Creed#Niceno\u2013Constantinopolitan Creed|Creed of 381]], use the original Greek text alone in making translations of that Creed for catechetical and liturgical use.\n#That the Catholic Church, following a growing theological consensus, and in particular the statements made by [[Pope Paul VI]], declare that the condemnation made at the [[Second Council of Lyons]] (1274) of those \"who presume to deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son\" is no longer applicable.\n\nIn the judgment of the consultation, the question of the ''Filioque'' is no longer a \"Church-dividing\" issue, which would impede full reconciliation and full communion. It is for the bishops of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches to review this work and to make whatever decisions would be appropriate.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}\n\n==Summary==\nWhile the Filioque doctrine was traditional in the West, being declared dogmatically in 447 by Pope Leo I, the Pope whose ''Tome'' was approved at the [[Council of Chalcedon]],{{refn|Leo I Letter 28 ''to Flavian'' ([[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume XIV/The Fourth Ecumenical Council/The Tome of St. Leo|NPNF2 14:254\u2013258]]); {{CCC|247}}.}} its inclusion in the Creed appeared in the [[Arian controversy|anti-Arian]] situation of [[History of Spain#Visigothic Hispania (5th\u20138th centuries)|7th-century Spain]]. However, this dogma was never accepted in the East. The ''Filioque'', included in the Creed by certain anti-Arian councils in Spain,{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|p=37}} was a means to affirm the full divinity of the Son in relation to both the Father and the Spirit.{{sfn|Irvin|Sunquist|2001|p=340}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Episcopal Church.

According to Ware, many Orthodox (whatever may be the doctrine and practice of the Eastern Orthodox Church itself) hold that, in broad outline, to say the Spirit proceeds from the Father ''and'' the Son amounts to the same thing as to say that the Spirit proceeds from the Father ''through'' the Son, a view accepted also by the Greeks who signed the act of union at the Council of Florence.{{sfn|Ware|2006|p=208}} For others, such as Bolotov and his disciples, the ''Filioque'' can be considered a Western ''theologoumenon'', a theological opinion of [[Church Fathers]] that falls short of being a dogma.{{sfn|ECT|2005|loc=\"Filioque\"}}{{sfn|AOJDC|1984|loc=n. 45}} Bulgakov also stated: \"There is no dogma of the relation of the Holy Spirit to the Son and therefore particular opinions on this subject are not heresies but merely dogmatic hypotheses, which have been transformed into heresies by the schismatic spirit that has established itself in the Church and that eagerly exploits all sorts of liturgical and even cultural differences.\"{{sfn|Bulgakov|2004|p=148}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n*[[Social trinitarianism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{cite web|author=Anglican Communion.

Fiqh  expands and develops Shariah through interpretation (''[[ijtihad]]'') of the Quran and ''Sunnah'' by Islamic jurists (''[[ulama]]'')<ref name=vogel/> and is implemented by the rulings (''[[fatwa]]'') of jurists on questions presented to them. Thus, whereas ''sharia'' is considered immutable and infallible by Muslims, ''fiqh'' is considered fallible and changeable. ''Fiqh'' deals with the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam. In the modern era, there are four prominent schools (''[[madh'hab]]'') of ''fiqh'' within [[Sunni]] practice, plus two (or three) within [[Shi'a]] practice. A person trained in ''fiqh'' is known as a ''[[faq\u012bh]]'' (plural ''fuqaha'').<ref>Glasse, Cyril, ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', Altamira, 2001, p. 141</ref>\n\nFiguratively, ''fiqh'' means knowledge about Islamic legal rulings from their sources and deriving religious rulings from their sources necessitates the ''[[mujtahid]]'' (an individual who exercises ''ijtihad'') to have a deep understanding in the different discussions of jurisprudence. A ''faq\u012bh'' must look deep down into a matter and not suffice himself with just the apparent meaning, and a person who only knows the appearance of a matter is not qualified as a ''faq\u012bh''.<ref name=\"Fiqh\"/>\n\nThe studies of ''fiqh'', are traditionally divided into ''U\u1e63\u016bl al-fiqh'' ([[principles of Islamic jurisprudence]], lit. the roots of fiqh), the methods of legal interpretation and analysis; and ''Fur\u016b\u02bf al-fiqh'' (lit. the branches of fiqh), the elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}} ''Fur\u016b\u02bf al-fiqh'' is the product of the application of ''U\u1e63\u016bl al-fiqh'' and the total product of human efforts at understanding the divine will. A ''[[hukm]]'' (plural ''a\u1e25k\u0101m'') is a particular ruling in a given case.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word ''fiqh'' is an Arabic term meaning \"deep understanding\"<ref name=\"Modarresi\">{{cite book|author=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|authorlink=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|title=The Laws of Islam|date=26 March 2016|publisher=Enlight Press|isbn=978-0994240989|url=http://almodarresi.com/en/books/pdf/TheLawsofIslam.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2017|ref=Modarresi|language=English}}</ref>{{rp|470}} or \"full comprehension\". Technically it refers to the body of Islamic law extracted from detailed Islamic sources (which are studied in the [[principles of Islamic jurisprudence]]) and the process of gaining knowledge of Islam through jurisprudence. The historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] describes ''fiqh'' as \"knowledge of the rules of God which concern the actions of persons who own themselves connected to obey the law respecting what is required (''[[wajib]]''), sinful (''[[haraam]]''), recommended (''[[mustahab|mand\u016bb]]''), disapproved (''[[makr\u016bh]]'') or neutral (''[[mubah]]'')\".<ref>Levy (1957). p. 150.</ref> This definition is consistent amongst the jurists.\n\nIn [[Modern Standard Arabic]], ''fiqh'' has come to mean jurisprudence in general, be it Islamic or secular. It is thus possible to speak of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] as an expert in the [[common law]] ''fiqh'' of the [[United States]], or of [[Egypt]]ian legal scholar [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri]] as an expert in the civil law ''fiqh'' of Egypt.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|Sharia}}\n{{further information|Islamic economics in the world}}\n\nThe history of Islamic jurisprudence is \"customarily divided into eight periods\":<ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1>[[#MAEGIFLEP2006|El-Gamal, ''Islamic Finance'', 2006]]: pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n*the first period ending with the death of [[Muhammad]] in 11 AH.<ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/>\n*second period \"characterized by personal interpretations\" of the canon by the ''[[Sahabah]]'' or companions of Muhammad, lasting until 50 AH.<ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/>\n*from 50 AH until the early second century AH there was competition between a \"a traditionalist approach to jurisprudence\" in [[Hijaz|western Arabia]] where Islam was revealed and a \"rationalist approach in Iraq\".<ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/>\n*the \"golden age of classical Islamic jurisprudence\" from the \"early second to the mid-fourth century when the [[Madhhab#Amman Message|eight \"most significant\"]] schools of Sunni and [[Shia|Shi'i]] jurisprudence emerged.\"<ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/>\n*from the mid-fourth century to mid-seventh AH Islamic jurisprudence was \"limited to elaborations within the main juristic schools\".<ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/>\n*the \"dark age\" of Islamic jurisprudence stretched from the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad]] in the mid-seventh AH (1258 CE) to 1293 AH/1876 CE.\n*In 1293 AH (1876 CE) the Ottomans codified [[Hanafi]] jurisprudence in the ''[[Mecelle|Majallah el-Ahkam-i-Adliya]]''.

Aisha raised and taught her nephew [[Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]] after her brother [[Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]] was killed by the Syrians.\n\nQasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr's mother was from Ali's family and Qasim's daughter [[Farwah bint al-Qasim]] was married to [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] and was the mother of [[Jafar al-Sadiq]]. Therefore, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was the grandson of [[Abu Bakr]] the first caliph and the grandfather of Jafar al-Sadiq whose views the twelver Shias follow. The twelver Shia do not accept Abu Bakr as the first caliph but do accept his great-great-grandson Jafar al-Sadiq.\n\nAisha also taught her nephew [[Urwah ibn Zubayr]]. He then taught his son [[Hisham ibn Urwah]], who was the main teacher of [[Malik ibn Anas]] whose views many Sunni follow and also taught Jafar al-Sadiq. Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, Hisham ibn Urwah and Muhammad al-Baqir taught [[Zayd ibn Ali]], Jafar al-Sadiq, [[Abu Hanifa]], and Malik ibn Anas.\n\nImam Jafar al-Sadiq, Imam Abu Hanifa and Malik ibn Anas worked together in [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] in Medina.

Imam Ahmad rejected the writing down and codifying of the religious rulings he gave. They knew that they might have fallen into error in some of their judgements and stated this clearly. They never introduced their rulings by saying, \"Here, this judgement is the judgement of God and His prophet.\"<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4OKaz5dzdYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Modernist+Islam,+1840-1940:+A+Sourcebook+By+Charles+Kurzman&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rYP-UKSOC4m70QXR54HYDA&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA|title=Modernist Islam, 1840\u20131940|publisher=}}</ref> There is also very little text actually written down by [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] himself. They all give priority to the Qur'an and the Hadith (the practice of Muhammad). They felt that the Quran and the Hadith, the example of Muhammad provided people with almost everything they needed. \"This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion\" Quran 5:3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quran.com/5/3 |title=Surat Al-Ma'idah [5:3] - The Noble Qur'an - \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0645 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925005700/http://quran.com/5/3 |archivedate=25 September 2013 |df=dmy }} [http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-5/verse-3/ Quran Surah Al-Maaida ( Verse 3 )]</ref>\n\nThese scholars did not distinguish between each other. They were not Sunni or Shia. They felt that they were following the religion of Abraham as described in the Quran \"Say: Allah speaks the truth; so follow the religion of Abraham, the upright one. And he was not one of the polytheists\" (Qur'an 3:95).\n\nMost of the differences are regarding Sharia laws devised through [[Ijtihad]] where there is no such ruling in the Quran or the Hadiths of [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] regarding a similar case.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\"/> As these jurists went to new areas, they were pragmatic and continued to use the same ruling as was given in that area during pre-Islamic times, if the population felt comfortable with it, it was just and they used [[Ijtihad]] to deduce that it did not conflict with the Quran or the Hadith. As explained in the [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]]<ref name=\"bewley.virtualave.net\"/> by [[Malik ibn Anas]].<ref name=\"Coulson\"/> This made it easier for the different communities to integrate into the Islamic State and assisted in the quick expansion of the Islamic State.\n\nTo reduce the divergence, [[ash-Shafi'i]] proposed giving priority to the Qur'an and the Hadith (the practice of Muhammad) and only then look at the consensus of the Muslim jurists (''[[ijma]]'') and analogical reasoning (''[[qiyas]]'').<ref name=\"Coulson\"/> This then resulted in jurists like [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]<ref name=\"sahih-bukhari.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sahih-bukhari.com/|title=Sahih Bukhari : Read, Study, Search Online|first=Sahih|last=Bukhari|publisher=}}</ref> dedicating their lives to the collection of the correct Hadith, in books like [[Sahih al-Bukhari]]. Sahih translates as authentic or correct. They also felt that Muhammad's judgement was more impartial and better than their own.\n\nThese original jurists and scholars also acted as a counterbalance to the rulers. When they saw injustice, all these scholars spoke out against it. As the state expanded outside Madina, the rights of the different communities, as they were constituted in the [[Constitution of Medina]] still applied. The Quran also gave additional rights to the citizens of the state and these rights were also applied. Ali, Hassan and [[Hussein ibn Ali]] gave their allegiance to the first three caliphs because they abided by these conditions. Later [[Ali]] the fourth caliph wrote in a letter \"I did not approach the people to get their oath of allegiance but they came to me with their desire to make me their Amir (ruler). I did not extend my hands towards them so that they might swear the oath of allegiance to me but they themselves extended their hands towards me\".<ref>Nahj ul Balagha Letter 54</ref> But later as fate would have it ([[Predestination in Islam]]) when [[Yazid I]], an oppressive ruler took power, Hussein ibn Ali the grandson of [[Muhammad]] felt that it was a test from God for him and his duty to confront him. Then [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]], [[Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]]'s cousin confronted the [[Umayyad]] rulers after Hussein ibn Ali was betrayed by the people of Kufa and killed by Syrian Roman Army now under the control of the [[Yazid I]] the Umayyad ruler.<ref>Najeebabadi, Akbar Shah (2001). The History of Islam V.2. Riyadh: Darussalam. p. 110. {{ISBN|9960-892-88-3}}.</ref> Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr then took on the Umayyads and expelled their forces from Hijaz and Iraq. But then his forces were depleted in Iraq, trying to stop the Khawarij. The Ummayads then moved in. After a lengthy campaign, in his last hour Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr asked his mother [[Asma' bint Abu Bakr]] the daughter of [[Abu Bakr]] the first caliph for advice. Asma' bint Abu Bakr replied to her son, she said:<ref name=\"ummah.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ummah.com/forum/showthread.php?347728-The-Advice-of-Asmaa-bint-Abu-Bakr-(ra)-to-her-son-Abdullah-Ibn-Zubair-(ra)|title=The Advice of Asmaa bint Abu Bakr (ra) to her son Abdullah Ibn Zubair (ra)|publisher=}}</ref> \"You know better in your own self, that if you are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth, for people more honourable than you have been killed and if you are not upon the truth, then what an evil son you are and you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you. If you say, that if you are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others, then you will not truly be free\". Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr left and was later also killed and crucified by the Syrian Roman Army now under the control of the Umayyads and led by Hajjaj. [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]] the son of [[Abu Bakr]] the first caliph and raised by [[Ali]] the fourth caliph was also killed by the [[Ummayad]]s.<ref>Nahj al-Balagha Sermon 71, Letter 27, Letter 34, Letter 35</ref> [[Aisha]] then raised and taught his son Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr who later taught his grandson [[Jafar al-Sadiq]].\n\nDuring the early Ummayad period, there was more community involvement. The Quran and Muhammad's example was the main source of law after which the community decided. If it worked for the community, was just and did not conflict with the Quran and the example of Muhammad, it was accepted. This made it easier for the different communities, with Roman, Persian, Central Asia and North African backgrounds to integrate into the Islamic State and that assisted in the quick expansion of the Islamic State. The scholars in Madina were consulted on the more complex judicial issues. The Sharia and the official more centralized schools of fiqh developed later, during the time of the Abbasids.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Muawiya Restorer of the Muslim Faith By Aisha Bewley p. 68</ref>\n\n==Components==\n{{see|Principles of Islamic jurisprudence}}\n[[File:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|thumb|350px|Legal systems of the world]]\nThe sources of ''fiqh'' in order of importance are\n#the [[Qur'an]]\n#[[Hadith]]\n#[[Ijma]], i.e. collective reasoning and consensus amongst authoritative Muslims of a particular generation, and its interpretation by Islamic scholars.\n#[[Qiyas]], i.e. analogy which is deployed if ''Ijma'' or historic collective reasoning on the issue is not available.<ref name=\"overview\">{{cite book|editor1-first=Hisham M. |editor1-last=Ramadan|author1=Irshad Abdel Haqq|authorlink1=Islamic law: An Overview of Its Origins and Elements|title=Understanding Islamic Law: From Classical to Contemporary|publisher=Rowman Altamira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZS7EaHTQX8C&pg=PA1&dq=Islamic+law:+An+Overview+of+Its+Origins+and+Elements&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwioosO24cnOAhXGNSYKHQImBCgQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=Islamic%20law%3A%20An%20Overview%20of%20Its%20Origins%20and%20Elements&f=false |accessdate=17 August 2016}}</ref>\nThe [[Qur'an]] gives clear instructions on many issues, such as how to perform the ritual purification (''{{lang|ar|[[wudu]]}}'') before the obligatory daily prayers (''{{lang|ar|[[salat]]}}''), but on other issues, some Muslims believe the Qur'an alone is not enough to make things clear. For example, the Qur'an states one needs to engage in daily prayers (''{{lang|ar|[[salat]]}}'') and fast (''{{lang|ar|[[sawm]]}}'') during the [[Ramadan (calendar month)|month of Ramadan]] but Muslims believe they need further instructions on how to perform these duties. Details about these issues can be found in the traditions of Muhammad, so [[Qur'an and Sunnah]] are in most cases the basis for (''{{lang|ar|[[Shariah]]}}'').\n\nSome topics are without precedent in Islam's early period. In those cases, Muslim jurists (''{{lang|ar|[[Fuqaha]]}}'') try to arrive at conclusions by other means. [[Sunni]] jurists use historical consensus of the community (''{{lang|ar|[[Ijma]]}}''); a majority in the modern era also use [[analogy]] (''{{lang|ar|[[Qiyas]]}}'') and weigh the harms and benefits of new topics (''{{lang|ar|[[Istislah]]}}''), and a plurality utilizes juristic preference (''{{lang|ar|[[Istihsan]]}}''). The conclusions arrived at with the aid of these additional tools constitute a wider array of laws than the Sharia consists of, and is called '''fiqh'''. Thus, in contrast to the ''sharia'', ''fiqh'' is not regarded as [[sacred]] and the schools of thought have differing views on its details, without viewing other conclusions as [[Sacrilege|sacrilegious]]. This division of interpretation in more detailed issues has resulted in different schools of thought (''{{lang|ar|[[madh'hab]]}}'').\n\nThis wider concept of '''Islamic jurisprudence''' is the source of a range of laws in different topics that guide Muslims in everyday life.\n\n=== Component categories ===\n\nIslamic jurisprudence (''fiqh'') covers two main areas:\n# Rules in relation to actions, and,\n# Rules in relation to circumstances surrounding actions.\n\nThese types of rules can also fall into two groups:\n# Worship ([[Ibadah|Ibadaat]])\n# Dealings and transactions (with people) ([[Muamalat|Mu`amalaat]])\n\nRules in relation to actions ('''amaliyya'' \u2014 \u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0629) or \"[[Ahkam|decision types]]\" comprise:\n# Obligation (''[[fardh]]'')\n# Recommendation (''[[mustahabb]]'')\n# Permissibility (''[[mubah]]'')\n# Disrecommendation (''[[makrooh]]'')\n# Prohibition (''[[haraam]]'')\n\nRules in relation to circumstances (''wadia''') comprise:\n# Condition (''shart'')\n# Cause (''sabab'')\n# Preventor (''mani'')\n# Permit / Enforced (''rukhsah, azeemah'')\n# Valid / Corrupt / Invalid (''sahih, fasid, batil'')\n# In time / Deferred / Repeat (''adaa, qadaa, i'ada'')\n\n=== Methodologies of jurisprudence ===\n{{main article|Usul al-fiqh}}\n\nThe [[modus operandi]] of the Muslim jurist is known as ''[[usul al-fiqh]]'' (\"principles of jurisprudence\").\n\nThere are different approaches to the methodology used in jurisprudence to derive Islamic law from the primary sources. The main methodologies are those of the [[Sunni]], [[Shi'a]] and [[Ibadi]] denominations. While both Sunni and [[Shi'ite]] (Shia) are divided into smaller sub-schools, the differences among the Shi'ite schools is considerably greater. Ibadites only follow a single school without divisions.\n\n;Fatawa\nWhile using court decisions as legal precedents and [[case law]] are central to Western law, the importance of the institution of fatawa (non-binding answers by Islamic legal scholars to legal questions) has been called \"central to the development\" of Islamic jurisprudence.<ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:32>[[#MAEGIFLEP2006|El-Gamal, ''Islamic Finance'', 2006]]: p. 32</ref>  This is in part because of a \"vacuum\" in the other source of Islamic law, ''qada`'' (legal rulings by state appointed Islamic judges) after the fall of the last [[caliphate]] the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/> While the practice in Islam dates back to the time of Muhammad, according to at least one source (Muhammad El-Gamal), it is \"modeled after the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] system of ''[[responsa]]'',\" and gives the questioner \"decisive primary-mover advantage in choosing he question and its wording.\"<ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/>\n\n;Arguments for and against reform\nEach school (''[[madhhab]]'') reflects a unique ''[[al-urf]]'' or culture (a cultural practice that was influenced by traditions), that the classical jurists themselves lived in, when rulings were made. Some suggest that the discipline of ''[[isnad]]'', which developed to validate ''hadith'' made it relatively easy to record and validate also the rulings of jurists. This, in turn, made them far easier to imitate (''[[taqlid]]'') than to challenge in new contexts. The argument is, the schools have been more or less frozen for centuries, and reflect a culture that simply no longer exists. Traditional scholars hold that religion is there to regulate human behavior and nurture people's moral side and since human nature has not fundamentally changed since the beginning of Islam a call to modernize the religion is essentially one to relax all laws and institutions.\n\nEarly ''[[shariah]]'' had a much more flexible character, and some modern Muslim scholars believe that it should be renewed, and that the classical jurists should lose special status.  This would require formulating a new fiqh suitable for the modern world, e.g. as proposed by advocates of the [[Islamization of knowledge]], which would deal with the modern context. This modernization is opposed by most conservative ''[[ulema]]''. Traditional scholars hold that the laws are contextual and consider circumstance such as time, place and culture, the principles they are based upon are universal such as justice, equality and respect. Many Muslim scholars argue that even though technology may have advanced, the fundamentals of human life have not.\n\n=== Fields of jurisprudence ===\n\n<div class=\"hlist\">\n<!--Alphabetical:-->\n*[[Islamic criminal jurisprudence|Criminal]]\n*[[Islamic economical jurisprudence|Economics]]\n*[[Adab (behavior)|Etiquette]]\n*[[Hygiene in Islam|Hygienical]]\n*[[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence|Inheritance]]\n*[[Islamic marital jurisprudence|Marital]]\n*[[Rules of war in Islam|Military]]\n*[[Islamic political jurisprudence|Political]]\n*[[Islamic theological jurisprudence|Theological]]\n</div>\n\n=== Schools of jurisprudence ===\n{{Main article|Madhhab}}\nThere are several [[Madhhab|schools of fiqh thought]] ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0630\u0647\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ma\u1e0fhab}}''; pl. {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0630\u0627\u0647\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ma\u1e0f\u0101hib}}'')\n[[File:Madhhab Map3.png|thumb|650px|Map of the Muslim world with the main [[madh'hab]]s.]]\nThe schools of [[Sunnite|Sunni]] Islam are each named by students of the classical jurist who taught them.

But when some of the more shocking passages from his writings were read, they were almost universally seen as blasphemous.\"<ref name=\"Carroll 1987 11\" /> Bishops [[Theognis of Nicaea]] and [[Maris of Chalcedon]] were among the initial supporters of Arius.\n\nEusebius of Caesarea called to mind the baptismal creed of his own [[diocese]] at [[Caesarea Palaestina|Caesarea]] at Palestine, as a form of reconciliation. The majority of the bishops agreed. For some time, scholars thought that the original Nicene Creed was based on this statement of Eusebius. Today, most scholars think that the Creed is derived from the baptismal [[creed of Jerusalem]], as [[Hans Lietzmann]] proposed.\n\nThe orthodox bishops won approval of every one of their proposals regarding the Creed. After being in session for an entire month, the council promulgated on 19 June the [[Nicene Creed#The original Nicene Creed of 325|original Nicene Creed]]. This profession of faith was adopted by all the bishops \"but two from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] who had been closely associated with Arius from the beginning\".<ref name=\"Carroll 1987 12\" /> No explicit historical record of their dissent actually exists; the signatures of these bishops are simply absent from the Creed. The sessions continued to deal with minor matters until 25 August.<ref name=\"The First Council of Nicaea\"/>\n\n== Arian controversy ==\n{{Main|Arius|Arianism|Arian controversy}}\n[[File:Constantine burning Arian books.jpg|thumb|upright|The synod of Nicaea, Constantine and the condemnation and burning of Arian books, illustration from a northern Italian compendium of canon law, ca. 825]]\n\nThe Arian controversy arose in [[Alexandria]] when the newly reinstated presbyter [[Arius]]<ref>{{harvnb|Anatolios|2011|p=44}}</ref> began to spread doctrinal views that were contrary to those of his bishop, St. [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]]. The disputed issues centered on the natures and relationship of God (the Father) and the Son of God (Jesus). The disagreements sprang from different ideas about the [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]] and what it meant for Jesus to be God's Son. Alexander maintained that the Son was divine in just the same sense that the Father is, coeternal with the Father, else he could not be a true Son.<ref name=\"kelly1978\" /><ref name=\"Davis 1983 52\u201354\" />\n\nArius emphasized the supremacy and uniqueness of God the Father, meaning that the Father alone is almighty and infinite, and that therefore the Father's divinity must be greater than the Son's. Arius taught that the Son had a beginning, and that he possessed neither the eternity nor the true divinity of the Father, but was rather made \"God\" only by the Father's permission and power, and that the Son was rather the very first and the most perfect of God's creatures.<ref name=\"kelly1978\" /><ref name=\"Davis 1983 52\u201354\">{{harvnb|Davis|1983|pp=52\u201354}}</ref>\n\nThe Arian discussions and debates at the council extended from about 20 May 325, through about 19 June.<ref name=\"Davis 1983 52\u201354\" /> According to legendary accounts, debate became so heated that at one point, Arius was struck in the face by [[Nicholas of Myra]], who would later be canonized.<ref>{{harvnb|OCA|2014}}</ref> This account is almost certainly apocryphal, as Arius himself would not have been present in the council chamber due to the fact that he was not a bishop.<ref>{{harvnb|Gonz\u00e1lez|1984|p=164}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the debate hinged on the difference between being \"born\" or \"created\" and being \"begotten\". Arians saw these as essentially the same; followers of Alexander did not. The exact meaning of many of the words used in the debates at Nicaea were still unclear to speakers of other languages. [[Koine Greek|Greek]] words like \"essence\" (''[[ousia]]''), \"substance\" (''[[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostasis]]''), \"nature\" (''physis''), \"person\" (''prosopon'') bore a variety of meanings drawn from pre-Christian philosophers, which could not but entail misunderstandings until they were cleared up. The word ''[[Homoousian|homoousia]]'', in particular, was initially disliked by many bishops because of its associations with [[Gnostic]] heretics (who used it in their theology), and because their heresies had been condemned at the 264\u2013268 [[Synods of Antioch]].\n\n=== Arguments for Arianism ===\nAccording to surviving accounts, the [[presbyter]] [[Arius]] argued for [[Subordinationism|the supremacy of God the Father]], and maintained that the Son of God was created as an act of the Father's will, and therefore that the Son was a creature made by God, begotten directly of the infinite, eternal God. Arius's argument was that the Son was God's very first production, before all ages, the position being that the Son had a beginning, and that only the Father has no beginning. And Arius argued that everything else was created through the Son. Thus, said the Arians, only the Son was directly created and begotten of God; and therefore there was a time that He had no existence. Arius believed that the Son of God was capable of His own free will of right and wrong, and that \"were He in the truest sense a son, He must have come after the Father, therefore the time obviously was when He was not, and hence He was a finite being\",<ref>{{harvnb|M'Clintock|Strong|1890|p=45}}</ref> and that He was under God the Father. Therefore, Arius insisted that the Father's divinity was greater than the Son's. The Arians appealed to Scripture, quoting biblical statements such as \"the Father is greater than I\",<ref>{{bibleref2|John|14:28}}</ref> and also that the Son is \"firstborn of all creation\".<ref>{{bibleref2|Colossians|1:15}}</ref>\n\n=== Arguments against Arianism ===\n[[File:Nikea-arius.png|thumb|upright|The Council of Nicaea, with Arius depicted as defeated by the council, lying under the feet of [[Emperor Constantine]]]]\nThe opposing view stemmed from the idea that begetting the Son is itself in the nature of the Father, which is eternal. Thus, the Father was always a Father, and both Father and Son existed always together, eternally, coequally and consubstantially.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1983|p=60}}</ref> The contra-Arian argument thus stated that the Logos was \"eternally begotten\", therefore with no beginning. Those in opposition to Arius believed that to follow the Arian view destroyed the unity of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]], and made the Son unequal to the Father. They insisted that such a view was in contravention of such Scriptures as \"I and the Father are one\"<ref name=\"bibleref2|John|10:30\">{{bibleref2|John|10:30}}</ref> and \"the Word was God\",<ref name=\"bibleref2|John|10:30\" /> as such verses were interpreted. They declared, as did Athanasius,<ref>On the Incarnation, ch 2, section 9, \"... yet He Himself, as the Word, being immortal and the Father's Son\"</ref> that the Son had no beginning, but had an \"eternal derivation\" from the Father, and therefore was coeternal with him, and equal to God in all aspects.<ref>Athanasius (Patriarch of Alexandria) \u2013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7ZaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=select+treatises+athanasius+birth+without+a+becoming&source=bl&ots=mpj7gECxj9&sig=np6MSGwgZ_1iYNXUFnFcbRujqZA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lgaAU7iQGNWrsATn74Aw&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=select%20treatises%20athanasius%20birth%20without%20a%20becoming&f=false Select treatises of St. Athanasius in controversy with the Arians, Volume 3] Translator and Editor John Henry Newman.

Retrieved 24 May 2014.</ref>\n\n=== Result of the debate ===\n\nThe Council declared that the [[God the Son|Son]] was true God, coeternal with the Father and begotten from His same substance, arguing that such a doctrine best codified the Scriptural presentation of the Son as well as traditional Christian belief about him handed down from the [[Apostles]]. This belief was expressed by the bishops in the [[Creed of Nicaea]], which would form the basis of what has since been known as the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gonz\u00e1lez|1984|p=165}}</ref>\n\n== Nicene Creed ==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2018}}\n{{Main|Nicene Creed}}\n[[File:Nicaea icon.jpg|thumb|upright|Icon depicting [[Constantine I|the Emperor Constantine]] and the bishops of the First Council of Nicaea (325) holding the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed|Niceno\u2013Constantinopolitan Creed of 381]]]]\n\nOne of the projects undertaken by the Council was the creation of a Creed, a declaration and summary of the Christian faith. Several creeds were already in existence; many creeds were acceptable to the members of the council, including Arius. From earliest times, various creeds served as a means of identification for Christians, as a means of inclusion and recognition, especially at baptism.\n\nIn Rome, for example, the [[Apostles' Creed]] was popular, especially for use in [[Lent]] and the Easter season. In the Council of Nicaea, one specific creed was used to define the Church's faith clearly, to include those who professed it, and to exclude those who did not.\n\nSome distinctive elements in the [[Comparison of Nicene Creeds of 325 and 381|Nicene Creed]], perhaps from the hand of Hosius of Cordova, were added, some specifically to counter the Arian point of view.<ref name=\"kelly1978\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Loyn|1991|p=240}}</ref>\n\n# Jesus Christ is described as \"Light from Light, true God from true God,\" proclaiming his divinity.\n# Jesus Christ is said to be \"begotten, not made,\" asserting that he was not a mere creature, brought into being out of nothing, but the true Son of God, brought into being \"from the substance of the Father.\"\n# He is said to be \"of one being with the Father,\" proclaiming that although Jesus Christ is \"true God\" and God the Father is also \"true God,\" they are \"of one being,\" in accord to what is found in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#10:30|John 10:30]]: \"I and the Father are one.\" The Greek term ''homoousios'', or ''[[consubstantial]]'' (i.e., \"of the '''same''' substance) is ascribed by [[Eusebius]] to Constantine who, on this particular point, may have chosen to exercise his authority. The significance of this clause, however, is extremely ambiguous as to the extent in which Jesus Christ and God the Father are \"of one being,\" and the issues it raised would be seriously controverted in the future.\n\nAt the end of the creed came a list of [[Anathema#Early Church|anathemas]], designed to repudiate explicitly the Arians' stated claims.\n\n# The view that \"there was once when he was not\" was rejected to maintain the coeternity of the Son with the Father.\n# The view that he was \"mutable or subject to change\" was rejected to maintain that the Son just like the Father was beyond any form of weakness or corruptibility, and most importantly that he could not fall away from absolute moral perfection.\n\nThus, instead of a baptismal creed acceptable to both the Arians and their opponents the council promulgated one which was clearly opposed to Arianism and incompatible with the distinctive core of their beliefs. The text of this profession of faith is preserved in a letter of Eusebius to his congregation, in Athanasius, and elsewhere. Although the most vocal of anti-Arians, the [[Homoousian]]s (from the [[Koine Greek]] word translated as \"of same substance\" which was condemned at the [[Synods of Antioch|Council of Antioch]] in 264\u2013268) were in the minority, the Creed was accepted by the council as an expression of the bishops' common faith and the ancient faith of the whole Church.{{cn|date=May 2018}}\n\nBishop Hosius of Cordova, one of the firm Homoousians, may well have helped bring the council to consensus. At the time of the council, he was the confidant of the emperor in all Church matters. Hosius stands at the head of the lists of bishops, and Athanasius ascribes to him the actual formulation of the creed. Great leaders such as [[Eustathius of Antioch]], [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]], [[Athanasius]], and [[Marcellus of Ancyra]] all adhered to the Homoousian position.\n\nIn spite of his sympathy for Arius, Eusebius of Caesarea adhered to the decisions of the council, accepting the entire creed. The initial number of bishops supporting Arius was small. After a month of discussion, on 19 June, there were only two left: Theonas of Marmarica in Libya, and Secundus of Ptolemais. Maris of Chalcedon, who initially supported Arianism, agreed to the whole creed. Similarly, [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]] and Theognis of Nice also agreed, except for certain statements.\n\nThe Emperor carried out his earlier statement: everybody who refused to endorse the Creed would be [[exile]]d. Arius, Theonas, and Secundus refused to adhere to the creed, and were thus exiled to [[Illyria]], in addition to being [[excommunication|excommunicated]]. The works of Arius were ordered to be confiscated and [[book burning|consigned to the flames]],<ref name=EB1911/> while his supporters considered as \"enemies of Christianity.\" {{sfn|Schaff|Schaff|1910|loc=Section 120}} Nevertheless, the controversy continued in various parts of the empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Lutz von Padberg|1998|p=26}}</ref>\n\nThe Creed was amended to a new version by the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381.\n\n== Separation of Easter computation from Jewish calendar ==\nThe feast of Easter is linked to the Jewish [[Passover]] and Feast of Unleavened Bread, as Christians believe that the [[crucifixion]] and [[resurrection]] of Jesus occurred at the time of those observances.\n\nAs early as [[Pope Sixtus I]], some Christians had set Easter to a Sunday in the lunar month of [[Nisan]]. To determine which lunar month was to be designated as Nisan, Christians relied on the Jewish community. By the later 3rd century some Christians began to express dissatisfaction with what they took to be the disorderly state of the [[Jewish calendar]]. They argued that contemporary Jews were identifying the wrong lunar month as the month of Nisan, choosing a month whose 14th day fell before the spring equinox.{{Sfn |Anatolius|loc=Book 7, Chapter 33}}\n\nChristians, these thinkers argued, should abandon the custom of relying on Jewish informants and instead do their own computations to determine which month should be styled Nisan, setting Easter within this independently computed, Christian Nisan, which would always locate the festival after the equinox. They justified this break with tradition by arguing that it was in fact the contemporary Jewish calendar that had broken with tradition by ignoring the equinox, and that in former times the 14th of Nisan had never preceded the equinox.{{Sfn |Chronicon Paschale}}  Others felt that the customary practice of reliance on the Jewish calendar should continue, even if the Jewish computations were in error from a Christian point of view.{{Sfn |Panarion |loc=Book 3, Chapter 1, Section 10}}\n\nThe controversy between those who argued for independent computations and those who argued for continued reliance on the Jewish calendar was formally resolved by the Council, which endorsed the independent procedure that had been in use for some time at Rome and Alexandria. Easter was henceforward to be a Sunday in a lunar month chosen according to Christian criteria\u2014in effect, a Christian Nisan\u2014not in the month of Nisan as defined by Jews.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> Those who argued for continued reliance on the Jewish calendar (called \"protopaschites\" by later historians) were urged to come around to the majority position. That they did not all immediately do so is revealed by the existence of sermons,{{Sfn |Chrysostom |p= 47}} canons,{{Sfn |SEC|p=594}} and tracts{{Sfn |Panarion |loc=Book 3, Chapter 1}} written against the protopaschite practice in the later 4th century.\n\nThese two rules, independence of the Jewish calendar and worldwide uniformity, were the only rules for Easter explicitly laid down by the Council. No details for the computation were specified; these were worked out in practice, a process that took centuries and generated a number of [[Easter controversy|controversies]] (see also [[Computus]] and [[Reform of the date of Easter]].) In particular, the Council did not seem to decree that Easter must fall on Sunday.{{Sfn |Sozomen|loc=Book 7, Chapter 18}}\n\nNor did the Council decree that Easter must never coincide with Nisan 14 (the first Day of Unleavened Bread, now commonly called \"Passover\") in the [[Hebrew calendar]]. By endorsing the move to independent computations, the Council had separated the Easter computation from all dependence, positive or negative, on the Jewish calendar. The \"Zonaras proviso\", the claim that Easter must always follow Nisan 14 in the Hebrew calendar, was not formulated until after some centuries. By that time, the accumulation of errors in the Julian solar and lunar calendars had made it the de facto state of affairs that Julian Easter always followed Hebrew Nisan 14.{{Sfn |L'Huillier|1996 |p= 25}}\n\n== Meletian schism ==\n{{Main|Meletius of Lycopolis}}\nThe suppression of the Meletian schism, an early breakaway sect, was another important matter that came before the Council of Nicaea. Meletius, it was decided, should remain in his own city of [[Lycopolis]] in Egypt, but without exercising authority or the power to ordain new clergy; he was forbidden to go into the environs of the town or to enter another [[diocese]] for the purpose of ordaining its subjects. Meletius retained his episcopal title, but the ecclesiastics ordained by him were to receive again the [[Christian laying on of hands|laying on of hands]], the ordinations performed by Meletius being therefore regarded as invalid. Clergy ordained by Meletius were ordered to yield precedence to those ordained by Alexander, and they were not to do anything without the consent of Bishop Alexander.<ref>{{harvnb|Leclercq|1911a}}</ref>\n\nIn the event of the death of a non-Meletian bishop or ecclesiastic, the vacant [[Episcopal see|see]] might be given to a Meletian, provided he was worthy and the popular election were ratified by Alexander. As to Meletius himself, episcopal rights and prerogatives were taken from him. These mild measures, however, were in vain; the Meletians joined the Arians and caused more dissension than ever, being among the worst enemies of [[Athanasius]]. The Meletians ultimately died out around the middle of the fifth century.\n\n== Promulgation of canon law ==\n{{canon law}}\n{{Main|Canon law|Collections of ancient canons|Promulgation (canon law)}}\nThe council promulgated twenty new church laws, called ''[[canon law|canons]]'', (though the exact number is subject to debate), that is, unchanging rules of discipline. The twenty as listed in the [[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers]]<ref>{{harvnb|Canons}}</ref> are as follows:\n\n: 1. prohibition of self-[[castration]]\n: 2. establishment of a minimum term for [[catechumen]]s (persons studying for baptism)\n: 3. prohibition of the presence in the house of a cleric of a younger woman who might bring him under suspicion (the so called ''[[virgines subintroductae]]'', who practiced [[Syneisaktism]])\n: 4. ordination of a bishop in the presence of at least three provincial bishops<ref name=EB1911/> and confirmation by the [[metropolitan bishop]]\n: 5. provision for two provincial [[synod]]s to be held annually\n: 6. confirmation of ancient customs giving jurisdiction over large regions to the bishops of Alexandria, Rome, and Antioch\n: 7. recognition of the honorary rights of the see of [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]\n: 8. provision for agreement with the [[Novatianism|Novatianists]], an early sect\n: 9\u201314. provision for mild procedure against the [[Lapsi (Christianity)|lapsed]] during the persecution under [[Licinius]]\n: 15\u201316. prohibition of the removal of [[priests]]\n: 17. prohibition of [[usury]] among the clergy\n: 18. precedence of bishops and [[presbyters]] before [[deacons]] in receiving the [[Eucharist]] (Holy Communion)\n: 19. declaration of the invalidity of [[baptism]] by [[Paul of Samosata|Paulian heretics]]\n: 20. prohibition of kneeling on Sundays and during the [[Pentecost]] (the fifty days commencing on Easter). Standing was the normative posture for prayer at this time, as it still is among the Eastern Christians. Kneeling was considered most appropriate to penitential prayer, as distinct from the festive nature of Eastertide and its remembrance every Sunday. The canon itself was designed only to ensure uniformity of practise at the designated times.\n\nOn 25 July 325, in conclusion, the fathers of the council celebrated the Emperor's twentieth anniversary. In his farewell address, Constantine informed the audience how averse he was to dogmatic controversy; he wanted the Church to live in harmony and peace. In a circular letter, he announced the accomplished unity of practice by the whole Church in the date of the celebration of Christian Passover (Easter).\n\n== Effects of the council ==\n\nThe long-term effects of the Council of Nicaea were significant. For the first time, representatives of many of the bishops of the Church convened to agree on a doctrinal statement. Also for the first time, the Emperor played a role, by calling together the bishops under his authority, and using the power of the state to give the council's orders effect.\n\nIn the short-term, however, the council did not completely solve the problems it was convened to discuss and a period of conflict and upheaval continued for some time. Constantine himself was succeeded by two Arian Emperors in the Eastern Empire: his son, [[Constantius II]] and [[Valens]]. Valens could not resolve the outstanding ecclesiastical issues, and unsuccessfully confronted [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil]] over the Nicene Creed.<ref>{{harvnb|AOC|1968}}</ref>\n\nPagan powers within the Empire sought to maintain and at times re-establish paganism into the seat of the Emperor (see [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]] and [[Julian the Apostate]]). Arians and Meletians soon regained nearly all of the rights they had lost, and consequently, Arianism continued to spread and be a subject of debate within the Church during the remainder of the fourth century. Almost immediately, [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]], an Arian bishop and cousin to Constantine I, used his influence at court to sway Constantine's favor from the proto-orthodox Nicene bishops to the Arians.<ref name=\"Davis 1983 77\">{{harvnb|Davis|1983|p=77}}</ref>\n\n[[Eustathius of Antioch]] was deposed and exiled in 330. Athanasius, who had succeeded [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander]] as Bishop of Alexandria, was deposed by the [[First Synod of Tyre]] in 335 and [[Marcellus of Ancyra]] followed him in 336. Arius himself returned to Constantinople to be readmitted into the Church, but died shortly before he could be received. Constantine died the next year, after finally receiving baptism from Arian Bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia, and \"with his passing the first round in the battle after the Council of Nicaea was ended\".<ref name=\"Davis 1983 77\" />\n\n== Role of Constantine ==\n{{See also|Constantine the Great and Christianity}}\nChristianity was illegal in the empire until the emperors Constantine and [[Licinius]] agreed in 313 to what became known as the [[Edict of Milan]]. However, Nicene Christianity did not become the [[state religion]] of the [[Roman Empire]] until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380. In the mean time, paganism remained legal and present in public affairs. Constantine's coinage and other official motifs, until the Council of Nicaea, had affiliated him with the pagan cult of [[Sol Invictus]]. At first, Constantine encouraged the construction of new temples<ref>Gerberding, R. and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 28.</ref> and tolerated [[Religion in ancient Rome#Sacrifice|traditional sacrifices]].<ref>Peter Brown, ''The Rise of Christendom'' 2nd edition (Oxford, Blackwell Publishing, 2003) p. 60.</ref> Later in his reign, he gave orders for the [[pillaging]] and the tearing down of [[Roman temple]]s.<ref>R.

As Emperor, the responsibility for maintaining civil order was his, and he sought that the Church be of one mind and at peace. When first informed of the unrest in Alexandria due to the Arian disputes, he was \"greatly troubled\" and, \"rebuked\" both Arius and Bishop [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander]] for originating the disturbance and allowing it to become public.<ref name=\"sozomen1\">{{harvnb|Sozomen|loc=Book 1, Chapter 16}}</ref> Aware also of \"the diversity of opinion\" regarding the celebration of Easter and hoping to settle both issues, he sent the \"honored\" Bishop [[Hosius of Corduba|Hosius of Cordova]] (Hispania) to form a local church council and \"reconcile those who were divided\".<ref name=\"sozomen1\" /> When that embassy failed, he turned to summoning a synod at Nicaea, inviting \"the most eminent men of the churches in every country\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sozomen|loc=Book 1, Chapter 17}}</ref>\n\nConstantine assisted in assembling the council by arranging that travel expenses to and from the bishops' [[episcopal see]]s, as well as lodging at Nicaea, be covered out of public funds.<ref name=\"theodoret1\">{{harvnb|Theodoret|loc=Book 1, Chapter 6}}</ref> He also provided and furnished a \"great hall ... in the palace\" as a place for discussion so that the attendees \"should be treated with becoming dignity\".<ref name=\"theodoret1\" /> In addressing the opening of the council, he \"exhorted the Bishops to unanimity and concord\" and called on them to follow the Holy Scriptures with: \"Let, then, all contentious disputation be discarded; and let us seek in the divinely-inspired word the solution of the questions at issue.\"<ref name=\"theodoret1\" />\n\nThereupon, the debate about Arius and church doctrine began.  \"The emperor gave patient attention to the speeches of both parties\" and \"deferred\" to the decision of the bishops.<ref>{{harvnb|Sozomen|loc=Book 1, Chapter 20}}</ref> The bishops first pronounced Arius' teachings to be anathema, formulating the creed as a statement of correct doctrine. When Arius and two followers refused to agree, the bishops pronounced clerical judgement by excommunicating them from the Church. Respecting the clerical decision, and seeing the threat of continued unrest, Constantine also pronounced civil judgement, banishing them into exile. This was the beginning of the practice of using secular power to establish doctrinal orthodoxy within Christianity, an example followed by all later Christian emperors, which led to a circle of Christian violence, and of Christian resistance couched in terms of martyrdom.<ref>There is no crime for those who have Christ; religious violence in the Roman Empire.

Some scholars believe that this request provided motivation for [[Development of the Christian Biblical canon|canon lists]]. In [[Jerome]]'s ''Prologue to Judith'',<ref>{{harvnb|Preface to Tobit and Judith}}</ref> he claims that the [[Book of Judith]] was \"found by the Nicene Council to have been counted among the number of the Sacred Scriptures\", which some have suggested means the Nicene Council did discuss what documents would number among the sacred scriptures, but more likely simply means the Council used Judith in its deliberations on other matters and so it should be considered canonical.{{cn|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe main source of the idea that the Bible was created at the Council of Nicaea seems to be [[Voltaire]], who popularised a story that the canon was determined by placing all the competing books on an altar during the Council and then keeping the ones that did not fall off. The original source of this \"fictitious anecdote\" is the ''[[Synodicon Vetus]]'',<ref>{{cite book |title=Ecce homo!: An Eighteenth Century Life of Jesus |others=Critical Edition and Revision of George Houston's Translation from the French |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrDnBQAAQBAJ |author=Paul T. d' Holbach |author-link=Baron d'Holbach |editor=Andrew Hunwick |year=1995 |location=Berlin, New York |publisher=Walter de Gruyter & Co. |isbn=978-3-11-081141-4 |pages=48\u201349}}</ref> a pseudo-historical account of early Church councils from AD 887:<ref>A concise summary of the case can be found at [http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?223888-The-Council-of-Nicea-the-beginnings-of-the-Biblical-Canon-and-some-historical-myths-and-nonsense&p=4408782#post4408782], or less readable in http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/nicaea.html .</ref><blockquote>The canonical and apocryphal books it distinguished in the following manner: in the house of God the books were placed down by the holy altar; then the council asked the Lord in prayer that the inspired works be found on top and\u2014as in fact happened\u2014the spurious on the bottom.<ref>''Synodicon Vetus'', 35</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Trinity ===\nThe council of Nicaea dealt primarily with the issue of the deity of Christ. Over a century earlier the term \"Trinity\" (''{{lang|grc|\u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2}}'' in Greek; ''trinitas'' in Latin) was used in the writings of [[Origen]] (185\u2013254) and [[Tertullian]] (160\u2013220), and a general notion of a \"divine three\", in some sense, was expressed in the second-century writings of [[Polycarp]], [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], and [[Justin Martyr]]. In Nicaea, questions regarding the Holy Spirit were left largely unaddressed until after the relationship between the Father and the Son was settled around the year 362.<ref>{{harvnb|Fairbairn|2009|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> So the doctrine in a more full-fledged form was not formulated until the [[Council of Constantinople (360)|Council of Constantinople]] in 360 AD,<ref>{{harvnb|Socrates|loc=Book 2, Chapter 41}}</ref> and a final form formulated in 381 AD, primarily crafted by Gregory of Nyssa.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AIAXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA477#v=onepage&q&f=false Gregory of Nyssa, The Great Catechism ch. 3 in Schaff, Ante-Nicene, supra, 477]</ref>\n\n=== Constantine ===\n{{Main|Constantine the Great}}\nWhile Constantine had sought a unified church after the council, he did not force the [[Homoousian]] view of Christ's nature on the council (see [[First Council of Nicaea#Role of Constantine|The role of Constantine]]).\n\nConstantine did not commission any Bibles at the council itself. He did [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine|commission fifty Bibles]] in 331 for use in the churches of Constantinople, itself still a new city. No historical evidence points to involvement on his part in selecting or omitting books for inclusion in commissioned Bibles.\n\nDespite Constantine's sympathetic interest in the Church, he was not baptized until some 11 or 12 years after the council, putting off baptism as long as he did so as to be absolved from as much sin as possible<ref>Marilena Amerise, 'Il battesimo di Costantino il Grande.\"</ref> in accordance with the belief that in baptism all sin is forgiven fully and completely.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a10.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |publisher=Vatican |accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Disputed matters ==\n\n=== Role of the Bishop of Rome ===\n{{See also|Primacy of the Roman pontiff|East-West Schism}}\n\nRoman Catholics assert that the idea of Christ's deity was ultimately confirmed by the Bishop of Rome, and that it was this confirmation that gave the council its influence and authority. In support of this, they cite the position of early fathers and their expression of the need for all churches to agree with Rome (see Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'' III:3:2).{{cn|date=May 2018}}\n\nHowever, Protestants, Eastern Orthodox, and [[Oriental Orthodox]] do not believe the Council viewed the Bishop of Rome as the jurisdictional head of Christendom, or someone having authority over other bishops attending the Council. In support of this, they cite Canon 6, where the Roman Bishop could be seen as simply one of several influential leaders, but not one who had jurisdiction over other bishops in other regions.<ref>{{harvnb|Canons|loc=Canon 6}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Protestant theologian [[Philip Schaff]], \"The Nicene fathers passed this canon not as introducing anything new, but merely as confirming an existing relation on the basis of church tradition; and that, with special reference to Alexandria, on account of the troubles existing there. Rome was named only for illustration; and Antioch and all the other eparchies or provinces were secured their admitted rights. The [[Episcopal see|bishoprics]] of [[Early centers of Christianity#Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Rome]], and [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] were placed substantially on equal footing.\" Thus, according to Schaff, the Bishop of Alexandria was to have jurisdiction over the provinces of Egypt, Libya and the Pentapolis, just as the Bishop of Rome had authority \"with reference to his own diocese.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Schaff|Schaff|1910|pp=275\u2013276}}</ref>\n\nBut according to Fr. James F. Loughlin, there is an alternate Roman Catholic interpretation. It involves five different arguments \"drawn respectively from the grammatical structure of the sentence, from the logical sequence of ideas, from Catholic analogy, from comparison with the process of formation of the Byzantine Patriarchate, and from the authority of the ancients\"<ref name=\"Loughlin 1880\">{{harvnb|Loughlin|1880}}</ref> in favor of an alternative understanding of the canon. According to this interpretation, the canon shows the role the Bishop of Rome had when he, by his authority, confirmed the jurisdiction of the other patriarchs\u2014an interpretation which is in line with the Roman Catholic understanding of the Pope. Thus, the Bishop of Alexandria presided over Egypt, Libya and the Pentapolis,<ref name=EB1911/> while the Bishop of Antioch \"enjoyed a similar authority throughout the great diocese of Oriens,\" and all by the authority of the Bishop of Rome. To Loughlin, that was the only possible reason to invoke the custom of a Roman Bishop in a matter related to the two metropolitan bishops in Alexandria and Antioch.<ref name=\"Loughlin 1880\" />\n\nHowever, Protestant and Roman Catholic interpretations have historically assumed that some or all of the bishops identified in the canon were presiding over their own dioceses at the time of the Council\u2014the Bishop of Rome over the Diocese of Italy, as Schaff suggested, the Bishop of Antioch over the Diocese of Oriens, as Loughlin suggested, and the Bishop of Alexandria over the Diocese of Egypt, as suggested by [[Karl Josef von Hefele]]. According to Hefele, the Council had assigned to Alexandria, \"the whole (civil) Diocese of Egypt.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=von Hefele|first1=Karl|title=Conciliengeschichte, v. 1|date=1855|publisher=Herder|location=Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany|page=373}}</ref> Yet those assumptions have since been proven false. At the time of the Council, the [[Diocese of Egypt]] did not yet exist, so the Council could not have assigned it to Alexandria. Antioch and Alexandria were both located within the civil Diocese of Oriens, Antioch being the chief metropolis, but neither administered the whole. Likewise, Rome and Milan were both located within the civil Diocese of Italy, Milan being the chief metropolis,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Athanasius of Alexandria|title=Historia Arianorum, Part IV, chapter 36|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/28154.htm|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Athanasius of Alexandria|title=Apologia de Fuga, chapter 4|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2814.htm|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref> yet neither administered the whole.\n\nThis geographic issue related to Canon 6 was highlighted by Protestant writer, Timothy F. Kauffman, as a correction to the anachronism created by the assumption that each bishop was already presiding over a whole diocese at the time of the council.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kauffman|first1=Timothy F.|title=Nic\u00e6a and the Roman Precedent|journal=The Trinity Review|date=May\u2013June 2016|issue=334, 335|url=http://trinityfoundation.org/PDF/The%20Trinity%20Review%20334%20Nica%20and%20the%20Roman%20Precedent%20Kauffman.pdf|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref> According to Kauffman, since Milan and Rome were both located within the Diocese of Italy, and Antioch and Alexandria were both located within the Diocese of Oriens, a relevant and \"structural congruency\" between Rome and Alexandria was readily apparent to the gathered bishops: both had been made to share a diocese of which neither was the chief metropolis. Rome's jurisdiction within Italy had been defined in terms of several of the city's adjacent provinces since Diocletian's reordering of the empire in 293, as the earliest Latin version of the canon indicates,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Cuthberthus Hamilton|title=Ecclesiae Occidentalis monumenta iuris antiquissima, vol. 1|date=1899|publisher=Oxonii, E Typographeo Clarendoniano|page=120}}</ref> and the rest of the Italian provinces were under the jurisdiction of Milan.{{cn|date=May 2018}}\n\nThat provincial arrangement of Roman and Milanese jurisdiction within Italy therefore was a relevant precedent, and provided an administrative solution to the problem facing the council\u2014namely, how to define Alexandrian and Antiochian jurisdiction within the Diocese of Oriens. In canon 6, the Council left most of the diocese under Antioch's jurisdiction, and assigned a few provinces of the diocese to Alexandria, \"since the like is customary for the Bishop of Rome also.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=First Council of Nic\u00e6a|title=Canon 6|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3801.htm|website=The First Council of Nic\u00e6a|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn that scenario, a relevant Roman precedent is invoked, answering Loughlin's argument as to why the custom of a bishop in Rome would have any bearing on a dispute regarding Alexandria in Oriens, and at the same time correcting Schaff's argument that the bishop of Rome was invoked by way of illustration \"with reference to his own diocese.\" The custom of the bishop of Rome was invoked by way of illustration, not because he presided over the whole Church, or over the western Church or even over \"his own diocese,\" but rather because he presided over a few provinces in a diocese that was otherwise administered from Milan. On the basis of that precedent, the council recognized Alexandria's ancient jurisdiction over a few provinces in the Diocese of Oriens, a diocese that was otherwise administered from Antioch.{{cn|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Liturgical commemoration ==\nThe Churches of Byzantium celebrate the Fathers of the First Ecumenical Council on the seventh Sunday of Pascha (the Sunday before Pentecost).<ref>https://www.goarch.org/-/sunday-of-the-fathers-of-the-first-ecumenical-council</ref>  The [[Calendar of saints (Lutheran)|Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod]] celebrates the First Ecumenical Council on 12 June.

Over time, new technologies are discovered, which allow the construction of new city buildings and the deployment of new units. Players can wage war on one another or form diplomatic relationships.\n\nThe game ends when one civilization has eradicated all others or accomplished the goal of [[space colonization]], or at a given deadline. If more than one civilization remains at the deadline, the player with the highest score wins. Points are awarded for the size of a civilization, its wealth, and cultural and scientific advances.\n\n== History ==\nAt the [[computer science]] department at [[Aarhus University]], three students, avid players of [[XPilot]] and of Sid Meier's ''Civilization'', which was a stand-alone PC game for [[MS-DOS]], decided to find out whether the two could be fused into an [[X Window System|X]]-based multiplayer Civilization-like strategy game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/In_The_Beginning |title=Freeciv:In the Beginning |publisher=Freeciv.wikia.com |date=19 January 2007 |accessdate=14 April 2009}}</ref> The students\u2014Peter Unold, Claus Leth Gregersen and Allan Ove Kjeldbjerg\u2014started development in November 1995;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://play.freeciv.org/blog/2015/11/freeciv-founded-20-years-ago-today/|title=Freeciv founded 20 years ago today!|accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref> the first playable version was released in January 1996, with bugfixing and small enhancements until April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://download.gna.org/freeciv/stable/OLD/freeciv-1.0a.tar.gz|title=Freeciv 1.0a source code (1996); see DESIGN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://download.gna.org/freeciv/stable/OLD/freeciv-1.0k.tar.gz|title=Freeciv 1.0k source code (1996); see CHANGES}}</ref> The rules of the game were close to Civilization, while the client/server architecture was basically that of XPilot.\n\n[[File:Bigshot.png|thumb|A Freeciv game with full world map revealed (Freeciv version 1.11.5, GTK+ client, tinydent tileset, islands map generator).]]\n\nFor the developers, Freeciv 1.0 was a successful [[proof of concept]], but a rather boring game, so they went back to XPilot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/21/freeciv.html |title='&#39;Building Freeciv: An Open Source Strategy Game'&#39;, by Howard Wen, on linuxdevcenter.com, Nov 21, 2001 |publisher=Linuxdevcenter.com |date= |accessdate=14 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=Freeciv founded 20 years ago today!\n|url=http://play.freeciv.org/blog/2015/11/freeciv-founded-20-years-ago-today/\n|author=Andreas R\u00f8sdal\n|date=2015-11-14\n|accessdate=2017-07-03\n}}</ref>\nOther players and developers took over; they made the game available on many other operating systems, including [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Ultrix]], [[Amiga OS]], and [[Windows|Microsoft Windows]].\nLinux distributions started to include Freeciv.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs/main/f/freeciv/freeciv_2.2.1-1_changelog |title=freeciv_2.2.1-1_changelog |date= |accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe main development goal remained to make a Civilization-like game playable over the Internet, with participants on different continents, even when connected with [[14.4k modem|14400 bit/s]] [[modem]]s.\nFreeciv achieved this by using an [[Asynchrony (computer programming)|asynchronous]] [[client-server]] protocol: during each turn, human users play concurrently, and their actions are sent to the server for processing without awaiting the results.\nThis kept the game playable with [[network latency]] up to a few hundreds of milliseconds.\n \nIn 1998, computer players were added<ref>{{cite web|title=README.AI (r4421)|url=http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/freeciv/branches/S2_1/doc/README.AI?revision=4421&view=markup}}</ref>; they could soon beat newcomers to the game with ease, using only minor forms of cheating.  Computer players are implemented directly in the server; they do not play concurrently with human players, but separately, in between turns.\n\nThe game grew in popularity. A public server was installed on which games could be played around the clock; it retained the games and published a post-game analysis webpage with per-player statistics and an animated map replay.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/Pubserver | title=Pubserver|accessdate=28 November 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite web | url=http://civserver.freeciv.org | title=old snapshots of civserver.freeciv.org (archive.org Wayback Machine) | accessdate=29 November 2011 }}{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://civserver.freeciv.org |date=* }}</ref><ref>{{ cite web | url=http://pubserver.freeciv.org | title=old snapshots of pubserver.freeciv.org archive (archive.org Wayback Machine) | accessdate=29 November 2011 }}{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://pubserver.freeciv.org |date=* }}</ref>\n\nSubsequent 1.x releases improved the GUI, improved the gameplay, and added many small features.\nOver time, the [[critical success factor|winning strategy]] proved to be ''city smallpox'', sprawling the map with many small cities as fast as possible; whoever could develop fastest would win the game, and growing and developing individual cities wasn't worthwhile.\n\nIn practice, from around 2002, experienced players would form teams at the start of the game; a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of Freeciv included specific features for team play.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n  \nVersion 2.0, released in 2005, introduced several important changes: it became beneficial to develop only a few large cities, full trade routes, and advanced technologies by re-balancing various costs and benefits; and the introduction of team playing features and advanced diplomacy made coop gaming more attractive.\n\nDeveloping one's empire now necessitated a careful plan for city development, including phases of ''rapture'', in which city populations grow quickly, under relatively peaceful conditions; hence, games were almost always played in teams and typically took longer to finish when compared to 1.x games.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn 2006, [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] port number 5556 was assigned to Freeciv by [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=5556\n|title=Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry\n|publisher=[[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]\n|date=January 2006\n|accessdate=12 September 2016\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, after being hosted on [[Gna!]] for 15 years, Freeciv moved its [[Repository (version control)|source repository]] to [[GitHub]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170307021144/http://gna.org/projects/freeciv Freeciv project] at [[Gna!]] (archived March 3, 2017)</ref>\n\n== Design ==\nFreeciv is very configurable, down to the specific rules, so it can be played in Freeciv (default) mode, ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' mode, ''[[Civilization II]]'' mode, or a custom mode. One or several players act as game administrators and can configure the game rules. Typically modified rules are:\n\n* Number of players required before the game can be started. The maximum number of players is 126 in the latest version of Freeciv.\n* Speed of technological development\n* Whether there should be computer controlled players\n* Whether (computer controlled) [[barbarian]]s should invade player settlements\n* How close cities can be built to one another\n* How continents and islands are generated and distributed over the map\n* The map size, where the maximum map size is [[int32|2,048,000]] map tiles (128,000 before 2.4.0)\n* Map topology (rectangular or hexagonal tiling; whether it wraps horizontally and/or vertically)\n\nIn order to play a game of Freeciv, a user must start up a Freeciv [[client (computing)|client]] and connect it to a Freeciv [[server (computing)|server]]. Initially, the server is in pre-game phase; in this phase, clients can connect and game configuration parameters can be changed. At some point, the server may be ordered to start a game; in response, it creates game players (nations) and the game map, and assigns every player to either a Freeciv client or a computer player, as specified by the configuration. From that point on, the game will run until it ends or is terminated; the server can never get back into pre-game state.\n\nThe user can also start a game directly from the client: this automatically starts a Freeciv server, connects to it and starts the game.\n\n== Features ==\n[[File:Freeciv2 1-beta1-zh.png|thumb|[[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese]] in version 2.1]]\n\nFreeciv's graphics system is configurable: originally, map display was always in overhead mode (like in ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civ I]]''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.free-games-net.com/games/freeciv.shtml |title=a review on Free Games Net (1998) |publisher=Free-games-net.com |date= |accessdate=14 April 2009 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103220500/http://www.free-games-net.com/games/freeciv.shtml |archivedate=3 January 2009 }}</ref> [[Isometric projection|isometric]] mode (like in ''[[Civilization II|Civ II]]'') and optionally [[hexagonal tiling]] (like in ''[[Civilization V|Civ V]]'') were added later. In both modes, look can be further customized by switching to an alternative set of graphics (called a ''[[Tile set|tileset]]''). The sounds can be replaced as well.\n\nFreeciv supports human-to-human multiplayer gameplay and [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) computer players. While the game is turn based, human players move simultaneously. The AI players move separately, partly at the start of a turn, partly at the end.\n\nIn releases before 2.0, AI players could not engage in diplomatic relationships with human players. Under the current releases, AI players will engage in a very predictable, rules-based diplomacy.\n\nVersion 2.2.0 included a map editor, termed Civworld. It can create new scenarios, as well as edit the map currently being played. Basic scripting is available with Freeciv, but is not available in Civworld.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/Editor |title=Freeciv Editor Page |publisher=Wikia |date= |accessdate=23 February 2010}}</ref> Version 2.3 increased the limit of players from 30 to 126.\n\n[[File:CullamBruce-Lockhart--Dawning_Fanfare.oga|thumb|Dawning fanfare]]\nThere are different clients available [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]], [[GTK+]] (version3) and [[X Athena Widgets|Xaw3D]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://packages.debian.org/search?suite=sid&arch=amd64&searchon=names&keywords=freeciv-client-|title=Debian \u2013 Package Search Results \u2013 freeciv-client-}}</ref> A [[Qt (software)|Qt]] client was added in version 2.5.

Web. 30 Oct. 2010.</ref> who, with his contemporaries [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] and [[Pietro da Cortona]], was a leading figure in the emergence of [[Roman Baroque]] [[architecture]].\n\nA keen student of the architecture of [[Michelangelo]] and the ruins of Antiquity, Borromini developed an inventive and distinctive, if somewhat idiosyncratic, architecture employing manipulations of Classical architectural forms, geometrical rationales in his plans and symbolic meanings in his buildings. He seems to have had a sound understanding of structures, which perhaps Bernini and Cortona, who were principally trained in other areas of the visual arts, lacked. His soft lead drawings are particularly distinctive. He appears to have been a self-taught scholar, amassing a large library by the end of his life.\n\nHis career was constrained by his personality. Unlike Bernini who easily adopted the mantle of the charming courtier in his pursuit of important commissions, Borromini was both melancholic and quick in temper which resulted in him withdrawing from certain jobs,<ref>Blunt, Anthony (1979), ''Borromini'', Harvard University Press, Belknap, p. 21</ref> and his death was by suicide.\n\nProbably because his work was idiosyncratic, his subsequent influence was not widespread but is apparent in the Piedmontese works of [[Camillo-Guarino Guarini]] and, as a fusion with the architectural modes of Bernini and Cortona, in the late Baroque architecture of Northern Europe.<ref>Blunt,(1979), p. 213-7</ref> Later critics of the Baroque, such as [[Francesco Milizia]] and the English architect [[Sir John Soane]], were particularly critical of Borromini's work. From the late nineteenth century onwards, interest has revived in the works of Borromini and his architecture has become appreciated for its inventiveness.\n\n==Early life and first works==\n\nBorromini was born at [[Bissone]],<ref>Later he was also nicknamed \"[[Bissone]]\".</ref> near [[Lugano]] in the [[Ticino]], which was at the time a bailiwick of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]]. He was the son of a stonemason and began his career as a stonemason himself. He soon went to [[Milan]] to study and practice his craft.<ref>He moved to Milano between 1608 and 1614. {{cite web|last=Carboneri|first=Nino|title=Francesco Borromini|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/francesco-borromini_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|work=Dizionario biografico degli Italiani|publisher=Treccani|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref> He moved to [[Rome]] in 1619 and started working for [[Carlo Maderno]], his distant relative, at [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] and then also at the [[Palazzo Barberini]]. When Maderno died in 1629, he and Pietro da Cortona continued to work on the palace under the direction of Bernini. Once he had become established in Rome, he changed his name from Castelli to Borromini, a name deriving from his mother's family and perhaps also out of regard for [[St Charles Borromeo]].<ref>Blunt, Anthony. ''Borromini'', Belknap Harvard, 1979, p. 13</ref>\n\n== Major works ==\n\n=== San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (San Carlino) ===\n{{main|San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane}}\n\n[[File:Roman architecture.jpg|thumb|Fa\u00e7ade of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]].]]\nIn 1634, Borromini received his first major independent commission to design  the church, cloister  and monastic buildings of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] (also known as San Carlino). Situated on the [[Quirinal]] Hill in Rome, the complex was designed for the [[Trinitarian Order|Spanish Trinitarians]], a religious order. The monastic buildings and the cloister were completed first after which construction of the church took place during the period 1638-1641 and in 1646 it was dedicated to San Carlo Borromeo. The church is considered by many to be an exemplary masterpiece of Roman Baroque architecture. San Carlino is remarkably small given its significance to Baroque architecture; it has been noted that the whole building would fit into one of the dome piers of [[Saint Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]].<ref>As [[Siegfried Giedion]] pointed out in ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (1941 etc.)</ref><ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/annenberg/asc/projects/comm544/library/images/040.html Plan of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www2.siba.fi/~kkoskim//rooma/pages/SCARLOQU.HTM S. Carlo alle Quattro Fontane<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \n \nThe site was not an easy one; it was a corner site and the space was limited. Borromini positioned the church on the corner of two intersecting roads. Although the idea for the serpentine facade must have been conceived fairly early on, probably in the mid-1630s, it was only constructed towards the end of Borromini's life and the upper part was not completed until after the architect's death.\n\nBorromini devised the complex ground plan of the church from interlocking geometrical configurations, a typical Borromini device for constructing plans. The resulting effect is that the interior lower walls appear to weave in and out, partly alluding to a cross form, partly to a hexagonal form and partly to an oval form; geometrical figures  that are all found explicitly in the dome above.<ref>Steinberg L.  ''San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane. A Study in Multiple Form and Architectural Symbolism''. New York 1977, p 117 and Fig. 85. The effect has been noted by others that he \"designed the walls to weave in and out as if they were formed not of stone but of pliant substance set in motion by an energetic space, carrying with them the deep entablatures, the cornices, moldings and pediments\" (Trachtenberg & Hyman)</ref><ref>[http://web.comhem.se/~u13117202/scarlino.htm San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The  area of the pendentives marks the transition from the lower wall order to the oval opening of the dome. Illuminated by windows hidden from a viewer below, interlocking octagons, crosses and hexagons diminish in size as the dome rises to a lantern with the symbol of the Trinity.\n\n=== Oratory of Saint Phillip Neri (Oratorio dei Filippini) ===\n{{main|Oratorio dei Filippini}}\n\n[[File:Oratorio dei Filippini Rome.jpg|thumb|Oratory of Saint Phillip Neri]]\nIn the late sixteenth century, the Congregation of the Filippini (also known as the Oratorians) rebuilt the church of [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]] (known as the Chiesa Nuova -new church) in central Rome. In the 1620s, on a site adjacent to the church, the Fathers commissioned designs for their own residence and for an oratory (or ''oratorio'' in Italian) in which to hold their spiritual exercises. These exercises combined preaching and music in a form which became immensely popular and highly influential on the development of the musical oratorio.\n\nThe architect [[Paolo Maruscelli]] drew up plans for the site (which survive) and the sacristy was begun in 1629 and was in use by 1635. After a substantial benefaction in January 1637, however, Borromini was appointed as architect.<ref>See Connors J., ''Borromini and the Roman Oratory: Style and Society'', New York, London & Cambridge (Massachusetts), 1980, and [[Kerry Downes]], ''Averlo format perfettamente: Borromini's first two years at the Roman Oratory'', ''Architectural History'', 57 (2012), pp. 109-39. </ref> By 1640, the oratory was in use, a taller and richer clock tower was accepted, and by 1643, the relocated library was complete. The striking brick curved facade adjacent to the church entrance has an unusual pediment and does not entirely correspond to the oratory room behind it.  The white oratory interior has a ribbed vault and a complex wall arrangement of engaged pilasters along with freestanding columns supporting first level balconies. The altar wall was substantially reworked at a later date.\n\nBorromini\u2019s relations with the Oratorians were often fraught; there were heated arguments over the design and the selection of building materials. By 1650, the situation came to a head and in 1652 the Oratorians appointed another architect.\n\nHowever, with the help of his Oratorian friend and provost [[Virgilio Spada]], Borromini documented his own account of the building of the oratory and the residence and an illustrated version was published in Italian in 1725 <ref>For an English translation of the 1725 edition and discussion of the architecture see Kerry Downes,''Borromini\u2019s Book'', Oblong Creative, 2010</ref>\n{{Commons category|Francesco Borromini}}\n\n[[File:Borromini SantIvo.jpg|thumb|Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza, courtyard and fa\u00e7ade.]]\n\n=== Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza ===\n\nFrom 1640-1650, he worked on the design of the church of [[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]] and its courtyard, near [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] palace. It was initially the church of the Roman [[Archiginnasio]]. He had been initially recommended for the commission in 1632, by his then supervisor for the work at the Palazzo Barberini, [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. The site, like many in cramped Rome, is challenged for external perspectives. It was built at the end of [[Giacomo della Porta]]'s long courtyard. The dome and cochlear steeple are peculiar, and reflect the idiosyncratic architectural motifs that distinguish Borromini from contemporaries. Inside, the nave has an unusual centralized plan circled by alternating concave and convex-ending cornices, leading to a dome decorated with linear arrays of stars and putti. The geometry of the structure is a symmetric six-pointed star; from the center of the floor, the cornice looks like a two equilateral triangles forming a hexagon, but three of the points are clover-like, while the other three are concavely clipped. The innermost columns are points on a circle. The fusion of feverish and dynamic baroque excesses with a rationalistic geometry is an excellent match for a church in a papal institution of higher learning.\n\n=== Sant'Agnese in Agone ===\n{{main|Sant'Agnese in Agone}}\n\nBorromini was one of several architects involved in the building of the church of Sant\u2019Agnese in Agone in Rome. Not only were some of his design intentions changed by succeeding architects but the net result is a building which reflects, rather unhappily, a mix of different approaches.\n\nThe decision to rebuild of the church was taken in 1652 as part of Pope [[Innocent X]]\u2019s project to enhance the [[Piazza Navona]], the urban space onto which his family palace, the [[Palazzo Pamphili]], faced. The first plans for a Greek Cross church were drawn up by [[Girolamo Rainaldi]] and his son [[Carlo Rainaldi]], who relocated the main entrance from the Via di [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]] to the Piazza Navona. The foundations were laid and much of the lower level walls had been constructed when the Rainaldis were dismissed due to criticisms of the design and Borromini was appointed in their stead.<ref>Blunt A. ''Borromini'', Belknap Press of Harvard University, 1979, 157</ref>\n\nBorromini began a much more innovative approach to the facade which was expanded to include parts of the adjacent Palazzo Pamphili and gain space for his two bell towers.<ref>Each of the constructed bell towers has a clock,  one for Roman time, the other for ''tempo ultramontano'' or European time</ref> Construction of the fa\u00e7ade proceeded up to the cornice level and the dome completed as far as the lantern. On the interior, he placed columns against the piers of the lower order which was mainly completed.\n\nIn 1656, Innocent X died and the project lost momentum. In 1657, Borromini resigned and Carlo Rainaldi was recalled who made a number of significant changes to Borromini's design. Further alterations were made by Bernini including the fa\u00e7ade pediment. In 1668, Carlo Rainaldi returned as architect and [[Ciro Ferri]] received the commission to fresco the dome interior which it is highly unlikely that Borromini intended. Further large scale statuary and coloured marbling were also added; again, these are not part of Borromini's design repertoire which was orientated to white stucco architectural and symbolic motifs.<ref>Blunt, 1979,159-160</ref>\n\n===The Re Magi Chapel of the Propaganda Fide===\n{{main|Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples}}\n\nThe College of the Propagation of the Faith or Propaganda Fide in Rome includes the Re Magi Chapel by Borromini, generally considered by architectural historians to be one of his most spatially unified architectural interiors.<ref>See, Magnuson, T. ''Rome in the Age of Bernini'', Vol 2, 207</ref>\n\nThe chapel replaced a small oval chapel designs by his rival Bernini and was a late work in Borromini's career; he was appointed as architect in 1648 but it was not until 1660 that construction of the chapel began and although the main body of work was completed by 1665, some of the decoration was finished after his death.\n\nHis fa\u00e7ade to the Via di Propaganda Fide comprises seven bays articulated by giant pilasters. The central bay is a concave curve and accommodates the main entry into the college courtyard and complex, with the entrance to the chapel to the left and to the college to the right.\n\n== Other works ==\nBorromini's works include:\n*Interior of [[Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano]]\n*Cappella Spada, San Girolamo della Carit\u00e0 (uncertain attribution)\n*[[Palazzo Spada]] (trick perspective)\n*[[Palazzo Barberini]] (upper-level windows and oval staircase)\n*[[Santi Apostoli, Naples]] - Filamarino Altar\n*[[Sant'Andrea delle Fratte]]\n*[[Oratorio dei Filippini]]\n*[[Congregatio de Propaganda Fide|Collegio de Propaganda Fide]]<ref>[http://www.romeartlover.it/Vasi164a.htm Collegio di Propaganda Fide<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*[[Santa Maria dei Sette Dolori, Rome]]\n*[[Santa Maria alla Porta, Milan]]  - portal and tympanum\n*[[San Giovanni in Oleo]] (restoration)\n*[[Palazzo Giustiniani, Rome|Palazzo Giustiniani]] (with [[Carlo Fontana]])\n*Facade of [[Palazzo Falconieri]]\n*[[Santa Lucia in Selci]] (restoration)\n*[[Saint Peter's Basilica]] (gates to Blessed Sacrament Chapel and possibly parts of baldacchino)\n\n==Death and epitaph==\nIn the summer of 1667, and following completion of the Falconieri chapel (the High Altar chapel) in [[San Giovanni dei Fiorentini]],  Borromini committed suicide in Rome,<ref>[http://web.comhem.se/~u13117202/suicide.htm Borromini's suicide]</ref> possibly as a result of nervous disorders and depression.\n\nIn his testament, Borromini wrote that he did not want any name on his burial and expressed the desire to be buried in the tomb of his kinsman Carlo Maderno in San Giovanni dei Fiorentini. In recent times, his name was added on the marble plaque below the tomb of Maderno and a commemorative plaque commissioned by the Swiss embassy in Rome was placed on a pillar of the church.

Edgar Hoover]] served as FBI Director from 1924 to 1972, a combined 48 years with the BOI, DOI, and FBI. He was chiefly responsible for creating the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory, or the [[FBI Laboratory]], which officially opened in 1932, as part of his work to professionalize investigations by the government. Hoover was substantially involved in most major cases and projects that the FBI handled during his tenure. But as detailed below, his proved to be a highly controversial tenure as Bureau Director, especially in its later years. After Hoover's death, the Congress passed legislation that limited the tenure of future FBI Directors to ten years.\n\nEarly homicide investigations of the new agency included the [[Osage Indian murders]].  During the \"War on Crime\" of the 1930s, FBI agents apprehended or killed a number of notorious criminals who carried out kidnappings, robberies, and murders throughout the nation, including [[John Dillinger]], [[Baby Face Nelson|\"Baby Face\" Nelson]], [[Ma Barker|Kate \"Ma\" Barker]], [[Alvin Karpis|Alvin \"Creepy\" Karpis]], and [[Machine Gun Kelly|George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly]].\n\nOther activities of its early decades included a decisive role in reducing the scope and influence of the white supremacist group [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Additionally, through the work of [[Edwin Atherton]], the BOI claimed to have successfully apprehended an entire army of Mexican neo-revolutionaries under the leadership of General Enrique Estrada in the mid-1920s, east of San Diego, California.\n\nHoover began using [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]] in the 1920s during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] to arrest bootleggers.<ref name=\"hnn\">{{cite news |title=Civil Rights: Let 'Em Wiretap! |last=Greenberg |first=David |authorlink=David Greenberg |date=October 22, 2001 |publisher=History News Network |url=http://hnn.us/articles/366.html |accessdate=February 15, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301212237/http://hnn.us/articles/366.html |archivedate=March 1, 2011 |df= }}</ref> In the 1927 case ''[[Olmstead v.

Charles, the FBI's \"sex deviates\" program began on April 10, 1950, when J. Edgar Hoover forwarded the White House, U.S. Civil Service Commission, and branches of the armed services a list of 393 alleged federal employees who were allegedly arrested in Washington, D.C., since 1947, on charges of \"sexual irregularities\". On June 20, 1951, Hoover expanded the program by issuing a memo establishing a \"uniform policy for the handling of the increasing number of reports and allegations concerning present and past employees of the United State Government who assertedly [sic] are sex deviates.\" The program was expanded to include non-government jobs. According to [[Athan Theoharis]], \"In 1951 he [Hoover] had unilaterally instituted a Sex Deviates program to purge alleged homosexuals from any position in the federal government, from the lowliest clerk to the more powerful position of White house aide.\" On May 27, 1953, [[Executive Order 10450]] went into effect. The program was expanded further by this executive order by making all federal employment of homosexuals illegal. On July 8, 1953, the FBI forwarded to the U.S. Civil Service Commission information from the sex deviates program. In 1977\u20131978, 300,000 pages, collected between 1930 to the mid-1970s, in the sex deviates program were destroyed by FBI officials.<ref>[http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/fbi-history/1950-1959 FBI and Homosexuality: 1950-1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204172602/http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/fbi-history/1950-1959 |date=December 4, 2017 }}</ref><ref>[http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/fbi-history/1970-1979 FBI and Homosexuality: 1970-1979 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605032719/http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/fbi-history/1970-1979 |date=June 5, 2018 }}</ref><ref>[http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/fbi-history/2010-2019 FBI and Homosexuality: 2010-2019] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204171135/http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/fbi-history/2010-2019 |date=December 4, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n====Civil rights movement====\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, FBI officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders, whom they believed either had communist ties or were unduly influenced by communists or \"[[fellow traveller]]s.\" In 1956, for example, Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr. [[T.

The book blamed the FBI's decentralized structure, which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices. The book suggested that the FBI had not evolved into an effective counter-terrorism or counter-intelligence agency, due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change.

In 2003, its National Research Council published a report whose conclusions called into question 30 years of FBI testimony.

The UCR focuses its data collection on violent crimes, hate crimes, and property crimes.<ref name=\"pubs\" /> Created in the 1920s, the UCR system has not proven to be as ''uniform'' as its name implies. The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense in the case of connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape. Since about 93% of the data submitted to the FBI is in this format, the UCR stands out as the publication of choice as most states require law enforcement agencies to submit this data.\n\nPreliminary Annual ''Uniform Crime Report'' for 2006 was released on June 4, 2006. The report shows violent crime offenses rose 1.3%, but the number of property crime offenses decreased 2.9% compared to 2005.<ref name=\"publications_ucr2006\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/06prelim/index.html |title=Preliminary Crime Statistics for 2006 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411123900/http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/06prelim/index.html |archivedate=April 11, 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====National Incident-Based Reporting System====\n{{Main|National Incident-Based Reporting System}}\nThe National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) [[crime statistics]] system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data. The system is used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes. Local, state, and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems. Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category. The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories. Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system. In addition to the Group A offenses, eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information. The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary-based UCR system. {{as of|2004|df=US}}, 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data. That amount represents 20% of the United States population and 16% of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI.\n\n==eGuardian==\neGuardian is the name of an FBI system, launched in January 2009, to share tips about possible terror threats with local police agencies.

Each star is assigned a number and the Latin [[genitive]] of the [[constellation]] it lies in (see [[88 modern constellations]] for a list of constellations and the genitive forms of their names). Flamsteed designations were assigned to 2554 stars. The numbers were originally assigned in order of increasing [[right ascension]] within each constellation, but due to the effects of [[precession]] they are now slightly out of order in some places.\n\nThis method of designating stars first appeared in a preliminary version of [[John Flamsteed]]'s ''[[Historia Coelestis Britannica]]'' published by [[Edmond Halley]] and [[Isaac Newton]] in 1712 without Flamsteed's approval.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/ | title = Naming Astronomical Objects\n | publisher = [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU)\n | accessdate = 2015-09-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://spider.seds.org/spider/Misc/naming.html | title = Naming Stars\n | publisher = [[Students for the Exploration and Development of Space]] (SEDS)\n | accessdate = 2009-01-30 }}</ref> The final version of Flamsteed's catalogue published in 1725<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Flamsteed |title=Historia Coelestis Britannica |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4K9FAAAAcAAJ|publisher=H.

Where a Bayer designation with a Greek letter does exist for a star, it is usually used in preference to the Flamsteed designation. (Flamsteed numbers are generally preferred to Bayer designations with ''Roman'' letters.) Examples of well-known stars that are usually referred to by their Flamsteed numbers include [[51 Pegasi]], and [[61 Cygni]]. Flamsteed designations are often used instead of the Bayer designation if the latter contains an extra attached number; for example, \"[[55 Cancri]]\" is more common than \"Rho-1 Cancri\".\n\nThere are examples of stars, such as [[10 Ursae Majoris]] in [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]], bearing Flamsteed designations for constellations in which they do not lie, just as there are for Bayer designations, because of the compromises that had to be made when the modern constellation boundaries were drawn up.\n\nFlamsteed's catalogue covered only the stars visible from [[Great Britain]], and therefore stars of the far southern constellations have no Flamsteed numbers. Some stars, such as the nearby star 82 Eridani, were named in a major southern-hemisphere catalog called ''Uranometria Argentina'', by [[Benjamin Gould]]; these are [[Gould designation|Gould numbers]], rather than Flamsteed numbers, and should be differentiated with a G, as in [[82 G. Eridani]]. Except for a handful of cases, Gould numbers are not in common use.  Similarly, Flamsteed-like designations assigned by other astronomers (for example, [[Hevelius]]) are no longer in general use. (A well-known exception is the [[globular cluster]] [[47 Tucanae]] from [[Johann Elert Bode|Bode]]'s catalog.)\n\n84 stars entered in Flamsteed's catalog are errors and proved not to exist in the sky:<ref name=wagman/> All of them except 11 Vulpeculae were plotted on his star charts.\n* Flamsteed observed [[Uranus]] in 1690 but did not recognize it as a [[planet]] and entered it into his catalog as a star called \"34 Tauri\".\n* [[11 Vulpeculae]] was a nova, now known as [[CK Vulpeculae]].\n* Many of them were caused by arithmetic errors made by Flamsteed.\n\n==List of constellations using Flamsteed star designations==\nThere are 52 constellations that primarily use Flamsteed designations.

For example, a search for 'demon' will list all pages that use the word 'demonstrate' (case-insensitive substring match?). That's okay now, but as the wikipedia grows the lists of false matches will get longer and more searches will be affected by it. A power search would provide options for boolean expressions, exact-phrase, case-sensitivity, etc. --[[User:Atlas_2091|Atlas_2091]]\n** I second that motion. Attempts to outsource \n**:''See also :'' [[Feature requests]]<nowiki>OddlyCapitalized</nowiki> links would be helped greatly by a case-sensitive search, so one does not, for instance, have to search through 149 pages with the word \"liberal\" looking for the ones that are printed \n**:''See also :'' [[Feature requests]]<nowiki>LiberaL</nowiki>. Of course, the point is moot if 0.92 will include tools to rename pages (and references to them) automatically. --KQ\n** A regexp-like search option might be handy...\n** I would like the search to return those pages more prominently whose title matches the search string. First give me the title matches, then the article body matches.\n** Searches currently turn up only the exact phrase entered, which should probably be one option among many. For an example why, search for \n**:''See also :'' [[Feature requests]]<nowiki>\"John A. MacDonald,\" \"John A MacDonald,\" \"John MacDonald,\" \"John D Macdonald,\" and \"John D. MacDonald.\"</nowiki>\n* Since I have forgotten what happened in the far past (more than the time that shows up in recent changes) I want other ways to look for articles:\n*: Articles sorted by inverse date (show oldest first) - just so I can do a sanity check on things that might have been overlooked.\n*: Articles sorted by number of revisions (lowest first} - If it never got revised, it probably needs work unless Larry wrote it. :) -- [[User:mike dill|mike dill]]\n\n==== Interface ====\n\n* Eventually, a feature to find non-linked mentions of pages could also be useful. --CliffordAdams\n* Anchors (HTML standard) to jump around in a page! Often the text shouldn\u00b4t be split but retain its flow, and yet have some navigation and structure, e.g. \"contents\" \n\n\n==== Report features and automation ====\n\n* Similar to the [[Wikipedia:What Google liked|What Google Likes|]] page and the request above: a report for pages visited most often (aside from, say, the [[Special:Recentchanges|Recent Changes]] and HomePage pages and other usual suspects). (So busybodies like me can know frequently-visited areas possibly wanting improvement.)\n* Generate and place on an automatically-generated R/O page a list of the most popular Wikipedia searches. This would encourage people to write articles specifically on those topics that people search for. --[[User:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]]\n** This would probably be easiest to do outside of the wiki script by processing the server's logs.\n* A script to autogenerate the [[Wikipedia:What Google liked|What Google Likes]] page once a day or so\n* There are several pages that have comments like \"as of (date) we have NNN pages / MMM comma pages...\". This information becomes stale pretty quickly. Would it be practical to provide a [[Wikipedia:Statistics|Wikipedia Statistics]] page that could be updated fairly often with things like page counts, web server stats, user stats, etc.? <small>--[[User:hornlo|loh]] (2001-06-21)</small>\n\n==== Naming conventions ====\n\n* Use of (at least) Latin1 characters in links and titles of pages. I can see this vexing the Anglo-American crowd, but it's truly annoying to spell your name in a faulty way, and even more so to spell historical persons wrong.\n** This is already a feature of UseMod 0.92, which is currently in use by the international Wikipedias. When we get around to updating the software here as well, that will come along. --LDC\n\n==== Wikipedia distribution etc. ====\n\n* Since the text within Wikipedia is covered by the GNU FDL there is a requirement that it be available in the most \"transparent\" form. I would suggest that since the publically viewable form of is HTML but the underlying dataset is stored in the wiki source form it is currently not available in a transparent form. I guess that it is possible to gather this data by using the \"edit\" button of all the documents and culling the information from the text field, but again this is not very transparent. Even if you do this, you still have lost the version information which could be argued to be a fundamental part of the data. Is there a plan to provide a download format from which a new copy of the data in wikipedia can be generated? -[[User:Phillip2|Phillip2]]\n**At present, no plan, but we would like to do this, of course.\n** I also think this would be a nice service. -- BryceHarrington\n\n----\n\n=== Solved ===\n* Missed searches - user searches that returned no results (from [[Wikipedia-L]])\n* Articles sorted by size - so i know where the articles that need work are.\n* Could we move the search box higher up the screen? It is hard to find right now.\n** I second that, and propose that its placement be made a user preference: top, bottom, or both. --Gimbo\n* Each Wikipedia page could and should have a Talk subpage why not making it default for every new page. [[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]]\n** Seconded. I like the idea of making a default /Talk on each (non-sub)page.\n* Clicking the name of the article at the top of the page searches for occurrences of the page title on other pages, but it would be possibly more useful for that to point to a list of all the pages that ''link to'' the page in question. There doesn't seem to be any way to do that at present. --[[User:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]]\n** This is likely to be added eventually, and may even become the default behavior of the page-title link. This was not much of a problem with the old WikiName links because those titles were automatically links. Now with \"free links\" there may be several pages that use a page title but do not link to it. --CliffordAdams\n* We need a way to let ordinary folks ''upload'' files to the Wikipedia server--perhaps the uploads would first have to be hand-processed, to make sure they don't carry viruses and aren't too large. But eventually, it seems to me we're going to need something like this. (Perhaps it wouldn't have to be closely integrated with UseModWiki software, though. We could just link to a Wikipedia upload page, which would run our own unique software.) --[[User:LMS|LMS]]\n** I'm quite surprised you don't have a file uploader, actually. I can send you the one used in the WorldForge website: http://www.worldforge.org/website/tools/upload_a_file. I'd be willing to collaborate on adapting this for Wikipedia if there is interest (I will need a similar tool for work soon). -- BryceHarrington\n** TWiki has the notion of adding attachements to a page that can be referenced within that page. IMHO, something similar would be very useful for Wikipedia.\n** Uploading images would be great to build an illustrated encyclopedia :-)\n** Uploading files is only half of the problem.  We need a way to refer to those files from within articles, that is a easy to use as [[Wikipedia:Free Links|Free Links]].  Right now they are fully-qualified URLs, which is a pain to type and also is non-transportable.  (Renaming uploaded files would be handy also.)  --[[User:Alan Millar|Alan Millar]]\n\n:''See also :'' [[Wikipedia:Phase II feature requests]]", "sha1": "07ixar21yyxzwo8fzj04es86br0fy04"}}, {"title": "Wikipedia:Phase II feature requests/Report features", "ns": "4", "id": "11131", "revision": {"id": "482776569", "parentid": "382877443", "timestamp": "2012-03-19T20:03:59Z", "contributor": {"username": "Yobot", "id": "7328338"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Report features */[[WP:CHECKWIKI]] error  fixes + [[WP:GENFIXES|general fixes]] using [[Project:AWB|AWB]] (8032)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''This page is obsolete!'''\nIt is an archive of old feature requests that were still active on 2002 July 20, when we moved from Phase II to Phase III of the software.\nMany requests were implemented then, while others became obsolete due to being rejected by the community.\n'''See [[Wikipedia:Feature requests]] for current requests.'''\n----\n\n=== Report features ===\n\n* Automatically-generated NewTopics page\n** Still considering this, but not for version 0.92. --CliffordAdams\n\n* Count and publicly display (somewhere) two or three different numbers of Wikipedia pages that are longer than various particulars lengths (to give a more realistic idea of how many actual pages are on the wiki, as opposed to redirection pages, tiny stubs, etc.).\n** A good idea.

Also, not all of the requested information is kept permanently. --CliffordAdams\n\n* It would be great to have a feature that would identify all orphaned pages. There's a small but growing problem of our having many useful pages that are not linked-to or underlinked-to. It would be great if we could list all pages to which there are no links, or only one link. --[[User:Larry Sanger]]\n\n* I would like a page that is a top list of the most frequently linked-to non-existent page, more or less the opposite. [[User:Linus Tolke]]\n\n* How about a feature that lists all places where the current page is linked from?\n\n* Provide a [[batch job]] that searches for and lists all links along with the page the link is contained in so that we can look for duplicate/slightly different versions of the same link and fix them. Please make this a weekly batch job so that it does not take too much time.\n\n* Is it possible to invent something to sort lists alphabetically? Take a look at pages like [[Actresses]] and you know why this would be helpful...\n\n* Plagiarism-bot. A bot that goes through Wikipedia pages on a regular basis, does Google searches, and flags pages that it suspects might be plagiarized.\n\n* Spell check [[batch job]] for newly created articles once a week with a link at the end of the article to the incorrectly spelled words. Even better would be one that worked as the \"preview\" button, before saving, and that marked somehow the suspicious words.\n\n* Let's have contributors of a given Wikipedia page listed either in the header or in the footer. IP's are skipped of course and if there are more than, say, 10 contributors make a link to a special subpage \"Contributors\".[[User:Kpjas]]\n** If people wish to be listed, can't they simply include their name at the end of the text?\n\n* Provide a way to search for all the changes made by one user in Wikipedia. For example, if I contributed to numerous pages over a long period of time, then 2 years later, I would need a way to find out whether someone else added to the subject I once touched.\n\n\n:''See also :'' [[Wikipedia:Phase II feature requests]]", "sha1": "aa5dpanxlpif1fky3gmuu53zog31sa6"}}, {"title": "Wikipedia:Phase II feature requests/Naming conventions", "ns": "4", "id": "11132", "revision": {"id": "382874818", "parentid": "382874759", "timestamp": "2010-09-04T14:12:11Z", "contributor": {"username": "Graham87", "id": "194203"}, "minor": "", "comment": "moved [[MediaWiki talk:Feature requests/Naming conventions]] to [[Wikipedia:Phase II feature requests/Naming conventions]] over redirect: revert", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''This page is obsolete!'''\nIt is an archive of old feature requests that were still active on 2002 July 20, when we moved from Phase II to Phase III of the software.\nMany requests were implemented then, while others became obsolete due to being rejected by the community.\n'''See [[Wikipedia:Feature requests]] for current requests.'''\n----\n\n<h3>Naming conventions (this is all done, but not yet implemented on Wikipedia)</h3> \n\n* The wiki software could be written so that, for example, if I write <code>[[andy jewell]]</code>, <code>[[Andy jewell]]</code>, <code>[[andy Jewell]]</code>, or <code>[[Andy Jewell]]</code>, the page linked to will always be <code>Andy_Jewell</code>. In that case, one would be able to capitalize or not in the text of wiki articles at one's pleasure, and only the titles of articles would look strange (in some cases, e.g., <code>Ich_Bin_Ein_Berliner</code>). But that situation would be preferable to the current situation, in which some people are capitalizing second and third words of article titles, when, in referring to the subject of the article, one doesn't ordinarily capitalize those words. (For discussion, see [[naming conventions]].) -- [[User:Larry Sanger]]\n** This has been done in version 0.92. The canonical form of a page will have all words capitalized, and links can have arbitrary words capitalized. This will be a little strange sometimes, but it seems to be the best solution for now.\n** Ooh, that sounds awful. I hope that's not what'd going to happen, since it violates the [[naming conventions]]. --[[User:The Cunctator]]\n\n* Now that we have [[Wikipedia:Free Links|Free Links]], can we have the canonization software allow parentheses, so we can use titles with short glosses rather than awkward compounds, e.g., [[Nirvana (musical group)]] rather than [[NirvanaBand]]? The downside of this is a little more typing to make a link; the upside is that we get to have titles in plain English. --[[User:Lee Daniel Crocker]] and [[User:Larry Sanger]] (see [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation]])\n** This is in version 0.92. I was surprised to see that parentheses ''are'' allowed in URIs/URLs according to RFC 2396, so it shouldn't be hard to add them. --CliffordAdams\n\n* There's a good reason why we can't use single quotes in titles, right? It sure would be handy to have the use of them, though.\n** After more thought, I've given in on this request also. Single quotes are allowed in 0.92. Please don't ask for any more punctuation, however, or I may scream. :-) --CliffordAdams\n*** How about backticks and semicolons? (joke!)\n\n*Can we please turn off automatic subpages? I'm not suggesting we ''disallow'' subpages, only that the software not assume that anything following a slash, even if it's not in brackets, should be a subpage: currently aspirin/Tylenol; Marat/Sade; and Face/Off all want to make a subpage of [[Feature requests]]. CSCE/OSCE did want to make one on one of the Hungary pages, but for some reason doesn't do it here.

Everytime I hit \"preferences\" otherwise, I get a new user ID.\n\n* I noticed last weekend that I can set my ID in Preferences to anybody else's, certainly, if they are not using it. I would not care if people had mutlyiple IDs. But, I do see a problem in my setting my ID to, say [[Larry Sanger]] and entering content all over which will wrongly be identified as his in recent changes. And possibly elsewhere. RoseParks\n** There is a secure user-ID already--it is the \"User ID number\" shown on the Preferences page. If you are using recent versions of MSIE or Netscape you can see the ID number and the IP address by moving the mouse over the user name. (A popup saying something like \"ID 1622 from 165.79.13.xxx\" should appear.) It should be non-trivial for anyone else to use that ID number, since it protected by a random number in the user's cookie (which is compared with a copy on the server). Eventually a more conventional username/password combination may become an option, but this is unlikely to happen soon. --CliffordAdams (or somebody with ID 1675 :-)\n** I second the request for a more conventional username/password combination. This is one thing necessary to make the website fully scaleable. --[[User:LMS]]\n\n* The \".xxx\" bit in dynamic IP addresses is commendable, but is there a way to do something similar for people logging in from institutions with static IP addresses ending in letters? The last one I saw listed the entire address. Certainly anyone with a static IP should have a firewall, but I think we've seen enough mischievous people wander through that the precaution of masking the IP still has merit. And no that's not a rhetorical question, as I'll be logging on from a static IP starting in early June 2002. --KQ\n\nI'm not sure \"privacy\" is a good thing here. The price one pays for freedom is accountability: anyone should be able to edit anything, but I don't think they should be able to do so without being identified (at least with their chosen pseudonym--they can still hide behind whatever anonymity their Internet connection gives them). When I find some vandalism, for example, I look back in the Recent Changes list for that same IP and check those pages--I usually find more. Likewise, when I get to know certain posters, I get to know what might be interesting or important to read. If someone is concerned about privacy, that's ''his'' problem, and he should take the burden of using software to anonymize himself (and there's plenty of software available to do that). --[[User:Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]\n\n* I, for one, do not care about [[anonymity]] here, but [[pseudonymity]] would be fine. We almost have the latter with userids, were it not for the \"from IP-Address\" misfeature. LDC, if you know that userid 715 broke a page, is it really harder to find all other pages touched by them without knowing three octets of their IP? The main use I see for that is correlating pseudonyms to realnames, which is mainly useful for prosecution (I don't assume that we want to criminalize WikiVandals, though), or ... direct marketing. --Robbe\n\nI think you've misunderstood. What I'm talking about specifically is not having the ''entire'' static IP address shown of someone logging in from an address ending in letters. All it would take is to .xxx a portion of it so that the firewall is not constantly fending off requests. This is the same courtesy already extended to people logging in from any IP address ending in numerals. My concern for it stems from the fact that it identifies where the person works or attends school, which if you'll pardon my saying so, is not necessarily anyone's business. If it's not workable then you can expect to have me not continue contributing. --KQ\n\nI usually use a static IP, but [[Recent Changes]] (hover over my name) only shows a masked IP, not my domain.\nDid you see this on the main Wikipedia, or one of the internationals?\nUseModWiki can turn off name lookup, and I'd assumed from the RC display that it was turned off.\n\nYou're asking that ''mybox.frobnuts.com'' be masked as ''mybox.'''''xxx.xxx''',\n(which is a ''domain name'' rather than an ''ip address'', to be unnecessarily picky)\nso that FrobNuts's network (thus their firewall) won't be identifiable?\n\nEven the current method really doesn't provide that level of protection,\nor much privacy of any kind beyond a casual glance.\nFor example, ''111.222.333.444'' would display as \"''111.222.333.'''''xxx'''\",\nand thus \"hide\" a specific host, but the network can likely still be identified\nvia a simple whois lookup on \"111.222.333\". With my usual IP address,\nthe two leading numbers are sufficient to tell you where I'm logged in from; you don't even\nneed the third one. In general, only a residential poster would have some anonymity,\nsimply because the ip address (whether static or dynamic) usually maps\nback to the ISP, not a specific business or school.\n\nTo achieve the equivalent level of privacy you're asking for, even the ip addresses should be\nmasked as '''xxx.xxx.xxx'''''.444'' rather than as they are now.\n--[[User:hornlo|loh]]\n\n:I second the reverse masking of the IP addresses--it still allows identification, but not by geography, etc. Though you'd probably need more than just the last three to make people in dynamic IP networks id'able. eh. no perfect answer. -- TheCunctator\n\nInteresting. I don't remember if it was on the English wikipedia or the Spanish one; it's been some months past. I had two concerns; one ''was'' indeed not giving the entire IP address (or domain name); the other was not revealing immediately where contributors post from, leaving it instead to their own discretion. I haven't seen it again; but if it was originally from the Spanish wikipedia that would be because I've contributed nearly all I can in Spanish. :-) I expect that I'll try it from another computer to see how it displays and will be using anonymizer or somesuch if it's not to my satisfaction.

That way we can get a much more accurate count of the number of articles. A link or drop down box at the bottom of a page would allow changes to the page type, which should show up in the revision log. -- [[User:Simon J Kissane|Simon J Kissane]]\n* Automate renaming of pages. I'm sick of copying and pasting and putting in #REDIRECTs. There should be a rename command which creates a copy of the page with the new name, and replaces the old page with a #REDIRECT to the new page. And it should be able to move all subpages (e.g. /Talk pages) as well. -- [[User:Simon J Kissane|Simon J Kissane]]\n* Can we omit /Talk pages from those returned by [[Random Page]] (or at least a user option so to do)\" -- [[User:GWO|GWO]]\n**Could we exclude #REDIRECT pages from \"Random Page\" results--make it, uh, why not \"Random article\"? (Maybe exclude user pages too?) Or perhaps add that as an option under prefs?[[user:Koyaanis Qatsi|Koyaanis Qatsi]]\n* I'm not sure if this is a software feature request or a feature request for the sysadmin, but can we make the description metatag for all Wikipedia pages identical to the first 25-40 words of the page contents?\n* Disallow self-referencing wiki links. It is counterproductive to the idea of a cross-linked encyclopedia to link the page the user is currently on to the page the user is currently on. One can easily kill these links when one comes across them, but perhaps it would be easier to simply disallow it in the wiki code?\n** I think the idea here is not to ''parse'' a link on the XYZ to the XYZ page as a link.\n* There should be a diff between two adjacent changes. The current diff only shows the change from a given version to the latest version. It would be useful to diff version 1 with version 2, version 2 with version 3, ..., version 14 with version 15 etc. Not version 1 to version 15.\n* I'd like a more precise \"diff\" feature. Currently if there's a change in a paragraph you have to scan the entire paragraph to find it. Could we mark the changes themselves in some way?\n**I second for this feature. I recently suggested a convention used in entering text on the FAQ page. If each sentence is entered on its own line, the diff will show only the sentence that is changed instead of the whole paragraph. However, if Wikipedia's diff can use color to highlight the changes within the paragraph, then it would work better than what I suggested.\n* Let users \"subscribe\" to a page: every change to that page will then be emailed to them. AxelBoldt\n**I like this idea very much, but how about sending a daily/weekly/monthly digest instead of one message per change? This would be '''very''' nice. [[User:sandos|sandos]]\n* the Wikie (erlang wiki) allows for passworded pages, and append-only pages, as well as marked sections as well. These are rather useful as well. The primary use, in my mind, for this wiki would be quoting material from somewhere else, like the US constitution, the text of a speech, the exact program code to do something...\n* Images should automatically be aligned to the left (align=\"left\") so that text wraps around it. Or something. Check out [[Galileo]]. There is a huge white space even on 800x600. \n* A standardized method to include grants of permission from sources of copyrighted material, plus a detail on [[fair_use]] implied consent on copyrighted material. A statement that this wikipedia.com is either for commercial or educational purposes might help !\n* Tag that would allow Tex Math mode. Like in < formula >F = frac{GMm}{r^2}< / formula >.

PG is a library of books that have fallen into the public domain. Include them as links to the specific .txt files on PG's servers, so we don't have to deal with the endless defacement of Romeo and Juliet. Imagine being able to look up Kipling, read a description of his life, and then read all of his works.\n** This can't be done automatically in any easy way. It's something we're doing by hand. See [[Wikipedia:public domain resources|public domain resources]].\n* Make the category an article belongs to a property of the article. So one can look for all Mathematics articles, etc. This can already be done to some extent: you can always create a category page and add the article to it; but if someone forgets to do this the article will be missed. An automatically generated page could exist for each category, listing what articles belong to it; and also an automatically generated page for articles that do not belong to any category, so they can be assigned to one. '''Also:'''\n* At the top of each topic page, I would like to see a link to the parent topic. [[user:chuckr30|chuckr30]]\n** These aren't just software feature requests, because it's not a programming task to determine what \"category an article belongs to.\" (What does that mean?) Please see [[M:Accidental linking and hard-wired category schemes|this column]]. Re: \"This can already be done to some extent: you can always create a category page and add the article to it; but if someone forgets to do this the article will be missed.\" I reply: So? So the page will be (temporarily) imperfect. Better that than a totally controversial hard-wired category scheme of limited value. The content ''is'' the category scheme. --[[User:LMS|LMS]]\n* I was just thinking about e-mail interface to Wikipedia. What for, you might ask. Sometimes it is for some people hard to get onto the Wikipedia server. I also think it would booster authors' productivity. Off the top of my head I can think of three commands that can be placed in subject line of an e-mail :\n** POST\n** GET - raw text of the page\n** RECEIVE - formatted text of the page\n* of course there should also be 'an article a day' service. POSTing should be reserved to active memebers of this mailing list. There should be some way to safeguarde against accidental overwriting of existing pages. When POSTing raw text in body before '-- ', and author's id from e-mail before '@'.\n* I would like a way for the author of an article to \"lock\" the article. If someone wanted to add something to it, they would email the changes to the author. If the author approves, the author can post the new article. I think you will see tons of poor quality articles here eventually, because some 12-year old thinks it's cool or funny to deface articles. I think it would be wise to be able to lock the articles. [[user:chuckr30|chuckr30]]\n** There is no such thing as \"the author of an article\" on Wikipedia, unless it's just an accident that one person has happened to work on an article so far. So this is not going to happen anytime soon. It is totally anti-wiki, for one thing. Eventually, some such solution might be necessary to make Wikipedia fully scaleable--but I doubt it. Right now it is clearly unnecessary: ''people'' are our protection against vandals. --[[User:LMS|LMS]]\n** I might worry about someone creating a script that would automatically deface pages. As a long term project, consider limiting (throttling) the rate of accepted changes from any one ip address -- [[User:Pat Spinler|Pat Spinler]]\n***I don't like this idea, simply because I would have been throttled myself several times already. Unless we make the limit to something not humanly possible, or at least extremely unlikely--say, 1 or 2 changes each minute for several minutes straight. And actually I've submitted more changes than that on many occasions, especially when adding CIA factbook info but also when adding country codes to the <code>*/Communications</code> pages. Also, I expect [[User:SJK|Simon J Kissane]]'s contributions would have been curbed a few times as well. --[[user:Koyaanis Qatsi|Koyaanis Qatsi]]\n***I don't quite like this idea either, but it made me think of another thing: It would be nice with the possibility to roll back the latest change from the changes page. If someone defaces a page, I can just click something to get the previous version back, instead of having to edit it by hand. --[[User:Pinkunicorn|Pinkunicorn|]]\n***You can do that, with the View other revisions page...you just view the previous revision, click on the Edit this revision link at the bottom, then save it. It saves over later revisions. --[[User:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]\n* The best way is to introduce a voting+visits system (like Google's PageRank) to make sure vox populi automatically kills unwanted changes. Let's say I want to navigate at 90% assurance. Let all poorly voted pages and corrections be invisible. Then I can change the assurance level and see all stuff - including kid's graffiti, [[User:Piotr Wozniak|Piotr Wozniak]]\n** Ick. I can't imagine any better way to ensure total mediocrity. Who cares what the masses think? I want to know what the one or two real experts who cared enough about the subject to slug it out on the /Talk pages finally settled on. --[[user:Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]\n* Ability to have multiple revision branches of an article, ala CVS. That way if there is a difference of opinion on how an article should look, different authors can each work on their own branch without constantly overwriting each others work, and then we can choose which one is better to become the main article, or to integrate them.\n*:It sounds to me as if this would introduce very much complexity for a rather small gain. I think it's better to create Main/MyView and Main/YourView and have a short introduction to the different views on the main page. Even better would be to have both views presented on the main page (perhaps in different sections), but that can always be arranged once they are \"finished\"). --[[User:Pinkunicorn|Pinkunicorn]]\n* Giving to the user some 'pagehits per time' information would make Wikipedia even more dynamic. It's motivating for editors when  they can see that there's a lot of interest in their work. --[[User:Wolfgang Moecklin|Wolfgang Moecklin]]\n* This partially related to that request for email-submission interface above: Open up the interface to the database in order to allow different front-ends. For example, if I'd want to use an interface with support for off-line working I'd have a data base front-end for that. On the other hand, if I'd want a fancy GUI I'd just write a new front-end. This naturally requires that the database interface is stable (and not continuously evolving). So, what I'd basically want is to open up the open project:) --[[User:Tbackstr|Tbackstr]]\n** You might just get that in my [[Wikipedia PHP script]]. I already thought of a TCL/TK program as a frontend to reduce the server load that is coming from page rendering. Of course, you can get an article source automatically even today by scanning the edit page of the article. I am working on something like that to copy wikipedia to MySQL format.--[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]\n* I like [[Everything2]]'s \"soft link\" concept: the server monitors the pages from which visitors reach a given article, and the most common such pages are listed at the bottom of the article, to provide context. --AxelBoldt\n**Though I'm not familar with Everything2, it sounds like a good idea. There should be a way to see what pages link to a particular page easily. - [[User:Eean|Eean]]\n* Rendering of mathematical formulas and chemical diagrams on-the-fly using TeX, similar to [http://www.mathcircle.org/cgi-bin/mathwiki.pl Mathwiki]. The Mathwiki code is written in perl and I hear that it is not in very good shape and probably would have to be reimplemented. --AxelBoldt\n*Have an wiki-code to insert the JavaScript for the \"tool-tips\"-like thing that [[Nupedia]] has. Then have a way to turn them off, like in Nupedia. -- [[User:Eean|Eean]]\n*Add a Java applet that users can specifically request when editing a page that will allow the user to create mathematical equations that the applet will parse in to MathML.\n*Have the \"View other revisions\" link allow access to future revisions as well as past ones. This would allow wikipedians to copy text that hasn't been written yet into the current revision, taking a lot of effort out of editing. Of course, there would have to be safeguards to make sure that no paradoxes resulted; some kind of edit lock that only allows a page to be saved when it matches its next predestined revision, perhaps.\n*:LOL!! That would save all of us a lot of work... let me know when you get the time machine working :) [[user:Karen Johnson|KJ]]\n*Have a global find-and-replace to correct spelling errors and alter ALL links to the one article at the same time rather than having to do them all individually.

Instead of copying and pasting everything on the web, I figured I could just copy the files on the server from one directory to the other. I tried this and the site broke, so now I think I will just ask if there is a way to do this. So: '''When we are changing links to the much nicer free link style, is there a good way to get subsections changed as well without having to manually edit each page in the subsection?'''\n** The wiki admin(s) can use the page-rename commands to move pages.

I'll consider this to be a feature request for renaming all subpages when a page is renamed. --CliffordAdams\n\n==== Automatic links ====\n\n* For every topic, go through and grep every other topic (maybe just the root topic) and automatically create a link to the topic we are looking for. So eventually every word could possibly be a link. This could be great for people interested in the origins of words and would save topic creators much time too.\n** This is a bad idea.

IMO it was better not to use &lt;pre&gt;text&lt;pre&gt; automatically. And I wonder why <a href=\"xxxx\">xxx</a> doesn\u00b4t work, why it can\u00b4t become automatically translated to Wikipedia syntax. Sporadic writers like me may want to use simple things like target=\"_blank\" - things that don\u00b4t spoil consistency nor security - why not implement better filtering? I see you\u00b4re coding Wikipedia in PHP now, so performance should not be a problem. \n<br>Another thing I\u00b4d like to have is modification dates, in an extended view mainly for writers. And tables or div layers to paint colors were cool, maybe even transparent colors (CSS?) to show overlapping and several sucessive changes. [[User:Grasso]]\n\n\nRequests for what goes on outside of the entries--the menubars up top and bottom, etc., user preferences.\n\n* Currently links to entries which do not exist are formatted with a question-mark at the end. This looks unprofessional, similar to old WikiStyle, and distracts from the text. Cascading style sheets offer the possibility to have links in a color other than the ones defined in -body-. It would be nice to display, by default or as an option in the preferences, links to non-existing entries in a different color, e.g. green. If there are problems with the implementation, please add a note here and I'll try to create an HTML example.\n** This should probably be a configurable option, since people using a text browser may not be able to see coloured links -[[user:Bryan Derksen|BD]]\n\n* It should be possible to add a page from the search results page. That is, if I type \"foobar\" in the search, if no page with that exact name exists, the search result page (in addition to showing the matches) should offer me to \"Create an entry about 'foobar' now\". This way, you would still have to check for possible matches, but could add new pages easier. That's the way Everything2 does it, BTW, and it works quite nicely.\n\n* Can we have the \"edit this page right now!\" link back at the top of the page? Or was that voted down? I like it.\n\n** I second the above -- [[User:GWO]]\n\n* I would like a link somewhere to my own personal page, since there I have linked pages that are of interest to me (in lack of a 'subscribe' feature =). I always search for my own page the first thing when I surf to wikipedia.\n\n* I would like to have a CANCEL Button on the Edits page (Page in Edit mode) added to the two existing ones SUBMIT and PREVIEW. Just to have a clear understanding what is going on and what the system/database is up to. [[User:StefanRybo]]\n\n** How about a \"SPELL CHECK\" button, too?\n\n*** It would be helpful if the spell checking also check for variations of Wiki links, such as \"Recent Changes\" vs. \"[[Recent Changes]]\". It can eliminate branching of similar pages.\n\n* Automatically update the present (server) date. Link the date to that day's page.\n\n\n\n* When I'm editing a topic, I'd like to have the search box available at the bottom of the page. [[User:Janet Davis]]\n\n** Suggestion: have the search results appear in a new window, so you don't lose whatever it was you're working on. -- [[User:Gimbo]]\n\n\n\n* Making the \"redirected from\" comment at the top of each page an option which is by default off, not on. This feature would clean up wikipedia pages for casual users, and leave the nuts and bolts visible to people who wish to track down the offending \n:''See also :'' [[Feature requests]]<nowiki>OdDlyCapitaliZed</nowiki> links, etc. Of course (if I may say so) ;-) for this option to work, the caching problem would first have to be resolved. --KQ\n\n\n\n** Under this scheme, how could we ever visit the redirection page? By switching a preference? I dunno, seems like we have to edit redirection pages too often. This would just create confusion, wouldn't it? --[[User:LMS]]\n\n** Yes, I think you're right. Maybe if we could just exclude them from \"Random Page\" results\n\n\n\n* Provide a user preference to include the ''preview'' (formatted version of the page) when entering editing mode. (This would save me one click + wait for almost every page I edit. [[User:Buttonius]]\n\n\n* A way to do doublecolumns and/or sidebars (so we can have a list 'o links to the right of the text)\n\n\n\n**Double columns are only natively supported by Netscape. However they could be done by using tables. [[user:chuckr30|chuckr30]]\n\n\n\n** Maybe, if such sidebars could be created ''automatically'' and for ''all'' articles. But what's wrong with having the links at the bottom of the page? If that's reasonably acceptable, why go through the confusion of having links in a sidebar? --[[User:LMS]]\n\n\n\n* A link to [[How does one edit a page/Quick reference]] from the editing page, to avoid me having to dive through the [[FAQ]] every time I can't remember a special character -- DrBob \n\n** Seconded. Though in fact the quick reference is now on the main [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|How does one edit a page]]. -- Tarquin\n\n\n* The SEARCH field and button should be located at the top of the page, just like with search engines, because it feels more intuitive that way. At least the main page should have the SEARCH code in the upper part of the page. -- Kahuna \"Pierre\" Shanx\n\n**Absolutely! The first thing I want to do if i go to Wikipedia is looking for some word. The way it is now, I always have to scroll down (yeah, my window is small...)\n\n\n\n*** Maybe make its placement a user preference: top, bottom, or both? -- [[User:Gimbo]]\n\n\n****I think both would be best: for example, take a look at the page generated by a succesful Google search, such as http://www.google.com/search?q=wikipedia\n\n* How about a link at the bottom of each page that would automatically create a bibliography reference (works cited) for a paper?  This would probably encourage students to use wikipedia more as a serious reference.\n\n* A drop down box that allows quick and dirty machine translation into other languages on each article of each language's wikipedia.\n\n* Could we have a user interface so that it looks like we're on a corporate webpage, so we could read Wikipedia at work without being conspicuous?\n\n:''See also :'' [[Wikipedia:Phase II feature requests]]", "sha1": "3dsx9jux72rp5szj397z7ptkq5xaa4f"}}, {"title": "February 26", "ns": "0", "id": "11141", "revision": {"id": "866272418", "parentid": "866255506", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T10:36:57Z", "contributor": {"username": "Lectonar", "id": "128863"}, "comment": "Reverted 1 pending edit by [[Special:Contributions/103.216.83.114|103.216.83.114]] to revision 862420524 by Lectonar: only for people", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{calendar}}\n{{This date in recent years}}\n{{Day}}\n\n==Events==\n*[[740s BCE|747 BC]] &ndash; [[Epoch (reference date)|Epoch]] (origin) of [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Nabonassar]] Era.\n* [[364]] &ndash; [[Valentinian I]] is proclaimed [[Roman emperor]].\n*[[1233]] &ndash; [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|Mongol\u2013Jin War]]: The [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|capture Kaifeng]], the capital of the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]], after besieging it for months.\n*[[1266]] &ndash; [[Battle of Benevento]]: An army led by [[Charles I of Naples|Charles, Count of Anjou]], defeats a combined German and [[Sicily|Sicilian]] force led by [[Manfred, King of Sicily]].

Being smaller and simpler than contemporaries such as the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]], the F-5 cost less to both procure and operate, making it a popular export aircraft. The F-5 started life as a privately funded light fighter program by Northrop in the 1950s. The design team wrapped a small, highly aerodynamic fighter around two compact and high-thrust [[General Electric J85]] engines, focusing on performance and low cost of maintenance. Though primarily designed for the day air superiority role, the aircraft is also a capable ground-attack platform. The F-5A entered service in the early 1960s. During the [[Cold War]], over 800 were produced through 1972 for U.S. allies. Though the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) had no acknowledged need for a light fighter, it did procure approximately 1,200 [[Northrop T-38 Talon]] trainer aircraft, which were directly based on the F-5A.\n\nAfter winning the International Fighter Aircraft competition in 1970, a program aimed at providing effective low-cost fighters to American allies, Northrop introduced the second-generation F-5E Tiger II in 1972. This upgrade included more powerful engines, higher fuel capacity, greater wing area and improved leading edge extensions for a better turn rate, optional air-to-air refueling, and improved avionics including air-to-air radar. Primarily used by American allies, it remains in US service to support training exercises. It has served in a wide array of roles, being able to perform both air and ground attack duties; the type was used extensively in the Vietnam War.<ref name=\"joebaugher.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f5_40.html|title=Northrop F-5E/F Tiger II in Service with Vietnam|publisher=}}</ref> A total of 1,400 Tiger IIs were built before production ended in 1987.

The F-5 also served as a starting point for a series of design studies which resulted in the [[Northrop YF-17]] and the [[F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]] navalized fighter aircraft. The [[Northrop F-20 Tigershark]] was an advanced variant to succeed the F-5E which was ultimately canceled when export customers did not emerge.\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Origins===\nThe design effort was led by Northrop vice president of engineering and aircraft designer [[Edgar Schmued]],<ref>Garrison, Peter. \"White Rocket\", Air and Space Magazine, September 2005.</ref> who previously at [[North American Aviation]] had been the chief designer of the successful [[North American P-51 Mustang]] and [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] fighters. Schmued recruited a strong engineering team to Northrop<ref>Wagner 2000, p. 195. Chapter 9 of this book is devoted to the F-5.</ref> and assigned them the goal of reversing the trend in fighter development towards greater size and weight in order to deliver an aircraft with high performance, enhanced maneuverability, and high reliability, while still delivering a cost advantage over contemporary fighters.<ref>Stuart, William G., \"Northrop F-5 Case Study in Aircraft Design\", 1978, pp. 5\u20137. Reprints are available from on-line sources.</ref> Recognizing that expensive jet aircraft could not viably be replaced every few years, he also demanded \"engineered growth potential\" allowing service longevity in excess of 10 years.<ref>Wagner 2000, p. 197.</ref>  Schmued recognized that new jet engine and aerodynamic technology were crucial to these goals, such as the compact but high thrust-to-weight ratio [[General Electric J85]] turbojet engine, and the recently discovered transonic [[area rule]] to reduce drag.  The J85 engine had been developed to power McDonnell's [[ADM-20 Quail]] decoy employed upon the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]].<ref name=\"Claws p111-4\">Braybrook 1982, pp. 111\u2013114.</ref> This engine with thrust-to-weight ratios of 6.25 to 7.5 over various versions had a notable thrust per pound advantage over contemporaries, such as the 4.7 thrust-to-weight ratio of the [[J79]] engine used in the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom]].<ref>Stuart 1978, p. 21.</ref>\n\n[[File:Northrop YF-5A.jpg|thumb|The first Northrop YF-5A prototype]]\nAnother highly influential figure was chief engineer Welko Gasich,<ref>Garrison, 2005.</ref> who convinced Schmued that the engines must be located within the fuselage for maximum performance. Gasich also for the first time introduced the concept of \"life cycle cost\" into fighter design, which provided the foundation for the F-5's low operating cost and long service life. The low costs involved has been recognized as an important element of the aircraft's effectiveness;<ref>Sprey 1982, p. 63.</ref>{{refn|Of aircraft effectiveness, Sprey generally commented that: \"The second most important effectiveness area, after ability to surprise, is the ability to outnumber the enemy. This dimension of effectiveness is also an inherent characteristic of the design of a fighter, since the design determines the procurement cost, the operating cost and the sorties per day.\"<ref>Sprey, 1982, p. 63</ref>|group=N}} defense analyst and combat aircraft architect [[Pierre Sprey]] stated in a 1982 U.S. Department of Defense report that, \"Increases in cost and complexity that were unnecessary to enhance air-to-air effectiveness have decreased today's effective force size per constant dollar by factors of 25 to 75, relative to the F-86's 2000 sorties/day per billion dollars.<ref name=Sprey_p64>Sprey 1982, p. 64.</ref>{{refn|Sprey's relative figure of merit on cost is defined as available combat sorties/day per billion dollars invested in procurement, training, and maintenance over a 10 year peace time period.  It is accurate so long as the period of conflict is short relative to 10 years.<ref name=Sprey_p64/>|group=N}} The only exception to this strikingly adverse trend is the F-5E, which manages to produce 500 sorties/day per billion dollars.\"<ref>Sprey 1982, p. 130.</ref> The total cost of an F-5 sortie is approximately 20% that of an F-16 sortie,<ref name=\"Sprey, p. 145\">Sprey 1982, p. 145.</ref> even though the F-16 is a cost effective modern fighter.  This low cost was also a very deliberate strategy of Northrop in following a focused [[light fighter]] plan.  A Northrop design study stated \"The application of advanced technology was used to provide maximum force effectiveness at minimum cost.  This became the Northrop philosophy in the development of the T-38 and F-5 lightweight trainer and fighter aircraft.\"<ref>Stuart, 1978, p. 7.</ref>\n\nThe flying qualities of the F-5 are often highly rated, comparable to the [[North American F-86 Sabre]] and the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]].<ref>Sprey 1982, p. 109.</ref>  The safe and predictable flying qualities of the F-5, while still maintaining high agility, was a deliberate goal of the design team. The company stated \"Northrop took a new approach that the initial design layout shall stress excellent flying qualities such that utilization of the complete performance envelope is available to the pilot.\"<ref>Stuart, 1978, p. 16.</ref>\n\nAccording to defense analyst and prominent Pentagon [[fighter mafia]] (of F-16 fame) member Pierre Sprey, the F-5 was perhaps the most effective U.S. air-to-air fighter in the 1960s and early 1970s based on his published fighter effectiveness criteria.<ref>Sprey 1982, pp. 143\u2013145.</ref><ref>Sprey 1982, pp. 97, 145.</ref> Sprey defines the key factors of fighter effectiveness in order of importance as 1. Ability to surprise the enemy without being surprised, 2. On a per budget basis, ability to outnumber the enemy via lower unit cost and higher sortie rates and reliability, 3.  Ability to outmaneuver the enemy, and 4.

The company designation for the first design as the N-156, intended partly to meet a U.S. Navy requirement for a jet fighter to operate from its [[escort carrier]]s, which were too small to operate the Navy's existing jet fighters. That requirement disappeared when the Navy decided to withdraw the escort carriers; however Northrop continued development of the N-156, both as a two-seat advanced trainer, designated as N-156T, and a single-seat fighter, designated as N-156F.<ref>Paloque 2013, pp. 4\u20137.</ref>\n\nThe N-156T was quickly selected by the [[United States Air Force]] as a replacement for the [[Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star|T-33]] in July 1956. On 12 June 1959, the first prototype aircraft, which was subsequently designated as [[Northrop T-38 Talon|YT-38 Talon]], performed its first flight. By the time production had ended in January 1972, a total of 1,158 Talons were produced.<ref name=\"WAPJ 25 p50-1\">Lake and Hewson 1996, pp. 50\u201351.</ref><ref name=\"Claws p114\">Braybrook 1982, p. 114.</ref> Development of the N-156F continued at a lower priority as a private venture by Northrop; on 25 February 1958, an order for three prototypes was issued for a prospective low-cost fighter that could be supplied under the [[Military Assistance Program]] for distribution to less-developed nations. The first N-156F flew at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] on 30 July 1959, exceeding the [[Supersonic#Supersonic flight|speed of sound]] on its first flight.<ref name=\"WAPJ 25 p51\">Lake and Hewson 1996, p. 51.</ref>\n\nAlthough testing of the N-156F was successful, demonstrating unprecedented reliability and proving superior in the ground-attack role to the USAF's existing [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]]s, official interest in the Northrop type waned, and by 1960 it looked as if the program was a failure. Interest revived in 1961 when the [[United States Army]] tested it, (along with the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] and [[Fiat G.91]]) for reconnaissance and close-support. Although all three types proved capable during Army testing, operating fixed-wing combat aircraft was legally the responsibility of the Air Force, which would not agree to operate the N-156 or allow the Army to operate fixed-wing combat aircraft, a situation repeated with the [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|C-7 Caribou]].<ref name=\"Harding army\">Harding 1990, pp. 118\u2013119, 122\u2013123, 188\u2013189.</ref>\n\n[[File:F-5C VNAF 23TW 522FS BienHoa 1971.jpg|thumb|left|[[Republic of Vietnam Air Force|VNAF]] F-5C [[Bien Hoa Air Base]], 1971]]\nIn 1962, however, the [[Kennedy Administration]] revived the requirement for a low-cost export fighter, selecting the N-156F as winner of the F-X competition on 23 April 1962 subsequently becoming the \"F-5A\", being ordered into production in October that year.<ref name=\"WAPJ 25 p52-3\">Lake and Hewson 1996, pp. 52\u201353.</ref> It was named under the [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system]], which included a re-set of the fighter number series.

It had more powerful (5,000&nbsp;lbf) [[General Electric J85]]-21 engines, and had a lengthened and enlarged fuselage, accommodating more fuel. Its wings were fitted with enlarged [[leading edge extension]]s, giving an increased wing area and improved maneuverability. The aircraft's [[avionics]] were more sophisticated, crucially including a [[radar]] (initially the [[Emerson Electric]] [[AN/APQ-153]]) (the F-5A and B had no radar).

Similar radar upgrades were also proposed for F-5F, with the derivative of AN/APQ-159, the AN/APQ-167, to replace the AN/APQ-157, but that was cancelled. The latest radar upgrade included the Emerson [[AN/APG-69]], which was the successor of AN/APQ-159, incorporating mapping capability. However, most nations chose not to upgrade for financial reasons, and the radar saw very little service in USAF aggressor squadrons and Swiss air force.<ref>{{cite web|title=F-5 Tiger II|url=http://www.touchdown-aviation.com/types/swiss-air-force/f-5-tiger-ii.php|website=Touchdown Aviation|accessdate=29 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nVarious F-5 versions remain in service with many nations.

In 1971, 54 Canadian-built CF-5As were put in storage, after the RCAF could not take them due to budget cuts. From this batch, Venezuela acquired 16 CF-5As and two CF-5Ds. In 1972, after all the aircraft were delivered, the F-86s, Venoms, and Vampires were finally scrapped.\n\nThe F-5 became the first military plane in Venezuela capable of flying at supersonic speeds. After a legal dispute between Canadair and Northrop, two more CF-5Ds were built and delivered to Venezuela in 1974. Their first base of operations was the General Rafael Urdaneta Air Base in [[Maracaibo]]. After 1974, the fleet was relocated to Teniente Vicente Landaeta Gil Air Base in [[Barquisimeto]].\n\nIn 1979, after several upgrades to the fleet's communication, navigation and approximation equipment, the aircraft were renamed VF-5s, designating the CF-5As as VF-5As and the CF-5Ds as VF-5Ds. Venezuelan F-5s could also carry weaponry such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, Mk.82 and M117 bombs, and 70mm rocket launchers.\n\nIn 1991, after tensions between Colombia and Venezuela almost led to a conflict, the air force started yet another modernization program for the F-5s, called \"Proyecto Grifo\" (Project Gryphon).  Some aircraft (VF-5D number 5681 and VF-5A number 9124) were sent to Singapore for testing, then brought back for upgrade of the remaining airframes. That same year, a small fleet of four NF-5Bs and a single NF-5A, was acquired from the Netherlands to replace aircraft lost in previous years.\n\nIn 1992, [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempts|during the coup d'\u00e9tat attempt against president Carlos Andres Perez]], 3 F-5s were lost to a rebel-operated [[OV-10 Bronco]] bombing Barquisimeto Air Base.

The fleet was equipped with inertial laser navigation systems (similar to those in Venezuelan F-16s), IFFs, HUDs, refueling probes and modernized engines with an estimated lifespan of 22 years.\n\nIn 2002, small upgrades were made to the remaining F-5s. The fleet was kept operational until 2010, when a batch of [[Hongdu JL-8]]s was delivered as their replacement. By late 2010, it was known that at least one VF-5D was in flight-worthy condition; it is unknown if more aircraft are in operational condition.\n\nBetween 1972 and 2002, a total of 9 Venezuelan F-5s were lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fav-club.com/2015/12/19/el-caza-bombardero-ligero-vf-5-en-la-fuerza-aerea-venezolana/|title=El caza bombardero ligero VF-5 en la Fuerza A\u00e9rea Venezolana \u2013 FAV-Club|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Others===\nSaudi Arabia deployed F-5Es during the [[Gulf War]], flying close air support and aerial interdiction missions against Iraqi units in [[Kuwait]].

Compared to the F-5E, it had 60% more power, a higher climb rate and acceleration, better cockpit visibility, more modern radar and BVR capability, and competitive performance with fourth generation fighters. Like the F-5, it had better cost effectiveness as it had the minimum necessary features relative to its competition to perform its air superiority mission. As an example, in the 1960s and early 1970s, the F-5's lack of BVR missiles was not a significant disadvantage as the kill rate of such missiles was approximately 8% to 10%,<ref>Sprey 1982, p. 118.</ref> and the performance and loss of surprise (radar warning to the enemy) cost of carrying them was not practically justified. By the early 1980s, the American [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] radar-guided missile in its \"M\" version was realistically exceeding a 60% kill rate, and was integrated onto the F-20. Brigadier General [[Chuck Yeager]], test pilot and the first man to break the sound barrier, referred to the F-20 as \"the finest fighter\".<ref>Yeager and Janos 1985, pp. 248\u2013249.</ref> Despite its performance and cost effectiveness, the F-20 lost out for foreign sales against the similarly capable, more expensive F-16, which was being procured in large numbers by the U.S. Air Force and was viewed as having greater support.<ref>Hammond 2001, p. 99.</ref>\n\n====Northrop YF-17====\n{{main|Northrop YF-17}}\n\nThe Northrop YF-17's aircraft's main design elements date from the F-5 based internal Northrop project N-300. The N-300 featured a longer fuselage, small leading-edge root extensions (LERX), and more powerful GE15-J1A1 turbojets. The wing was moved higher on the fuselage to increase ordnance flexibility. The N-300 further evolved into the P-530 Cobra. The P-530's wing planform and nose section was similar to the F-5, with a trapezoidal shape formed by a sweep of 20\u00b0 at the quarter-chord line, and an unswept trailing edge, but was over double the area. While the YF-17 lost its bid for the USAF lightweight fighter, it would be developed into the larger [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]].\n\n====Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration====\n{{main|Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration}}\n\nA single ex-USN F-5E was modified to carry out research into reducing noise from supersonic flight by shaping the shock waves produced by the aircraft.\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:F-5 freedom fighter.PNG|thumb|400px|Northrop F-5 operators (former operators in red)]]\n[[File:Chile Air Force Northrop F-5E Tigre III Lofting-1.jpg|thumb|Chile Air Force Northrop F-5E Tiger III]]\n[[File:Jordanian F-5 Tiger II aircraft (1987).JPEG|thumb|Jordanian F-5 Tiger II aircraft (1987)]]\n[[File:F-5 Tiger Kenya.jpg|thumb|[[Kenya Air Force]] F-5E Tiger II and an USAF [[C-5 Galaxy]] in the background]]\n[[File:Moroccan F-5 jet.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Moroccan Air Force]] F-5E Tiger III during an aerial refueling mission in African Lion 2009]]\n[[File:Saudi Tiger.JPEG|thumb|F-5F of Royal Saudi Air Force taking off]]\n[[File:Mark and vic f-5 pic (2).jpg|thumb|Mark Daniels and Victor Miller F-5 aircraft]]\n[[File:VillamorMuseumjf0803 26.JPG|thumb|Philippine Air Force F-5]]\n[[File:RSAF F-5 preparing to take off.jpg|thumb|An F-5S belonging to the Singaporean air force's [[144 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|144 Squadron]] prepares for takeoff]]\n[[File:Patrouille Suisse Northrop F-5E Tiger II (J-3082) arrives RIAT Fairford 10thJuly2014 arp.jpg|thumb|F-5E Tiger II of the Swiss [[Patrouille Suisse]] aerobatics team arrives for the 2014 [[Royal International Air Tattoo]], [[Fairford]], [[England]].

[[Water]] is used as the vehicle for the dry-powder pigment to merge with the plaster, and with the setting of the plaster, the painting becomes an integral part of the wall. The word fresco ({{lang-it|affresco}}) is derived from the Italian adjective ''fresco'' meaning \"fresh\", and may thus be contrasted with [[fresco-secco|fresco-secco or secco]] mural painting techniques, which are applied to dried plaster, to supplement painting in fresco. The fresco technique has been employed since antiquity and is closely associated with [[Italian Renaissance painting]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Conservation of Wall Paintings |author1=Mora, Paolo |author2=Mora, Laura |author3=Philippot, Paul |publisher=[[Butterworth\u2013Heinemann|Butterworths]] |year=1984 |isbn=0-408-10812-6 |pages=34\u201354}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The GroveEncyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art |editor=Ward, Gerald W.

Because of the chemical makeup of the plaster, a [[binder (material)|binder]] is not required, as the pigment mixed solely with the water will sink into the intonaco, which itself becomes the medium holding the pigment. The pigment is absorbed by the wet plaster; after a number of hours, the plaster dries in reaction to air: it is this chemical reaction which fixes the pigment particles in the plaster.\nThe chemical processes are as follows:<ref>{{cite book |title=Conservation of Wall Paintings |author1=Mora, Paolo |author2=Mora, Laura |author3=Philippot, Paul |publisher=[[Butterworth\u2013Heinemann|Butterworths]] |year=1984 |isbn=0-408-10812-6 |pages=47\u201354}}</ref>\n* [[calcination]] of [[limestone]] in a [[lime kiln]]: [[Calcium Carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]] \u2192 [[Calcium oxide|CaO]] + [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]\n* [[Slaking (geology)|slaking]] of [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]]: [[Calcium oxide|CaO]] + [[Water|H<sub>2</sub>O]] \u2192 [[Calcium hydroxide|Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>]]\n* [[Calcium hydroxide#Properties|setting]] of the [[lime plaster]]: [[Calcium hydroxide|Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>]] + [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] \u2192 [[Calcium Carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]] + [[Water|H<sub>2</sub>O]]\n\n[[File:Giovane-seduto.JPG|thumb|A [[Roman art|Roman fresco]] of a young man from the Villa di Arianna, [[Stabiae]], 1st century AD.]]\nIn painting ''buon fresco'', a rough underlayer called the ''arriccio'' is added to the whole area to be painted and allowed to dry for some days. Many artists sketched their compositions on this underlayer, which would never be seen, in a red pigment called [[sinopia]], a name also used to refer to these under-paintings.  Later,{{when|date=December 2010}}new techniques for transferring paper drawings to the wall were developed.  The main lines of a drawing made on paper were pricked over with a point, the paper held against the wall, and a bag of soot (''spolvero'') banged on them on produce black dots along the lines. If the painting was to be done over an existing fresco, the surface would be roughened to provide better adhesion.  On the day of painting, the intonaco, a thinner, smooth layer of fine plaster was added to the amount of wall that was expected to be completed that day, sometimes matching the contours of the figures or the landscape, but more often just starting from the top of the composition.  This area is called the ''giornata'' (\"day's work\"), and the different day stages can usually be seen in a large fresco, by a sort of seam that separates one from the next.\n\n''Buon frescoes'' are difficult to create because of the deadline associated with the drying plaster.  Generally, a layer of plaster will require ten to twelve hours to dry; ideally, an artist would begin to paint after one hour and continue until two hours before the drying time\u2014giving seven to nine hours' working time.  Once a ''giornata'' is dried, no more ''buon fresco'' can be done, and the unpainted intonaco must be removed with a tool before starting again the next day.  If mistakes have been made, it may also be necessary to remove the whole intonaco for that area\u2014or to change them later, ''a secco''.\nAn indispensable component of this process is the [[carbonatation]] of the lime, which fixes the colour in the plaster ensuring durability of the fresco for future generations.<ref>[http://www.italian-frescos.com/come-nasce-un-affresco-strappato-da-muro/?lang=en How is a fresco made? - Fresco Blog] by Italian Fresco Blog.</ref>\n\nA technique used in the popular frescoes of Michelangelo and Raphael was to scrape indentations into certain areas of the plaster while still wet to increase the illusion of depth and to accent certain areas over others. The eyes of the people of the [[School of Athens]] are sunken-in using this technique which causes the eyes to seem deeper and more pensive. Michelangelo used this technique as part of his trademark 'outlining' of his central figures within his frescoes.\n\nIn a wall-sized fresco, there may be ten to twenty or even more ''giornate'', or separate areas of plaster.  After five centuries, the ''giornate'', which were originally nearly invisible, have sometimes become visible, and in many large-scale frescoes, these divisions may be seen from the ground.  Additionally, the border between giornate was often covered by an ''a secco'' painting, which has since fallen off.\n\nOne of the first painters in the post-classical period to use this technique was the Isaac Master (or Master of the Isaac fresco, and thus a name used to refer to the unknown master of a particular painting) in the Upper [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis]] in [[Assisi]]. A person who creates fresco is called a frescoist.\n\n==Other types of wall painting==\n[[File:Pompeii - Casa dei Casti Amanti - Banquet.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|An [[ancient Roman]] fresco with a banquet scene from the Casa dei Casti Amanti, [[Pompeii]]]]\nA [[fresco-secco|secco or fresco-secco]] painting is done on dry plaster (''secco'' meaning \"dry\" in Italian).  The pigments thus require a binding medium, such as [[egg (food)|egg]] ([[tempera]]), glue or [[oil painting|oil]] to attach the pigment to the wall.  It is important to distinguish between ''a secco'' work done '''on top''' of ''buon fresco'', which according to most authorities was in fact standard from the Middle Ages onwards, and work done entirely ''a secco'' on a blank wall.  Generally, ''buon fresco'' works are more durable than any ''a secco'' work added on top of them, because ''a secco'' work lasts better with a roughened plaster surface, whilst true fresco should have a smooth one.  The additional ''a secco'' work would be done to make changes, and sometimes to add small details, but also because not all colours can be achieved in true fresco, because only some pigments work chemically in the very [[alkaline]] environment of fresh lime-based plaster.  Blue was a particular problem, and skies and blue robes were often added ''a secco'', because neither [[azurite]] blue nor [[lapis lazuli]], the only two blue pigments then available, works well in wet fresco.<ref>All this section - Ugo Procacci, in ''Frescoes from Florence'', pp. 15-25 1969, Arts Council, London.</ref>\n\nIt has also become increasingly clear, thanks to modern analytical techniques, that even in the early Italian Renaissance painters quite frequently employed ''a secco'' techniques so as to allow the use of a broader range of pigments.  In most early examples this work has now entirely vanished, but a whole painting done ''a secco'' on a surface roughened to give a key for the paint may survive very well, although damp is more threatening to it than to ''buon fresco''.\n\nA third type called a ''mezzo-fresco'' is painted on nearly dry intonaco\u2014firm enough not to take a thumb-print, says the sixteenth-century author Ignazio Pozzo\u2014so that the pigment only penetrates slightly into the plaster. By the end of the sixteenth century this had largely displaced ''buon fresco'', and was used by painters such as [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]] or [[Michelangelo]].  This technique had, in reduced form, the advantages of ''a secco'' work.\n\nThe three key advantages of work done entirely ''a secco'' were that it was quicker, mistakes could be corrected, and the colours varied less from when applied to when fully dry\u2014in wet fresco there was a considerable change.\n\nFor wholly ''a secco'' work, the intonaco is laid with a rougher finish, allowed to dry completely and then usually given a key by rubbing with sand. The painter then proceeds much as he would on a canvas or wood panel.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Investiture_of_Zimri-Lim_Louvre_AO19826_n01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''[[Investiture of Zimri-Lim]]'', Syria, fresco painted c. 1770 BCE]][[File:Fresco of a fisherman, Akrotiri, Greece.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''The Fisherman'', [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Bronze Age]] fresco from [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]], on the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] island of [[Santorini]] (classically Thera), dated to the Neo-Palatial period (c. 1640\u20131600 BC). The settlement of Akrotiri was buried in volcanic ash (dated by [[radiocarbon dating]] to c. 1627 BC) by the [[Minoan eruption]] on the island, which preserved many Minoan frescoes like this]]\n[[File:Velia Velcha Orcus II.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] fresco of Velia Velcha from the [[Tomb of Orcus]], [[Tarquinia]]]]\n\n=== Egypt and Ancient Near East ===\n\nAn old fresco is the ''[[Investiture of Zimri-Lim]]'' from [[Syria]], dating from the early 18th century BC. In contrast, Ancient Egyptians painted many tombs and houses, but those wall paintings are not frescoes.<ref>Nina M. Davies: ''Ancient Egyptian paintings, Vol. III'', Chicago, 1963, p. xxxi [https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/paintings3.pdf?gathStatIcon=true online]</ref>\n\n=== Aegean civilizations ===\n\nThe oldest frescoes done in the Buon Fresco method date from the first half of the second millennium BCE during the [[Bronze Age]] and are to be found among [[Aegean civilizations]], more precisely the [[Minoan culture]] from the island of [[Crete]] and other islands of the [[Aegean Sea]]. The most famous of these, The Toreador, depicts a sacred ceremony in which individuals jump over the backs of large bulls. The oldest surviving Minoan frescoes are found on the island of [[Santorini]] (classically known as Thera), dated to the Neo-Palatial period (c. 1640\u20131600 BC).\n\nWhile some similar frescoes have been found in other locations around the Mediterranean basin, particularly in Egypt and Morocco, their origins are subject to speculation. Some art historians believe that fresco artists from Crete may have been sent to various locations as part of a trade exchange, a possibility which raises to the fore the importance of this art form within the society of the times. The most common form of ''fresco'' was [[Egypt]]ian wall paintings in [[tomb]]s, usually using the ''a secco'' technique.\n\n===Classical antiquity===\n[[File:Herkulaneischer Meister 002.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Fresco of \"[[Sappho]]\" from [[Pompeii]], c. 50 CE]]\n\nFrescoes were also painted in [[ancient Greece]], but few of these works have survived. In southern Italy, at [[Paestum]], which was a [[Greek colony]] of the [[Magna Graecia]], a tomb containing frescoes dating back to 470 BC, the so-called [[Tomb of the Diver]] was discovered in June 1968. These frescoes depict scenes of the life and society of ancient Greece, and constitute valuable historical testimonials. One shows a group of men reclining at a [[symposium]] while another shows a young man [[diving]] into the sea. [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] frescoes, dating from the 4th century BCE, have been found in the [[Tomb of Orcus]] near [[Veii]], Italy.\n\n[[Roman Empire|Roman]] wall paintings, such as those at the magnificent Villa dei Misteri (1st century B.C.) in the ruins of [[Pompeii]], and others at [[Herculaneum]], were completed in ''buon fresco.''\n\nLate Roman Empire (Christian) 1st-2nd-century frescoes were found in catacombs beneath Rome, and Byzantine Icons were also found in [[Cyprus]], [[Crete]], [[Ephesus]], [[Cappadocia]], and [[Antioch]]. Roman frescoes were done by the artist painting the artwork on the still damp plaster of the wall, so that the painting is part of the wall, actually colored plaster.\n\nAlso a historical collection of Ancient Christian frescoes can be found in the [[Churches of Goreme Turkey]].\n\n===India===\n[[File:Indischer Maler des 6. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|Fresco from the [[Ajanta caves]] built and painted during the [[Gupta Empire]] in the 6th century AD]]\n\nThanks to large number of ancient rock-cut cave temples, valuable ancient and early medieval frescoes have been preserved in more than 20 locations of India.<ref>[http://www.wondermondo.com/Best/As/IndMedCavePaint.htm Ancient and medieval Indian cave paintings - Internet encyclopedia] by Wondermondo. Retrieved 4 June 2010.</ref>\nThe frescoes on the ceilings and walls of the [[Ajanta Caves]] were painted between c. 200 BC and 600 and are the oldest known frescoes in India. They depict the [[Jataka]] tales that are stories of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s life in former existences as [[Bodhisattva]]. The narrative episodes are depicted one after another although not in a linear order. Their identification has been a core area of research on the subject since the time of the site's rediscovery in 1819. Other locations with valuable preserved ancient and early medieval frescoes include [[Bagh Caves]], [[Ellora Caves]], [[Sittanavasal]], [[Armamalai Cave]], [[Badami Cave Temples]] and other locations. Frescoes have been made in several techniques, including tempera technique.\n\nThe later [[Chola]] paintings were discovered in 1931 within the circumambulatory passage of the [[Brihadisvara Temple]] in India and are the first Chola specimens discovered.\n\nResearchers have discovered the technique used in these frescos. A smooth batter of limestone mixture was applied over the stones, which took two to three days to set. Within that short span, such large paintings were painted with natural organic pigments.\n\nDuring the [[Thanjavur Nayak|Nayak]] period, the Chola paintings were painted over. The Chola frescos lying underneath have an ardent spirit of [[saivism]] expressed in them. They probably synchronised with the completion of the temple by [[Rajaraja Cholan]] the Great.\n\nThe frescoes in [[Dogra]]/ Pahari style paintings exist in their unique form at [[Sheesh Mahal, Ramnagar|Sheesh Mahal]] of Ramnagar (105&nbsp;km from [[Jammu]] and 35&nbsp;km west of Udhampur). Scenes from epics of [[Mahabharat]] and [[Ramayan]] along with portraits of local lords form the subject matter of these wall paintings. [[Rang Mahal (Chamba)|Rang Mahal]] of Chamba ([[Himachal Pradesh]]) is another site of historic [[Dogri]] fresco with wall paintings depicting scenes of ''Draupti Cheer Haran'', and ''Radha- Krishna Leela''. This can be seen preserved at National Museum at New Delhi in a chamber called ''Chamba Rang Mahal''.\n\n===Sri Lanka===\n[[File:Sigiriya ladies.jpg|thumb|right|Sigiriya Fresco, Sri Lanka. c. 477 \u2013 495 AD]] \n[[File:Church of Deir Mar Musa 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Frescos in the [[Monastery of Saint Moses the Abyssinian]], [[Syria]]]]\nThe Sigiriya Frescoes are found in [[Sigiriya]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. Painted during the reign of [[Kashyapa I of Anuradhapura|King Kashyapa I]] (ruled 477 \u2014 495 AD). The generally accepted view is that they are portrayals of women of the royal court of the king depicted as celestial nymphs showering flowers upon the humans below. They bear some resemblance to the Gupta style of painting found in the [[Ajanta Caves]] in [[India]]. They are, however, far more enlivened and colorful and uniquely Sri Lankan in character. They are the only surviving secular art from antiquity found in Sri Lanka today.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ponnamperuma|first=Senani|title=Sigiriya Frescoes|url=http://seelanka.net/sigiriya/sigiriya-frescoes.html}}</ref>\n\nThe painting technique used on the Sigiriya paintings is \"fresco lustro.\" It varies slightly from the pure fresco technique in that it also contains a mild binding agent or glue. This gives the painting added durability, as clearly demonstrated by the fact that they have survived, exposed to the elements, for over 1,500 years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ponnamperuma|first=Senani|title=Story of Sigiriya|date=2013|publisher=Panique Pty Ltd|location=Melbourne|isbn=9780987345110}}</ref>\n\nLocated in a small sheltered depression a hundred meters above ground only 19 survive today.

The city is built on a lagoon in northern Italy. The humidity and the rise of water over the centuries have created a phenomenon known as rising damp. As the lagoon water rises and seeps into the foundation of a building, the water is absorbed and rises up through the walls often causing damage to frescoes. Venetians have become quite adept in the conservation methods of frescoes. The mold [[aspergillus versicolor]] can grow after flooding, to consume nutrients from frescoes.<ref name= Bennettjw>{{cite book |author= Bennett JW|year=2010|chapter=An Overview of the Genus ''Aspergillus''|chapter-url=http://www.open-access-biology.com/aspergillus/aspergillusch1.pdf|title=''Aspergillus'': Molecular Biology and Genomics|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-53-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Orio Ciferri|title=Microbial Degradation of Paintings|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=March 1999|volume=65|pages=879\u2013885|pmc=91117|pmid=10049836|issue=3}}</ref>\n\nThe following is the process that was used when rescuing frescoes in [[La Fenice]], a Venetian opera house, but the same process can be used for similarly damaged frescoes. First, a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and polyvinyl alcohol is applied. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuuming. The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with deionized water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with base exchange resin compresses and the wall and pictorial layer were strengthened with barium hydrate. The cracks and detachments are stopped with lime putty and injected with an epoxy resin loaded with micronized silica.<ref>Ciacci, Leonardo., ed, La Fenice Reconstructed 1996&ndash;2003: a building site in the city,\n(Venezia: Marsilio, 2003),118.</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n\n{{clear}}\n<gallery mode=packed-hover heights=154px caption=\"''Frescos''\">\nFile:chola fresco.png|Chola Fresco of Dancing girls.

This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, which only slowly recovers as nitrogen is \"[[Nitrogen fixation|fixed]]\" from the atmosphere by [[lightning]] and by [[Legume|leguminous]] plants such as [[clover]].\n\nFire has been used by humans in [[fire worship|rituals]], in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, [[smelting]], [[forging]], [[incineration]] of waste, [[cremation]], and as a weapon or mode of destruction.\n\n==Physical properties==\n\n===Chemistry===\n{{Main article|Combustion}}\n[[File:Fire tetrahedron.svg|thumb|left|The fire [[tetrahedron]]]]\nFires start when a [[flammable]] or a combustible material, in combination with a sufficient quantity of an [[oxidizer]] such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of [[heat]] or ambient [[temperature]] above the [[flash point]] for the [[fuel]]/oxidizer mix, and is able to sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a [[chain reaction]]. This is commonly called the [[Fire triangle|fire tetrahedron]]. Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions. For example, a flammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions. Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a [[catalyst]], a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any [[chemical]] reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.\n\nOnce ignited, a chain reaction must take place whereby fires can sustain their own heat by the further release of heat energy in the process of combustion and may propagate, provided there is a continuous supply of an oxidizer and fuel.\n\nIf the oxidizer is oxygen from the surrounding air, the presence of a force of [[gravity]], or of some similar force caused by acceleration, is necessary to produce [[convection]], which removes combustion products and brings a supply of oxygen to the fire. Without gravity, a fire rapidly surrounds itself with its own combustion products and non-oxidizing gases from the air, which exclude oxygen and [[wikt:extinguish|extinguish]] the fire. Because of this, the risk of fire in a [[spacecraft]] is small when it is [[Orbital maneuver|coasting]] in inertial flight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuFftT6ZR4k|title=Ask Astronaut Greg Chamitoff: Light a Match!|first=|last=NASA Johnson|date=29 August 2008|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5779127/how-does-fire-behave-in-zero-gravity|title=How does fire behave in zero gravity?|first=Esther|last=Inglis-Arkell|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>This does not apply if oxygen is supplied to the fire by some process other than thermal convection.\n\nFire can be [[fire protection|extinguished]] by removing any one of the elements of the fire tetrahedron. Consider a natural gas flame, such as from a stove-top burner. The fire can be extinguished by any of the following:\n* turning off the gas supply, which removes the fuel source;\n* covering the flame completely, which smothers the flame as the combustion both uses the available oxidizer (the oxygen in the air) and displaces it from the area around the flame with CO<sub>2</sub>;\n* application of water, which removes heat from the fire faster than the fire can produce it (similarly, blowing hard on a flame will displace the heat of the currently burning gas from its fuel source, to the same end), or\n* application of a retardant chemical such as [[halomethane#Fire extinguishing|Halon]] to the flame, which retards the chemical reaction itself until the rate of combustion is too slow to maintain the chain reaction.\n\nIn contrast, fire is intensified by increasing the overall rate of combustion. Methods to do this include balancing the input of fuel and oxidizer to [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] proportions, increasing fuel and oxidizer input in this balanced mix, increasing the ambient temperature so the fire's own heat is better able to sustain combustion, or providing a catalyst; a non-reactant medium in which the fuel and oxidizer can more readily react.\n\n===Flame===\n{{Main article|Flame}}\n{{See also|Flame test}}\n[[File:Candle-light-animated.gif|thumb|upright|A [[candle]]'s [[flame]]]]\n[[File:Northwest Crown Fire Experiment.png|thumb|Northwest Crown Fire Experiment, Canada]]\n[[File:Fire.JPG|thumb|upright|Photo of a fire taken with a 1/4000th of a second exposure]]\n[[File:Space Fire.jpg|thumb|Fire is affected by gravity. Left: Flame on Earth; Right: Flame on the [[International Space Station|ISS]]]]\nA flame is a mixture of reacting gases and solids emitting visible, [[infrared]], and sometimes [[ultraviolet]] light, the [[frequency spectrum]] of which depends on the chemical composition of the burning material and intermediate reaction products. In many cases, such as the burning of [[organic matter]], for example wood, or the incomplete [[combustion]] of gas, [[incandescent]] solid particles called [[soot]] produce the familiar red-orange glow of 'fire'. This light has a [[continuous spectrum]]. Complete combustion of gas has a dim blue color due to the emission of single-wavelength radiation from various electron transitions in the excited molecules formed in the flame. Usually oxygen is involved, but [[hydrogen]] burning in [[chlorine]] also produces a flame, producing [[hydrogen chloride]] (HCl). Other possible combinations producing flames, amongst many, are [[fluorine]] and [[hydrogen]], and [[hydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]]. Hydrogen and hydrazine/[[UDMH]] flames are similarly pale blue, while burning [[boron]] and its compounds, evaluated in mid-20th century as a [[Zip fuel|high energy fuel]] for [[Jet engine|jet]] and [[rocket engine]]s, emits intense green flame, leading to its informal nickname of \"Green Dragon\".\n\nThe glow of a flame is complex. [[Black body radiation|Black-body radiation]] is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles are too small to behave like perfect blackbodies. There is also [[photon]] emission by de-excited [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s in the gases. Much of the radiation is emitted in the visible and infrared bands. The color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the [[emission spectra]]. The dominant color in a flame changes with temperature. The photo of the forest fire in Canada is an excellent example of this variation. Near the ground, where most burning is occurring, the fire is white, the hottest color possible for organic material in general, or yellow. Above the yellow region, the color changes to orange, which is cooler, then red, which is cooler still. Above the red region, combustion no longer occurs, and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black [[smoke]].\n\nThe common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on [[convection]], as soot tends to rise to the top of a general flame, as in a [[candle]] in normal gravity conditions, making it yellow. In [[Weightlessness|micro gravity or zero gravity]],<ref>[https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast12may_1.htm Spiral flames in microgravity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100319113411/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast12may_1.htm |date=2010-03-19 }}, [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], 2000.</ref> such as an environment in [[outer space]], convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient (although it may go out if not moved steadily, as the CO<sub>2</sub> from combustion does not disperse as readily in micro gravity, and tends to smother the flame). There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs.<ref>[http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/combustion/cfm/usml-1_results.htm CFM-1 experiment results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912095009/http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/combustion/cfm/usml-1_results.htm |date=2007-09-12 }}, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, April 2005.</ref> Experiments by [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] reveal that [[diffusion flame]]s in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions.<ref>[http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/combustion/lsp/lsp1_results.htm LSP-1 experiment results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312020123/http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/combustion/lsp/lsp1_results.htm |date=2007-03-12 }}, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, April 2005.</ref> These discoveries have potential applications in [[applied science]] and [[industry]], especially concerning [[fuel efficiency]].\n\nIn [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engines]], various steps are taken to eliminate a flame.

Objects whose surface is at a temperature above approximately {{convert|400|C}} will glow, emitting light at a color that indicates the temperature of that surface. See the section on [[red heat]] for more about this effect. It is a misconception that one can judge the temperature of a fire by the color of its flames or the sparks in the flames.

Cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and autumn. They clear undergrowth, burning up [[biomass]] that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense. They provide a greater variety of environments, which encourages game and plant diversity. For humans, they make dense, impassable forests traversable. Another human use for fire in regards to landscape management is its use to clear land for agriculture. Slash-and-burn agriculture is still common across much of tropical Africa, Asia and South America. \"For small farmers, it is a convenient way to clear overgrown areas and release nutrients from standing vegetation back into the soil,\" said Miguel Pinedo-Vasquez, an ecologist at the [http://www.cerc.columbia.edu/ Earth Institute\u2019s Center for Environmental Research and Conservation].<ref name=\"blogs.ei.columbia.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/11/16/farmers-flames-and-climate-are-we-entering-an-age-of-mega-fires/ |title=Farmers, Flames and Climate: Are We Entering an Age of \u2018Mega-Fires\u2019? \u2013 State of the Planet |publisher=Blogs.ei.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref> However this useful strategy is also problematic. Growing population, fragmentation of forests and warming climate are making the earth's surface more prone to ever-larger escaped fires. These harm ecosystems and human infrastructure, cause health problems, and send up spirals of carbon and soot that may encourage even more warming of the atmosphere \u2013 and thus feed back into more fires. Globally today, as much as 5 million square kilometres \u2013 an area more than half the size of the United States \u2013 burns in a given year.<ref name=\"blogs.ei.columbia.edu\"/>\n\nThere are numerous modern applications of fire. In its broadest sense, fire is used by nearly every human being on earth in a controlled setting every day. Users of [[internal combustion]] vehicles employ fire every time they drive. Thermal [[power station]]s provide [[electricity]] for a large percentage of humanity.\n[[File:Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945.

[[Homer]] detailed the use of fire by Greek soldiers who hid in a [[Trojan Horse|wooden horse]] to burn [[Troy]] during the [[Trojan war]]. Later the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] fleet used [[Greek fire]] to attack ships and men. In the [[World War I|First World War]], the first modern [[flamethrower]]s were used by infantry, and were successfully mounted on armoured vehicles in the Second World War. In the latter war, [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]] were used by [[Axis Powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] alike, notably on Tokyo, Rotterdam, London, Hamburg and, notoriously, at [[Dresden]]; in the latter two cases [[firestorm]]s were deliberately caused in which a ring of fire surrounding each city{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} was drawn inward by an updraft caused by a central cluster of fires. The United States Army Air Force also extensively used incendiaries against Japanese targets in the latter months of the war, devastating entire cities constructed primarily of wood and paper houses.

FIDE was largely happy with the \"London Rules\", but claimed that the requirement for a purse of $10,000 was impracticable and called upon Capablanca to come to an agreement with the leading masters to revise the Rules.<ref name=\"WinterChessNotesArchive17\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter17.html\n | title=Chess Notes Archive [17]\n | author=Winter, E.\n}}</ref>\n\nFIDE's third congress, in Budapest in 1926, also decided to organize a [[Chess Olympiad]]. The invitations were, however, late in being sent, with the result that only four countries participated, and the competition was called the Little Olympiad. The winner was Hungary, followed by [[Yugoslavia]], Romania, and Germany. In 1927, FIDE began organizing the First Chess Olympiad during its 4th Congress in [[London]]. The official title of the tournament was the \"Tournament of Nations\", or \"World Team Championship\", but \"Chess Olympiad\" became a more popular title. The event was won by Hungary, with 16 teams competing.<ref name=\"WallFIDEHistory\" />\n\nIn 1928 FIDE recognized Bogoljubow as \"Champion of FIDE\" after he won a match against [[Max Euwe]].<ref name=\"WinterChessNotesArchive17\" /> Alekhine, the reigning world champion, attended part of the 1928 Congress and agreed to place future matches for the world title under the auspices of FIDE, although any match with Capablanca should be under the same conditions as in Buenos Aires, 1927, i.e. including the requirement for a purse of at least $10,000. FIDE accepted this and decided to form a commission to modify the London Rules for future matches, though this commission never met; by the time of the 1929 Congress, a world championship match between Alekhine and Bogoljubow was under way, held neither under the auspices of FIDE nor in accordance with the London Rules.<ref name=\"WinterChessNotesArchive17\" />\n\nWhile negotiating his 1937 World Championship re-match with Alekhine, Euwe proposed that if he retained the title, FIDE should manage the nomination of future challengers and the conduct of championship matches. FIDE had been trying since 1935 to introduce rules on how to select challengers, and its various proposals favored selection by some sort of committee. While they were debating procedures in 1937 and Alekhine and Euwe were preparing for their re-match later that year, the [[Dutch Chess Federation]] proposed that a super-tournament (AVRO) of ex-champions and rising stars should be held to select the next challenger. FIDE rejected this proposal and at their second attempt nominated [[Salo Flohr]] as the official challenger. Euwe then declared that: if he retained his title against Alekhine he was prepared to meet Flohr in 1940 but he reserved the right to arrange a title match either in 1938 or 1939 with [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], who had lost the title to Alekhine in 1927; if Euwe lost his title to Capablanca then FIDE's decision should be followed and Capablanca would have to play Flohr in 1940. Most chess writers and players strongly supported the Dutch super-tournament proposal and opposed the committee processes favored by FIDE. While this confusion went unresolved: Euwe lost his title to Alekhine; the [[AVRO tournament]] in 1938 was won by [[Paul Keres]] under a tie-breaking rule, with [[Reuben Fine]] placed second and Capablanca and Flohr in the bottom places; and the outbreak of World War II in 1939 cut short the controversy.<ref name=\"WinterWorldChampionshipDisorder\">{{cite web\n | title=World Championship Disorder\n | url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/disorder.html\n | author=Winter, E.\n}}</ref><ref name=\"EndgameAVRO1938\">{{cite web\n |title       = AVRO 1938\n |url         = http://www.endgame.nl/AVRO1938.htm\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081020142455/http://www.endgame.nl/AVRO1938.htm\n |archivedate = October 20, 2008\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> Although competitive chess continued in many countries, including some that were under [[Nazi]] occupation, there was no international competition and FIDE was inactive during the war.\n\n===1946 to 1993===\n\n====Birth of the World Championship challenge cycle====\nFrom the time of [[Emanuel Lasker]]'s defeat of [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] in 1894, until 1946, a new World Champion had won the title by defeating the former champion in a match. [[Alexander Alekhine]]'s death created an ''[[Interregnum of World Chess Champions|interregnum]]'' that made the normal procedure impossible. The situation was confused, with many respected players and commentators offering different solutions. FIDE found it difficult to organize the early discussions on how to resolve the ''[[interregnum]]'', because problems with money and travel in the aftermath of World War II prevented many countries from sending representatives, most notably the Soviet Union. The shortage of clear information resulted in otherwise responsible magazines publishing rumors and speculation, which only made the situation more confused.<ref name=\"Winter2003Interregnum\" /> See [[Interregnum of World Chess Champions]] for more details.\n\nThis situation was exacerbated by the Soviet Union having long refused to join FIDE, and by this time it was clear that about half the credible contenders were Soviet citizens. The Soviet Union realized, however, it could not afford to be left out of the discussions regarding the vacant world championship, and in 1947 sent a telegram apologizing for the absence of Soviet representatives and requesting that the USSR be represented in future FIDE Committees.<ref name=\"Winter2003Interregnum\" />\n\nThe eventual solution was similar to FIDE's initial proposal and to a proposal put forward by the Soviet Union (authored by [[Mikhail Botvinnik]]). The 1938 [[AVRO tournament]] was used as the basis for the [[World Chess Championship 1948|1948 Championship Tournament]]. The AVRO tournament had brought together the eight players who were, by general acclamation, the best players in the world at the time. Two of the participants at AVRO\u2014Alekhine and former world champion Capablanca\u2014had since died; but FIDE decided that the other six participants at AVRO would play a quadruple [[round-robin tournament]]. These players were: [[Max Euwe]] (from The Netherlands); Botvinnik, [[Paul Keres]] and [[Salo Flohr]] (from the Soviet Union); and [[Reuben Fine]] and [[Samuel Reshevsky]] (from the United States). FIDE soon accepted a Soviet request to substitute [[Vasily Smyslov]] for Flohr, and Fine withdrew in order to continue his degree studies in [[psychiatry]], so five players competed, in a quintuple round robin. Botvinnik won, thus becoming world champion, ending the ''interregnum''.<ref name=\"Winter2003Interregnum\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/interregnum.html\n | title=Interregnum\n | author=Winter, E.\n | date=2003\u20132004\n | publisher=Chess History Center\n}}</ref>\n\nThe proposals which led to the 1948 Championship Tournament also specified the procedure by which challengers for the World Championship would be selected in a three-year cycle: countries affiliated with FIDE would send players to Zonal tournaments (the number varied depending on the number of strong players each country had); the players who gained the top places in these would compete in an Interzonal tournament (later split into two, then three tournaments as the number of countries and eligible players increased<ref name=\"WeeksWorldChampionshipEvents1948to1990\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/wcc-indy.htm\n | title=World Chess Championship FIDE Events 1948\u20131990\n | author=Weeks, M.\n}}</ref>); the highest-placed players from the Interzonal would compete in the [[Candidates Tournament]], along with the loser of the previous title match and the runner-up in the previous Candidates Tournament; and the winner of the Candidates played a title match against the champion.<ref name=\"Winter2003Interregnum\" /> From 1950 until 1962 inclusive, the Candidates Tournament was a multi-round round-robin\u2014how and why it was changed are described below.\n\n====Bobby Fischer controversies====\nFIDE found itself embroiled in some controversies relating to the American player [[Bobby Fischer]], the first of which took place when Fischer alleged that at the 1962 [[Candidates Tournament]] in [[Cura\u00e7ao]], the Soviet players [[Tigran Petrosian]], [[Paul Keres]] and [[Efim Geller]] had pre-arranged draws in their games played amongst themselves, and that [[Viktor Korchnoi]], another Soviet player, had been instructed to lose to them (Fischer had [[World Chess Championship 1963|placed 4th]], well behind Petrosian, Keres and Geller). Grandmaster [[Yuri Averbakh]], a member of the Soviet delegation at the tournament, said in 2002 that Petrosian, Keres and Geller privately agreed to draw their games, and a statistical analysis in 2006 supported this conclusion.<ref name=\"Kingston2002AverbakhInterview2\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles183.pdf\n |format=PDF| title=Yuri Averbakh, An Interview with History, Part 2\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | publisher=chesscafe.com\n | year=2002}}</ref><ref name=\"MouleNye2006DidSovietsCollude\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://weber.ucsd.edu/~jlbroz/PElunch/sovietchesscartel.pdf\n |format      = PDF\n |title       = Did the Soviets Collude?: A Statistical Analysis of Championship Chess 1940\u201364\n |author1     = Moul, C.\n |author2     = Nye, J.V.C.\n |publisher   = Washington University in St. Louis\n |year        = 2006\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/5nXCdC5r8?url=http://weber.ucsd.edu/~jlbroz/PElunch/sovietchesscartel.pdf\n |archivedate = February 14, 2010\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> FIDE responded by changing the format of Candidates Tournaments from a multi-round round-robin to a series of elimination matches, initially 10\u201312 games in duration, though by the 1970s, the Candidates final would be as long as 24 games.\n\nIn 1969, Fischer refused to play in the U.S. Championship because of disagreements about the tournament's format and prize fund. Since that event was being treated as a [[Interzonal|Zonal tournament]], Fischer forfeited his right to compete for the right to challenge World Champion [[Boris Spassky]] in 1972. Grandmaster [[Pal Benko]] agreed to relinquish his qualifying place at the Interzonal in Fischer's favor, and the other participants waived their right to claim the spot. FIDE president Max Euwe interpreted the rules very flexibly to allow Fischer to play in the 1970 Interzonal at [[Palma de Mallorca]], which he won convincingly. Fischer then crushed [[Mark Taimanov]], [[Bent Larsen]] (both 6-0) and Tigran Petrosian in the 1971 Candidates\nTournament and won the title match with Spassky to become world champion.<ref name=\"Sosonko2001RememberingEuwePart1\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles167.pdf\n |format=PDF| title=Remembering Max Euwe Part 1\n | author=[[Gennadi Sosonko]]\n | year=2001\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter winning the world championship, Fischer criticized the existing championship match format (24 games; the champion retained the title if the match was tied) on the grounds that it encouraged whoever got an early lead to play for draws. While this dispute was going on, [[Anatoly Karpov]] won the right to challenge in 1975. Fischer refused to accept any match format other than the one he proposed. Among Fischer's demands was a requirement that the challenger must beat him by at least two games in order to take his title (Fischer proposed a match format in which the first player to win 10 games wins, with draws not counting, but if the result is 9-9 it is considered a tie). The FIDE argued that it was unfair for a challenger to be able to beat the world champion, yet not take his title. Fischer would not back down, and eventually FIDE awarded the title to Karpov by default.<ref name=\"WeeksFischerForfeitsToKarpov\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/7375$wix.htm\n |title=World Chess Championship 1975 \u2013 Fischer forfeits to Karpov\n | author=Weeks, M.\n | publisher=Mark Weeks\n}}</ref> Some commentators have questioned whether FIDE president Max Euwe did as much as he could have to prevent Fischer from forfeiting his world title.<ref name=\"Sosonko2001RememberingEuwePart1\" />\n\n====Other 1970s controversies====\nFIDE had a number of conflicts with the [[Soviet Chess Federation]]. These conflicts included:<ref name=\"Sosonko2001RememberingEuwePart1\" />\n* The defection of grandmaster [[Gennadi Sosonko]] in 1972. The Soviets demanded that Sosonko be excluded from competitive chess, television or any other event that might publicize his defection. FIDE refused, and no Soviet players took part in the 1974 [[Wijk aan Zee]] tournament in The Netherlands because Sosonko was playing in it.\n* In 1976 world championship contender [[Viktor Korchnoi]] sought [[political asylum]] in The Netherlands. In a discussion a few days earlier Euwe told Korchnoi, \"...of course you will retain all your rights ...\" and later opposed Soviet efforts to prevent Korchnoi from challenging for [[Anatoly Karpov]]'s title in 1978.\n* FIDE decided to hold the 1976 [[Chess Olympiad]] in Israel, which the Soviet Union did not [[Diplomatic recognition|recognize]] as a country. The [[Central Committee]] of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] then started plotting to depose Euwe as president of FIDE.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n====Rapid expansion of membership====\nDuring his period as president of FIDE (1970\u20131978) [[Max Euwe]] strove to increase the number of member countries, and [[Florencio Campomanes]] (president 1982\u20131995) continued this policy, with each member nation receiving one vote.

While arranging the [[Candidates Tournament]] semi-final matches to be played in 1983, FIDE accepted bids to host Kasparov versus [[Victor Korchnoi]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. The Soviet Union refused to accept this, either because it feared Kasparov would [[Defection|defect]] or because it thought Kasparov was the greater threat to reigning champion [[Anatoly Karpov]]. Their refusal would have meant that Kasparov forfeited his chance of challenging for the title. FIDE president [[Florencio Campomanes]] negotiated with the Soviet Union, and the match was played in London.<ref name=\"AbundoCampomanesLegacy\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.fide.com/news/download/campolegacy.doc\n | title=Campo's Legacy to World Chess\n | author=Abundo, C.\n | publisher=FIDE\n}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes1983CrisisLooming\">{{cite news\n | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E7DB1E39F935A3575BC0A965948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all\n | title= A crisis is looming in chess world\n | date=August 6, 1983\n | author=Burns, J.F.\n | publisher=New York Times\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1984 world championship match between Karpov and Kasparov the winner was to be the first to win six games.

After six days of talks, on February 15, FIDE president Campomanes announced that \"the match is ended without decision\", that a new one would begin in September 1985 with the score 0\u20130, and that it would consist of at most 24 games. Karpov entered the press conference rather late and said he wished to continue the existing match, with his version of the Mark Twain line: \"The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated!\" Although nobody has revealed what had happened behind the scenes, there were ESPN cameras and  reporters from Sports Illustrated in addition to American Grandmaster Max Dlugy. When the good cop-bad cop routine of Karpov and Campomanes caused a commotion an agitated Karpov stared at Campomanes, who was caught on film saying: \"But Anatoly, I told them what you said!\" Dlugy also reported this event in the US magazine Chess Life.

FIDE very quickly accepted a bid from [[Manchester]] (England) to host the title match in 1993. But at that time Short was travelling to Greece and could not be consulted as FIDE's rules required. On learning of the situation Short contacted Kasparov, who had distrusted FIDE and its president, [[Florencio Campomanes]] ever since Campomanes had stopped his title match against [[Anatoly Karpov]] in 1984.  Kasparov and Short concluded that FIDE had failed to get them the best financial deal available and announced that they would \"play under the auspices of a new body, the \"[[Professional Chess Association]]\" (PCA). FIDE stripped Kasparov of his FIDE title and dropped Kasparov and Short from the official rating list. It also announced a title match between Karpov and [[Jan Timman]], whom Short had defeated in the semi-final and final stages of the Candidates Tournament.

In 2000 [[Vladimir Kramnik]] defeated Kasparov in a match for what was now the Braingames World Chess Championship (the PCA had collapsed by this time). But Kramnik was also unwilling to play in a qualifying series, and objected strongly to FIDE's attempt to have the world championship decided by annual knock-out tournaments and to reduce the time limits for games, changes which FIDE hoped would make the game more interesting to outsiders.<ref name = \"aboutChessUnification 1994to2006\" /><ref name=\"kramnik2005CivilizedDialogue\">{{cite web | url = http://www.kramnik.com/eng/interviews/getinterview.aspx?id=35 | title = Vladimir Kramnik: \"I am ready for a civilized dialogue with FIDE\" | last = Vasiliev | first = Y | publisher = [[Vladimir Kramnik]] | date = November 14, 2004 | access-date = January 9, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015125720/http://kramnik.com/eng/interviews/getinterview.aspx?id=35 | archive-date = October 15, 2007 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nFinally in 2006 a re-unification match was played between Kramnik and [[Veselin Topalov]], which Kramnik won after an unpleasant controversy which led to one game being awarded to Topalov.<ref name = \"aboutChessUnification 1994to2006\" /><ref name = \"chessgames2006Toiletgate\">{{cite web | url = http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=52037 | title=Kramnik vs Topalov, 2006 \u2013 Toiletgate in Elista | publisher= Chess games}}</ref>\n\nBut the split in the world-title had after-effects, as shown by FIDE's complicated regulations for the 2007\u20139 world championship cycle. Because Topalov was unable to compete in the [[World Chess Championship 2007|2007 World Chess Championship Tournament]], FIDE decided he should have a \"fast track\" entry into the 2007\u20132009 cycle. And FIDE also decided that, if Kramnik did not win the 2007 championship tournament, he should play a championship match in 2008 against the winner\u2014and this provision became applicable because [[Viswanathan Anand]] won the tournament and thus became world champion.\n\n====IOC recognition====\nIn 1999, FIDE was recognised by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).

This caused a 13-year split in the world title. During the split, FIDE for a time (1998\u20132004) ran its championships as a single knock-out tournament with games under quicker time controls, a change which proved controversial. Another controversy was holding the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2004|2004 Tournament]] in Libya. From 2002 to 2005 FIDE failed to organize matches for the 2002 \"Prague Agreement\" to re-unite the world title, until the world title was finally re-unified by the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2006|2006 Kramnik-Topalov match]].\n\nAs of 2007, the format of the World Championship looks set to change again, and has again been the subject of criticism from the [[Association of Chess Professionals]] (ACP) as well as individual players.\n\nIn 1999, FIDE was recognised by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).

Cognitive enhancement is now a real concern in chess competitions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hamblin|first1=James|title=On Cognitive Doping in Chess (and Life)|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/03/cognitive-enhancement-paradox/519948/|accessdate=21 March 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=21 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn June 2, 2006 [[delegate]]s from more than 150 national chess federations cast their ballots in [[Turin]], Italy, to elect the president of FIDE.

[[Polarized sunglasses]] block the ''s'' polarization, greatly reducing glare from horizontal surfaces.}}\n\nThe '''Fresnel equations''' (or '''Fresnel coefficients''') describe the reflection and transmission of [[light]] (or [[electromagnetic radiation]] in general) when incident on an interface between different optical [[medium (optics)|media]]. They were deduced by [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] ({{IPAc-en|f|r|e\u026a|\u02c8|n|\u025b|l}}) who was the first to understand that light is a [[transverse wave]], even though no one realized that the \"vibrations\" of the wave were electric and magnetic fields. For the first time, [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] could be understood quantitatively, as Fresnel's equations correctly predicted the differing behaviour of waves of the ''s'' and ''p'' polarizations incident upon a material interface.\n\n==Overview==\nWhen light strikes the interface of a medium of a given [[refractive index]], ''n''<sub>1</sub> and a second medium with refractive index, ''n''<sub>2</sub>, both [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]] of the light may occur. The Fresnel equations describe the ratio of the reflected and transmitted electric fields to that of the incident beam (the waves' magnetic fields can also be related using similar coefficients). Since these are complex ratios,  they describe not only the relative amplitude, but [[Reflection phase shift|phase shift]]s between the waves.\n\nThe equations assume the interface between the media is flat and that the media are homogeneous and [[isotropy|isotropic]].<ref>Born & Wolf, 1970, p.{{hsp}}38.</ref> The incident light is assumed to be a [[plane wave]], which is sufficient to solve any problem since any incident light field can be decomposed into plane waves and polarizations.\n\n===S and P polarizations===\n{{main|S and p polarizations}}\nThere are two sets of Fresnel coefficients for two different linear [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]  components of the incident wave. Since any [[Polarization (waves)#Polarization state|polarization state]] can be resolved into a combination of two orthogonal linear polarizations, this is sufficient for any problem. Likewise, [[Polarization (waves)#Unpolarized and partially polarized light|unpolarized]] (or \"randomly polarized\") light has an equal amount of power in each of two linear polarizations. \n\nThe s polarization refers to polarization of a wave's electric field ''normal'' to the plane of incidence (the Z direction in the derivation below); then the magnetic field is ''in'' the plane of incidence. P polarization refers to polarization of the electric field ''in'' the plane of incidence (along the X and Y directions in the derivation below); then the magnetic field is ''normal'' to the plane of incidence.\n\nAlthough the reflectivity and transmission are dependent on polarization,  at normal incidence (\u03b8=0) there is no distinction between them so all polarization states are governed by a single set of Fresnel coefficients (and also another special case is mentioned below in which that is true).\n\n==Power (intensity) reflection and transmission coefficients==\n[[File:Fresnel1.svg|right|thumb|300px|Variables used in the Fresnel equations]]\n[[File:Fresnel power air-to-glass.svg|thumb|right|Power coefficients: air to glass]]\n[[File:Fresnel power glass-to-air.svg|thumb|right|Power coefficients: glass to air]]\nIn the diagram on the right, an incident [[plane wave]] in the direction of the ray '''IO''', strikes the interface between two media of refractive indices ''n''<sub>1</sub> and ''n''<sub>2</sub> at point '''O'''. Part of the wave is reflected in the direction  '''OR''', and part refracted in the direction '''OT'''. The angles of the incident, reflected and refracted waves make to the [[surface normal|normal]] of the interface are given as ''\u03b8''<sub>i</sub>, ''\u03b8''<sub>r</sub> and ''\u03b8''<sub>t</sub>, respectively.\n\nThe relationship between these angles is given by the [[law of reflection]]:\n:<math>\\theta_\\mathrm{i} = \\theta_\\mathrm{r},</math>\n\nand [[Snell's law]]:\n:<math>n_1 \\sin \\theta_\\mathrm{i} = n_2 \\sin \\theta_\\mathrm{t}.</math>\n\nThe behaviour of light striking the interface is solved by considering the electric and magnetic fields that constitute an [[electromagnetic wave]], and the laws of [[Maxwell's equations|electromagnetism]] as shown [[#Theory|below]]. The ratio of waves' electric field (or magnetic field) amplitudes are supplied, but in practice one is more often interested in formulae which determine ''power'' coefficients, since power (or [[irradiance]]) is what can be directly measured at optical frequencies. The power of a wave is generally proportional to the square of the electric (or magnetic) field amplitude.\n\nWe call the fraction of the incident [[Power (physics)|power]] that is reflected from the interface the [[reflectance]] (or \"reflectivity\", or \"power reflection coefficient\") ''R'', and the fraction that is refracted into the second medium is called the transmittance (or \"transmissivity\", or \"power transmission coefficient\") ''T''{{tsp}}. Note that these are what would be measured right ''at'' each side of an interface and do not account for attenuation of a wave in an absorbing medium ''following'' transmission or reflection.<ref>Hecht, 1987, p.{{hsp}}100.</ref>\n\n\nThe [[reflectance]] for [[s-polarized light]] is\n<!--  EDIT WITH CARE!

That number could be obtained from irradiances ''in the direction of an incident or reflected wave'' (given by the magnitude of a wave's [[Poynting vector]]) multiplied by cos(\u03b8) for a wave at an angle \u03b8 to the normal direction (or equivalently, taking the dot product of the Poynting vector with the unit vector normal to the interface). For just considering reflection, since cos(\u03b8<sub>i</sub>) = cos(\u03b8<sub>r</sub>), the ratio of reflected to incident irradiance in the wave's direction is the same as the ratio of the power flow in the normal direction, and this complication can be ignored.\n\nAlthough these relationships describe the basic physics, in many practical applications one is concerned with \"natural light\" that can be describe as unpolarized. That means that there is an equal amount of power in the ''s'' and ''p'' polarizations, so that the ''effective'' reflectivity of the material is just the average of the two reflectivities:\n:<math>R_\\mathrm{eff} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(R_\\mathrm{s} + R_\\mathrm{p}\\right).</math>\n\nFor low-precision applications involving unpolarized light, such as [[computer graphics]], rather than rigorously computing the effective reflection coefficient for each angle, [[Schlick's approximation]] is often used.\n\n===Special cases===\n====Normal incidence====\nFor the case of [[normal incidence]], <math> \\theta_\\mathrm{i} = \\theta_\\mathrm{t} = 0</math>, and there is no distinction between s and p polarization.  Thus, the reflectance simplifies to\n:<math>\nR = \\left|\\frac{n_1  - n_2 }{n_1 + n_2 }\\right|^2\n</math>.\n\nFor common glass (''n''<sub>2</sub>  \u2248 1.5) surrounded by air (''n''<sub>1</sub>=1), the power reflectance at normal incidence can be seen to be about 4%, or 8% accounting for both sides of a glass pane.\n\n====Brewster's angle====\n{{main|Brewster's angle}}\nAt a dielectric interface from  {{math|''n''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''n''<sub>2</sub>}}, there is a particular angle of incidence at which {{math|''R''<sub>p</sub>}} goes to zero and a p-polarised incident wave is purely refracted. This angle is known as [[Brewster's angle]], and is around 56\u00b0 for ''n''<sub>1</sub>  = 1 and ''n''<sub>2</sub>=1.5 (typical glass). \n\n====Total internal reflection====\n{{main|Total internal reflection}}\nWhen light travelling in a denser medium strikes the surface of a less dense medium (i.e., {{math|1=''n''<sub>1</sub> &gt; ''n''<sub>2</sub>}}), beyond a particular incidence angle known as the ''critical angle'', all light is reflected and {{math|1=''R''<sub>s</sub> = ''R''<sub>p</sub> = 1}}. This phenomenon is known as [[total internal reflection]]. Total internal reflection occurs for incidence angles for which, using Snell's law, the sine of the angle of refraction would exceed unity (whereas sin(\u03b8) \u2264 1 for all real \u03b8). Again assuming glass with ''n''=1.5 surrounded by air, the critical angle is approximately 41\u00b0.\n\n==Amplitude reflection and transmission coefficients{{anchor|Field}}==\nThe above ''practical'' equations relating powers (which could be measured with a [[photometer]] for instance) are derived from the actual Fresnel equations which solve the physical problem in terms of  electric and magnetic field amplitudes. Those underlying equations supply generally complex-valued ratios of those amplitudes and may take several different forms, depending on formalisms used. The amplitude coefficients are usually represented by lower case ''r'' and ''t'' (whereas the power coefficients are capitalized).\n[[File:Fresnel amplitudes air-to-glass.svg|thumb|right|Amplitude coefficients: air to glass]]\n[[File:Fresnel amplitudes glass-to-air.svg|thumb|right|Amplitude coefficients: glass to air]]\n\nIn the following, the reflection coefficient {{math|''r''}} is the ratio of the reflected wave's [[complex number|complex]] electric field amplitude to that of the incident wave. The transmission coefficient {{math|''t''}} is the ratio of the transmitted wave's electric field amplitude to that of the incident wave. We require separate formulae for the ''s'' and ''p'' polarizations. In each case we assume an incident plane wave at an [[Angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]  <math> \\theta_\\mathrm{i}</math> on a plane interface, reflected at an angle <math> \\theta_\\mathrm{r}</math>, and with a transmitted wave at an angle <math> \\theta_\\mathrm{t}</math>,  corresponding to the above figure. Note that in the cases of an interface into an absorbing material (where ''n'' is complex) or total internal reflection, the angle of transmission might not evaluate to a real number.\n\nWe consider the sign of a wave's electric field in relation to a wave's direction. Consequently for ''p'' polarization at normal incidence, the positive direction of electric field for an incident wave (to the left) is ''opposite'' that of a reflected wave (also to its left); for ''s'' polarization both are the same (upward). <ref group=Note>Some authors use the opposite sign convention for {{math|''r''<sub>p</sub>}}, so that {{math|''r''<sub>p</sub>}} is positive when the incoming and reflected magnetic fields are anti-parallel, and negative when they are parallel. This latter convention has the convenient advantage that the s and p sign conventions are the same at normal incidence. However, either convention, when used consistently, gives the right answers.</ref>\n\nUsing these conventions,.<ref name=Sernelius>Lecture notes by Bo Sernelius, [http://www.ifm.liu.se/courses/TFYY67/ main site], see especially [http://www.ifm.liu.se/courses/TFYY67/Lect12.pdf Lecture 12].</ref><ref>Born & Wolf, 1970, p.{{hsp}}40, eqs.{{tsp}}(20),{{hsp}}(21).</ref>\n<!--  EDIT WITH CARE!

One can write similar equations applying to the ratio of magnetic fields of the waves, but these are usually not required.\n\nBecause the reflected and incident waves propagate in the same medium and make the same angle with the normal to the surface, the power reflection coefficient R is just the squared magnitude of ''r'':{{hsp}}<ref>Hecht, 2002, p.{{hsp}}120, eq.{{hsp}}(4.56).</ref>\n:<math>R = |r|^2.</math>\n\nOn the other hand, calculation of the power transmission coefficient {{mvar|T}} is less straight-forward, since the light travels in different directions in the two media. What's more, the wave impedances in the two media differ; power is only proportional to the square of the amplitude when the media's impedances are the same (as they are for the reflected wave). This results in<ref>Hecht, 2002, p.{{hsp}}120, eq.{{hsp}}(4.57).</ref>:\n:<math>T = \\frac{n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\text{t}}{n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\text{i}} |t|^2.</math>\n\nThe factor of {{math|''n''<sub>2</sub>/''n''<sub>1</sub>}} is the reciprocal of the ratio of the media's [[wave impedance]]s (since we assume \u03bc=1). The factor of {{math|cos(''\u03b8''<sub>t</sub>)/cos(''\u03b8''<sub>i</sub>)}} is from expressing power ''in the direction'' normal to the interface, for both the incident and transmitted waves.\n\nIn the case of [[total internal reflection]] where the power transmission T=0, ''t'' nevertheless describes the electric field (including its phase) just beyond the interface. This is an [[evanescent field]] which does not propagate as a wave (thus T=0) but has nonzero values very close to the interface. The phase shift of the reflected wave on total internal reflection can similarly be obtained from the [[Argument (complex analysis)|phase angles]] of {{math|''r''<sub>p</sub>}} and {{math|''r''<sub>s</sub>}} (whose magnitudes are unity). These phase shifts are different for  ''s'' and ''p'' waves, which is the well-known principle by which total internal reflection is used to effect [[Fresnel rhomb|polarization transformations]].\n\n===Alternative forms===\n\nIn the above formula for {{math|''r''<sub>s</sub>{{px2}}}}, if we put <math>n_2=n_1\\sin\\theta_\\text{i}/\\sin\\theta_\\text{t}</math> (Snell's law) and multiply the numerator and denominator by {{math|{{sfrac|1|''n''<sub>1</sub>}}{{tsp}}sin{{tsp}}''\u03b8''<sub>t</sub>{{px2}}}}, we&nbsp;obtain{{hsp}}<ref>Fresnel, 1866, p.{{hsp}}773.</ref><ref>Hecht, 2002, p.{{hsp}}115, eq.{{hsp}}(4.42).</ref>\n\n:<math>r_\\text{s}=-\\frac{\\sin(\\theta_\\text{i}-\\theta_\\text{t})}{\\sin(\\theta_\\text{i}+\\theta_\\text{t})}.</math>\n\nIf we do likewise with the formula for {{math|''r''<sub>p</sub>{{px2}}}}, the result is easily shown to be equivalent to{{hsp}}<ref>Fresnel, 1866, p.{{hsp}}757.</ref><ref>Hecht, 2002, p.{{hsp}}115, eq.{{hsp}}(4.43).</ref>\n\n:<math>r_\\text{p}=\\frac{\\tan(\\theta_\\text{i}-\\theta_\\text{t})}{\\tan(\\theta_\\text{i}+\\theta_\\text{t})}.\n</math><!-- DON'T BE THE NEXT PERSON WHO WRONGLY CHANGES THE SIGN OF THIS EXPRESSION JUST BECAUSE SOME TEXTBOOK USES A DIFFERENT CONVENTION FROM THE ONE USED ***CONSISTENTLY*** IN THIS ARTICLE! -->\n\nThese formulas{{hsp}}<ref>E.

The interference, however, is seen only when the surfaces are at distances comparable to or smaller than the light's [[coherence length]], which for ordinary white light is few micrometers; it can be much larger for light from a [[laser]].\n\nAn example of interference between reflections is the [[iridescence|iridescent]] colours seen in a [[soap bubble]] or in thin oil films on water. Applications include [[Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer]]s, [[antireflection coating]]s, and [[optical filter]]s. A quantitative analysis of these effects is based on the Fresnel equations, but with additional calculations to account for interference.\n\nThe [[transfer-matrix method (optics)|transfer-matrix method]], or the recursive Rouard method{{hsp}}<ref>{{cite book |first=O.

More often one refers to the ''relative permittivity'' also known as the  [[dielectric constant]]  ''\u03f5''<sub>rel</sub> which, when multiplied by the [[permittivity of free space]] ''\u03f5''<sub>0</sub> yields the permittivity  ''\u03f5''.

While this clash of signs is a disadvantage of the convention, the attendant advantage is that the signs agree at ''grazing'' incidence.\n\n=== Power ratios (reflectivity and transmissivity) ===\n\nThe ''[[Poynting vector]]'' for a plane wave is a vector whose component in any direction is the ''[[irradiance]]'' (power per unit area) of that wave on a surface perpendicular to that direction. The Poynting vector is{{px2}} {{math|{{sfrac|2}}{{px2}}Re{'''E'''{{tsp}}\u00d7{{tsp}}'''H<sup>\u2217</sup>'''}}} where '''E''' and '''H''' are due ''only'' to the wave in question. Inside a lossless dielectric (the usual case) '''E''' and '''H''' are in phase and at right angles,  and at right angles to the wave vector '''k''', so for s polarization, using the Z and X-Y components of '''E''' and '''H'''  respectively (or the X-Y and -Z components of '''E''' and '''H''' for p polarization) the [[irradiance]] in the direction of '''k''' is just given by {{math|''EH''/2}} or {{math|''E''<sup>2</sup>/''2Z''}} in a medium of characteristic impedance Z=1/Y. To compute the irradiance in the direction normal to the interface, as we shall require in the definition of the power transmission coefficient, one could use only the X component (rather than the full X-Y component) of H or E; or equivalently just multiply {{math|''EH''/2}} by the proper geometric factor, obtaining {{math|(''E''<sup>2</sup>/''2Z''){{tsp}}cos{{tsp}}''\u03b8''{{px2}},}}.\n\nFrom equations ({{EquationNote|13}}) and ({{EquationNote|21}}), taking squared magnitudes, we find that the ''[[reflectivity]]'' (ratio of reflected power to incident power) is\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>R_\\text{s}=\\left|\\frac{Y_1\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}-Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}}{Y_1\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}+Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}}\\right|^2</math>|{{EquationRef|25}}}}\nfor the s polarization, and\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>R_\\text{p}=\\left|\\frac{Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}-Y_1\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}}{Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}+Y_1\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}}\\right|^2</math>|{{EquationRef|26}}}}\nfor the p polarization. Note that when comparing the powers of two such waves in the same medium and with the same {{tsp}}cos{{tsp}}''\u03b8''{{px2}}, the impedance and geometric factors mentioned above are identical and cancel out. They are thus not taken into account, as they must be in computing the power transmission, below.\n\nThe simplest way to obtain the power transmission coefficient (or ''[[transmittance|transmissivity]]'' , ratio of transmitted power to incident power ''in the direction normal to the interface, Y'') is to simply use R+T=1 due to conservation of energy. We find for the two polarization cases:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>T_\\text{s}\n=1-R_\\text{s} =\n=\\frac{4 Re( Y_1 Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}\\cos\\theta_\\text{t})}{\\left|Y_1\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}+Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}\\right|^2}</math>|{{EquationRef|27}}}}\nfor the s polarization, and\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>T_\\text{p}\n=1-R_\\text{p} =\n=\\frac{4Re(Y_1 Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}\\cos\\theta_\\text{t})}{\\left|Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}+Y_1\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}\\right|^2}</math>|{{EquationRef|28}}}}\nfor the p polarization.\n\nIn the case of an interface between two lossless media (real \u03b5 and \u03bc >0) one can obtain these results directly using the squared magnitude of the amplitude transmission  coefficients we found earlier in  equations ({{EquationNote|14}}) and ({{EquationNote|22}}). Then, as noted above, to find the Poynting vector in the Y direction, each power must be multiplied by the geometric factor  {{math|cos{{tsp}}''\u03b8''{{px2}}}} and divided by the wave impedance Z. Applying these corrections to each wave we obtain two ratios multiplying the square of the amplitude transmission coefficient:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>T_\\text{s}\n=\\left(\\frac{2Y_1\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}}{Y_1\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}+Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}}\\right)^2\\frac{\\,Y_2\\,}{Y_1}\\,\\frac{\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}}{\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}}\n=\\frac{4Y_1 Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}}{\\left(Y_1\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}+Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}\\right)^2}</math>|{{EquationRef|27}}}}\nfor the s polarization, and\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>T_\\text{p}\n=\\left(\\frac{2Y_1\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}}{Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}+Y_1\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}}\\right)^2\\frac{\\,Y_2\\,}{Y_1}\\,\\frac{\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}}{\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}}\n=\\frac{4Y_1 Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}}{\\left(Y_2\\cos\\theta_\\text{i}+Y_1\\cos\\theta_\\text{t}\\right)^2}</math>|{{EquationRef|28}}}}\nfor the p polarization. In addition to only applying to lossless dielectrics, the latter equations are valid only at incidence angles smaller than the critical angle (beyond which T=0 of course!).\n\n=== Equal refractive indices ===\n\nFrom equations ({{EquationNote|4}}) and ({{EquationNote|5}}), we see that two dissimilar media will have the same refractive index, but different admittances, if the ratio of their permeabilities is the inverse of the ratio of their permittivities. It that unusual situation we have{{tsp}} {{math|''\u03b8''<sub>t</sub>{{tsp}}{{=}} ''\u03b8''<sub>i</sub>}}{{px2}} (that is, the transmitted ray is undeviated), so that the cosines in equations ({{EquationNote|13}}), ({{EquationNote|14}}), ({{EquationNote|21}}), ({{EquationNote|22}}), and ({{EquationNote|25}}) to ({{EquationNote|28}}) cancel out, and all the reflection and transmission ratios become independent of the angle of incidence; in other words, the ratios for normal incidence become applicable to all angles of incidence.\n\n=== Non-magnetic media ===\n\nSince the Fresnel equations were developed for optics, they are usually given for non-magnetic materials.

From equations ({{EquationNote|4}}) and ({{EquationNote|5}}), we see that if ''\u03f5'' is fixed instead of ''\u03bc'', then {{math|''n''}} becomes proportional to {{math|''Z''}}, not to {{math|''Y''}}. Hence, if all the reflection and transmission ratios are expressed in terms of refractive indices, the subscripts will match the impedance forms rather than the admittance forms; that is, the subscripts 1 and 2 in equations ({{EquationNote|29}}) to ({{EquationNote|38}}) will be interchanged. Hence, in ({{EquationNote|29}}) and ({{EquationNote|33}}), the expressions for {{math|''r''<sub>s</sub>}} and {{math|''r''<sub>p</sub>}} in terms of refractive indices will be interchanged, so that Brewster's angle ({{EquationNote|39}}) will give{{tsp}} {{math|''r''<sub>s</sub>{{tsp}}{{=}} 0}}{{tsp}} instead of{{tsp}} {{math|''r''<sub>p</sub>{{tsp}}{{=}} 0{{px2}},}}{{px2}} and any beam reflected at that angle will be p-polarized instead of s-polarized.<ref>More general Brewster angles, for which the angles of incidence and refraction are not necessarily complementary, are discussed in C.L.&nbsp;Giles and W.J.&nbsp;Wild, [http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/pubs/brewster-magnetic.pdf \"Brewster angles for magnetic media\"], ''International Journal of Infrared and Millimeter Waves'', vol.{{tsp}}6, no.{{px2}}3 (March 1985), pp.{{tsp}}187\u201397.</ref> Similarly, Fresnel's sine law will apply to the p polarization instead of the s polarization, and his tangent law to the s polarization instead of the p polarization.\n\nThis switch of polarizations has an analog in the old mechanical theory of light waves. One could predict reflection coefficients that agreed with observation by supposing (like Fresnel) that different refractive indices were due to different ''densities'' and that the vibrations were ''normal'' to what was then called the [[plane of polarization]], or by supposing (like [[James MacCullagh|MacCullagh]] and [[Franz Ernst Neumann|Neumann]]) that different refractive indices were due to different ''elasticities'' and that the vibrations were ''parallel'' to that plane.<ref>Whittaker, 1910, pp.{{tsp}}133,{{tsp}}148\u20139; Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}212,{{tsp}}229\u201331.</ref> Thus the condition of equal permittivities and unequal permeabilities, although not seen in practice, is of some historical interest.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Polarization mixing]]\n*[[Index-matching material]]\n*[[Field and power quantities]]\n*[[Fresnel rhomb]], Fresnel's apparatus to produce circularly polarised light [http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Polarized_Light/Fresnels_Rhomb/Fresnels_Rhomb.html]\n*[[Specular reflection]]\n*[[Schlick's approximation]]\n*[[Snell's window]]\n*[[X-ray reflectivity]]\n*[[Plane of incidence]]\n*[[Reflections of signals on conducting lines]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}<br/>\n* M.

It was the first winter sport included in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], in [[Figure skating at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908]].<ref name=AFS2014/> The four Olympic disciplines are [[Single skating|men's singles, ladies' singles]], [[pair skating]], and [[ice dance]]. Non-Olympic disciplines include [[synchronized skating]], [[Ice theatre|Theater on Ice]], and [[four skating]]. From novice through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs ([[Short program (figure skating)|short]] and [[Free skating|free skating]]) which, depending on the discipline, may include [[figure skating spins|spins]], [[figure skating jumps|jumps]], [[moves in the field]], [[Figure skating lifts|lifts]], [[Figure skating jumps#Throw jumps|throw jumps]], [[death spiral (figure skating)|death spiral]]s, and other elements or moves.\n\nThe blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct [[Glossary of figure skating terms|edges]]: inside and outside. Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time, which is referred to as a flat edge. During a spin, skaters use the \"sweet spot\" of the blade, formally called a rocker, which is the roundest portion of the blade, just behind the pick and near the middle of the blade. Skates used in single and pair skating have a set of large, jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade. Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps. Ice dance blades are an inch shorter in the rear and have smaller toe picks.\n\nFigure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level (senior) at local, regional, national, and international competitions. The [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) regulates international figure skating judging and competitions. These include the [[Figure skating at the Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]], the [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]], the [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championships]], the [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]], the [[Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|Four Continents Championships]], the Grand Prix series ([[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|senior]] and [[ISU Junior Grand Prix|junior]]), and the [[ISU Challenger Series]].\n\nThe sport is also associated with show business. Major competitions generally conclude with exhibition galas, in which the top skaters from each discipline perform non-competitive programs. Many skaters, both during and after their competitive careers, also skate in ice shows which run during the competitive season and the off-season.\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:NSAPINY9 EXTR.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|An 1862 lithograph depicting skating in the 19th century]]\nThe term \"professional\" in skating refers not to skill level but competitive status. Figure skaters competing at the highest levels of international competition are not \"professional\" skaters. They are sometimes referred to as amateurs,<ref name=USAT110315/> though some earn money. Professional skaters include those who have lost their ISU eligibility and those who perform only in shows. They may include former Olympic and World champions who have ended their competitive career as well as skaters with little or no international competitive experience.\n\nIn languages other than English, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Italian, Polish and Russian, figure skating is usually referred to by a name that translates as \"artistic skating.\"\n\n== Figure skates ==\n{{Main article|Figure skate}}\n[[File:Figure-skates-2.jpg|thumb|Close-up of a figure skating blade, showing the ''toe picks'', the ''hollow'' (groove) on bottom surface of blade, and screw attachment to the boot]]\n\nThe most visible difference in relation to [[ice hockey]] skates is that figure skates have a set of large, jagged teeth called ''toe picks'' on the front part of the blade. These are used primarily in jumping and should not be used for stroking or spins. If used during a spin, the toe pick will cause the skater to lose momentum, or move away from the center of the spin. Blades are mounted to the sole and heel of the boot with screws. Typically, high-level figure skaters are professionally fitted for their boots and blades at a reputable skate shop. Professionals are also employed to sharpen blades to individual requirements.<ref name=NYT090622/>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-79630-0003, Bodo Bockenauer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Blade sharpening]]\nBlades are about 3/16&nbsp;inch ({{nowrap|4.7 mm}}) thick. When viewed from the side, the blade of a figure skate is not flat, but curved slightly, forming an arc of a circle with a [[radius]] of {{nowrap|180\u2013220 cm}}. This curvature is referred to as the ''rocker'' of the blade. The \"sweet spot\" is the part of the blade on which all spins are rotated; this is usually located near the [[stanchion]] of the blade, below the ball of the foot.<ref name=fsequip/> The blade is also \"hollow ground\"; a groove on the bottom of the blade creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The '''inside edge''' of the blade is on the side closest to the skater; the '''outside edge''' of the blade is on the side farthest from the skater. In figure skating, it is always desirable to skate on only one edge of the blade. Skating on both at the same time (which is referred to as a ''flat'') may result in lower skating skills scores. The apparently effortless power and glide across the ice exhibited by elite figure skaters fundamentally derives from [[Conservation of angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|efficient use of the edges to generate speed]].\n\nIce dancers' blades are about an inch shorter in the rear than those used by skaters in other disciplines, to accommodate the intricate footwork and close partnering in dance. Dancers' blades also have a smaller toe pick as they do not require the large toe pick used for jumping in the other disciplines. Hard plastic ''skate guards'' are used when the skater must walk in his or her skates when not on the ice, to protect the blade from dirt or material on the ground that may dull the blade. Soft blade covers called ''soakers'' are used to absorb condensation and protect the blades from rust when the skates are not being worn. In competition, skaters are allowed three minutes to make repairs to their skates.\n\nOff-ice training is the term for physical conditioning that takes place off the ice. Besides regular physical exercise, skaters do walk-throughs of jumps off the ice in order to practise sufficient rotation and height of their jumps, and to practise consistency in landing on one foot.\n\n== Ice rinks and rink equipment ==\n{{Main article|Figure skating rink}}\nThere is significant variation in the dimensions of ice rinks. Olympic-sized rinks have dimensions of {{convert|30|x|60|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}, [[National Hockey League|NHL]]-sized rinks are {{convert|26|x|61|m|abbr=on}}, while European rinks are sometimes {{convert|30|x|64|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=aboutrinks/> The [[International Skating Union|ISU]] prefers Olympic-sized rinks for figure skating competitions, particularly for major events. According to ISU rule 342, a figure skating rink for an ISU event \"if possible, shall measure sixty (60) meters in one direction and thirty (30) meters in the other, but not larger, and not less than fifty-six (56) meters in one direction and twenty-six (26) meters in the other.\"<ref name=isuSFTR/> The scoring system rewards skaters who have good ice coverage, i.e. those who efficiently cover the entire ice surface during their programs. Olympic-sized rinks make the differences in skill between skaters more apparent but they are not available for all events. If a rink has different dimensions, a skater's jump setup and speed may be hindered as he or she adjusts.<ref name=AP111022/><ref name=IN131007/>\n\nIce quality is judged by smoothness, friction, hardness, and brittleness.<ref name=WMQI1105/> Factors affecting ice quality include temperature, water quality, and usage, with toe picks causing more deterioration. For figure skating, the ice surface temperature is normally maintained between {{convert|-5.5|C|F}} and {{convert|-3.5|C|F}},<ref name=WMQI1105/><ref name=\"Olympic.org161031\"/> with the Olympic disciplines requiring slightly softer ice (\u22123.5 \u00b0C) than synchronized skating (\u22125.5 \u00b0C).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usfsa.org/content/ISU%20SYS%20Handbook%20for%20Referees.pdf|title=Handbook for Referees \u2212 Synchronized Skating \u2212 Season 2017\u22122018|page=42|date=August 14, 2017|publisher=[[International Skating Union]]|access-date=July 23, 2018}}</ref> Typically after every two warm-up groups, an [[ice resurfacer]] cleans and smooths the surface of the ice sheet. Inadequate ice quality may affect skaters' performances.<ref name=GS120328ps/>\n\nSome rinks have a harness system installed to help skaters learn new jumps in a controlled manner. A heavy-duty cable is securely attached to two of the walls around the ice, with a set of pulleys riding on the cable. The skater wears a vest or belt, with a cable or rope attached to it, and the cable/rope is threaded through the movable pulley on the cable above. The coach holds the other end of the cable and lifts the skater by pulling the cable/rope. The skater can then practise the jump with the coach assisting the completion.\n\n== Disciplines ==\n\n=== Olympic disciplines ===\nAs an Olympic sport, figure skating comprises the following disciplines:<ref name=olympic>[http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/disciplines_uk.asp?DiscCode=FS Figure skating at Olympic.org], accessed September 4, 2006.</ref>\n\n* '''[[Single skating|Singles]]''' competition for men and women (referred to as \"ladies\" in ISU rulebooks), wherein individual skaters perform [[figure skating jump|jumps]], [[figure skating spin|spins]], [[step sequence]]s, [[Figure skating spirals|spirals]], and other elements in their programs.\n*'''[[Pair skating]]''' teams, consisting of a man and a woman skating together. Pairs perform elements that are specific to the discipline such as: [[Figure skating jumps#Jumps in pair skating|throw jumps]], in which the man 'throws' the woman into a jump; [[Figure skating lifts#Pair lifts|lifts]], in which the woman is held above the man's head in one of various grips and positions; [[Figure skating spins#Pair skating and ice dancing|pair spins]], in which both skaters spin together about a common axis; [[Death spiral (figure skating)|death spiral]]s; and other elements such as side-by-side jumps and spins in unison.\n*'''[[Ice dance]]''' is again for couples consisting of a woman and a man skating together. In contrast to pair skating, ice dance focuses on intricate footwork performed in close dance holds, in time with the music. [[Figure skating lifts#Dance lifts|Ice dance lifts]] must not go above the shoulder, and throws and jumps are disallowed.\n\nThe four disciplines of men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating and ice dance also appeared as part of a [[Figure skating at the 2014 Winter Olympics \u2013 Team trophy|team event]] for the first time at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].<ref name=reu110406/>\n\n=== Other disciplines ===\n[[File:Marigold IceUnity.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Synchronized skating]]\n[[File:Haydenettes2013-01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Lifts performed by the Haydenettes, 21-time U.S. national champions]]\n*'''[[Synchronized skating]]''' (formerly known as \"precision skating\") is for mixed-gender groups of 12 to 20 skaters. This discipline resembles a group form of ice dance with additional emphasis on precise formations of the group as a whole and complex transitions between formations. The basic formations include wheels, blocks, lines, circles, and intersections. The close formations and need for the team to stay in unison add to the difficulty of the footwork performed by the skaters in these elements. A formal proposal for inclusion in the Olympics was submitted by the [[International Skating Union|ISU]] to the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in September 2014.<ref name=CT140929/>\n*'''[[Ice theatre|Theatre on Ice]]''', also known as \"Ballet on Ice\" in Europe. This is a form of group skating that is less structured than synchronized skating and allows the use of props and theatrical costuming.\n*'''[[Four skating]]''', a discipline in which a team of four skaters, consisting of two men and two women, perform singles and pairs elements in unison, as well as unique elements that involve all four skaters.\n*'''[[Special figures]]''' is the tracing of elaborate original designs on the ice. It was a common discipline in the early days of skating and appeared once at the Olympics, in [[Figure skating at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908]].\n*'''Adagio skating''', a form of pair skating most commonly seen in ice shows, where the skaters perform many acrobatic lifts but few or none of the other elements which competitive pairs must perform.\n*'''Acrobatic skating''', also known as \"Acrobatics on ice\" or \"Extreme Skating\", is a combination of circus arts, technical artistic gymnastics skills, and figure skating.\n\n== Elements and moves ==\n{{Main article|Glossary of figure skating terms}}\n\nEach element receives a score according to its base value and grade of execution (GOE), resulting in a combined technical elements score (TES). At competitions, a technical specialist identifies the elements and assigns each one a level of difficulty, ranging from B (Basic) to Level 4 (most difficult).<ref name=isu2168/> For each element, a panel of judges determines the GOE, ranging between \u20135 and +5, according to how well the skater executes the element. The GOE is weighted according to the base value of the element.<ref name=isu2168/>\n\nThe ISU defines a fall as a loss of control with the result that the majority of the skater's body weight is not on the blade but supported by hands, knees, or buttocks.<ref name=deduc/>\n\n=== Jumps ===\n{{Main article|Figure skating jumps}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=right\n|-\n! colspan=2 | ISU abbreviations:<br />[[Figure skating jumps|Jumps]]\n|-\n! T || [[Toe loop jump|Toe loop]]\n|-\n! S || [[Salchow jump|Salchow]]\n|-\n! Lo || [[Loop jump|Loop]]\n|-\n! F || [[Flip jump|Flip]]\n|-\n! Lz || [[Lutz jump|Lutz]]\n|-\n! A || [[Axel jump|Axel]]\n|}\n\n[[File:Figure Skating.webmhd.webm|thumb|Video demonstrating figure skating jumps]]\nJumps involve the skater leaping into the air and rotating rapidly to land after completing one or more rotations. There are many types of jumps, identified by the way the skater takes off and lands, as well as by the number of rotations that are completed.\n\nEach jump receives a score according to its base value and grade of execution (GOE).<ref name=isu2168/> Quality of execution, technique, height, speed, flow and ice coverage are considered by the judges. An ''under-rotated'' jump (indicated by < ) is \"missing rotation of more than \u00bc, but less than \u00bd revolution\" and receives 70% of the base value. A ''downgraded'' jump (indicated by <<) is \"missing rotation of \u00bd revolution or more\". A downgraded triple is treated as a double jump, while a downgraded double is treated as a single jump.\n\nAn edge violation occurs when a skater executes a jump on the incorrect edge. The hollow is a groove on the bottom of the blade which creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The inside edge of the blade is on the side closest to the skater, the outside edge is on the side farthest from the skater, and a ''flat'' refers to skating on both edges at the same time, which is discouraged. An unclear edge or edge violation is indicated with an 'e' and reflected in the GOE according to the severity of the problem. ''Flutz'' and ''lip'' are the colloquial terms for a Lutz and flip jump with an edge violation.\n\nIn 1982, the [[International Skating Union|ISU]] enacted a rule stating that a skater may perform each type of triple only once in a program, or twice if one of them is incorporated into a combination or sequence. For a set of jumps to be considered a ''combination'', each jump must take off from the landing edge of the previous jump, with no steps, turns, or change of edge in between jumps. Toe loops and loops are commonly performed as the second or third jump in a combination because they take off from the back outside edge of the landing foot, or skating [[leg]]. To perform a salchow or flip on the back end of a combination, a half loop (which is actually a full rotation, but lands on a back inside edge of the landing leg) may be used as a connecting jump. In contrast, jump ''sequences'' are sets of jumps which may be linked by non-listed jumps or hops.<ref name=tphss/> Sequences are worth 80% of the combined value of the same jumps executed in combination.\n\nA figure skater only needs to be able to jump in one direction, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. The vast majority of figure skaters prefer to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction when jumping. Thus, for clarity, all jumps will be described for a skater jumping counter-clockwise.\n\nThere are six jumps in figure skating that count as jump elements. All six are landed on one foot on the back [[figure skate#Blades|outside edge]] (with counter-clockwise rotation, for single and multi-revolution jumps), but have different takeoffs, by which they may be distinguished. The two categories of jumps are toe jumps and edge jumps.\n\nThe number of rotations performed in the air determines whether the jump is a single, double, triple, or quadruple (commonly known as a \"[[Quad (figure skating)|quad]]\"). The simplest jump begins with a waltz jump which can only be done in a half-leap and is not classified as a single, double, or triple jump. Senior-level male single skaters perform mostly triple and quadruple jumps in competition. Triple jumps other than the Axel are commonly performed by female single skaters. It is extremely rare for a female skater to land a quadruple jump; the only two female single skaters to be credited with quads in competition are [[Miki Ando]], who landed the first quad Salchow [[2002\u201303 ISU Junior Grand Prix|in Dec 2002]], and [[Alexandra Trusova]], who landed the first quad Toe Loop (and only the second quad Salchow) [[2018 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|in March 2018]], both at the Junior level. Alexandra Trusova also was the first female to ever land 2 quadruple jumps in competition, the quad salchow and the quad toe loop. She was only 13 years old at the time.\n\nSome elite skaters can complete a jump in about one second, with 26 inches of height and 10 feet in distance.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The takeoff speed of a jump can reach up to 15&nbsp;mph.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==== Toe jumps ====\nToe jumps are launched by digging the toe pick of one skate into the ice, using it to vault into the air with the opposite leg. The main toe jumps are (in order of score value):<ref>{{cite web|title=Holland Ice Academy|url=http://hollandiceacademy.com/en/jumps}}</ref>\n# [[Toe loop jump|Toe loop]] \u2013 the skater takes off backwards from the outside edge of the right (or left) foot, launching the jump using the opposite toe pick.\n# [[Flip jump|Flip]] (sometimes known as a Toe Salchow) \u2013 the skater takes off backwards from the inside edge of the left (or right) foot and assists the take-off using the opposite toe pick.\n# [[Lutz jump|Lutz]] \u2013 similar to the flip, but the skater takes off from the backward ''outside'' edge of the left (or right) foot, launching the jump using the opposite toe pick.\n\nAll of the above descriptions assume a counter-clockwise direction of rotation, landing backwards on the outside edge of the right foot. (For clockwise rotation, the skater takes off using the alternative foot and lands backwards on the outside edge of the left foot.)\n\n==== Edge jumps ====\n[[File:Axel Paulsen jump without text.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An axel jump]]\nEdge jumps use no toe assist, and include (in order of score value):\n# [[Salchow jump|Salchow]] \u2013 the skater takes off backwards from the inside edge of the left (or right) foot, allowing the edge to come round, the opposite leg helps to launch the jump into the air.\n# [[Loop jump|Loop]] (also known as a Rittberger jump) \u2013 the skater takes off backwards from the outside edge of the right (or left) foot.\n# [[Axel jump|Axel]] \u2013 the skater takes off forwards from the outside edge of the left (or right) foot. As this is the only rotating jump to take off from a forward edge, it includes an extra half rotation.\n\nAgain, these descriptions assume a counter-clockwise direction of rotation, landing backwards on the outside edge of the right foot. (For clockwise rotation, the skater takes off using the alternative foot and always lands backwards on the outside edge of the left foot.)\n\n==== Other jumps ====\nThere are also a number of other jumps that are usually performed only as single jumps and in elite skating are used as transitional movements or highlights in step sequences. These include the half toe loop (ballet jump), half loop, half flip, [[walley jump]], [[waltz jump]], inside Axel, one-foot Axel, and [[split jump]]. There are two kinds of split jump:\n* Russian split, performed in a position that is similar to that of a straddle split\n* ladies split, performed in the position of the more traditional split, facing the direction of the front leg\n\n<gallery>\nFile:2011 WFSC 4d 066 Ross Miner.JPG|[[Ross Miner]] sets up for a jump.\nFile:2011 WFSC 3d 009 Denis Ten.JPG|[[Denis Ten]] sets up for a jump.\nFile:2011 WFSC 3d 183 Kevin van der Perren.JPG|[[Kevin van der Perren]] rotates in the air.\nFile:Jamal Othman Jump 2 - 2006 Skate Canada.jpg|[[Jamal Othman]] lands on the right back outside edge.\n</gallery>\n<br>\n<gallery>\nFile:Marissa Castelli & Simon Shnapir 2LoTh 2009 Junior Worlds.jpg|Pairs skaters [[Marissa Castelli]] and [[Simon Shnapir]] set up for a throw jump\nFile:Jessica Miller & Ian Moram Throw Jump - 2006 Skate Canada.jpg|A pair team after the woman has been thrown: Jessica Miller rotates in the air.\nFile:Anabelle Langlois & Cody Hay Throw Jump - 2006 Skate America.jpg|[[Anabelle Langlois]] lands after performing a throw jump with [[Cody Hay]].\n</gallery>\n\n=== Spins ===\n{{Main article|Figure skating spins}}\n\nSpins are a required element in all four Olympic disciplines. There are three basic positions \u2013 upright, sit and camel \u2013 with numerous variations.\n\n* '''Upright spin''' variations include layback, Biellmann, haircutter, layover layback, attitude, and pearl.\n* '''Sit spin''' variations include pancake, broken leg, tuck behind, cannonball, flying, and clam.\n* '''Camel spin''' variations include catch-foot, layover, flying, and donut.\n\nSpins may be performed individually or in a spin sequence, combining different types of spin; a spin sequence is known as a \"combination spin\". During a spin, the skater rotates on the front rocker (sometimes called the \"sweet spot\" or \"spin rocker\"), which is the curved part of the blade that corresponds to the ball of the skater's foot, just behind the toe pick. A spin may be executed on the back rocker of the blade during a change of edge spin. For example, a back scratch spin will flip edges to a forward inside edge. This feature of a spin will change the level of a spin.\n\nA figure skater only needs to be able to spin in one direction, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Most skaters favor a counter-clockwise direction of rotation when spinning (as in jumping), but there are some skaters who prefer to spin in the clockwise direction. A small minority of skaters are able to spin in both directions. Spins may be performed on either foot. For skaters who rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, a spin on the left foot is called a forward spin, while a spin on the right foot is called a back spin. The opposite applies for skaters who rotate in a clockwise direction. When learning to spin, a skater will typically learn a forward spin first, then once that is mastered they will learn how to execute a back spin.\n\nWhen performing some types of spin, an elite skater can complete on average six rotations per second, and up to 70 rotations in a single spin.<ref>''Frozen Teardrop: The Tragedy and Triumph of Figure Skating's \"Queen of Spin\"'' {{ISBN|978-1-590-79213-1}} p. 243</ref> However, this is rarely seen in modern competitions because it would gain no extra points for the spin.\n\nSpins are normally entered on the ice, but they can also be entered from a jump or sequence of jumps known as star jumps. Spins that are entered through a jump are calling flying spins; these include the flying camel, flying sit spin, death drop, and butterfly spin. Flying spins may go from a forward spin to a back spin and they can also be performed as part of a spin sequence (combination spin).\n\nIn pair skating, spins may be performed side-by-side with both partners doing the same spin or combination spin simultaneously. Additionally, in pairs and in ice dance, there are pair spins and dance spins, during which both skaters rotate around the same axis while holding onto one another.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Yukina Ota 2003 NHK Trophy 2.jpg|Camel spin\nFile:2011 Figure Skating WC Tom\u00e1\u0161 Verner (4).jpg|Sit spin\nFile:Elena Sokolova 04 NHK 2.jpg|Upright spin\nFile:Dominika Piatkowska & Dmitri Khromin Spin - 2006 Skate America.jpg|Pair camel spin\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-U1215-0046, Sabine Bae\u00df, Tassilo Thierbach.jpg|Pair spin with lady in layback and man in sit spin\nFile:2012 WFSC 07d 843 Polina Korobeynikova.JPG|Layback spin with catch-foot\nFile:2011 Cup of China Yuzuru Hanyu.jpg|Biellmann spin\nFile:Joubert 09Eurosp by Carmichael.jpg|Death drop\n</gallery>\n\n=== Lifts ===\n{{Main article|Figure skating lifts}}\n[[File:Maria Mukhortova and Maxim Trankov at 2010 European Championships (3).jpg|right|thumb|A one arm overhead lift in pair skating]]\nLifts are a required element in [[pair skating]] and [[ice dance]].\n\n==== Pair lifts ====\nPair lifts are generally overhead. According to the current ISU rules for senior-level competition, the man must rotate more than once, but fewer than three-and-a-half times. In competitive pair skating, lifts must travel across the ice to be included in the technical elements score (TES); stationary lifts are included in choreography. Pair lifts are grouped by the holds involved.\n\nLegal holds:\n* ''Armpit holds'' are not generally used in elite senior competition.\n* ''Waist holds''\n* ''Hand-to-hip holds''\n* ''Hand-to-hand'' lifts are divided into two types: \n**''Press'' lifts \n**''Lasso'' lifts, in order of increasing difficulty:<ref name=isu2168/>\n*** Toe or step in lasso\n*** Axel or backward lasso\n*** Reverse lasso\n\nThe judges look at speed, ice coverage, the quality of the lady's position, position changes, and the man's stability and cleanness of turns throughout. Skaters may also raise their score by having a difficult entry such as in spiral or spread eagle position, a difficult exit, or other features such as stopping the rotation, turning a carry lift into rotational one, or reversing rotation (i.e. both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions). This gives the lifts a level. They can be from a base level to a level 4. The higher the level, the more points the skaters can receive. \n\n'''Twist lifts''' are a form of pair lifts, where the lifted partner is thrown into the air, twists, and is caught by the lifted partner. The lady is caught by her waist in the air and lands on the backward outside edge. Some pairs include a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is separated by at least a 45\u00b0 angle from the body axis and the legs are straight or almost straight. Scores are also affected by the height of the twist, turns, steps or other moves before the element, the lady holding her arms over her head, delayed rotation, etc. This element is also a leveled element. \n\n==== Dance lifts ====\nIce dancers are not allowed to lift their partners above their shoulders. Dance lifts are separated into ''short lifts'' and ''long lifts''. There are many positions each partner can take to raise the difficulty of a lift. Each position must be held for at least three seconds to count and is permitted only once in a program.\n\n'''Short lifts''' may last up to six seconds in competition on the senior level.\n*''Stationary lift'' \u2013 A lift performed \"on the spot\". The lifting partner does not move across the ice, but is allowed to rotate.\n*''Straight line lift'' \u2013 The lifting partner moves in a straight line across the ice. This lift may be performed on one foot or two.\n*''Curve lift'' \u2013 The lifting partner moves along a curve across the ice. This lift may be performed on one foot or two.\n*''Rotational lift'' \u2013 The lifting partner rotates in one direction while traveling across the ice.\n\n'''Long lifts''' may last up to ten seconds in competition on the senior level.\n*''Reverse rotational lift'' \u2013 The lifting partner rotates in one direction, then switches and rotates in the other direction, while traveling across the ice.\n*''Serpentine lift'' \u2013 The lifting partner moves in a serpentine pattern across the ice. \n*''Combination lift'' \u2013 A lift combining two of the four short lifts. Each part of the lift must be fully established.\n\nIn both pairs and dance, lifts that go on longer than allowed receive deductions.\n\n=== Turns, steps, moves in the field, and other moves ===\nStep sequences are a required element in all four Olympic disciplines. The pattern can be straight line, circular, or serpentine. The step sequence consists of a combination of turns, steps, hops and edge changes. Additionally, steps and turns can be used as transitions between elements. The various turns, which skaters can incorporate into step sequences, include:\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Threeturn.GIF | [[3 turn|Three turns]], so called because the blade turns into the curve of the edge or lobe to leave a tracing resembling the numeral \"3\".\nFile:Bracket.GIF | [[Bracket turn]]s, in which the blade is turned counter to the curve of the lobe, making a tracing resembling a bracket (\"}\").\nFile:Mohawk-trace.png | [[Mohawk turn|Mohawk]]s, the two-foot equivalents of three turns and brackets.\nFile:Rocker turn.gif | [[Rocker turn|Rockers]], one-foot turns that involve a change of lobe as well as of direction.\nFile:Counter.GIF | [[Counter turn|Counters]], one-foot turns that involve a change of lobe as well as of direction.\nFile:2011 WFSC 2d 259 Siobhan Heekin-Canedy Alexander Shakalov.JPG | [[Twizzle]]s, traveling multi-rotation turns on one foot\n</gallery>\n\n[[Choctaw turn|Choctaw]]s are the two-foot equivalents of rockers and counters. Other movements that may be incorporated into step sequences or used as connecting elements include lunges and [[spread eagle (figure skating)|spread eagles]]. An [[Ina Bauer (element)|Ina Bauer]] is similar to a spread eagle performed with one knee bent and typically an arched back. [[Hydroblading]] refers to a deep edge performed with the body as low as possible to the ice in a near-horizontal position.\n\n[[Moves in the field]] emphasize basic skating skill and edge control. In the context of a competitive program, they include [[spiral (figure skating)|spirals]], [[spread eagle (figure skating)|spread eagles]], [[Ina Bauer (element)|Ina Bauers]], [[hydroblading]], and similar extended edge moves.\n\nA spiral is an element in which the skater moves across the ice on a specific edge with the free leg held at hip level or above. Spirals are distinguished by the edge of the blade used (inside or outside), the direction of motion (forward or backward), and the skater's position. A spiral sequence is one or more spiral positions and edges done in sequence. Judges look at the depth, stability, and control of the skating edge, speed and ice coverage, extension, and other factors. Some skaters are able to change edges during a spiral, i.e. from inside to outside edge. Spirals performed on a \"flat\" are generally not considered as true spirals. Spiral sequences are required in ladies' and pair skating.\n\nA [[Death spiral (figure skating)|death spiral]] is a required element of pair skating. There are four varieties distinguished by the lady's edge and direction of motion. The man performs a [[Glossary of figure skating terms#P|pivot]], one toe anchored in the ice, while holding the hand of his partner, who circles him on a deep edge with her body almost parallel to the ice. As of 2011, the woman's head must at some time reach her skating knee. The man must also be in a full pivot position and the death spiral must be held for a minimum amount of rotation, depending on the level.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Jenni Vahamaa 2008 Junior Worlds.jpg|A basic outside edge spiral position with the free leg held unsupported behind the body.\nFile:Maria Mukhortova & Maxim Trankov - 2006 Skate America.jpg|A pair outside edge spiral in a catch-foot position.\nFile:McLaughlin Brubaker Death Spiral.jpg|Back inside death spiral.\nFile:Kristina Gorshkova & Vitali Butikov 2005 Croatia Cup.jpg|Parallel mirror spread eagles with the male on an inside edge and the female on an outside edge.\nFile:Tugba Karademir Ina Bauer - 2006 Skate Canada.jpg|Ina Bauer\nFile:Anna Cappellini Luca LaNotte Skate Canada 2007.jpg|Ice dancers in lunge position\nFile:2011 WFSC 4d 002 Kim Lucine.JPG|Hydroblading\nFile:2012 Rostelecom Cup 02d 800 Tessa VIRTUE Scott MOIR.JPG|Male ice dancer in Besti squat while lifting partner\n</gallery>\n\n=== Compulsory figures ===\n[[Compulsory figures]] involves using blades to draw circles, figure 8s, and similar shapes in ice. Skaters are judged on the accuracy and clarity of the figures and the cleanness and exact placement of the various turns on the circles. Figures were formerly included as a component of singles competitions but were eliminated from international events in 1990.<ref name=CBS981216/> The [[United States]] was the last country to retain a separate test and competitive structure for compulsory figures, but the last national-level figures championship was held in 1999. Moves in the field (known in the [[United Kingdom]] as ''field moves'') replaced compulsory figures as a discipline to teach the same turns and edge skills. As of 2015, The World Figure Sport Society formed in Lake Placid, NY has hosted The World Figure Championships in 2015, 2016, and 2017, acting to preserve the historic origins of Figure Skating, and offering a perfect black ice surface on which the World Championships in figures is held.\n\n== Competition format and scoring ==\n[[File:2012 WFSC 06d 452 Maylin Hausch Daniel Wende.JPG|right|thumb|Pair performing crossovers]]\n[[File:Takahiko Kozuka with Nobuo Sato kiss & cry 2008-2009 GPF.jpg|right|thumb|[[Takahiko Kozuka]] waits for his marks with coach [[Nobuo Sato]] in the \"[[Kiss and cry]]\" area]]\n{{Main article|Figure skating competition}}\nThe [[International Skating Union|ISU]] is the governing body for international competitions in figure skating, including the World Championships and the figure skating events at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. Medals are awarded for overall results. The standard medal colors are gold for first place, silver for second, and bronze for third place. [[U.S. Figure Skating]] also awards pewter medals for fourth-place finishers in national events. At the World, European, Four Continents, and World Junior Championships, the ISU also awards ''small medals'' for segment results (short and free program). A medal is generally attributed to only one country, even if a partnership is composed of skaters of different nationalities. A notable exception are the 1910\u20131911 pair skating medals won by [[Ludowika Eilers]] and [[Walter Jakobsson]]; the medals are attributed to both Germany and Finland.<ref name=WCP>{{cite web |url= http://www.isu.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,4844-148238-165454-56217-0-file,00.pdf |title= World Figure Skating Championship: Pairs |publisher= International Skating Union |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131205021633/http://www.isu.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0%2C11040%2C4844-148238-165454-56217-0-file%2C00.pdf |archivedate= December 5, 2013 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}</ref> Beyond the early 20th century, no skaters have been allowed to represent two countries in the same competition.\n\nIn singles and pairs figure skating competition, competitors perform two programs \u2013 the [[Short program (figure skating)|short program]], in which they complete a list of required elements consisting of jumps, spins and steps; and the [[Free skating|free skate]], also known as the ''long program'', in which they have slightly more choice of elements. Under both the 6.0 system and the ISU Judging System, the judges consider the \"complete package\" when evaluating performances, i.e. The best jumper is not always placed first if the judges consider another skater's speed, spins, presentation, etc., to outweigh the difference in jumping execution.<ref name=nyt970216/><ref name=CBS981202/>\n\nIce dance competitions formerly consisted of three phases: one or more [[compulsory dance (ice dance)|compulsory dance]]s; an [[original dance]] to a [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] rhythm that was designated annually; and a [[Free dance (figure skating)|free dance]] to music of the skaters' own choice. Beginning in the [[2010\u20132011 figure skating season|2010\u201311 season]], the compulsory and original dances were merged into the [[short dance]].\n\n===6.0 System===\n{{Main article|6.0 system}}\nSkating was formerly judged for \"technical merit\" (in the free skate), \"required elements\" (in the short program), and \"presentation\" (in both programs).<ref name=CBS981202/> The marks for each program ran from 0.0 to 6.0, the latter being the highest. These marks were used to determine a preference ranking, or \"ordinal\", separately for each judge; the judges' preferences were then combined to determine placements for each skater in each program. The placements for the two programs were then combined, with the free skate placement weighted more heavily than the short program. The highest placing individual (based on the sum of the weighted placements) was declared the winner.<ref name=6.0>[http://www.usfigureskating.org/New_Judging.asp?id=314 The 6.0 System at usfigureskating.org], accessed September 4, 2006.</ref>\n\n===ISU Judging System===\n{{Main article|ISU Judging System}}\nIn 2004, in response to the [[2002 Olympic Winter Games figure skating scandal|judging controversy]] during the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], the ISU adopted the International Judging System (IJS), which became mandatory at all international competitions in 2006, including the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. The new system is sometimes informally referred to as the ''Code of Points'', however, the ISU has never used the term to describe their system in any of their official communications.\n\nUnder the IJS, points are awarded individually for each skating element, and the sum of these points is the ''total element score'' (TES). Competitive programs are constrained to include a set number of elements. Each element is judged first by a technical specialist who identifies the specific element and determines its ''base value''. This is done using instant replay video to verify features that distinguish different elements; e.g. the exact foot position at take-off and landing of a jump. A panel of twelve judges then each award a mark for the quality and execution of the element. This mark, called the ''grade of execution'' (GOE), is an integer with a minimum value of \u20135 and a maximum value of +5.<ref name=isu2168/> The GOE mark is then translated into another value by using the table of values in ISU rule 322. The GOE value from the twelve judges is then processed with a computerized random selection of nine judges, the highest and lowest values are then discarded, and finally the average of the remaining seven is calculated. This average value is then added to (or subtracted from) the base value to determine the total value for the element.<ref name=judging>[http://www.isu.org/vsite/vcontent/page/custom/0,8510,4844-152094-169310-31825-132302-custom-item,00.html ISU Judging System for Single & Pair Skating and Ice Dance 2004/5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211025052/http://www.isu.org/vsite/vcontent/page/custom/0,8510,4844-152094-169310-31825-132302-custom-item,00.html |date=December 11, 2013 }}, accessed September 4, 2006.</ref>\n\nNote: The IJS previously used a GOE scale of \u20133 to +3<ref name=\"isu2089\"/> but this was changed for the 2018\u20132019 season and is in the early stages of being tested in competitions.\n\nThe ''program components score'' (PCS) awards points to holistic aspects of a program or other nuances that are not rewarded in the ''total element score''. The components are:<ref name=components/>\n# Skating skills (SS) reward use of edges and turns, flow over the ice surface, speed and acceleration, ice coverage, clean and controlled curves, multi-directional skating, and mastery of one-foot skating (no overuse of skating on two feet). \n# Transitions (TR)\n# Performance/Execution (PE)\n# Choreography (CH)\n# Interpretation (IN)\nA detailed description of each component is given in ISU rule 322.2. Judges award each component a raw mark from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.25, with a mark of 5 being defined as \"average\". For each separate component, the raw marks are then selected, trimmed, and averaged in a manner akin to determining a ''grade of execution''. The trimmed mean scores are then translated into a factored mark by multiplying by a factor that depends on the discipline, competition segment, and level. Then the five (or four) factored marks are added to give the final PCS score.\n\nThe ''total element score'' and the ''program components score'' are added to give the total score for a competition segment (TSS). A skater's final placement is determined by the total of their scores in all segments of a competition. No ordinal rankings are used to determine the final results.\n\n===Other judging and competition===\nThere are also skating competitions organized for professional skaters by independent promoters. These competitions use judging rules set by whoever organizes the competition. There is no \"professional league\". Well-known professional competitions in the past have included the [[World Professional Figure Skating Championships|World Professional Championships]] (held in Landover, Maryland), the Challenge Of Champions, the Canadian Professional Championships and the [[World Professional Figure Skating Championships|World Professional Championships]] (held in Jaca, Spain).\n\nThe [[Ice Skating Institute]] (ISI), an international ice rink trade organization, runs its own competitive and test program aimed at recreational skaters. Originally headquartered in Minnesota, the organization now operates out of Dallas, Texas. ISI competitions are open to any member that have registered their tests. There are very few \"qualifying\" competitions, although some districts hold Gold Competitions for that season's first-place winners. ISI competitions are especially popular in Asian countries that do not have established ISU member federations. The [[Gay Games]] have also included skating competitions for same-gender pairs and dance couples under ISI sponsorship. Other figure skating competitions for adults also attract participants from diverse cultures.\n\n== World standings and season's bests ==\n\n=== World standings ===\n{{main|ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking}}\nThe '''world standing (WS)''' of a skater/couple is calculated based on the results over the current and preceding two seasons. Competitors receive points based on their final placement at an event and the event's weight.

A new partnership starts with zero points; there is no transfer of WS points if a pair or ice dance couple split up and form a new partnership.\n\nThese standings do not necessarily reflect the capabilities of the skater(s). Due to limits on entries to events (no more than three from each country), and varying numbers of high-level skaters in each country, skaters from some countries may find it more difficult to qualify to compete at major events. Thus, a skater with a lower SB but from a country with few high-level skaters may qualify to a major event while a skater with a much higher SB but from a country with more than three high-level skaters may not be sent. As a result, it is possible for a skater who regularly scores higher to end up with a much lower world standing.\n\nThe ''season's world ranking'' of a skater/couple is calculated similarly to the overall world standing but is based on the results of the ongoing season only.<ref name =isuws/>\n\n=== Season's bests ===\nThe '''season's best (SB)''' of a skater/couple is the highest score achieved within a particular season.

Only scores achieved at select international competitions are considered. Scores from national competitions and certain international events are excluded.\n\nThere are also personal best (PB) scores, i.e. the highest scores a skater or couple has achieved over their entire career, in terms of combined total and segment scores. However, PB scores are not completely comparable if achieved in different seasons because the ISU modifies requirements and rules between seasons. In different seasons, there may be different requirements to achieve a certain level or different elements may be required. New elements may become allowed (for example, two quads in the short program were permitted starting in the 2010\u201311 season). There may be a change in point values. For example, the values of quads were increased after the 2010 Olympics and a second step sequence in men is no longer assigned a level. As a result, the ISU now places more weight on SB.\n\n== Music and clothing ==\n[[File:2012 WFSC 04d 575 Tessa Virtue Scott Moir.JPG|thumb|right|An example of ice dance costumes]]\n\n=== Music ===\nFor competitive programs, figure skaters were once restricted to instrumental music; vocals were allowed only if they contained no lyrics or words.<ref name=vocalsnote/> Beginning in the 1997\u201398 season, the [[International Skating Union|ISU]] decided to allow lyrics or words in [[ice dance]] music. Although the rules were not relaxed for singles and pairs, judges did not always penalize violations. At the [[2011 World Figure Skating Championships|2011 World Championships]], [[Florent Amodio]]'s long program music included words but an insufficient number of judges voted for a deduction.<ref name=w11mlp/> In June 2012, the ISU voted to allow skaters from all disciplines to choose music with words in their competitive programs beginning in the [[2014\u201315 figure skating season|2014\u201315 season]].<ref name=NYT140218/><ref name=IN140716/>\n\nSkaters may use professional music editors so that their music meets requirements.<ref name=NDN140217/> Ice dancers are required to skate to music that has a definite beat or rhythm. Singles and pair skaters more often skate to the melody and phrasing of their music. For [[free skating|long program]]s, figure skaters generally search for music with different moods and tempos.<ref name=IN120423/> Music selections for exhibitions are less constrained than for competitive programs.\n\n=== Clothing ===\nSkaters are generally free to select their own attire, with a few restrictions. In competition, females may wear a dress, typically with matching attached briefs, and since 2004, they may also choose trousers.<ref name=ST041205/> They may wear opaque flesh-colored leggings or tights under dresses and skirts, which may extend to cover their skates. Men must wear trousers \u2013 they are not allowed to wear tights, although, officials do not always impose a deduction for violations.<ref name=GS121031/> Matching costumes are not required in pair skating and ice dance.<ref name=AS120818/>\n\nCompetition costumes vary widely, from simple designs to heavily beaded or trimmed costumes. Skaters risk a deduction if a piece of their costume falls onto the ice surface. An official may stop a program if he or she deems there to be a hazard. Skaters and family members may design their own costumes, sometimes with assistance from their coach or choreographer, or turn to professional designers.<ref name=AS120818/><ref name=IN120820cos/><ref name=AS120914/><ref name=AS121004/> Costumes may cost thousands of dollars if designed by a top-level costumemaker.\n\nAccording to current ISU regulations, costumes in competition \"must be modest, dignified and appropriate for athletic competition \u2013 not garish or theatrical in design. Clothing may, however, reflect the character of the music chosen.\"<ref name=isuSFTR/> Although the use of flesh-colored fabric means the costumes are often less revealing than they may appear, there have been repeated attempts to ban clothing that gives the impression of \"excessive nudity\" or that is otherwise inappropriate for athletic competition.<ref name=usfsa99rb/> In general, accessories or props are not permitted in competition.<ref name=isuSFTR/> The ISU allowed an exception for the [[original dance]] in the 2007\u20132008 season but not since.\n\n== Eligibility ==\n\n=== Age eligibility ===\nTo compete internationally on the senior level, skaters must be at least 15 before July 1 of the preceding year. To be eligible for junior-level events, a skater must be at least 13 but under 19 before that date (or 21 for male pair skaters and ice dancers).<ref name=espn/><ref name=isuage/> A skater must meet the age requirement ''before'' it becomes July 1 in their place of birth. For example, [[Adelina Sotnikova]] was born a few hours into July 1, 1996 in [[Moscow]] and consequently, was not eligible to compete at Junior Worlds until 2011 and senior Worlds until 2013.<ref name=se1210/> The ISU's rules apply to international events. Many countries have no age requirements for domestic non-ISU competitions, thus, some skaters compete at the senior level nationally while not eligible for international competition.\n\nThe [[International Skating Union|ISU]] has modified its age rules several times. Prior to the 1990s, 12 was the minimum age for senior international competitions.<ref name=cbs980615/> New rules were introduced in 1996, requiring skaters to be at least 15 before July 1 of the preceding year in order to compete at the Olympics, Worlds, Europeans, or Four Continents.<ref name=espn/> The minimum age for all other senior internationals was 14 until July 2014, when it was raised to 15.\n\nDuring the 2005\u201306 season, [[Mao Asada]] of Japan was age-eligible to compete at the Grand Prix Final, where she claimed the title, but she was not permitted to compete at the Olympics. For the [[2008 World Figure Skating Championships|2008 World Championships]], the United States was obliged to send skaters who had placed 5th and 7th at nationals because higher-placed skaters were too young, including a skater who missed the cutoff by 20 days.<ref name=espn/><ref name=agereq/> The ISU has strictly enforced the rules in recent years.<ref name=espn/> However, American pair skater [[Natasha Kuchiki]] was allowed to compete at the [[1990 World Figure Skating Championships|1990 World Championships]] when she was two years too young and American single skater [[Tara Lipinski]], who was 13 at the time the 1996 rules were introduced, was [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] into remaining eligible for future events, along with other skaters who had already competed at the World Championships. A loophole also existed for a few years for underage skaters who had medaled at Junior Worlds.<ref name=cbs000316/>\n\nAs in [[Age requirements in gymnastics#Age falsification|gymnastics]], skating has experienced controversy surrounding possible [[Age fabrication|age falsification]]. On February 14, 2011, questions emerged surrounding nine Chinese skaters. The [[Associated Press]] found that birthdates listed on the [[Chinese Skating Association]]'s website suggested five female skaters, [[Sui Wenjing]], [[Zhang Dan]], [[Yu Xiaoyu]], [[Geng Bingwa]], and [[Xu Binshu]], were younger than their ISU ages, and four male skaters, [[Han Cong]], [[Zhang Hao (figure skater)|Zhang Hao]], [[Jin Yang]], and [[Gao Yu (figure skater)|Gao Yu]], were older.<ref name=espn/> The dates disappeared from the website by February 15.<ref name=feb1711/> On February 17, the ISU said there were no discrepancies for [[Zhang Dan]], [[Zhang Hao (figure skater)|Zhang Hao]], and [[Xu Binshu]] between the birthdates listed on their passports, ISU registration forms and the [[Chinese Olympic Committee]]'s website.<ref name=feb1711/> Athletes in China sometimes face pressure to falsify their age.<ref name=survive/>\n\n=== Other eligibility rules ===\nSkaters may represent a country of which they are not yet a citizen in most competitions, except the Olympics which require citizenship.\n\nAt most international events, each country may send one to a maximum of three entries per discipline. Consequently, even if a skater has a high season's best, he or she may not be sent to major events if their country has many good skaters in their discipline. Some skaters have tried to circumvent this by switching to another country. In response, the ISU introduced rules barring skaters from international events for a certain period of time. In the 2010 regulations, it was 24 months or more from the date of the last ISU Championship.<ref name=genreg2010/> In the 2012 regulations, the minimum was 18 months for singles and 12 months for pairs/ice dancers from the date of their last ISU Championships (Worlds, Europeans, Four Continents, Junior Worlds) and 12 months if they competed in some other international competition.<ref name=genreg2012/> Competitors may sit out for much longer because they also have to obtain a release from their previous federation. The ISU has set no limit to how long a country may hold skaters.<ref name=genreg2012/>\n\nSkaters may lose their ISU eligibility if they perform in an unsanctioned show or competition.\n\nBeginning in the [[2010\u201311 figure skating season|2010\u201311 season]], minimum scores were introduced for the World, European, or Four Continents Championships. In the [[2011\u201312 figure skating season|2011\u201312]] season, different minimum scores were introduced for the Grand Prix series.\n\n== Competitors' expenses, income, and funding ==\nFigure skating is an expensive sport.<ref name=usfscost/><ref name=nyt32611/><ref name=EJ130311/><ref name=tie110920/> This is particularly due to the costs of ice time and coaching.<ref name=nyt991219/> In the late 1980s, the expenses of a top-ten ladies' competitor at the U.S. Championships reached nearly [[United States dollar|US$]]50,000 a year.<ref name=SS880228/> In October 2004, a [[U.S. Figure Skating]] article estimated the annual expense at US$9,000\u2013$10,000 for pre-juvenile, US$18,000 for juvenile, US$35,000\u2013$40,000 for novice, and said junior and senior levels were somewhat more expensive.<ref name=usfscost/> In the 2010s, American senior national medalists had expenses in the mid-five-figure range.<ref name=nyt32611/><ref name=SI130410/> Swiss skater [[St\u00e9phane Lambiel]] said his costs were around [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 100,000 per season.<ref name=AS120402/> World champion [[Patrick Chan]]'s expenses were [[Canadian dollar|Can$]]150,000.<ref name=embracing/> In 2015, [[CBC Sports]] estimated that a Canadian pair team had expenses of about Can$100,000 per year.<ref name=CBC151118b/>\n\nPrize money is relatively low compared to other sports.<ref name=ct111028/> A men's or ladies' singles skater who won the [[2011 World Figure Skating Championships|2011 World Championships]] earned US$45,000,<ref name=isuprev110423/> about 1.8% to 2.5% of the US$1,800,000\u2013$2,400,000 for winners of the tennis [[2011 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and [[2012 Australian Open|Australian Open]].<ref name=usopen/><ref name=ap120123/> A couple who won the pairs or ice dance title split US$67,500.<ref name=isuprev110423/> A winner of the senior [[2011\u201312 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]] in December 2011 earned US$25,000.<ref name=isu111207/>\n\nSome national associations provide funding to some skaters if they meet certain criteria.<ref name=usfsfunding/> Many skaters take part-time jobs and some have tried [[crowdfunding]].<ref name=IN120531/><ref name=CBC151118/> In Germany, many elite skaters join the army to fund their skating.<ref name=ifs110713/> In Italy, some skaters join police agencies' sport groups, such as the [[Polizia Penitenziaria]]'s ''[[Gruppo Sportivo Fiamme Azzurre|Fiamme Azzurre]]'' ([[Carolina Kostner]], [[Anna Cappellini]], [[Luca Lanotte]])<ref name=peniten/><ref name=peniten2/> or [[Polizia di Stato]]'s ''Fiamme Oro'' ([[Federica Faiella]], [[Paolo Bacchini]]).<ref name=polstato/> Some competitive skaters depend on income from shows.<ref name=dilemma/><ref name=promin/> Shows must be sanctioned by their association, i.e. skaters may lose their competitive eligibility if they take part without permission. In some cases, skaters may feel pressure to compete through injury in order to be allowed to perform in a show.<ref name=dilemma/>\n\n== Injuries and health issues ==\nCompetitive skaters generally do not wear helmets or other protective gear. There is a risk of head injuries, particularly in [[pair skating]] as a result of falls from lifts.<ref name=cbs991017/><ref name=binnebose/> Although pair skaters are most susceptible, serious head injuries can occur in all disciplines, including ice dance.<ref name=IN160202/><ref name=IN120713dl/><ref name=abssk2010/> Partners have accidentally slashed each other with their skate blades.<ref name=batessamuelson/><ref name=icenetfeb12/> This may occur when partners drift too close during side-by-side [[camel spins]]. Several female pair skaters have suffered head/face injuries during this element, including [[Elena Berezhnaya]],<ref name=comeback/> [[Jessica Dub\u00e9]],<ref name=cnn070423/> [[Mandy W\u00f6tzel]],<ref name=nytjl980204/> [[Galina Efremenko|Galina Maniachenko (Efremenko)]],<ref name=maniachenko/> and [[Elena Riabchuk]].<ref name=rzinj/>\n\nCommenting on falls and concussions, [[Madison Hubbell]] said that \"Most of the time, the worst falls are on things we kind of take for granted.\"<ref name=IN160202/> [[Shin splints]],<ref name=SM1404/> knee injuries, and back problems are not uncommon.<ref name=NYT090622/><ref name=gs4202/><ref name=podtod/> Hip damage may occur as a result of practising jumps and throws.<ref name=NYT090622/><ref name=taralip/> In rare cases, intensive training of spins may result in subtle concussions ([[Lucinda Ruh]]).<ref name=spincon/><ref name=NBCC140212/>\n\nInjuries have also been sustained by skaters from different teams when there are many skaters practising on the ice.<ref name=densta/> [[Midori Ito]] collided with [[Laetitia Hubert]] at the 1991 World Championships, while [[Oksana Baiul]] and [[Tanja Szewczenko]] collided at the 1994 Olympics, but all went on to compete. On practice sessions with multiple skaters on the ice, the skater whose music is playing conventionally has right of way. In addition, pairs and ice dancers skating as a unit have right of way over those skating separately as changing course is more difficult for a couple.\n\nIn some countries, medical personnel may be slow to respond to accidents. At the [[2000 World Figure Skating Championships|2000 World Championships]] in [[Nice]], France, a pair skater who had been injured in a lift accident lay on the ice for several minutes and had to get up and leave the ice on his own before being offered medical attention.<ref name=AP000329op/>\n\n[[Eating disorders]] are reportedly common in figure skating.<ref name=HP100120/><ref name=HP100121/><ref name=muscles/>\n\nFigure skaters occasionally have positive doping results but it is not common.<ref name=WADA/> Commenting on Soviet skaters, three-time Olympic champion [[Irina Rodnina]] stated in 1991, \"Boys in pairs and singles used drugs, but this was only in August or September. This was done just in training, and everyone was tested (in the Soviet Union) before competitions.\"<ref name=CT910214/>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|History of figure skating}}\n[[File:Jackson Haines2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jackson Haines]], considered to be the father of modern figure skating.]]\nAlthough people have been [[ice skating]] for centuries, figure skating in its current form originated in the mid-19th century. ''A Treatise on Skating'' (1772) by Englishman Robert Jones, is the first known account of figure skating. Competitions were then held in the \"English style\" of skating, which was stiff and formal and bore very little resemblance to modern figure skating. Before the changes in figure skating techniques, there were a limited number of moves that could be performed. This was true in the mid-1800s but was later changed by American skater [[Jackson Haines]], who was considered to be the \"father of modern figure skating\". He introduced a new style of skating in the mid-1860s, incorporating free and expressive techniques, which became known as the \"international style.\" Although popular in Europe, Haines' international style of skating was not widely adopted in the United States until long after his death.<ref name=Haines/>\n\n=== Early 1900s ===\n[[File:Special figures by Panin.svg|thumb|left|[[Special figures]] by [[Nikolai Panin]] at the [[Figure skating at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics]] ]]\n\nThe [[International Skating Union|ISU]] was founded in 1892. The first [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]] were held in 1891, and the first [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]] were held in 1896 and won by [[Gilbert Fuchs]]. Only men competed in these events. In 1902, a woman, [[Madge Syers]], entered the World competition for the first time, finishing second. The ISU quickly banned women from competing against men, but established a separate competition for \"ladies\" in 1906. [[Pair skating]] was introduced at the 1908 World Championships, where the title was won by [[Anna H\u00fcbler]] and [[Heinrich Burger]]. Figure skating was the first winter sport introduced to the Olympics; its Olympic debut came at the [[Figure skating at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=AFS2014/><ref name=ISUHistory/>\n\nOn March 20, 1914 an international figure skating championship was held in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. This was the ancestor of both the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|United States]] and [[Canadian Figure Skating Championships|Canadian National Championships]]. However, international competitions in figure skating were interrupted by [[World War I]].\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, figure skating was dominated by [[Sonja Henie]], who turned competitive success into a lucrative professional career as a movie star and touring skater. Henie also set the fashion for female skaters to wear short skirts and white boots.<ref name=spillhenie/> The top male skaters of this period included [[Gillis Grafstr\u00f6m]] and [[Karl Sch\u00e4fer]].\n\n=== After World War II ===\nSkating competitions were again interrupted for several years by [[World War II]]. After the war, with many European rinks in ruins, skaters from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] began to dominate international competitions and to introduce technical innovations to the sport. [[Dick Button]], 1948 and 1952 Olympic Champion, was the first skater to perform the double axel and triple loop jumps, as well as the flying camel spin.\n\nThe first World Championships in [[ice dance]] were not held until [[1952 World Figure Skating Championships|1952]].<ref name=ISUHistory/> In its early years, ice dance was dominated by British skaters; beginning with [[Jean Westwood (figure skater)|Jean Westwood]] and [[Lawrence Demmy]], British couples won the world title every year until 1960.<ref>James R. Hines (2011). \"Historical Dictionary of Figure Skating\". p. 102. Scarecrow Press</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-G0313-0017-001, Ludmilla Beloussowa, Oleg Protopopow.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Ludmila Belousova]] and [[Oleg Protopopov]] in 1968]]\nOn February 15, 1961, the entire U.S. figure skating team and their coaches were killed in the crash of [[Sabena Flight 548]] in [[Brussels|Brussels, Belgium]] en route to the World Championships in [[Prague]]. This tragedy sent the U.S. skating program into a period of rebuilding.\n\nAt the same time, the [[Soviet Union]] rose to become a dominant power in the sport, especially in the disciplines of pair skating and ice dance. At every Winter Olympics from 1964 until 2006, a Soviet or Russian pair won gold in pair skating, often considered one of the longest winning streaks in modern sports history.<ref>[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/35400871/ns/sports-olympic_sports/ Shen-Zhao set record in pairs short program]</ref><ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/olympics/index.ssf/2010/02/shen_zhao_capture_pairs_skatin.html Shen, Zhao capture pairs skating gold]</ref><ref>[http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-features/news/newsid=444839.html Russian skating slump hits home hard]</ref> The [[1967 World Figure Skating Championships|1967 World Championships]] was the last event held in an outdoor rink.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.iceskatingintnl.com/archive/results_euros/2011%20Euro%20Preview.htm |title=2011 European Championships Preview |first=Alexandra |last=Stevenson |year=2011 |work=IceSkatingIntnl.com |accessdate=March 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921114844/http://www.iceskatingintnl.com/archive/results_euros/2011%20Euro%20Preview.htm |archivedate=September 21, 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Effect of television and the present day ===\n[[Compulsory figures]] formerly accounted for up to 60% of the score in singles figure skating,<ref name=CBS981216/> which meant that skaters who could build up a big lead in figures could win competitions even if they were mediocre free skaters. As [[television]] coverage of skating events became more important, so did free skating. Beginning in 1968, the ISU began to progressively reduce the weight of figures and introduced the short program in 1973.<ref name=CBS981216/> With these changes, the emphasis in competitive figure skating shifted to increasing athleticism. By the 1980s, some skaters began practising [[Quad (figure skating)|quadruple jumps]]. [[Jozef Sabovcik]] of Czechoslovakia landed a quad [[Toe loop jump|toe loop]] at the [[1986 European Figure Skating Championships|1986 European Championships]] which was recognized at the event but then ruled invalid three weeks later due to a touchdown with his free foot.<ref name=quadevo991202/> At the [[1988 World Figure Skating Championships|1988 World Championships]], [[Kurt Browning]] of Canada landed the first quad toe loop which has remained ratified.<ref name=nyt880326/> Although it was expected that quads would soon become an important part of men's skating, it was a number of years before this happened.<ref name=quadevo991202/> Japan's [[Midori Ito]] landed the first triple axel by a woman. Worth only 20% by 1989, figures were eliminated entirely from international competition in 1990.<ref name=CBS981216/>\n\nTelevision showing skaters in the [[kiss and cry]] area after competing contributed to the sport's popularity.<ref name=macur20100222/> Television also played a role in removing the restrictive [[amateurism|amateur]] status rules that once governed the sport. In May 1990, the ISU voted to allow skaters who were intending to skate professionally to return to ISU competition if they obtained their national association's permission.<ref name=nyt900502/> To retain skaters who might otherwise have given up their eligibility to participate in lucrative professional events, in 1995 the ISU introduced prize money at its major competitions, funded by revenues from selling the TV rights to those events.\n\nIn 1984, more than 24 million people in Great Britain watched ice dance pair [[Jayne Torvill]] and [[Christopher Dean]] earn unanimous 6.0s for presentation, the only perfect score in Olympic skating history, which was ranked the 8th greatest sporting moment in a UK poll.<ref name=BBC840214/><ref name=CH4GSM/> In the 1993 National Sports Study II, considered by the [[Associated Press]] as the largest study of spectator sport popularity in America, ladies' figure skating was the second most popular spectator sport in America, just behind [[National Football League|NFL football]] out of over 100 sports surveyed.<ref name=1993nssII/> The 1993 study found that three figure skaters \u2013 [[Dorothy Hamill]], [[Peggy Fleming]], and [[Scott Hamilton (figure skater)|Scott Hamilton]]<ref name=lvsun/> \u2013 were among the eight most popular athletes in the United States, out of over 800 athletes surveyed.<ref name=iebrennan/> [[Dorothy Hamill]] was statistically tied with [[Mary Lou Retton]] as the most popular athlete in America. The [[Tonya Harding]] scandal in 1994 increased interest in figure skating.<ref name=nyt940206/> The first night of the ladies' figure skating competition in the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] achieved higher TV [[Nielsen ratings]] than that year's Super Bowl and was the most watched sports television program of all time, to that date.<ref name=usatslip/>\n\nSpectators sometimes throw a variety of items, most commonly stuffed toys and flowers, onto the ice in support of their favorite skaters but officials discourage flowers which are not fully wrapped due to the possibility of debris disrupting or endangering the following skaters.<ref name=TGAM130119/><ref name=LFP130308/>\n\nCountries who have produced many successful skaters in recent decades include Russia and the former Soviet Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, China, France, Germany, and Italy. While the sport has grown in East Asia, training opportunities in South Asia are limited due to a scarcity of ice rinks. [[India]] had only four major indoor ice rinks as of 2011, but there were plans for ten more to be built, mostly in malls, over the following five years.<ref name=india/>\n\n[[Four skating]] has mostly disappeared while [[synchronized skating]], singles/pair skating and ice dance have grown. On April 6, 2011, the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] officially confirmed the approval of a team event, which was introduced at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].<ref name=reu110406/> The elimination of the [[compulsory dance (ice dance)|compulsory dance]] provided space for the team event.<ref name=reu120329/> Each team is composed of a men's and ladies' singles skater, a pair, and an ice dance duo. Ten teams may compete, with five eliminated after the short program.<ref name=ctteam/> In December 2011, the ISU released details of the qualifying system and the competition.<ref name=isu9861/>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Jayne_Torvill_and_Christopher_Dean_-_Dancing_on_Ice_2011.jpg|thumb|right| [[Torvill and Dean]] on ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'']]\nIn 1937, [[Sonja Henie]] appeared in the film ''[[Thin Ice (1937 film)|Thin Ice]]''. Figure skating has been the focus of several later Hollywood films, including ''[[The Cutting Edge]]'' (and its sequels, ''[[The Cutting Edge: Going for the Gold]]'', ''[[The Cutting Edge: Chasing the Dream]]'' and ''[[The Cutting Edge: Fire and Ice]]''), ''[[Ice Princess]]'', ''[[Ice Castles]]'', ''[[Ice Angel]]'', ''[[Go Figure (film)|Go Figure]]'', ''[[Blades of Glory]]'', and ''[[I, Tonya]]''. Olympic champion [[Brian Boitano]] was parodied in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' in the song \"[[What Would Brian Boitano Do?]]\". \n\nIn 2006, ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' began broadcasting in the UK. The show involves celebrities and their professional partners figure skating in front of a panel of judges. The judges have included British Olympic gold medalists [[Torvill and Dean]] and double Olympic champion [[Katarina Witt]]. The show has since been [[Dancing on Ice around the world|exported to eight other countries]] around the world. U.S. national champion [[Johnny Weir]] was the focus of the reality show ''Be Good Johnny Weir'' which aired on the [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]]. Figure skating plays a prominent role in ''[[Yuri on Ice]]'', an anime that aired in autumn 2016 which focuses on the career of fictional figure skater Katsuki Yuri.\n\n== References

Such things as what attributes and skills will define characters are left to be determined by the [[Game Master]] and players, and several different optional systems for resolving actions and conflicts are offered. ''Fudge'' is not tied to any particular [[genre]] or setting and world builders are encouraged to invent appropriate attributes and rules tailored to the campaign.<ref name=\"fudgerules\">{{Cite web| last =Kitkowski| first =Andrew| title =FUDGE Expanded Edition: Playtest Review| date =2000-11-14| url =http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_3576.html| accessdate = 2007-09-24  }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe project that would lead to ''Fudge'' was first proposed by [[Steffan O'Sullivan]] in November 1992 on the rec.games.design newsgroup,<ref>[https://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.design/msg/4dc266facabc766f net.rpg.freeform 1 of 2]</ref> and over the following months that online community would contribute to the directed project.<ref>[https://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.design/msg/03ec8dc478bdc253 net.rpg.freeform 2 of 2]</ref> One of the earliest stipulations of O'Sullivan was that the basic system would always remain free to the public over the internet, and the [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] of the 1995 version still is.<ref name=\"desnotes\">[http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/fud-des.html Fudge Designer's notes]</ref> The 1995 version of ''Fudge'' is available under a non-commercial licence.\n\n[[Grey Ghost Press]], with the endorsement of Steffan O'Sullivan, publishes an expanded form of the ''Fudge'' system. There have been three Grey Ghost Press editions, the most current being the ''Fudge 10th Anniversary Edition'', which includes several suggested rules systems for common RPG elements and an example basic fantasy \"build\" of the game.\n\nIn March 2004, Grey Ghost Press acquired the copyright of ''Fudge'', and on April 6, 2005, they released a version of ''Fudge'' under the [[Open Game License]].\n\nThe OGL license has allowed the ''[[FATE (role-playing game system)|FATE role-playing game system]]'' to build on ''Fudge'' as its underlying mechanic.<ref>http://rpgblog.typepad.com/rpg_blog/2005/05/the_fate_interv.html</ref>\n\nIn 1999 ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' magazine named ''Fudge'' as one of ''The Millennium's Most Underrated Games''.  Editor [[Scott Haring]] stated that \"''Fudge'' is an extremely flexible, rules-light system. It works great, and everybody who plays it, loves it. Why isn't it more popular? I dunno.\"<ref>{{cite journal| title=Second Sight: The Millennium's Most Influential Company and The Millennium's Most Underrated Game|journal=[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]] (online)|last=Haring| first=Scott D. |authorlink=Scott Haring | url= http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=1240| date=1999-11-25| accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref>\n\n== Name==\nAt the time ''Fudge'' was conceived, it was stylish to give role-playing games acronyms for names (for instance, ''[[GURPS]]'' and ''[[TWERPS]]'') and originally the usenet design project referred to the game as ''SLUG'', for \"Simple Laid-back Universal Game\".<ref name=\"desnotes\" /> However, this was soon changed to ''FUDGE'' for \"Free-form Universal Donated Gaming Engine\", but also because the word invoked connotations of an easy to make source of fun. This again was changed when Grey Ghost Press released their 1995 hardcopy version of the game, to \"Free-form Universal Do-it-yourself Gaming Engine\".\n\nWith the publication of the Expanded Edition in 2000, the fad for acronym-based names had long since faded, and the writer and the publisher both felt that the forced acronym had become irrelevant. The game has been referred to officially as just ''Fudge'' ever since, though fans often still refer to it in the old manner as ''FUDGE''.\n\n==Game mechanics==\n[[Image:FUDGE 4dF probability.svg|thumb|300px|right|Probability of results when rolling 4dF]]\nIn ''Fudge'', character Traits such as [[attribute (role-playing games)|Attributes]] and [[skill (role-playing)|Skills]], are rated on a seven-level, ascending [[adjective]] scale: ''Terrible, Poor, Mediocre, Fair, Good, Great,'' and ''Superb.''\n\n''Fudge'' characters can also have Gifts and Faults, which are positive and negative traits that do not fit into the adjective scale.\n\n===Fudge dice===\n[[File:White Fudge Dice.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A set of Fudge dice]]\n''Fudge'' uses customized \"''Fudge'' [[dice]]\" which have an equal number of plus, minus and blank sides. A number of these dice are rolled, usually four at a time (\"4dF\" in Fudge [[dice notation]]), and for every plus side that comes up the result of using the Trait is considered one step higher (e.g. from ''Fair'' to ''Good'') and for every minus side that comes up the result is considered one step lower. The goal is to match or surpass the difficulty level, also on the adjective scale, of the test. Thus, a ''Good'' attribute is considered to be ''Great'' if the player were to roll two plus sides, one minus side, and one blank\u2014the minus side cancels out one of the plus sides and the remaining plus side raises the result by one step. The same ''Good'' attribute would be considered ''Poor'' if you were to roll three minus sides and one blank. The same dice roll can be achieved with six-sided dice, treating a 1 or 2 as [\u2212], a 3-4 as [&nbsp;] and a 5-6 as [+].\n\nThere are also several alternative dice systems available that use ten-sided dice, coins, or playing cards.\n\n==Complexity==\nThe rules of ''Fudge'' are highly customizable and can be adjusted for the level of simplicity or complexity desired by the Game Master and Players. Overall, the system is designed to encourage role-playing over strict adherence to an arbitrary set of rules. In fact, the main ''Fudge'' documents encourage players to \"Just Fudge It\"; that is, to focus on the story being created rather than on the game rules. For example, one character creation method encourages players to first write prose descriptions of their characters and then translate those into ''Fudge'' Traits.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Fudge (RPG system)}}\n* Grey Ghost Press' [http://www.fudgerpg.com/ ''Fudge'' webpage]\n* RPGGeek Listing [http://rpggeek.com/rpg/204/fudge Fudge System]\n\n{{Fudge Games}}\n{{RPG systems}}\n\n[[Category:Role-playing game systems]]\n[[Category:Universal role-playing games]]\n[[Category:Open-source tabletop games]]\n[[Category:Games and sports introduced in 1992]]", "sha1": "f4q6iiynwdp3ldvpbdta8179zlx6z47"}}, {"title": "February 12", "ns": "0", "id": "11158", "revision": {"id": "864692084", "parentid": "864672779", "timestamp": "2018-10-18T20:52:44Z", "contributor": {"username": "Deb", "id": "1219"}, "comment": "Undid revision 864672779 by [[Special:Contributions/Bumblebesam|Bumblebesam]] ([[User talk:Bumblebesam|talk]]) - no new entries without references", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{calendar}}\n{{This date in recent years}}\n{{Day}}\n\n==Events==\n* [[881]] &ndash;

J. Ayer]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Jesuit}}\nFrederick Charles Copleston was born 10 April 1907 near [[Taunton]], Somerset, England. He was raised in the [[Anglican]] faith\u2014his uncle, [[Reginald Stephen Copleston]], was an [[Anglican Diocese of Calcutta|Anglican bishop of Calcutta]]; another uncle, [[Ernest Copleston]], was the [[Bishop of Colombo]]. Copleston was educated at [[Marlborough College]] from 1920 to 1925.<ref name=\"gifford\"/> At the age of eighteen, he converted to the Roman Catholic faith, which caused great stress in his family.<ref name=\"gifford\"/> Despite his initial objections, his father helped him complete his education at [[St John's College, Oxford]], where he studied from 1925 to 1929. He graduated from [[Oxford University]] in 1929 having managed a third in classical moderations and a good second at [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]].<ref name=\"gifford\"/>\n\nIn 1930, Copleston became a [[Jesuit]].<ref name=\"gifford\"/> After studying at the Jesuit novitiate in Roehampton for two years, he resettled at Heythrop, where in 1937 he was ordained a Jesuit priest at [[Heythrop College, University of London|Heythrop College]].<ref name=\"gifford\"/> In 1938 he traveled to Germany to complete his training, returning to Britain just before the outbreak of war in 1939.<ref name=\"gifford\"/> Copleston originally intended to study for his doctorate at the Gregorian University in Rome, but the war now made that impossible. Instead, he accepted an offer to return to Heythrop College to teach the history of philosophy to the few remaining Jesuits there.<ref name=\"gifford\"/>\n\nWhile teaching at Heythrop College, Copleston began writing his influential multi-volume ''[[A History of Philosophy (Copleston)|A History of Philosophy]]'' (1946\u201375), a textbook that presents clear accounts of [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], medieval, and modern philosophy.<ref>The original edition and Double Day edition were published in 9 volumes, whereas the Continuum edition was published in 11 volumes.</ref> Still highly respected, Copleston's history has been described as \"a monumental achievement\" that \"stays true to the authors it discusses, being very much a work in exposition\".<ref name=\"gifford\"/>\n\nCopleston achieved a degree of popularity in the media for [[Copleston\u2013Russell debate|debating]] the [[existence of God]] with [[Bertrand Russell]] in a celebrated 1948 [[BBC]] broadcast;<ref>{{cite web|title=A Debate on the Existence of God |publisher=YouTube | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPdpEJk78E |accessdate=8 March 2014}}</ref> the following year he debated [[logical positivism]] and the meaningfulness of [[Sacred language|religious language]] with his friend the [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] [[A. J. Ayer]].<ref name=\"telegraph-beeson\"/>\n\nThroughout the rest of his academic career, Copleston accepted a number of honorary roles, including Visiting Professor at [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in Rome, where he spent six months each year lecturing from 1952 to 1968.<ref name=\"gifford\"/> In 1970, he was made Fellow of the [[British Academy]] (FBA), and in 1972 he was given a personal professorship from Heythrop College, since re-established by the [[University of London]]. In 1975, he was made an Honorary Fellow of St. John's College, Oxford.<ref name=\"gifford\"/>\n\nAfter officially retiring in 1974, he continued to lecture. From 1974 to 1982, Copleston was Visiting Professor at the [[Santa Clara University|University of Santa Clara]], and from 1979 to 1981, he delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]], which were published as ''Religion and the One''. These lectures were attempted to \"express themes perennial in his thinking and more personal than in his history\".<ref name=\"gifford\"/> Toward the end of his life, Copleston received honorary doctorates from several institutions, including Santa Clara University, California, [[Uppsala University]], and the [[University of St Andrews]].<ref name=\"gifford\"/>\n\nCopleston was offered memberships in the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] and in the [[Aristotelian Society]].<ref name=\"gifford-fcc\"/> In 1993 he was made [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]].<ref name=\"independent\"/> Copleston died on 3 February 1994 at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London, at the age of 86.<ref name=\"gifford\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn addition to his influential multi-volume ''[[A History of Philosophy (Copleston)|History of Philosophy]]'' (1946\u201375), one of Copleston's most significant contributions to modern philosophy was his work on the theories of Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]. He attempted to clarify Aquinas's [[Quinquae viae|Five Ways]] (in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'') by making a distinction between ''[[in fieri]]'' causes and ''[[in esse]]'' causes. By doing so, Copleston makes clear that Aquinas wanted to put forth the concept of an omnipresent God rather than a being that could have disappeared after setting the chain of cause and effect into motion.<ref name=\"ashgate-hensel\"/><ref name=\"abingdon\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"abingdon\">{{cite web |title=The Cosmological Argument for The Existence of God |publisher=Abingdon |url=http://study.abingdon.org.uk/rs/AS%20Philosophy%20notes/cosmological_argument.pdf |accessdate=29 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104641/http://study.abingdon.org.uk/rs/AS%20Philosophy%20notes/cosmological_argument.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ashgate-hensel\">{{cite book|last=Hensel |first=Howard M. |title=The Prism of Just War: Asian and Western Perspectives on the Legitimate Use of Military Force |date=2013| publisher=Ashgate Publishing |isbn=9781409499510 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2PR7zou5msMC&pg=PT101&lpg=PT101&dq=Frederick+Copleston+Thomas+Aquinas&source=bl&ots=weHOk8hlgd&sig=1BYXZPLa783d0kDP4xaaqrDztDM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwADgKahUKEwjm1MiN3OfIAhVDdT4KHee-ALQ#v=onepage&q=Frederick%20Copleston%20Thomas%20Aquinas&f=false}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"gifford\">{{cite web|last=Cameron |first=Jon |title=Frederick Charles Copleston |publisher=Gifford Lectures | url=http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=43 | accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"gifford-fcc\">{{cite web|title=Frederick Charles Copleston |publisher=Gifford Lectures |url=http://www.giffordlectures.org/lecturers/frederick-charles-copleston |accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"independent\">{{cite news|title=Obituary: The Rev Professor Frederick Copleston SJ |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=5 February 1994|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-the-rev-professor-frederick-copleston-sj-1392152.html |accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"telegraph-beeson\">{{cite book|last=Beeson |first=Trevor |title=Priests and Prelates: The Daily Telegraph Clerical Obituaries |date=2006 |publisher=A&C Black |page=112 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=awPGiqoCrSgC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=Frederick+Copleston+Ayer+logical+positivism+debate&source=bl&ots=8dUYA762Xx&sig=9VJMVOrbnXAAc-uq35kuUkcGMac&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMIkbmU-drnyAIVgzU-Ch0gsAo4#v=onepage&q=Frederick%20Copleston%20Ayer%20logical%20positivism%20debate&f=false |isbn=978-0-82648-100-9 |accessdate=30 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{YouTube|hXPdpEJk78E|Fr.

Finance can also be defined as the science of [[money management]]. Participants in the [[market (economics) | market]] aim to price assets based on their risk level, fundamental value, and their expected [[rate of return]]. Finance can be broken into three sub-categories: [[public finance]], [[corporate finance]] and [[personal finance]].\n\n==Areas of finance==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Frankfurt Stock Exchange 1.jpg|[[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], European Center of finance, Frankfurt am Main.\nFile:Wall Street - New York Stock Exchange.jpg|[[Wall Street]], American center of finance.\nFile:The Source London Stock Exchange.jpg|[[London Stock Exchange]], British centre of finance.\n</gallery>\n\n===Personal finance===\n{{Main|Personal finance}}\nQuestions in personal finance revolve around:\n* Protection against unforeseen personal events, as well as  in the wider economies\n* Transference of family wealth across generations (bequests and inheritance)\n* Effects of tax policies (tax subsidies or penalties) management of personal finances\n* Effects of credit on individual financial standing\n* Development of a savings plan or financing for large purchases (auto, education, home)\n* Planning a secure financial future in an environment of economic instability\n* Development of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve System\n* Pursuing a checking and/or a savings account\n\n[[File:Warren_Buffett_KU_Visit.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Warren Buffett]] CEO & chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, American investor, business magnate, and philanthropist.

Net worth is a person's balance sheet, calculated by adding up all assets under that person's control, minus all liabilities of the household, at one point in time.  Household cash flows total up all from the expected sources of income within a year, minus all expected expenses within the same year.  From this analysis, the financial planner can determine to what degree and in what time the personal goals can be accomplished.\n# '''[[Insurance|Adequate protection]]''': the analysis of how to protect a household from unforeseen risks.  These risks can be divided into the following: liability, property, death, disability, health and long term care.  Some of these risks may be self-insurable, while most will require the purchase of an insurance contract.  Determining how much insurance to get, at the most cost effective terms requires knowledge of the market for personal insurance.  Business owners, professionals, athletes and entertainers require specialized insurance professionals to adequately protect themselves.  Since insurance also enjoys some tax benefits, utilizing insurance investment products may be a critical piece of the overall investment planning.\n# '''[[Tax planning]]''': typically the income tax is the single largest expense in a household.  Managing taxes is not a question of if you will pay taxes, but when and how much.  Government gives many incentives in the form of tax deductions and credits, which can be used to reduce the lifetime tax burden.  Most modern governments use a progressive tax.  Typically, as one's income grows, a higher [[Tax rate#Marginal|marginal rate of tax]] must be paid. Understanding how to take advantage of the myriad tax breaks when planning one's personal finances can make a significant impact in which it can later save you money in the long term.\n# '''Investment and accumulation goals''': planning how to accumulate enough money \u2013 for large purchases and life events \u2013 is what most people consider to be financial planning.  Major reasons to accumulate assets include purchasing a house or car, starting a business, paying for education expenses, and saving for retirement. Achieving these goals requires projecting what they will cost, and when you need to withdraw funds that will be necessary to be able to achieve these goals.  A major risk to the household in achieving their accumulation goal is the rate of price increases over time, or [[inflation]].  Using net present value calculators, the financial planner will suggest a combination of asset earmarking and regular savings to be invested in a variety of investments.  In order to overcome the rate of inflation, the investment portfolio has to get a higher rate of return, which typically will subject the portfolio to a number of risks.  Managing these portfolio risks is most often accomplished using asset allocation, which seeks to diversify investment risk and opportunity.  This asset allocation will prescribe a percentage allocation to be invested in stocks (either preferred stock or common stock), bonds (for example mutual bonds or government bonds, or corporate bonds), cash and alternative investments.  The allocation should also take into consideration the personal risk profile of every investor, since risk attitudes vary from person to person.\n# '''Retirement planning''' is the process of understanding how much it costs to live at retirement, and coming up with a plan to distribute assets to meet any income shortfall. Methods for retirement plans include taking advantage of government allowed structures to manage tax liability including: individual ([[Individual retirement account|IRA]]) structures, or employer sponsored [[retirement plans]], annuities and life insurance products. \n# '''[[Estate planning]]''' involves planning for the disposition of one's assets after death.  Typically, there is a tax due to the state or federal government at one's death.  Avoiding these taxes means that more of one's assets will be distributed to one's heirs.  One can leave one's assets to family, friends or charitable groups.\n\n===Corporate finance===\n{{Main|Corporate finance}}\n\n[[File:JackWelchApril2012.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Jack Welch]] an American business executive, author, and [[chemical engineer]]. He was chairman and CEO of [[General Electric]] between 1981 and 2001. During his tenure at GE, the company's value rose 4,000%.]]\nCorporate finance deals with the sources funding and the [[capital structure]] of corporations, the actions that managers take to increase the value of the firm to the shareholders, and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources.  Although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms, rather than corporations alone, the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms.  Corporate finance generally involves balancing risk and profitability, while attempting to maximize an entity's assets, net incoming cash flow and the value of its [[stock]], and generically entails three primary areas of capital resource allocation. In the first, \"capital budgeting\", management must choose which \"projects\" (if any) to undertake. The discipline of [[capital budgeting]] may employ standard [[business valuation]] techniques or even extend to [[real options valuation]]; see [[Financial modeling#Accounting|Financial modeling]].  The second, \"sources of capital\" relates to how these investments are to be funded: investment capital can be provided through different sources, such as by shareholders, in the form of [[Equity (finance)|equity]] (privately or via an [[initial public offering]]), [[creditor]]s, often in the form of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and the firm's operations ([[cash flow]]). Short-term funding or [[working capital]] is mostly provided by banks extending a line of credit. The balance between these elements forms the company's [[capital structure]].  The third, \"the dividend policy\", requires management to determine whether any unappropriated profit (excess cash) is to be retained for future investment / operational requirements, or instead to be distributed to shareholders, and if so, in what form.  Short term financial management is often termed \"[[working capital management]]\", and relates to [[cash management|cash-]], [[inventory]]- and [[debtor]]s management.\n\nCorporate finance also includes within its scope business valuation, stock investing, or [[investment management]]. An investment is an acquisition of an [[asset]] in the hope that it will maintain or increase its value over time that will in hope give back a higher rate of return when it comes to disbursing dividends. In [[List of finance topics#Investment management|investment management]]{{spaced ndash}} in choosing a [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]]{{spaced ndash}} one has to use financial analysis to determine ''what'', ''how much'' and ''when'' to invest. To do this, a company must:\n* Identify relevant objectives and constraints: institution or individual goals, time horizon, risk aversion and tax considerations;\n* Identify the appropriate strategy: active versus passive hedging strategy\n* Measure the portfolio performance\n\n[[File:James_Simons_2007.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[James Harris Simons]] American mathematician, [[Hedge fund|hedge fund manager]], and philanthropist. He is known as a [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative investor]] and in 1982 founded [[Renaissance Technologies]], a private hedge fund based in East Setauket, NY.]]\n\nFinancial management overlaps with the financial function of the [[accounting profession]]. However, [[financial accounting]] is the reporting of historical financial information, while financial management is concerned with the allocation of capital resources to increase a firm's value to the shareholders and increase their rate of return on the investments.\n\n[[Financial risk management]], an element of corporate finance, is the practice of creating and protecting [[economic value]] in a [[business|firm]] by using [[financial instrument]]s to manage exposure to [[financial risk|risk]], particularly [[credit risk]] and [[market risk]]. (Other risk types include [[Foreign exchange risk|foreign exchange]], shape, [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]], sector, [[Liquidity risk|liquidity]], [[inflation]] risks, etc.)  It focuses on when and how to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] using financial instruments; in this sense it overlaps with [[financial engineering]].  Similar to general [[risk management]], financial risk management requires identifying its sources, measuring it (see: [[Risk measure#Examples]]), and formulating plans to address these, and can be qualitative and quantitative. In the banking sector worldwide, the [[Basel Accords]] are generally adopted by internationally active banks for tracking, reporting and exposing operational, credit and market risks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs179.htm|title=The Basel Committee's response to the financial crisis: report to the G20|date=2010-10-19|website=www.bis.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref>\n\n====Financial services====\n{{Main|Financial services}}\nAn entity whose income exceeds its expenditure can lend or invest the excess income to help that excess income produce more income in the future. Though on the other hand, an entity whose income is less than its expenditure can raise capital by borrowing or selling equity claims, decreasing its expenses, or increasing its income. The lender can find a borrower\u2014a [[financial intermediary]] such as a [[bank]]\u2014or buy notes or bonds (corporate bonds, government bonds, or mutual bonds) in the [[bond market]]. The lender receives interest, the borrower pays a higher interest than the lender receives, and the financial intermediary earns the difference for arranging the loan.\n\nA bank aggregates the activities of many borrowers and lenders. A bank accepts deposits from lenders, on which it pays interest. The bank then lends these deposits to borrowers. Banks allow borrowers and lenders, of different sizes, to coordinate their activity.\n\nFinance is used by individuals ([[personal finance]]), by governments ([[public finance]]), by businesses ([[corporate finance]]) and by a wide variety of other organizations such as schools and non-profit organizations. In general, the goals of each of the above activities are achieved through the use of appropriate financial instruments and methodologies, with consideration to their institutional setting.\n\nFinance is one of the most important aspects of [[business management]] and includes analysis related to the use and acquisition of funds for the enterprise.\n\nIn corporate finance, a company's [[capital structure]] is the total mix of financing methods it uses to raise funds. One method is ''debt financing'', which includes bank loans and bond sales. Another method is ''[[equity financing]]'' \u2013 the sale of stock by a company to investors, the original shareholders (they own a portion of the business) of a share.  Ownership of a share gives the shareholder certain contractual rights and powers, which typically include the right to receive declared dividends and to vote the proxy on important matters (e.g., board elections).  The owners of both bonds (either government bonds or corporate bonds) and stock (whether its preferred stock or common stock), may be ''[[institutional investor]]s'' \u2013 financial institutions such as investment banks and [[pension fund]]s&nbsp; or private individuals, called ''[[private investors]]'' or ''retail investors''.\n\n===Public finance===\n{{Main|Public finance}}\nPublic finance describes finance as related to sovereign states and sub-national entities (states/provinces, counties, municipalities, etc.) and related public entities (e.g. school districts) or agencies. It usually encompasses a long-term strategic perspective regarding investment decisions that affect public entities.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Doss|first1=Daniel|last2=Sumrall|first2=William|last3=Jones|first3=Don|title=Strategic Finance for Criminal Justice Organizations|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1439892237|page=23|edition=1st}}</ref>  These long-term strategic periods usually encompass five or more years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Doss|first1=Daniel|last2=Sumrall|first2=William|last3=Jones|first3=Don|title=Strategic Finance for Criminal Justice Organizations|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1439892237|pages=53\u201354|edition=1st}}</ref>  Public finance is primarily concerned with:\n* Identification of required expenditure of a public sector entity\n* Source(s) of that entity's revenue\n* The budgeting process\n* Debt issuance ([[municipal bond]]s) for public works projects\n\nCentral banks, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]] banks in the [[United States]] and [[Bank of England]] in the [[United Kingdom]], are strong players in public finance, acting as [[lender of last resort|lenders of last resort]] as well as strong influences on monetary and credit conditions in the economy.<ref>Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System of the United States.

This may include the objective of business, targets set, and results in financial terms, e.g., the target set for sale, resulting cost, growth, required investment to achieve the planned sales, and financing source for the investment.\n\nA budget may be long term or short term. Long term budgets have a time horizon of 5\u201310&nbsp;years giving a vision to the company; short term is an annual budget which is drawn to control and operate in that particular year.\n\nBudgets will include proposed fixed asset requirements and how these expenditures will be financed. Capital budgets are often adjusted annually (done every year) and should be part of a longer-term Capital Improvements Plan.\n\nA cash budget is also required. The working capital requirements of a business are monitored at all times to ensure that there are sufficient funds available to meet short-term expenses.\n\nThe cash budget is basically a detailed plan that shows all expected sources and uses of cash when it comes to spending it appropriately. The cash budget has the following six main sections:\n\n# '''Beginning cash balance''' \u2013 contains the last period's closing cash balance, in other words, the remaining cash of the last year.\n# '''Cash collections''' \u2013 includes all expected cash receipts (all sources of cash for the period considered, mainly sales)\n# '''Cash disbursements''' \u2013 lists all planned cash outflows for the period such as dividend, excluding interest payments on short-term loans, which appear in the financing section. All expenses that do not affect cash flow are excluded from this list (e.g. depreciation, amortization, etc.)\n# '''Cash excess or deficiency''' \u2013 a function of the cash needs and cash available. Cash needs are determined by the total cash disbursements plus the minimum cash balance required by company policy. If total cash available is less than cash needs, a deficiency exists.\n# '''Financing''' \u2013 discloses the planned borrowings and repayments of those planned borrowings, including interest.\n\n==Financial theory==\n\n===Financial economics===\n{{Main|Financial economics}}\n\nFinancial economics is the branch of [[economics]] studying the interrelation of financial [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], such as [[price]]s, [[interest rate]]s and shares, as opposed to [[goods and services]]. Financial economics concentrates on influences of [[Real vs. nominal in economics|real]] economic variables on financial ones, in contrast to pure finance.  It centres on managing risk in the context of the [[financial market]]s, and the resultant [[economic model|economic]] and [[financial model]]s.  It essentially explores how [[homo economicus|rational investors]] would apply risk and return to the problem of an [[investment]] policy.  Here, the twin assumptions of [[rational pricing|rationality]] and [[efficient-market hypothesis|market efficiency]] lead to [[modern portfolio theory]] (the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]]), and to the [[Black\u2013Scholes model|Black\u2013Scholes]] theory for [[Valuation of options|option valuation]]; it further studies phenomena and models where these assumptions do not hold, or are extended. \"Financial economics\", at least formally, also considers investment under \"[[certainty]]\" ([[Fisher separation theorem]], [[The Theory of Investment Value|\"theory of investment value\"]], [[Modigliani\u2013Miller theorem]]) and hence also contributes to corporate finance theory. [[Financial econometrics]] is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterize the relationships suggested.\n\nAlthough they are closely related, the disciplines of economics and finance are distinct. The \u201ceconomy\u201d is a social institution that organizes a society's production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, all of which must be financed.\n\n===Financial mathematics===\n{{Main|Financial mathematics}}\nFinancial mathematics is a field of [[applied mathematics]], concerned with [[financial market]]s. The subject has a close relationship with the discipline of [[financial economics]], which is concerned with much of the underlying theory that is involved in financial mathematics.  Generally, [[mathematical finance]] will derive, and extend, the [[Mathematical model|mathematical]] or [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] models suggested by financial economics. In terms of practice, mathematical finance also overlaps heavily with the field of [[computational finance]] (also known as ''[[financial engineering]]''). Arguably, these are largely synonymous, although the latter focuses on application, while the former focuses on modelling and derivation (''see: [[Quantitative analyst]]'').  The field is largely focused on the modelling of [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], although other important subfields include [[actuarial science|insurance mathematics]] and quantitative [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio problems]]. See [[Outline of finance#Mathematical tools|Outline of finance: Mathematical tools]]; [[Outline of finance#Derivatives pricing|Outline of finance: Derivatives pricing]].\n\n===Experimental finance===\n{{Main|Experimental finance}}\n\n[[Experimental finance]] aims to establish different market settings and environments to observe experimentally and provide a lens through which science can analyze agents' behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows, information diffusion and aggregation, price setting mechanisms, and returns processes. Researchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing financial economics theory makes valid predictions and therefore prove them, and attempt to discover new principles on which such theory can be extended and be applied to future financial decisions. Research may proceed by conducting trading simulations or by establishing and studying the behavior, and the way that these people act or react, of people in artificial competitive market-like settings.\n\n===Behavioral finance===\n{{Main|Behavioral economics}}\n\n[[Behavioral finance]] studies how the psychology of investors or managers affects financial decisions and markets when making a decision that can impact either negatively or positively on one of their areas. Behavioral finance has grown over the last few decades to become central and very important to finance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shefrin|first1=Hersh|title=Beyond greed and fear: Understanding behavioral finance and the psychology of investing|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0195304213|page=ix|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hX18tBx3VPsC&lpg=PR9&dq=growth%20of%20behavioral%20finance&pg=PR9#v=onepage&q=growth%20of%20behavioral%20finance&f=false|accessdate=8 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nBehavioral finance includes such topics as:\n# Empirical studies that demonstrate significant deviations from classical theories.\n# Models of how psychology affects and impacts trading and prices\n# Forecasting based on these methods.\n# Studies of experimental asset markets and use of models to forecast experiments.\n\nA strand of behavioral finance has been dubbed [[quantitative behavioral finance]], which uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases in conjunction with valuation. Some of these endeavors has been led by [[Gunduz Caginalp]] (Professor of Mathematics and Editor of [[Journal of Behavioral Finance]] during 2001-2004) and collaborators including [[Vernon L. Smith|Vernon Smith]] (2002 Nobel Laureate in Economics), David Porter, Don Balenovich, Vladimira Ilieva, Ahmet Duran). Studies by Jeff Madura, Ray Sturm and others have demonstrated significant behavioral effects in stocks and exchange traded funds. Among other topics, quantitative behavioral finance studies behavioral effects together with the non-classical assumption of the finiteness of assets.\n<!--\nDoesn't really belong under theory section...\n===Intangible asset finance===\n{{Main|Intangible asset finance}}\n\nIntangible asset finance is the area of finance that deals with intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, goodwill, reputation, etc.\n\nIntangible assets are divided into indefinite or definite. The brand name of a company is an indefinite asset; it stays with the company throughout its existence. A patent however, granted to that company for a limited amount of time would be a definite intangible asset.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intangibleasset.asp|title=Intangible Asset Definition {{!}} Investopedia|last=root|date=2003-11-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-27}}</ref>\n-->\n\n==Professional qualifications==\nThere are several related [[professional qualification]]s, that can lead to the field:\n* '''Generalist Finance qualifications:'''\n** Degrees: [[Master of Science in Finance]] (MSF), [[Master of Finance]] (M.Fin), [[Master of Financial Economics]], [[Master of Applied Finance]], [[Master of Liberal Arts]] in Finance (ALM.Fin)\n** Certifications: [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA), [[Certified Treasury Professional]] (CTP), Certified Valuation Analyst (CVA), Certified Patent Valuation Analyst (CPVA), Chartered Business Valuator (CBV), [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA), [[Financial Risk Manager]] (FRM), [[Professional Risk Manager]] (PRM), [[Association of Corporate Treasurers]] (ACT), [[Certified Market Analyst]] (CMA/FAD) Dual Designation, Corporate Finance Qualification (CF), [[Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst]] (CAIA), Chartered Investment Manager (CIM)\n* '''Quantitative Finance qualifications:''' [[Master of Financial Engineering]] (MSFE), [[Master of Quantitative Finance]] (MQF), [[Master of Computational Finance]] (MCF), [[Master of Financial Mathematics]] (MFM), [[Certificate in Quantitative Finance]] (CQF), [[Financial Modeling & Valuation Analyst]] (FMVA).\n* '''Accountancy qualifications''':\n** [[Qualified accountant]]: [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] ([[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]], UK certification), [[Chartered Accountant]] (ACA \u2013 England & Wales certification / CA \u2013 certification in Scotland and Commonwealth countries), [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA, US certification), ACMA/FCMA (Associate/Fellow Chartered Management Accountant) from Chartered Institute of Management Accountant (CIMA), UK.

It was released in 1975 and is based on characters from a series of books by Norwegian cartoonist and author [[Kjell Aukrust]].  It is the most widely seen Norwegian film of all time, having sold some 5.5&nbsp;million tickets since its release to a population which currently numbers just over 5 million.<ref>http://www.caprino.no/movies/en/flaaklypa.asp</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:ElGigante-front.jpg|thumb|right|Full-scale replica of ''Il Tempo Gigante'']]\n[[Image:Il Tempo Gigante.jpg|thumb|right|Model of ''Il Tempo Gigante'']]\nIn the village of Fl\u00e5klypa, [[Lom, Norway|Lom]], [[Gudbrand Valley]] ([[English language|En]]. Pinchcliffe), the inventor Reodor Felgen ([[English language|En]]. Theodore Rimspoke) lives with his animal friends Ludvig ([[English language|En]]. Lambert) (a nervous, pessimistic and melancholic hedgehog) and Solan Gundersen ([[English language|En]]. Sonny Duckworth) (a cheerful and optimistic magpie). Reodor works as a bicycle repairman, though he spends most of his time inventing weird [[Rube Goldberg]]-like contraptions.  One day, the trio discover that one of Reodor's former assistants, Rudolf Blodstrupmoen ([[English language|En]]. Rudolph Gore-Slimey), has stolen his design for a race car engine and has become a world champion [[Formula One]] driver. Solan secures funding from Arab oil sheik Ben Redic Fy Fazan ([[English language|En]]. Abdul Ben Bonanza), who happens to be vacationing in Fl\u00e5klypa, and to enter the race, the trio builds a gigantic racing car: ''Il Tempo Gigante''\u2014a fabulous construction with two extremely big engines (weighing 2.8 tons alone and making the seismometer in [[Bergen]] show 7.8 Richter when started the first time), a body made out of copper, a spinning radar (that turns out to be useful when Blodstrupmoen starts engaging in smoke warfare during the race) and its own blood bank.  Reodor ends up winning despite Blodstrupmoen's attempts at sabotage.\n\n==History==\nIn 1970, Ivo Caprino and his small team of collaborators started work on a 25-minute-long TV special, which would eventually become ''The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix''.  The TV special was a collection of sketches based on Aukrust's books, with no real story line. After 1.5 years of work, it was decided that it didn't really work as a whole, so production on the TV special was stopped (with the exception of some very short clips, no material from it has ever been seen by the public), But about one year after the rejection, Ivo Caprino's son, Remo Caprino, got the idea to make the sketches into a full-length film. Kjell Aukrust, Ivo Caprino, Kjell Syversen and Remo Caprino began at that point to write the script for what would later become ''The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix''.\n\nThe film is heavily inspired by the birthplace of Kjell Aukrust's father, [[Lom, Norway|Lom]]. The Fl\u00e5klypa-mountain is a stylized version of a real mountain, where the valley underneath it is named Fl\u00e5klypa. It is also widely believed that the characters are carricatures of real persons.\n\nThe film was made in 3.5 years by a team of approximately 5 people. Caprino directed and animated; Bjarne Sandemose (Caprino's principal collaborator throughout his career) built most of the props, sets and cars and was in charge of the technical aspects of making the film; Ingeborg Riiser designed the puppets and Gerd Alfsen made the costumes and props.  Charley Patey was the camera man.\n\nWhen it came out in 1975, ''The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix'' was an enormous success in Norway, selling 1 million tickets in its first year of release.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} It remains the biggest box office hit of all time in Norway{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} (Caprino Studios claim it has sold 5.5&nbsp;million tickets to date) and was also released in many other countries. The film held the record for the [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Stop motion animation|highest grossing stop motion animated film]] until it was surpassed in 1993 by ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. The movie was shown in cinemas every day of the week for 28 years, from 1975 until 2003\u2014mainly in Norway, Moscow and Tokyo.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} A real ''Il tempo gigante'' car was used to promote the film, e.g. driving around the [[Hockenheimring]] between races.<ref>http://www.caprino.no/e/pages/car.html</ref> The car originally had a 250&nbsp;hp Cadillac engine but when [[Niki Lauda]] saw it he provided them with a 7.6&nbsp;L, 550&nbsp;hp, big-block Chevrolet engine. The car also has an auxiliary jet-engine, but due to EU restrictions the vehicle is barely permitted to be used at all save for exclusive TV cameos.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nThe UK release featured the voice of well-known [[Formula One]] commentator [[Murray Walker]]. There is also a US dubbed version.\n\nThe film was first released on DVD in 2001. In 2005 a digitally restored 30th-anniversary DVD was released which featured soundtracks and subtitles in five languages including English.\n\nThe movie aired every Christmas Eve in Norway for several years, until a change of channel from [[NRK]] to [[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]] changed the airing date to 23 or 25 December. In 2009 it showed on the 25th.\n\nIt was released on 8 May 1980 in [[Cinema of Australia|Australian theaters]] by [[Filmways|Filmways Australia]] and released in US and Canada in 1981.\n\n== Subsequent films based on Aukrust's ''Fl\u00e5klypa'' universe ==\n* ''[[Gurin with the Foxtail]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Solan og Ludvig - Jul i Fl\u00e5klypa]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Solan og Ludvig: Herfra til Fl\u00e5klypa]]'' (2015)\n\n== Other works inspired ==\nIn 2000 a computer game based on the film was released. The game was created by Tyr Neilsen who was Creative Director and in charge of production at Ingames Interactive until a debilitating accident ended his video game career. The project was taken over and completed by Caprino's son Remo, while his grandson Mario was lead programmer. The lead designer was [[Joe Dever]].\nThe game was ported to [[Nintendo DS]] in 2010.\n\nThe movie inspired a young [[Christian von Koenigsegg]] to create the [[Koenigsegg CC]], the first of the [[Koenigsegg]] make of supercars.\n\nNorwegian [[hip-hop]] duo Multicyde based their 1999 single \"Not for the Dough\" on a sample from the movie's soundtrack and featured excerpts from the movie in the song's music video.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/85857/Multicyde-An%C3%A8A-Not-for-the-Dough-Bent-Fabricius-Bjerre-Reodors-Ballade-Aka.-Fl%C3%A5klypa-Theme/ | title=WhoSampled.com entry for Multicyde sample from film's theme | publisher=WhoSampled.com | accessdate=September 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of animated feature films]]\n*[[List of stop-motion films]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Fl\u00e5klypa Grand Prix}}\n* {{IMDb title|0073000|The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix}}\n* {{bcdb title|68170|The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix}}\n* [http://www.caprino.no/en-UK/ Homepage of Caprino Studios] (in English)\n*[http://www.fabricius-bjerre.dk/ Homepage of Bent Fabricius Bjerre] (sound track)\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pinchcliffe Grand Prix}}\n[[Category:1975 animated films]]\n[[Category:Norwegian films]]\n[[Category:Norwegian-language films]]\n[[Category:Norwegian animated films]]\n[[Category:Norwegian children's films]]\n[[Category:Stop-motion animated films]]\n[[Category:Animated sports films]]\n[[Category:Auto racing films]]\n[[Category:Films about automobiles]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ivo Caprino]]", "sha1": "8w40mbbeuz8t1mn47edvn9rubwat6lq"}}, {"title": "Fortran", "ns": "0", "id": "11168", "revision": {"id": "866733977", "parentid": "866484929", "timestamp": "2018-11-01T05:58:21Z", "contributor": {"username": "NickyMcLean", "id": "433669"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Obsolescence and deletions */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n{{Infobox programming language\n| name = Fortran\n| logo = [[File:Fortran acs cover.jpeg|150px]]\n| logo caption = ''The Fortran Automatic Coding System for the [[IBM 704]]'' (15 October 1956), the first programmer's reference manual for Fortran\n| paradigm = [[Multi-paradigm programming language|multi-paradigm]]: [[Structured programming|structured]], [[Imperative programming|imperative]] ([[Procedural programming|procedural]], [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]]), [[Generic programming|generic]]\n| year = {{Start date and age|1957}}\n| designer = [[John Backus]]\n| developer = [[John Backus]] and [[IBM]]\n| latest release version = Fortran 2008 (ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010)\n| latest release date = {{Start date and age|2010}}\n| typing = [[Strong and weak typing|strong]], [[Type system|static]], [[Manifest typing|manifest]]\n| implementations = [[Absoft Fortran Compilers|Absoft]], [[Cray]], [[GNU Fortran|GFortran]], [[G95]], [[IBM]] XL Fortran, [[Intel Fortran Compiler|Intel]], [[Hitachi]], Lahey/Fujitsu, [[Numerical Algorithms Group]], [[Watcom C compiler|Open Watcom]], [[PathScale]], [[PGI compiler|PGI]], [[Silverfrost FTN95|Silverfrost]], [[Oracle Solaris Studio]], Visual Fortran, others\n| dialects = \n| influenced_by = [[Speedcoding]]\n| influenced = [[ALGOL 58]], [[BASIC]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Chapel (programming language)|Chapel]],<ref name=\"chplspec\">{{cite web|title=Chapel spec (Acknowledgements)|url=http://chapel.cray.com/spec/spec-0.98.pdf|date=2015-10-01|accessdate=2016-01-14|publisher=Cray Inc}}</ref> [[CMS-2 (programming language)|CMS-2]], [[Fortress (programming language)|Fortress]], [[PL/I]], [[PACT I]], [[MUMPS]] and [[Ratfor]]\n| operating_system = \n| license = \n| website = \n| file_ext = <code>.f</code>, <code>.for</code>, <code>.f90</code>\n}}\n\n'''Fortran''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|\u0254r|t|r|\u00e6|n}};

The inclusion of a [[complex data type|complex number data type]] in the language made Fortran especially suited to technical applications such as electrical engineering.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nBy 1960, versions of FORTRAN were available for the [[IBM 709]], [[IBM 650|650]], [[IBM 1620|1620]], and [[IBM 7090|7090]] computers.  Significantly, the increasing popularity of FORTRAN spurred competing computer manufacturers to provide FORTRAN compilers for their machines, so that by 1963 over 40 FORTRAN compilers existed.  For these reasons, FORTRAN is considered to be the first widely used <!--[[cross-platform]] is NOT a well-defined term! --> programming language supported across a variety of computer architectures.\n\nThe development of Fortran paralleled the [[History of compiler writing|early evolution of compiler technology]], and many advances in the theory and design of [[compiler]]s were specifically motivated by the need to generate efficient code for Fortran programs.\n\n===FORTRAN===\nThe initial release of FORTRAN for the IBM 704 contained 32 [[Statement (programming)|statements]], including:\n\n* <code>DIMENSION</code> and <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> statements\n* Assignment statements\n* Three-way [[Arithmetic IF|''arithmetic'' <code>IF</code>]] statement, which passed control to one of three locations in the program depending on whether the result of the arithmetic statement was negative, zero, or positive\n* <code>IF</code> statements for checking exceptions (<code>ACCUMULATOR OVERFLOW</code>, <code>QUOTIENT OVERFLOW</code>, and <code>DIVIDE CHECK</code>); and <code>IF</code> statements for manipulating [[front panel|sense switches and sense lights]]\n* <code>GO TO</code>, computed <code>GO TO</code>, <code>ASSIGN</code>, and assigned <code>GO TO</code>\n* <code>DO</code> loops\n* Formatted I/O: <code>FORMAT</code>, <code>READ</code>, <code>READ INPUT TAPE</code>, <code>WRITE</code>, <code>WRITE OUTPUT TAPE</code>, <code>PRINT</code>, and <code>PUNCH</code>\n* Unformatted I/O: <code>READ TAPE</code>, <code>READ DRUM</code>, <code>WRITE TAPE</code>, and <code>WRITE DRUM</code>\n* Other I/O: <code>END FILE</code>, <code>REWIND</code>, and <code>BACKSPACE</code>\n* <code>PAUSE</code>, <code>STOP</code>, and <code>CONTINUE</code>\n* <code>FREQUENCY</code> statement (for providing [[optimization (computer science)|optimization]] hints to the compiler).\n\nThe arithmetic <code>IF</code> statement was reminiscent of (but not readily implementable by) a three-way comparison instruction (CAS{{snd}} Compare Accumulator with Storage) available on the 704. The statement provided the only way to compare numbers{{snd}} by testing their difference, with an attendant risk of overflow. This deficiency was later overcome by \"logical\" facilities introduced in FORTRAN IV.\n\nThe <code>FREQUENCY</code> statement was used originally (and optionally) to give branch probabilities for the three branch cases of the arithmetic IF statement. The first FORTRAN compiler used this weighting to perform ''at compile time'' a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation]] of the generated code, the results of which were used to optimize the placement of basic blocks in memory{{snd}} a very sophisticated optimization for its time. The Monte Carlo technique is documented in Backus et al.'s paper on this original implementation, ''The FORTRAN Automatic Coding System'':\n\n<blockquote>\nThe fundamental unit of program is the [[basic block]]; a basic block is a stretch of program which has one entry point and one exit point. The purpose of section 4 is to prepare for section 5 a table of predecessors (PRED table) which enumerates the basic blocks and lists for every basic block each of the basic blocks which can be its immediate predecessor in flow, together with the absolute frequency of each such basic block link. This table is obtained by running the program once in Monte-Carlo fashion, in which the outcome of conditional transfers arising out of IF-type statements and computed GO TO's is determined by a random number generator suitably weighted according to whatever FREQUENCY statements have been provided.<ref name=\"Backus57\">{{Cite journal |last=Backus |first=J.

Punched card codes included no lower-case letters or many special characters, and special versions of the IBM 026 [[keypunch]] were offered that would correctly print the re-purposed special characters used in FORTRAN.\n\nReflecting punched card input practice, Fortran programs were originally written in a fixed-column format, with the first 72 columns read into twelve 36-bit words.\n\nA letter \"C\" in column 1 caused the entire card to be treated as a comment and ignored by the compiler. Otherwise, the columns of the card were divided into four fields:\n* 1 to 5 were the label field: a sequence of digits here was taken as a label for use in DO or control statements such as GO TO and IF, or to identify a FORMAT statement referred to in a WRITE or READ statement. Leading zeros are ignored and 0 is not a valid label number. \n* 6 was a continuation field: a character other than a blank or a zero here caused the card to be taken as a continuation of the statement on the prior card. The continuation cards were usually numbered 1, 2, ''etc.'' and the starting card might therefore have zero in its continuation column \u2013 which is not a continuation of its preceding card. \n* 7 to 72 served as the statement field. \n* 73 to 80 were ignored (the IBM 704's [[IBM 711|card reader]] only used 72 columns).<ref>[http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/7090/22-6528-4_7090Manual.pdf Reference Manual, IBM 7090 Data Processing System], 1961, IBM A22-6528-3.</ref>\n\nColumns 73 to 80 could therefore be used for identification information, such as punching a sequence number or text, which could be used to re-order cards if a stack of cards was dropped; though in practice this was reserved for stable, production programs. An [[IBM 519]] could be used to copy a program deck and add sequence numbers. Some early compilers, e.g., the IBM 650's, had additional restrictions due to limitations on their card readers.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/fortran/F28-8074-3_FORTRANII_GenInf.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Bitsavers.org |title=Fortran II User Manual |accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> [[Keypunch]]es could be programmed to tab to column 7 and skip out after column 72. Later compilers relaxed most fixed-format restrictions, and the requirement was eliminated in the Fortran 90 standard.\n\nWithin the statement field, [[whitespace character]]s (blanks) were ignored outside a text literal. This allowed omitting spaces between tokens for brevity or including spaces within identifiers for clarity. For example, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\" inline>AVG OF X</syntaxhighlight> was a valid identifier, equivalent to <syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\" inline>AVGOFX</syntaxhighlight>, and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\" inline>101010DO101I=1,101</syntaxhighlight> was a valid statement, equivalent to \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortranfixed\" inline>10101    DO 101   I = 1, 101</syntaxhighlight> because the zero in column 6 is treated as if it were a space (!), while <syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\" inline>101010DO101I=1.101</syntaxhighlight> was instead <syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortranfixed\" inline>10101    DO101I = 1.101</syntaxhighlight>, the assignment of 1.101 to a variable called <syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\" inline>DO101I</syntaxhighlight>. Note the slight visual difference between a comma and a period.\n\n[[Hollerith constant|Hollerith strings]], originally allowed only in FORMAT and DATA statements, were prefixed by a character count and the letter H (e.g., <syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\" inline>26HTHIS IS ALPHANUMERIC DATA.</syntaxhighlight>), allowing blanks to be retained within the character string. Miscounts were a problem.\n\n===FORTRAN II===\nIBM's ''FORTRAN II'' appeared in 1958.  The main enhancement was to support [[procedural programming]] by allowing user-written subroutines and functions which returned values, with parameters passed by [[Call by reference#Call by reference|reference]].  The COMMON statement provided a way for subroutines to access common (or [[global variable|global]]) variables. Six new statements were introduced:<ref>{{cite manual|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/704/C28-6000-2_704_FORTRANII.pdf|title=Reference Manual, FORTRAN II for the IBM 704 Data Processing System|year=1958|id=C28-6000-2}}</ref>\n\n* <code>SUBROUTINE</code>, <code>FUNCTION</code>, and <code>END</code>\n* <code>CALL</code> and <code>RETURN</code>\n* <code>COMMON</code>\n\nOver the next few years, FORTRAN II would also add support for the <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code> and <code>COMPLEX</code> data types.\n\nEarly FORTRAN compilers supported no [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]] in subroutines. Early computer architectures supported no concept of a stack, and when they did directly support subroutine calls, the return location was often stored in one fixed location adjacent to the subroutine code (e.g. the [[IBM 1130]]) or a specific machine register ([[IBM 360]] ''et seq''), which only allows recursion if a stack is maintained by software and the return address is stored on the stack before the call is made and restored after the call returns. Although not specified in FORTRAN 77, many F77 compilers supported recursion as an option, and the [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs mainframes]], designed with recursion built-in, did so by default. It became a standard in Fortran 90 via the new keyword RECURSIVE.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/languages/fortran/ch1-12.html |title=Ibibilio.org |publisher=Ibiblio.org |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Simple FORTRAN II program====\nThis program, for [[Heron's formula]], reads data on a tape reel containing three 5-digit integers A, B, and C as input. There are no \"type\" declarations available: variables whose name starts with I, J, K, L, M, or N are \"fixed-point\" (i.e. integers), otherwise floating-point. Since integers are to be processed in this example, the names of the variables start with the letter \"I\". The name of a variable must start with a letter and can continue with both letters and digits, up to a limit of six characters in FORTRAN II.  If A, B, and C cannot represent the sides of a triangle in plane geometry, then the program's execution will end with an error code of \"STOP 1\".  Otherwise, an output line will be printed showing the input values for A, B, and C, followed by the computed AREA of the triangle as a floating-point number occupying ten spaces along the line of output and showing 2 digits after the decimal point, the .2 in F10.2 of the FORMAT statement with label 601.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortranfixed\">\nC AREA OF A TRIANGLE WITH A STANDARD SQUARE ROOT FUNCTION\nC INPUT - TAPE READER UNIT 5, INTEGER INPUT\nC OUTPUT - LINE PRINTER UNIT 6, REAL OUTPUT\nC INPUT ERROR DISPLAY ERROR OUTPUT CODE 1 IN JOB CONTROL LISTING\n      READ INPUT TAPE 5, 501, IA, IB, IC\n  501 FORMAT (3I5)\nC IA, IB, AND IC MAY NOT BE NEGATIVE OR ZERO\nC FURTHERMORE, THE SUM OF TWO SIDES OF A TRIANGLE\nC MUST BE GREATER THAN THE THIRD SIDE, SO WE CHECK FOR THAT, TOO\n      IF (IA) 777, 777, 701\n  701 IF (IB) 777, 777, 702\n  702 IF (IC) 777, 777, 703\n  703 IF (IA+IB-IC) 777, 777, 704\n  704 IF (IA+IC-IB) 777, 777, 705\n  705 IF (IB+IC-IA) 777, 777, 799\n  777 STOP 1\nC USING HERON'S FORMULA WE CALCULATE THE\nC AREA OF THE TRIANGLE\n  799 S = FLOATF (IA + IB + IC) / 2.0\n      AREA = SQRTF( S * (S - FLOATF(IA)) * (S - FLOATF(IB)) *\n     +     (S - FLOATF(IC)))\n      WRITE OUTPUT TAPE 6, 601, IA, IB, IC, AREA\n  601 FORMAT (4H A= ,I5,5H  B= ,I5,5H  C= ,I5,8H  AREA= ,F10.2,\n     +        13H SQUARE UNITS)\n      STOP\n      END\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===FORTRAN III===\n[[File:FortranCodingForm.png|thumb|right|300px|A FORTRAN coding form, printed on paper and intended to be used by programmers to prepare programs for punching onto cards by [[keypunch]] operators.

Like the 704 FORTRAN and FORTRAN II, FORTRAN III included machine-dependent features that made code written in it unportable from machine to machine.<ref name=\"history-fortran-i-ii-333\"/>{{rp|76}}  Early versions of FORTRAN provided by other vendors suffered from the same disadvantage.\n\n===IBM 1401 FORTRAN===\nFORTRAN was provided for the [[IBM 1401]] computer by an innovative 63-phase compiler that ran entirely in its [[Magnetic core memory|core memory]] of only 8000 (six-bit) characters.  The compiler could be run from tape, or from a 2200-card deck; it used no further tape or disk storage.  It kept the program in memory and loaded [[Overlay (programming)|overlays]] that gradually transformed it, in place, into executable form, as described by Haines.<ref>{{cite journal\n| first = L.

FORTRAN IV was eventually released in 1962, first for the [[IBM 7030 Stretch|IBM 7030]] (\"Stretch\") computer, followed by versions for the [[IBM 7090]], [[IBM 7090|IBM 7094]], and later for the [[IBM 1401]] in 1966.\n\nBy 1965, FORTRAN IV was supposed to be compliant with the ''standard'' being developed by the [[American National Standards Institute|American Standards Association]] X3.4.3 FORTRAN Working Group.<ref name=\"McCracken\">{{cite book|last=McCracken|first=Daniel D.|title=A Guide to FORTRAN IV Programming|year=1965|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0-471-58281-6|page=v|chapter=Preface}}</ref>\n\nAt about this time FORTRAN IV had started to become an important educational tool and implementations such as the University of Waterloo's WATFOR and [[WATFIV]] were created to simplify the complex compile and link processes of earlier compilers.\n\n===FORTRAN 66===\nPerhaps the most significant development in the early history of FORTRAN was the decision by the ''American Standards Association'' (now [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI)) to form a committee sponsored by BEMA, the Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, to develop an ''American Standard Fortran''.  The resulting two standards, approved in March 1966, defined two languages, ''FORTRAN'' (based on FORTRAN IV, which had served as a de facto standard), and ''Basic FORTRAN'' (based on FORTRAN II, but stripped of its machine-dependent features).  The FORTRAN defined by the first standard, officially denoted X3.9-1966, became known as ''FORTRAN 66'' (although many continued to term it FORTRAN IV, the language on which the standard was largely based).  FORTRAN 66 effectively became the first industry-standard version of FORTRAN. FORTRAN 66 included:\n\n* Main program, <code>SUBROUTINE</code>, <code>FUNCTION</code>, and <code>BLOCK DATA</code> program units\n* <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>REAL</code>, <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code>, <code>COMPLEX</code>, and <code>LOGICAL</code> [[data type]]s\n* <code>COMMON</code>, <code>DIMENSION</code>, and <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> statements\n* <code>DATA</code> statement for specifying initial values\n* [[Intrinsic function|Intrinsic]] and <code>EXTERNAL</code> (e.g., library) functions\n* Assignment statement\n* <code>GO TO</code>, computed <code>GO TO</code>, assigned <code>GO TO</code>, and <code>ASSIGN</code> statements\n* Logical <code>IF</code> and arithmetic (three-way) <code>IF</code> statements\n* <code>DO</code> loop statement\n* <code>READ</code>, <code>WRITE</code>, <code>BACKSPACE</code>, <code>REWIND</code>, and <code>ENDFILE</code> statements for sequential I/O\n* <code>FORMAT</code> statement and assigned format\n* <code>CALL</code>, <code>RETURN</code>, <code>PAUSE</code>, and <code>STOP</code> statements\n* [[Hollerith constant]]s in <code>DATA</code> and <code>FORMAT</code> statements, and as arguments to procedures\n* Identifiers of up to six characters in length\n* Comment lines\n* <code>END</code> line\n\n===FORTRAN 77===\n[[File:Ftn-elim-1240x1709.jpg|thumb|FORTRAN-77 program with compiler output, written on a\n[[Control Data Corporation|CDC]] [[CDC Cyber|175]] at [[RWTH Aachen University]], Germany, in 1987]]\n[[File:4.3 BSD UWisc VAX Emulation f77 Manual.png|thumb|[[4.3BSD|4.3 BSD]] for the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) [[VAX]], displaying the [[man page|manual]] for FORTRAN 77 (f77) compiler]]\nAfter the release of the FORTRAN 66 standard, compiler vendors introduced several extensions to ''Standard Fortran'', prompting ANSI committee X3J3 in 1969 to begin work on revising the 1966 standard, under sponsorship of [[CBEMA]], the Computer Business Equipment Manufacturers Association (formerly BEMA).  Final drafts of this revised standard circulated in 1977, leading to formal approval of the new FORTRAN standard in April 1978.  The new standard, called ''FORTRAN 77'' and officially denoted X3.9-1978, added a number of significant features to address many of the shortcomings of FORTRAN 66:\n\n* Block <code>IF</code> and <code>END IF</code> statements, with optional <code>ELSE</code> and <code>ELSE IF</code> clauses, to provide improved language support for [[structured programming]]\n* <code>DO</code> loop extensions, including parameter expressions, negative increments, and zero trip counts\n* <code>OPEN</code>, <code>CLOSE</code>, and <code>INQUIRE</code> statements for improved I/O capability\n* Direct-access file I/O\n* <code>IMPLICIT</code> statement, to override implicit conventions that undeclared variables are INTEGER if their name begins with I, J, K, L, M, or N (and REAL otherwise)\n* <code>CHARACTER</code> data type, replacing Hollerith strings with vastly expanded facilities for character input and output and processing of character-based data\n* <code>PARAMETER</code> statement for specifying constants\n* <code>SAVE</code> statement for persistent local variables\n* Generic names for intrinsic functions (e.g. <code>SQRT</code> also accepts arguments of other types, such as <code>COMPLEX</code> or <code>REAL*16</code> ).\n* A set of intrinsics (<CODE>LGE, LGT, LLE, LLT</CODE>) for <U>lexical</U> comparison of strings, based upon the [[ASCII]] [[collating sequence]]. (These ASCII functions were demanded by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], in their conditional approval vote.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}})\n\nIn this revision of the standard, a number of features were removed or altered in a manner that might invalidate formerly standard-conforming programs.\n''(Removal was the only allowable alternative to X3J3 at that time, since the concept of \"[[deprecation]]\" was not yet available for ANSI standards.)''\nWhile most of the 24 items in the conflict list (see Appendix A2 of X3.9-1978) addressed loopholes or pathological cases permitted by the prior standard but rarely used, a small number of specific capabilities were deliberately removed, such as:\n\n* [[Hollerith constant]]s and [[Herman Hollerith|Hollerith]] data, such as <syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\" inline>      GREET = 12HHELLO THERE!</syntaxhighlight>\n* Reading into an H edit (Hollerith field) descriptor in a FORMAT specification\n* Overindexing of array bounds by subscripts <syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortranfixed\">\n      DIMENSION A(10,5)\n      Y=  A(11,1)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n* Transfer of control out of and back into the range of a DO loop (also known as \"Extended Range\")\n\n====Variants: Minnesota FORTRAN====\n[[Control Data Corporation]] computers had another version of FORTRAN 77, called Minnesota FORTRAN (MNF), designed especially for student use, with variations in output constructs, special uses of COMMONs and DATA statements, optimizations code levels for compiling, and detailed error listings, extensive warning messages, and debugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acd/literature/reports/p008.htm|title=FORTRAN Compilers and Loaders|publisher=Chilton-programming.org.uk|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Transition to ANSI Standard Fortran===\nThe development of a revised standard to succeed FORTRAN 77 would be repeatedly delayed as the standardization process struggled to keep up with rapid changes in computing and programming practice.  In the meantime, as the \"Standard FORTRAN\" for nearly fifteen years, FORTRAN 77 would become the historically most important dialect.\n\nAn important practical extension to FORTRAN 77 was the release of MIL-STD-1753 in 1978.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Mil-std-1753\n  | title = DoD Supplement to X3.9-1978\n  | publisher = [[United States Government Printing Office]]\n  | url = http://www.fortran.com/fortran/mil_std_1753.html\n  }}</ref> This specification, developed by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], standardized a number of features implemented by most FORTRAN 77 compilers but not included in the ANSI FORTRAN 77 standard.

In addition to changing the official spelling from FORTRAN to Fortran, this major revision added many new features to reflect the significant changes in programming practice that had evolved since the 1978 standard:\n\n* [[free-form language|Free-form source input]], also with lowercase Fortran keywords\n* Identifiers up to 31 characters in length (In the previous standard, it was only six characters).\n* Inline comments\n* Ability to operate on arrays (or array sections) as a whole, thus greatly simplifying math and engineering computations.\n** whole, partial and masked array assignment statements and array expressions, such as &nbsp; <CODE> X(1:N)=R(1:N)*COS(A(1:N)) </CODE>\n** <code>WHERE</code> statement for selective array assignment\n** array-valued constants and expressions,\n** user-defined array-valued functions and array constructors.\n* [[recursion (computer science)|<code>RECURSIVE</code>]] procedures\n* [[Modular programming|Modules]], to group related [[Subroutine|procedures]] and data together, and make them available to other program units, including the capability to limit the accessibility to only specific parts of the module.\n* A vastly improved argument-passing mechanism, allowing [[type signature|interfaces]] to be checked at compile time\n* User-written interfaces for generic procedures\n* [[Operator overloading]]\n* Derived (structured) data types\n* New data type declaration syntax, to specify the data type and other attributes of variables\n* [[Dynamic memory allocation]] by means of the <code>ALLOCATABLE</code> attribute and the <code>ALLOCATE</code> and <code>DEALLOCATE</code> statements\n* [[Pointer (computer programming)|<code>POINTER</code>]] attribute, pointer assignment, and <code>NULLIFY</code> statement to facilitate the creation and manipulation of dynamic [[data structure]]s\n* Structured looping constructs, with an <CODE>END DO</CODE> statement for loop termination, and <code>EXIT</code> and <code>CYCLE</code> statements for terminating normal <code>DO</code> loop iterations in an orderly way\n* <code>SELECT</code> . . . <code>CASE</code> construct for multi-way selection\n* Portable specification of numerical precision under the user's control\n* New and enhanced intrinsic procedures.\n\n====Obsolescence and deletions====\nUnlike the prior revision, Fortran 90 removed no features. ''(Appendix B.1 says, \"The list of deleted features in this standard is empty.\")'' Any standard-conforming FORTRAN 77 program is also standard-conforming under Fortran 90, and either standard should be usable to define its behavior.\n\nA small set of features were identified as \"obsolescent\" and expected to be removed in a future standard.  All of the functionalities of these early version features are performed by new Fortran 95 features.  Some are kept to simplify porting of old programs but may eventually be deleted.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Obsolescent feature\n! Example\n!

Nevertheless, Fortran 95 also added a number of extensions, notably from the [[High Performance Fortran]] specification:\n\n* <code>FORALL</code> and nested <code>WHERE</code> constructs to aid vectorization\n* User-defined <code>PURE</code> and <code>ELEMENTAL</code> procedures\n* Default initialization of derived type components, including pointer initialization\n* Expanded the ability to use initialization expressions for data objects\n* Initialization of pointers to <code>NULL()</code>\n* Clearly defined that <code>ALLOCATABLE</code> arrays are automatically deallocated when they go out of scope.\n\nA number of intrinsic functions were extended (for example a <code>dim</code> argument was added to the <code>maxloc</code> intrinsic).\n\nSeveral features noted in Fortran 90 to be \"obsolescent\" were removed from Fortran 95:\n\n* <code>DO</code> statements using <code>REAL</code> and <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code> index variables\n* Branching to an <code>END IF</code> statement from outside its block\n* <code>PAUSE</code> statement\n* <code>ASSIGN</code> and assigned <code>GO TO</code> statement, and assigned format specifiers\n* <code>H</code> edit descriptor.\n\nAn important supplement to Fortran 95 was the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO technical report]] ''TR-15581: Enhanced Data Type Facilities'', informally known as the ''Allocatable TR.''  This specification defined enhanced use of <code>ALLOCATABLE</code> arrays, prior to the availability of fully Fortran 2003-compliant Fortran compilers.  Such uses include <code>ALLOCATABLE</code> arrays as derived type components, in procedure dummy argument lists, and as function return values.  (<code>ALLOCATABLE</code> arrays are preferable to <code>POINTER</code>-based arrays because <code>ALLOCATABLE</code> arrays are guaranteed by Fortran 95 to be deallocated automatically when they go out of scope, eliminating the possibility of [[memory leak]]age.  In addition, elements of allocatable arrays are contiguous, and [[aliasing (computing)|aliasing]] is not an issue for optimization of array references, allowing compilers to generate faster code than in the case of pointers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fortran 95 Reference|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.0/gfortran/|publisher=Gnu.Org|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref>)\n\nAnother important supplement to Fortran 95 was the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] technical report ''TR-15580: Floating-point exception handling'', informally known as the ''IEEE TR.''  This specification defined support for [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE floating-point arithmetic]] and [[floating point]] [[exception handling]].\n\n====Conditional compilation and varying length strings====\nIn addition to the mandatory \"Base language\"\n(defined in ISO/IEC 1539-1 : 1997),\nthe Fortran 95 language also includes two optional modules:\n* Varying length character strings (ISO/IEC 1539-2 : 2000)\n* Conditional compilation (ISO/IEC 1539-3 : 1998)\nwhich, together, compose the multi-part International Standard (ISO/IEC 1539).\n\nAccording to the standards developers, \"the optional parts describe self-contained features which have been requested by a substantial body of users and/or implementors, but which are not deemed to be of sufficient generality for them to be required in all standard-conforming Fortran compilers.\" Nevertheless, if a standard-conforming Fortran does provide such options, then they \"must be provided in accordance with the description of those facilities in the appropriate Part of the Standard\".\n\n===Fortran 2003===\n''Fortran 2003,'' officially published as ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004, is a major revision introducing many new features.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fortran 2003\u2013 Last Working Draft|url=http://www.j3-fortran.org/doc/year/04/04-007.txt|publisher=Gnu.Org|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> A comprehensive summary of the new features of Fortran 2003 is available at the Fortran Working Group (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5) official Web site.<ref>[http://www.nag.co.uk/sc22wg5/ Fortran Working Group (WG5)].

This report provided ''sub-modules,'' which make Fortran modules more similar to [[Modula-2]] modules.  They are similar to [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] private child sub-units.  This allows the specification and implementation of a module to be expressed in separate program units, which improves packaging of large libraries, allows preservation of trade secrets while publishing definitive interfaces, and prevents compilation cascades.\n\n===Fortran 2008===\nThe most recent standard, ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010, informally known as Fortran 2008, was approved in September 2010.<ref>N1836, Summary of Voting/Table of Replies on ISO/IEC FDIS 1539-1, Information technology \u2013 Programming languages \u2013 Fortran \u2013 Part 1: Base language [https://wg5-fortran.org/N1801-N1850/N1836.pdf]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fortran 2008 \u2013 Last Working Draft|url=http://www.j3-fortran.org/doc/year/10/10-007.pdf|publisher=Gnu.Org|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref>   As with Fortran 95, this is a minor upgrade, incorporating clarifications and corrections to Fortran 2003, as well as introducing a select few new capabilities.

Many of the floating-point benchmarks to gauge the performance of new computer processors, such as [http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/CFP2006/ CFP2006], the floating-point component of the [[Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation|SPEC]] [http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/ CPU2006] benchmarks, are written in Fortran.\n\nApart from this, more modern codes in computational science generally use large program libraries, such as [[METIS]] for graph partitioning, [[PETSc]] or [[Trilinos]] for linear algebra capabilities, [[Dune (software)|DUNE]] or [[FEniCS Project|FEniCS]] for mesh and finite element support, and other generic libraries.  Since the late 1990s, almost all of the most widely used support libraries have been written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and, more often, [[C++]]. On the other hand, high-level languages such as [[Matlab]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], or [[R (programming language)|R]] are becoming popular in particular areas of computational science. Consequently, a growing fraction of scientific programs are also written in these languages.  For this reason, [[foreign function interface|facilities for inter-operation with C]] were added to Fortran 2003 and enhanced by ISO/IEC technical specification 29113, which will be incorporated into Fortran 2018. This shift in the popularity of programming languages is also evident in the selection of applications between the [[SPECfp#Benchmarks 2|SPEC CPU 2000]] and [[SPECfp#Benchmarks|SPEC CPU 2006]] floating point benchmarks.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nSoftware for NASA probes [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] was originally written in FORTRAN 5, and later ported to FORTRAN 77.  {{as of|2013|9|25}}, some of the software is still written in Fortran and some has been ported to C.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Interstellar 8-Track: How Voyager's Vintage Tech Keeps Running| work = WIRED| accessdate = 2017-12-23| url = https://www.wired.com/2013/09/vintage-voyager-probes/}}</ref>\n\n==Language features==\n{{expand section|date=January 2018}}\nThe precise characteristics and syntax of Fortran 95 are discussed in [[Fortran 95 language features]].\n\n==Portability==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\n[[Portability (computer science)|Portability]] was a problem in the early days because there was no agreed upon standard{{snd}} not even IBM's reference manual{{snd}} and computer companies vied to differentiate their offerings from others by providing incompatible features.  Standards have improved portability.  The 1966 standard provided a reference [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] and semantics, but vendors continued to provide incompatible extensions.  Although careful programmers were coming to realize that use of incompatible extensions caused expensive portability problems, and were therefore using programs such as ''The PFORT Verifier,'' it was not until after the 1977 standard, when the National Bureau of Standards (now [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]) published ''FIPS PUB 69'', that processors purchased by the U.S. Government were required to diagnose extensions of the standard.  Rather than offer two processors, essentially every compiler eventually had at least an option to diagnose extensions.\n\nIncompatible extensions were not the only portability problem.  For numerical calculations, it is important to take account of the characteristics of the arithmetic.  This was addressed by Fox et al. in the context of the 1966 standard by the ''PORT'' library.  The ideas therein became widely used, and were eventually incorporated into the 1990 standard by way of intrinsic inquiry functions.  The widespread (now almost universal) adoption of the [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE 754]] standard for binary floating-point arithmetic has essentially removed this problem.\n\nAccess to the computing environment (e.g., the program's command line, environment variables, textual explanation of error conditions) remained a problem until it was addressed by the 2003 standard.\n\nLarge collections of library software that could be described as being loosely related to engineering and scientific calculations, such as graphics libraries, have been written in C, and therefore access to them presented a portability problem.  This has been addressed by incorporation of C interoperability into the 2003 standard.\n\nIt is now possible (and relatively easy) to write an entirely portable program in Fortran, even without recourse to a preprocessor.\n\n==Variants==\n\n===Fortran 5===\nFortran 5 was marketed by [[Data General]] Corp in the late 1970s and early 1980s, for the [[Data General Nova|Nova]], [[Data General Eclipse|Eclipse]], and [[Data General Eclipse MV/8000|MV]] line of computers.  It had an optimizing compiler that was quite good for minicomputers of its time.  The language most closely resembles FORTRAN 66.  The name is a [[pun]] on the earlier FORTRAN IV.\n\n===FORTRAN V===\nFORTRAN V was distributed by [[Control Data Corporation]] in 1968 for the [[CDC 6600]] series. The language was based upon FORTRAN IV.<ref name=\"FIV\">{{cite web|url=http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=1092&language=CDC%20Fortran|title=Towards FORTRAN VI|last=Healy|first=MJR|year=1968|work=Advanced scientific Fortran by CDC|publisher=CDC|pages=169\u2013172|accessdate=10 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705035806/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=1092&language=CDC%20Fortran|archive-date=5 July 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nUnivac also offered a compiler for the 1100 series known as FORTRAN V.

For example, one of IBM's FORTRAN compilers (''H Extended IUP'') had a level of optimization which reordered the [[machine code]] [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] to keep multiple internal arithmetic units busy simultaneously.  Another example is ''CFD'', a special variant of FORTRAN designed specifically for the [[ILLIAC IV]] supercomputer, running at [[NASA]]'s [[NASA Ames Research Center|Ames Research Center]].\nIBM Research Labs also developed an extended FORTRAN-based language called ''VECTRAN'' for processing vectors and matrices.\n\n[[Object-Oriented Fortran]] was an object-oriented extension of Fortran, in which data items can be grouped into objects, which can be instantiated and executed in parallel.  It was available for Sun, Iris, [[Intel iPSC|iPSC]], and nCUBE, but is no longer supported.\n\nSuch machine-specific extensions have either disappeared over time or have had elements incorporated into the main standards. The major remaining extension is [[OpenMP]], which is a cross-platform extension for shared memory programming.  One new extension, Coarray Fortran, is intended to support parallel programming.\n\n====FOR TRANSIT for the IBM 650====\n''FOR TRANSIT'' was the name of a reduced version of the IBM 704 FORTRAN language,\nwhich was implemented for the IBM 650, using a translator program developed\nat Carnegie in the late 1950s.<ref>\"Internal Translator (IT) A Compiler for the IBM 650\",\nby A. J. Perlis, J. W. Smith, and H. R. Van Zoeren, Computation Center,\nCarnegie Institute of Technology\n</ref>\nThe following comment appears in the IBM Reference Manual (''FOR TRANSIT Automatic Coding System'' C28-4038, Copyright 1957, 1959 by IBM):\n<blockquote>The FORTRAN system was designed for a more complex machine than the 650, and consequently some of the 32 statements found in the FORTRAN Programmer's Reference Manual are not acceptable to the FOR TRANSIT system.  In addition, certain restrictions to the FORTRAN language have been added.  However, none of these restrictions make a source program written for FOR TRANSIT incompatible with the FORTRAN system for the 704.</blockquote>\n\nThe permissible statements were:\n\n* Arithmetic assignment statements, e.g., {{code|1=a = b}}\n* {{code|GO to n}}\n* <code>GO TO (n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, ..., n<sub>m</sub>), i</code>\n* <code>IF (a) n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, n<sub>3</sub></code>\n* {{code|PAUSE}}\n* {{code|STOP}}\n* <code>DO n i = m1, m2</code>\n* {{code|CONTINUE}}\n* {{code|END}}\n* {{code|READ n, list}}\n* {{code|PUNCH n, list}}\n* {{code|DIMENSION V, V, V, ...}}\n* {{code|EQUIVALENCE (a,b,c), (d,c), ...}}\n\nUp to ten subroutines could be used in one program.\n\nFOR TRANSIT statements were limited to columns 7 through 56, only.\nPunched cards were used for input and output on the IBM 650.  Three passes were required to translate source code to the \"IT\" language, then to compile the IT statements into SOAP assembly language, and finally to produce the object program, which could then be loaded into the machine to run the program (using punched cards for data input, and outputting results onto punched cards).\n\nTwo versions existed for the 650s with a 2000 word memory drum:  FOR TRANSIT I (S) and FOR TRANSIT II, the latter for machines equipped with indexing registers and automatic floating point decimal ([[Bi-quinary coded decimal|bi-quinary]]) arithmetic.  Appendix A of the manual included wiring diagrams for the [[IBM 533]] card reader/punch [[plugboard|control panel]].\n\n===Fortran-based languages===\nPrior to FORTRAN 77, a number of [[preprocessor]]s were commonly used to provide a friendlier language, with the advantage that the preprocessed code could be compiled on any machine with a standard FORTRAN compiler.  These preprocessors would typically support [[structured programming]], variable names longer than six characters, additional data types, [[conditional compilation]], and even [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] capabilities.  Popular preprocessors included [[FLECS]], [[iftran]], [[Mortran|MORTRAN]], [[SFtran]], [[S-Fortran]], [[Ratfor]], and [[Ratfiv]].  Ratfor and Ratfiv, for example, implemented a [[C (programming language)|C]]-like language, outputting preprocessed code in standard FORTRAN 66.  Despite advances in the Fortran language, preprocessors continue to be used for conditional compilation and macro substitution.\n\nOne of the earliest versions of FORTRAN, introduced in the '60s, was popularly used in colleges and universities.  Developed, supported, and distributed by the [[University of Waterloo]], [[WATFIV|WATFOR]] was based largely on FORTRAN IV.  A student using WATFOR could submit their batch FORTRAN job and, if there were no syntax errors, the program would move straight to execution.  This simplification allowed students to concentrate on their program's syntax and semantics, or execution logic flow, rather than dealing with submission [[Job Control Language]] (JCL), the compile/link-edit/execution successive process(es), or other complexities of the mainframe/minicomputer environment.  A down side to this simplified environment was that WATFOR was not a good choice for programmers needing the expanded abilities of their host processor(s), e.g., WATFOR typically had very limited access to I/O devices. WATFOR was succeeded by [[WATFIV]] and its later versions.\n\n{{sxhl|2=fortran|1=program; s=0 i=1,n;  s=s+1;  stop i;  s='s'  Stop}}  (line programming)\n\n[[LRLTRAN]] was developed at the [[Lawrence Radiation Laboratory]] to provide support for vector arithmetic and dynamic storage, among other extensions to support systems programming.  The distribution included the [[LTSS operating system]].\n\nThe Fortran-95 Standard includes an optional ''Part 3'' which defines an optional [[conditional compilation]] capability.  This capability is often referred to as \"CoCo\".\n\nMany Fortran compilers have integrated subsets of the [[C preprocessor]] into their systems.\n\n[[SIMSCRIPT]] is an application specific Fortran preprocessor for modeling and simulating large discrete systems.\n\nThe [[F (programming language)|F programming language]] was designed to be a clean subset of Fortran 95 that attempted to remove the redundant, unstructured, and deprecated features of Fortran, such as the <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> statement.  F retains the array features added in Fortran 90, and removes control statements that were made obsolete by structured programming constructs added to both FORTRAN 77 and Fortran 90.  F is described by its creators as \"a compiled, structured, array programming language especially well suited to education and scientific computing\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fortran.com/F/index.html | title= F Programming Language Homepage|publisher=Fortran.com|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nLahey and Fujitsu teamed up to create Fortran for the Microsoft [[.NET Framework]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lahey.com/lf71/lfnet.htm | title=Fortran for .NET Language System | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018201259/http://www.lahey.com/lf71/lfnet.htm | archivedate=18 October 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Silverfrost FTN95 is also capable of creating .NET code.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.silverfrost.com/11/ftn95_overview.aspx | title=FTN95: Fortran 95 for Windows|publisher=Silverfrost.com|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Code examples==\n{{details|Wikibooks:Fortran/Fortran examples}}\nThe following program illustrates dynamic memory allocation and array-based operations, two features introduced with Fortran 90.  Particularly noteworthy is the absence of <code>DO</code> loops and <code>IF</code>/<code>THEN</code> statements in manipulating the array; mathematical operations are applied to the array as a whole.  Also apparent is the use of descriptive variable names and general code formatting that conform with contemporary programming style.

This proposal purported to address the confusion that sometimes arises between the letter \"O\" and the numeral zero, by eliminating the letter from allowable variable names.  However, the method proposed was to eliminate the letter from the character set entirely (thereby retaining 48 as the number of lexical characters, which the colon had increased to 49).  This was considered beneficial in that it would promote structured programming, by making it impossible to use the notorious <CODE>'''GO TO'''</CODE> statement as before.

Located 2285&nbsp;km (1420 miles) from [[Bras\u00edlia|Brasilia]], the federal capital, the city has developed on the banks of the creek Paje\u00fa, and its name is an allusion to [[Fort Schoonenborch]], which gave rise to the city, built by the Dutch during their second stay in the area between 1649 and 1654. The [[motto]] of Fortaleza, present in its [[coat of arms]] is the [[Latin]] word ''Fortitudine'', which means \"with strength/courage\".\n\nIn 2013, Fortaleza was the twelfth richest city in the country in GDP and second in the Northeast, with 49 billion reais (US$21 billion). It also has the third richest metropolitan area in the North and Northeast regions. It is an important industrial and commercial center of Brazil, the eighth nation's largest municipal purchasing power. According to the [[Ministry of Tourism (Brazil)|Ministry of Tourism]], the city reached the marks of second most desired destination of Brazil and fourth Brazilian city that receives more tourists. The [[BR-116]], the most important highway of the country, starts in Fortaleza.

With the transformation of the city into a regional export center and with the increase of direct navigation to [[Europe]], the customs building of Fortaleza was built in 1812. Silva Paulet played an important role in the structural evolution of the city, erecting works like the ''Fortaleza de Nossa Senhora da Assun\u00e7\u00e3o'' (Fortress of Our Lady of the Assumption) in 1812, in the place of what remained of the old fort, and the public promenade in 1820, besides having been the author of the first urban plan of the city, also in 1812. In 1824, the city was targeted by the revolutionaries of [[Confederation of the Equator]]. Especially in the second half of the century, as a result of the fertile [[cotton]] era, the city was seized by a great period of urban development and construction of remarkable equipment, such as the ''Lyceum of Cear\u00e1'' and the Lighthouse of [[Mucuripe]] in 1845, [[Santa Casa de Miseric\u00f3rdia]] in 1861, the Prainha Seminary in 1864, the water supply system in 1866, the public library in 1867, the public prison in 1870, the Cear\u00e1 Railroad Network, the Fortaleza port on the ''Ponte Met\u00e1lica'', textile factories, intellectual centers and Communication vehicles, for example. The period was marked as the belle \u00e9poque of Fortaleza, representing a time of economic consecration that was reflected in areas such as architecture, culture and intellectual production. Between the years 1846 and 1877, the city went through a period of enrichment, economic and infrastructural improvement.<ref>[https://archive.is/20140920011802/http://www.reference.com/browse/fortaleza History of Fortaleza {{en icon}}]</ref>\n\nIn order to discipline the growth of the city, Adolpho Herbster continued the urban planning scheme conceived by Silva Paulet in 1818, characterized by a checkerboard street grid, and, inspired by the reforms carried out in Paris by [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann|Baron Haussman]], designed the topographic plan of the fortress and suburbs in 1875 a definitive landmark of municipal urbanism. In the 1870s and 1880s, the Cear\u00e1 Abolitionist Movement and the republican ideals that culminated in the liberation of the slaves in Cear\u00e1 on March 25, 1884, four years before the [[Golden Law]] came into being and were strengthened. The main event of the abolitionist cause of Cear\u00e1 in the capital was the popular uprising, between January 27 and 31, 1881, led by the Dragon-headed raiders, who ended the slave trade in the capital, fueling the state libertarian impetus and National level. The intellectuals of the literary movement of the Spiritual Bakery, which emerged in 1892, greatly contributed to the diffusion of progressive ideas in Fortaleza.{{cn|date=October 2017}}\n\n[[File:Pra\u00e7a do Ferreira com coreto 1920.PNG|thumb|Ferreira Square in 1920]]\n\n===Republican period===\n\nIn the twentieth century, Fortaleza underwent significant urban changes, with improvements and the rural exodus to the city, with growth mostly towards the end of the decade of 1910, this made the city the seventh most populated city in Brazil.

In this sense, freedom may include freedom from poverty, starvation, treatable disease and oppression as well as freedom from force and coercion, from whomever they may issue.\n\n[[Classical liberalism|Classical liberal]] [[Friedrich Hayek]] criticized this as a misconception of freedom: <blockquote>[T]he use of \"liberty\" to describe the physical \"ability to do what I want\", the power to satisfy our wishes, or the extent of the choice of alternatives open to us [...] has been deliberately fostered as part of the socialist argument[.] [T]he notion of collective power over circumstances has been substituted for that of individual liberty.<ref>Friedrich August von Hayek, \"Freedom and Coercion\" in David Miller (ed), ''Liberty'' (1991) pp. 80, 85\u201386.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Social anarchism|Anarcho-socialists]] see negative and positive liberty as complementary concepts of freedom. Such a view of rights may require utilitarian trade-offs, such as sacrificing the right to the product of one's labor or freedom of association for less racial discrimination or more subsidies for housing. Social anarchists describe the negative liberty-centric view endorsed by [[Right Libertarianism|capitalism]] as \"selfish freedom\".<ref>[http://www.spunk.org/texts/intro/faq/sp001547/secF2.html#secf22 \"Anarchism FAQ\"].</ref>\n\n[[Anarcho-capitalism|Anarcho-capitalists]] see negative rights as a consistent system. [[Ayn Rand]] described it as \"a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man\u2019s freedom of action in a social context\". To such libertarians, positive liberty is contradictory since so-called rights must be traded off against each other, debasing legitimate rights which by definition trump other moral considerations. Any alleged right which calls for an end result (e.g. housing, education, medical services and so on) produced by people is in effect a purported right to enslave others.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nSome notable philosophers, such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], have theorized freedom in terms of our social interdependence with other people.<ref>Alasdair MacIntyre, \"The Virtues of Acknowledged Dependence\", ''Rational Dependent Animals: Why Humans Need the Virtues'' (Open Court, 2001).</ref>\n\nIn his book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', American economist [[Milton Friedman]]<nowiki/>argues that there are two types of freedom, namely political freedom and [[economic freedom]]. Friedman asserted that without economic freedom there cannot be political freedom. This idea was contested by [[Robin Hahnel]] in his article \"Why the Market Subverts Democracy\". Hahnel points out a set of issues with Friedman\u2019s understanding of economic freedom, i.e. that there will in fact be infringements on the freedom of others whenever anyone exercises their own economic freedom and that such infringements can only be avoided if there is a precisely defined property rights system\u2014which Friedman fails to provide or specify directly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hahnel|first=R.|date=2009-03-01|title=Why the Market Subverts Democracy|url=http://abs.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0002764208327672|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en|volume=52|issue=7|pages=1006\u20131022|doi=10.1177/0002764208327672}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Capitalism and Freedom|last=Friedman|first=Milton|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> \n\nAccording to political philosopher [[Nikolas Kompridis]], the pursuit of freedom in the modern era can be broadly divided into two motivating ideals, namely freedom as [[autonomy]] or [[independence]] and freedom as the ability to cooperatively initiate a new beginning.<ref>Nikolas Kompridis, \"The Idea of a New Beginning: A Romantic Source of Normativity and Freedom\" in ''Philosophical Romanticism'' (New York: Routledge, 2007), 32-59.</ref>\n\nPolitical freedom has also been theorized in its opposition to and a condition of power relations, or the power of action upon actions, by [[Michel Foucault]].<ref>Michel Foucault, \"The Subject and Power\" in Paul Rabinow and Nikolas S. Rose, eds., ''The Essential Foucault''.</ref> It has also been closely identified with certain kinds of artistic and cultural practice by [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Jacques Ranci\u00e8re]] and [[Theodor Adorno]].\n\n[[Environmentalist]]s often argue that political freedoms should include some constraint on use of [[ecosystem]]s. They maintain there is no such thing, for instance, as freedom to pollute or freedom to deforest given that such activities create [[negative externalities]], which violates other groups' liberty to not be exposed to pollution. The popularity of [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s, [[golf]] and [[urban sprawl]] has been used as evidence that some ideas of freedom and [[ecological conservation]] can clash.

Politics could only be practiced by those who had freed themselves from the necessities of life so that they could participate in the realm of political affairs. According to Arendt, the concept of freedom became associated with the Christian notion of [[free will|freedom of the will]], or inner freedom, around the 5th century CE and since then freedom as a form of political action has been neglected even though, as she says, freedom is \"the raison d'\u00eatre of politics\".<ref>Hannah Arendt, \"What is Freedom?\", ''Between Past and Future: Eight exercises in political thought'' (New York: Penguin, 1993).</ref>\n\nArendt says that political freedom is historically opposed to [[sovereignty]] or will-power since in ancient Greece and Rome the concept of freedom was inseparable from performance and did not arise as a conflict between the will and the self. Similarly, the idea of freedom as freedom from politics is a notion that developed in modern times. This is opposed to the idea of freedom as the capacity to \"begin anew\", which Arendt sees as a corollary to the innate human condition of natality, or our nature as \"new beginnings and hence beginners\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25458723|title=On revolution|last=Hannah|first=Arendt|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1965|isbn=9780140184211|edition=Reprinted|location=London|pages=211|oclc=25458723}}</ref>\n\nIn Arendt's view, political action is an interruption of automatic process, either natural or historical. The freedom to begin anew is thus an extension of \"the freedom to call something into being which did not exist before, which was not given, not even as an object of cognition or imagination, and which therefore, strictly speaking, could not be known\".<ref>Hannah Arendt, \"What is Freedom?\", p. 151.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Academic freedom]]\n* [[Civil and political rights]]\n* [[Decentralization]]\n* [[Dissident]]\n* [[Economic freedom]]\n* Freedom from [[Unreasonable search and seizure|unreasonable searches and seizures]], which is related to freedom of privacy\n* [[Freedom House]]\n* [[Freedom of assembly]]\n* [[Freedom of association]]\n* [[Freedom of movement]]\n* [[Freedom of religion]]\n* [[Freedom of speech]]\n* [[Freedom of the press]]\n* [[Freedom of thought]]\n* [[Global Social Change Research Project]]\n* [[Libertarianism (disambiguation)]]\n* [[List of indices of freedom]]\n* [[Negative and positive rights]]\n* [[Political prisoner]]\n* [[Right to arms]]\n* [[Scientific freedom]]\n* [[Suffrage]]\n* ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote|Freedom}}\n* Alberto Abadie (October 2004).

The use of ''foo'' in a programming context is generally credited to the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC) of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] from circa 1960.<ref name=\"rfc3092\" /> In the complex model system, there were [[scram]] switches located at numerous places around the room that could be thrown if something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train going full-bore at an obstruction.

Because of this, an entry in the 1959 ''Dictionary of the TMRC Language'' went something like this: \"FOO: The first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase '[[Om mani padme hum|foo mane padme hum]].'

These modes are [[eigenfunction]]s of a linear operator on a function space, a common construction in functional analysis.]]\n\n'''Functional analysis''' is a branch of [[mathematical analysis]], the core of which is formed by the study of [[vector space]]s endowed with some kind of limit-related structure (e.g. [[Inner product space#Definition|inner product]], [[Norm (mathematics)#Definition|norm]], [[Topological space#Definition|topology]], etc.) and the [[linear transformation|linear function]]s defined on these spaces and respecting these structures in a suitable sense. The historical roots of functional analysis lie in the study of [[function space|spaces of functions]] and the formulation of properties of transformations of functions such as the [[Fourier transform]] as transformations defining [[continuous function|continuous]], [[unitary operator|unitary]] etc. operators between function spaces. This point of view turned out to be particularly useful for the study of [[differential equations|differential]] and [[integral equations]].\n\nThe usage of the word ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' as a noun goes back to the [[calculus of variations]], implying a [[Higher-order function|function whose argument is a function]]. The term was first used in [[Jacques Hadamard|Hadamard]]'s 1910 book on that subject. However, the general concept of a functional had previously been introduced in 1887 by the Italian mathematician and physicist [[Vito Volterra]].<ref>[http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/Volterra.pdf ''acsu.buffalo.edu'']</ref><ref>''History of the Mathematical Sciences'' {{ISBN|978-93-86279-16-3}} p. 195</ref> The theory of nonlinear functionals was continued by students of Hadamard, in particular [[Maurice Ren\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chet|Fr\u00e9chet]] and [[Paul L\u00e9vy (mathematician)|L\u00e9vy]]. Hadamard also founded the modern school of linear functional analysis further developed by [[Frigyes Riesz|Riesz]] and the [[Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics|group]] of [[Poland|Polish]] mathematicians around [[Stefan Banach]].\n\nIn modern introductory texts to functional analysis, the subject is seen as the study of vector spaces endowed with a topology, in particular [[Dimension (vector space)|infinite-dimensional spaces]]. In contrast, [[linear algebra]] deals mostly with finite-dimensional spaces, and does not use topology. An important part of functional analysis is the extension of the theory of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]], [[integral|integration]], and [[probability]] to infinite dimensional spaces, also known as '''infinite dimensional analysis'''.\n\n==Normed vector spaces==\nThe basic and historically first class of spaces studied in functional analysis are [[complete space|complete]] [[normed vector space]]s over the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s. Such spaces are called [[Banach space]]s. An important example is a [[Hilbert space]], where the norm arises from an inner product. These spaces are of fundamental importance in many areas, including the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]].\n\nMore generally, functional analysis includes the study of [[Fr\u00e9chet space]]s and other [[topological vector space]]s not endowed with a norm.\n\nAn important object of study in functional analysis are the [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear transformation|linear operators]] defined on Banach and Hilbert spaces. These lead naturally to the definition of [[C*-algebra]]s and other [[operator algebra]]s.\n\n===Hilbert spaces===\n[[Hilbert space]]s can be completely classified: there is a unique Hilbert space [[up to]] [[isomorphism]] for every [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of the [[orthonormal basis]]. Finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are fully understood in [[linear algebra]], and infinite-dimensional [[Separable space|separable]] Hilbert spaces are isomorphic to [[Sequence space#\u2113p spaces|<math>\\ell^{\\,2}(\\aleph_0)\\,</math>]]. Separability being important for applications, functional analysis of Hilbert spaces consequently mostly deals with this space. One of the open problems in functional analysis is to prove that every bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space has a proper [[invariant subspace]]. Many special cases of this [[invariant subspace problem]] have already been proven.\n\n===Banach spaces===\nGeneral [[Banach space]]s are more complicated than Hilbert spaces, and cannot be classified in such a simple manner as those. In particular, many Banach spaces lack a notion analogous to an [[orthonormal basis]].\n\nExamples of Banach spaces are [[Lp space|<math>L^{\\,p}</math>-spaces]] for any real number <math>p\\geq1</math> . Given also a measure <math>\\mu</math> on set <math>X</math>, then <math>L^{\\,p}(X)</math>, sometimes also denoted <math>L^{\\,p}(X,\\mu)</math> or <math>L^{\\,p}(\\mu)</math>, has as its vectors equivalence classes <math>[\\,f\\,]</math> of [[Lebesgue-measurable function|measurable function]]s whose [[absolute value]]'s <math>p</math>-th power has finite integral, that is, functions <math>f\\,</math> for which one has\n:<math>\\int_{X}\\left|f(x)\\right|^p\\,d\\mu(x)<+\\infty</math>.\n\nIf <math>\\mu</math> is the [[counting measure]], then the integral may be replaced by a sum. That is, we require\n:<math>\\sum_{x\\in X}\\left|f(x)\\right|^p<+\\infty</math>.\n\nThen it is not necessary to deal with equivalence classes, and the space is denoted <math>\\ell^{\\ p}(X)</math>, written more simply <math>\\,\\ell^{\\,p\\ }</math> in the case when <math>X</math> is the set of non-negative [[integer]]s.\n\nIn Banach spaces, a large part of the study involves the [[Continuous dual|dual space]]: the space of all [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] linear maps from the space into its underlying field, so-called functionals. A Banach space can be canonically identified with a subspace of its bidual, which is the dual of its dual space. The corresponding map is an [[isometry]] but in general not onto. A general Banach space and its bidual need not even be isometrically isomorphic in any way, contrary to the finite-dimensional situation. This is explained in the dual space article.\n\nAlso, the notion of [[derivative]] can be extended to arbitrary functions between Banach spaces. See, for instance, the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]] article.\n</big>\n\n==Major and foundational results==\n\nImportant results of functional analysis include:\n\n===Uniform boundedness principle===\n{{main|Banach-Steinhaus theorem}}\nThe [[uniform boundedness principle]] or [[Banach\u2013Steinhaus theorem]] is one of the fundamental results in functional analysis. Together with the [[Hahn\u2013Banach theorem]] and the [[open mapping theorem (functional analysis)|open mapping theorem]], it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field. In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of [[continuous linear operator]]s (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a [[Banach space]], pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm.\n\nThe theorem was first published in 1927 by [[Stefan Banach]] and [[Hugo Steinhaus]] but it was also proven independently by [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]].\n\n<blockquote>'''Theorem (Uniform Boundedness Principle).''' Let ''X'' be a [[Banach space]] and ''Y'' be a [[normed vector space]]. Suppose that ''F'' is a collection of continuous linear operators from ''X'' to ''Y''. If for all ''x'' in ''X'' one has\n\n:<math>\\sup\\nolimits_{T \\in F} \\|T(x)\\|_Y  < \\infty, </math>\n\nthen\n\n:<math>\\sup\\nolimits_{T \\in F} \\|T\\|_{B(X,Y)}  < \\infty.</math></blockquote>\n\n===Spectral theorem===\n{{main|Spectral theorem}}\nThere are many theorems known as the [[spectral theorem]], but one in particular has many applications in functional analysis. Let ''A'' be the operator of multiplication by ''t'' on {{nowrap|''L''<sup>2</sup>[0, 1]}}, that is\n\n:<math> [A \\varphi](t) = t \\varphi(t). \\;</math>\n\nTheorem:<ref>{{citation | last = Hall |first = B.C. |title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians | page = 147 |publisher = Springer | year = 2013}}</ref> Let ''A''  be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space ''H''. Then there is a [[measure space]] {{nowrap|(''X'', &Sigma;, &mu;)}} and a real-valued [[ess sup|essentially bounded]] measurable function ''f'' on ''X'' and a unitary operator {{nowrap|''U'':''H'' &rarr; ''L''<sup>2</sup><sub>&mu;</sub>(''X'')}} such that\n\n:<math> U^* T U = A \\;</math>\n\nwhere ''T'' is the [[multiplication operator]]:\n\n:<math> [T \\varphi](x) = f(x) \\varphi(x). \\;</math>\n\nand <math>\\|T\\| = \\|f\\|_\\infty</math>\n\nThis is the beginning of the vast research area of functional analysis called [[operator theory]]; see also the [[spectral measure#Spectral measure|spectral measure]].\n\nThere is also an analogous spectral theorem for bounded [[normal operator]]s on Hilbert spaces. The only difference in the conclusion is that now <math>f</math> may be complex-valued.\n\n===Hahn\u2013Banach theorem===\n{{main|Hahn\u2013Banach theorem}}\nThe [[Hahn\u2013Banach theorem]] is a central tool in functional analysis. It allows the extension of [[Bounded operator|bounded linear functionals]] defined on a subspace of some [[vector space]] to the whole space, and it also shows that there are \"enough\" [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] linear functionals defined on every [[normed vector space]] to make the study of the [[dual space]] \"interesting\".\n\n'''Hahn\u2013Banach theorem:'''<ref name=\"rudin\">{{Cite book | isbn = 978-0-07-054236-5 | title = Functional analysis | last1 = Rudin | first1 = Walter | authorlink1 = Walter Rudin | year = 1991 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math}}</ref> If {{math|''p'' : ''V'' \u2192 '''R'''}} is a [[sublinear function]], and {{math|''\u03c6'' : ''U'' \u2192 '''R'''}} is a [[linear functional]] on a [[linear subspace]] {{math|''U'' \u2286 ''V''}} which is [[dominate (mathematics)|dominated]] by {{mvar|p}} on {{mvar|U}}, i.e.\n\n:<math>\\varphi(x) \\leq p(x)\\qquad\\forall x \\in U</math>\n\nthen there exists a linear extension {{math|''\u03c8'' : ''V'' \u2192 '''R'''}} of {{mvar|\u03c6}} to the whole space {{mvar|V}}, i.e., there exists a linear functional {{mvar|\u03c8}} such that\n\n:<math>\\psi(x)=\\varphi(x)\\qquad\\forall x\\in U,</math>\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\le p(x)\\qquad\\forall x\\in V.</math>\n\n===Open mapping theorem===\n{{main|Open mapping theorem (functional analysis)}}\nThe [[open mapping theorem (functional analysis)|open mapping theorem]], also known as the Banach\u2013Schauder theorem (named after [[Stefan Banach]] and [[Juliusz Schauder]]), is a fundamental result which states that if a [[Bounded linear operator|continuous linear operator]] between [[Banach space]]s is [[surjective]] then it is an [[open map]]. More precisely,:<ref name=rudin/>\n\n: '''Open mapping theorem.''' If ''X'' and ''Y'' are Banach spaces and ''A'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' is a surjective continuous linear operator, then ''A'' is an open map (i.e. if ''U'' is an [[open set]] in ''X'', then ''A''(''U'') is open in ''Y'').\n\nThe proof uses the [[Baire category theorem]], and completeness of both ''X'' and ''Y'' is essential to the theorem. The statement of the theorem is no longer true if either space is just assumed to be a [[normed space]], but is true if ''X'' and ''Y'' are taken to be [[Fr\u00e9chet space]]s.\n\n===Closed graph theorem===\n{{main|Closed graph theorem}}\nThe closed graph theorem states the following:\nIf ''X'' is a [[topological space]] and ''Y'' is a [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]], then the graph of a linear map ''T'' from ''X'' to ''Y'' is closed if and only if ''T'' is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].<ref>{{citation | last = Munkres | first = James | authorlink = James Munkres | title=Topology | edition=2nd | publisher=[[Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-13-181629-2 | pages=163\u2013172}}, p. 171</ref>\n\n===Other topics===\n[[List of functional analysis topics]].\n\n==Foundations of mathematics considerations==\nMost spaces considered in functional analysis have infinite dimension. To show the existence of a [[vector space basis]] for such spaces may require [[Zorn's lemma]]. However, a somewhat different concept, [[Schauder basis]], is usually more relevant in functional analysis. Many very important theorems require the [[Hahn\u2013Banach theorem]], usually proved using [[axiom of choice]], although the strictly weaker [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]] suffices. The [[Baire category theorem]], needed to prove many important theorems, also requires a form of axiom of choice.\n\n==Points of view==\nFunctional analysis in its {{As of|2004|alt=present form}} includes the following tendencies:\n*''Abstract analysis''. An approach to analysis based on [[topological group]]s, [[topological ring]]s, and [[topological vector space]]s.\n*''Geometry of [[Banach space]]s'' contains many topics. One is [[combinatorial]] approach connected with [[Jean Bourgain]]; another is a characterization of Banach spaces in which various forms of the [[law of large numbers]] hold.\n*''[[Noncommutative geometry]]''. Developed by [[Alain Connes]], partly building on earlier notions, such as [[George Mackey]]'s approach to [[ergodic theory]].\n*''Connection with [[quantum mechanics]]''. Either narrowly defined as in [[mathematical physics]], or broadly interpreted by, e.g. [[Israel Gelfand]], to include most types of [[representation theory]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of functional analysis topics]]\n* [[Spectral theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Aliprantis, C.D., Border, K.C.: ''Infinite Dimensional Analysis: A Hitchhiker's Guide'', 3rd ed., Springer 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-540-32696-0}}.

Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"[[Bobby soxer (music)|bobby soxers]]\". He released his debut album, ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', in 1946. Sinatra's professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to [[Las Vegas]], where he became one of its best known [[concert residency|residency]] performers as part of the [[Rat Pack]]. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', with his performance subsequently winning an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' (1955), ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'' (1956), ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' (1958), ''[[Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely]]'' (1958) and ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]'' (1960).\n\nSinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, [[Reprise Records]], and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective ''[[September of My Years]]'' and starred in the [[Emmy]]-winning television special ''[[Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music]]''. After releasing ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'', recorded at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]] in Vegas with frequent collaborator [[Count Basie]] in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with [[Tom Jobim]], the album ''[[Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]]''. It was followed by 1968's ''[[Francis A. & Edward K.]]'' with [[Duke Ellington]]. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later and recorded several albums and resumed performing at [[Caesars Palace]], and reached success in 1980 with \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\". Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998.\n\nSinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', he starred in ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' (1949), ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), and ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in ''[[Tony Rome]]'' (1967). Sinatra would later receive the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]] in 1971. On television, ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (ABC TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' began on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as [[Harry S. Truman]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. In crime, the FBI investigated Sinatra and his alleged relationship with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]].\n\nWhile Sinatra never learned how to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife [[Ava Gardner]]. He later married [[Mia Farrow]] in 1966 and [[Barbara Sinatra|Barbara Marx]] in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1983, was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven [[Grammy Awards]], including the [[Grammy Trustees Award]], [[Grammy Legend Award]] and the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. He was collectively included in [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine's compilation [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|of the twentieth century's 100 most influential people.]] After his death, American music critic [[Robert Christgau]] called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\",<ref name=\"Christgau\" /> and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure. {{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=1}}\n\n== Early life ==\n{{Main|Early life of Frank Sinatra}}\n\n[[File:Hoboken c 1908.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hoboken, New Jersey]], early 20th century]]\nFrancis Albert Sinatra{{efn|On his original birth certificate, Sinatra's name was recorded incorrectly as \"Frank Sinestro\", a clerical error.

His personal favorite was [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=93}} He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a \"certain feeling\" to perform live surrounded by musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=112}} By the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an [[air check]] of some compositions by [[Alec Wilder]] which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions:  \"Air for Oboe\", \"Air for English Horn\", \"Air for Flute\", \"Air for Bassoon\", \"Slow Dance\" and \"Theme and Variations\".{{efn|Mitch Miller played English horn and oboe on the Sinatra-led recordings.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}}}} The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music, were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} At one recording session with arranger [[Claus Ogerman]] and an orchestra, Sinatra heard \"a couple of little strangers\" in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of the words to the Jobim melody \"This Happy Madness\", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on ''[[Sinatra & Company]]'' (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nVoice coach John Quinlan was impressed by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, \"He has far more voice than people think he has.

His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was \"virtually undetectable\", with his diction becoming \"precise\" and articulation \"meticulous\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to \"toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=13}}  Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would \"take a musical phrase and play it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars.\" Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone,{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=95\u201396}} and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=59\u201360}}\n[[File:(Portrait of Frank Sinatra and Axel Stordahl, Liederkrantz Hall, New York, N.Y., ca. 1947) (LOC) (4843758568).jpg|thumb|right|Sinatra with Axel Stordahl at the Liederkrantz Hall in New York, {{circa}} 1947]]\n\nArrangers Nelson Riddle and Anthony Fanzo found Sinatra to be a \"perfectionist who drove himself and everybody around him relentlessly\", and stated that his collaborators approached him with a sense of uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=234}}  Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}} On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=105}}  After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told [[Sammy Cahn]], who wrote songs for ''Anchors Aweigh'', \"if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday\". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by [[Jule Styne]], and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=14\u201316}} Unlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it was a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it was a \"rhythm\" number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|pp=28\u201329}} Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at the end of each number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as \"Isn't that a pretty ballad\" or \"Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song\", delivered with \"childlike delight\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=140}} She states that after each show, Sinatra would be \"in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=142}}\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"His voice is more interesting now: he has separated his voice into different colors, in different registers.

There could be an orchestra of a hundred musicians, and if one played a bum note he'd know exactly who was responsible.\"|source=\u2014Barbara Sinatra on Sinatra's voice and musical understanding.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=240}}}}\nSinatra's split with Gardner in the fall of 1953 had a profound impact on the types of songs he sang and on his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a \"brooding melancholy\", such as \"[[I'm a Fool to Want You]]\", \"[[Don't Worry 'Bout Me]]\", \"[[My One and Only Love]]\" and \"[[There Will Never Be Another You]]\",{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=232}} which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was \"not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt\".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=69}} Author Granata considered Sinatra a \"master of the art of recording\", noting that his work in the studio \"set him apart from other gifted vocalists\". During his career he made over 1000 recordings.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=xiii\u2013xvi}} Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for them by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=36}} During his Columbia years Sinatra used an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as \"the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s\", though when performing on talk shows later he used a bullet-shaped [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone|RCA 77]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=37}} At Capitol he used a [[Neumann U47]], an \"ultra-sensitive\" microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nIn the 1950s, Sinatra's career was facilitated by developments in technology. As disc jockey [[Jonathan Schwartz (radio)|Jonathan Schwartz]] said, \"Never before had there been an opportunity for a popular singer to express emotions at an extended length\". In the words of author John Lahr, \"As many as sixteen songs could be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track in a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme\".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=69\u201370}} Santopietro writes that through the 1950s and well into the 1960s, \"Every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin' affairs.

In life a Sikh is expected to constantly remember death so that he or she may be sufficiently prayerful, detached and righteous to break the cycle of birth and death and return to God.\n\nThe public display of grief by wailing or crying out loud at the funeral (called Antam Sanskar  in the Sikh culture) is discouraged and should be kept to a minimum. Cremation is the preferred method of disposal, although if this is not possible other methods such as burial, or burial at sea, are acceptable. Markers such as gravestones, monuments,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} etc. are discouraged, because the body is considered to be only the shell and the person's soul is their real essence.\n\nOn the day of the cremation, the body is washed and dressed and then taken to the Gurdwara or home where hymns (Shabads) from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, the Sikh Scriptures are recited by the congregation. Kirtan may also be performed by Ragis while the relatives of the deceased recite \"Waheguru\" sitting near the coffin. This service normally takes from 30 to 60 minutes. At the conclusion of the service, an Ardas is said before the coffin is taken to the cremation site.\n\nAt the point of cremation, a few more Shabads may be sung and final speeches are made about the deceased person. The eldest son or a close relative generally lights the fire. This service usually lasts about 30 to 60 minutes.\n\nThe ashes are later collected and disposed of by immersing them in the Punjab (five famous rivers in India).\n\nThe Sidaran Paath\nThe ceremony in which the Sidharan Paath is begun after the cremation ceremony, may be held when convenient, wherever the Guru Granth Sahib is present:\n\nHymns are sung from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji.\nThe first five and final verses of \"Anand Sahib,\" the \"Song of Bliss,\" are recited or sung.\nThe first five verses of Sikhism's morning prayer, \"Japji Sahib,\" are read aloud to begin the Sidharan paath.\nA hukam, or random verse, is read from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji.\nArdas, a prayer, is offered.\nPrashad, a sacred sweet, is distributed.\nLangar, a meal, is served to guests.\nWhile the Sidharan paath is being read, the family may also sing hymns daily. Reading may take as long as needed to complete the paath.\n\nThis ceremony is followed by Sahaj Paath Bhog, Kirtan Sohila, night time prayer is recited 1 week and finally Ardas called the \"Antim Ardas\" (\"Final Prayer\") is offered the last week.\n\n==Western funerals==\n\n===Classical antiquity===\n\n====Ancient Greece====\n[[File:Gela Painter - Black-Figure \"Pinax\" (Plaque) - Walters 48225.jpg|thumb|The lying in state of a body ''(prothesis)'' attended by family members, with the women ritually tearing their hair ([[Attica|Attic]], latter 6th century BC)]]\n\n{{Main article|Ancient Greek funerals and burial}}\nThe Greek word for funeral \u2013 ''k\u0113de\u00eda'' (\u03ba\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1) \u2013 derives from the verb ''k\u0113domai'' (\u03ba\u03ae\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9), that means attend to, take care of someone. Derivative words are also ''k\u0113dem\u00f3n'' (\u03ba\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd, \"guardian\") and ''k\u0113demon\u00eda'' (\u03ba\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, \"guardianship\"). From the Cycladic civilization in 3000BC until the Hypo-Mycenaean era in 1200\u20131100 BC the main practice of burial is interment. The cremation of the dead that appears around the 11th century BC constitutes a new practice of burial and is probably an influence from the East. Until the Christian era, when interment becomes again the only burial practice, both cremation and interment had been practiced depending on the area.<ref>Lemos 2002: Lemos I., The Protogeometric Aegean. The Archaeology of the Late Eleventh and Tenth Centuries BC, Oxford</ref>\n\nThe ancient Greek funeral since the [[Homer]]ic era included the ''pr\u00f3thesis'' (\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), the ''ekphor\u00e1'' (\u1f10\u03ba\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac), the burial and the ''per\u00eddeipnon'' (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd).

Today the body is placed in the casket, that is always open in Greek funerals. This part takes place in the house where the deceased had lived. An important part of the Greek tradition is the ''epicedium'', the mournful songs that are sung by the family of the deceased along with professional mourners (who are extinct in the modern era). The deceased was watched over by his beloved the entire night before the burial, an obligatory ritual in popular thought, which is maintained still.\n\n''Ekphor\u00e1'' is the process of transport of the mortal remains of the deceased from his residence to the church, nowadays, and afterward to the place of burial. The procession in the ancient times, according to the law, should have passed silently through the streets of the city. Usually certain favourite objects of the deceased were placed in the coffin in order to \"go along with him.\" In certain regions, [[Charon's obol|coins to pay Charon]], who ferries the dead to the underworld, are also placed inside the casket. A last kiss is given to the beloved dead by the family before the coffin is closed.\n\n[[File:2011 Enterrement de Jacquotte.jpg|thumb|left|Funeral with [[flowers]] on [[marble]]]]\nThe Roman orator [[Cicero]]{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} describes the habit of planting flowers around the tomb as an effort to guarantee the repose of the deceased and the purification of the ground, a custom that is maintained until today.

Eight days after the burial the relatives and the friends of the deceased assembled at the burial spot, where \"the ninths\" would take place, a custom still kept. In addition to this, in the modern era, memorial services take place 40 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year after the death and from then on every year on the anniversary of the death. The relatives of the deceased, for an unspecified length of time that depends on them, are in mourning, during which women wear black clothes and men a black armband.{{Clarify|date=June 2016|reason=this section is about ancient Greece.

No direct description has been passed down of Roman funeral rites. These rites usually included a public procession to the tomb or pyre where the body was to be cremated. The surviving relations bore masks bearing the images of the family's deceased ancestors. The right to carry the masks in public eventually was restricted to families prominent enough to have held ''curule magistracies''. Mimes, dancers, and musicians hired by the undertakers, and professional female mourners, took part in these processions. Less well-to-do Romans could join benevolent funerary societies (''collegia funeraticia'') that undertook these rites on their behalf.\n\nNine days after the disposal of the body, by burial or cremation, a [[Banquet|feast]] was given (''cena novendialis'') and a libation poured over the grave or the ashes. Since most Romans were cremated, the ashes typically were collected in an urn and placed in a niche in a collective tomb called a ''columbarium'' (literally, \"dovecote\"). During this nine-day period, the house was considered to be tainted, ''funesta'', and was hung with Taxus baccata or Mediterranean Cypress branches to warn passersby. At the end of the period, the house was swept out to symbolically purge it of the taint of death.\n\nSeveral Roman holidays commemorated a family's dead ancestors, including the ''Parentalia'', held February 13 through 21, to honor the family's ancestors; and the [[Lemuralia|Feast of the Lemures]], held on May 9, 11, and 13, in which [[ghost]]s (''larvae'') were feared to be active, and the ''pater familias'' sought to appease them with offerings of beans.\n\nThe Romans prohibited cremation or inhumation within the sacred boundary of the city ''([[pomerium]])'', for both religious and civil reasons, so that the priests might not be contaminated by touching a dead body, and that houses would not be endangered by funeral fires.\n\nRestrictions on the length, ostentation, expense of, and behaviour during funerals and mourning gradually were enacted by a variety of lawmakers. Often the pomp and length of rites could be politically or socially motivated to advertise or aggrandise a particular kin group in Roman society. This was seen as deleterious to society and conditions for grieving were set. For instance, under some laws, women were prohibited from loud wailing or lacerating their faces and limits were introduced for expenditure on tombs and burial clothes.\n\nThe Romans commonly built tombs for themselves during their lifetime. Hence these words frequently occur in ancient inscriptions, V.F. Vivus Facit, V.S.P. Vivus Sibi Posuit. The tombs of the rich usually were constructed of [[marble]], the ground enclosed with walls, and planted around with trees. But common sepulchres usually were built below ground, and called [[hypogea]]. There were niches cut out of the walls, in which the urns were placed; these, from their resemblance to the niche of a pigeon-house, were called [[Columbarium|columbaria]].\n\n===North American funerals===\n[[Image:funeral.name.tribute.arp.jpg|thumb|right|A floral name tribute (spelling out the word \"Mum\") at a funeral in England.]]\nWithin the United States and Canada, in most cultural groups and regions, the funeral rituals can be divided into three parts:\nvisitation, funeral, and the burial service.\n[[File:South Korea funeral motorcade.jpg|thumb|A western-style funeral motorcade for a member of a high-ranking military family in [[South Korea]].]]\n\n====Visitation====<!-- This section is linked from Coffin -->\nAt the ''visitation'' (also called a \"[[Viewing (funeral)|viewing]]\", \"[[Wake (ceremony)|wake]]\" or \"calling hours\"), in Christian or secular Western custom, the body of the deceased person (or decedent) is placed on display in the casket (also called a coffin, however almost all body containers are caskets). The viewing often takes place on one or two evenings before the funeral. In the past, it was common practice to place the casket in the decedent\u2019s home or that of a relative for viewing. This practice continues in many areas of Ireland and Scotland. The body is traditionally dressed in the decedent's best clothes. In recent times there has been more variation in what the decedent is dressed in \u2013 some people choose to be dressed in clothing more reflective of how they dressed in life. The body will often be adorned with common jewelry, such as watches, necklaces, brooches, etc. The jewelry may be taken off and given to the family of the deceased prior to burial or be buried with the deceased. Jewelry has to be removed before cremation in order to prevent damage to the crematory. The body may or may not be embalmed, depending upon such factors as the amount of time since the death has occurred, religious practices, or requirements of the place of burial.\n\nThe most commonly prescribed aspects of this gathering are that the attendees sign a book kept by the deceased's survivors to record who attended. In addition, a family may choose to display photographs taken of the deceased person during his/her life (often, formal portraits with other family members and candid pictures to show \"happy times\"), prized possessions and other items representing his/her hobbies and/or accomplishments. A more recent trend is to create a DVD with pictures and video of the deceased, accompanied by music, and play this DVD continuously during the visitation.\n\nThe viewing is either \"open casket\", in which the embalmed body of the deceased has been clothed and treated with cosmetics for display; or \"closed casket\", in which the coffin is closed. The coffin may be closed if the body was too badly damaged because of an accident or fire or other trauma, deformed from illness, if someone in the group is emotionally unable to cope with viewing the corpse, or if the deceased did not wish to be viewed. In cases such as these, a picture of the deceased, usually a formal photo, is placed atop the casket.\n\n[[File:Tombstone of Yossele the Holy Miser.jpg|thumb|left|The tombstone of [[Yossele the Holy Miser]]. According to [[Jewish bereavement]] tradition, the dozens of stones on his tombstone mark respect for the Holy Miser.]]\nHowever, this step is foreign to Judaism; Jewish funerals are held soon after death (preferably within a day or two, unless more time is needed for relatives to come), and the corpse is never displayed.

In the US in 1927, only 6% of the obituaries included the directive, with only 2.2% of those mentioned [[charitable organization|charitable contributions]] instead.

The viewing may end with a prayer service; in a Roman Catholic funeral, this may include a rosary.\n\nA visitation is often held the evening before the day of the funeral. However, when the deceased person is elderly the visitation may be held immediately preceding the funeral. This allows elderly friends of the deceased a chance to view the body and attend the funeral in one trip, since it may be difficult for them to arrange travel; this step may also be taken if the deceased has few survivors or the survivors want a funeral with only a small number of guests.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n====Funeral====\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\n[[File:Flower-arrangement-funeral-white.jpg|thumb|Traditional flower arrangement for funeral ([[Denmark]])]]\nA memorial service, often called a funeral, is often officiated by clergy from the decedent's, or bereaved's, church or religion. A funeral may take place at either a funeral home, church, or crematorium or cemetery chapel. A funeral is held according to the family's choosing, which may be a few days after the time of death, allowing family members to attend the service. This type of memorial service is most common for Christians, and Roman Catholics call it a mass when Eucharist (communion) is offered, the casket is closed and a priest says prayers and blessings. A Roman Catholic funeral must take place in a parish church (usually that of the deceased, or that of the family grave, or a parish to which the deceased had special links). Sometimes family members or friends of the dead will say something. If the funeral service takes place in the funeral home (mostly it takes place in the funeral home's chapel) it can be directed by a clergy (mostly for Protestant churches and sometimes for Catholic churches) or hosted by a very close family member most common a parent. In some traditions if this service takes place in a funeral home it is the same if it would take place in a church. These services if taking place in a funeral home consists of prayers, blessings and eulogies from the family.\n\nThe ''open-casket service'' (which is common in North America) allows mourners to have a final opportunity to view the deceased and say good-bye. There is an order of precedence when approaching the casket at this stage that usually starts with the immediate family (siblings, parents, spouse, children); followed by other mourners, after which the immediate family may file past again, so they are the last to view their loved one before the coffin is closed. This opportunity can take place immediately before the service begins, or at the very end of the service.<ref>Iserson 1994: 445.</ref> A Roman Catholic funeral must be closed-casket, and relatives are expected to attend the few days before the service. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOpen casket funerals and visitations are very rare in some countries, such as the United Kingdom and most European countries, where it is usual for only close relatives to actually see the deceased person and not uncommon for no one to do so. The funeral service itself is almost invariably closed casket. Funeral homes are generally not used for funeral services, which are almost exclusively held in a church, cemetery, or crematorium chapel.\n\nThe deceased is usually transported from the funeral home to a church in a hearse, a specialized vehicle designed to carry casketed remains. The deceased is often transported in a procession (also called a funeral cort\u00e8ge), with the [[hearse]], funeral service vehicles, and private automobiles traveling in a procession to the church or other location where the services will be held. In a number of jurisdictions, special laws cover funeral processions \u2013 such as requiring most other vehicles to give right-of-way to a funeral procession. Funeral service vehicles may be equipped with light bars and special flashers to increase their visibility on the roads. They may also all have their headlights on, to identify which vehicles are part of the cortege, although the practice also has roots in ancient Roman customs.<ref>Olmert, Michael (1996). ''Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser & Curiouser Adventures in History'', p.34. Simon & Schuster, New York. {{ISBN|0-684-80164-7}}.</ref> After the funeral service, if the deceased is to be buried the funeral procession will proceed to a cemetery if not already there. If the deceased is to be cremated, the funeral procession may then proceed to the crematorium.\n\n[[File:Beethoven Funerals.jpg|thumb|[[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s funeral as depicted by [[Franz Xaver St\u00f6ber]].]]\nReligious funeral services commonly include prayers, readings from a sacred text, hymns (sung either by the attendees or a hired vocalist) and words of comfort by the clergy. Frequently, a relative or close friend will be asked to give a [[eulogy]], which details happy memories and accomplishments rather than criticism. Sometimes the eulogy is delivered by clergy. Church bells may also be tolled both before and after the service.\n\nIn some religious denominations, for example, Roman Catholic, and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], eulogies from loved ones are somewhat discouraged during this service. In such cases, the eulogy is only done by a member of the clergy. This tradition is giving way to eulogies read by family members or friends. In these religions the coffin is traditionally closed at the end of the wake and is not re-opened for the funeral service.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nDuring the funeral and at the burial service, the casket may be covered with a large arrangement of flowers, called a casket spray. If the deceased served in a branch of the armed forces, the casket may be covered with a national flag; however, in the US, nothing should cover the national flag according to Title 4, United States Code, Chapter 1, Paragraph 8i. If the funeral service is held in a church, the casket is normally covered in a white pall, which recalls the white garments of baptism.\n\nFuneral customs vary from country to country. In the United States, any type of noise other than quiet whispering or mourning is considered disrespectful. A traditional fire department funeral consists of two raised aerial ladders.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.funeralwise.com/customs/firefighter/definitions/|title=Firefighter Funeral Terms|work=Funeralwise|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> The firefighter(s) travel under the aerials on their ride, on the fire apparatus, to the cemetery. Once there, the grave service includes the playing of bagpipes. The pipes have come to be a distinguishing feature of a fallen hero's funeral. Also a \"Last Alarm Bell\" is rung. A portable fire department bell is tolled at the conclusion of the ceremony.\n\n====Burial service====\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\n[[File:Millais - Das Tal der Stille.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Everett Millais]] \u2013 The Vale of Rest]]\n\nAt a religious burial service, conducted at the side of the grave, [[tomb]], [[mausoleum]] or cremation, the body of the decedent is buried or cremated at the conclusion.\n\nSometimes, the burial service will immediately follow the funeral, in which case a [[funeral procession]] travels from the site of the memorial service to the burial site. In some other cases, the burial service is the funeral, in which case the procession might travel from the cemetery office to the grave site. Other times, the burial service takes place at a later time, when the final resting place is ready, if the death occurred in the middle of winter.\n\nIf the decedent served in a branch of the Armed forces, [[military rites]] are often accorded at the burial service.\n\nIn many religious traditions, [[pallbearer]]s, usually males who are relatives or friends of the decedent, will carry the casket from the chapel (of a funeral home or church) to the hearse, and from the hearse to the site of the burial service. The pallbearers often sit in a special reserved section during the memorial service.\n\nMost religions expect coffins to be kept closed during the burial ceremony. In Eastern Orthodox funerals, the coffins are reopened just before burial to allow mourners to look at the deceased one last time and give their final farewells. Greek funerals are an exception as the coffin is open during the whole procedure unless the state of the body does not allow it.\n\n[[File:Medieval Royal Funeral007.jpg|thumb|[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] depiction of a royal body being laid in a coffin.]]\nMorticians may ensure that all jewelry, including wristwatch, that were displayed at the wake are in the casket before it is buried or entombed. Custom requires that everything goes into the ground; however this is not true for Jewish services. Jewish tradition stipulates that nothing of value is buried with the deceased.\n\nIn the case of cremation such items are usually removed before the body goes into the furnace. Pacemakers are removed prior to cremation \u2013 if left in they could explode.\n\n===Private services===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nThe family of the deceased may wish to have only a very small, private service, with just the deceased's closest family members and friends attending. This type of ceremony  is not open to the public, but only to those invited.\n\n===Memorial services===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\n[[Image:BrochureMemorialSvcWilliamMcKinleyInsidePagesNashuaNH09191901.jpg|thumb|Order of exercises, local memorial service in Nashua, New Hampshire for U.S. President [[William McKinley]] on September 19, 1901, shortly after his assassination.]]\n\nA memorial service, or a commemoration is one given for the deceased when the body is not present. The service takes place ''after'' cremation or [[burial at sea]], after donation of the body to an academic or research institution, or after the ashes have been scattered. It is also significant when the person is [[Declared death in absentia|missing and presumed dead]], or known to be deceased though the body is not recoverable. These services often take place at a funeral home; however, they can be held in a home, school, workplace, church or other location of some significance. A memorial service may include speeches (eulogies), prayers, poems, or songs to commemorate the deceased. Pictures of the deceased and flowers are usually placed where the coffin would normally be placed.\n\nAfter the sudden deaths of important public officials, public memorial services have been held by communities, including those without any specific connection to the deceased. For examples, community memorial services were held after the [[assassination of James A. Garfield|assassinations of US presidents James A. Garfield]] and [[assassination of William McKinley|William McKinley]].\n\n===European funerals===\n\n====In Wales====\nA good funeral (as they were called) had one draw the curtains for a period of time; at the wake, when new visitors arrived, they would enter from the front door and leave through the back door. The women stayed at home whilst the men attended the funeral, the village priest would then visit the family at their home to talk about the deceased and to console them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/9c24f1e1-d62c-3e28-a1db-7664cad06183|title=A good Welsh funeral|date=28 October 2010|website=BBC Wales}}</ref>\n\nThe first child of [[William Price (physician)|William Price]], a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Neo-Druidism|Neo-Druidic]] priest, died in 1884. Believing that it was wrong to bury a corpse, and thereby pollute the earth, Price decided to cremate his son's body, a practice which had been common in [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] societies. \nThe police arrested him for the illegal disposal of a corpse.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/09/15/1032054710047.html?oneclick=true| title = Druid doc with a bee in his bonnet | accessdate = 2007-02-03 | first = Tim | last = Harris | work = theage.com.au | date = 2002-09-16 | location= Melbourne}}</ref> Price successfully argued in court that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal.

The local priest or minister says prayers and blesses the deceased in their house.  The mourners (saattov\u00e4ki) traditionally bring food to the mourners' house. Nowadays the deceased is put into the coffin in the place where they died. The undertaker will pick up the coffin and place it in the hearse and drive it to the funeral home, while the closest relatives or friends of the deceased will follow the hearse in a funeral procession in their own cars. The coffin will be held at the funeral home until the day of the funeral. The funeral services may be divided into two parts. First is the church service (siunaustilaisuus) in a cemetery chapel or local church, than the burial.\n\n====In Iceland====\n{{further|Icelandic funeral|}}\n\n====In Italy====\nThe majority of Italians are [[Roman Catholic]] and follow [[Catholic funeral]] traditions. Historically,  mourners would walk in a funeral procession to the gravesite; today vehicles are used.\n\n====In Greece====\n{{sectstub|date=January 2018}}\n\n====In Poland====\n{{see also|Catholic funeral|}}\nIn Poland, in urban areas, there are usually two, or just one \u201cstop\u201d. The body, brought by a hearse from the mortuary, may be taken to a church or to a cemetery chapel,Then there is a funeral mass or service at cemetery chapel. Following the mass or Service the casket is carried in procession (usually on foot) on a hearse to the grave. Once at the gravesite, the priest will commence the graveside committal service and the casket is lowered. The mass or service usually takes place at the cemetery.\n\nIn some traditional rural areas, the wake (''czuwanie'') takes place in the house of the deceased or their relatives. The body lies in state for three days in the house.The funeral usually takes place on the third day. Family, neighbors and friends gather and pray during the day and night on those three days and nights. There are usually three stages in the funeral ceremony (''ceremonia pogrzebowa'', ''pogrzeb''): the wake (''czuwanie''), then the body is carried by procession (usually on foot) or people drive in their own cars to the church or cemetery chapel for mass, and another procession by foot to the gravesite.\n\nAfter the funeral, families gather for a post-funeral get-together (''stypa''). It can be at the family home, or at a function hall. In Poland cremation is less popular because the Catholic Church in Poland doesn't allow it. Cremation is popular among non-religious and Protestants in Poland.\n\n====In Russia====\n{{further|Russian traditions and superstitions|}}\n\n====In Scotland====\nAn old funeral rite from the Scottish Highlands involved burying the deceased with a wooden plate resting on his chest. On the plate were placed a small amount of earth and salt, to represent the future of the deceased. The earth hinted that the body would decay and become one with the earth, while the salt represented the soul, which does not decay. This rite was known as \"earth laid upon a corpse\". This practice was also carried out in Ireland, as well as in parts of England, particularly in Leicestershire, although in England the salt was intended to prevent air from distending the corpse.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bmpMAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA262&lpg=PA262 \"Salt\"], IN: ''The Table Book of Daily Recreation and Information; Concerning Remarkable Men, Manners, Times, Seasons, Solemnities, Merry-Makings, Antiquities and Novelties, Forming a Complete History of the Year'', ed.

Most Spaniards are Roman Catholics and follow Catholic funeral traditions. First, family and friends sit with the deceased during the wake until the burial. Wakes are a social event and a time to laugh and honor the dead. Following the wake comes the [[funeral mass]] (Tanatorio) at the church or cemetery chapel. Following the mass is the burial. The coffin is then moved from the church to the local cemetery, often with a procession of locals walking behind the hearse.\n\n==Other types of funerals==\n\n=== Celebration of life ===\nA growing number of families choose to hold a '''life celebration''' or '''celebration of life'''<ref name=bbc1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31940529|title=Happy funerals: A celebration of life? - BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-08}}</ref><ref name=cnbc>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100416919|title=Here's to the Hereafter: Celebrating Life with a Party|last=Lisson|first=Meghan|date=2013-01-29|access-date=2016-07-08}}</ref> event for the deceased in addition to or instead of a traditional funeral.

Traditional jazz funerals begin with a processional led by the funeral director, family, friends, and the brass band, i.e., the \"main line\", who march from the funeral service to the burial site while the band plays slow [[dirge]]s and [[Christian hymn]]s. After the body is buried, or \"cut loose\", the band begins to play up-tempo, joyful jazz numbers, as the main line parades through the streets and crowds of \"[[Second line (parades)|second liners]]\" join in and begin dancing and marching along, transforming the funeral into a [[street festival]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sakakeeny|first1=Matt|title=Jazz Funerals and Second Line Parades|url=http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/jazz-funerals-and-second-line-parades|work=knowlouisiana.org Encyclopedia of Louisiana|editor=David Johnson|publisher=Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=13 May 2017|date=3 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Green===\n\n[[File:Toda green funeral1871.jpg|thumb|Photograph (1871\u20132) of a [[Toda people|Toda]] green funeral.]]\n{{main article|Natural burial}}\n\nThe terms \"green burial\" and \"natural burial\", used interchangeably, apply to ceremonies that aim to return the body with the earth with little to no use of artificial, non-biodegradable materials. As a concept, the idea of uniting an individual with the natural world after he or she dies appears as old as human death itself, being widespread before the rise of the funeral industry. Holding environmentally-friendly ceremonies as a modern concept first attracted widespread attention in the 1990s. In terms of [[North America]], the opening of the first explicitly \"green\" burial cemetery in the U.S. took place in the state of [[South Carolina]].

In these societies, white or off-white robes are traditionally worn to symbolize that someone has died and can be seen worn among relatives of the deceased during a funeral ceremony. In Chinese culture, red is strictly forbidden as it is a traditionally symbolic color of happiness. Exceptions are sometimes made if the deceased has reached an advanced age such as 85, in which case the funeral is considered a celebration, where wearing white with some red is acceptable. Contemporary Western influence however has meant that dark-colored or black attire is now often also acceptable for mourners to wear (particularly for those outside the family). In such cases, mourners wearing dark colors at times may also wear a white or off-white armband or white robe.\n\nContemporary [[South Korea]]n funerals typically mix western culture with traditional Korean culture, largely depending on socio-economic status, region, and religion. In almost all cases, all related males in the family wear woven armbands representing seniority and lineage in relation to the deceased, and must grieve next to the deceased for a period of three days before burying the body. During this period of time, it is customary for the males in the family to personally greet all who come to show respect. While burials have been preferred historically, recent trends show a dramatic increase in cremations due to shortages of proper burial sites and difficulties in maintaining a traditional grave.

The new names are typically chosen by a Buddhist priest, after consulting the family of the deceased. Most Japanese are cremated.\n\nReligious thought among the Japanese people is generally a blend of Shint\u014d and Buddhist beliefs. In modern practice, specific rites concerning an individual's passage through life are generally ascribed to one of these two faiths. Funerals and follow-up memorial services fall under the purview of Buddhist ritual, and 90% Japanese funerals are conducted in a Buddhist manner. Aside from the religious aspect, a Japanese funeral usually includes a wake, the cremation of the deceased, and inclusion within the family grave. Follow-up services are then performed by a Buddhist priest on specific anniversaries after death.\n\nAccording to an estimate in 2005, 99.82% of all deceased Japanese are cremated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srgw.info/CremSoc5/Stats/Interntl/2005/StatsIF.html |title=Cremation Society of G.B. \u2013 International Cremation Statistics 2005 |publisher=Srgw.demon.co.uk |date=2007-02-06 |accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref> In most cases the cremated remains are placed in an [[urn]] and then deposited in a family grave.

These practices have been vastly shaped by the variety of religions and cultures that entered the Philippines throughout its complex [[History of the Philippines|history]].\n\nMost if not all present-day Filipinos, like their ancestors, believe in some form of an [[afterlife]] and give considerable attention to [[veneration of the dead|honouring the dead]].<ref name=MC>[http://musical-chemist.blogspot.com/2009/01/filipinos-and-funeral-traditions.html Filipinos and Funeral Traditions], Organ-ic Chemist, musical-chemist.blogspot.com, January 24, 2009</ref> Except amongst [[Islam in the Philippines|Filipino Muslims]] (who are obliged to bury a corpse less than 24 hours after death), a wake is generally held from three days to a week.<ref name=Sandi>Clark, Sandi.

It is a Korean traditional food and served during funerals.]]\nIn Korea, funerals are typically held for three days and different things are done in each day.\n\nThe first day: on the day a person dies, the body is moved to a funeral hall. They prepare clothes for the body and put them into a chapel of rest. Then food is prepared for the deceased. It is made up of three bowls of rice and three kinds of Korean side dishes. Also, there has to be three coins and three straw shoes. This can be cancelled if the family of the dead person have a particular religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ehaneul.go.kr/contentsS.do?id=M010202003|title=ehanuel|access-date=2017-04-03}}</ref>\n[[File:Soju in korean restaurant.JPG|left|thumb|213x213px|Soju is a Korean vodka and it is served during funerals.]]\nOn the second day the funeral director washes the body and shrouding is done. Then, a family member of the dead person puts uncooked rice in the mouth of the body. This step does not have to be done if the family has a certain religion. After putting the rice in the mouth, the body is moved into a coffin. Family members, including close relatives, of the dead person will wear mourning clothing. Typically, mourning for a woman includes Korean traditional clothes, [[Hanbok]], and mourning for man includes a suit. The color has to be black. The ritual ceremony begins when they are done with changing clothes and preparing foods for the dead person. The ritual ceremony is different depending on their religion. After the ritual ceremony family members will start to greet guests.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Kwang Kyu |last=Lee |year=1984 |title=The Concept of Ancestors and Ancestor Worship in Korea |journal=Nazan University |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=199\u2013214 |issn=0385-2342 |doi=10.2307/1178009|jstor=1178009 }}</ref>\n\nOn the third day, the family decides whether to bury the body in the ground or cremate the body. If they decide to bury the body in the ground, three people from the family sprinkle dirt on the coffin three times. In case of cremation, there are no specific things to be done like ground burial. The only thing needed is a jar to place burned bones in and a place to keep the jar.\n\nOther than these facts, in Korea, people who come to the funeral bring condolence money. Also, a food called [[Yukgaejang]] is served to guests oftentimes with Korean alcohol called [[soju]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seoulsite.com/survival-faq/a-korean-funeral/|title=Seoul Site|website=Seoul Site|access-date=2017-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===In Mongolia===\n\nLike many other cultures, funeral practices in Mongolia are the most important rituals that they follow.

The main one being open-air burial, and the others being cremation and embalming.  There were many factors that went into deciding which funeral practice to do.  These consisted of the family's social standing, the cause of death and the specific location they died at. The main people that were chosen to be embalmed were the people apart of the Lamaistic Church, by choosing this practice, they are usually buried in a sitting position.  This would show that they would always be in the position of prayer.  Also, more important people such as Nobles would be buried with weapons, horses and food in their coffins to help them prepare for the next world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.welcome2mongolia.com/archives/mongolian-practice-of-burial/|title=Mongolian practice of burial|website=www.welcome2mongolia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe coffin is built specifically designed by three to four relatives, mainly men.  In order to determine how big the coffin will be, the builders bring planks to the hut that the dead is located and put together the box and the lid to go with it.  The same people who help put together the coffin also help decorate the funeral. Most of this work is done after the sun goes down.  With very specific instruction, they work on decorations inside the youngest daughters house.  The reason for this is so the deceased is not disturbed at night.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://materialreligions.blogspot.com/2015/04/objects-and-substances-of-funeral.html|title=Objects and Substances of Funeral Mediation in Mongolia: Coffin, Miniature Yurt and Food Offerings|date=2015-04-08|website=Objects and Substances of Funeral Mediation in Mongolia|access-date=2017-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===In Vietnam===\n\nIn Vietnam, [[Buddhism]] is the most commonly practiced religion, however, most burial methods do not coincide with the Buddhist belief of [[cremation]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://vietnamreporter.com.au/burying-the-dead-in-vietnam/|title=Burying the dead in Vietnam {{!}} Vietnam Reporter|website=vietnamreporter.com.au|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe body of the deceased is moved to a loved one\u2019s house and placed in an expensive coffin. The body usually stays there for about three days, allowing time for people to visit and place gifts in the mouth.<ref name=\":1\" /> This stems from the Vietnamese belief that the dead should be surrounded by their family. This belief goes so far as to include superstition as well. If somebody is dying in Vietnamese culture, they are rushed home from the hospital so they can die there, because if they die away from home it is believed to be bad luck to take a corpse home.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://offroadvietnam.com/vietnam-info/customs-and-rites/funerals|title=Funerals.

For the first 49 days after the burying, the family holds a memorial service every 7 days, where the family and friends come back together to celebrate the life of their loved one. After this, they meet again on the 100th day after the death, then 265 days after the death, and finally they meet on the anniversary of the death of their loved one, a whole year later, to continue to continue to celebrate the glorious life of their recently departed.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==African funerals==\n[[File:The corpse is dressed and carried by a blacksmith.

The ceremony depends on the traditions of the ethnicity the deceased belonged to. The funeral may last for as much as a week. Another custom, a kind of memorial, frequently takes place seven years after the person's death. These funerals and especially the memorials may be extremely expensive for the family in question. Cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry, may be offered and then consumed.\n\n[[Ashanti people|The Ashanti]] and [[Akan people|Akan]] ethnic groups in Ghana typically wear red and black during funerals. For special family members, there is typically a funeral celebration with singing and dancing to honor the life of the deceased. Afterwards, the Akan hold a sombre funeral procession and burial with intense displays of sorrow. Other funerals in Ghana are held with the deceased put in elaborate \"fantasy coffins\" colored and shaped after a certain object, such as a fish, crab, boat, and even airplanes.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.a-to-z-of-manners-and-etiquette.com/funeral-and-religious-customs.html |title=Funeral and Religious Customs |publisher=A-to-z-of-manners-and-etiquette.com |date=1936-01-10 |accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref> The [[Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop]] in [[Teshie]], named after Seth Kane Kwei who invented this new style of coffin, has become an international reference for this form of art.\n\nSome diseases, such as [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] can be spread by funerary customs including touching the dead.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1300/the-dead-bodies-of-the-west-african-ebola-epidemic-understanding-the-importance-of-traditional-burial-practices|title=The Dead Bodies of the West African Ebola Epidemic: Understanding the Importance of Traditional Burial Practices|first=Shah, Jamie |last=J|date=22 September 2018|journal=Inquiries Journal|volume=7|issue=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/kissing-the-corpses-in-ebola-country|title=Kissing the Corpses in Ebola Country|date=13 August 2014|website=thedailybeast.com}}</ref> However, safe burials can be achieved by following simple procedures.

The tombs have been constructed to praise the emperors of [[Qing Dynasty]] and their ancestors. In tradition, Chinese have followed the [[Feng Shui]] to build and decorate the interior. All of the tombs are strictly made followed by the Feng Shui theory. Harmony between the architecture and the surrounding topographical structure were seen as an integral part of nature. According to the Feng Shi theory, to build a tomb, there must be a mountain on the northern side and low land on the south. In the west and east, a river must be located.\n\nThe Imperial Tombs of Ming and Qing Dynasties clearly shows the cultural and architectural tradition that has swayed the area for more than 500 years. There is a great harmony between the surrounding nature and the architecture. In Chinese culture, the tombs were considered as a portal between the world of the living and the dead. Chinese believed that the portal would divide the soul into two parts. The half of the soul would go to heaven, and the other half would remain within the physical body.<ref>Johnson, Mark M. \"Imperial Tombs of China.\" Arts and Activities 119.4 (1996): 22. ProQuest.

The mute is depicted in art quite frequently but in literature is probably best known from Dickens's ''[[Oliver Twist]]''. [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]] is working for [[Mr. Sowerberry]] when this conversation takes place: \"There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear... which is very interesting. He would make a delightful mute, my love\". And in ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'', Moult, the undertaker, states, \"This promises to be one of the most impressive funerals,...no limitation of expense...I have orders to put on my whole establishment of mutes, and mutes come very dear, Mr Pecksniff.\" The main purpose of a funeral mute was to stand around at funerals with a sad, pathetic face. A symbolic protector of the deceased, the mute would usually stand near the door of the home or church. In Victorian times, mutes would wear somber clothing including black cloaks, top hats with trailing hatbands, and gloves.<ref name=\"Puckle\">Bertram S. Puckle, ''Funeral Customs: Their Origin and Development'' (London: T. W. Laurie, ltd., 1926) p. 66.</ref>\n\nThe professional mourner, generally a woman, would shriek and wail (often while clawing her face and tearing at her clothing), to encourage others to weep. These people are mentioned{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} in ancient Greek plays, and were commonly employed throughout Europe until the beginning of the nineteenth century. The practice continues in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The 2003 award-winning Philippine comedy ''Crying Ladies'' revolves around the lives of three women who are part-time professional mourners for the Chinese-Filipino community in [[Binondo|Manila's Chinatown]]. According to the film, the Chinese use professional mourners to help expedite the entry of a deceased loved one's soul into heaven by giving the impression that he or she was a good and loving person, well-loved by many.\n\n==State funeral==\n{{main article|State funeral}}\nHigh-ranking national figures such as heads of state, prominent politicians, military figures, national heroes and eminent cultural figures may be offered [[state funeral]]s.\n\n==Final disposition==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}\nSome cultures place the dead in tombs of various sorts, either individually, or in specially designated tracts of land that house tombs. Burial in a [[graveyard]] is one common form of tomb. In some places, burials are impractical because the [[groundwater]] is too high; therefore tombs are placed above ground, as is the case in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], US. Elsewhere, a separate building for a tomb is usually reserved for the socially prominent and wealthy; grand, above-ground tombs are called [[mausoleum]]s. The socially prominent sometimes had the privilege of having their corpses stored in church crypts. In more recent times, however, this has often been forbidden by hygiene laws.\nBurial was not always permanent. In some areas, burial grounds needed to be reused due to limited space. In these areas, once the dead have decomposed to skeletons, the bones are removed; after their removal they can be placed in an [[ossuary]].\n\n===Burial at sea===\n\"[[Burial at sea]]\" in past generations has meant the deliberate disposal of a corpse into the ocean, wrapped and tied with weights to make sure it sinks. It has been a common practice in navies and seafaring nations; in the [[Church of England]], special forms of funeral service were added to the [[Book of Common Prayer]] to cover it. In today's generation, \"burial at sea\" may also refer to the scattering of ashes in the ocean, while \"whole body burial at sea\" refers to the entire uncremated body being placed in the ocean at great depths.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Laws vary by jurisdictions.\n\n[[Science fiction]] writers have frequently extended the concept to a \"[[Space burial|burial in space]]\".\n\n===Cremation===\n{{main article|Cremation}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nCremation is also an old custom; it was the usual mode of disposing of a corpse in [[ancient Rome]] (along with graves covered with heaped mounds, also found in Greece, particularly at the Karameikos graveyard in [[Monastiraki]]). [[Vikings]] were occasionally cremated in their [[longship]]s, and afterwards the location of the site was marked with [[standing stones]].\n\nSince the latter part of the twentieth century, despite the objections of some religious groups, cremation has become increasingly popular. Jewish law (''[[Halakha]]'') forbids cremation, believing that the soul of a cremated person will be unable to find its final repose. The Roman Catholic Church forbade it for many years, but since 1963 the church has allowed it, as long as it is not done to express disbelief in bodily [[resurrection]]. The church specifies that cremated remains are either buried or entombed; they do not allow cremated remains to be scattered or kept at home. Many Catholic cemeteries now have columbarium niches for cremated remains, or specific sections for those remains. Some denominations of [[Protestantism]] allow cremation; the more conservative denominations generally do not. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and Islam also forbid cremation.<ref>[http://www.cremationassociation.org/?page=WhatIsCremation What is Cremation, ''Cremation Association of North America.'']</ref>\n\nAmong Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and some sects of Buddhists such as those found in Japan, cremation is common.\n\n===Feeding to scavenger animals===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\n{{see also|Sky burial}}\nRarer forms of disposal of the dead include exposure to the elements and to scavenger animals. This includes various forms of excarnation, where the corpse is stripped of the flesh, leaving only the bones, which are then either buried or stored elsewhere, in ossuaries or tombs for example. This was done by some groups of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in protohistoric times. Ritual exposure of the dead (without preservation of the bones) is practiced by [[Zoroastrian]]s in [[Mumbai]] and [[Karachi]], where bodies are placed in \"[[Towers of Silence]]\", where [[vulture]]s and other carrion-eating birds dispose of the corpses. In the present-day structures, the bones are collected in a central pit where, assisted by lime, they, too, eventually decompose. Exposure to scavenger birds (with preservation of some, but not all bones) is also practiced by some [[Effects of high altitude on humans|high-altitude]] [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]], where practical considerations such as the lack of firewood and a shallow active layer seem to have led to the practice known as ''jhator'' or \"giving alms to the birds\".\n\n===Mummification===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\n[[File:Takabuti.JPG|thumb|[[Takabuti]], an Egyptian mummy from the 7th century BC]]\nMummification is the drying of bodies to preserve them. The most famous practitioners were [[ancient Egypt]]ians\u2014many nobles and highly ranked bureaucrats had their corpses [[embalm]]ed and stored in luxurious [[sarcophagi]] inside their funeral mausoleums.

[[Patent]]ed by a [[Sweden|Swedish]] company, a promession is also known as an \"ecological funeral\". Its main purpose is to return the body to soil quickly while minimizing pollution and resource consumption. It consists of separating the body from the coffin, freezing it with liquid nitrogen, vibrating it into small particles, freeze drying it, separating any metals, and placing the dry powder remains in a biodegradable casket in top soil.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nyteknik.se/energi/metoderna-som-ersatter-kremering-6404803|title=Metoderna som ers\u00e4tter kremering|website=nyteknik.se}}</ref>\n\n==Self-planned funerals==\n{{Globalize/US|section|date=April 2016}}\nSome people choose to make their funeral arrangements in advance so that at the time of their death, their wishes are known to their family. However, the extent to which decisions regarding the disposition of a decedent's remains (including funeral arrangements) can be controlled by the decedent while still alive vary from one jurisdiction to another. In the United States, there are states which allow one to make these decisions for oneself if desired, for example by appointing an agent to carry out one's wishes; in other states, the law allows the decedent's next-of-kin to make the final decisions about the funeral without taking the wishes of the decedent into account.<ref>[http://www.qeepr.com/blog/who-has-the-right-to-make-decisions-about-your-funeral/ Who Has the Right to Make Decisions About Your Funeral?], www.qeepr.com, February 5, 2014</ref>\n\nThe decedent may, in most U.S. jurisdictions, provide instructions as to the funeral by means of a last will and testament. These instructions can be given some legal effect if bequests are made contingent on the heirs carrying them out, with alternative gifts if they are not followed. This requires the will to become available in time; aspects of the disposition of the remains of US President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] ran contrary to a number of his stated wishes, which were found in a safe that was not opened until after the funeral.\n\n==Organ donation and body donation==\nSome people [[Body donation|donate their bodies]] to a [[medical school]] for use in research or education. Medical students frequently study anatomy from donated cadavers; they are also useful in forensic research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hta.gov.uk/about_hta/faqs/body_donation_faqs.cfm|publisher=UK [[Human Tissue Authority]]|title=Body Donation FAQs}}</ref> Some medical conditions, such as amputations or various surgeries can make the cadaver unsuitable for these purposes; in other cases the bodies of people who had certain medical conditions are useful for research into those conditions. Many medical schools rely on the donation of cadavers for the teaching of anatomy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roach |first=Mary |title=Stiff: The Curious Lives Of Human Cadavers |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0141007458 |id= {{ASIN|0141007451|country=uk}} }}</ref>\n\nIt is also possible to [[Organ donation|donate organs]] and [[Tissue donation|tissue]] after death, for treating the sick, or for research.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:V\u00f6gleins Begr\u00e4bnis.jpg|thumb|The burial of a bird]]\n* [[Dead bell]]\n* [[Funerary art]]\n* [[List of funerals]]\n* [[Wake (ceremony)]]\n* [[Burial]]\n{{-}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Akyel, Dominic.

Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions. Matters such as the [[sex industry]], sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in what came to be known as the [[feminist sex wars]], which pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates.<ref name=Duggan /><ref name=Hansen>{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Karen Tranberg |last2=Philipson |first2=Ilene J. |title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader |year=1990 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-87722-630-7 }}</ref><ref name=Gerhard>{{cite book |author=Gerhard, Jane F. |title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-11204-8}}</ref><ref name=Leidholdt>{{cite book |last1=Leidholdt |first1=Dorchen |authorlink=Dorchen Leidholdt |last2=Raymond |first2=Janice G. |title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-08-037457-4}}</ref><ref name=Vance>{{cite book |author=Vance, Carole S. |title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality |publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=978-0-04-440593-1}}</ref> Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the [[sexual revolution]] from the 1960s and 70s.

Feminists critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality. For the views of feminism on male prostitutes see the article on [[Male_prostitution#Feminist_studies| male prostitution]].\n\nFeminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of [[violence against women]], to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression.<ref name=Duggan>{{cite book |author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. |title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-91036-1 |pages=1\u201314}}</ref><ref name=Hansen/><ref name=Gerhard/><ref name=Leidholdt/><ref name=Vance/> Similarly, feminists' views on prostitution vary, ranging from critical to supportive.<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Neill |first=Maggie |year=2001 |title=Prostitution and Feminism |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=14\u201316}}</ref>\n\n=== Affirming female sexual autonomy ===\nFor feminists, a woman's right to control her own [[Right to sexuality|sexuality]] is a key issue. Feminists such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argue that women have very little control over their own bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement, and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rohana Ariffin|author2=Women's Crisis Centre (Pinang, Malaysia)|title=Shame, secrecy, and silence: study on rape in Penang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HfsDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2011|year=1997|publisher=Women's Crisis Centre|isbn=978-983-99348-0-9}}</ref><ref>Bennett L, Manderson L, Astbury J.

Feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that largely deny women the right to decide how to express their sexuality, because men under patriarchy feel entitled to define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In many{{clarify|date=June 2018}} parts of the world, especially in [[conservative]] and religious cultures, marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Jewkes R, Abrahams N |title= The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview|pmid=12365533|year=2002|volume=55|issue=7|pages=1231\u201344|journal=Social Science & Medicine|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00242-8}}</ref><ref>Sen P.

In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like [[Dale Spender]]'s ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing. \n\nCommensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation.

The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, [[men's studies]], and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.<ref name=Lingard>{{Cite book |last1=Lingard |first1=Bob |last2=Douglas |first2=Peter |title=Men Engaging Feminisms: Pro-Feminism, Backlashes and Schooling |year=1999 |publisher=Open University Press |location=Buckingham, England |isbn=978-0-335-19818-4 |page=192}}</ref><ref name=\"Kimmel-Tide\">{{Cite book |last1=Kimmel |first1=Michael S. |authorlink1=Michael Kimmel |last2=Mosmiller |first2=Thomas E. |title=Against the Tide: Pro-Feminist Men in the United States, 1776\u20131990: A Documentary History |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-8070-6767-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Anti-feminism and criticism of feminism===\n{{Anchor|Critique of Feminism and Anti-feminism|Criticism of feminism and anti-feminism}} <!--Former name-->\n{{main|Antifeminism}}\nAnti-feminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Simpson | first1 = John A. | last2 = Weiner | first2 = Edmund S.C. | author-link1 = John Simpson (lexicographer) | author-link2 = Edmund Weiner | contribution = Anti-feminist | editor-last1 = Simpson | editor-first1 = John A. | editor-last2 = Weiner | editor-first2 = Edmund S.

This landmark legislation was passed at the urging of the aviation industry, whose leaders believed the airplane could not reach its full commercial potential without federal action to improve and maintain safety standards. The Act charged the [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] with fostering air commerce, issuing and enforcing air traffic rules, [[Pilot certification in the United States|licensing pilots]], certifying aircraft, establishing airways, and operating and maintaining aids to air navigation. The newly created Aeronautics Branch, operating under the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] assumed primary responsibility for aviation oversight.\n\nIn fulfilling its civil aviation responsibilities, the Department of Commerce initially concentrated on such functions as safety regulations and the certification of pilots and aircraft. It took over the building and operation of the nation's system of lighted airways, a task initiated by the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office Department]]. The Department of Commerce improved aeronautical radio communications\u2014before the founding of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in 1934, which handles most such matters today\u2014and introduced radio beacons as an effective aid to air navigation.\n\nThe Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934 to reflect its enhanced status within the Department. As commercial flying increased, the Bureau encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing [[air traffic control]] (ATC) along the airways. In 1936, the Bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the ATC system. The pioneer air traffic controllers used maps, blackboards, and mental calculations to ensure the safe separation of aircraft traveling along designated routes between cities.\n\nIn 1938, the [[United States government role in civil aviation|Civil Aeronautics Act]] transferred the federal civil aviation responsibilities from the Commerce Department to a new independent agency, the [[Civil Aeronautics Board|Civil Aeronautics Authority]]. The legislation also expanded the government's role by giving them the authority and the power to regulate airline fares and to determine the routes that air carriers would serve.\n\nPresident [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] split the authority into two agencies in 1940, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB). CAA was responsible for ATC, airman and aircraft certification, safety enforcement, and airway development. CAB was entrusted with safety regulation, accident investigation, and economic regulation of the airlines. The CAA was part of the Department of Commerce. The CAB was an independent federal agency.\n\nOn the eve of America's entry into [[World War II]], CAA began to extend its ATC responsibilities to takeoff and landing operations at airports. This expanded role eventually became permanent after the war. The application of [[radar]] to ATC helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation. In 1946, meanwhile, Congress gave CAA the added task of administering the federal-aid airport program, the first peacetime program of financial assistance aimed exclusively at development of the nation's civil airports.\n\nThe approaching era of [[Jet aircraft|jet]] travel, and a series of midair collisions (most notable was the [[1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision]]), prompted passage of the [[Federal Aviation Act of 1958]]. This legislation gave the CAA's functions to a new independent body, the Federal Aviation Agency. The act transferred air safety regulation from the CAB to the new FAA, and also gave the FAA sole responsibility for a common civil-military system of air navigation and air traffic control. The FAA's first administrator, [[Elwood Richard Quesada|Elwood R. Quesada]], was a former [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] general and adviser to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]].\n\nThe same year witnessed the birth of the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), created in the wake of the Soviets launching of the first artificial satellite and assuming NACA's role of aeronautical research.\n\nIn 1967, a new [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]] (DOT) combined major federal responsibilities for air and surface transport. The Federal Aviation Agency's name changed to the Federal Aviation Administration as it became one of several agencies (e.g., Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, the Coast Guard, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway Commission) within DOT (albeit the largest). The FAA administrator would no longer report directly to the president but would instead report to the Secretary of Transportation. New programs and budget requests would have to be approved by DOT, which would then include these requests in the overall budget and submit it to the president.\n\nAt the same time, a new [[National Transportation Safety Board]] took over the Civil Aeronautics Board's (CAB) role of investigating and determining the causes of transportation accidents and making recommendations to the secretary of transportation. CAB was merged into DOT with its responsibilities limited to the regulation of commercial airline routes and fares.\n\nThe FAA gradually assumed additional functions. The hijacking epidemic of the 1960s had already brought the agency into the field of civil aviation security. In response to the hijackings on September 11, 2001, this responsibility is now primarily taken by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. The FAA became more involved with the environmental aspects of aviation in 1968 when it received the power to set aircraft noise standards. Legislation in 1970 gave the agency management of a new airport aid program and certain added responsibilities for airport safety. During the 1960s and 1970s, the FAA also started to regulate high altitude (over 500 feet) kite and balloon flying.\n[[File:FAA Joint Surveillance Site Canton Michigan.JPG|thumb|200px|right|FAA Joint Surveillance Site radar, [[Canton, Michigan]]]]\nBy the mid-1970s, the agency had achieved a semi-automated air traffic control system using both [[radar]] and computer technology. This system required enhancement to keep pace with air traffic growth, however, especially after the [[Airline Deregulation Act|Airline Deregulation Act of 1978]] phased out the CAB's economic regulation of the airlines. A nationwide strike by the [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)|air traffic controllers union]] in 1981 forced temporary flight restrictions but failed to shut down the airspace system. During the following year, the agency unveiled a new plan for further automating its air traffic control facilities, but progress proved disappointing. In 1994, the FAA shifted to a more step-by-step approach that has provided controllers with advanced equipment.<ref>[http://www.faa.gov/about/history/brief%5Fhistory/ FAA History] from official website.</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Congress authorized the FAA to work with major commercial airports to define [[noise pollution]] [[contour line|contours]] and investigate the feasibility of [[Noise control|noise mitigation]] by residential retrofit programs. Throughout the 1980s, these charters were implemented.\n\nIn the 1990s, satellite technology received increased emphasis in the FAA's development programs as a means to improvements in communications, navigation, and airspace management. In 1995, the agency assumed responsibility for safety oversight of commercial space transportation, a function begun eleven years before by an office within DOT headquarters. The agency was responsible for the decision to ground flights after the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\nIn 2007, two FAA [[whistleblower]]s, inspectors Charalambe \"Bobby\" Boutris and Douglas E. Peters, alleged that Boutris said he attempted to ground Southwest after finding cracks in the [[fuselage]] of an [[aircraft]], but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline.<ref name=\"latimes-faa\">Johanna Neuman, [http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-trw-airlines4apr04,0,4935961.story \"FAA's 'culture of coziness' targeted in airline safety hearing\"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (April 3, 2008).

Among these are demonstrated proficiencies as an aviation mechanic, a flight instructor, a 50-year aviator, or as a safe pilot.

Devices must be held or put in the seat-back pocket during the actual takeoff and landing. Mobile phones must be in airplane mode or with mobile service disabled, with no signal bars displayed, and cannot be used for voice communications due to [[Federal Communications Commission]] regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using mobile phones. If an air carrier provides [[Wi-Fi]] service during flight, passengers may use it. Short-range [[Bluetooth]] accessories, like [[wireless keyboard]]s, can also be used.<ref>{{cite web|title=At last!

Retrieved October 17, 2009</ref>\n\n===Changes to air traffic controller application process===\n\nIn 2014, the FAA modified their approach to air traffic control hiring. They launched more \"off the street bids\", allowing anyone with either a four-year degree or five years of full-time work experience to apply, rather than the closed college program or VRA bids, something that had last been done in 2008. Thousands have been picked up, including veterans, CTI grads, and people who are true \"off the street\" hires.  The move was made to open the job up to more people who might make good controllers but did not go to a college that offered a CTI program.  Before the change, candidates who had completed coursework at participating colleges and universities could be \"fast-tracked\" for consideration. However, the CTI program had no guarantee of a job offer, nor was the goal of the program to teach people to work actual traffic. The goal of the program was to prepare people for the FAA academy in Oklahoma City, OK. Having a CTI certificate allowed a prospective controller to skip the Air Traffic Basics part of the academy, about a 30- to 45-day course, and go right into Initial Qualification Training (IQT). All prospective controllers, CTI or not, have had to pass the FAA Academy in order to be hired as a controller. Failure at the academy means FAA employment is terminated. In January 2015 they launched another pipeline, a \"prior experience\" bid, where anyone with an FAA Control Tower Operator certificate (CTO) and 52 weeks of experience could apply. This was a revolving bid, every month the applicants on this bid were sorted out, and eligible applicants were hired and sent directly to facilities, bypassing the FAA academy entirely.\n\nIn the process of promoting diversity the FAA revised their hiring process.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shapiro|first1=Adam|last2=Browne|first2=Pamela|title=Trouble in the Skies|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2015/05/20/trouble-in-skies/|accessdate=January 3, 2016|publisher=Fox Business|date=May 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Reily|first1=Jason L.|title=Affirmative Action Lands in the Air Traffic Control Tower|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-lands-in-the-air-traffic-control-tower-1433283292|accessdate=January 3, 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=June 2, 2015}}</ref>  The FAA later issued a report that the \"bio-data\" was not a reliable test for future performance. However, the \"Bio-Q\" was not the determinating factor for hiring, it was merely a screening tool to determine who would take a revised Air Traffic Standardized Aptitude Test (ATSAT). Due to cost and time, it was not practical to give all 30,000 some applicants the revised ATSAT, which has since been validated.  There were also charges that the FAA discriminated against qualified candidates and was helping minority candidates \"cheat\" to ensure they passed the test.<ref>{{cite news|title=Unqualified air traffic control candidates cheating to pass FAA exams?|url=http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/4247596762001/unqualified-air-traffic-control-candidates-cheating-to-pass-faa-exams/?intcmp=related#sp=show-clips|accessdate=January 3, 2016|publisher=Fox Business|date=May 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2015, a reverse discrimination lawsuit was filed against the FAA seeking class action status for the thousands of men and women who spent up to $40,000 getting trained under FAA rules before they were abruptly changed.

It was partially carried forward by [[Napoleon]] during the later expansion of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, catalyzed violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon who brought many of its principles to areas he conquered in Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of [[modern history]], triggering the global decline of [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] while replacing them with [[republics]] and [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracies]].<ref>Livesey, James.

It attempted to restore its financial status through unpopular taxation schemes, which were heavily [[regressive tax|regressive]]. Leading up to the Revolution, years of bad harvests worsened by [[deregulation]] of the [[grain]] industry also inflamed popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the aristocracy and the Catholic clergy of the established church. Some historians hold something similar to what Thomas Jefferson proclaimed: that France had \"been awakened by our [American] Revolution.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sister Revolutions|last=Dunn|first=Susan|publisher=Faber and Faber|year=1999|location=New York|pages=9}}</ref> Demands for change were formulated in terms of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals and contributed to the convocation of the [[Estates General of 1789|Estates General]] in May 1789. During the first year of the Revolution, members of the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]] (commoners) took control, the [[Storming of the Bastille|Bastille was attacked]] in July, the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] was passed in August, and a [[The Women's March on Versailles|group of women marched on Versailles]] that forced the royal court back to Paris in October. A central event of the first stage, in August 1789, was the [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolition of feudalism]] and the old rules and privileges left over from the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]''.\n\nThe next few years featured political struggles between various [[Louis XVI and the Legislative Assembly|liberal assemblies]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] supporters of the monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms.  The [[First French Republic|Republic]] was proclaimed in September 1792 after the French [[Battle of Valmy|victory at Valmy]]. In a momentous event that led to international condemnation, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was [[Execution of Louis XVI|executed]] in January 1793.\n\nExternal threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution. The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured [[Military history of France|French victories]] that facilitated the conquest of the [[Italian Peninsula]], the [[Low Countries]] and most territories west of the [[Rhine]] \u2013 achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries. Internally, popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly, culminating in the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]]. The dictatorship imposed by the [[Committee of Public Safety]] during the [[Reign of Terror]], from 1793 until 1794, established [[General maximum|price controls on food]] and other items, abolished slavery in French colonies abroad, de-established the Catholic church ([[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|dechristianised society]]) and created a secular [[French Republican Calendar|Republican calendar]], religious leaders were expelled, and the borders of the new republic were secured from its enemies. Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]], with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000, ranging from aristocrats to \"suspected\" enemies of the revolution.<ref>Matusitz, Jonathan ''Symbolism in Terrorism: Motivation, Communication, and Behavior'', p. 19</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], an executive council known as the [[French Directory|Directory]] assumed control of the French state in 1795. They suspended elections, repudiated debts (creating financial instability in the process), persecuted the Catholic clergy, and made significant military conquests abroad.<ref>Palmer, R.R. & Colton, Joel. ''A History of the Modern World'', pp. 393\u201397</ref> Dogged by charges of corruption, the Directory [[coup of 18 Brumaire|collapsed in a coup]] led by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1799. Napoleon, who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns, established the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and later the First Empire, setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nThe modern era has unfolded in the shadow of the French Revolution. Almost all future revolutionary movements looked back to the Revolution as their predecessor.<ref>Palmer, R.R. & Colton, Joel. ''A History of the Modern World'', p. 361</ref> Its central phrases and cultural symbols, such as ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' and ''[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|Libert\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, ou la mort]]'', became the clarion call for other major upheavals in modern history, including the [[Russian Revolution]] over a century later.<ref>Dmitry Shlapentokh, ''The French Revolution and the Russian Anti-Democratic Tradition'' (Edison, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 1997), pp. 220\u201328</ref>\n\nThe values and institutions of the Revolution dominate French politics to this day. The Revolution resulted in the suppression of the feudal system, emancipation of the individual, a greater division of landed property, abolition of the privileges of noble birth, and nominal establishment of equality among men. The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not only national, for it intended to benefit all humanity.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

It became the focal point for the development of all modern political ideologies, leading to the spread of [[liberalism]], [[Political radicalism|radicalism]], [[nationalism]], and [[secularism]], among many others. The Revolution also witnessed the birth of [[total war]] by organising the resources of France and the lives of its citizens towards the objective of military conquest.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The First Total War: Napoleon's Europe and the Birth of Warfare as We Know It |last=Bell|first=David Avrom |year=2007 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=New York |isbn=0-618-34965-0 |page=51 }}</ref> Some of its central documents, such as the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], continued to inspire movements for [[abolitionism]] and [[universal suffrage]] in the next century.<ref>[[Suzanne Desan]] et al. eds.

''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 p. 26.</ref> Habermas argued that the dominant cultural model in 17th century France was a \"representational\" culture, which was based on a one-sided need to \"represent\" power with one side active and the other passive.<ref name=\"Blanning, T.C.W page 26\"/> A perfect example would be the [[Palace of Versailles]], which was meant to overwhelm the senses of the visitor and convince one of the greatness of the French state and [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].<ref name=\"Blanning, T.C.W page 26\"/> Starting in the early 18th century the \"public sphere\" emerged which was \"critical\" in that both sides were active.<ref>Blanning, T.C.W. ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 pp. 26\u201327.</ref> Examples of the public sphere included newspapers, journals, masonic lodges, coffee houses and reading clubs where people either in person or virtually via the printed word debated and discussed issues.<ref name=\"Blanning, T.C.W page 27\">Blanning, T.C.W. ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 p. 27.</ref> In France, the emergence of the public sphere outside of the control of the state led to the shift from Versailles to Paris as the cultural capital of France.<ref name=\"Blanning, T.C.W page 27\"/> Likewise, while in the 17th century the court had decided what was culturally good and what was not, in the 18th century the opinion of the court mattered less and consumers became the arbiters of cultural taste.<ref>Blanning, T.C.W. ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 p. 28.</ref> In the 1750s, during the ''\"[[Querelle des Bouffons]]\"'' over the question of the quality of Italian vs. French music, the partisans of both sides appealed to the French public \"because it alone has the right to decide whether a work will be preserved for posterity or will be used by grocers as wrapping-paper\".<ref>Blanning, T.C.W. ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 p. 29.</ref> In 1782, Louis-S\u00e9bastien Mercier wrote: \"The word court no longer inspires awe amongst us as in the time of Louis XIV. Reigning opinions are no longer received from the court; it no longer decides on reputations of any sort ... The court's judgments are countermanded; one says openly that it understands nothing; it has no ideas on the subject and could have none.\"<ref>Blanning, T.C.W. ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 pp. 26\u201327</ref> Inevitably, the belief that public opinion had the right to decide cultural questions instead of deferring to the court transformed itself into the demand that the public also have a say on political questions as well.<ref>Blanning, T.C.W. ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 pp. 29\u201330.</ref>\n\nThe economy in the Ancien R\u00e9gime during the years preceding the Revolution suffered from instability. The sequence of events leading to the Revolution included the national government's fiscal troubles caused by an unjust, inefficient and deeply hated tax system - the [[Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale|''ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale'']] - and by expenditure on numerous large wars.<ref name=\"macroeconomics\" /> The attempt to challenge British naval and commercial power in the [[Seven Years' War]] was a costly disaster, with the loss of [[New France|France's colonial possessions in continental North America]] and the destruction of the French Navy.<ref>Cormack, William S.

Cambridge University Press, 2002.</ref> French forces were rebuilt, and feeling bitter about having lost many of France's overseas colonies to the British Empire during the Seven Years' War, Louis XVI was eager to give the American rebels financial and military support. After the British surrender at the [[Battle of Saratoga]], the French sent 10,000 troops and millions of dollars to the rebels. Despite succeeding in gaining independence for the Thirteen Colonies, France was severely indebted by the [[American Revolutionary War]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} France's inefficient and antiquated financial system could not finance this debt.<ref name=\"Doyle\" /> Faced with a financial crisis, the king called an Estates General, recommended by the [[Assembly of Notables]] in 1787 for the first time in over a century.<ref>De Tocqueville, Alexis, Fran\u00e7ois Furet, and Fran\u00e7oise M\u00e9lonio.

Poor harvests lasting several years and an inadequate transportation system both contributed to making food more expensive.<ref>Tilly, Louise A. \"Food entitlement, famine, and conflict\".

Many were so destitute that they couldn't even feed their families and resorted to theft or prostitution to stay alive. Meanwhile, the royal court at Versailles was isolated from and indifferent to the escalating crisis. While in theory King Louis XVI was an absolute monarch, in practice he was often indecisive and known to back down when faced with strong opposition. While he did reduce government expenditures, opponents in the ''[[parlement]]s'' successfully thwarted his attempts at enacting much needed reforms. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had produced many writers, pamphleteers and publishers who could inform or inflame public opinion. The opposition used this resource to mobilise public opinion against the monarchy, which in turn tried to repress the underground literature.<ref name=\"Doyle\">William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (2nd ed. 2003), pp. 45\u201349, 76\u201377</ref>\n\nMany other factors involved resentments and aspirations given focus by the rise of Enlightenment ideals. These included resentment of royal [[political absolutism|absolutism]]; resentment by peasants, labourers and the [[bourgeoisie]] towards the traditional [[manorialism|seigneurial]] privileges possessed by the nobility; resentment of the Catholic Church's influence over public policy and institutions; aspirations for [[freedom of religion]]; resentment of aristocratic bishops by the poorer rural clergy; aspirations for social, political and economic equality, and (especially as the Revolution progressed) [[republicanism]]; hatred of Queen [[Marie-Antoinette]], who was falsely accused of being a spendthrift and an [[Holy Roman Empire|Austrian]] spy; and anger towards the King for dismissing ministers, including finance minister [[Jacques Necker]], who were popularly seen as representatives of the people.<ref>Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (2003), pp. 73\u201374</ref>\n\n[[Freemasonry]] played an important role in the revolution. Originally largely apolitical, Freemasonry was radicalised in the late 18th century through the introduction of higher grades, which emphasised themes of liberty, equality, and fraternity. Virtually every major player in the Revolution was a Freemason and these themes became the widely recognised slogan of the revolution.<ref>Martin, Henri.

The next year, [[Jacques Necker]], a foreigner, was appointed [[Comptroller]]-General of Finance. He could not be made an official minister because he was a Protestant.<ref name=\"Hib35\">Hibbert, pp. 35, 36</ref>\n\nNecker realised that the country's extremely [[regressive tax]] system subjected the lower classes to a heavy burden,<ref name=\"Hib35\"/> while numerous exemptions existed for the nobility and clergy.<ref name=\"Frey2\">Frey, p. 2</ref> He argued that the country could not be taxed higher; that tax exemptions for the nobility and clergy must be reduced; and proposed that borrowing more money would solve the country's fiscal shortages. Necker published a report to support this claim that underestimated the deficit by roughly 36&nbsp;million [[French livre|livres]], and proposed restricting the power of the ''[[parlement]]s''.<ref name=\"Hib35\"/>\n\nThis was not received well by the King's ministers, and Necker, hoping to bolster his position, argued to be made a minister. The King refused, Necker was dismissed, and [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]] was appointed to the Comptrollership.<ref name=\"Hib35\"/> Calonne initially spent liberally, but he quickly realised the critical financial situation and proposed a new [[tax code]].<ref name=\"D34\">Doyle, ''The French Revolution: A very short introduction'', p. 34</ref>\n\nThe proposal included a consistent [[Land value tax|land tax]], which would include taxation of the nobility and clergy. Faced with opposition from the parlements, Calonne organised the summoning of the [[Assembly of Notables]]. But the Assembly failed to endorse Calonne's proposals and instead weakened his position through its criticism. In response, the King announced the calling of the [[Estates General of 1789 in France|Estates-General for May 1789]], the first time the body had been summoned since 1614. This was a signal that the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon monarchy]] was in a weakened state and subject to the demands of its people.<ref name=\"D36\">Doyle 2003, p. 93</ref>\n\n===Estates-General of 1789===\n{{Main|Estates General of 1789 in France}}\nThe Estates-General was organised into three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the rest of France. It had last met in 1614. Elections were held in the spring of 1789; suffrage requirements for the Third Estate were for French-born or naturalised males, aged 25 years or more, who resided where the vote was to take place and who paid taxes. Strong turnout produced 1,201 delegates, including 303 clergy, 291 nobles and 610 members of the Third Estate. The First Estate represented 100,000 Catholic clergy; the Church owned about 10% of the land and collected its own taxes (the tithe) on peasants. The lands were controlled by bishops and abbots of monasteries, but two-thirds of the 303 delegates from the First Estate were ordinary parish priests; only 51 were bishops.<ref>William Doyle, '' The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) p. 59</ref> The Second Estate represented the nobility, about 400,000 men and women who owned about 25% of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their peasant tenants. About a third of these deputies were nobles, mostly with minor holdings. The Third Estate representation was doubled to 610 men, representing 95% of the population. Half were well educated lawyers or local officials. Nearly a third were in trades or industry; 51 were wealthy land owners.<ref>Doyle, '' The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp. 99\u2013101</ref><ref>Albert Soboul, ''The French Revolution 1787\u20131799'' (1975) pp. 127\u201329.</ref>\n[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|thumb|right|The meeting of the Estates General on 5 May 1789 at Versailles]]\nTo assist delegates, \"Books of grievances\" (''cahiers de dol\u00e9ances'') were compiled to list problems.<ref name=\"Frey 4\">Frey, pp. 4, 5</ref> The books articulated ideas which would have seemed radical only months before; however, most supported the monarchical system in general.

Something.\"<ref>Furet, p. 45</ref>\n\nThe Estates-General convened in the Grands Salles des Menus-Plaisirs in [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]] on 5 May 1789 and opened with a three-hour speech by Necker. The Third Estate demanded that the credentials of deputies should be verified by all deputies, rather than each estate verifying the credentials of its own members, but negotiations with the other estates failed to achieve this. The commoners appealed to the clergy, who asked for more time. Necker then stated that each estate should verify its own members' credentials and that the king should act as arbitrator.<ref name=\"Hib54\">Hibbert, p. 54</ref>\n\n===National Assembly (1789)===\n{{Main|National Assembly (French Revolution)}}\n[[File:Le Serment du Jeu de paume.jpg|thumb|right|The National Assembly taking the [[Tennis Court Oath]] (sketch by [[Jacques-Louis David]])]]\n\nThe middle class were the ones who fanned the flames of revolution.  They established the National Assembly and tried to pressure the aristocracy to spread their money evenly between the upper, middle and lower classes. On 10 June 1789 Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s moved that the Third Estate, now meeting as the ''Communes'' (English: \"Commons\") proceed with verifying its own powers and invite the other two estates to take part, but not to wait for them. They proceeded to do so two days later, completing the process on 17 June.<ref>John Hall Stewart. ''A Documentary Survey of the French Revolution''. (1951), p. 86.</ref> Then they voted a measure far more radical, declaring themselves the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], an assembly not of the Estates but of \"the People\". They invited the other orders to join them, but made it clear they intended to conduct the nation's affairs with or without them.<ref>Schama 2004, p. 303</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to keep control of the process and prevent the Assembly from convening, Louis XVI ordered the closure of the Salle des \u00c9tats where the Assembly met, making an excuse that the carpenters needed to prepare the hall for a royal speech in two days. Weather did not allow an outdoor meeting, and fearing an attack ordered by Louis XVI, they met in a tennis court just outside Versailles, where they proceeded to swear the [[Tennis Court Oath]] (20 June 1789) under which they agreed not to separate until they had given France a constitution. A majority of the representatives of the clergy soon joined them, as did 47 members of the nobility. By 27 June, the royal party had overtly given in, although the military began to arrive in large numbers around Paris and Versailles. Messages of support for the Assembly poured in from Paris and other French cities.<ref name=\"Schama\">Schama 2004, p.312</ref>\n\n==Constitutional monarchy==\n===National Constituent Assembly (July 1789 \u2013 September 1791)===\n{{Main|National Constituent Assembly (France)}}\n\n====Storming of the Bastille====\n{{Main|Storming of the Bastille}}\nBy this time, Necker had earned the enmity of many members of the French court for his overt manipulation of public opinion. [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marie Antoinette]], the King's younger brother the [[Charles X of France|Comte d'Artois]], and other conservative members of the King's [[privy council]] urged him to dismiss Necker as financial advisor. On 11 July 1789, after Necker published an inaccurate account of the government's debts and made it available to the public, the King fired him, and completely restructured the finance ministry at the same time.<ref>Schama 2004, p.317</ref>\n[[File:Anonymous - Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|The [[Storming of the Bastille]] in July 1789 is widely regarded as the most iconic event of the Revolution.]]\nMany Parisians presumed Louis' actions to be aimed against the Assembly and began open rebellion when they heard the news the next day. They were also afraid that arriving soldiers \u2013 mostly foreign mercenaries \u2013 had been summoned to shut down the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]. The Assembly, meeting at Versailles, went into nonstop session to prevent another eviction from their meeting place. Paris was soon consumed by riots, chaos, and widespread looting. The mobs soon had the support of some of the [[Gardes Fran\u00e7aises|French Guard]], who were armed and trained soldiers.<ref>Schama 2004, p. 331</ref>\n\nOn 14 July, the insurgents set their eyes on the large weapons and ammunition cache inside the [[Bastille]] fortress, which was also perceived to be a symbol of royal power. After several hours of combat, the prison fell that afternoon. Despite ordering a ceasefire, which prevented a mutual massacre, Governor Marquis [[Bernard-Ren\u00e9 de Launay]] was beaten, stabbed and decapitated; his head was placed on a pike and paraded about the city. Although the fortress had held only seven prisoners (four forgers, two noblemen kept for immoral behaviour, and a murder suspect) the Bastille served as a potent symbol of everything hated under the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]''. Returning to the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00f4tel de Ville]] (city hall), the mob accused the ''[[Provost (civil)|pr\u00e9v\u00f4t des marchands]]'' (roughly, mayor) [[Jacques de Flesselles]] of treachery and butchered him.<ref>Schama 2004, p. 344</ref>\n\nThe King, alarmed by the violence, backed down, at least for the time being. The [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] took up command of the National Guard at Paris. [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]], president of the Assembly at the time of the [[Tennis Court Oath]], became the city's mayor under a new governmental structure known as the ''commune''. The King visited Paris, where, on 17 July he accepted a [[Flag of France|tricolore]] [[cockade]], to cries of ''Vive la Nation'' (\"Long live the Nation\") and ''Vive le Roi'' (\"Long live the King\").<ref>Schama 2004, p. 357</ref>\n\nNecker was recalled to power, but his triumph was short-lived. An astute financier but a less astute politician, Necker overplayed his hand by demanding and obtaining a general amnesty, losing much of the people's favour.\n\nAs civil authority rapidly deteriorated, with random acts of violence and theft breaking out across the country, members of the nobility, fearing for their safety, fled to neighbouring countries; many of these ''[[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]s'', as they were called, funded counter-revolutionary causes within France and urged foreign monarchs to offer military support to a [[counter-revolution]].<ref>Georges Lefebvre, ''The French Revolution: From its Origins to 1793'' (1952) pp. 187\u201388.</ref>\n\nBy late July, the spirit of [[popular sovereignty]] had spread throughout France. In rural areas, many commoners began to form militias and arm themselves against a foreign invasion: some attacked the [[ch\u00e2teau]]x of the nobility as part of a general agrarian insurrection known as ''\"la Grande Peur\"'' (\"the [[Great Fear]]\"). In addition, wild rumours and paranoia caused widespread unrest and civil disturbances that contributed to the collapse of law and order.<ref>Hibbert, 93</ref>\n\n====Abolition of feudalism ====\n{{Main|Abolition of feudalism in France}}\n[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 26 August 1789]]\nOn 4 and 11 August 1789 the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolished privileges and feudalism]] (numerous peasant revolts had almost brought feudalism to an end) in the [[August Decrees]], sweeping away [[Serfdom|personal serfdom]],<ref name=\"Bert Bakker 2008. pages 49\">{{nl}} Niek Pas \u2013 ''De geschiedenis van Frankrijk in een notendop (The history of France in a nutshell)''.

The Declaration was directly influenced by [[Thomas Jefferson]] working with General Lafayette, who introduced it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gregory Fremont-Barnes|title=Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_2wkP4j-EsC&pg=PA190|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood |page=190|isbn=9780313049514}}</ref>\n\nThe National Constituent Assembly functioned not only as a legislature, but also as a [[Constituent assembly|body to draft a new constitution]].\n\n====Writing the first constitution====\n{{main|French Constitution of 1791}}\nNecker, Mounier, Lally-Tollendal and others argued unsuccessfully for a senate, with members appointed by the crown on the nomination of the people. The bulk of the nobles argued for an aristocratic [[upper house]] elected by the nobles. The popular party carried the day: France would have a single, unicameral assembly. The King retained only a \"[[suspensive veto]]\"; he could delay the implementation of a law, but not block it absolutely. The Assembly eventually replaced the historic [[Provinces of France|provinces]] with 83 ''d\u00e9partements,'' uniformly administered and roughly equal in area and population.<ref name=\"J.M. Thompson, 1943 pp 90-111\"/>\n\nAmid the Assembly's preoccupation with constitutional affairs, the financial crisis had continued largely unaddressed, and the deficit had only increased. [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Honor\u00e9 Mirabeau]] now led the move to address this matter, and the Assembly gave Necker complete financial dictatorship.\n\n====Women's March on Versailles====\n{{Main|Women's March on Versailles}}\n[[File:Women's March on Versailles01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Engraving of the Women's March on Versailles, 5 October 1789]]\n\nFuelled by rumours of a reception for the King's bodyguards on 1 October 1789, at which the national cockade had been trampled upon, on 5 October 1789, crowds of women began to assemble at Parisian markets. The women first marched to the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00f4tel de Ville]], demanding that city officials address their concerns.<ref>Doyle 1989, p.121</ref> The women were responding to the harsh economic situations they faced, especially bread shortages. They also demanded an end to royal efforts to block the National Assembly, and for the King and his administration to move to Paris as a sign of good faith in addressing the widespread poverty.\n\nGetting unsatisfactory responses from city officials, as many as 7,000 women joined the march to Versailles, bringing with them cannons and a variety of smaller weapons. Twenty thousand National Guardsmen under the command of Lafayette responded to keep order, and members of the mob stormed the palace, killing several guards.<ref>Doyle 1989, p. 122</ref> Lafayette ultimately persuaded the king to accede to the demand of the crowd that the monarchy relocate to Paris.\n\nOn 6 October 1789, the King and the royal family moved from Versailles to Paris under the \"protection\" of the National Guards, thus legitimising the National Assembly.\n\n====Revolution and the Church====\n{{Main|Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution|Civil Constitution of the Clergy}}\n[[File:Decret de l'Assembl\u00e9e National qui supprime les Ordres Religieux et Religieuses.jpg|thumb|In this caricature, monks and nuns enjoy their new freedom after the decree of 16 February 1790.]]\n\nThe Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Roman Catholic Church to the state.<ref>Gemma Betros, \"The French Revolution and the Catholic Church,\" ''History Review'' (2010) Issue 68, pp. 16\u201321.</ref> Under the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', the Church had been the largest single landowner in the country, owning about 10% of the land in the kingdom.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Censer and Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution'' p. 4.</ref> The Church was exempt from paying taxes to the government, while it levied a [[tithe]]\u2014a 10% tax on income, often collected in the form of crops\u2014on the general population, only a fraction of which it then redistributed to the poor.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nResentment towards the Church weakened its power during the opening of the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] in May 1789. The Church composed the [[Estates General (France)|First Estate]] with 130,000 members of the clergy. When the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] was later created in June 1789 by the Third Estate, the clergy voted to join them, which perpetuated the destruction of the Estates General as a governing body.<ref>John McManners, ''The French Revolution and the Church,'' pp. 50, 4.</ref> The National Assembly began to enact social and economic reform. Legislation sanctioned on 4 August 1789 abolished the Church's authority to impose the tithe. In an attempt to address the financial crisis, the Assembly declared, on 2 November 1789, that the property of the Church was \"at the disposal of the nation\".<ref>National Assembly legislation cited in John McManners, The French Revolution and the Church, 27.</ref> They used this property to back a new currency, the [[assignats]]. Thus, the nation had now also taken on the responsibility of the Church, which included paying the clergy and caring for the poor, the sick and the orphaned.<ref>John McManners, ''The French Revolution and the Church,'' p. 27.</ref> In December, the Assembly began to sell the lands to the highest bidder to raise revenue, effectively decreasing the value of the assignats by 25% in two years.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Censer and Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution,'' p. 61.</ref> In autumn 1789, legislation abolished [[monastic vows]] and on 13 February 1790 all religious orders were dissolved.<ref>Emmet Kennedy, ''A Cultural History of the French Revolution,'' p 148.</ref> [[Monk]]s and [[nun]]s were encouraged to return to private life and a small percentage did eventually marry.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Censer and Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution,'' 92.</ref>\n\nThe [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]], passed on 12 July 1790, turned the remaining clergy into employees of the state. This established an election system for parish priests and bishops and set a pay rate for the clergy. Many Catholics objected to the election system because it effectively denied the authority of the Pope in Rome over the French Church. In October a group of 30 [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] wrote a declaration saying they could not accept that law, and this protest fueled also civilian opposition against that law.<ref name=Shus-3/>\nEventually, in November 1790, the National Assembly began to require an oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution from all the members of the clergy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> This led to a schism between those clergy who swore the required oath and accepted the new arrangement and those who remained loyal to the Pope. Priests swearing the oath were indicated as 'constitutional', those not taking the oath as 'non-juring' or '[[Refractory clergy|refractory]]' clergy.<ref name=NoahShus-Ch.3>Noah Shusterman \u2013 ''The French Revolution.

Workers complained it reduced the number of first-day-of-the-week holidays from 52 to 37.<ref>Matthew Shaw, ''Time and the French Revolution: The Republican Calendar, 1789 \u2013 Year XIV'' (2011)</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Reign of Terror]], extreme efforts of de-Christianisation ensued, including the imprisonment and massacre of priests and destruction of churches and religious images throughout France. An effort was made to replace the Catholic Church altogether, with civic festivals replacing religious ones. The establishment of the [[Cult of Reason]] was the final step of radical de-Christianisation. These events led to a widespread disillusionment with the Revolution and to counter-rebellions across France. Locals often resisted de-Christianisation by attacking revolutionary agents and hiding members of the clergy who were being hunted. Eventually, [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Committee of Public Safety]] were forced to denounce the campaign,<ref>Censer and Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution'', pp. 92\u201394.</ref> replacing the Cult of Reason with the [[deist]] but still non-Christian [[Cult of the Supreme Being]]. The [[Concordat of 1801]] between Napoleon and the Church ended the de-Christianisation period and established the rules for a relationship between the Catholic Church and the French State that lasted until it was abrogated by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] via the [[separation of church and state]] on 11 December 1905. The persecution of the Church led to a counter-revolution known as the [[War in the Vendee|Revolt in the Vend\u00e9e]].<ref>Jack R. Censer, \"Historians Revisit the Terror \u2013 Again\". ''Journal of Social History'' 48#2 (2014): 383\u2013403.</ref>\n\nHistorians [[Lynn Hunt]] and Jack Censer argue that some French Protestants, the [[Huguenots]], wanted an anti-Catholic regime, and that Enlightenment thinkers such as [[Voltaire]] helped fuel this resentment.<ref>Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 16.</ref> The Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, for example, had told French citizens that it was \"manifestly contrary to the law of nature... that a handful of people should gorge themselves with superfluities while the hungry multitude goes in want of necessities.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Making of the West|last=Hunt|first=Lynn|last2=Martin|first2=Thomas R.|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2003|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=625|display-authors=1}}</ref> Historian [[John McManners]] writes, \"In eighteenth-century France throne and altar were commonly spoken of as in close alliance; their simultaneous collapse ... would one day provide the final proof of their interdependence.\"<ref>John McManners, ''The French Revolution and the Church'', p. 5.</ref>\n\n====Intrigues and radicalism====\nFactions within the Assembly began to clarify. The aristocrat [[Jacques Antoine Marie de Cazal\u00e8s]] and the [[abb\u00e9]] [[Jean-Sifrein Maury]] led what would become known as the [[right-wing politics|right wing]], the opposition to revolution (this party sat on the right-hand side of the Assembly). The \"Royalist democrats\" or ''monarchiens'', allied with [[Jacques Necker|Necker]], inclined towards organising France along lines similar to the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitution]]al model; they included [[Jean Joseph Mounier]], the [[G\u00e9rard de Lally-Tollendal|Comte de Lally-Tollendal]], the [[Stanislas Marie Adelaide, comte de Clermont-Tonnerre|comte de Clermont-Tonnerre]], and [[Pierre Victor, baron Malouet|Pierre Victor Malouet, comte de Virieu]].\n\nThe \"National Party\", representing the centre or centre-left of the assembly, included [[Honor\u00e9 Mirabeau]], Lafayette, and Bailly; while [[Adrien Duport]], [[Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave|Barnave]] and [[Alexandre Lameth]] represented somewhat more extreme views. Almost alone in his radicalism on the left was the [[Arras, France|Arras]] lawyer [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. Abb\u00e9 [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Siey\u00e8s]] led in proposing legislation in this period and successfully forged consensus for some time between the political centre and the [[left-wing politics|left]]. In Paris, various committees, the mayor, the assembly of representatives, and the individual districts each claimed authority independent of the others. The increasingly middle-class [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] under Lafayette also slowly emerged as a power in its own right, as did other self-generated assemblies.\n[[File:Federation.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration]]'' on 14 July 1790 celebrated the establishment of the constitutional monarchy]]\nThe Assembly abolished the symbolic paraphernalia of the ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'' \u2013 armorial bearings, liveries, etc. \u2013 which further alienated the more conservative nobles, and added to the ranks of the ''[[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]s''. On 14 July 1790, and for several days following, crowds in the [[Champ de Mars]] celebrated the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille with the ''[[F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration]]''; [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]] performed a [[mass (liturgy)|mass]]; participants swore an oath of \"fidelity to the nation, the law, and the king\"; the King and the royal family actively participated.<ref>Schama 2004, pp. 433\u201334</ref>\n\nThe electors had originally chosen the members of the [[French Estates-General|Estates-General]] to serve for a single year. However, by the terms of the [[Tennis Court Oath]], the ''communes'' had bound themselves to meet continuously until France had a constitution. Right-wing elements now argued for a new election, but Mirabeau prevailed, asserting that the status of the assembly had fundamentally changed, and that no new election should take place before completing the constitution.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Library of the World's Best Literature, Ancient and Modern, Volume 17|last=Runkle|first=Lucia Isabella Gilbert|publisher=J.

The military officer corps was largely composed of noblemen, who found it increasingly difficult to maintain order within the ranks. In some cases, soldiers (drawn from the lower classes) had turned against their aristocratic commanders and attacked them. At [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], General [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|Bouill\u00e9]] successfully put down one such rebellion, only to be accused of being anti-revolutionary for doing so. This and other such incidents spurred a mass desertion as more and more officers defected to other countries, leaving a dearth of experienced leadership within the army.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Doyle|title=Aristocracy and its Enemies in the Age of Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=flWyXPMY4tcC&pg=PP334|year=2009|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=334\u201336|isbn=9780191609718}}</ref>\n\nThis period also saw the rise of the political \"clubs\" in French politics. Foremost among these was the [[Jacobin Club]]; 152 members had affiliated with the Jacobins by 10 August 1790. The Jacobin Society began as a broad, general organisation for political debate, but as it grew in members, various factions developed with widely differing views. Several of these factions broke off to form their own clubs, such as the Club of '89.<ref>Schama 2004, p. 449</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Assembly continued to work on developing a constitution. A new judicial organisation made all magistracies temporary and independent of the throne. The legislators abolished hereditary offices, except for the monarchy itself.

His brother, the [[Charles X of France|Comte d'Artois]] and his queen, Marie Antoinette, urged a stronger stance against the revolution and support for the \u00e9migr\u00e9s, while he was resistant to any course that would see him openly side with foreign powers against the Assembly. Eventually, fearing for his own safety and that of his family, he decided to flee Paris to the Austrian border, having been assured of the loyalty of the border garrisons.\n\nLouis cast his lot with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General Bouill\u00e9]], who condemned both the emigration and the Assembly, and promised him refuge and support in his camp at [[Montm\u00e9dy]]. On the night of 20 June 1791 the royal family fled the [[Tuileries Palace]] dressed as servants, while their servants dressed as nobles.\n\nHowever, late the next day, the King was recognised and arrested at [[Varennes]] and returned to Paris. The Assembly provisionally suspended the King. He and Queen [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marie Antoinette]] remained held under guard.<ref name=tackett>Timothy Tackett, ''When the King Took Flight'' (Harvard University Press, 2003)</ref> The King's flight had a profound impact on public opinion, turning popular sentiment further against the clergy and nobility, and built momentum for the institution of a constitutional monarchy.<ref name=tackett />\n\n====Completing the constitution====\n{{Main|French Revolution from the summer of 1790 to the establishment of the Legislative Assembly#The Last Days of the National Constituent Assembly|l1=The Last Days of the National Constituent Assembly}}\nAs most of the Assembly still favoured a [[constitutional monarchy]] rather than a republic, the various groups reached a compromise which left Louis XVI as little more than a figurehead: he was forced to swear an oath to the constitution, and a decree declared that retracting the oath, heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to abdication.\n\nHowever, [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]] drafted a petition, insisting that in the eyes of the nation Louis XVI was deposed since his flight. An immense crowd gathered in the [[Champ de Mars]] to sign the petition. [[Georges Danton]] and [[Camille Desmoulins]] gave fiery speeches. The Assembly called for the municipal authorities to \"preserve public order\". The National Guard under Lafayette's command confronted the crowd. The soldiers responded to a barrage of stones by firing into the crowd, killing between 13 and 50 people.<ref>Schama 2004, p. 481</ref> The incident cost Lafayette and his National Guard much public support.\n\nIn the wake of the massacre the authorities closed many of the patriotic clubs, as well as radical newspapers such as [[Jean-Paul Marat]]'s ''[[L'Ami du Peuple]]''. Danton fled to England; Desmoulins and Marat went into hiding.<ref>Clifford D. Conner, ''Jean-Paul Marat: Tribune of the French Revolution'' (2012) ch 4</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in August 1791, a new threat arose from abroad: the King's brother-in-law [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II]], King [[Frederick William II of Prussia]], and the King's brother [[Charles X of France|Charles-Philippe, comte d'Artois]], issued the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]], declaring their intention to bring the French king in the position \"to consolidate the basis of a monarchical government\" and that they were preparing their own troops for action,<ref name=Shus-4>{{nl}} Noah Shusterman \u2013 ''De Franse Revolutie (The French Revolution).''

They now gathered the various constitutional laws they had passed into a single constitution, and submitted it to the recently restored Louis XVI, who accepted it, writing \"I engage to maintain it at home, to defend it from all attacks from abroad, and to cause its execution by all the means it places at my disposal\". The King addressed the Assembly and received enthusiastic applause from members and spectators. With this capstone, the National Constituent Assembly adjourned in a final session on 30 September 1791.<ref>Lefebvre, p. 212.</ref>\n\n===Legislative Assembly (Oct. 1791 \u2013 Sept. 1792)===\n{{Main|Louis XVI and the Legislative Assembly}}\n\nThe [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] first met on 1 October 1791, elected by those 4 million men \u2013 out of a population of 25 million \u2013 who paid a certain minimum amount of taxes.<ref>(German) [http://www.glasnost.de/hist/fr/franzRev4.html 'Die Franz\u00f6sische Revolution von 1789 bis 1794' (The French Revolution from 1789 until 1794)].

The King had to share power with the elected Legislative Assembly, but he retained his royal veto and the ability to select ministers. Early on, the King vetoed legislation that threatened the ''\u00e9migr\u00e9s'' with death and that decreed that every [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|non-juring clergyman]] must take within eight days the civic oath mandated by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Over the course of a year, such disagreements would lead to a [[constitutional crisis]].\n\nLate in 1791, a group of Assembly members who propagated war against [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was, after some remark of politician [[Maximilien Robespierre]], henceforth indicated as the '[[Girondins]]', although not all of them really came from the southern province of [[Gironde]]. A group around Robespierre \u2013 later indicated as '[[The Mountain|Montagnards]]' or '[[Jacobin]]s' \u2013 pleaded against that war; this opposition between those groups would harden and embitter in the next 1\u00bd years.<ref name=\"Shus-4\"/>\n\nIn response to the threat of war of August 1791 from [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], leaders of the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Assembly]] saw such a war as a means to strengthen support for their revolutionary government, and the French people as well as the Assembly thought that they would win a war against [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. On 20 April 1792, [[French Revolutionary Wars#1791\u201392|France declared war on Austria]].<ref name=Shus-4/><ref>The present-day state of [[Austria]] did not exist as such, its territory was part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] which also comprised the present-day states of [[Hungary]], [[History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1648\u20131867)|Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia#Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131918)|Slovakia]], [[Belgium]], [[Slovenia#The Middle Ages to the early modern period|Slovenia]] and [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]]: that Habsburg Monarchy was usually called 'Austria'.</ref> Late April 1792, France invaded and conquered the [[Austrian Netherlands]] (roughly present-day [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]]).<ref name=Shus-4/>\n\n====Failure of the constitutional monarchy====\n{{See also|Louis XVI and the Legislative Assembly}}\n{{Monarchism}}\n{{Republicanism sidebar}}\n\nThe Legislative Assembly degenerated into chaos before October 1792.

However, it failed to consolidate the gains of the Revolution, which continued with increasing momentum and escalating radicalism until 1794. Lyons identifies six reasons for this escalation. First, the king did not accept the limitations on his powers, and mobilised support from foreign monarchs to reverse it. Second, the effort to overthrow the Roman Catholic Church, sell off its lands, close its monasteries and its charitable operations, and replace it with an unpopular makeshift system caused deep consternation among the pious and the peasants. Third, the economy was badly hurt by the issuance of ever increasing amounts of paper money (''[[assignat]]s''), which caused more and more inflation; the rising prices hurt the urban poor who spent most of their income on food. Fourth, the rural peasants demanded liberation from the heavy system of taxes and dues owed to local landowners. Fifth, the working class of Paris and the other cities\u2014the [[sans-culottes]]\u2014resented the fact that the property owners and professionals had taken all the spoils of the Revolution. Finally, foreign powers threatened to overthrow the Revolution, which responded with extremism and systematic violence in its own defence.<ref>Martyn Lyons, ''France under the Directory'' (1975), p. 5</ref>\n\n====Constitutional crisis====\n{{Main|10 August (French Revolution)|September Massacres|Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy}}\n\nIn the summer of 1792, all of Paris was against the king, and hoped that the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Assembly]] would depose the king, but the Assembly hesitated.<ref name=Shust-5>{{nl}} Noah Shusterman \u2013 ''De Franse Revolutie (The French Revolution).''

The Assembly could offer only feeble resistance. In October, however, there was a counterattack accusing the instigators, especially Marat, of being terrorists. This led to a political contest between the more moderate Girondists and the more radical Montagnards inside the Convention, with rumour used as a weapon by both sides. The Girondists lost ground when they seemed too conciliatory.

The many French successes led to the spread of the French revolutionary ideals into neighbouring countries, and indeed across much of Europe. However, the final defeat of Napoleon in 1814 (and 1815) brought a reaction that reversed some \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the revolutionary achievements in France and Europe. The Bourbons were restored to the throne, with the brother of executed King Louis XVI becoming [[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII]].\n\n[[File:Valmy Battle painting.jpg|thumb|French victory over the Prussians at the [[Battle of Valmy]] on 20 September 1792]]\n\nThe politics of the period inevitably drove France towards war with Austria and its allies. The King, many of the Feuillants, and the Girondins specifically wanted to wage war. The King (and many Feuillants with him) expected war would increase his personal popularity; he also foresaw an opportunity to exploit any defeat: either result would make him stronger. The Girondins wanted to [[export the Revolution]] throughout Europe and, by extension, to defend the Revolution within France. The forces opposing war were much weaker. Barnave and his supporters among the Feuillants feared a war they thought France had little chance to win and which they feared might lead to greater radicalisation of the revolution. On the other end of the political spectrum [[Maximilien Robespierre#Opposition to war with Austria|Robespierre opposed a war on two grounds]], fearing that it would strengthen the monarchy and military at the expense of the revolution, and that it would incur the anger of ordinary people in Austria and elsewhere. The Austrian emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], brother of [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marie Antoinette]], may have wished to avoid war, but he died on 1 March 1792.<ref>Schama 2004, p. 505</ref> France preemptively declared war on Austria (20 April 1792) and [[Prussia]] joined on the Austrian side a few weeks later. The invading Prussian army faced little resistance until it was checked at the [[Battle of Valmy]] (20 September 1792) and forced to withdraw.\n\n[[File:Bataille de Fleurus 1794.JPG|thumb|left|The [[French Revolutionary Army]] defeated the combined armies of Austrians, Dutch and British at Fleurus in June 1794]]\n\nThe new-born Republic followed up on this success with a series of victories in Belgium and the [[Rhineland]] in the fall of 1792. The French armies defeated the Austrians at the [[Battle of Jemappes]] on 6 November, and had soon taken over most of the Austrian Netherlands. This brought them into conflict with Britain and the [[Dutch Republic]], which wished to preserve the independence of the southern Netherlands from France. After the French king's execution in January 1793, these powers, along with Spain and most other European states, joined the war against France. Almost immediately, French forces suffered defeats on many fronts, and were driven out of their newly conquered territories in the spring of 1793. At the same time, the republican regime was forced to deal with rebellions against its authority in much of western and southern France. But the allies failed to take advantage of French disunity, and by the autumn of 1793 the republican regime had defeated most of the internal rebellions and halted the allied advance into France itself.\n\nThis stalemate ended in the summer of 1794 with dramatic French victories. The French defeated the allied army at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]], leading to a full Allied withdrawal from the Austrian Netherlands. They pushed the allies to the east bank of the Rhine, allowing France, by the beginning of 1795, to conquer the Dutch Republic itself. The House of Orange was expelled and replaced by the [[Batavian Republic]], a French satellite state. These victories led to the collapse of the anti-French coalition. Prussia, having effectively abandoned the coalition in the fall of 1794, made peace with revolutionary France at [[Peace of Basel|Basel]] in April 1795, and soon thereafter Spain also made peace with France. Britain and Austria were the only major powers to remain at war with France.\n\n===Colonial uprisings===\n[[File:Fire in Saint-Domingo 1791, German copper engraving.jpg|thumb|Slave revolt in Saint Domingue]]\n\nAlthough the French Revolution had a dramatic impact in numerous areas of Europe, the French colonies felt a particular influence.

An alliance of Jacobin and ''sans-culottes'' elements thus became the effective centre of the new government. Policy became considerably more radical, as [[General maximum|\"The Law of the Maximum\"]] set food prices and led to executions of offenders.<ref>White, E. \"The French Revolution and the Politics of Government Finance, 1770\u20131815.\" ''The Journal of Economic History'' 1995, p. 244</ref>\n\nThe price control policy was coeval with the rise to power of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and the [[Reign of Terror]].

The Committee reacted by sending [[dragoon]]s into the countryside to arrest farmers and seize crops. This temporarily solved the problem in Paris, but the rest of the country suffered.

It was ratified by public referendum, but normal legal processes were suspended before it could take effect.<ref>Schama 2004, p. 637</ref>\n\nOn 13 July, the assassination of [[Jean-Paul Marat]]&nbsp;\u2013 a Jacobin leader and journalist known for his bloodthirsty rhetoric&nbsp;\u2013 by [[Charlotte Corday]], a Girondin, resulted in further increase of Jacobin political influence. [[Georges Danton]], the leader of the [[10 August (French Revolution)|August 1792 uprising]] against the [[Louis XVI of France|king]], undermined by several political reversals, was removed from the Committee and Robespierre, \"the Incorruptible\", became its most influential member as it moved to take radical measures against the Revolution's domestic and foreign enemies.<ref name=\"Schama 2004, p.641\"/>\n\nThe Reign of Terror ultimately weakened the revolutionary government, while temporarily ending internal opposition. The Jacobins expanded the size of the army, and [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]] replaced many aristocratic officers with soldiers who had demonstrated their patriotism, if not their ability. The Republican army repulsed the Austrians, [[Prussia]]ns, British, and Spanish. At the end of 1793, the army began to prevail and revolts were defeated with ease. The [[Vent\u00f4se Decrees]] (February\u2013March 1794) proposed the confiscation of the goods of exiles and opponents of the Revolution, and their redistribution to the needy. However, this policy was never fully implemented.<ref>Schama 2004, p. 689</ref>\n\nThree approaches attempt to explain the [[Reign of Terror]] imposed by the Jacobins in 1793\u201394. The older Marxist interpretation argued the Terror was a necessary response to outside threats (in terms of other countries going to war with France) and internal threats (of traitors inside France threatening to frustrate the Revolution). In this interpretation, as expressed by the Marxist historian [[Albert Soboul]], Robespierre and the sans-culottes were heroes for defending the revolution from its enemies. [[Fran\u00e7ois Furet]] has argued that foreign threats had little to do with the terror.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Furet, \"A Deep-rooted Ideology as Well as Circumstance,\" in ''The French Revolution: Conflicting Interpretations,'' ed. by Frank Kafker et al. (2002). p. 222.</ref> Instead, the extreme violence was an inherent part of the intense ideological commitment of the revolutionaries \u2013 their utopian goals required exterminating opposition. Soboul's Marxist interpretation has been largely abandoned by most historians since the 1990s. Hanson (2009) takes a middle position, recognising the importance of the foreign enemies, and sees the terror as a contingency that was caused by the interaction of a series of complex events and the foreign threat. Hanson says the terror was not inherent in the ideology of the Revolution, but that circumstances made it necessary.<ref>Paul R.

Each year, one-third of the chambers was to be renewed. The executive power was in the hands of the five members ([[French Directory|director]]s) of the Directory with a five-year mandate.<ref name=\"NoahShus-Ch.9\" />\n\nThe early directors did not much understand the nation they were governing; they especially had an innate inability to see [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] as anything else than counter-revolutionary and royalist. Local administrators had a better sense of people's priorities, and one of them wrote to the minister of the interior: \"Give back the crosses, the church bells, the Sundays, and everyone will cry: ''\u2019vive la R\u00e9publique!\u2019''\"<ref name=\"NoahShus-Ch.9\" />\n\nThe Directory denounced the arbitrary executions of the Reign of Terror, but itself engaged in large scale illegal repressions, as well as large-scale massacres of civilians in the Vendee uprising. The economy continued in bad condition, with the poor especially hurt by the high cost of food.\n\nState finances were in total disarray; the government could only cover its expenses through the plunder and the tribute of foreign countries. If peace were made, the armies would return home and the directors would have to face the exasperation of the rank-and-file who had lost their livelihood, as well as the ambition of generals who could, in a moment, brush them aside. [[Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell|Rewbell]] were notoriously corrupt themselves and screened corruption in others.

The parliament consisted of two houses: the ''Conseil des Cinq-Cents'' (Council of the Five Hundred) with 500 representatives, and the ''Conseil des Anciens'' (Council of Elders) with 250 senators. Executive power went to five \"directors,\" named annually by the ''Conseil des Anciens'' from a list submitted by the ''Conseil des Cinq-Cents''. The [[universal suffrage|universal male suffrage]] of 1793 was replaced by limited suffrage based on property.

It conquered Belgium and turned it into a province of France; conquered the Netherlands and made it a puppet state; and conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states. The result was glory for France and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However, the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the inexhaustible British Treasury, formed a [[War of the Second Coalition|Second Coalition]] in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Austria). The allies scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, retaking Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands and ending the flow of payments from the conquered areas to France. The treasury was empty. Despite his publicity claiming many glorious victories, Napoleon's army was trapped in Egypt after the British sank the French fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]].

He consolidated old units and split up Austria's holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleon's [[Cisalpine Republic]] was centred on Milan. Genoa the city became a republic while its hinterland became the [[Ligurian Republic]]. The [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] was formed out of the papal holdings and the pope was sent to France. The [[Neapolitan Republic (1799)|Neapolitan Republic]] was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months before the enemy forces of the Coalition recaptured it. In 1805 Napoleon formed the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], with himself as king and his stepson as viceroy. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the [[Batavian Republic]], and Switzerland into the [[Helvetic Republic]]. All these new countries were satellites of France and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernised, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France.<ref>Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003) pp. 62\u201365, 78\u201379, 88\u201396, 115\u201317, 154\u201359</ref>\n\nMost of the new nations were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814.

Newspapers and pamphlets played a central role in stimulating and defining the Revolution. The meetings of the Estates-General in 1789 created an enormous demand for news, and over 130 newspapers appeared by the end of the year. Among the most significant of these newspapers in 1789 were Marat's ''L'Ami du peuple'' and [[Elys\u00e9e Loustallot|Elys\u00e9e Loustallot's]] ''Revolutions de Paris''. The next decade saw 2,000 newspapers founded, with 500 in Paris alone. Most lasted only a matter of weeks.

In order to effectively illustrate the differences between the new Republic and the old regime, the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbolism. To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instil in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Censer and Hunt, \"How to Read Images\" LEF CD-ROM</ref>\n\n===La Marseillaise===\n{{main|La Marseillaise}}\n[[File:Pils - Rouget de Lisle chantant la Marseillaise.jpg|thumb|Rouget de Lisle, composer of the Marseillaise, sings it for the first time in 1792]]\n{{Listen\n |filename     = La Marseillaise.ogg\n |title        = La Marseillaise\n |description  = The French national anthem ''La Marseillaise''; text in French.}}\n\n\"La Marseillaise\" ({{IPA-fr|la ma\u0281s\u025bj\u025bz}}) became the [[national anthem]] of France.

Women had no political rights in pre-Revolutionary France; they were considered \"passive\" citizens; forced to rely on men to determine what was best for them. That changed dramatically in theory as there seemingly were great advances in feminism.  Feminism emerged in Paris as part of a broad demand for social and political reform. The women demanded equality for women and then moved on to a demand for the end of male domination. Their chief vehicle for agitation were pamphlets and women's clubs; for example, a small group called the Cercle Social (Social Circle) campaigned for women's rights, noting that \"the laws favor men at the expense of women, because everywhere power is in your hands.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The French Revolution and Human Rights|publisher=Bedford|year=1996|editor-last=Hunt|editor-first=Lynn|location=Boston|pages=123}}</ref> However, in October 1793, the country's all-male legislative body voted to ban all women's clubs.

Women forced their way into the political sphere. They swore oaths of loyalty, \"solemn declarations of patriotic allegiance, [and] affirmations of the political responsibilities of citizenship.\" [[Charlotte Corday|De Corday d'Armont]] is a prime example of such a woman; engaged in the revolutionary political faction of the [[Girondins]], she assassinated the [[Jacobins|Jacobin]] leader, [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]]. Throughout the Revolution, other women such as [[Pauline L\u00e9on]] and her [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]] supported the radical Jacobins, staged demonstrations in the National Assembly and participated in the riots, often using armed force.<ref>Dalton \"Madame Roland\" 262</ref>\n\nThe March to Versailles is but one example of feminist militant activism during the French Revolution.

They also demanded vigorous price controls to keep bread \u2013 the major food of the poor people \u2013 from becoming too expensive. After the Convention passage law in September 1793, the Revolutionary Republican Women demanded vigorous enforcement, but were counted by market women, former servants, and religious women who adamantly opposed price controls (which would drive them out of business ) and resented attacks on the aristocracy and on religion. Fist fights broke out in the streets between the two factions of women.\n\nMeanwhile, the men who controlled the Jacobins rejected the Revolutionary Republican Women as dangerous rabble-rousers. At this point the Jacobins controlled the government; they dissolved the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, and decreed that all women's clubs and associations were illegal. They sternly reminded women to stay home and tend to their families by leaving public affairs to the men. Organised women were permanently shut out of the French Revolution after October 30, 1793.<ref>Darline Gay Levy, Harriet Branson Applewhite and Mary Durham Johnson, eds.

Her publications emphasised that women and men are different, but this shouldn't stop them from equality under the law. In her \"Declaration on the Rights of Woman\" she insisted that women deserved rights, especially in areas concerning them directly, such as divorce and recognition of illegitimate children.<ref name=\"De Gouges Writings 564\u2013568\">De Gouges \"Writings\" 564\u201368</ref>\n\n[[Madame Roland]] (a.k.a. Manon or Marie Roland) was another important female activist. Her political focus was not specifically on women or their liberation. She focused on other aspects of the government, but was a feminist by virtue of the fact that she was a woman working to influence the world. Her personal letters to leaders of the Revolution influenced policy; in addition, she often hosted political gatherings of the Brissotins, a political group which allowed women to join. As she was led to the scaffold, Madame Roland shouted \"O liberty! What crimes are committed in thy name!\"<ref>Susan Dalton, \"Gender and the Shifting Ground of Revolutionary Politics: The Case of Madame Roland,\" ''Canadian journal of history'' (2001) 36#2 pp. 262\u201367</ref>\n\nMost of these activists were punished for their actions.

Especially for women living in rural areas of France, the closing of the churches meant a loss of normalcy.<ref name=\"Hufton, Olwen pg. 106-107\">Olwen Hufton, ''Women and the Limits of Citizenship'' (1992) pp. 106\u201307</ref>\n\nWhen these revolutionary changes to the Church were implemented, it sparked a counter-revolutionary movement among women. Although some of these women embraced the political and social amendments of the Revolution, they opposed the dissolution of the Catholic Church and the formation of revolutionary cults like the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]].<ref>Desan p. 452</ref> As Olwen Hufton argues, these women began to see themselves as the \"defenders of faith\".<ref name=\"Hufton, Olwen pg. 303\">Hufton, Olwen. \"In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.\" 1998 p. 303</ref> They took it upon themselves to protect the Church from what they saw as a heretical change to their faith, enforced by revolutionaries.\n\nCounter-revolutionary women resisted what they saw as the intrusion of the state into their lives.<ref name=\"Hufton, Olwen pg. 104\">Hufton, ''Women and the Limits of Citizenship'' (1992) p. 104</ref> Economically, many peasant women refused to sell their goods for [[assignats]] because this form of currency was unstable and was backed by the sale of confiscated Church property. By far the most important issue to counter-revolutionary women was the passage and the enforcement of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] in 1790. In response to this measure, women in many areas began circulating anti-oath pamphlets and refused to attend masses held by priests who had sworn oaths of loyalty to the Republic. These women continued to adhere to traditional practices such as Christian burials and naming their children after saints in spite of revolutionary decrees to the contrary.<ref>Olwen Hufton, \"In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.\" 1998 pp. 303\u201304</ref>\n\n==Economic policies==\n[[File:France-500Livres-1790-uni.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35| Early ''Assignat'' of 29 Sept, 1790: 500 [[French livres|livres]]]]\n[[File:The value of assignats(1789-1796).png|thumb|right|The value of Assignats (1789\u201396)]]\n\nThe French Revolution abolished many of the constraints on the economy that had slowed growth during the ancien regime. It abolished tithes owed to local churches as well as feudal dues owed to local landlords. The result hurt the tenants, who paid both higher rents and higher taxes.<ref>D. M. G. Sutherland, \"Peasants, Lords, and Leviathan: Winners and Losers from the Abolition of French Feudalism, 1780\u20131820,\" ''Journal of Economic History'' (2002) 62#1 pp. 1\u201324 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2697970 in JSTOR]</ref> It nationalised all church lands, as well as lands belonging to royalist enemies who went into exile. It planned to use these seized lands to finance the government by issuing [[assignats]].

The government seized the foundations that had been set up (starting in the 13th century) to provide an annual stream of revenue for hospitals, poor relief, and education. The state sold the lands but typically local authorities did not replace the funding and so most of the nation's charitable and [[History of education in France#Revolution|school systems were massively disrupted.]]<ref name=\"in JSTOR\">R.R.

The government decided not to repudiate the old debts. Instead it issued more and more paper money (called \"assignat\") that supposedly were grounded seized lands.  The result was escalating inflation. The government imposed price controls and persecuted speculators and traders in the black market. People increasingly refused to pay taxes as the annual government deficit increased from 10% of gross national product in 1789 to 64% in 1793. By 1795, after the bad harvest of 1794 and the removal of price controls, inflation had reached a level of 3500%. The assignats were withdrawn in 1796 but the replacements also fuelled inflation.  The inflation was finally ended by Napoleon in 1803 with the franc as the new currency.<ref>Elise S. Brezis and Fran\u00e7ois H.

The kings had so thoroughly centralised the system that most nobles spent their time at Versailles, and thus played only a small direct role in their home districts. Thompson says that the kings had \"ruled by virtue of their personal wealth, their patronage of the nobility, their disposal of ecclesiastical offices, their provincial governors (''intendants'') their control over the judges and magistrates, and their command of the Army.\"<ref>J.M. Thompson, ''Robespierre and the French Revolution'' (1962) p. 22</ref>\n\nAfter the first year of revolution, the power of the king had been stripped away, he was left a mere figurehead, the nobility had lost all their titles and most of their land, the Church lost its monasteries and farmlands, bishops, judges and magistrates were elected by the people, and the army was almost helpless, with military power in the hands of the new revolutionary National Guard. The central elements of 1789 were the slogan \"Liberty, Equality and Fraternity' and \"[[The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]\", which Lefebvre calls \"the incarnation of the Revolution as a whole.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Georges Lefebvre|title=The Coming of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4EYuia7buUC&pg=PA212|origyear=1947|year=2005|publisher=Princeton UP|page=212}}</ref>\n\nThe long-term impact on France was profound, shaping politics, society, religion and ideas, and polarising politics for more than a century. Historian [[Fran\u00e7ois Victor Alphonse Aulard|Fran\u00e7ois Aulard]] writes:\n\n<blockquote>From the social point of view, the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system, in the emancipation of the individual, in greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth, the establishment of equality, the simplification of life.... The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.\"<ref>Aulard in Arthur Tilley, ed. (1922) p. 115</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Religion and charity====\nThe most heated controversy was over the status of the Catholic Church.<ref>Emmet Kennedy, ''A Cultural History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp. 145\u201367</ref> From a dominant position in 1788, it was almost destroyed in less than a decade, its priests and nuns turned out, its leaders dead or in exile, its property controlled by its enemies, and a strong effort underway to remove all influence of Christian religiosity, such as Sundays, holy days, saints, prayers, rituals and ceremonies. The movement to dechristianise France not only failed but aroused a furious reaction among the pious.<ref>Kennedy, ''A Cultural History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp. 338\u201353</ref><ref>Furet, ed., ''A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution,'' pp. 20\u201332</ref> Napoleon's Concordat was a compromise that restored some of the Catholic Church's traditional roles but not its power, its lands or its monasteries. Priests and bishops were given salaries as part of a department of government controlled by Paris, not Rome. Protestants and Jews gained equal rights.<ref>Geoffrey Ellis, 'Religion according to Napoleon', in Nigel Aston, ed., ''Religious change in Europe, 1650\u20131914'' (1997)</ref> Battles over the role of religion in the public sphere, and closely related issues such as church-controlled schools, that were opened by the Revolution have never seen closure. They raged into the 20th century. By the 21st century, angry debates exploded over the presence of any Muslim religious symbols in schools, such as the headscarves for which Muslim girls could be expelled. J. Christopher Soper and Joel S. Fetzer explicitly link the conflict over religious symbols in public to the French Revolution, when the target was Catholic rituals and symbols.<ref>J.

The nuns provided comprehensive care for the sick poor on their patrons' estates, not only acting as nurses, but taking on expanded roles as physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries. During the Revolution, most of the orders of nuns were shut down and there was no organised nursing care to replace them.<ref>Tim McHugh, \"Expanding Women's Rural Medical Work in Early Modern Brittany: The Daughters of the Holy Spirit,\" ''Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences'' (2012) 67#3 pp. 428\u201356.

With the breakup of large estates controlled by the Church and the nobility and worked by hired hands, rural France became more a land of small independent farms. Harvest taxes were ended, such as the tithe and seigneurial dues, much to the relief of the peasants. Primogeniture was ended both for nobles and peasants, thereby weakening the family patriarch.

Napoleon as emperor set up a constitutional system (although he remained in full control), and the restored Bourbons were forced to go along with one. After the abdication of Napoleon III in 1871, the monarchists probably had a voting majority, but they were so factionalised they could not agree on who should be king, and instead the [[French Third Republic]] was launched with a deep commitment to upholding the ideals of the Revolution.<ref>Furet, ed., ''A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution,'' pp. 479\u201393</ref><ref>Robert Tombs, \"Inventing politics: from Bourbon Restoration to republican monarchy,\" in Martin S.

Britain led and funded the series of coalitions that fought France from 1793 to 1815, and then restored the Bourbons.\n\nPhilosophically, there was a significant debate internally, regarding the revolution, including the [[Revolution Controversy]], a \"[[pamphlet war]]\" set off by the publication of [[Richard Price]]'s speech, ''[[A Discourse on the Love of Our Country]]'', supporting the French Revolution (as he had the [[American Revolution]]), and saying that patriotism actually centers around loving the people and principles of a nation, not its ruling class. [[Edmund Burke]] responded with his own pamphlet, [[Reflections on the Revolution in France]], attacking the French Revolution as a threat to the aristocracy of all countries.<ref>Emma Vincent Macleod, ''A War of Ideas: British Attitudes to the War against Revolutionary France, 1792\u20131802'' (1999)</ref><ref>Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: The Struggle, Volume II'' (1970) pp. 459\u2013505</ref> [[William Coxe (MP)|William Coxe]] opposed Price's premise that one's country is principles and people, not the State itself.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=J.

Jahann Voeltz (dis.) Combat dans les rues de Gand, nov\u00e9mbre 1789.JPG|thumb|The [[Brabant Revolution]] broke out in the [[Austrian Netherlands]] in October 1789, inspired by the revolution in neighbouring France, but had collapsed by the end of 1790]]\nThe region of modern-day Belgium was divided between two polities: the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]]. Both territories experienced revolutions in 1789. In the Austrian Netherlands, the [[Brabant Revolution]] succeeded in expelling Austrian forces and established the new [[United States of Belgium|United Belgian States]]. The [[Li\u00e8ge Revolution]] expelled the tyrannical Prince-Bishop and installed [[Republic of Li\u00e8ge|a republic]]. Both failed to attract international support. By December 1790, the Brabant revolution had been crushed and Li\u00e8ge was subdued the following year.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary Wars, the French invaded and occupied the region between 1794 and 1814, a time known as the [[French period]]. The new government enforced new reforms, incorporating the region into France itself. New rulers were sent in by Paris. Belgian men were drafted into the French wars and heavily taxed. Nearly everyone was Catholic, but the Church was repressed. Resistance was strong in every sector, as Belgian nationalism emerged to oppose French rule. The French legal system, however, was adopted, with its equal legal rights, and abolition of class distinctions. Belgium now had a government bureaucracy selected by merit.<ref>{{cite book |first=E.

France promoted commerce and capitalism, paving the way for the ascent of the bourgeoisie and the rapid growth of manufacturing and mining. In economics, therefore, the nobility declined while the middle class Belgian entrepreneurs flourished because of their inclusion in a large market, paving the way for Belgium's leadership role after 1815 in the [[Industrial Revolution]] on the Continent.<ref>Bernard A.

Reform was gradual and the regime itself carried out agrarian reforms that had the effect of weakening absolutism by creating a class of independent peasant freeholders.

In 1793, as war broke out in Europe, the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Republican Party]] led by [[Thomas Jefferson]] favoured France and pointed to the 1778 treaty that was still in effect. [[George Washington]] and his unanimous cabinet, including Jefferson, decided that the treaty did not bind the United States to enter the war. Washington proclaimed neutrality instead.<ref>Susan Dunn, ''Sister Revolutions: French Lightning, American Light'' (2000)</ref> Under President [[John Adams]], a [[Federalist Party|Federalist]], an undeclared naval war took place with France from 1798 until 1799, often called the \"[[Quasi War]]\". Jefferson became president in 1801, but was hostile to Napoleon as a dictator and emperor. However, the two entered negotiations over the [[Louisiana Territory]] and agreed to the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, an acquisition that substantially increased the size of the United States.\n\n==Historiography==\n{{Main|Historiography of the French Revolution}}\n\nThe French Revolution has received enormous amounts of historical attention, both from the general public and from scholars and academics. The views of historians, in particular, have been characterised as falling along ideological lines, with disagreement over the significance and the major developments of the Revolution.<ref>Rude pp. 12\u201314</ref> [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] argued that the Revolution was a manifestation of a more prosperous middle class becoming conscious of its social importance.<ref>Rude, p. 15</ref>\n\nOther thinkers, like the conservative [[Edmund Burke]], maintained that the Revolution was the product of a few conspiratorial individuals who brainwashed the masses into subverting the old order\u2014a claim rooted in the belief that the revolutionaries had no legitimate complaints.<ref>Rude, p. 12</ref> Other historians, influenced by [[Marxism|Marxist]] thinking, have emphasised the importance of the peasants and the urban workers in presenting the Revolution as a gigantic [[class struggle]].<ref>Rude, p. 17</ref> In general, scholarship on the French Revolution initially studied the political ideas and developments of the era, but it has gradually shifted towards [[social history]] that analyses the impact of the Revolution on individual lives.<ref>Rude, pp. 12\u201320</ref>\n\nHistorians until the late 20th century emphasised class conflicts from a largely Marxist perspective as the fundamental driving cause of the Revolution.<ref>Soboul, Albert. ''La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', pp. 45\u201348</ref> The central theme of this argument was that the Revolution emerged from the rising bourgeoisie, with support from the [[sans-culottes]], who fought to destroy the aristocracy.<ref>{{cite book|author=George C. Comninel|title=Rethinking the French Revolution: Marxism and the Revisionist Challenge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9HR3ALvUXoC&pg=PA31|year=1987|publisher=Verso|page=31|isbn=9780860918905}}</ref> However, Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations in the 1990s. By the year 2000 many historians were saying that the field of the French Revolution was in intellectual disarray. The old model or paradigm focusing on class conflict has been discredited, and no new explanatory model had gained widespread support.<ref name=\"Rebecca L.

Spang, Paradigms and Paranoia\" />\n\nHistorians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in history. It marks the end of the [[early modern period]], which started around 1500 and is often seen as marking the \"dawn of the [[modern history|modern era]]\".<ref>Frey, \"Preface\"</ref> Within France itself, the Revolution permanently crippled the power of the aristocracy and drained the wealth of the Church, although the two institutions survived despite the damage they sustained. After the collapse of the [[First French Empire|First Empire]] in 1815, the French public lost the rights and privileges earned since the Revolution, but they remembered the participatory politics that characterised the period, with one historian commenting: \"Thousands of men and even many women gained firsthand experience in the political arena: they talked, read, and listened in new ways; they voted; they joined new organisations; and they marched for their political goals. Revolution became a tradition, and [[republicanism]] an enduring option.\"<ref>Hanson, p. 189</ref>\n\nSome historians argue that the French people underwent a fundamental transformation in self-identity, evidenced by the elimination of privileges and their replacement by [[human rights|rights]] as well as the growing decline in social deference that highlighted the principle of equality throughout the Revolution.<ref>Hanson, p. 191</ref> The Revolution represented the most significant and dramatic challenge to political absolutism up to that point in history and spread democratic ideals throughout Europe and ultimately the world.<ref name=\"RiemerSimon1997\">{{cite book|last1=Riemer|first1=Neal|last2=Simon|first2=Douglas|title=The New World of Politics: An Introduction to Political Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKa3FTpH49oC&pg=PA106|year=1997|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-939693-41-2|page=106}}</ref> Throughout the 19th century, the revolution was heavily analysed by economists and political scientists, who saw the [[Social class|class]] nature of the revolution as a fundamental aspect in understanding human social evolution itself. This, combined with the egalitarian values introduced by the revolution, gave rise to a classless and co-operative model for society called \"[[socialism]]\" which profoundly influenced future revolutions in France and around the world.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* {{Portal-inline|French Revolution}}\n* [[Timeline of the French Revolution]]\n* [[Glossary of the French Revolution]] for definitions of technical terms\n* [[List of people associated with the French Revolution]]\n* [[History of France]]\n* [[Paris in the 18th Century]]\n* [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]]\n\n===Political groups during the French Revolution===\n{{Main|List of political groups in the French Revolution}}\n*[[Jacobin]]s\n*[[Cordeliers]]\n*[[Feuillant (political group)|Feuillant]]s\n*[[Society of the Friends of Truth]]\n*[[The Mountain|Montagnards]]\n*[[Girondin]]s\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution|year=2001|location = Pennsylvania|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|first =Jack|last = Censer|author2=Lynn Hunt}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Cole|first=Alistair|title=French electoral systems and elections since 1789|year=1989|author2=Peter Campbell|publisher=Gower|url=https://books.google.com/id=msOIAAAAMAAJ&q=%22first+bicameral+legislature%22+directory+french}}\n*{{Cite book|title=A History of the Modern World|year=1995|location = New York|publisher=McGraw Hill, Inc.|first =R.R.|last = Palmer|author2=Joel Colton}}\n*{{Cite book|title=The Oxford history of the French Revolution|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|first=William|last=Doyle|year=1990|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-285221-3|url=https://books.google.com/id=N7chHQAACAAJ}}\n*{{Cite book|title=The French Revolution: A very short introduction|year=2001|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|first=William|last=Doyle|isbn=0-19-285396-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B-Zf4topzfQC}}\n*{{Cite book|first=William|last=Doyle|title=The Oxford history of the French Revolution|edition=2nd|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn= 0-19-925298-X|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oMYWKlevAV4C}} [https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoff00doyl_0 online]; [https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoff00doyl 2nd edition online]\n*{{Cite book|title=The French Revolution and the Birth of Modernity|year=1990|location = Los Angeles|publisher=University of California Press|first =Ferenc|last = Feher}}\n*{{Cite book|title=The French Revolution|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-313-32193-0|first=Linda|last=Frey|author2=Marsha Frey|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RFgXl1EG5soC}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Interpreting the French Revolution|year=1981|publisher=Cambridge UP|first=F.|last=Furet}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Revolutionary France, 1770\u20131880|year=1995|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|first=Fran\u00e7ois|last=Furet|isbn=0-631-19808-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EPsEJIdFz3AC}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Hampson|first1=Norman|title=A Social History of the French Revolution|year=1988|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Routledge|isbn= 0-710-06525-6|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Contesting the French Revolution|year=2009|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|first=Paul|last=Hanson|isbn=978-1-4051-6083-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dsCf8Q0xqO4C&pg=PA186#v=onepage&q=legacy%20french%20revolution}}\n*{{Cite book|title=The Days of the French Revolution|year=1980|location=New York|publisher=Quill, William Morrow|first=Christopher|last=Hibbert|isbn=0-688-03704-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yr1z38HCkdAC}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Politics, Culture, and Class in the French Revolution|year=1984|location = Berkeley|publisher=University of California Press|first =Lynn|last = Hunt}}\n*{{Cite book|title=A Cultural History of the French Revolution|year=1989|location = New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press|first =Emmet|last = Kennedy}}\n*{{Cite book|title=The French Revolution: From Its Origins to 1793|year=1971|publisher=Columbia University Press|first=Georges|last=Lefebvre|isbn=0-231-08598-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I2oA5MtB0ZkC}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Lefebvre|first1=Georges|title=The Thermidorians & the Directory|year=1964|publisher=Random House |location=New York|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Lefebvre|first1=Georges|title=The French Revolution: from 1793 to 1799|year=1963|volume= vol.

Fukuyama is known for his book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992), which argued that the worldwide spread of [[liberal democracies]] and free market [[capitalism]] of the West and its lifestyle may signal the end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and become the final form of human government.

Fukuyama predicted the eventual global triumph of political and economic liberalism:\n\n{{quote|What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history as such.... That is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.}}\n\nAuthors like [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] argued in 1990 that the essay gave Fukuyama his [[15 minutes of fame]], which will be followed by a slide into obscurity.<ref>Dahrendorf (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=obx2BX91FQUC&pg=PA37 ''Reflections on the revolution in Europe''] p. 37</ref><ref>[[Luciano Canfora]] [http://temi.repubblica.it/micromega-online/la-grande-illusione-del-capitalismo-eterno/ ''La grande illusione del capitalismo eterno''] preface to Ercolani, Paolo ''La storia infinita.

Postmodern philosophy had, in Fukuyama's opinion, undermined the ideology behind liberal democracy, leaving the western world in a potentially weaker position.<ref>'Francis Fukuyama, \"Reflections on the End of History, Five Years Later\", ''History and Theory'' 34, 2: \"World Historians and Their Critics\" (May 1995): 43.</ref> The fact that Marxism and fascism had been proven untenable for practical use while liberal democracy still thrived was reason enough to embrace the hopeful attitude of the Progressive era, as this hope for the future was what made a society worth struggling to maintain. Postmodernism, which, by this time, had become embedded in the cultural consciousness, offered no hope and nothing to sustain a necessary sense of community, instead relying only on lofty intellectual premises.<ref>'Francis Fukuyama, \"Reflections on the End of History, Five Years Later\", ''History and Theory'' 34, 2: World Historians and Their Critics (May 1995): 36.</ref> Being a work that both praised the ideals of a group that had fallen out of favor and challenged the premises of the group that had replaced them, it was bound to create some controversy.\n\nFukuyama has written a number of other books, among them ''Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity'' and ''[[Our Posthuman Future|Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution]]''. In the latter, he qualified his original \"end of history\" thesis, arguing that since biotechnology increasingly allows humans to control their own [[evolution]], it may allow humans to alter [[human nature]], thereby putting liberal democracy at risk.<ref>For a critical analysis of Fukuyama's bioethical argument, see: {{Cite journal | last1 = Jordaan | first1 = D.

He is a fierce enemy of [[transhumanism]], an intellectual movement asserting that [[posthuman]]ity is a desirable goal.\n\nIn another work, ''The Great Disruption: Human Nature and the Reconstruction of Social Order'', Fukuyama explores the origins of social norms, and analyses the current disruptions in the fabric of our moral traditions, which he considers as arising from a shift from the manufacturing to the information age. This shift is, he thinks, normal and will prove self-correcting, given the intrinsic human need for social norms and rules.\n\nIn 2006, in ''[[America at the Crossroads]]'', Fukuyama discusses the history of neoconservatism, with particular focus on its major tenets and political implications. He outlines his rationale for supporting the Bush administration, as well as where he believes it has gone wrong.\n\nIn 2008, Fukuyama published the book ''Falling Behind: Explaining the Development Gap Between Latin America and the United States'', which resulted from research and a conference funded by Grupo Mayan to gain understanding on why Latin America, once far wealthier than North America, fell behind in terms of development in only a matter of centuries. Discussing this book at a 2009 conference, Fukuyama outlined his belief that inequality within Latin American nations is a key impediment to growth. An unequal distribution of wealth, he stated, leads to social upheaval, which then results in stunted growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devex.com/blogs/17/blogs_entries/59071|title=Fukuyama: \"Social Agenda\" Needed to Combat Poverty in Latin America|author=Ryan Weddle|work=[[Devex]]|date=2009-02-18|accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref>\n\n===Neoconservatism===\nAs a key [[Reagan Administration]] contributor to the formulation of the [[Reagan Doctrine]], Fukuyama is an important figure in the rise of [[neoconservatism]], although his works came out years after [[Irving Kristol]]'s 1972 book crystallized neoconservatism.<ref>[[Irving Kristol]] (1972), ''On the Democratic Idea in America'', New York: Harper.</ref> Fukuyama was active in the [[Project for the New American Century]] think tank starting in 1997, and as a member co-signed the organization's 1998 [[Project for the New American Century#Open letter to President Clinton on Iraq|letter]] recommending that [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] support Iraqi insurgencies in the overthrow of then-President of [[Iraq]] [[Saddam Hussein]].<ref name=PNACClinton>{{cite web| url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909200819/http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm| archivedate=September 9, 2008| title=Letter to President Clinton on Iraq| accessdate=2008-08-16| author=[[Elliott Abrams|Abrams, Elliott]]| date=1998-01-26| format=PDF| display-authors=etal| deadurl=yes| df=mdy-all}}</ref> He was also among forty co-signers of [[Bill Kristol|William Kristol's]] September 20, 2001 letter to President [[George W.

The best instruments are setting a good example and providing education and, in many cases, money. The secret of development, be it political or economic, is that it never comes from outsiders, but always from people in the country itself. One thing the US proved to have excelled in during the aftermath of [[World War II]] was the formation of international institutions. A return to support for these structures would combine American power with international legitimacy. But such measures require a lot of patience. This is the central thesis of his 2006 work ''[[America at the Crossroads]]''.\n\nIn a 2006 essay in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' strongly critical of the invasion, he identified neoconservatism with [[Leninism]].

As a general rule, democracies don't work well if voters do not hold political parties accountable for failure.

Letters are shown from a variety of orientations.]]\n\n'''Fingerspelling''' (or '''dactylology''') is the representation of the [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s of a [[writing system]], and sometimes [[numeral system]]s, using only the hands. These '''manual alphabets''' (also known as '''finger alphabets''' or '''hand alphabets'''), have often been used in [[deaf education]], and have subsequently been adopted as a distinct part of a number of [[sign language]]s; there are about forty manual alphabets around the world.<ref>Zaitseva, Galina. ''Jestovaia rech. Dak't'ilologia''. (Sign speech. Dactylology.) Vlados. Moscow. 2004. p. 12</ref> Historically, manual alphabets have had a number of additional applications\u2014including use as [[cipher]]s, as [[mnemonic]]s, and in silent religious settings.\n\n==Forms of manual alphabets==\nAs with other forms of [[manual communication]], fingerspelling can be comprehended visually or [[tactile signing|tactually]]. The simplest visual form of fingerspelling is tracing the shape of letters in the air, or tactually, tracing letters on the hand. Fingerspelling can be one-handed such as in [[American Sign Language]], [[French Sign Language]] and [[Irish Sign Language]], or it can be two-handed such as in [[British Sign Language]].\n[[File:Bsl-sign-language-coloring-at-coloring-pages-for-kids-boys-dotcom.svg|thumb|alt=British Sign Language Chart Colouring Picture|British Sign Language Chart Colouring Page To Print]]\n[[File:Asl-sign-language-graffiti-coloring-at-coloring-pages-for-kids-boys-dotcom.svg|thumb|alt=American Sign Language Chart In Graffiti Coloring Picture|American Sign Language Chart In Graffiti Coloring Printable]]\n\n===Latin alphabet===\n\n====One-handed====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Alfabet palcowy2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Polish manual alphabet]]]] -->\n[[Image:Ukrainian manual alphabet 2003.JPG|thumb|left|[[Ukrainian manual alphabet]]]]\nThere are two families of manual alphabets used for representing the [[Latin alphabet]] in the modern world. The more common of the two<ref>Carmel, Simon (1982). ''International hand alphabet charts.'' [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)]]; 2nd edition. (June 1982). {{ISBN|0-9600886-2-8}}</ref> is mostly produced on one hand, and can be traced back to alphabetic signs used in Europe from at least the early 15th century. The alphabet, first described completely by Spanish monks, was adopted by the [[Charles-Michel de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e|Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e]]'s deaf school in Paris in the 18th century, and was then spread to deaf communities around the world in the 19th and 20th centuries via educators who had learned it in Paris. Over time, variations have emerged, brought about by natural [[Sound change|phonetic changes]] that occur over time, adaptions for local written forms with special characters or [[diacritic]]s (which are sometimes represented with the other hand), and avoidance of handshapes that are considered [[Obscene gesture|obscene]] in some cultures. The most widely used modern descendant is the [[American manual alphabet]].{{citation needed|reason=The so-called \"international one-handed fingerspelling\" (don't know the exact phrase, in German it's \"Internationales Einhand-Fingeralphabet\") is the most used fingerspelling in the world, the American manual alphabet - a dialect of the international one-handed fingerspelling only is used in ASL countries where english is spoken.|date=July 2015}}\n\n====Two-handed====\nTwo-handed manual alphabets are used by a number of deaf communities; one such alphabet is shared by users of [[British Sign Language]], [[Auslan]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]] (collectively known as the [[BANZSL]] language family), while another is used in [[Turkish Sign Language]]. Some of the letters are represented by iconic shapes, and in the BANZSL languages the vowels are represented by pointing to the fingertips.\n\nLetters are formed by a dominant hand, which is on top of or alongside the other hand at the point of contact, and a subordinate hand, which uses either the same or a simpler handshape as the dominant hand. Either the left or right hand can be dominant. In a modified tactile form used by [[deafblind]] people, the signer's hand acts as the dominant hand, and the receiver's hand becomes the subordinate hand.\n\nSome signs, such as the sign commonly used for the letter ''C'', may be one-handed.\n\n===Other alphabets===\nManual alphabets based on the [[Arabic alphabet]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=Kristina|title=New Evidence for Early Modern Ottoman Arabic and Turkish Sign Systems|journal=Sign Language Studies|date=Winter 2017|volume=17|issue=2|pages=172\u2013192|doi=10.1353/sls.2017.0001|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/648902}}</ref> the Ethiopian [[Ge'ez script]] and the Korean [[Hangul]] script use handshapes that are more or less iconic representations of the characters in the writing system. Some manual representations of non-Roman scripts such as Chinese, [[Japanese manual syllabary|Japanese]], Devanagari (e.g. the [[Nepali manual alphabet]]), Hebrew, Greek, Thai and Russian alphabets are based to some extent on the one-handed Latin alphabet described above. In some cases however, the \"basis\" is more theory than practice. Thus, for example, in the [[Japanese manual syllabary]] only the five vowels (\u30a2 /a/,\u3000\u30a4 /i/,\u3000\u30a6 /u/,\u3000\u30a8 /e/,\u3000\u30aa /o/) and the Ca (consonant plus \"a' vowel) letters (\u30ab /ka/, \u30b5 /sa/, \u30ca /na/, \u30cf /ha/, \u30de /ma/, \u30e4 /ya/, \u30e9 /ra/, \u30ef /wa/, but notably NOT \u30bf /ta/ which would resemble a somewhat rude gesture) derive from the [[American manual alphabet]]. In the [[Nepalese Sign Language|Nepali Sign Language]] it is only four \"letters\" which derive from the [[American manual alphabet]]: \u0905 /a/, \u092c /b/, \u092e /m/, and \u0930 /r/).\n\nThe [[Yugoslav manual alphabet]] represents characters from the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] as well as [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]].\n\n==Fingerspelling in sign languages==\nFingerspelling has been introduced into certain sign languages by educators, and as such has some structural properties that are unlike the visually motivated and multi-layered signs that are typical in deaf sign languages. In many ways fingerspelling serves as a bridge between the sign language and the oral language that surrounds it.\n\nFingerspelling is used in different sign languages and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s for different purposes. It may be used to represent words from an oral language which have no sign equivalent, or for emphasis, clarification, or when teaching or learning a sign language.\n\nIn [[American Sign Language]] (ASL), more lexical items are fingerspelled in casual conversation than in formal or narrative signing.<ref name=\"Frequency Characteristics\">[[Jill Morford|Morford, Jill]] Patterson, and MacFarlane, James (2003). ''Frequency Characteristics of American Sign Language.'' Sign Language Studies, Volume 3, Number 2, Winter 2003, pp. 213-225</ref> Different sign language [[speech community|speech communities]] use fingerspelling to a greater or lesser degree. At the high end of the scale,<ref>Padden, Carol A. (2003). ''How the alphabet came to be used in a sign language'', Sign Language Studies, 4.1. Gallaudet University Press</ref> fingerspelling makes up about 8.7% of casual signing in ASL,<ref name=\"Frequency Characteristics\" /> and 10% of casual signing in [[Auslan]].<ref>Schembri, A. & Johnston, T. (in press). ''Sociolinguistic variation in fingerspelling in Australian Sign Language (Auslan): A pilot study.''

[[SIL International|SIL]] Electronic Survey Report.</ref> and [[Italian Sign Language]] is also said to use very little fingerspelling, and mainly for foreign words.  Sign languages that make no use of fingerspelling at all include [[Kata Kolok]] and [[Ban Khor Sign Language]].\n\n[[Image:Bede finger alphabet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|AD 1494 illustration of a finger alphabet and counting system originally described by [[Bede]] in AD 710. The [[Greek alphabet]] is represented, with three additional letters making a total of 27, by the first three columns of numbers. The first two columns are produced on the left hand, and the next two columns on the right. [[Luca Pacioli]] modified the finger alphabet to the form shown above, where the handshapes for 1 and 10 on the left hand correspond to the 100s and 1000s on the right.<ref>Richter Sherman, C. (2000). ''Writing on Hands: Memory and Knowledge in Early Modern Europe.'' The Trout Gallery: Pennsylvania. p.168-9</ref>]]\nThe speed and clarity of fingerspelling also varies between different signing communities. In Italian Sign Language, fingerspelled words are relatively slow and clearly produced, whereas fingerspelling in standard [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) is often rapid so that the individual letters become difficult to distinguish, and the word is grasped from the overall hand movement. Most of the letters of the BSL alphabet are produced with two hands, but when one hand is occupied, the dominant hand may fingerspell onto an \"imaginary\" subordinate hand, and the word can be recognised by the movement. As with written words, the first and last letters and the length of the word are the most significant factors for recognition.\n\nWhen people fluent in sign language read fingerspelling, they do not usually look at the signer's hand(s), but maintain eye contact and look at the face of the signer as is normal for sign language.  People who are learning fingerspelling often find it impossible to understand it using just their [[peripheral vision]] and must look directly at the hand of someone who is fingerspelling.  Often, they must also ask the signer to fingerspell slowly.  It frequently takes years of expressive and receptive practice to become skilled with fingerspelling.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Gallego retablo panel 313.jpg|thumb|left|Alphabetic gestures have been discovered in hundreds of medieval and renaissance paintings.<ref>From a University of Arizona press release: \"An accidental discovery in 1991 of a manual alphabet in a 1444 painting of King Charles VII of France by [[Jean Fouquet]] has led Joseph Castronovo to decipher the \"artistic signatures\" in over 500 pieces of art work.\"[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9811&L=slling-l&P=2134 LISTSERV 14.4<!-- Bot generated title -->]<br>See also: Bragg, Lois (1996).

The practice of substituting letters for numbers and vice versa, known as [[gematria]], was also common, and it is possible that the two practices were combined to produce a finger calculus alphabet.

In 2017 a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine  ranked it the 74th best British film ever.<ref>[https://www.timeout.com/london/film/100-best-british-films#tab_panel_4 \"The 100 best British films\"]. ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]''. Retrieved 26 October 2017</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows the adventures of a group of friends through the eyes of Charles, a good-natured but socially awkward man living in London, who becomes smitten with Carrie, an American whom Charles keeps meeting at four weddings and a funeral.\n\nThe first wedding is in Somerset and is that of Angus and Laura, at which Charles is the best man. Charles and his single friends wonder whether they will ever get married. Charles meets Carrie and spends the night with her. Carrie pretends that, now they have slept together, they will have to get married, to which Charles endeavours to respond before realising she is joking. Carrie observes that they may have missed an opportunity and then returns to America.\n\nThe second wedding is that of Bernard and Lydia, a couple who became romantically involved at the previous wedding. Charles encounters Carrie again, but she introduces him to her fianc\u00e9, Sir Hamish Banks, a wealthy politician. At the reception, Charles finds himself seated with several ex-girlfriends who relate embarrassing stories about his inability to be discreet and afterwards bumps into Henrietta, known among Charles' friends as \"Duckface\", with whom he had a particularly difficult relationship. Charles retreats to an empty hotel suite, seeing Carrie and Hamish leave in a taxicab, only to be trapped in a cupboard after the newlyweds stumble into the room to have sex. After Charles awkwardly exits the room, Henrietta confronts him about his habit of \"[[serial monogamy]]\", telling him he is afraid of letting anyone get too close to him. Charles then runs into Carrie, and they end up spending another night together.\n\nA month later, Charles receives an invitation to Carrie's wedding. While shopping for a present, he coincidentally encounters Carrie and ends up helping her select her wedding dress. Carrie lists her 33 sexual partners. Charles later awkwardly tries confessing his love to her and hinting that he would like to have a relationship with her, to no avail.\n\nThe third wedding is that of Carrie and Hamish. Charles attends, depressed at the prospect of Carrie marrying Hamish. At the reception, Gareth instructs his friends to seek potential mates; Fiona's brother, Tom, stumbles through an attempt to connect with a woman until she reveals that she is the minister's wife, while Charles's flatmate, Scarlett, strikes up a conversation with an American named Chester. As Charles watches Carrie and Hamish dance, Fiona deduces his feelings about Carrie. When Charles asks why Fiona is not married, she confesses that she has loved Charles since they first met years earlier. Charles is appreciative and empathetic but does not requite her love. During the groom's toast, Gareth dies of a heart attack.\n\nAt Gareth's funeral, his partner Matthew recites the poem \"[[Funeral Blues]]\" by [[W. H. Auden]], commemorating his relationship with Gareth. Charles and Tom discuss whether hoping to find your \"one true love\" is just a futile effort and ponder that, while their [[clique]] have always viewed themselves as proud to be single, Gareth and Matthew were a \"married\" couple all the while.\n\nThe fourth wedding is ten months later. Charles has decided to marry Henrietta. However, shortly before the ceremony, Carrie arrives, revealing to Charles that she and Hamish are separated. Charles has a crisis of confidence, which he reveals to his deaf brother David and Matthew. During the ceremony, when the [[vicar]] asks whether anyone knows a reason why the couple should not marry, David, who was reading the [[vicar]]'s lips, asks Charles to translate for him, and says in [[British Sign Language|sign language]] that he suspects the groom loves someone else. The vicar asks whether Charles does love someone else, and Charles replies, \"I do.\" Henrietta punches Charles and the wedding is halted.\n\nCarrie visits Charles to apologise for attending the wedding. Charles confesses that, while standing at the altar, he realised that for the first time in his life he totally and utterly loved one person, \"and it wasn't the person standing next to me in the veil.\" Charles makes a proposal of lifelong commitment without marriage to Carrie, who accepts.\n\nHenrietta marries an officer in the [[Grenadier Guards]]; David marries his girlfriend Serena; Scarlett marries Chester; Tom marries his distant cousin Deirdre (whom he met, for the second time in 25 years, at Charles's wedding); Matthew finds a new partner; Fiona marries [[Prince Charles]]; and Charles and Carrie have a young son.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Charles\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Carrie\n* [[James Fleet]] as Tom\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Gareth\n* [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]] as Matthew\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Fiona\n* [[David Bower]] as David\n* [[Charlotte Coleman]] as Scarlett\n* [[Timothy Walker (actor)|Timothy Walker]] as Angus\n* [[Sara Crowe]] as Laura\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as Father Gerald\n* [[David Haig]] as Bernard\n* [[Sophie Thompson]] as Lydia\n* [[Corin Redgrave]] as Sir Hamish Banks\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Henrietta\n* [[Rupert Vansittart]] as George\n\n==Writing==\nScreenwriter Richard Curtis' own experiences as a wedding attendee inspired the premise for ''Four Weddings and a Funeral''.<ref name=\"15 Facts\">{{cite article| url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/73509/15-splendid-facts-about-four-weddings-and-funeral| title=15 Splendid Facts About Four Weddings and a Funeral| author=Roger Cormier| publisher=mentalfloss.com| date=2016-01-10| access-date=2018-06-30}}</ref> According to Curtis he began writing the script at age 34, after realizing he had attended 65 different weddings in an 11-year period.

He has commented on director Mike Newell's influence; \u201d''I come from a school where making it funny is what matters. Mike was obsessed with keeping it real.

Nonetheless, another $1.2 million was cut just before production began in the summer of 1993, forcing the film to be made in just 36 days with a final budget of \u20a42.7 million (appr. $4.4 million in 1994).<ref name=\"20 Years On\"/> The budget was so tight that extras had to wear their own wedding clothes, while Rowan Atkinson was retained as the Vicar for two of the weddings so production wouldn't have to pay another actor.<ref name=\"15 Facts\"/>\n\nFuture [[Home Secretary]] and [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Amber Rudd]] was given the credit of \"Aristocracy Coordinator\" after she arranged for several aristocrats to make uncredited appearances as wedding extras, including the then-[[Earl of Burlington]], [[Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire|Peregrine Cavendish]] and the [[Earl of Woolton]], who conveniently wore their own [[Morning dress|morning suits]].<ref name=\"15 Facts\"/>\n\nTo make Grant look more nerdy, the producers styled him with shaggy hair, glasses, and deliberately unflattering, ill-fitting clothes.<ref>{{cite video| title=The Wedding Planners: Making of Four Weddings and a Funeral| medium=dvd| publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment| year=2006}}</ref><ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2YoUbAEFTI| title=Hugh Grant Reviews His Most Iconic Movie Roles GQ| author=GQ| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2018-06-29| access-date=2018-07-01}}</ref> Grant was encouraged by director Mike Newell to mess up and trip over his lines, written in \"convoluted [[syntax]]\" as Grant describes them, in order to give Charles a stammering, nervous quality.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> Grant, who struggled with [[hay fever]] throughout filming, was unsure of Newell's direction and his own performance, which he thought was \"atrocious\"; on Newell he commented that: \"He seemed to be giving direction against what I thought were the natural beats of the comedy.

This song would later be adapted into \"Christmas Is All Around\" and sung by the character of Billy Mack in Richard Curtis' 2003 film ''[[Love Actually]]'', in which Grant also stars.\n\n==Release==\n===Publicity===\nThe box office receipts from the first five days of the film's general release in North America averaged $27,697 per screen, which so impressed the movie's distributor that it decided to spend lavishly on promotion, buying full-page newspaper ads and tv-spots totaling some $11 million, against a budget that had only amounted to $4.4 million.<ref name=\"20 Years On\"/>\n\nThe movie also benefited from much free publicity because of Grant's reception in the United States, where he became an instant [[sex symbol]] and undertook a successful media tour promoting the film. Producer Duncan Kenworthy stated that \"It was the most amazing luck that when Hugh went on the publicity trail he turned out to be incredibly funny, and very like the character of Charles.

Scuderia Ferrari (pronounced {{IPA-it|skude\u02c8ri\u02d0a|}}) literally means \"Ferrari Stable\" and is usually used to mean \"Team Ferrari.\" Ferrari bought, prepared, and fielded [[Alfa Romeo in motorsport|Alfa Romeo]] racing cars for [[gentleman driver]]s, functioning as the racing division of Alfa Romeo. In 1933, Alfa Romeo withdrew its in-house racing team and Scuderia Ferrari took over as its [[works team]]:<ref name=\"history\" /> the ''Scuderia'' received Alfa's Grand Prix cars of the latest specifications and fielded many famous drivers such as [[Tazio Nuvolari]] and [[Achille Varzi]]. In 1938, Alfa Romeo brought its racing operation again in-house, forming ''[[Alfa Corse]]'' in [[Milano]] and hired Enzo Ferrari as manager of the new racing department; therefore the Scuderia Ferrari was disbanded.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nIn September 1939, Ferrari left Alfa Romeo under the provision he would not use the Ferrari name in association with races or racing cars for at least four years.<ref name=\"history\" /> A few days later he founded ''[[Auto Avio Costruzioni]]'', headquartered in the facilities of the old ''Scuderia Ferrari''.<ref name=\"history\" /> The new company ostensibly produced machine tools and aircraft accessories. In 1940, Ferrari produced a race car \u2013 the [[Ferrari Tipo 815|Tipo 815]], based on a Fiat platform. It was the first Ferrari car and debuted at the 1940 [[Mille Miglia]], but due to [[World War II]] it saw little competition. In 1943, the Ferrari factory moved to [[Maranello]], where it has remained ever since. The factory was bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and subsequently rebuilt including a works for road car production.\n\n[[File:Ferrari 125 S fl.jpg|thumb|[[Ferrari 125 S|125 S]] replica]]\n[[File:Ferrari 166MM Barchetta.JPG|thumb|166MM [[Barchetta]] replica]]\n\nThe first Ferrari-badged car was the 1947 [[Ferrari 125 S|125 S]], powered by a 1.5&nbsp;L [[V12 engine]];<ref name=\"history\" /> Enzo Ferrari reluctantly built and sold his automobiles to fund [[Scuderia Ferrari]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of Ferrari In DK Engineering|url=http://www.dkeng.co.uk/company/The_History_of_Ferrari.html|date=14 September 2010|access-date=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Scuderia Ferrari'' name was resurrected to denote the factory racing cars and distinguish them from those fielded by customer teams.\n\nIn 1960 the company was restructured as a public corporation under the name SEFAC S.p.A.

An immediate result was an increase in available investment funds, and work started at once on a factory extension intended to transfer production from Fiat's Turin plant of the Ferrari engined Fiat Dino. New model investment further up in the Ferrari range also received a boost.\n\nIn 1988, Enzo Ferrari oversaw the launch of the [[Ferrari F40]], the last new Ferrari launched before his death later that year.

Ferrari would win one final title, the [[1972 World Sportscar Championship season|1972 World Championship of Makes]] before Enzo decided to leave [[sports car]] racing after 1973 and allow Scuderia Ferrari to concentrate solely on [[Formula One]].\n\nDuring Ferrari's seasons of the World Sportscars Championship, they also gained more wins at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], with the factory team earning their first in {{24hLM|1954}}.  Another win would come in {{24hLM|1958}}, followed by five consecutive wins from {{24hLM|1960}} to {{24hLM|1964}}. Luigi Chinetti's [[North American Racing Team]] (NART) would take Ferrari's final victory at Le Mans in {{24hLM|1965}}.\n\nAlthough Scuderia Ferrari no longer participated in sports cars after 1973, they have occasionally built various successful sports cars for [[Privateer (motorsport)|privateers]].  These include the [[Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer|BB 512 LM]] in the 1970s, the [[Ferrari 333 SP|333 SP]] which won the [[IMSA GT Championship]] in the 1990s, and currently the [[Ferrari 458|458]] GT2 and GT3 which are currently winning championships in their respective classes.\n\n=== Race cars for other teams ===\n\nThroughout its history, Ferrari has supplied racing cars to other entrants, aside from its own works [[Scuderia Ferrari]] team.\n\nIn the 1950s and '60s, Ferrari supplied Formula One cars to a number of private entrants and other teams. One famous example was [[Tony Vandervell]]'s team, which raced the [[Thinwall Special]] modified Ferraris before building their own [[Vanwall]] cars.

Such private teams as the American [[Risi Competizione]] and Italian [[AF Corse]] teams have been very successful with Ferrari GT racers over the years. This car, made for endurance sportscar racing to be competed against such racing versions of the [[Audi R8]], [[McLaren MP4-12C]], and [[BMW Z4 (E89)]] has proven to be successful, but not as successful as its predecessor, the [[Ferrari F430|F430]]. The [[Ferrari Challenge]] is a one make racing series for the [[Ferrari 458]]. The [[Ferrari FXX|FXX]] is not road legal, and is therefore only used for track events.\n\n== Road cars ==\n{{hatnote|For a complete list, including future and concept car models, see [[List of Ferrari road cars]].}}\n\n[[File:1947 Ferrari 166 Inter Touring Berlinetta 0043S - fvl.jpg|thumb|[[Ferrari 166 Inter|166 Inter]] Touring Berlinetta]]\n\nFerrari's first vehicle was the [[Ferrari 125 S|125 S]] sports/racing model. In 1949, the [[Ferrari 166 Inter|166 Inter]] was introduced. The presentation of this car marked the company's first move into the grand touring market, which continues to make up the bulk of Ferrari sales to the present day.\n\nMany early cars featured bodywork designed and customised by independent [[coachbuilder]]s such as [[Pininfarina]], [[Carrozzeria Scaglietti|Scaglietti]], [[Zagato]], [[Vignale]] and [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]].  Starting in the early 2010s with the [[Ferrari LaFerrari|LaFerrari]], focus was shifted to what is now the standard, Ferrari relying on in-house design from the Centro Stile Ferrari.\n\nThe [[Dino (automobile)|Dino]] was the first mid-engined Ferrari.  This layout would go on to be used in most Ferraris of the 1980s and 1990s. The Dino was produced primarily with a V6 engine, however a V8 model was also produced. Current road cars typically use V8 or V12 engines, with V8 models making up well over half of the marque's total production.  Historically, Ferrari has also produced [[Flat-12 engine|flat 12]] engines.\n\nFor a time, Ferrari built 2+2 versions of its mid-engined V8 cars. Although they looked quite different from their 2-seat counterparts, both the GT4 and Mondial were closely related to the 308 GTB.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe company has also produced several front-engined 2+2 cars, culminating in the current V12 model [[Ferrari GTC4Lusso|Lusso]] and V8 models [[Ferrari Portofino|Portofino]] and [[Ferrari GTC4Lusso|Lusso T]].  The [[Ferrari California|California]] is credited with initiating the popular current model line of V8 front-engined 2+2 grand touring performance sports cars.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nFerrari entered the mid-engined 12-cylinder fray with the Berlinetta Boxer in 1973.  The later Testarossa remains one of the most famous Ferraris.\n\n=== Current models ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! [[Ferrari 488|488 GTB]]\n! [[Ferrari 488#488 Spider|488 Spider]]\n!

Every Ferrari that comes out of Maranello is built to an individual customer's specification.  In this sense, each vehicle is a unique result of a specific client's desire.\n\nFerrari formalized this concept with its earlier Carrozzeria Scaglietti programme.  The options offered here were more typical such as racing seats, rear view cameras and other special trim.  In late 2011, Ferrari announced a significant update of this philosophy.  The Tailor Made programme allows clients to work with designers in Maranello to make decisions at every step of the process.  Through this program almost any trim, any exterior color or any interior material are possible. The program carries on the original tradition and emphasizes the idea of each car being unique.<ref name=\"Lingeman\"/>\n\n[[File:Ferrari Enzo - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (1) (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Enzo Ferrari (automobile)|Enzo Ferrari]]]]\n\n=== Supercars ===\n[[File:Ferrari Mythos Side.jpg|thumb|[[Ferrari Mythos|Mythos]] ]]\nThe 1984 [[Ferrari 288 GTO|288 GTO]] may be considered the first in the line of Ferrari supercars.

Thus, the [[Ferrari Dino|206]] was a 2.0&nbsp;L V6 powered vehicle, while the [[Ferrari 348|348]] used a 3.4&nbsp;L V8, although, for the [[Ferrari F355|F355]], the last digit refers to 5 valves per cylinder. Upon introduction of the [[Ferrari 360|360]] Modena, the digits for V8 models (which now carried a name as well as a number) refer only to total engine displacement. The numerical indication aspect of this name carried on to the [[Ferrari F430|F430]]; the F430's replacement, the [[Ferrari 458 Italia|458 Italia]], uses the same naming as the 206 and 348. The [[Ferrari 488|488]] uses the system formerly used by the V12 cars.\n* [[V12 engine|V12]] models used the displacement (in cubic centimetres) of one cylinder. Therefore, the famed 365 Daytona had a {{convert|4390|cc|cid|abbr=on}} V12. However, some newer V12-engined Ferraris, such as the [[Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano|599]], have three-number designations that refer only to total engine displacement or boxer-style designations such as the [nominally] six-litre, V12 [[Ferrari 612|612]].\n* [[Flat engine|Boxer 12]] models used the displacement in litres for the first digit and the number of cylinders for the next two digits. Therefore, the BB 512 was five litre flat 12 (a Berlinetta Boxer, in this case). However, the original Berlinetta Boxer was the [[Ferrari 365 GT4/BB|365 GT4 BB]], which was named in a similar manner to the V12 models.\n* Flagship models (aka \"halo cars\") use the letter F followed by the anniversary in years, such as the [[Ferrari F40|F40]] and [[Ferrari F50|F50]]. The [[Enzo Ferrari (car)|Enzo]] skipped this rule, although the F60 name was applied to a Ferrari Formula One car and is sometimes attached to the Enzo.\n* Some models, such as the 1980 [[Ferrari Mondial|Mondial]] and the 1984 [[Ferrari Testarossa|Testarossa]] did not follow a three-number naming scheme.\n\n[[File:Ferrari612SessentaEdition.jpg|thumb|[[Ferrari 612 Scaglietti|612 Scaglietti]] Sessanta Edition]]\n\nMost Ferraris were also given designations referring to their body style. In general, the following conventions were used:\n\n* '''M''' (\"Modificata\"), placed at the end of a model's number, denotes a modified version of its predecessor and not a complete evolution (see [[Ferrari Testarossa#F512 M|F512 M]] and [[Ferrari 575M Maranello|575 M Maranello]]).\n* '''GTB''' (\"Gran Turismo Berlinetta\") models are closed [[Berlinetta]]s, or [[coup\u00e9]]s.\n* '''GTS''' (\"Gran Turismo Spider\") in older models, are open Spiders, or [[Convertible (car)|convertibles]] (see [[Ferrari Daytona#365 GTB/4 and GTS/4|365 GTS/4]]); however, in more recent models, this suffix is used for [[targa top]] models (see [[Ferrari Dino#Dino 246 GT and GTS|Dino 246 GTS]], and [[Ferrari F355|F355 GTS]]; the exception being the [[Ferrari 348|348 TS]], which is the only targa named differently). The convertible models now use the suffix [[Roadster (automobile)|\"Spider\"]] (spelt \"i\") (see [[Ferrari F355|F355 Spider]], and [[Ferrari 360#Spider|360 Spider]]).\n* '''GTO''' (\"Gran Turismo Omologata\"), placed at the end of a model's number, denotes a modified version of its predecessor. They designate a model which has been designed and improved for racetrack use while still being street legal. Only three models bear those three letters:  the 250 GTO of 1962, the 288 GTO of 1984, and the 599 GTO of 2010.\n\nThis naming system can be confusing, as some entirely different vehicles used the same engine type and body style. Many Ferraris also had other names affixed (like Daytona) to identify them further. Many such names are actually not official factory names. The Daytona name commemorates Ferrari's triple success in the February 1967 [[24 Hours of Daytona]] with the [[Ferrari P|330 P4]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/wscc/ms1967.html |title=World Championship 1967 |publisher=Wspr-racing.com |accessdate=26 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514060332/http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/wscc/ms1967.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 }}</ref> Only in the 1973 Daytona 24 Hours, a [[Ferrari Daytona#365 GTB/4 and GTS/4|365 GTB/4]] run by NART (who raced Ferraris in America) ran second, behind a [[Porsche 911]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/wscc/ms1973.html#2 |title=World Championship 1973 |publisher=Wspr-racing.com |accessdate=26 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514060120/http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/wscc/ms1973.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe various [[Dino (automobile)|Dino]] models were named for Enzo's son, Dino Ferrari, and were marketed as Dinos by Ferrari and sold at Ferrari dealers\u2014for all intents and purposes they are Ferraris.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Ferrari added the letter \"F\" to the beginning of all models (a practice abandoned after the [[Ferrari Testarossa#F512 M|F512 M]] and [[Ferrari F355|F355]], but adopted again with the [[Ferrari F430|F430]], but not with its successor, the [[Ferrari 458]] ).\n\n== Identity ==\n[[File:Ferrari motif - Flickr - exfordy.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Cavallino Rampante'' with Ferrari lettering]]\n[[File:Usine Ferrari Maranello 0002.JPG|thumb|Ferrari head office and factory]]\n[[File:FBaracca 1.jpg|thumb|right|Count Francesco Baracca]]\n[[File:Coa fam ITA baracca.jpg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of the Baracca family]]\n\nThe famous symbol of the Ferrari race team is the ''Cavallino Rampante'' (\"prancing horse\") black prancing [[stallion]] on a yellow shield, usually with the letters ''S F'' (for ''Scuderia Ferrari''), with three stripes of green, white and red (the Italian national colors) at the top. The road cars have a rectangular badge on the hood (see picture at top of page), and, optionally, the shield-shaped race logo on the sides of both front wings, close to the door.\n\nOn 17 June 1923, Enzo Ferrari won a race at the Savio track in [[Ravenna]] where he met the Countess Paolina, mother of Count [[Francesco Baracca]], an ace of the [[Aeronautica Militare|Italian air force]] and national hero of [[World War I]], who used to paint a horse on the side of his planes. The Countess asked Enzo to use this horse on his cars, suggesting that it would bring him good luck. The original \"prancing horse\" on Baracca's airplane was painted in red on a white cloud-like shape, but Ferrari chose to have the horse in black (as it had been painted as a sign of grief on Baracca's squadron planes after the pilot was killed in action) and he added a [[Yellow#Electric yellow vs. process yellow|canary yellow]] background as this is the color of the city of Modena, his birthplace. The Ferrari horse was, from the very beginning, markedly different from the Baracca horse in most details, the most noticeable being the tail that in the original Baracca version was pointing downward.\n\nFerrari has used the ''cavallino rampante'' on official company stationery since 1929. Since the [[Spa 24 Hours]] of 9 July 1932, the ''cavallino rampante'' has been used on Alfa Romeos raced by Scuderia Ferrari.\n\nThe motif of a prancing horse is old, it can be found on ancient coins. A similar black horse on a yellow shield is the [[Coat of Arms]] of the German city of [[Stuttgart]], home of [[Mercedes-Benz]] and the design bureau of [[Porsche]], both being main competitors of Alfa and Ferrari in the 1930s. The city's name derives from ''Stutengarten'', an ancient form of the German word ''Gest\u00fct'', which translates into English as ''stud farm'' and into Italian as ''scuderia''. [[Porsche]] also includes the Stuttgart sign in its corporate logo, centred in the emblem of the state of [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Stuttgart's ''R\u00f6ssle'' has both rear legs firmly planted on the soil, like Baracca's horse, but unlike Ferrari's ''cavallino''.\n\n[[Fabio Taglioni]] used the ''cavallino rampante'' on his [[Ducati]] motorbikes, as Taglioni was born at Lugo di Romagna like Baracca, and his father too was a military pilot during WWI (although not part of Baracca's squadron, as is sometimes mistakenly reported). As Ferrari's fame grew, Ducati abandoned the horse- perhaps the result of a private agreement between the two companies.\n\n[[File:Logo avanti.png|thumb|upright|Austrian fuel stations]]\n\nThe ''cavallino rampante'' is the visual symbol of Ferrari. [[Cavallino Magazine]] uses the name, but not the logo. Other companies use similar logos: Avanti, an Austrian company operating over 100 filling stations, uses a prancing horse logo which is nearly identical to Ferrari's, as does [[Iron Horse Bicycles]] and [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].\n\n=== Colour ===\n{{Main|Rosso corsa}}\n\nSince the 1920s, Italian race cars of [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Maserati]] and later Ferrari and [[Abarth]] were (and often still are) painted in \"race red\" (''Rosso Corsa''). This was the customary [[List of international auto racing colors|national racing color]] of [[Italy]], as recommended between the World Wars by the organizations that later would become the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]. It refers to the nationality of the competing team, not that of the car manufacturer or driver. In that scheme, French-entered cars such as [[Bugatti]] were blue, German such as [[Auto Union]] and [[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport|Mercedes]] white (since 1934 also bare sheet metal [[Silver Arrows|silver]]), and British [[British racing green|green]] such as the mid-1960s [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[British Racing Motors|BRM]], for instance.\n\nFerrari won the 1964 World championship with [[John Surtees]] by competing the last two races in North America with cars painted in the US-American race colors white and blue, as these were not entered by the Italian factory themselves, but by the U.S.-based [[North American Racing Team]] (NART) team. This was done as a protest concerning arguments between Ferrari and the Italian Racing Authorities regarding the homologation of a new mid-engined Ferrari race car.\n\n== Corporate affairs ==\n\nIn 1963, Enzo Ferrari was approached by the [[Ford Motor Company]] about a possible buy out.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.rmauctions.com/lots/lot.cfm?lot_id=1071338 |title = Ford GT |publisher = rmauctions.com.com }}</ref> Ford audited Ferrari's assets but legal negotiations and talks were unilaterally cut off by Ferrari when he realized that the deal offered by Ford would not enable him to stay at the helm of the company racing program. [[Henry Ford II]] consequently directed his racing division to negotiate with [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]], [[Lola Cars|Lola]], and [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] to build a car capable of beating Ferrari on the world endurance circuit, eventually resulting in the production of the [[Ford GT40]] in 1964.\n\nAs the Ford deal fell through, FIAT approached Ferrari with a more flexible proposal and purchased controlling interests in the company in 1969. Enzo Ferrari retained a 10% share, which is currently owned by his son [[Piero Lardi Ferrari]].\n\nFerrari has an internally managed merchandising line that licenses many products bearing the Ferrari brand, including eyewear, pens, pencils, electronic goods, perfume, cologne, clothing, high-tech bicycles, watches, cell phones and laptop computers.\n\nFerrari also runs a museum, the [[Museo Ferrari]] in [[Maranello]], which displays road and race cars and other items from the company's history.\n\n=== Formula Uomo programme ===\n\nIn 1997 Ferrari launched a long term master planned effort to improve overall corporate efficiency, production and employee happiness.  The program was called Formula Uomo and became a case study in social sustainability.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://osha.europa.eu/en/tools-and-publications/publications/wellbeing-programme-at-ferrari-formula-uomo |title= Wellbeing Programme Ferrari Formula Uomo |work= Europa OSHA Case Studies |location=Europe | access-date=2018-07-13}}</ref>  It took over ten years to fully implement and included over \u20ac200 million (2008) in investment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/1080626851/ferrari-california-begins-production-on-new-line |title=Ferrari California Begins Production on New Line |website=worldcarfans.com |date=2008-06-26 |accessdate=2018-07-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Technical partnerships ===\n\nFerrari has had a long-standing relationship with [[Shell Oil]]. It is a technical partnership with Ferrari and Ducati to test as well as supply fuel and oils to the Formula One, MotoGP and World Superbike racing teams. For example, the [[Shell V-Power]] premium gasoline fuel has been developed with the many years of technical expertise between Shell and Ferrari.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shell.ca/home/content/can-en/products_services/on_the_road/fuels/shell_vpower/ |title=Ferrari and Shell V-Power |date=15 January 2009 |accessdate=20 January 2009 |publisher=Shell Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817132812/http://www.shell.ca/home/content/can-en/products_services/on_the_road/fuels/shell_vpower/ |archivedate=17 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nFerrari have had agreements to supply Formula One engines to a number of other teams over the years, and currently supply [[Sauber]] F1 Team, and [[Haas F1]] Team.\n\n=== Sales history ===\nAs of 2018, the estimated total of Ferrari built and sold cars in whole company history was about 190,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ferraris-online.com/pages/article.php?reqart=SCM_200804_SS |title=Crunching Ferrari\u2019s Global Numbers |publisher=Ferraris-online.com |date= |accessdate=22 June 2014 }}</ref>\n<div style=\"overflow:auto;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2| Year\n!colspan=100| Sales to end customers (number of type-approved vehicles)\n|- style=\"font-size:65%;

The degrees of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft [[guild]]s, those of [[Apprenticeship|Apprentice]], [[Journeyman]] or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and [[Master craftsman|Master Mason]]. The candidate of these three degrees is progressively taught the meanings of the symbols of Freemasonry, and entrusted with grips, signs and words to signify to other members that he has been so initiated. The initiations are part allegorical [[morality play]] and part lecture. The three degrees are offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as '''Freemasons''' or '''Masons'''. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by their own bodies (separate from those who administer the craft degrees).\n\nThe basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the [[Masonic Lodge|Lodge]]. The Lodges are usually supervised and governed at the regional level (usually coterminous with either a state, province, or national border) by a [[Grand Lodge]] or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate.\n\nModern Freemasonry broadly consists of two main recognition groups. [[Regular Freemasonry]] insists that a volume of scripture is open in a working lodge, that every member profess belief in a [[Supreme Being]], that no women are admitted (although, in some jurisdictions, those who transition to women after being initiated may stay; see below), and that the discussion of religion and politics is banned. [[Continental Freemasonry]] is now the general term for the jurisdictions which have removed some, or all, of these restrictions.\n\n==Masonic Lodge==\n[[File:Palazzo Roffia, galleria 00.JPG|thumb|alt=Italian lodge at Palazzo Roffia, Florence|Lodge in Palazzo Roffia, [[Florence]], set out for French (Moderns) ritual]]\n{{Main article|Masonic Lodge}}\nThe [[Masonic Lodge]] is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chevalierramsay.be/what-is-freemasonry/|title=What is Freemasonry|website=www.chevalierramsay.be|access-date=14 June 2017}}</ref> The Lodge meets regularly to conduct the usual formal business of any small organisation (pay bills, organise social and charitable events, elect new members, etc.).

Candidates for Freemasonry are progressively ''initiated'' into Freemasonry, first in the degree of Entered Apprentice. Some time later, in a separate ceremony, they will be ''passed'' to the degree of Fellowcraft, and finally they will be ''raised'' to the degree of Master Mason. In all of these ceremonies, the candidate is entrusted with passwords, signs and grips ([[secret handshakes]]) peculiar to his new rank.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/mas/syma/syma22.htm \"Words, Grips and Signs\"] H. L.

There also exist specialist Lodges where Masons meet to celebrate events, such as sport or Masonic research. The rank of Master Mason also entitles a Freemason to explore Masonry further through other degrees, administered separately from the Craft, or \"Blue Lodge\" degrees described here, but having a similar format to their meetings.<ref name=\"Johnstone\">Michael Johnstone, ''The Freemasons'', Arcturus, 2005, pp 101\u2013120</ref>\n\nThere is very little consistency in Freemasonry.

Every Masonic Lodge has a Master, two Wardens, a secretary and a treasurer. There is also a [[Tyler (Masonic)|Tyler]], or outer guard, who is always present outside the door of a working Lodge. Other offices vary between jurisdictions.<ref name=\"Johnstone\" />\n\nEach Masonic Lodge exists and operates according to a set of ancient principles known as the ''Landmarks of Freemasonry''. These principles have thus far eluded any universally accepted definition.<ref>[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/bernheim27.html Alain Bernheim, \"My Approach to Masonic History\"], ''Pietre Stones'', from address of 2011, retrieved 8 November 2013</ref>\n\n===Joining a lodge===\n[[File:Washington Masonic print.jpg|thumb|alt=Worshipful Master George Washington|Print from 1870 portraying [[George Washington]] as Master of his Lodge]]\n\nCandidates for Freemasonry will have met most active members of the Lodge they are joining before they are initiated. The process varies between jurisdictions, but the candidate will typically have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in the Lodge. In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. The onus is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, they are never invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If the candidate decides to proceed from here, the Lodge ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.<ref name=\"MLoE\">[http://www.masonic-lodge-of-education.com/become-a-free-mason.html \"How to become a Freemason\"], ''Masonic Lodge of Education'', retrieved 20 November 2013</ref>\n\nThe absolute minimum requirement of any body of Freemasons is that the candidate must be free, and considered to be of good character.<ref>[http://grande-loge.lu/?page_id=223 \"Comment devenir franc-ma\u00e7on?\"], Grande Loge de Luxembourg, retrieved 23 November 2013</ref> There is usually an age requirement, varying greatly between Grand Lodges, and (in some jurisdictions) capable of being overridden by a dispensation from the Grand Lodge. The underlying assumption is that the candidate should be a mature adult.<ref name=\"MLoE\"/>\n\nAdditionally, most Grand Lodges require the candidate to declare a belief in a [[Supreme Being]]. In a few cases, the candidate may be required to be of a specific religion. The form of Freemasonry most common in Scandinavia (known as the [[Swedish Rite]]), for example, accepts only Christians.<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/swedish_faq.html \"Swedish Rite FAQ\"], ''Grand Lodge of British Columbia & Yukon'', Accessed 19 November 2013</ref> At the other end of the spectrum, \"Liberal\" or [[Continental Freemasonry]], exemplified by the [[Grand Orient de France]], does not require a declaration of belief in any deity, and accepts atheists (a cause of discord with the rest of Freemasonry).<ref>[http://www.godf.org/index.php/pages/details/slug/foire-aux-questions \"Faut-il croire en Dieu?\"], Foire aux Questions, ''Grand Orient de France'', Retrieved 23 November 2013</ref><ref name=\"Buta\">[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/masonic_foreign_recognitions.html Jack Buta, \"The God Conspiracy, The Politics of Grand Lodge Foreign Relations\"], ''Pietre-Stones'', retrieved 23 November 2013</ref>\n\nDuring the ceremony of initiation, the candidate is expected to swear (usually on a volume of sacred text appropriate to his personal religious faith) to fulfil certain obligations as a Mason. In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as practicality and the law permit).<ref name=\"Johnstone\"/> There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, but on the whole, Freemasons are left to explore the craft in the manner they find most satisfying. Some will further explore the ritual and symbolism of the craft, others will focus their involvement on the social side of the Lodge, while still others will concentrate on the charitable functions of the lodge.<ref>[http://www.hampshirefreemasonry.com/social-events-and-activities \"Social events and activities\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109021223/http://www.hampshirefreemasonry.com/social-events-and-activities |date=9 January 2014 }}, ''Hampshire Province'', retrieved 20 November 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.masonic-lodges.com/masons.html \"Who are Masons, and what do they do?\"], ''MasonicLodges.com'', retrieved 20 November 2013</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\n\n===Grand Lodges===\n[[File:Freemasons' Hall, London.JPG|thumb|alt=Freemason's Hall, London|[[Freemasons' Hall, London|Freemasons Hall]], London, home of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]]]]\n{{Main article|Grand Lodge}}\nGrand Lodges and Grand Orients are independent and sovereign bodies that govern Masonry in a given country, state, or geographical area (termed a ''jurisdiction'').

When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed. There are many reasons one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are ''Exclusive Jurisdiction'' and ''Regularity''.<ref>[http://www.pilarlodge3freemasonry.freeservers.com/about_1.html Jim Bantolo, \"On Recognition\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314135120/http://www.pilarlodge3freemasonry.freeservers.com/about_1.html |date=14 March 2008 }}, Masonic Short Talk, ''Pilar lodge'', 2007, retrieved 25 November 2013</ref>\n\n====Exclusive Jurisdiction====\nExclusive Jurisdiction is a concept whereby only one Grand Lodge will be recognised in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to choose between them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.<ref>[http://www.themasonictrowel.com/ebooks/fm_freemasonry/Lang_-_History_Of_Freemasonry_in_NewYork_1922_raw.pdf Ossian Lang, \"History of Freemasonry in the State of New York\" (pdf)], 1922, pp135-140, ''Masonic Trowel eBooks''</ref>) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two overlapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).<ref>[http://www.bessel.org/exclartl.htm \"Exclusive Jurisdiction\"], ''Paul M.

Each Grand Lodge sets its own definition of what these landmarks are, and thus what is Regular and what is Irregular (and the definitions do not necessarily agree between Grand Lodges). Essentially, every Grand Lodge will hold that ''its'' landmarks (its requirements, tenets and rituals) are Regular, and judge other Grand Lodges based on those. If the differences are significant, one Grand Lodge may declare the other \"Irregular\" and withdraw or withhold recognition.<ref>[http://www.masonicum.lv/index.php?p=8857&lang=1506&pp=13574 \"Regularity in Freemasonry and its Meaning\"], ''Grand Lodge of Latvia'', retrieved 25 November 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/pope4.html Tony Pope, \"Regularity and Recognition\"], from ''Freemasonry Universal'', by Kent Henderson & Tony Pope, 1998, ''Pietre Stones'' website, retrieved 25 November 2013</ref>\n\nThe most commonly shared rules for Recognition (based on Regularity) are those given by the United Grand Lodge of England in 1929:\n* The Grand Lodge should be established by an existing regular Grand Lodge, or by at least three regular Lodges.\n* A belief in a supreme being and scripture is a condition of membership.\n* Initiates should take their vows on that scripture.\n* Only men can be admitted, and no relationship exists with mixed Lodges.\n* The Grand Lodge has complete control over the first three degrees, and is not subject to another body.\n* All Lodges shall display a volume of scripture with the square and compasses while in session.\n* There is no discussion of politics or religion.\n* \"Antient landmarks, customs and usages\" observed.<ref>''UGLE Book of Constitutions'', \"Basic Principles for Grand Lodge Recognition\", any year since 1930, page numbers may vary.</ref>\n\n==Other degrees, orders and bodies==\n{{See also|Masonic bodies|List of Masonic Rites}}\nBlue Lodge Freemasonry offers only three traditional degrees, and in most jurisdictions, the rank of past or installed master.

A moral lesson is attached to each of these tools, although the assignment is by no means consistent. The meaning of the symbolism is taught and explored through ritual.<ref name=\"Johnstone\" />\n\nAll Freemasons begin their journey in the \"craft\" by being progressively ''initiated, passed ''and'' raised'' into the three degrees of Craft, or Blue Lodge Masonry. During these three rituals, the candidate is progressively taught the meanings of the Lodge symbols, and entrusted with grips, signs and words to signify to other Masons that he has been so initiated. The initiations are part allegory and part lecture, and revolve around the construction of the [[Temple of Solomon]], and the artistry and death of his chief architect, [[Hiram Abiff]]. The degrees are those of ''Entered apprentice, Fellowcraft'' and ''Master Mason''. While many different versions of these rituals exist, with at least two different lodge layouts and versions of the Hiram myth, each version is recognisable to any Freemason from any jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Johnstone\" />\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the main themes of each degree are illustrated by [[tracing board]]s. These painted depictions of Masonic themes are exhibited in the lodge according to which degree is being worked, and are explained to the candidate to illustrate the legend and symbolism of each degree.<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/gmd1999/tb_history01.html Mark S. Dwor, \"Some thoughts on the history of the Tracing Boards\"], ''Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon'', 1999, retrieved 7 November 2013</ref>\n\nThe idea of Masonic brotherhood probably descends from a 16th-century legal definition of a ''brother'' as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another.

From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe during the course of the 18th century. The Grande Loge de France formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who exercised only nominal authority. His successor, the [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], reconstituted the central body as the Grand Orient de France in 1773. Briefly eclipsed during the [[French Revolution]], French Freemasonry continued to grow in the next century,<ref>[http://www.godf.org/index.php/pages/details/slug/histoire-de-la-franc-maconnerie ''Histoire de la Franc-ma\u00e7onnerie''], Grand Orient de France, retrieved 12 November 2013</ref> at first under the leadership of [[Alexandre Francois Auguste de Grasse]], Comte de Grassy-Tilly.

However the two jurisdictions continued in amity (mutual recognition) until events of the 1860s and 1870s drove a seemingly permanent wedge between them. In 1868 the ''Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of the State of Louisiana'' appeared in the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, recognised by the Grand Orient de France, but regarded by the older body as an invasion of their jurisdiction. The new Scottish Rite body admitted blacks. The resolution of the Grand Orient the following year that neither colour, race, nor religion could disqualify a man from Masonry prompted the Grand Lodge to withdraw recognition, and it persuaded other American Grand Lodges to do the same.<ref>[http://bessel.org/masrec/france.htm Paul Bessel, \"U.S. Recognition of French Grand Lodges in the 1900s\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410074658/http://bessel.org/masrec/france.htm |date=10 April 2006 }}, from ''Heredom: The Transactions of the Scottish Rite Research Society'', vol 5, 1996, pp 221\u2013244, ''Paul Bessel'' website, retrieved 12 November 2013</ref>\n\nA dispute during the [[Lausanne Congress of Supreme Councils of 1875]] prompted the Grand Orient de France to commission a report by a Protestant pastor which concluded that, as Freemasonry was not a religion, it should not require a religious belief. The new constitutions read, \"Its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity\", the existence of God and the immortality of the soul being struck out. It is possible that the immediate objections of the United Grand Lodge of England were at least partly motivated by the political tension between France and Britain at the time.

This spell also saw Fulham invited to the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]], which saw the club draw four out of four games in 1972\u201373 season. This preceded a period of high-profile signings for the club under [[Alec Stock]] in the mid-1970s, including [[Alan Mullery]] and [[Bobby Moore]]. Fulham reached their only FA Cup final in 1975, having won their first semi-final in five attempts. The club then lost to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the final.

Then called \"Fulham Rugby League,\" they played at Craven Cottage until moving away from the parent club in 1984.\n\nIn 1978, Fulham had signed Gordon \"Ivor\" Davies who, during two spells at Fulham, became the club's leading goalscorer of all time with a total of 178 goals in all competitions; the record still stands. Fulham narrowly missed out on back-to-back promotions to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], losing 1\u20130 to Derby County away on the last day of the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383 season]] \u2013 although the match was abandoned after 88 minutes due to a [[pitch invasion]] and inexplicably never replayed or finished. The side which had shown so much promise was quickly sold off as the club were in debt, so it was little surprise when the club were relegated again to the Third Division in 1986. The club nearly went out of business in 1987 via an ill-advised merger attempt with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. It was only the intervention of ex-player [[Jimmy Hill]] that allowed the club to stay in business as a re-structured Fulham FC 1987 Ltd.

Frenchman [[Jean Tigana]] was put in charge and, having signed a number of young stars (including French striker [[Louis Saha]]), he guided Fulham to their third promotion in five seasons in the [[2000\u201301 in English football#Football League First Division|2000\u201301 season]], giving Fulham top-flight status for the first time since 1968. Fulham once again amassed 101 points out of a possible 138 in their scintillating title run, which was crowned with an open-top bus parade down [[Fulham Palace Road]]. They are the only team to have twice reached 100 points in a season. During the season, Chris Coleman was involved in a car crash that put him out of action for well over a year and eventually ended his playing career after he failed to make a sufficient recovery.

Fulham then won a crucial match against fellow strugglers [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] at Craven Cottage, leaving survival in the club's own hands. Barring a goal-rush from fellow strugglers [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], a win against a [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] side looking ahead to their fourth FA Cup final would guarantee survival.\n\nWith 15 minutes to play at Portsmouth, Fulham were drawing, and with Birmingham City and Reading leading comfortably against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and Derby County respectively, they looked likely to be relegated. However, Fulham earned a free-kick with 76 minutes played; Jimmy Bullard's delivery found [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]], who headed home the decisive goal, sparking manic celebrations from the travelling fans. Hodgson had ensured survival against all odds, breaking several club records in the process and cementing his place in Fulham folklore.

In 2015, the song was voted by the British public as the nation's 14th favourite [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1980s|1980s number one]] in a poll for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Formation===\nOn the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to the group's first single, Johnson explained that the group's name derived from a page from ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, featuring the headline \"Frankie Goes Hollywood\" and a picture of [[Frank Sinatra]], although the magazine page Johnson referred to was actually a pop art poster by [[Guy Peellaert]]. The original group named \"Frankie Goes to Hollywood\" dates from 1980.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.ztt.com/bio_frankie.html |title= FGTH Biography |publisher= Ztt.com |accessdate= 18 April 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080927191040/http://www.ztt.com/bio_frankie.html |archivedate= 27 September 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe nucleus of the group emerged from the late 1970s Liverpool [[punk subculture|punk]] scene. Lead singer Johnson had played bass with [[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]] and had also released two solo singles. Local musicians Peter Gill (drums), [[Jed O'Toole]] (bass), and O'Toole's cousin Brian Nash (guitar) initially joined Johnson, calling themselves the Sons of Egypt. This line-up secured a number of small local gigs before disbanding.\n\nThe group was reprised when Johnson joined Mark O'Toole (bass) and Peter \"Ped\" Gill to form FGTH. During a particularly fluid period of personnel changes, Jed O'Toole joined FGTH on guitar, and a female vocalist, Sonia Mazumder, was also a band member for the first Frankie gig at the Leeds nightclub \"The Warehouse\", supporting Hambi & The Dance. Paul Rutherford &ndash; a member of the headline act who had also sung in seminal Liverpool punk band [[The Spitfire Boys]] &ndash; apparently got so caught up in Frankie's performance that he effectively replaced Mazumder that very night. The new all-male musical line-up subsequently toured locally with a leather-clad female duo known as \"The Leatherpets\" and managed to fund promotional videos and demos, despite being eventually turned down by both [[Arista Records]] and [[Phonogram Inc.]] In October 1982, the group recorded a [[John Peel#Peel sessions|John Peel Session]] for [[BBC Radio 1]], comprising the originals \"Krisco Kisses\", \"Two Tribes\", \"Disneyland\", and \"The World Is My Oyster\". Around this time Jed O'Toole left the group, to be replaced by the returning Brian Nash.\n\nIn February 1983, the group was invited to record a video for \"Relax\" by the [[Channel 4]] show ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'' at the Liverpool State Ballroom. After the broadcast, the Peel session was repeated on radio, and a new session recorded for the BBC, comprising \"[[Welcome to the Pleasuredome (song)|Welcome to the Pleasuredome]]\", \"The Only Star in Heaven\" and \"Relax\". These performances, along with a repeat of the ''Tube'' video, convinced [[Trevor Horn]] to sign the group for his new label, [[ZTT Records]], in May 1983.\n\n===\"Relax\"===\n{{main|Relax (song)}}\n\"[[Relax (song)|Relax]]\" was released by ZTT in October 1983, with production and remix directed by Trevor Horn, received a modicum of airplay, allowing it steady progress into the UK Top 40. Following a debut on the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on 5 January 1984 while at number 35, the single rose to number six the following week.\n\nOn 11 January 1984, BBC Radio 1 disc jockey [[Mike Read]] was playing the record on his show when he noticed the front cover design (by [[Yvonne Gilbert]]). Read apparently became outraged by the \"overtly sexual\" nature of both the record sleeve and the printed lyrics, which prompted him to remove the disc from the turntable live on air, branding it \"obscene\".<ref name=\"BBCNewsMagazine\">{{cite web|last=Duffy |first=Jonathan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3395823.stm |title=Banned on the run |work=BBC News Magazine|date=14 January 2004 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nTwo days later &ndash; almost three months after the single's initial release, and just eight days after the group's ''Top of the Pops'' appearance &ndash; the BBC banned the record from all its TV and radio outlets.<ref name=\"BBCNewsMagazine\" /> \"Relax\" immediately shot to [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1980s|Number One in the UK charts]] and stayed there for five weeks, during which time the BBC could not feature the nation's best-selling single on ''Top of the Pops''.\n\nThe original video<ref>Title on YouTube is \"Frankie Goes To Hollywood - Relax (Uncensored)\"</ref> was directed by [[Bernard Rose (director)|Bernard Rose]] and depicted a gay [[BDSM|S&M]] parlour where the band members were admired by muscular [[leather subculture|leathermen]], a bleached blonde [[drag queen]], and a large-bodied man dressed as a [[Roman emperor]]. The video featured a scene where one of the band members wrestled a live tiger, to the admiration of the clubgoers, and ended where the \"emperor\" was so excited he shimmied out of his [[toga]]. Filmed in the unused East London theatre [[Wilton's Music Hall]], it was promptly banned by both the BBC and [[MTV]], resulting in the production of a substitute video directed by filmmaker [[Brian De Palma]] to coincide with the release of his film ''[[Body Double]]''.\n\nThe BBC lifted its ban on \"[[Relax (song)|Relax]]\" at the end of 1984 to allow the band to perform it on the Christmas edition of ''Top of the Pops'' (it had been, aside from [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] of which Holly Johnson was a participant, the biggest-selling single of the year).\n\n[[File:Frankie Two Tribes 12 inch picture disk.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Twelve-inch picture disc of \"Two Tribes\" with video image]]\n\n===\"Two Tribes\"===\n\"Relax\" remained in the charts when the follow-up, \"[[Two Tribes]]\", was released in May 1984. The anti-conflict song was given an aggressively topical [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] slant. Featuring sirens, the unmistakable voice of [[Patrick Allen]] (who had voiced the [[British Government]]'s actual nuclear warning ads, ''[[Protect and Survive]]'', two years earlier) and another innovative electronic backing, it went straight into the UK charts at Number One and stayed there for nine weeks (the first single to do so since [[John Travolta]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s \"[[You're the One That I Want]]\" in 1978), with total sales exceeding 1.5 million copies and becoming one of the top 30 best-selling records in the UK ever.\n\nDirected by [[Kevin Godley]] and [[Lol Creme]], the video featured lookalikes of [[Second Cold War|Cold War]] leaders [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]] wrestling in a marquee while band members and others laid bets on the outcome. Ultimately, the audience \u2013 consisting of other world leaders \u2013 were brought into the fight, and eventually Earth was seen to explode.\n\n\"Two Tribes\" was a successful single in its own right, but its reign at the top of the charts was made even more notable by the continuing success of its predecessor. \"Relax\" had made a natural decline down the charts by May 1984, but on the release of \"Two Tribes\" its sales began to increase again, to the extent that FGTH held the top two spots in the UK charts during July 1984, the first active group to do so since the early 1960s.\n\nThe release of \"Two Tribes\" also coincided with an extensive and iconic T-shirt marketing campaign during the British summer of 1984, featuring such slogans as \"Frankie Say War! Hide Yourself\" and \"Frankie Say Relax Don't Do It!\"[[File:Frankie Say War! Hide Yourself\" t-shirt.jpg|right|thumb|200px|\"Frankie Say War! Hide Yourself\" T-shirt.]]\n\n===\"The Power of Love\"===\nFGTH released a third single, \"[[The Power of Love (Frankie Goes to Hollywood song)|The Power of Love]]\", at the end of 1984. Unlike the earlier singles, this song was a slower-paced ballad, but it also went to Number One in December and making the band the first act for two decades (since [[Gerry & the Pacemakers]], a fellow Liverpool band, in 1963) to achieve chart-toppers with its first three releases. The video was not banned on this occasion but still caused trouble for the group \u2013 because it depicted a nativity scene (and on its first showing did not feature any members of the band, who were subsequently added as picture framing).\n\nThe song's release was preceded by an advertising campaign that, cheekily, declared it to be the band's third number one single, as if this was a [[wikt:fait accompli|fait accompli]]. The [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] project, for which Johnson recorded a message for the B-side, meant that FGTH managed only one week at the top this time before it was replaced by \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\"\n\n===\"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\"===\nThe title track from FGTH's album, \"[[Welcome to the Pleasuredome (song)|Welcome to the Pleasuredome]]\", was released as a fourth single in March 1985. Early promotional posters for the single proclaimed it as \"their fourth number one\", even prior to the single's release. However, the single peaked at Number 2. The twelve-inch singles featured [[Greek mythology]]/[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] spoken introduction. [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]] narrates on the second 12\", known as the \"fruitness\" mix.\n\nOnly one sole new track appeared in the next eighteen months; \"Disneyland\", was released on the ZTT Records \"Zang Tuum Tumb Sampled\" album in late 1985.\n\n===Return and decline===\nIn 1986, FGTH appeared at the Montreux Rock Festival which was broadcast on UK television. This performance saw the first airings of two future singles, namely \"[[Rage Hard]]\" and \"[[Warriors of the Wasteland]]\". Both versions were different from the versions eventually released. In August 1986, the long-awaited new Frankie Goes to Hollywood single, \"Rage Hard\", was released, reaching number 4 in the UK. Initially showcased promotionally with songs like \"Warriors of the Wasteland\", the group's sound had developed a significantly harder edge with a less flamboyant, more nitty-gritty lyrical side. The album, ''Liverpool'', was released in October 1986 and reached UK No.&nbsp;5. It was generally panned by the music press{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} and chart returns declined rapidly with the follow-up singles \"Warriors of the Wasteland\" (No.&nbsp;19) and \"[[Watching the Wildlife]]\" (No.&nbsp;28). The group meanwhile threatened to implode of its own accord, in the course of a tour promoting the new album. Johnson kept himself markedly separate from the rest of the band when offstage at this period, tensions becoming exacerbated during a backstage altercation between Johnson and O'Toole at [[Wembley Arena]] in January 1987, reflecting the generally collapsing relationship between lead singer and the rest of the band. Things were so bad that fellow Liverpudlian singer [[Pete Wylie]] was approached to replace Johnson but declined the offer.<ref>{{cite episode | title = The New Merseybeat| series = Rock Family Trees | airdate = 1995}}</ref> FGTH completed the tour, but Johnson ultimately left the group thereafter, citing musical estrangement.\n\n===Aftermath===\nIn the aftermath of the group split, Johnson was offered a solo recording agreement with [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] Records. However, ZTT, which maintained they had invested heavily in ''Liverpool'' (to the extent that the [[digital recording]] system used to record the album was very nearly treated as a sixth member of the band on the sleeve of the \"Warriors of the Wasteland\" single), had other ideas, and promptly sued Johnson in an attempt to hold him to his original contract with the label. Among other things, ZTT believed that as a departing member of FGTH, Johnson was required to release all solo material through the label until the band's original multiple-album agreement was fulfilled. The suit was bitterly fought, exposing the inner workings of the ZTT/Frankie machine to a giddy [[Music of the United Kingdom|UK music]] press.\n\nAfter two years, the High Court found in Johnson's favour, holding that the highly restrictive terms of the contract constituted an unreasonable [[restraint of trade]]. The court case also effectively freed the remaining members of FGTH from their ZTT contract.\n\n===Later years===\nJohnson's solo career at MCA commenced in 1989, with a succession of high-placed singles and the number one album ''Blast''. The remix collection ''Hollelujah'' followed, trailed by a second [[studio album]], ''Dreams That Money Can't Buy''. However, Johnson's relations with MCA cooled with this release, and he would ultimately become a reclusive but successful painter, after announcing in 1993 that he was HIV-positive. The following year, Johnson recounted his version of Frankie's history in his autobiography ''A Bone in My Flute''. His self-issued 1999 album ''Soulstream'' included a re-recording of \"The Power of Love\", which was also released as a single.\n\nPaul Rutherford, the other openly gay member of the band, released the partially [[ABC (band)|ABC]] produced album ''Oh World'' and a handful of singles before retiring with his New Zealander partner to [[Waiheke Island]].\n\nThe \"other three\", as ''[[Smash Hits]]'' labelled them, continued to work together in what turned out to be a vain attempt to resurrect \"Frankie\" with various singers including Dee Harris from [[Fashion (band)|Fashion]] and Grant Boult (Jeckyl Ice) from The Premise, who had opened the shows on the band's UK and European tours. Under the name Boss Dog, with Boult on vocals, the band were offered a major deal with [[Virgin Records]] but on the condition they work as Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Johnson challenged the use of the name and the deal soured. Boult and Brian Nash continued with the material written by The Shuffle Brothers and under the name Low they released \"Tearing My soul Apart\" in 1992 on Swanyard Records. As \"Nasher\", Nash released a 2002 [[solo album]] entitled ''Ripe''. Ped worked behind the scenes and scored a top ten hit with the group \"Lovestation\". Mark O'Toole moved to Florida and played with punk outfit \"Trapped by Mormons\".\n\nThe band's name lived on to the extent that re-issues of \"Relax\" and \"The Power of Love\" both returned to the UK Top 10 in 1993. Remixes of \"The Power of Love\" (which became a dance anthem from its original ballad format) and \"Two Tribes\" were Top 20 hits again in 2000, while \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" also got commercially successful remix treatment, to the extent of a Top 20 placing four years earlier.\n\nThe group's first two singles appeared sixth and 22nd respectively in the official [[List of best-selling singles in the United Kingdom|all-time UK best-selling singles list]] issued in 2002.\n\n====American impostor group====\nIn 1998, a band calling itself alternately \"Frankie Goes to Hollywood\" and \"The New Frankie Goes to Hollywood Featuring Davey Johnson\" began to tour the United States.<ref name=\"FrankieFake\">{{cite news|last1=Prince|first1=David J.|title=Frankie Goes to Alabama?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=grUyWt6neOgC&lpg=PA128&ots=q638QIdnnl&dq=imposter%20frankie%20goes%20to%20hollywood&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=SPIN|issue=Vol. 16 No. 9|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|date=1 September 2000|pages=124\u2013130|language=en}}</ref> The band consisted of none of the original members of the band and formed without their knowledge or consent.

Mark O'Toole, who had been living in Florida, became aware of the band and warned concert promoters not to hire them.<ref name=\"FrankieFake\"/> Likewise, [[A Flock of Seagulls]] frontman [[Mike Score]], who had been a Liverpool acquaintance of the members of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, kicked the impostor band off his tour after discovering they were a fraud.<ref name=\"FrankieFake\"/> After Holly Johnson contacted the trade magazine ''[[Pollstar]]'' to confirm that the American-based act was unauthorized, the impostor band was dropped by a booking agent, but continued to be booked by small clubs throughout the southern United States.<ref name=\"FrankieFake\"/> The fake group continued to perform until at least September 2000, when a feature on the controversy was published in that month's issue of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''.<ref name=\"FrankieFake\"/>\n\n===Reunion and comeback===\nIn 2003, the [[VH-1]] program ''[[Bands Reunited]]'' brought Johnson, Rutherford, Gill, Nash, and Mark O'Toole together, in the hope of their agreeing to perform impromptu on the show. However, a reunion performance did not transpire. Both Johnson and Nash had reservations about performing at short notice in the contrived manner dictated by the TV show format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx2_i-yhDsg|title=Frankie Goes To Hollywood - Bands reunited part 4|first=|last=prodyparrot|date=26 November 2010|accessdate=22 January 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, a celebration of the 25th anniversary of [[Trevor Horn]]'s involvement in the music industry a special concert took place at Wembley Arena in November, featuring three of the original FGTH line-up, Mark O'Toole, Peter (Ped) Gill and Paul Rutherford and another former member, Jed O'Toole. Original vocalist Johnson, who announced via the Internet that he would not be appearing and guitarist Nash, who declined to appear for his own reasons, did not take part. Jed O'Toole took over guitar duties for the event, whilst an open audition was held for a new singer for the concert. [[Ryan Molloy]] was recruited as a result.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3969225.stm|title=Frankie's new vocalist unveiled|website=BBC|access-date=2017-10-08}}</ref>\n\nThe same lineup reunited for a tour in 2005 playing festivals in Europe.

The band became increasingly focused on the release of a new album during 2007. However, in early April 2007 came the news that Gill, Rutherford, J. O'Toole and Molloy had formed '''Forbidden Hollywood''' to play their new songs alongside old FGTH material. This was to avoid legal issues with Holly Johnson over use of the Frankie Goes to Hollywood name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=22059_0_2_0_C |title=Former Frankie Goes to Hollywood members start new band: Forbidden Hollywood - Frankie Goes To Hollywood news at |publisher=Side-line.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibdbooking.de/v1/?page_id=29 |title=ibdbooking.de |publisher=ibdbooking.de |date= |accessdate=18 April 2014}}</ref> Live dates were announced but in June 2007, these were cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibdbooking.de/v1/?p=103 |title=ibdbooking.de |publisher=ibdbooking.de |date= |accessdate=18 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Band members==\n* [[Peter Gill (FGTH drummer)|Peter Gill]] \u2013 drums <small>(1980\u20131987, 2004\u20132007)</small><ref name=EntLaw>{{cite book | last=Smartt | first=Ursula | date=2011 | title=Media and Entertainment Law | page=389 | publisher=[[Routledge]] | location=London | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCLR5fyc7N0C&pg=PA389 | access-date=March 17, 2018 | isbn=0-415-66515-9}}</ref>\n* [[Mark O'Toole (musician)|Mark O'Toole]] \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(1980\u20131987, 2004\u20132007)</small><ref name=EntLaw />\n* [[Holly Johnson]] \u2013 lead vocals <small>(1980\u20131987)</small>{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<ref name=EntLaw />\n* [[Jed O'Toole]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(1980\u20131982, 1984, 1987, 2004\u20132007)</small>{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<ref name=EntLaw />\n* Sonia Mazumder \u2013 backing vocals <small>(1980)</small>{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* [[Paul Rutherford (singer)|Paul Rutherford]] \u2013 backing vocals, keyboards, tambourine, dancing <small>(1980\u20131987, 2004\u20132007)</small><ref name=EntLaw />\n* [[Brian Nash]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(1982\u20131987)</small>{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* [[Ryan Molloy]] \u2013 lead vocals <small>(2004\u20132007)</small>{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Awards and Nominations==\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

The utilized amounts of the various inputs determine the quantity of output according to the relationship called the [[production function]]. There are three ''basic'' resources or factors of production: [[land (economics)|land]], [[Labour economics|labor]], and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. The factors are also frequently labeled \"producer goods or services\" to distinguish them from the goods or services purchased by consumers, which are frequently labeled \"consumer goods\". All three of these are required in combination at a time to produce a commodity.\n\nThere are two types of factors: ''primary'' and ''secondary''. The previously mentioned primary factors are [[land (economics)|land]], [[Labour economics|labor]] (the ability to work), and [[Capital (economics)|capital goods]].\nMaterials and energy are considered secondary factors in classical economics because they are obtained from land, labor, and capital. \nThe primary factors facilitate production but neither becomes part of the product (as with [[raw material]]s) nor becomes significantly transformed by the production process (as with fuel used to power machinery). Land includes not only the site of production but also [[natural resource]]s above or below the soil. Recent usage has distinguished [[human capital]] (the stock of knowledge in the [[labor force]]) from labor.<ref>[[Paul A. Samuelson]] and [[William D. Nordhaus]] (2004).

The great questions of Rent, Wages, and Profits must be explained by the proportions in which the whole produce is divided between landlords, capitalists, and laborers, and which are not essentially connected with the doctrine of value. (Ricardo Johnson\n, David,1820; 1951, \"The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo\", edited by [[Piero Sraffa]], 10 Volumes, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1951\u20131955, VIII, p. 197.</ref>\n\nDifferences are most stark when it comes to deciding which factor is the most important.\n\n=== Physiocracy ===\n[[Physiocracy]] (from the Greek for \"government of nature\") is an economic theory developed by a group of 18th century Enlightenment French economists who believed that the wealth of nations was derived solely from the value of \"land agriculture\" or \"land development\" and that agricultural products should be highly priced\n\n=== Classical ===\n[[File:Sabah Sarawak labour advert Kuala Lumpur.JPG|thumb|right|An advertisement for labor from Sabah and Sarawak, seen in Jalan Petaling, Kuala Lumpur.]]\nThe [[classical economics]] of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], and their followers focus on physical [[Resource (types and developments)666|resources]] in defining its factors of production and discuss the distribution of cost and value among these factors. Adam Smith and David Ricardo referred to the \"component parts of price\"<ref>Adam Smith (1776), ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', B.I, Ch.6, Of the Component Parts of the Price of Commodities in paragraph I.6.9.</ref> as the costs of using:\n* [[Land (economics)|Land]] or [[natural resource]] \u2014 naturally occurring goods like water, air, soil, minerals, flora, fauna and climate that are used in the creation of products. The payment given to a landowner is [[Renting|rent]], loyalties, commission and goodwill.\n* [[Labor (economics)|Labor]] \u2014 human effort used in production which also includes technical and marketing expertise. The payment for someone else's labor and all income received from one's own labor is [[Returns (economics)#Wages|wages]]. Labor can also be classified as the physical and mental contribution of an employee to the production of the good(s).\n* [[Capital (economics)|The capital stock]] \u2014 human-made goods which are used in the production of other goods. These include machinery, tools, and buildings.  They are of two types, fixed and working. Fixed are one time investments like machines, tools and working consists of liquid cash or money in hand and raw material \n\nThe classical economists also employed the word \"capital\" in reference to money. Money, however, was not considered to be a factor of production in the sense of capital stock since it is not used to directly produce any good. The return to loaned money or to loaned stock was styled as interest while the return to the actual proprietor of capital stock (tools, etc.) was styled as profit. See also [[Returns (economics)|returns]].\n\n=== Marxism ===\nMarx considered the \"elementary factors of the labor-process\" or \"[[productive forces]]\" to be:\n* Labor\n* The subject of labor (objects transformed by labor)\n* The instruments of labor (or [[means of labor]]).<ref>\"[[Das Kapital]]\", chapter 7, section 1.</ref>\n\nThe \"subject of labor\" refers to natural resources and raw materials, including land. The \"instruments of labor\" are tools, in the broadest sense. They include factory buildings, infrastructure, and other human-made objects that facilitate labor's production of goods and services.\n\nThis view seems similar to the classical perspective described above. But unlike the classical school and many economists today, Marx made a clear distinction between labor actually done and an individual's \"[[labor power]]\" or ability to work. Labor done is often referred to nowadays as \"effort\" or \"labor services.\" Labor-power might be seen as a [[stock and flow|stock]] which can produce a [[stock and flow|flow]] of labor.\n\nLabor, not labor power, is the key factor of production for Marx and the basis for Marx's [[labor theory of value]]. The hiring of labor power only results in the production of goods or services (\"[[use value|use-values]]\") when organized and regulated (often by the \"management\"). How much labor is actually done depends on the importance of conflict or tensions within the labor process.\n\n=== Neoclassical economics ===\n[[Neoclassical economics]], one of the branches of [[mainstream economics]], started with the classical factors of production of land, labor, and capital. However, it developed an alternative theory of value and distribution. Many of its practitioners have added various further factors of production (see below).\n\nFurther distinctions from classical and neoclassical [[microeconomics]] include the following:\n* '''[[Capital (economics)|Capital]]''' \u2014 This has many meanings, including the [[financial capital]] raised to operate and expand a business. In much of economics, however, \"capital\" (without any qualification) means goods that can help produce other goods in the future, the result of [[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]]. It refers to machines, roads, factories, schools, infrastructure, and office buildings which humans have produced to create goods and services.\n* '''[[Fixed capital]]''' \u2014 This includes machinery, factories, equipment, new technology, buildings, computers, and other goods that are designed to increase the productive potential of the economy for future years. Nowadays, many consider computer [[software]] to be a form of fixed capital and it is counted as such in the [[National Income and Product Accounts]] of the United States and other countries. This type of capital does not change due to the production of the good.\n* '''[[Working capital]]''' \u2014 This includes the stocks of finished and semi-finished goods that will be economically consumed in the near future or will be made into a finished consumer good in the near future. These are often called [[inventory]]. The phrase \"working capital\" has also been used to refer to liquid assets (money) needed for immediate expenses linked to the production process (to pay salaries, invoices, taxes, interests...) Either way, the amount or nature of this type of capital usually changes during the production process.\n* '''[[Financial capital]]''' \u2014 This is simply the amount of money the initiator of the business has invested in it. \"Financial capital\" often refers to his or her net worth tied up in the business ([[asset]]s minus [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]]) but the phrase often includes money borrowed from others.\n* '''[[Technical progress (economics)|Technological progress]]''' \u2014 For over a century, economists have known that capital and labor do not account for all economic growth. This is reflected in ''[[total factor productivity]]'' and the ''[[Solow residual]]'' used in economic models called ''[[production function]]s'' that account for the contributions of capital and labor, yet have some unexplained contributor which is commonly called ''technological progress''. [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Ayres]] and Warr (2009) present time series of the efficiency of primary energy (exergy) conversion into useful work for the US, UK, Austria and Japan revealing dramatic improvements in model accuracy. With useful work as a factor of production they are able to reproduce historical rates of economic growth with considerable precision and without recourse to exogenous and unexplained technological progress, thereby overcoming the major flaw of the Solow Theory of economic growth.<ref name=\"Ayres-Warr2009\">{{cite book| author = Robert U. Ayres|author2=Benjamin Warr| title = The Economic Growth Engine: How Energy and Work Drive Material Prosperity| year = 2009| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| isbn = 978-1-84844-182-8 }}</ref>\n\n===Ecological economics===\nEcological economics is an alternative to neoclassical economics (see: [[Neoclassical economics]]). It integrates, amongst other things, the first and second laws of thermodynamics (see: [[Laws of thermodynamics]]) to formulate more realistic economic systems that adhere to fundamental physical limitations. In addition to the neoclassical focus on efficient allocation, ecological economics emphasizes sustainability of scale and just distribution. Ecological economics also differ from neoclassical theories in its definitions of factors of production, replacing them with the following:<ref name=\"The Other Road to Serfdom\">{{cite book| author = Eric Zencey| title = The Other Road to Serfdom & the Path to Sustainable Democracy| year = 2012| publisher = U of New England| isbn = 978-1-58465-961-7 }}</ref><ref name=\" Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications\">{{cite book| author = Herman Daly|author2=Joshua Farley | title =  Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications| year = 2011| publisher = Washington: Island| isbn = 978-1-59726-681-9 }}</ref>\n\nMatter: The material from which products are produced. Matter can be recycled or reused through refining or reforming, but it cannot be created or destroyed, placing an upper limit on the amount of material that can be withdrawn and used. Consequently, the total amount of available matter is fixed, and once all the available matter is used, nothing more can be produced without recycling or reusing matter from prior products.\n\nEnergy: The physical but non-material inputs of production. We can place different forms of energy on a scale of utility depending on how useful it is for creating a product. Due to the law of entropy, energy tends to decrease in utility over time. (e.g. electricity, a very useful form of energy, is used to run a machine that builds a stuffed bear. In the process, however, electricity is converted to heat, a less useful form of energy). Like matter, energy can neither be created nor destroyed and thus there is also an upper limit to the total amount usable energy.\n\nDesign intelligence: A factor that incorporates the knowledge, creativity, and efficiency of how goods are created - the better the design, the more efficient and beneficial the creation is. Designs are usually improvements on their predecessors since our store of accumulated knowledge grows with time. One possible neoclassical analogue of design intelligence is technological progress.\n\nIntegral to ecological economics is the following notion: at the maximum rates of sustainable matter and energy uptake, the only way to increase productivity would be through an increase in design intelligence. This provides the basis for a core tenet of ecological economics, namely that infinite growth is impossible.<ref name=\"The Other Road to Serfdom\"/>\n\n== A fourth factor? ==\nAs mentioned, [[Neoclassical synthesis|recent authors]] have added to the classical list. For example, [[John Bates Clark|J. B. Clark]] saw the co-ordinating function in production and distribution as being served by [[entrepreneur]]s; [[Frank Knight]] introduced managers who co-ordinate using their own money (financial capital) and the financial capital of others. In contrast, many economists today consider \"[[human capital]]\" (skills and education) as the fourth factor of production, with entrepreneurship as a form of human capital. Yet others refer to [[intellectual capital]]. More recently, many have begun to see \"social capital\" as a factor, as contributing to production of goods and services.\n\n=== Entrepreneurship ===\nConsider entrepreneurship as a factor of production, leaving debate aside. In markets, entrepreneurs combine the other factors of production, land, labor, and capital, to make a profit. Often these entrepreneurs are seen as innovators, developing new ways to produce and new products. In a [[planned economy]], central planners decide how land, labor, and capital should be used to provide for maximum benefit for all citizens. Of course, just as with market entrepreneurs, the benefits may mostly accrue to the entrepreneurs themselves.\n\nThe sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] refers to \"new entrepreneurs\" who work within and between corporate and government bureaucracies in new and different ways.<ref>\"White Collar: The American Middle Classes,\" 1956. Oxford: Galaxy Books, pp. 94\u2013100.</ref> Others (such as those practicing [[public choice theory]]) refer to \"[[political entrepreneur]]s\", i.e., politicians and other actors.\n\nMuch controversy rages about the benefits produced by entrepreneurship. But the real issue is about how well institutions they operate in (markets, planning, bureaucracies, government) serve the public. This concerns such issues as the relative importance of [[market failure]] and [[government failure]].\n\nIn the book ''Accounting of Ideas'', \"intequity\", a [[neologism]], is abstracted from equity to add a newly researched production factor of the capitalist system. Equity, which is regarded as part of capital, was divided into equity and intequity. Entrepreneurship was divided into network-related matters and creating-related matters. Network-related matters function in the sphere of equity, and creating-related matters in spheres of intequities.<ref>Pienaar, M.D. (2014). ''Intequisms: Accounting of ideas'', chap. 6. Centurion: Africahead, 2nd edition, Kindle eBook, Amazon.com.</ref>\n\n=== Natural resources ===\nAyres and Warr (2010) are among the economists who criticize orthodox economics for overlooking the role of natural resources and the effects of declining resource capital.<ref name=\"Ayres-Warr2009\"/> See also: ''[[Natural resource economics]]''\n\n=== Energy ===\nExercise can be seen as individual factor of production, with an elastication larger than labor.<ref>R. K\u00fcmmel: [http://energiesteuer.net/artikel/pdf_artikel/portotalk.pdf The Productive Power of Energy and its Taxation], 4th European Congress Economy and Managers of Energy in Industry, Porto, Portugal, 27.-30.

H. Douglas]] disagreed with [[classical economists]] who recognized only three factors of production. While Douglas did not deny the role of these factors in production, he considered the \u201c[[Cultural heritage]]\u201d as the primary factor. He defined cultural inheritance as the knowledge, techniques, and processes that have accrued to us incrementally from the origins of civilization (i.e., [[Progress (history)|progress]]). Consequently, mankind does not have to keep \"[[reinventing the wheel]]\". \"We are merely the administrators of that cultural inheritance, and to that extent, the cultural inheritance is the property of all of us, without exception.<ref>Douglas, C.H. (22 January 1934). \"[http://www.polskawalczaca.com/library/ALOR%20-%20Monopolistic%20Idea.pdf The Monopolistic Idea]\" address at Melbourne Town Hall, Australia. The Australian League of Rights: Melbourne. Retrieved 28 February 2008.\n</ref> [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], and [[Karl Marx]] claimed that [[labour theory of value|labor creates all value]]. While Douglas did not deny that all costs ultimately relate to labour charges of some sort (past or present), he denied that the present labour of the world creates all wealth. Douglas carefully distinguished between [[value (economics)|value]], [[historical cost|costs]] and [[price]]s. He claimed that one of the factors resulting in a misdirection of thought in terms of the nature and function of money was economists' near-obsession about values and their relation to prices and incomes.<ref>\n{{cite book |title=Social Credit |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |year=1973 |publisher=Gordon Press |location=New York |pages=60 |url=http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/social_credit_by_ch_douglas.pdf |isbn=0-9501126-1-5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209091428/http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/social_credit_by_ch_douglas.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> While Douglas recognized [[use value|\"value in use\"]] as a legitimate theory of values, he also considered values as subjective and not capable of being measured in an objective manner. \n\n[[Peter Kropotkin]] argued for the common ownership of all intellectual and useful property due to the collective work that went into creating it. Kropotkin does not argue that the product of a worker's labor should belong to the worker. Instead, Kropotkin asserts that every individual product is essentially the work of everyone since every individual relies on the intellectual and physical labor of those who came before them as well as those who built the world around them. Because of this, Kropotkin proclaims that every human deserves an essential right to well-being because every human contributes to the collective social product:<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/913790063|title=The Conquest of Bread|last=Kropotkin|first=Petr Alekseevich|publisher=Penguin Classics|others=Priestland, David,|year=2015|isbn=9780141396118|edition=This edition, using the 1913 text, first published in Penguin Classics in 2015|location=London|pages=|oclc=913790063}}</ref> \nKropotkin goes on to say that the central obstacle preventing humanity from claiming this right is the state's violent protection of private property. Kropotkin compares this relationship to feudalism, saying that even if the forms have changed, the essential relationship between the propertied and the landless is the same as the relationship between a feudal lord and their serfs.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Business and economics}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Conditional factor demands]]\n* [[Cost of
