In November, at a joint hearing of Congressional Subcommittee, it was told that Grenada could be used as a staging area for subversion of the nearby countries, for intersection of shipping lanes, and for the transit of troops and supplies from Cuba to [[Africa]], and from [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Libya]] to [[Central America]]. In December, the [[State Department]] published a preliminary report on Grenada, in which was claimed as an \"Island of Soviet [[Internationalism (politics)|Internationalism]]\". When the US Marines landed on the island, they discovered a large amount of documents, which included agreements between the Soviet Government, and the New Jewel Movement, recorded minutes of the Committee meetings, and reports from the Grenadian embassy in [[Moscow]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2617710 The Soviet Union and Grenada, under the New Jewel Movement]</ref> Diplomatic relations between Grenada and the Soviet Union were severed in 1983 by the Governor General of Grenada.

These people evolved into the Chamorro people. They flourished as an advanced, horticultural and hunting society.

The matao were located in the coastal [[Villages of Guam|villages]], which meant they had the best access to fishing grounds while the mana'chang were located in the interior of the island. Matao and mana'chang rarely communicated with each other, and matao often used achaot as a go-between.\n\nThere were also \"makhanas\" (shamans) and \"suruhanus\" (herb doctors), skilled in healing and medicine.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9r0a2ww8KLcC&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Ancient Chamorro Society|last=Cunningham|first=Lawrence J.|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Bess Press|isbn=9781880188057|language=en}}</ref>Belief in spirits of ancient Chamorros called ''[[Taotao Mona]]'' still persists as remnant of pre-European society. Early European explorers noted the Chamorros' fast sailing vessels used for [[trade|trading]] with other islands of [[Micronesia]].\n\n===Latte===\nThe \"[[Latte Stones|latte stones]]\" familiar to Guam residents and visitors alike were in fact a recent development in Pre-Contact Chamorro society. The latte stone consists of a head and a base shaped out of limestone. Like the [[Easter Island]] statues, there is plenty of speculation over how this was done by a society without machines or metal, but the generally accepted view is that the head and base were etched out of the ground by sharp adzes and picks (possibly with the use of fire), and carried to the assembly area by an elaborate system of ropes and logs. The latte stone was used as a part of the raised foundation for a magalahi (matao chief) house, although they may have also been used for canoe sheds.\n\nArchaeologists using carbon-dating have broken Pre-Contact Guam (i.e. Chamorro) history into three periods: \"Pre-Latte\" (BC 2000? to AD 1) \"Transitional Pre-Latte\" (AD 1 to AD 1000), and \"Latte\" (AD 1000 to AD 1521). Archaeological evidence also suggests that Chamorro society was on the verge of another transition phase by 1521, as latte stones became bigger.\n\nAssuming the stones were used for chiefly houses, it can be argued that Chamorro society was becoming more stratified, either from population growth or the arrival of new people. The theory remains tenuous, however, due to lack of evidence, but if proven correct, will further support the idea that Pre-Contact Chamorros lived in a vibrant and dynamic environment.\n\n==Spanish era==\n\n===Magellan's first encounter with Guam===\nThe first known contact between [[Guam]] and [[Western Europe]] occurred when a Spanish expedition led by [[Ferdinand Magellan]], a Portuguese explorer sailing for the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I of Spain]], arrived with his 3-ship fleet in Guam on March 6, 1521 after a long voyage across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, from Spain. History credits the village of [[Umatac, Guam|Umatac]] as his landing place, but drawings from the navigator's diary suggest that Magellan may have landed in [[Tumon]] in northern Guam. The expedition had started out in Spain with five ships. By the time they reached the Marianas they were down to three ships and nearly half the crew, due to storms, diseases and the mutiny in one ship which destroyed the expedition.<ref name=\"Pacific Worlds\">[http://www.pacificworlds.com/guam/visitors/explore.cfm Pacific Worlds], Antonio Pigafett's accounts.</ref> Tired and hungry from their long discovery voyage, the crew prepared to go ashore and restore provisions in Guam.

After firing a few shots from the [[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'s big guns, the natives were frightened off from the ship and retreated into the surrounding jungle. Magellan was eventually able to obtain rations and offered iron, a highly prized material, in exchange for fresh fruits, vegetables, and water. Details of this visit, the first in history between Westerners and a Pacific island people, come from the journal of [[Antonio Pigafetta]], the expedition's scribe and one of only 18 crew members to eventually survive the [[circumnavigation]] of the globe, completed by [[Juan Sebastian Elcano]].<ref name=\"Pacific Worlds\" />\n\n===Spanish colonization===\nDespite Magellan's visit, Guam was not officially claimed by Spain until 1565 by [[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi]].

Once Christianity was established, the Catholic Church became the focal point for village activities, as in other Spanish cities.

Quipuha welcomed the missionaries and consented to be baptized by San Vitores as Juan Quipuha. Quipuha granted the lands on which the first Catholic Church in Guam, the Dulce Nombre de Maria {Sweet Name of Mary} Cathedral Basilica, was constructed in 1669. The original cathedral was destroyed during [[World War II]] and the present Cathedral, was constructed on the original site in 1955. Chief Quipuha died in 1669 but his policy of allowing the Spanish to establish a base on Guam had important consequences for the future of the island. It also facilitated the Manila [[Galleon trade]].\n\nA few years later, Jesuit priest [[Diego Luis de San Vitores]] and his assistant, [[Pedro Calungsod]] were brutally killed by Chief Mata'pang of Tomhom (Tumon) allegedly for baptizing the Chief's baby girl without the Chief's consent. This was April 1672. Many Chamorros at the time believed baptisms killed babies  - because priests would baptize infants already near death (in the belief that this was the only way to save such children's souls), baptism seemed to many Chamorros to be the cause of death.{{r|Rodgers}}{{rp|49}} San Vitores carried out his mission in a peaceful manner, preaching Christianity and moral values to the indigenous population. So when San Vitores was assassinated by Mata'pang, the Spanish forces attempted to capture the guilty. This led to a number of battles in which many Spanish and Chamorros died. Mata'pang himself was killed in a final battle on the Island of Rota in 1680.<ref name=\"Guam Online\" />\n\nDuring the course of the Spanish administration of Guam, lower birth rates and diseases reduced the population from 12,000{{r|Rodgers}}{{rp|47}} to roughly 5,000 by 1741{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. After 1695, Chamorros settled in five villages: [[Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a]], [[Agat, Guam|Agat]], [[Umatac]], [[Chalan Pago-Ordot, Guam|Pago]], and [[Fena, Guam|Fena]]. During this historical period, Spanish language and customs were introduced in the island and [[Catholicism]] became the predominant religion. The Spanish built infrastructures such as roads and ports, as well as schools and hospitals. Spanish and Filipinos, mostly men, increasingly intermarried with the Chamorros, particularly the new cultured or \"high\" people (''manak'kilo'') or gentry of the towns. In 1740, Chamorros of the Northern Mariana Islands, except [[Rota (island)|Rota]], were moved from some of their home islands to Guam. Documents from the Spanish period are the only historical sources about colonial and pre-colonial times in the island. As in the Philippines, Spanish scholars wrote about Chamorro culture and language, including dictionaries and anthropological reports which are of great historical value today.\n \nThe Galleon Era ended in 1815 following the [[Mexican Independence]]. Guam later was host to a number of scientists, voyagers, and whalers from Russia, France, and England who also provided detailed accounts of the daily life on Guam under Spanish rule. Through the Spanish colonial period, Guam inherited food, language, and surnames from Spain and [[Spanish America]].<ref name=\"Ms.G\">[Christina Gumatatotato Lecture], World History and Geography.</ref>\n\n==American era==\n\n===Capture of Guam===\n[[File:Piti 1900.jpg|middle|thumb|350px|The [[Villages of Guam|village]] of [[Piti, Guam|Piti]] shortly after Guam's capture by the Americans.\n]]\n[[File:Naval Governor of Guam, attends Arbor Day exercises at the Governor's Palace, c 1930.jpg|thumb|290px|Commander [[Willis W.

The Japanese immediately renamed the island \"Omiya Jima\" (Great Shrine Island).<ref>http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/extcontent/wapa/guides/first/sec4.htm,retrieved 29 December 2009</ref>\n\nThe Japanese military occupation of Guam lasted from 1941 to 1944.<ref>Wakako Higuchi, ''The Japanese Administration of Guam, 1941-1944: A Study of Occupation and Integration Policies, with Japanese Oral Histories'' (Jefferson  McFarland, 2013); [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=38466  online review]</ref> It was a coercive experience for the Chamorro people, whose loyalty to the United States became a point of contention with the Japanese. Several American servicemen remained on the island, however, and were hidden by the Chamorro people. All of these servicemen were found and executed by Japanese forces in 1942; only one escaped.\n\nThe second [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Battle of Guam]] began on July 21, 1944 with American troops landing on western side of the island after several weeks of pre-invasion bombardment by the U.S. Navy. After several weeks of heavy fighting, Japanese forces officially surrendered on August 10, 1944.\n\nGuam was subsequently converted into a forward operations base for the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Airfields were constructed in the northern part of the island (including [[Andersen Air Force Base]]), the island's pre-WWII [[Naval Base Guam|Naval Station]] was expanded, and numerous facilities and supply depots were constructed throughout the island.\n\nGuam's two largest pre-war communities (Sumay and [[Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a]]) were virtually destroyed during the 1944 battle. Many Chamorro families lived in temporary re-settlement camps near the beaches before moving to permanent homes constructed in the island's outer villages. Guam's southern villages largely escaped damage, however.\n\n===Self-determination===\nThe immediate years after [[World War II]] saw the [[United States armed forces|U.S. Navy]] attempting to resume its predominance in Guam affairs. This eventually led to resentment, and thus increased political pressure from Chamorro leaders for greater autonomy.\n\nThe result was the [[Guam Organic Act of 1950]] which established Guam as an unincorporated [[organized territory]] of the United States and, for the first time in Guam history, provided for a civilian government.\n\nThe [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]], section 307, granted [[U.S. citizenship]] to \"all persons born in the island of Guam on or after April 11, 1899. In the 1960s, the island's required [[security clearance]] for visitors was lifted.\n\nOn September 11, 1968, eighteen years after passage of the Organic Act, Congress passed the \"[[Elective Governor Acts of 1968|Elective Governor Act]]\" (Public Law 90-497), which allowed the people of Guam to elect their own governor and lieutenant governor. Nearly four years later, Congress passed the \"Guam-Virgin Islands Delegate\" Act that allowed for one Guam delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives. The delegate has a voice in debates and a vote in committees, but no vote on the floor of the House.\n\nAlthough Public Law 94-584 established the formation of a \"locally drafted\" constitution (later known as the \"Guam Constitution\"), the proposed document was rejected by Guam residents in an [[Guamanian constitutional referendum, 1979|August 4, 1979 referendum]].\n\nIn the meantime, Guam's local government had formed several political status commissions to address possible options for self-determination. The following year after passage of the Guam Delegate Act saw the creation of the \"Status Commission\" by the Twelfth Guam Legislature.\n\nThis was followed by the establishment of the \"Second Political Status Commission\" in 1975 and the Guam \"Commission on Self-Determination\" (CSD) in 1980. The Twenty-Fourth Guam Legislature established the \"Commission on Decolonization\" in 1996 to enhance CSD's ongoing studies of various political status options and public education campaigns.\n\nThese efforts enabled the CSD, barely two years after its creation, to organize a [[Guamanian status referendum, January 1982|status referendum]] on January 12, 1982. 49% of voters chose a closer relationship with the United States via [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]].\n\nTwenty-six percent voted for Statehood, while ten percent voted for the Status Quo (as an Unincorporated territory). A [[Guamanian status referendum, September 1982|subsequent run-off referendum]] held between Commonwealth and Statehood saw 73% of Guam voters choosing Commonwealth over Statehood (27%). Today, Guam remains an unincorporated territory despite referendums and a United Nations mandate to establish a permanent status for the island.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Contemporary Guam===\n[[File:Apra Harbor.jpg|left|thumb|290px|Guam contains several [[military base]]s including the [[U.S. Navy|United States Naval]] Station on the [[Point Udall (Guam)|Orote]] Peninsula shown here.]]\n\nGuam's [[U.S. military]] installations remain among the most strategically vital in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. When the [[United States]] closed its [[United States Navy|Naval]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] bases in the [[Philippines]] after the expiration of their leases in the early 1990s, many of the forces stationed there were relocated to Guam.\n\nThe removal of Guam's security clearance by President John F. Kennedy in 1963 allowed for the development of a [[tourism]] industry. The island's rapid economic development was fueled both by rapid growth in this industry as well as increased U.S. Federal Government spending during the 1980s and 1990s.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=July 2012}}\n\nOn August 6, 1997, [[Korean Air Flight 801]], a Boeing 747-300 bound for Guam crashed into Nimitz Hill while on final approach to the airport, killing 228 of the 254 people on board.\n{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe [[Asian financial crisis|Asian economic crisis]] of the late 1990s, which hit Japan particularly hard, severely affected Guam's tourism industry. Military cutbacks in the 1990s also disrupted the island's economy. Economic recovery was further hampered by devastation from Supertyphoons [[Typhoon Paka|Paka]] in 1997 and [[Typhoon Pongsona|Pongsona]] in 2002, as well as the effects of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] on tourism.\n\nThere are signs that Guam is recovering from these setbacks. The increased arrivals of Japanese tourists reflect that country's economic recovery, as well as Guam's enduring appeal as a weekend tropical retreat. U.S. military spending has dramatically increased as part of the [[War on Terrorism]].\n\nRecent proposals to strengthen U.S. military facilities, including negotiations to transfer 8,000 [[U.S. Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] from [[Okinawa]], also indicate renewed interest in Guam by the U.S. military. American forces were originally scheduled to relocate from Okinawa to Guam beginning in 2012 or 2013. However, that has been set back due to budget constrains and local resistance to the additional military presence.\n\n\"Cosmopolitan\" Guam poses particular challenges for Chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity in the face of [[acculturation]]. The increasing numbers of Chamorros, especially Chamorro youth, relocating to the U.S. Mainland has further complicated both definition and preservation of Chamorro identity.\n\n==See also==\n{{Main article|Historical outline of Guam}}\n\n* [[Guam]]\n* [[Villages of Guam]]\n* [[San Vitores]]\n* [[Chief Kepuha]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Robert F.

Guam is an [[Government of Guam|organized, unincorporated territory]] of the [[United States]] with policy relations between Guam and the US under the jurisdiction of the [[Office of Insular Affairs]].\n\n==Background==\nThe economy of Guam is greatly dependent on the U.S. military bases there. The U.S. connection also contributes to Guam's status as a Japanese tourist destination.  Some assume the Guamanian population is sympathetic toward the United States, based on common tribulations during [[World War II]], and on relations with the U.S. military since.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} \n\nHowever, maintenance of the status quo vis-\u00e0-vis the current political relationship between the territory and the United States is not without controversy. There is a significant movement in favor of the Territory becoming a [[commonwealth (United States insular area)|commonwealth]], which would give it a political status similar to [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]].  Competing movements exist, which advocate political independence from the United States, statehood, or a combination with the Northern Mariana Islands as a single territory (not necessarily commonwealth). These proposals, however, are not seen as favorable by the U.S. federal government, which argues Guam does not have the financial stability or self-sufficiency to warrant such status. They cite Guam\u2019s increasing reliance on Federal spending as evidence, and question how commonwealth status or statehood would benefit the United States as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} \n\nA portion of the people on Guam favor a modified version of the current Territorial status, involving greater autonomy from the federal government (similar to the autonomy of individual States).  Perceived indifference by the U.S. Congress regarding a change-of-status petition submitted by Guam has led many to feel that the territory is being deprived of the benefits of a more equitable union with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

Before Guam's inclusion, calling the U.S. required dialing the international 011 first, thus resulting in higher long distance rates and less frequent calls to the U.S. by relatives in Guam. Prices of long distance calls to these destinations have dropped significantly to the point where now calling the U.S. from Guam or calling Guam from the U.S. costs the same. \n\n== Mail == \nSome companies in the U.S. mainland still treat Guam as a foreign country and refuse to sell and ship items to Guam.

The modern history of [[Guatemala]] began with the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]] in 1511.\n\nMost of the great Classic-era (250 \u2013 900&nbsp;AD) Maya cities of the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin]] region, in the northern lowlands of Guatemala, had been abandoned by the year 1000&nbsp;AD. The states in the Belize central highlands flourished until the arrival in 1525 of [[Pedro de Alvarado]], the Spanish [[Conquistador]]. Called \"the invader\" by the Maya peoples, he began subjugating the Indian states forces.\n\nGuatemala was part of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], for nearly 330 years; this Captaincy, or ''Capitan\u00eda'', included the territories comprosing modern [[Mexico]], and the modern countries of [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]]. The ''Capitania'' became independent in 1821, and became a part of the [[First Mexican Empire]] until 1823. From 1824 it was a part of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], until the Republic dissolved in 1841, when Guatemala became fully independent. In the late 20 century, Guatemala experienced a series of authoritarian governments.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Guatemala's potential for agricultural exploitation attracted several foreign companies to it, the most prominent being the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFC). These companies, supported by the country's authoritarian rulers, and the [[United States]] government through their support for brutal labor regulations and massive concessions to wealthy landowners. In 1944, the policies of [[Jorge Ubico]] led to a popular uprising which began the ten-year [[Guatemalan Revolution]]. The presidencies of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo]] and [[Jacobo \u00c1rbenz]] saw sweeping social and economic reforms, including a significant increase in literacy and a successful [[Decree 900|agrarian reform program]].\n\nThe progressive policies of Ar\u00e9valo and \u00c1rbenz led to the United Fruit Company lobbying the United States government for their overthrow, and a [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat|US-engineered coup]] in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a military regime in its place. This was soon followed by other military governments, and jolted off a [[Guatemalan Civil War|civil war]] between the government and guerrillas that lasted from 1960 to 1996. The war saw [[human rights violations]], including a [[genocide]] of the indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya population]] by the United States-backed military. Following the end of the war in 1997, Guatemala re-established a [[representative democracy]]. It has since struggled to enforce the rule of law and suffers a high crime rate, as well as continued extrajudicial killings, often executed by security forces.\n\n==Pre-Columbian era==\n{{main|Maya civilization}}\n[[Image:Nakbe str.JPG|right|250px|thumb| The remains of the ''Nakb\u00e9'' palace from the mid pre-Classic period, Mirador Basin, Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala.]]\nThe earliest human settlements in Guatemala date back to the [[Paleo-Indian]] period and were made up of hunters and gatherers.<ref name=\"Guatemala, 1999\">''Historia General de Guatemala,'' 1999.</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}Sites dating back to 6500 [[Before Christ|BC]] have been found in [[Quich\u00e9 department|Quich\u00e9]] in the Highlands and [[Sipacate]], [[Escuintla]] on the central Pacific coast.\n\nAlthough it is unclear when these groups of hunters and gatherers turned to cultivation, pollen samples from [[Pet\u00e9n (department)|Pet\u00e9n]] and the Pacific coast indicate maize cultivation as early as 3500&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ess.geology.ufl.edu/hodell/ICDP/Leyden.pdf |publisher=University of Florida |title=Pollen Evidence for Climatic Variability and Cultural Disturbance in the Maya Lowlands |first=Barbara |last=Leyden |accessdate= |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206082017/http://ess.geology.ufl.edu/hodell/ICDP/Leyden.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2009 |df= }}</ref> By 2500&nbsp;BC, small settlements were developing in Guatemala's Pacific lowlands in such places as Tilapa, [[La Blanca]], Oc\u00f3s, El Mesak, and [[Ujuxte]], where the oldest pieces of ceramic pottery from Guatemala have been found.<ref name=\"Guatemala, 1999\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}} Excavations in the [[Antigua Guatemala]] Ur\u00edas and Rucal, have yielded stratified materials from the Early and Middle Preclassic periods (2000&nbsp;BC to 400&nbsp;BC).

Many sites of this era display monumental masks for the first time ([[Uaxact\u00fan]], El Mirador, [[Cival]], Tikal and Nakb\u00e9). Hansen's dating has been called into question by many other Maya archaeologists, and developments leading to probably extra-regional power by the Late Preclassic of Kaminaljuyu, in the Southern Maya Area, suggest that Maya civilization developed in different ways in the Lowlands and the SMA to produce what we know as the Classic Maya.\n\nThe Classic period of Mesoamerican civilization corresponds to the height of the Maya civilization, and is represented by countless sites throughout Guatemala. The largest concentration is found in Pet\u00e9n.

When they met, Zavala not only did not capture him, but agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City that they would have to negotiate with Carrera or battle on two fronts \u2013 Quetzaltenango and Jalapa.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=278}}  Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in [[Suchitep\u00e9quez]] as a tactical maneuver.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=}} Carrera received a visit from a Cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he would keep them appeased.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=278}} When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=279}}\n\nGuzm\u00e1n went to [[Antigua Guatemala]] to meet with another group of Paredes emissaries; they agreed that Los Altos would rejoin Guatemala, and that the latter would help Guzm\u00e1n defeat his hated enemy and also build a port on the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=279}} Guzm\u00e1n was sure of victory this time, but his plan evaporated when, in his absence, Carrera and his native allies had occupied Quetzaltenango; Carrera appointed Ignacio Yrigoyen as Corregidor and convinced him that he should work with the k'iche', mam, q'anjobal and mam leaders to keep the region under control.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=280}}  On his way out, Yrigoyen murmured to a friend: Now he is the King of the Indians, indeed!{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=280}}\n\nGuzm\u00e1n then left for Jalapa, where he struck a deal with the rebels, while [[Luis Batres Juarros]] convinced President Paredes to deal with Carrera.

After discovering the value of the plant, the wealthier Yucateco criollos started plantations, beginning in 1833, to cultivate it on a large scale; not long after the henequen boom, a boom in sugar production led to more wealth. The sugar and henequen plantations encroached on native communal land, and native workers recruited to work on the plantations were mistreated and underpaid.{{sfn|Rugely|1996|p=}}\n\nHowever, rebel leaders in their correspondence with British Honduras -Belize- were more often inclined to cite taxation as the immediate cause of the war; Jacinto Pat, for example, wrote in 1848 that \"what we want is liberty and not oppression, because before we were subjugated with the many contributions and taxes that they imposed on us.\"{{sfn|Rugely|2001|p=51}} Pac's companion, Cecilio Chi added in 1849, that promises made by the rebel Santiago Im\u00e1n, that he was \"liberating the Indians from the payment of contributions\" as a reason for resisting the central government, but in fact he continued levying them.{{Sfn|Rugely|2001|p=53-4}}\n\nIn June 1847, M\u00e9ndez learned that a large force of armed natives and supplies had gathered at the Culumpich, a property owned by Jacinto Pat, the Maya ''batab'' (leader), near Valladolid. Fearing revolt, Mendez arrested [[Manuel Antonio Ay]], the principal Maya leader of Chichimil\u00e1, accused of planning a revolt, and executed him at the town square of Valladolid. Furthermore, M\u00e9ndez searching for other insurgents burned the town of Tepich and repressed its residents. In the following months, several Maya towns were sacked and many people arbitrarily killed. In his letter of 1849, Cecilio Chi noted that Santiago Mendez had come to \"put every Indian, big and little, to death\" but that the Maya had responded to some degree, in kind, writing \"it has pleased God and good fortune that a much greater portion of them [whites] than of the Indians [have died].{{sfn|Rugeley|2001|p=54}}\n\nCecilio Chi, the native leader of Tepich, along with Jacinto Pat attacked Tepich on 30 July 1847, in reaction to the indiscriminate massacre of Mayas, ordered that all the non-Maya population be killed. By spring of 1848, the Maya forces had taken over most of the Yucat\u00e1n, with the exception of the walled cities of [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche]] and [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n|M\u00e9rida]] and the south-west coast, with Yucatecan troops holding the road from M\u00e9rida to the port of [[Sisal, Yucat\u00e1n|Sisal]]. The Yucatecan governor [[Miguel Barbachano]] had prepared a decree for the evacuation of M\u00e9rida, but was apparently delayed in publishing it by the lack of suitable paper in the besieged capital. The decree became unnecessary when the republican troops suddenly broke the siege and took the offensive with major advances.{{sfn|Rugeley|2001|p=58}}\n\nGovernor Barbachano sought allies anywhere he could find them, in Cuba (for Spain), Jamaica (for the United Kingdom) and the United States, but none of these foreign powers would intervene, although the matter was taken seriously enough in the United States to be debated in Congress. Subsequently, therefore, he turned to Mexico, and accepted a return to Mexican authority. Yucat\u00e1n was officially reunited with Mexico on 17 August 1848. Yucateco forces rallied, aided by fresh guns, money, and troops from Mexico, and pushed back the natives from more than half of the state.{{sfn|Rugeley|2001|p=59}}\n\nBy 1850 the nativesoccupied two distinct regions in the southeast and they were inspired to continue the struggle by the apparition of the \"Talking Cross\". This apparition, believed to be a way in which God communicated with the Maya, dictated that the War continue. Chan Santa Cruz, or Small Holy Cross became the religious and political center of the Maya resistance and the rebellion came to be infused with religious significance. Chan Santa Cruz also became the name of the largest of the independent Maya states, as well as the name of the capital city which is now the city of [[Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo]]. The followers of the Cross were known as the \"Cruzob\".\n\nThe government of Yucat\u00e1n first declared the war over in 1855, but hopes for peace were premature. There were regular skirmishes, and occasional deadly major assaults into each other's territory, by both sides. The [[United Kingdom]] recognized the Chan Santa Cruz Maya as a \"de facto\" independent nation, in part because of the major trade between Chan Santa Cruz and [[British Honduras]].\n\n=== Battle of La Arada ===\n{{Main|Battle of La Arada}}\n{{See also|Doroteo Vasconcelos|Vicente Cerna y Cerna}}\n\nAfter Carrera returned from exile in 1849, Vasconcelos granted asylum to the Guatemalan liberals, who harassed the Guatemalan government in several different forms: Jos\u00e9 Francisco Barrundia did it through a liberal newspaper established with that specific goal; Vasconcelos gave support during a whole year to a rebel faction \"La Monta\u00f1a\", in eastern Guatemala, providing and distributing money and weapons. By late 1850, Vasconcelos was getting impatient at the slow progress of the war with Guatemala and decided to plan an open attack. Under that circumstance, the Salvadorean head of state started a campaign against the conservative Guatemalan regime, inviting [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]] to participate in the alliance; only the [[Honduras|Honduran]] government led by [[Juan Lindo]] accepted.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1930|p=}}\n\nMeanwhile, in Guatemala, where the invasion plans were perfectly well known, President [[Mariano Paredes (Guatemala)|Mariano Paredes]] started taking precautions to face the situation, while the Guatemalan Archbishop, [[Francisco de Paula Garc\u00eda Pel\u00e1ez]], ordered peace prayers in the archdiocese.<ref group=lower-alpha>{{cite book|author=Woodward|year=1993|title=Rafael Carrera and the Emergence of the Republic of Guatemala|quote=In the Conservative regime of Guatemala, the Catholic Church was entangled with the Government and the leaders of both were relatives, mostly of the Aycinena family.}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 January 1851, [[Doroteo Vasconcelos]] and Juan Lindo met in [[Ocotepeque]], Honduras, where they signed an alliance against Guatemala. The Salvadorean army had 4,000 men, properly trained and armed and supported by artillery; the Honduran army numbered 2,000 men. The coalition army was stationed in [[Metap\u00e1n]], El Salvador, due to its proximity with both the Guatemalan and Honduran borders.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1930|p=}}{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|pp=316\u2013317}}\n\nOn 28 January 1851, Vasconcelos sent a letter to the Guatemalan Ministry of Foreign Relations, in which he demanded that the Guatemalan president relinquish power, so that the alliance could designate a new head of state loyal to the liberals and that Carrera be exiled, escorted to any of the Guatemalan southern ports by a Salvadorean regiment.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=315}} The Guatemalan government did not accept the terms and the Allied army entered Guatemalan territory at three different places. On 29 January, a 500-man contingent entered through Pi\u00f1uelas, [[Agua Blanca, Jutiapa|Agua Blanca]] and [[Jutiapa]], led by General Vicente Baquero, but the majority of the invading force marched from Metap\u00e1n. The Allied army was composed of 4,500 men led by Vasconcelos, as Commander in Chief. Other commanders were the generals [[Jos\u00e9 Santos Guardiola]], [[Ram\u00f3n Belloso]], [[Jos\u00e9 Trinidad Caba\u00f1as]] and [[Gerardo Barrios]]. Guatemala was able to recruit 2,000 men, led by Lieutenant General Carrera as Commander in Chief, with several colonels.\n\nCarrera's strategy was to feign a retreat, forcing the enemy forces to follow the \"retreating\" troops to a place he had previously chosen; on 1 February 1851, both armies were facing each other with only the San Jos\u00e9 river between them. Carrera had fortified the foothills of La Arada, its summit about {{Convert|50|m|ft}} above the level of the river. A meadow {{Convert|300|m|ft}} deep lay between the hill and the river, and boarding the meadow was a sugar cane plantation. Carrera divided his army in three sections: the left wing was led by Cerna and Solares; the right wing led by Bola\u00f1os. He personally led the central battalion, where he placed his artillery. Five hundred men stayed in [[Chiquimula]] to defend the city and to aid in a possible retreat, leaving only 1,500 Guatemalans against an enemy of 4,500.\n\nThe battle began at 8:30&nbsp;AM, when Allied troops initiated an attack at three different points, with an intense fire opened by both armies. The first Allied attack was repelled by the defenders of the foothill; during the second attack, the Allied troops were able to take the first line of trenches. They were subsequently expelled. During the third attack, the Allied force advanced to a point where it was impossible to distinguish between Guatemalan and Allied troops. Then, the fight became a mel\u00e9e, while the Guatemalan artillery severely punished the invaders. At the height of the battle when the Guatemalans faced an uncertain fate, Carrera ordered that sugar cane plantation around the meadow to be set on fire. The invading army was now surrounded: to the front, they faced the furious Guatemalan firepower, to the flanks, a huge blaze and to the rear, the river, all of which made retreat very difficult. The central division of the Allied force panicked and started a disorderly retreat. Soon, all of the Allied troops started retreating.\n\nThe 500 men of the rearguard pursued what was left of the Allied army, which desperately fled for the borders of their respective countries. The final count of the Allied losses were 528 dead, 200 prisoners, 1,000 rifles, 13,000 rounds of ammunition, many pack animals and baggage, 11 drums and seven artillery pieces. Vasconcelos sought refuge in [[El Salvador]], while two Generals mounted on the same horse were seen crossing the Honduran border. Carrera regrouped his army and crossed the Salvadorean border, occupying [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]], before he received orders from the Guatemalan President, Mariano Paredes, to return to Guatemala, since the Allies were requesting a cease-fire and a peace treaty.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|pp=311\u2013328}}\n\n==== Concordat of 1854 ====\n{{Main|Concordat of 1854}}\n\n{{Infobox document\n|document_name        = Concordat between the Holy See and the President of the Republic of Guatemala\n|date_created         = 1852\n|date_ratified        = 1854\n|location_of_document = {{flag|Vatican}} and [[Congress of Guatemala]]\n|writer               = Fernando Lorenzana and [[Juan Jos\u00e9 de Aycinena y Pi\u00f1ol]]\n|signatories          =* Secretary of State of the Vatican: Cardinal Antonelli\n* [[President of Guatemala]] Rafael Carrera\n* Minister of Interior, Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs of Guatemala: [[Pedro de Aycinena]]\n| purpose = Through this treaty, Guatemala gave the education of the Guatemalan people to the regular orders of the [[Catholic Church]], committed to respect the ecclesiastical properties and monasteries, authorized mandatory tithing and allowed the bishops to censor what was published in the country.{{sfn | Aycinena | 1854 | p = 2-16}}\n}}\n\nThe Concordat of 1854 was an international treaty between Carrera and the [[Holy See]], signed in 1852 and ratified by both parties in 1854. Through this, Guatemala gave the education of Guatemalan people to regular orders of the Catholic Church, committed to respect ecclesiastical property and monasteries, imposed mandatory tithing and allowed the bishops to censor what was published in the country; in return, Guatemala received dispensations for the members of the army, allowed those who had acquired the properties that the liberals had expropriated from the Church in 1829 to keep those properties, received the taxes generated by the properties of the Church, and had the right to judge certain crimes committed by clergy under Guatemalan law.{{sfn | Aycinena | 1854 | p = 2-16}} The concordat was designed by Juan Jos\u00e9 de Aycinena y Pi\u00f1ol and not only reestablished but reinforced the relationship between Church and State in Guatemala. It was in force until the fall of the conservative government of Field Marshal [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]].\n\nIn 1854, by initiative of [[Manuel Francisco Pav\u00f3n Aycinena]], Carrera was declared \"supreme and perpetual leader of the nation\" for life, with the power to choose his successor. He was in that position until he died on 14 April 1865. While he pursued some measures to set up a foundation for economic prosperity to please the conservative landowners, military challenges at home and in a three-year war with [[Honduras]], El Salvador, and [[Nicaragua]] dominated his presidency. His rivalry with [[Gerardo Barrios]], President of El Salvador, resulted in open war in 1863.\n\nAt [[Coatepeque, Quetzaltenango|Coatepeque]] the Guatemalans suffered a severe defeat, which was followed by a truce. Honduras joined with El Salvador, and Nicaragua and [[Costa Rica]] with Guatemala. The contest was finally settled in favor of Carrera, who besieged and occupied San Salvador, and dominated Honduras and Nicaragua. He continued to act in concert with the Clerical Party, and tried to maintain friendly relations with the European governments. Before his death, Carrera nominated his friend and loyal soldier, Army Marshall Vicente Cerna y Cerna, as his successor.\n\n==== Wyke-Aycinena treaty: Limits convention about Belize ====\n\n[[File:Segundoescudoguate 2014-06-22 09-16.jpg|thumb|200px|Coat of Arms of the Republic of Guatemala between 1858 and 1871.

In 1859, William Walker's threat loomed again over Central America; in order to get the weapons needed to face the filibuster, Carrera's regime had to come to terms about Belize with the British Empire. On 30 April 1859, the Wyke-Aycinena treaty was signed, between the English and Guatemalan representatives.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|30 abril 1959|p=}}  The controversial Wyke-Aycinena from 1859 had two parts:\n\n* The first six articles clearly defined the Guatemala-Belize border: Guatemala acknowledged England sovereignty over the Belize territory.{{sfn|Woodward|1993|p=309}}\n* The seventh article was about the construction of a road between Belize City and Guatemala City, which would be of mutual benefic, as Belize needed a way to communicate with the Pacific coast of Guatemala, having lost its commercial relevance after the construction of the transoceanic railroad in Panama in 1855; on the other hand, Guatemala needed a road to improve communication with its Atlantic coast. However, the road was never built; first because Guatemalan and Belizeans could not reach an agreement of the exact location for the road, and later because the conservatives lost power in Guatemala in 1871, and the liberal government declared the treaty void.{{sfn|Woodward|1993|p=310}}\n\nAmong those who signed the treaty was [[Jos\u00e9 Milla y Vidaurre]], who worked with Aycinena in the Foreign Ministry at the time.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1930|p=}} Rafael Carrera ratified the treaty on 1 May 1859, while  Charles Lennox Wyke, British consul in Guatemala, travelled to Great Britain and got the royal approval on 26 September 1859.{{sfn|Woodward|1993|p=310}}  there were some protests coming from the American consul, Beverly Clarke, and some liberal representatives, but the issue was settled.{{sfn|Woodward|1993|p=310}} As of 1850, it was estimated that Guatemala had a population of 600,000.{{sfn|Baily|1850|p=55}}{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=152\u2013160}}\n\nGuatemala's \"Liberal Revolution\" came in 1871 under the leadership of [[Justo Rufino Barrios]], who worked to modernize the country, improve trade, and introduce new crops and manufacturing. During this era coffee became an important crop for Guatemala.{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=173\u2013175}} Barrios had ambitions of reuniting Central America and took the country to war in an unsuccessful attempt to attain it, losing his life on the battlefield in 1885 against forces in El Salvador.\n\n=== Justo Rufino Barrios government ===\n{{Main|Justo Rufino Barrios}}\n\n[[File:Penitenciaria1892.jpg|200px|thumb|Guatemalan National Penitentiary, built by Barrios to incarcerate and torture his political enemies.]]\n\nThe Conservative government in [[Honduras]] gave military backing to a group of Guatemalan Conservatives wishing to take back the government, so Barrios declared war on the Honduran government.

Without this document, any day laborer was at the mercy of the local authorities and the landlords.''{{sfn|Mart\u00ednez Pel\u00e1ez|1990|p=854}}\n\nIn 1879, a constitution was ratified for Guatemala (the Republic's first as an independent nation, as the old Conservador regime had ruled by decree). In 1880, Barrios was reelected President for a six-year term.

The congress president was scared of this, and declared Barillas interim president on the spot.

The dictators that ruled Guatemala during the late 19th and early 20th century were generally very accommodating to U.S. business and political interests; thus, unlike other Latin American nations such as Haiti, Nicaragua and Cuba the U.S. did not have to use overt military force to maintain dominance in Guatemala. The Guatemalan military/police worked closely with the [[U.S. military]] and [[U.S. State Department|State Department]] to secure U.S. interests. The Guatemalan government exempted several U.S. corporations from paying taxes, especially the [[United Fruit Company]], privatized and sold off publicly owned utilities, and gave away huge swaths of public land.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=8\u201310}}\n\n=== Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime (1898\u20131920)===\n{{Main|Manuel Estrada Cabrera}}\n\n[[File:Manuel Estrada Cabrera.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] ruled Guatemala between 1898 and 1920.]]\n\nAfter the assassination of general [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reina Barrios]] on 8 February 1898, the Guatemalan cabinet called an emergency meeting to appoint a new successor, but declined to invite Estrada Cabrera to the meeting, even though he was the First Designated to the Presidency. There are two versions on how he was able to get the Presidency: (a) Estrada Cabrera entered \"with pistol drawn\" to assert his entitlement to the presidency {{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=54}} and (b) Estrada Cabrera showed up unarmed to the meeting and demanded to be given the presidency as he was the First Designated\".{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=42}}\n\nThe first Guatemalan head of state taken from civilian life in over 50 years, Estrada Cabrera overcame resistance to his regime by August 1898 and called for September elections, which he won handily.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=46}} At that time, Estrada Cabrera was 44 years old; he was stocky, of medium height, dark, and broad-shouldered. The mustache gave him plebeian appearance. Black and dark eyes, metallic sounding voice and was rather sullen and brooding. At the same time, he already showed his courage and character. This was demonstrated on the night of the death of Reina Barrios when he stood in front of the ministers, meeting in the Government Palace to choose a successor, ''Gentlemen, let me please sign this decree. As First Designated, you must hand me the Presidency''. \"His first decree was a general amnesty and the second was to reopen all the elementary schools closed by Reyna Barrios, both administrative and political measures aimed to gain the public opinion. Estrada Cabrera was almost unknown in the political circles of the capital and one could not foresee the features of his government or his intentions.{{sfn|Montenegro|2005|p=}}\n\nIn 1898, the Legislature convened for the election of President Estrada Cabrera, who triumphed thanks to the large number of soldiers and policemen who went to vote in civilian clothes and to the large number of illiterate family that they brought with them to the polls. Also, the effective propaganda that was written in the official newspaper \"the Liberal Idea '. The latter was run by the poet Joaquin Mendez, and among the drafters were [[Enrique G\u00f3mez Carrillo]], -a famous writer who had just returned to Guatemala from [[Paris]], and who had confidence that Estrada Cabrera was the president that Guatemala needed- [[Rafael Spinola]], [[M\u00e1ximo Soto Hall]] and Juan Manuel Mendoza -who later would be G\u00f3mez Carrillo biographer- and others. G\u00f3mez Carrillo received as a reward for his work as political propagandist the appointment as General Consul in Paris, with 250 gold pesos monthly salary and immediately went back to Europe {{sfn|Torres Espinoza|2007|p=42}}\n\nOne of Estrada Cabrera's most famous and most bitter legacies was allowing the entry of the [[United Fruit Company]] into the Guatemalan economical and political arena. As a member of the [[Liberalism in Latin America|Liberal Party]], he sought to encourage development of the nation's infrastructure of highways, railroads, and [[sea port]]s for the sake of expanding the export economy. By the time Estrada Cabrera assumed the presidency, there had been repeated efforts to construct a railroad from the major port of [[Puerto Barrios]] to the capital, Guatemala City. Yet due to lack of funding exacerbated by the collapse of the internal coffee trade, the railway fell sixty miles short of its goal. Estrada Cabrera decided, without consulting the legislature or judiciary, that striking a deal with the United Fruit Company was the only way to get finish the railway.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=}} Cabrera signed a contract with UFCO's [[Minor Cooper Keith]] in 1904 that gave the company tax-exemptions, land grants, and control of all railroads on the Atlantic side.{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=}}\n\nEstrada Cabrera often employed brutal methods to assert his authority, as that was the school of government in Guatemala at the time. Like him, presidents [[Rafael Carrera]] y Turcios and [[Justo Rufino Barrios]] had led tyrannical governments in the country. Right at the beginning of his first presidential period, he started prosecuting his political rivals and soon established a well-organized web of spies. One American Ambassador returned to the United States after he learned the dictator had given orders to poison him. Former President [[Manuel Barillas]] was stabbed to death in Mexico City, on a street outside of the Mexican Presidential Residence on Cabrera's orders; the street now bears the name of Calle Guatemala. Also, Estrada Cabrera responded violently to workers' strikes against UFCO. In one incident, when UFCO went directly to Estrada Cabrera to resolve a strike (after the armed forces refused to respond), the president ordered an armed unit to enter the workers' compound. The forces \"arrived in the night, firing indiscriminately into the workers' sleeping quarters, wounding and killing an unspecified number.\"{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=83}}\n\nIn 1906, Estrada faced serious revolts against his rule; the rebels were supported by the governments of some of the other [[Central America]]n nations, but Estrada succeeded in putting them down. Elections were held by the people against the will of Estrada Cabrera and thus he had the president-elect murdered in retaliation. In 1907, the brothers Avila Echeverr\u00eda and group of friends decided to kill the president using a bomb along his way. They came from prominent families in Guatemala and studied in foreign universities, but when they returned to their homeland, they found a situation where everybody live in constant fear and the president ruled without any opposition.{{sfn|de Aerenlund|2006|p=}}\n\nEverything was carefully planned. When Estrada Cabrera went for a ride in his carriage, the bomb exploded, killing the horse and the driver, but only slightly injuring the President. Since their attack failed and they were forced to take their own lives; their families also suffered, as they were jailed in the infamous ''Penitenciar\u00eda Central''. Conditions in the Penitentiary were cruel and foul. Political offenses were tortured daily and their screams could be heard all over the Penitentiary. Prisoners regularly died under these conditions since political crimes had no pardon.{{sfn|de Aerenlund|2006|p=}} It has been suggested that the extreme despotic characteristics of Estrada did not emerge until after an attempt on his life in 1907.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=146}}\n\nEstrada Cabrera continued in power until forced to resign by new revolts in 1920. By that time, his power had declined drastically and he was reliant on the loyalty of a few generals. While the United States threatened intervention if he was removed through revolution, a bipartisan coalition came together to remove him from the presidency. He was removed from office after the national assembly charged that he was mentally incompetent, and appointed Carlos Herrera in his place on 8 April 1920.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=27}}\n\nIn 1920, prince [[Wilhelm of Sweden]] visited Guatemala and made a very objective description of both Guatemalan society and Estrada Cabrera government in his book ''Between two continents, notes from a journey in Central America, 1920''.{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=148-209}} The prince explained the dynamics of the Guatemalan society at the time pointing out that even though it called itself a \"Republic\", Guatemala had three sharply defined classes:{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=152}}\n\n# [[criollo people|Criollos]]: a minority conformed originally by ancient families descendants of the Spaniards that conquered Central America and that by 1920 conformed both political parties in the country. By 1920, they were mixed to a large extended with foreigners and the great majority had Indian blood in their veins.{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=153}} They led the country both politically and intellectually partly because their education, although poor for European standards of the time, was enormously superior to the rest of the people of the country, partly because only criollos were allowed in the main political parties{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=152}} and also because their families controlled and for the most part owner the cultivated parts of the country.{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=153}}\n# Ladinos: middle class.

After the crash of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 1929, the peasant system established by Barrios in 1875 to jumpstart coffee production in the country{{sfn|Marf\u00ednez Pel\u00e1ez|1990|p=842}} was not good enough anymore, and Ubico was forced to implement a system of [[debt slavery]] and forced labor to make sure that there was enough labor available for the coffee plantations and that the UFCO workers were readily available.{{sfn|Mart\u00ednez Pel\u00e1ez|1990|p=842}}\n\nAllegedly, he passed laws allowing landowners to execute workers as a \"disciplinary\" measure.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Immerman|1983|p=34-37}}{{sfn|Cullather|2006|p=9-10}}{{sfn|Rabe|1988|p=43}}{{sfn|McCreery|1994|pp=316\u2013317}} He also openly identified as a fascist; he admired [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], saying at one point: \"I am like Hitler.

Initially, he had planned to hand over power to the former director of police, General Roderico Anzueto, whom he felt he could control. But his advisors noted that Anzueto's pro-Nazi sympathies had made him very unpopular, and that he would not be able to control the military. So Ubico instead chose to select a triumvirate of Major General Bueneventura Pi\u00f1eda, Major General Eduardo Villagr\u00e1n Ariza, and General [[Federico Ponce Vaides]]. The three generals promised to convene the national assembly to hold an election for a provisional president, but when the congress met on 3 July, soldiers held everyone at gunpoint and forced them to vote for General Ponce rather than the popular civilian candidate, Dr. Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n. Ponce, who had previously retired from military service due to alcoholism, took orders from Ubico and kept many of the officials who had worked in the Ubico administration. The repressive policies of the Ubico administration were continued.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Immerman|1983|p=39-40}}<ref>Jonas, 1991: [https://books.google.com/books?id=48YsPvIZg9oC&pg=PA22 p. 22]</ref>\n\nOpposition groups began organizing again, this time joined by many prominent political and military leaders, who deemed the Ponce regime unconstitutional. Among the military officers in the opposition were Jacobo \u00c1rbenz and Major [[Francisco Javier Arana]]. Ubico had fired \u00c1rbenz from his teaching post at the ''Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica'', and since then \u00c1rbenz had been living in El Salvador, organizing a band of revolutionary exiles. On 19 October 1944 a small group of soldiers and students led by \u00c1rbenz and Arana attacked the National Palace in what later became known as the \"October Revolution\".<ref>Immerman, 1983: [https://books.google.com/books?id=erAkfz6c9HoC&pg=PA41 pp. 41\u201343]</ref> Ponce was defeated and driven into exile; and \u00c1rbenz, Arana, and a lawyer name Jorge Toriello established a [[Military junta|junta]]. They declared that democratic elections would be held before the end of the year.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|p=13}}\n\nThe winner of the 1944 elections was a teaching major named [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo]], PhD, who had earned a scholarship in Argentina during the government of general [[L\u00e1zaro Chac\u00f3n]] due to his superb professor skills. Ar\u00e9valo remained in South America during a few years, working as a University professor in several countries. Back in Guatemala during the early years of the [[Jorge Ubico]] regime, his colleagues asked him to present a project to the president to create the Faculty of Humanism at the [[University of San Carlos|National University]], to which Ubico was strongly opposed. Realizing the dictatorial nature of Ubico, Ar\u00e9valo left Guatemala and went back to Argentina. He went back to Guatemala after the 1944 Revolution and ran under a coalition of leftist parties known as the ''[[Revolutionary Action Party|Partido Acci\u00f3n Revolucionaria]]'' (\"Revolutionary Action Party\", PAR), and won 85% of the vote in elections that are widely considered to have been fair and open.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|p=14}}\n\nAr\u00e9valo implemented social reforms, including minimum wage laws, increased educational funding, near-universal suffrage (excluding illiterate women), and labor reforms. But many of these changes only benefited the upper-middle classes and did little for the peasant agricultural laborers who made up the majority of the population. Although his reforms were relatively moderate, he was widely disliked by the United States government, the Catholic Church, large landowners, employers such as the United Fruit Company, and Guatemalan military officers, who viewed his government as inefficient, corrupt, and heavily influenced by Communists. At least 25 coup attempts took place during his presidency, mostly led by wealthy liberal military officers.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=15\u201316}}{{sfn|Immerman|1983|p=48}}\n\n=== Presidency of Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo (1945\u20131951)===\n{{Main|Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo}}\n\n\u00c1rbenz served as defense minister under President Ar\u00e9valo. He was the first minister of this portfolio, since it was previously called the ''Ministry of War''. In 1947, Dr. Ar\u00e9valo, in company with a friend and two Russian dancers who were visiting Guatemala, had a terrible car accident on the road to Panajachel: fell into a ravine and was seriously injured, while all his companions were killed. The official party leaders signed a pact with Lieutenant Colonel Arana, in which he pledged not to attempt any coup against the ailing president, in exchange for the revolutionary parties as the official candidate in the next election. However, the recovery of the sturdy president was almost miraculous and soon he was able to take over the government. Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Javier Arana had accepted this pact because he wanted to be known as a Democratic hero of the uprising against Ponce and believed that the ''Barranco Pact'' ensured his position when the time of the presidential elections came.{{sfn|Sabino|2007|p=42-52}}\n\nArana was a very influential person in Ar\u00e9valo government, and had managed to be nominated as the next presidential candidate, ahead of Captain Arbenz, who was told that because of his young age he would have no problem in waiting turn to the next election.{{sfn|Sabino|2007|p=42-52}} Arana died in a gun battle against military civilian who wanted to capture him on 18 July 1949, at the Bridge of Glory, in [[Amatitl\u00e1n]], where he and his assistant commander had gone to check on weapons and that had been seized at the Aurora Air Base a few days before  There are different versions about who ambushed him, and those who ordered the attack;  Arbenz and Ar\u00e9valo have been accused of instigating an attempt to get Arana out of the presidential picture.{{sfn|Sabino|2007|p=42-52}}\n\nThe death of Lieutenant Colonel Arana is of critical importance in the history of Guatemala, because it was a pivotal event in the history of the Guatemalan revolution: his death not only paved the way for the election of Colonel Arbenz as president of the republic in 1950 but also caused an acute crisis in the government of Dr. Ar\u00e9valo Bermejo, who all of a sudden had against him an army that was more faithful to Arana than to him, and elite civilian groups that used the occasion to protest strongly against his government.{{sfn|Sabino|2007|p=42-52}}\n\nBefore his death, Arana had planned to run in the upcoming 1950 presidential elections. His death left \u00c1rbenz without any serious contenders in the elections (leading some, including the CIA and U.S. military intelligence, to speculate that \u00c1rbenz personally had him eliminated for this reason). \u00c1rbenz got more than 3 times as many votes as the runner-up, [[Miguel Yd\u00edgoras Fuentes]]. Fuentes claimed that electoral fraud benefited \u00c1rbenz; however scholars have pointed out that while fraud may possibly have given \u00c1rbenz some of his votes, it was not the reason that he won the election.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|p=16}} In 1950s Guatemala, only literate men were able to vote by secret ballot; illiterate men and literate women voted by open ballot. Illiterate women were not enfranchised at all.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1992|p=84}}\n\nFor the campaign of 1950, Arbenz asked [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fortuny]] \u2013 a high-ranking member of the Guatemalan Communist party \u2013 to write some speeches. The central theme of these was the land reform, the \"pet project\" of Arbenz. They shared a comfortable victory in elections in late 1950 and, thereafter, the tasks of government. While many of the leaders of the ruling coalition fought hard closeness to the president seeking personal benefits, the leaders of the Guatemalan Labor Party, and especially Fortuny, were the closest advisors and Arbenz were his private practice.\n\nThe election of \u00c1rbenz alarmed U.S. State Department officials, who stated that Arana \"has always represented <nowiki>[</nowiki>the<nowiki>]</nowiki> only positive conservative element in <nowiki>[</nowiki>the<nowiki>]</nowiki> Ar\u00e9valo administration\", that his death would \"strengthen Leftist<nowiki>[</nowiki>sic<nowiki>]</nowiki> materially\", and that \"developments forecast sharp leftist trend within <nowiki>[</nowiki>the<nowiki>]</nowiki> government.\"{{sfn|Gleijeses|1992|p=124}}\n\n=== Presidency of Jacobo \u00c1rbenz Guzman (1951\u20131954)===\n{{Main|Jacobo \u00c1rbenz Guzman}}\n\n[[File:Posesionarbenz.jpg|thumb|200px|Inauguration of colonel [[Jacobo \u00c1rbenz]] as president of Guatemala in 1951.]]\n\nIn his inaugural address, \u00c1rbenz promised to convert Guatemala from \"a backward country with a predominantly feudal economy into a modern capitalist state.\"{{sfn|Streeter|2000|p=18}} He declared that he intended to reduce dependency on foreign markets and dampen the influence of foreign corporations over Guatemalan politics.{{sfn|Fried|1983|p=52}} He also stated that he would modernize Guatemala's infrastructure and do so without the aid of foreign capital.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1992|p=149}}\n\nBased on his plan of government, he did the following:\n# Promulgated the Decree 900, to expropriate idle land from UFCO.\n# Began construction of the Atlantic Highway\n# Began construction of the Santo Tomas de Castilla port where port Mat\u00edas de G\u00e1lvez used to be, to compete with Puerto Barrios, UFCO's port.\n# Began studies for ''Jurun Marinal\u00e1'' generation plant to compete with the electric company in the hands of Americans.\n\n\u00c1rbenz was a [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] and governed as a European-style [[democratic socialist]], and took great inspiration from [[Franklin D.

The law empowered the government to create a network of agrarian councils which would be in charge of expropriating uncultivated land on estates that were larger than {{convert|672|acre|km2|1}}.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|p=18}} The land was then allocated to individual families. Owners of expropriated land were compensated according to the worth of the land claimed in May 1952 tax assessments (which they had often dramatically understated to avoid paying taxes). Land was paid for in 25-year bonds with a 3 percent interest rate.{{sfn|Rabe|1988|p=}} The program was in effect for 18 months, during which it distributed {{convert|1500000|acre|km2}} to about 100,000 families. \u00c1rbenz himself, a landowner through his wife, gave up {{convert|1700|acre|km2|0}} of his own land in the land reform program.<ref>{{cite book|title=Talons of the Eagle: Dynamics of U.S.-Latin American Relations|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-512997-0|author=Smith, Peter H.|page=135}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, the reform was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, however the democratically elected Congress later impeached four judges associated with the ruling.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1992|p=155, 163}}\n\nDecree 900, for the Agrarian Reform in Guatemala created the possibility of gaining crops for those field workers who had no land of their own. The effect of this law was similar to what occurred in Europe after the bubonic plague in the Middle Ages: after the plague, which killed one third of Europe's population at the time, the number of landowners decreased, which released many of the terrestrial land, increased supply and lowered land price. At the same time, many farmers also died from the plague, so that the labor force declined; this shift in supply of workers increased wages. The economic effects of the plague are very similar to those caused by the land reform in Guatemala: During the first harvest after the implementation of the law, the average income of farmers increased from Q225.00/year TO Q700.00/year. Some analysts say that conditions in Guatemala improved after the reform and that there was a \"fundamental transformation of agricultural technology as a result of the decrease labor supply.\" Rising living standards also happened in Europe in the fifteenth century, while large-scale technological advances occurred. Missing workforce after the plague was \"the mother of invention.\" The benefits from the reform were not limited solely to the working class of fields: There were increases in consumption, production and domestic private investment.\n\n==== Construction of transport infrastructure ====\n\n[[File:Guatemala railways.svg|200px|thumb|Map of railway lines in Guatemala and El Salvador, which were owned by the IRCA, the subsidiary of the United Fruit Company that controlled the railroad in both countries, while the only Atlantic port was controlled by the Great White Fleet, also a UFCO's company.]]\n\nIn order to establish the necessary physical infrastructure to make possible the \"independent\" and national capitalist development that could get rid of extreme dependence on the United States and break the American monopolies operating in the country, basically the economy of the banana enclave, Arbenz and his government began the planning and construction of the Atlantic Highway, which was intended to compete in the market with the monopoly on land transport exerted by the [[United Fruit Company]], through one of its subsidiaries: the International Railways of Central America (IRCA), which had the concession since 1904, when it was granted by then president [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]]. Construction of the highway began by the Roads Department of the Ministry of Communications, with the help of the military engineering battalion. It was planned to be built parallel along the railway line, as much as possible. The construction of the new port was also aimed to break another UFCO monopoly: Puerto Barrios was owned and operated solely by The Great White Fleet, another UFCO's subsidiary.\n\n==== National power plant Jurun Marinal\u00e1 ====\n\n[[File:Jurun Marinal\u00e1.jpg|200px|thumb|The Jurun Marinal\u00e1 power plant was conceived during the Arbenz government to compete with the generation of the Electricity Company of Guatemala, which at that time was an American company and was using foreign oil instead of natural resources in Guatemala. The power was not completed until 1968, fourteen years after Arbenz was taken out of power.]]\n[[File:Jurun marinala.jpg|200px|thumb|Marinal\u00e1 power plant advertisement during Arbenz government.]]\n\nThe Jurun Marinal\u00e1 electric power generation plant was planned as the first national hydroelectric power plant in Guatemala. The goal was to disrupt the monopoly of the Electric Company, a subsidiary of American Electric Bond and Share (Ebasco), which did not make use of indigenous water resources, but ran fossil fuel-powered plants, thus creating a drain on foreign currency reserves. Owing to its massive economic importance, construction continued beyond the \u00c1rbenz presidency. The plant was finally completed under President [[Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro]] in 1968. It is located in the village of Agua Blanca, inside El Salto, [[Escuintla]].\n\n==== Catholic Campaign national pilgrimage against communism ====\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]], who possessed a large share of power in Central America during the Colonial Era, was gradually losing it after the emancipation from Spain. First, it was the struggle of the liberals who overtook power from Guatemalan conservatives (among whom was included the Major Clergy of the Church);  conservatives and the Church lost all of their power quota in the provinces of Central America, Guatemala remaining as their last bastion. In 1838, with the fall of the liberal President Mariano Galvez, the figure of Lieutenant General Rafael Carrera arose and became the country's conservative leader. He rallied his party and the Church back to power, at least in the province of Guatemala. With this state of affairs, the Central American Federation could not be carried out because it was liberal in nature and Guatemala's military power and that of its leader Carrera were invincible in his time;  so much so, that Carrera eventually founded the Republic of Guatemala on 21 March 1847. After Carrera's death in 1865, Guatemalan Liberals saw their chance to seize power again, and conducted the Liberal Revolution in 1871. Since that time, the attacks on the senior clergy of the [[Catholic Church]] raged in Guatemala and secular education, freedom of religion, the expulsion of several religious orders and the expropriation of many church property were decreed. This situation continued throughout all the liberal governments that followed, until October Revolution in 1944, in which the religious situation worsened: now the attacks towards the Church were not only economic, but also religious, as many revolutionaries began to declare themselves opposed to any kind of religion.\n\nBy 1951, Archbishop [[Mariano Rossell Arellano]] found that it was urgent to recover the elite position of the Catholic Church in Guatemala, and for that reason he allied himself to the interests of the [[United Fruit Company]] through the National Liberation Movement and aimed to overthrow the revolutionary governments, which he branded as [[atheists]] and [[communists]]. After the consecration of the Shrine of Esquipulas (1950), and as part of the smear campaign launched against the Arbenz government, he requested sculptor Julio Urruela V\u00e1squez to carve a replica of the Christ of Esquipulas, which was transferred to bronze in 1952 and converted the following year in symbol and banner of the national pilgrimage against Communism. This Christ was then appointed as ''Commander in Chief'' of the forces of the National Liberation Movement during the invasion of June 1954.\n\nOn 4 April 1954, Rossell Arellano issued a pastoral letter in which he criticized the progress of communism in the country, and made a call to Guatemalans to rise up and fight the common enemy of God and the homeland. This pastoral was distributed throughout the country.\n\n=== National Liberation (1954) ===\n\n====Agrarian Reform and UFCo conflict====\n\nIn 1953, when the government implemented [[Agrarian Reform]], it intended to redistribute large holdings of unused land to peasants, both Ladino and Amerindian, for them to develop for subsistence farming. It expropriated 250,000 of 350,000 ''[[manzanas]]'' held by the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFC). According to the government's Decree 900, it would redistribute the land for agricultural purposes. UFCO continued to hold thousands of acres in pasture as well as substantial forest reserves. The Guatemalan government had offered the company a Q 609,572 in compensation for the appropriated land.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1992|pp=201\u2013215}} The company fought the land expropriation, making several legal arguments. It said the government had misinterpreted its own law. The Agrarian Reform Law was directed at redistributing unused land able to be developed for agricultural purposes. Thus land in pasture, specified forest cover and under cultivation was to be left with the owners and untouched by the expropriators. The company argued that most of the land taken from them was cultivated and in use, so it was illegal for the government to take it.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1992|pp=210\u2013215}}\n\nSecondly, they argued that the offered compensation was insufficient for the amount and value of the land taken. However, the valuations of United Fruit Company's rural property were based on the values declared by the company in its own tax filings. In 1945, Arevalo's administration ordered new assessments, to be complete by 1948. UFCo had submitted the assessment by the due date; but, when the Agrarian Reform was implemented, the company declared that they wanted the value of its property changed from the values the company had previously used to dodge taxes. The government had investigated in 1951, but a new assessment was never completed. UFCo said that the 1948 assessment was outdated, and claimed its land value was much greater. They had estimated just compensation would be as high as Q 15,854,849, nearly twenty times more than what the Guatemalan government had offered.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1992|pp=201\u2013215}}\n\nThe U.S. State Department and the embassy actively began to support the position of UFCo, which was a major US company. The Guatemalan government had to fight the pressure. The US officially acknowledged that Guatemala had the right to conduct their own politics and business, but U.S. representatives said they were trying to protect UFCo, a US company that generated much revenue and contributed to the US economy.{{sfn|Bucheli|2006|p=}} Arbenz's administration said that Guatemala needed Agrarian Reform to improve its own economy. Arbenz said he would adopt policies for a nationalist economic development if necessary. He argued that all foreign investment would be subject to Guatemalan laws. Arbenz was firm in promoting the Agrarian Reform and within a couple of years had acted quickly; he claimed that Guatemalan government was not prepared to make an exception for the U.S. concerning Decree 900 and that it was not Guatemalan's fault that the American corporation had lied in its tax forms and declared an artificially low value on their land.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1992|pp=201\u2013215}}\n\nBecause Arbenz could not be pressured to take into consideration the arguments made to prevent expropriation from UFCo, his government was undermined with propaganda. For U.S. the national security was also highly important. They had combined both political and economic interests. The fear of allowing communist practices in Guatemala was shared by the urban elite and middle classes,{{sfn|Sabino|2007|p=115}} who would not relinquish their privileges that easily.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1992|pp=201\u2013215}} The local media-such as newspapers ''[[El Imparcial]]'' and ''La Hora''- took advantage of the freedom of press of the regime, and with the sponsorship of UFCo were critical of communism and of the government's legal recognition of the party. The opposing political parties organized anticommunism campaigns; thousands of people appeared at the periodic rallies, and the membership in anticommunist organizations had grown steadily.{{sfn|Sabino|2007|p=116}}\n\n==== Arrival of John Peurifoy to Guatemala ====\n\nBetween 1950 and 1955, during the government of General Eisenhower in the United States, a witch hunt for communists was conducted: [[McCarthyism]]. This was characterized by persecuting innocent people by mere suspicion, with unfounded accusations, interrogation, loss of labor, passport denial, and even imprisonment. These mechanisms of social control and repression in the United States skirted dangerously with the totalitarian and fascist methods.\n\nOne of the main characters of [[McCarthyism]] was [[John Peurifoy]], who was sent as the ambassador of the United States to Guatemala, as this was the first country in the American sphere of influence after [[World War II]] that included elements openly communists in his government. He came from Greece, where he had already done considerable anticommunist activity, and was installed as ambassador in November 1953, when [[Carlos Castillo Armas]] was already organizing his tiny revoucionary army. After a long meeting, Peurifoy made it clear to President Arbenz that the US was worried about the communist elements in his government, and then reported to the [[Department of State]] that the Guatemalan leader was not a communist, but that surely a Communist leader would come after him; furthermore, in January 1954 he told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine: ''American public opinion could force us to take some measures to prevent Guatemala from falling into the orbit of international communism''.\n\n====Operation PBSUCCESS====\n{{Main|Operation PBSUCCESS}}\n\nThe Communist Party was never the center of the Communist movement in Guatemala until [[Jacobo \u00c1rbenz]] came to power in 1951. Prior to 1951, Communism lived within the urban labor forces in small study groups during 1944 to 1953 which it had a tremendous influence on these urban labor forces. Despite its small size within Guatemala, many leaders were extremely vocal about their beliefs (for instance, in their protests and, more importantly, their literature). In 1949, in Congress, the Communist party only had less than forty members, however, by 1953 it went up to nearly four thousand. Before Arbenz come to power in 1951, the Communist movement preferred to carry out many of their activities through the so-called mass organization. In addition to Arbenz success, Guatemalan Communist Party moved forward its activities into public.\n\nAfter Jacobo Arbenz came to power in 1951, he extended political freedom, allowing Communists in Guatemala to participate in politics. This move by Arbenz let many opponents in Ubico's regime to recognize themselves as Communists. By 1952, Arbenz supported a land reform, and took unused agricultural land, about {{convert|225,000|acre|km2|sigfig=2}}, from owners who had large properties, and made it available to rural workers and farmers. These lands were to be taken from the United Fruit Company with compensation; however, the UFC believed the compensation was not enough. Meantime, Arbenz allowed the Communist Party to organize and include leaders notably his adviser who were leftist. The propaganda effort that was led by United Fruit Company against the revolution in Guatemala persuaded the U.S. government to fight against communism in Guatemala. The United States clutched on small details to prove the existence of widespread Communism in Guatemala. The Eisenhower administration at the time in the U.S. were not happy about the Arbenz government, they considered Arbenz to be too close to Communism; there have been reports that Arbenz's wife was a Communist and part of the Communist Party in Guatemala. Even though it was impossible for the U.S. to gather evidence and information about Guatemala's relations to the Soviet Union, Americans wanted to believe that Communism existed in Guatemala. Many groups of Guatemalan exiles were armed and trained by the CIA, and commanded by Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas they invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954. The Americans called it an Anti-Communist Coup against Arbenz. The coup was supported by CIA radio broadcasts and so the Guatemalan army refused to resist the coup, Arbenz was forced to resign. In 1954, a military government replaced Arbenz' government and disbanded the legislature and they arrested communist leaders, Castillo Armas became president.\n\nArbenz proceeded to nationalize and redistribute un-utilized land owned by the [[United Fruit Company]], which had a practical monopoly on Guatemalan fruit production and some industry. In response, United Fruit lobbied the [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration to remove Arbenz. Of still greater importance, though, was the widespread American concern about the possibility of a so-called \"[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] beachhead\"<ref>{{cite book | author=Cullather, Nick | title=''Secret History: The CIA's classified account of its operations in Guatemala, 1952\u20131954'' | publisher=Stanford University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-8047-3311-2}}, pg 17, quoting [[Allen Dulles]]</ref> opening up in the Western Hemisphere.

This led to a CIA-orchestrated coup in 1954, known as [[Operation PBSUCCESS]], which saw Arbenz toppled and forced into exile by Colonel [[Carlos Castillo Armas]]. Despite most Guatemalans' attachment to the original ideals of the 1944 uprising, some private sector leaders and the military began to believe that Arbenz represented a Communist threat and supported his overthrow, hoping that a successor government would continue the more moderate reforms started by Arevalo. After the CIA coup, hundreds of Guatemalans were rounded up and killed. Documents obtained by the [[National Security Archive]] revealed that the CIA was involved in planning assassinations of enemies of the new military government, should the coup be successful.{{sfn|Blakeley|2009|p=92}}\n\n==Earthquake of 1976==\n[[Image:GuateQuake1976HotelTerminalA.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Damaged hotel, Guatemala City, 1976]]\n{{Main|1976 Guatemala earthquake}}\n{{Expand section|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Civil war (1960\u20131996)==\n{{Main|Guatemalan Civil War}}\n\nThe government, right-wing paramilitary organizations, and left-wing insurgents were all engaged in the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] (1960\u201396).

In 1960, then Army captain [[Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia]] inherited Saquixquib and Punta de Bolonc\u00f3 farms in northeastern Sebol. In 1963 he bought the farm \"San Fernando\" El Palmar de Sejux and finally bought the \"Sepur\" farm near San Fernando. During those years, Lucas was in the Guatemalan legislature and lobbied in Congress to boost investment in that area of the country.{{sfn|Solano|2012|p=10}}\n\nIn those years, the importance of the region was in livestock, exploitation of precious export wood and archaeological wealth. Timber contracts were granted to multinational companies such as Murphy Pacific Corporation from California, which invested US$30&nbsp;million for the colonization of southern Pet\u00e9n and Alta Verapaz, and formed the North Impulsadora Company.

In 1975, the organization had spread around the area of the mountains of northern municipalities of Nebaj and Chajul. As part of its strategy EGP agreed to perform acts that notoriety was obtained and through which also symbolize the establishment of a \"social justice\" against the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the judicial and administrative organs of the State. They saw also that with these actions the indigenous rural population of the region is identified with the insurgency, thus motivating joining their ranks. As part of this plan was agreed to so-called \"executions\". To determine who would be these people subject to \"execution\", the EGP attended complaints received from the public. For example, they selected two victims: Guillermo Monz\u00f3n, who was a military Commissioner in Ixc\u00e1n and Jos\u00e9 Luis Arenas, the largest landowner in the area of Ixc\u00e1n, and who had been reported to the EGP for allegedly having land conflicts with neighboring settlements and abusing their workers.{{sfn|Comisi\u00f3n para el Esclarecimiento Hist\u00f3rico: Caso No. 59|1999|p=1}}<ref group=lower-alpha>Jos\u00e9 Luis Arenas, who at that time a journalist called \"Ixc\u00e1n Tiger\" had been active in Guatemalan politics.

In the presidential term of Carlos Arana Osorio (1970\u20131974) Arenas was in charge of the Promotion and Development of Pet\u00e9n (FYDEP).

In front of his office there were approximately two to three hundred people to receive their payment and four members of EGP mixed among farmers. Subsequently, the guerrilla members destroyed the communication radio of the farm and executed Arenas. After having murdered Jos\u00e9 Luis Arenas, guerrilla members spoke in Ixil language to the farmers, informing them that they were members of the Guerrilla Army of the Poor and had killed the \"Tiger Ixc\u00e1n.\"  They requested to prepare beasts to help the injured and were transported to Chajul to receive medical care.

This coordination between legal groups came from the [[Ej\u00e9rcito Guerrillero de los Pobres|Guerrilla Army of the Poor]] (EGP), a guerrilla group that had appeared in 1972 and had its headquarters in the oil rich region of northern Quich\u00e9 department -i.e., the Ixil Triangle of Ixc\u00e1n, Nebaj and Chajul in [[Franja Transversal del Norte]].{{sfn|Solano|2012|p=3-26}}  Although not strictly an armed group, FERG sought confrontation with government forces all the time, giving prominence to measures that could actually degenerate into mass violence and paramilitary activity. Its members were not interested in working within an institutional framework and never asked permission for their public demonstrations or actions.{{sfn|CEUR|2009|p=}}\n\nOn 7 March 1978, Lucas Garcia was elected President;  shortly after, on 29 May 1978 -in the late days of General Laugerud Garc\u00eda government- in the central square of [[Panz\u00f3s]], [[Alta Verapaz]], members of the Zacapa Military Zone attacked a peaceful peasant demonstration, killing a lot of people. The deceased, indigenous peasants who had been summoned in place, were fighting for the legalization of public lands they had occupied for years. Their struggle faced them directly with investors who wanted to exploit the mineral wealth of the area, particularly oil reserves -by Basic Resources International and Shenandoah Oil-{{sfn|Solano|2012|p=3-26}} and nickel -EXMIBAL.{{sfn|Rakosy|2012|p=}}  The Panz\u00f3s Massacre caused a stir at the University by the high number of victims and conflicts arose from the exploitation of natural resources by foreign companies. In 1978, for example, Osorio Paz and other university received death threats for their outspoken opposition to the construction of an inter-oceanic pipeline that would cross the country to facilitate oil exploration.{{sfn|CEUR|2009|p=}} On 8 June the AEU organized a massive protest in downtown Guatemala City where speakers denounced the slaughter of Panz\u00f3s and expressed their repudiation of Laugerud Garc\u00eda regime in stronger terms than ever before.{{sfn|CEUR|2009|p=}}\n\n==== Escalation of violence ====\n\nAfter the \"execution\" of Jos\u00e9 Luis Arenas population of Hom, Ixtupil, Sajsivan and Sotzil villages, neighbors of La Perla and annexes, increased support for the new guerrilla movement, mainly due to the land dispute that peasants kept with the owners of the farm for several years and that the execution was seen as an act of \"social justice\".\n\nThe murder owner of the farm \"La Perla\", located in the municipality of Chajul, resulted in the escalation of violence in the area: part of the population moved closer to the guerrillas, while another part of the inhabitants of Hom kept out of the insurgency. In 1979, the owners of the farm \"La Perla\" established links with the army and for the first time a military detachment was installed within the property; in this same building the first civil patrol of the area was established. The Army high command, meanwhile, was very pleased with the initial results of the operation and was convinced it had succeeded in destroying most of the social basis of EGP, which had to be expelled from the \"Ixil Triangle\". At this time the presence of EGP in the area decreased significantly due to the repressive actions of the Army, who developed its concept of \"enemy\" without necessarily including the notion of armed combatants; the officers who executed the plan were instructed to destroy all towns suspect of cooperate with EGP and eliminate all sources of resistance. Army units operating in the \"Ixil Triangle\" belonged to the Mariscal Zavala Brigade, stationed in [[Guatemala City]]. Moreover, although the guerrillas did not intervene directly when the army attacked the civilian population allegedly because they lacked supplies and ammunition, it did support some survival strategies. It streamlined, for example, \"survival plans\" designed to give evacuation instructions in assumption that military incursions took place. Most of the population began to participate in the schemes finding that them represented their only alternative to military repression.{{sfn|Comisi\u00f3n para el Esclarecimiento Hist\u00f3rico: Caso No. 61|1999|p=}}\n\n===Lucas Garcia presidency===\n{{Main|Fernando Romeo Lucas Garc\u00eda}}\n\nThe election of [[Fernando Romeo Lucas Garc\u00eda|Lucas Garc\u00eda]] on 7 March 1978 marked the beginning of a full return to the counterinsurgency practices of the Arana period. This was compounded by the strong reaction of the Guatemalan military to the situation unfolding in Nicaragua at the time, where the popularly supported [[Sandinista]] insurgency was on the verge of toppling the [[Somoza]] regime. With the aim of preventing an analogous situation from unfolding in Guatemala, the government intensified its repressive campaign against the predominantly indigenous mass movement. The repression not only intensified, but became more overt.\n\nOn 4 August 1978, high school and university students, along with other popular movement sectors, organized the mass movement's first urban protest of the Lucas Garc\u00eda period. The protests, intended as a march against violence, were attended by an estimated 10,000 people. The new minister of the interior under President Lucas Garc\u00eda, Donaldo Alvarez Ruiz, promised to break up any protests done without government permission. Having refused to ask for permission, the protesters were met by the Pelot\u00f3n Modelo (Model Platoon) of the National Police. Employing new anti-riot gear donated by the [[United States Government]], Platoon agents surrounded marchers and tear-gassed them. Students were forced to retreat and dozens of people, mostly school-aged adolescents, were hospitalized.<ref>Amnesty International 1979b: 7; interviews</ref> This was followed by more protests and death squad killings throughout the later part of the year. In September 1978 a [[general strike]] broke out to protest sharp increases in [[public transportation]] fares; the government responded harshly, arresting dozens of protesters and injuring many more. However, as a result of the campaign, the government agreed to the protesters' demands, including the establishment of a [[public transportation]] [[subsidy]]. Fearful that this concession would encourage more protests, the military government, along with state-sponsored [[paramilitary]] [[death squads]], generated an unsafe situation for public leaders.\n\nThe administrator of a large cemetery in Guatemala City informed the press that in the first half of 1978, more than 760 unidentified bodies had arrived at the cemetery, all apparent victims of death squads.<ref>{{cite journal|title=International Bulletin|year=1979|volume=4\u20136|page=Page 197}}</ref> [[Amnesty International]] stated that disappearances were an \"epidemic\" in Guatemala and reported more than 2,000 killings between mid-1978 and 1980.

In the subsequent police raid, over the protests of the Spanish ambassador, the police attacked the building with incendiary explosives. A fire ensued as police prevented those inside of the embassy from exiting the building. In all, 36 people were killed in the fire. The funeral of the victims (including the hitherto obscure father of [[Rigoberta Mench\u00fa]], Vicente Mench\u00fa) attracted hundreds of thousands of mourners, and a new guerrilla group was formed commemorating the date, the ''Frente patriotico 31 de enero'' (Patriotic Front of 31 January).

The daily number of killings by official and unofficial security forces increased from an average of 20 to 30 in 1979 to a conservative estimate of 30 to 40 daily in 1980. Human rights sources estimated 5,000 Guatemalans were killed by the government for \"political reasons\" in 1980 alone, making it the worst human rights violator in the hemisphere after [[El Salvador]].<ref>\"Guatemala and El Salvador: Latin America's worst human rights violators in 1980\" The Council on Hemispheric Affairs</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ramcharan|first=B.G.|title=The Right to Life in International Law|year=1985|publisher=Hague Academy of International Law: Center for Studies and Research|page=337}}</ref> In a report titled ''Guatemala: A Government Program of Political Murder,'' [[Amnesty International]] stated, \"Between January and November of 1980, some 3,000 people described by government representatives as \"subversives\" and \"criminals\" were either shot on the spot in political assassinations or seized and murdered later; at least 364 others seized in this period have not yet been accounted for.\" <ref>{{cite book|title=Guatemala: A Government Program of Political Murder|year=1981|publisher=Amnesty International Publications|page=5}}</ref>\n\nThe repression and excessive force used by the government against the opposition was such that it became source of contention within Lucas Garcia's administration itself. This contention within the government caused Lucas Garcia's Vice President [[Francisco Villagr\u00e1n Kramer]] to resign from his position on 1 September 1980. In his resignation, Kramer cited his disapproval of the government's human rights record as one of the primary reasons for his resignation. He then went into voluntary exile in the United States, taking a position in the Legal Department of the [[Inter-American Development Bank]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/Guatemala81eng/chap.9.htm |title=Guatemala 1981 \u2013 Chapter IX |publisher=Cidh.oas.org |date= |accessdate=18 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Insurgent mobilization====\nThe effects of state repression on the population further radicalized individuals within the mass movement and led to increased popular support for the insurgency. In late 1979, the EGP expanded its influence, controlling a large amount of territory in the Ixil Triangle in El Quiche and holding many demonstrations in Nebaj, Chajul and Cotzal.{{sfn|Richards|1985|p=94}} At the same time the EGP was expanding its presence in the Altiplano, a new insurgent movement called the ORPA (Revolutionary Organization of Armed People) made itself known. Composed of local youths and university intellectuals, the ORPA developed out of a movement called the Regional de Occidente, which split from the FAR-PGT in 1971. The ORPA's leader, Rodrigo Asturias (a former activist with the PGT and first-born son of [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias]]), formed the organization after returning from exile in [[Mexico]].<ref>Concerned Guatemala Scholars (1982), ''Guatemala, Dare to Struggle, Dare to Win'', p. 40</ref> The ORPA established an operational base in the mountains and rain-forests above the coffee plantations of southwestern Guatemala and in the [[Lake Atitlan|Atitlan]] where it enjoyed considerable popular support.<ref>Robert S. Carlsen (2011), ''The War for the Heart and Soul of a Highland Maya Town: Revised Edition'', p. 144</ref> On 18 September 1979, the ORPA made its existence publicly known when it occupied the Mujulia coffee farm in the coffee-growing region of the Quezaltenango province to hold a political education meeting with the workers.<ref>Jonathan L. Fried (1983), ''Guatemala in Rebellion: Unfinished History'', p. 270</ref>\n\nInsurgent movements active in the initial phase of the conflict such as the FAR also began to reemerge and prepare for combat. In 1980, guerrilla operations on both the urban and rural fronts greatly intensified, with the insurgency carrying out a number of overt acts of armed propaganda and assassinations of prominent right-wing Guatemalans and landowners. In 1980, armed insurgents assassinated prominent Ixil landowner Enrique Brol, and president of the CACIF (Coordinating Committee of Agricultural, Commercial, Industrial, and Financial Associations) Alberto Habie.<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline of Guatemalan Civil War|url=http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/report/english/graphics/charts/page74.gif}}</ref>  Encouraged by guerrilla advances elsewhere in Central America, the Guatemalan insurgents, especially the EGP, began to quickly expand their influence through a wide geographic area and across different ethnic groups, thus broadening the appeal of the insurgent movement and providing it with a larger popular base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ciidh/qr/english/chap4.html |title=Scientific Responsibility, Human Rights & Law Program &#124; AAAS \u2013 The World's Largest General Scientific Society |publisher=Shr.aaas.org |date=19 June 2014 |accessdate=18 August 2014}}</ref> In October 1980, a tripartite alliance was formalized between the EGP, the FAR and the ORPA as a precondition for Cuban-backing.{{sfn|Vice President's Task Force on Combating Terrorism|1989|p=86}}\n\nIn early 1981, the insurgency mounted the largest offensive in the country's history. This was followed by an additional offensive towards the end of the year, in which many civilians were forced to participate by the insurgents. Villagers worked with the insurgency to sabotage roads and army establishments, and destroy anything of strategic value to the armed forces.<ref>''Ej\u00e9rcito Guerrillero de los Pobres,'' 1983</ref> By 1981, an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 members of Guatemala's [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] community actively supported the insurgency.

Some families obeyed; others took refuge in the mountains. K'iche's who took refuge in the mountains, were identified by the Army with the guerrillas and underwent a military siege, and continuous attacks that prevented them from getting food, shelter and medical care.\n\n==== La Llorona massacre, El Estor ====\n\nLa Llorona, located about 18 kilometers from El Estor, department of Izabal (part of the Northern Transversal Strip), was a small village with no more than twenty houses. Most of the first settlers arrived from the areas of Senah\u00fa and Panz\u00f3s, both in Alta Verapaz. In 1981, the total population was about 130 people, all belonging to q'eqchi' ethnic group. Few people spoke Spanish and most work in their own cornfields, sporadically working for the local landowners. In the vicinity are the villages El Bongo, Socela, Benque, Rio Pita, Santa Maria, Big Plan and New Hope. Conflicts in the area were related to land tenure, highlighting the uncertainty about the boundaries between farms and communities, and the lack of titles. As in the National Institute of Agrarian Transformation (INTA) was not registered a legitimate owner of land occupied La Llorona, the community remained in the belief that the land belonged to the state, which had taken steps to obtain title property. However, a farmer with great influence in the area occupied part of the land, generating a conflict between him and the community; men of the village, on its own initiative, devised a new boundary between community land and the farmer, but the problem remained dormant.{{sfn|Comisi\u00f3n para el Esclarecimiento Hist\u00f3rico: Caso No. 44|1999|p. 1}}\n\nIn the second half of the seventies were the first news about the presence of guerrillas in the villages, the commander aparacimiento Ramon, talking to people and saying they were the Guerrilla Army of the Poor. They passed many villages asking what problems people had and offering to solve them. The told peasants that the land belonged to the poor and that they should trust them. In 1977, Ramon a -guerilla commander- regularly visited the village of La Llorona and after finding that the issue of land was causing many problems in the community, taught people to practice new measurements, which spread fear among landowners. That same year, the group under Ramon arbitrarily executed the Spanish landowner Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, near El Recreo, which he owner. Following this, a clandestine group of mercenaries, dubbed \"fighters of the rich\" was formed to protect the interests of landlords; public authority of El Estor organized the group and paid its members, stemming from the funding of major landowners. The group, irregular, was related to the military commissioners of the region and with commanders of the Army, although mutual rivalries also took place. The secret organization murdered several people, including victims who had no connection whatsoever with insurgent groups.{{sfn|Comisi\u00f3n para el Esclarecimiento Hist\u00f3rico: Caso No. 44|1999|p. 1}}\n\nIn December 1978, the EGP group leader, Ramon, was captured by soldiers of the military detachment in El Estor and transferred to the military zone of Puerto Barrios; after two years returned to El Estor; but this time as an officer in the Army G2 and joined a group of soldiers that came to the village. On the evening of 28 September 1981, an army officer accompanied by four soldiers and a military commissioner met with about thirty civilians. At seven o'clock, over thirty civilians, mostly from \"Nueva Esperanza', including several 'informants' known to military intelligence, gathered around La Llorona along with some military commissioners and a small group of soldiers and army officers. Then they entered the village. Civilians and commissioners entered twelve houses, and each of them were pulling men and shot them dead outside their own homes; those who tried to escape were also killed. Women who tried to protect their husbands were beatn. While the military commissioners and civilians executed men, soldiers subtracted belongings of the victims; within half an hour, the authors of the assault left the village. The victim bodies, fourteen in all, were in front of houses. Women, despite having been threatened with death if tell what happened, ran to the nearest village, El Bongo, for help. After a few hours, women came back with people who helped to bury the bodies. Days later, widows, with almost 60 fatherless children were welcomed by the parish of El Estor for several days, until the soldiers forced them to return to their village. Two widows of those executed on 29 September established close relations with the military commissioners from Bongo. This situation led to divisions that still exist in the community.{{sfn|Comisi\u00f3n para el Esclarecimiento Hist\u00f3rico: Caso No. 44|1999|p. 1}}\n\nThe economic and social activity was disrupted in the village: widows had to take the jobs of their husbands; because of their lack of knowledge in the cultivation of land, harvested very little corn and beans. There were diseases, especially among children and the elderly, there was no food or clothing. The teacher of the village came only part-time, mostly out of fear, but left after he realized it was not worth to stay because young people had to work. Nor could they spend money on travel. The village had no teacher for the next four years. The events generated finally the breakup of the community. Some village women though that their husbands were killed because of three others who were linked with the guerrillas and were involved in a land dispute.{{sfn|Comisi\u00f3n para el Esclarecimiento Hist\u00f3rico: Caso No. 44|1999|p. 1}}\n\nAccording to the Historical Clarification Commission, the landlord with whom the villagers had the land dispute took advantage of the situation to appropriate another twelve acres of land.{{sfn|Comisi\u00f3n para el Esclarecimiento Hist\u00f3rico: Caso No. 44|1999|p=}}\n\n==== List of other massacres perpetrated by the Army in Franja Transversal del Norte ====\n{{Main|Franja Transversal del Norte}}\n\nThe report of the Recovery of Historical Memory lists 422 massacres committed by both sides in the conflict;{{sfn|Comisi\u00f3n para el Esclarecimiento Hist\u00f3rico: Caso No. 92|1999|p=}} however, it also states that they did the best they could in terms of obtaining information and therefore the list is incomplete; therefore here are the cases that have also been documented in other reports as well.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:white; width:60%; font-size:90%; margin: 1em auto;\"\n|+ style=\"background:#ffffff;\"| '''Chajul, Nebaj and Ixc\u00e1n massacres in Franja Transversal del Norte'''\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n!style=\"background:#659ec7; width:5%;\" | #\n!style=\"background:#659ec7; width:20%;\"| Location\n!style=\"background:#659ec7; width:10%;\"| Department\n!style=\"background:#659ec7; width:10%;\"| Date\n!style=\"background:#659ec7;\"| Root cause\n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|1\n|Ilom (village), [[Chajul]]||Quich\u00e9||23 March 1982||After 1981, repression against Ilom was rampant, ending with the massacre of 96 alleged guerilla members in front of their families on 23 March 1982, as part of Army \"Victoria 82\" plan.

The successes made by the revolutionary forces in Nicaragua against the Somoza regime combined with the insurgency's own successes against the Lucas government led rebel leaders to falsely conclude that a military equilibrium was being reached in Guatemala, thus the insurgency underestimated the military strength of the government.{{sfn|Aguilera Peralta|1981|p=}} The insurgency subsequently found itself overwhelmed, and was unable to secure its advances and protect the indigenous civilian population from reprisals by the security forces.\n\n===='Operation Ceniza'====\n\nIn response to the guerilla offensive in early 1981, the Guatemalan Army began mobilizing for a large-scale rural counter-offensive. The Lucas government instituted a policy of forced recruitment and began organizing a \"task-force\" model for fighting the insurgency, by which strategic mobile forces were drawn from larger military brigades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ciidh/qr/english/chap4.html|title=State Violence in Guatemala, 1960 \u2013 1996: A Quantitative Reflection}}</ref> To curtail civilian participation in the insurgency and provide greater distinction between \"hostile\" and compliant communities in the countryside, the army resorted to a series of \"civic action\" measures. The army under Chief of Staff Benedicto Lucas Garc\u00eda (the President's brother) began to search out communities in which to organize and recruit civilians into pro-government [[paramilitary]] patrols, who would combat the insurgents and kill their collaborators.\n\nIn 1980, and 1981, the United States under [[Reagan administration]] delivered $10.5&nbsp;million worth of [[Bell 212]] and [[Bell 412]] helicopters and $3.2&nbsp;million worth of military trucks and jeeps to the Guatemalan Army.{{sfn|North American Congress on Latin America|1984|p=132}} In 1981, the Reagan administration also approved a $2&nbsp;million covert CIA program for Guatemala.{{sfn|North American Congress on Latin America|1984|p=48}}\n\nOn 15 April 1981, EGP rebels attacked a Guatemalan Army patrol from the village of Cocob near Nebaj, killing five personnel. On 17 April 1981, a reinforced company of Airborne troops was deployed to the village. They discovered fox holes, guerrillas and a hostile population. The local people appeared to fully support the guerrillas. \"The soldiers were forced to fire at anything that moved.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Guatemalan Soldiers Kill Civilians in Cocob|date=April 1981|publisher=CIA Secret Cable|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB11/docs/doc12.pdf}}</ref> The army killed 65 civilians, including 34 children, five adolescents, 23 adults and two elderly people.<ref>CEH, 1998, p. 51</ref>\n\nIn July 1981, the armed forces initiated a new phase of counterinsurgency operations under the code-name \"''Operaci\u00f3n Ceniza,''\" or \"Operation Ashes,\" which lasted through March 1982. The purpose of the operation was to \"separate and isolate the insurgents from the civilian population.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Schirmer|first=Jennifer G.|title=The Guatemalan Military Project: A Violence Called Democracy|year=1998|page=45}}</ref> During \"''Operaci\u00f3n Ceniza''\" some 15,000 troops were deployed  on a gradual sweep through the predominantly indigenous Altiplano region, comprising the departments of [[El Quich\u00e9]] and [[Huehuetenango]].<ref>Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo (1996), ''Draining the Sea: An Analysis of Terror in Three Rural Communities in Guatemala (1980\u20131984),'' p. 42</ref>\n\nLarge numbers of civilians were killed or displaced in the Guatemalan military's counterinsurgency operations. To alienate the insurgents from their civilian base, the army carried out large-scale mass killing of unarmed civilians, burned villages and crops, and butchered animals, destroying survivors' means of livelihood. Sources with the human rights office of the Catholic Church estimated the death toll from the counterinsurgency in 1981 at 11,000, with most of the victims [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] peasants of the Guatemalan highlands.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Minority Rights Group International|journal=Minority Rights Group International Report|year=1994|issue= 94\u201395|page=1981}}</ref> Other sources and observers put the death toll due to government repression in 1981 at between 9,000 and 13,500.{{sfn|Handy|1994|p=180}}\n\nAs army repression intensified in the countryside, relations between the Guatemalan military establishment and the Lucas Garcia regime worsened. Professionals within the Guatemalan military considered the Lucas approach counterproductive, on grounds that the Lucas government's strategy of military action and systematic terror overlooked the social and ideological causes of the insurgency while radicalizing the civilian population. Additionally, Lucas went against the military's interests by endorsing his defense minister, [[Angel Anibal Guevara]], as a candidate in the March 1982 presidential elections.{{sfn|McCleary|1999|p=47}}\n\nThe guerrilla organizations in 1982 combined to form the [[Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity]] (URNG). At the same time, extreme right-wing groups of self-appointed vigilantes, including the Secret Anti-Communist Army (ESA) and the White Hand (''La Mano Blanca''), tortured and murdered students, professionals, and peasants suspected of involvement in leftist activities.\n\nOn 23 March 1982, army troops commanded by junior officers staged a coup d'\u00e9tat to prevent the assumption of power by General [[\u00c1ngel An\u00edbal Guevara]], the hand-picked candidate of outgoing President and General [[Romeo Lucas Garc\u00eda]]. They denounced Guevara's electoral victory as fraudulent. The coup leaders asked retired Gen. [[Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt]] to negotiate the departure of Lucas Guevara. R\u00edos Montt had been the candidate of the [[Guatemalan Christian Democracy|Christian Democracy Party]] in the [[Guatemalan general election, 1974|1974 presidential election]] and was widely regarded as having been denied his own victory through fraud.\n\nR\u00edos Montt was by this time a lay pastor in the evangelical Protestant [[Church of the Word]]. In his inaugural address, he stated that his presidency resulted from the will of [[God]]. He was widely perceived as having strong backing from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration in the United States. He formed a three-member [[Military dictatorship|military junta]] that annulled the 1965 constitution, dissolved [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]], suspended political parties and canceled the electoral law. After a few months, R\u00edos Montt dismissed his junta colleagues and assumed the ''de facto'' title of \"President of the Republic\".\n\nGuerrilla forces and their leftist allies denounced R\u00edos Montt, who sought to defeat them by a combination of military actions and economic reforms; in his words, \"rifles and beans\". In May 1982, the Conference of Catholic Bishops accused R\u00edos Montt of responsibility for growing militarization of the country and for continuing military massacres of civilians. An army officer was quoted in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of 18 July 1982 as telling an audience of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous Guatemalans]] in [[Cun\u00e9n]] that: \"If you are with us, we'll feed you; if not, we'll kill you.\"<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">Raymond Bonner, \"Guatemala Enlists Religion in Battle\", ''New York Times,'' 18 July 1982. For a number of years, the U.S. State Department, in its background notes on Guatemala, attributed this quotation to Gen. R\u00edos Montt. See: [https://web.archive.org/web/20020404034633/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2045.htm Background Note: Guatemala, April 2001] via the [[Internet Archive]].</ref>\nThe [[Plan de S\u00e1nchez]] massacre occurred on the same day.\n\nThe government began to form local civilian defense patrols (PACs). Participation was in theory voluntary, but in practice, many rural Guatemalan men (including young boys and the elderly), especially in the northwest, had no choice but to join either the PACs or be considered guerrillas. At their peak, the PACs are estimated to have included 1&nbsp;million conscripts. R\u00edos Montt's conscript army and PACs recaptured essentially all guerrilla territory. The insurgents' activity lessened and was largely limited to hit-and-run operations. R\u00edos Montt won this partial victory at an enormous cost in civilian deaths.\n\nR\u00edos Montt's brief presidency was probably the most violent period of the 36-year internal conflict, which resulted in thousands of deaths of mostly unarmed indigenous civilians. Although leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads also engaged in summary executions, forced disappearances, and torture of noncombatants, the vast majority of human rights violations were carried out by the Guatemalan military and the PACs they controlled. The internal conflict is described in great detail in the reports of the [[Historical Clarification Commission]] (CEH) and the Archbishop's Office for Human Rights (ODHAG). The CEH estimates that government forces were responsible for 93% of the violations; ODHAG earlier estimated that government forces were responsible for 80%.\n\nOn 8 August 1983, R\u00edos Montt was deposed by his Minister of Defense, General [[\u00d3scar Humberto Mej\u00eda V\u00edctores]], who succeeded him as ''de facto'' president of Guatemala. Mej\u00eda justified his coup, based on problems with \"religious fanatics\" in government and \"official corruption\". Seven people were killed in the coup. R\u00edos Montt survived to found a political party (the [[Guatemalan Republic Front]]) and to be elected President of Congress in 1995 and again in 2000.\n\nAwareness in the United States of the conflict in Guatemala, and its ethnic dimension, increased with the 1983 publication of the \"testimonial\" account ''I, Rigoberta Mench\u00fa'', a memoir by a leading activist. [[Rigoberta Mench\u00fa]] was awarded the 1992 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her work in favor of broader social justice. In 1998, a book by U.S. anthropologist [[David Stoll]] challenged some of the details in Mench\u00fa's book, creating an international controversy. After the publication of Stoll's book, the Nobel Committee reiterated that it had awarded the Peace Prize based on Mench\u00fa's uncontested work promoting human rights and the peace process.\n\nGeneral Mej\u00eda allowed a managed return to democracy in Guatemala, starting with a 1 July 1984 election for a [[Constituent Assembly]] to draft a democratic constitution. On 30 May 1985, after nine months of debate, the Constituent Assembly finished drafting [[Constitution of Guatemala|a new constitution]], which took effect immediately. [[Vinicio Cerezo]], a civilian politician and the presidential candidate of the [[Guatemalan Christian Democracy|Christian Democracy Party]], won the first election held under the new constitution with almost 70% of the vote, and took office on 14 January 1986.\n\n===1986 to 1996: from constitution to peace accords===\nUpon its inauguration in January 1986, President Cerezo's civilian government announced that its top priorities would be to end the political violence and establish the rule of law. Reforms included new laws of [[habeas corpus]] and ''[[amparo (law)|amparo]]'' (court-ordered protection), the creation of a legislative human rights committee, and the establishment in 1987 of the Office of Human Rights Ombudsman. The Supreme Court embarked on a series of reforms to fight corruption and improve legal system efficiency.\n\nWith Cerezo's election, the military returned to the more traditional role of providing internal security, specifically by fighting armed insurgents. The first two years of Cerezo's administration were characterized by a stable economy and a marked decrease in political violence. Dissatisfied military personnel made two coup attempts in May 1988 and May 1989, but the military leadership supported the constitutional order. The government was strongly criticized for its reluctance to investigate or prosecute cases of human rights violations.\n\nThe final two years of Cerezo's government were marked by a failing economy, strikes, protest marches, and allegations of widespread corruption. The government's inability to deal with many of the nation's social and health problems \u2014 such as infant mortality, illiteracy, deficient health and social services, and rising levels of violence \u2014 contributed to popular discontent.\n\nPresidential and congressional elections were held on 11 November 1990. After a runoff ballot, [[Jorge Antonio Serrano El\u00edas]] was inaugurated on 14 January 1991, completing the first successful transition from one democratically elected civilian government to another. Because his [[Movement of Solidarity Action]] (MAS) Party gained only 18 of 116 seats in [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]], Serrano entered into a tenuous coalition with the Christian Democrats and the National Union of the Center (UCN) to form a government.\n\nThe Serrano administration's record was mixed. It had some success in consolidating [[civilian control of the military|civilian control]] over the army, replacing a number of senior officers and persuading the military to participate in peace talks with the URNG. He took the politically unpopular step of recognizing the sovereignty of [[Belize]], which had long been officially, though fruitlessly, claimed as a province by Guatemala. The Serrano government reversed the economic slide it inherited, reducing inflation and boosting real growth.\n\nIn 1992, [[Efra\u00edn B\u00e1maca]], a notable guerrilla leader also known as [[Comandante Everardo]], \"disappeared.\" It was later found that B\u00e1maca was tortured and killed that year by Guatemalan Army officers. His widow, the American Jennifer Harbury, and members of the [[Guatemala Human Rights Commission]], based in Washington, DC, raised protests that ultimately led the United States to declassify documents going back to 1954 related to its actions in Guatemala. It was learned that the CIA had been funding the military, although Congress had prohibited such funding since 1990 because of the Army's human rights abuses. Congress forced the CIA to end its aid to the Guatemalan Army.\n\nOn 25 May 1993, Serrano illegally dissolved Congress and the Supreme Court and tried to restrict civil freedoms, allegedly to fight corruption. The ''[[autogolpe]]'' (palace coup) failed due to unified, strong protests by most elements of Guatemalan society, international pressure, and the army's enforcement of the decisions of the Court of Constitutionality, which ruled against the attempted takeover. In the face of this pressure, Serrano fled the country.\n\nOn 5 June 1993, Congress, pursuant to the 1985 constitution, elected the Human Rights Ombudsman, [[Ramiro de Le\u00f3n Carpio]], to complete Serrano's presidential term. De Le\u00f3n was not a member of any political party. Lacking a political base but with strong popular support, he launched an ambitious anti-corruption campaign to \"purify\" Congress and the Supreme Court, demanding the resignations of all members of the two bodies.\n\nDespite considerable congressional resistance, presidential and popular pressure led to a November 1993 agreement brokered by the Catholic Church between the administration and Congress. This package of constitutional reforms was approved by popular referendum on 30 January 1994. In August 1994, a new Congress was elected to complete the unexpired term. Controlled by the anti-corruption parties: the populist [[Guatemalan Republican Front]] (FRG) headed by R\u00edos Montt, and the center-right [[National Advancement Party]] (PAN), the new Congress began to abandon the corruption that characterized its predecessors.\n\nUnder de Le\u00f3n, the peace process, now brokered by the United Nations, took on new life. The government and the URNG signed agreements on human rights (March 1994), resettlement of displaced persons (June 1994), historical clarification (June 1994), and indigenous rights (March 1995). They also made significant progress on a socioeconomic and agrarian agreement.\n\nNational elections for president, Congress, and municipal offices were held in November 1995. With almost 20 parties competing in the first round, the presidential election came down to a 7 January 1996 runoff in which PAN candidate [[\u00c1lvaro Arz\u00fa|\u00c1lvaro Arz\u00fa Irigoyen]] defeated [[Alfonso Portillo Cabrera]] of the FRG by just over 2% of the vote. Arz\u00fa won because of his strength in Guatemala City, where he had previously served as mayor, and in the surrounding urban area. Portillo won all of the rural departments except Pet\u00e9n. Under the Arz\u00fa administration, peace negotiations were concluded, and the government signed peace accords ending the 36-year internal conflict in December 1996. (See section on peace process)\n\n==1996 Peace Accords to present==\nThe human rights situation remained difficult during Arz\u00fa's tenure, although some initial steps were taken to reduce the influence of the military in national affairs. The most notable human rights case of this period was the brutal slaying of Bishop [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Gerardi]] on 24 April 1998, two days after he had publicly presented a major Catholic Church-sponsored human rights report known as ''[[Guatemala: Nunca Mas]]'', summarizing testimony about human rights abuses during the Civil War. It was prepared by the Recovery of Historical Memory project, known by the acronym of [[REMHI]].<ref name=\"goldmanreview\">{{citation|title=Review of ''The Art of Political Murder: Who Killed Bishop Gerardi?'', by Francisco Goldman|last=Stanford |first=Peter | date=16 March 2008|newspaper=The Independent | url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-art-of-political-murder-who-killed-bishop-gerardi-by-francisco-goldman-795533.html |accessdate=10 April 2008 |location=London}}</ref> In 2001, three Army officers were convicted in civil court and sentenced to lengthy prison terms for his murder.<ref name=\"goldmanreview\"/>\n\nGuatemala held presidential, legislative, and municipal elections on 7 November 1999, and a runoff presidential election on 26 December. [[Alfonso Portillo]] was criticized during the campaign for his relationship with the FRG's chairman, former president [[R\u00edos Montt]]. Many charge that some of the worst human rights violations of the internal conflict were committed under R\u00edos Montt's rule.\n\nIn the first round the [[Guatemalan Republican Front]] (FRG) won 63 of 113 legislative seats, while the [[National Advancement Party]] (PAN) won 37. The New Nation Alliance (ANN) won nine legislative seats, and three minority parties won the remaining four. In the runoff on 26 December, [[Alfonso Portillo]] (FRG) won 68% of the vote to 32% for [[\u00d3scar Berger]] (PAN). Portillo carried all 22 departments and Guatemala City, which was considered the PAN's stronghold.\n\nPortillo's impressive electoral triumph, with two-thirds of the vote in the second round, gave him a mandate from the people to carry out his reform program. He pledged to maintain strong ties to the [[United States]], enhance Guatemala's growing cooperation with [[Mexico]], and join in the integration process in Central America and the Western Hemisphere. Domestically, he vowed to support continued liberalization of the economy, increase investment in human capital and infrastructure, establish an independent central bank, and increase revenue by stricter enforcement of tax collections rather than increasing taxation.\n\nPortillo also promised to continue the peace process, appoint a civilian defense minister, reform the armed forces, replace the military presidential security service with a civilian one, and strengthen protection of [[human rights]]. He appointed a pluralist cabinet, including [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] members and individuals who were independent of the FRG ruling party.\n\nProgress in carrying out Portillo's reform agenda during his first year in office was slow. As a result, public support for the government sank to nearly record lows by early 2001. The administration made progress on such issues as taking state responsibility for past human rights cases and supporting human rights in international fora. It struggled to prosecute past human rights cases, and to achieve military reforms or a fiscal pact to help finance programs to implement peace. It is seeking legislation to increase political participation by residents.\nThe prosecution by Portillo's government of suspects in Bishop Gerardi's murder set a precedent in 2001; it was the first time military officers in Guatemala had been tried in civil courts.<ref name=\"goldmanreview\"/>\n\nFaced with a high crime rate, a public corruption problem, often violent harassment and intimidation by unknown assailants of human rights activists, judicial workers, journalists, and witnesses in human rights trials, the government began serious attempts in 2001 to open a national dialogue to discuss the considerable challenges facing the country.\n\nIn July 2003, the [[Jueves Negro]] demonstrations rocked the capital, forcing the closing of the US embassy and the UN mission. Supporters of R\u00edos Montt called for his return to power, demanding that the courts lift a ban against former coup leaders participating in government. They wanted R\u00edos Montt to run as a presidential candidate in the 2003 elections. The FRG fed the demonstrators.\n\nOn 9 November 2003, [[\u00d3scar Berger]], a former mayor of Guatemala city, won the presidential election with 38.8% of the vote. As he failed to achieve a fifty percent majority, he had to go through a runoff election on 28 December, which he also won. He defeated the center-left candidate [[\u00c1lvaro Colom]]. Allowed to run, R\u00edos Montt trailed a distant third with 11% of the vote.\n\nIn early October 2005, Guatemala was devastated by [[Hurricane Stan]]. Although a relatively weak storm, it triggered a flooding disaster, resulting in at least 1,500 people dead and thousands homeless.\n\nDetermined to make progress against crime and internal police corruption, \u00d3scar Berger in December 2006 came to agreement with the [[United Nations]] to gain support for judicial enforcement of its laws. They created the [[International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala]] (CICIG), an independent institution, which is to assist the Office of the Prosecutor of Guatemala, the National Police Force, and other investigative institutions. Their goal was to prosecute cells linked to organised crime and to drug trafficking. CICIG has the authority to conduct its own inquiries, and to refer the most significant cases to the national judiciary. The stated objective of CICIG is to \"reinforce the national criminal justice system and to help it with its reforms.\"<ref name=\"cicig\">[http://www.trial-ch.org/guatemala-en/accountability.html \"Guatemala: The Need for Accountability\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904140354/http://www.trial-ch.org/guatemala-en/accountability.html |date=4 September 2012 }}, TRIAL, 2010, accessed 13 June 2013.</ref>\n\n{{as of|2010}}, CICIG has led inquiries into some 20 cases. It is acting as Deputy Prosecutor in eight other cases. CICIG conducted the investigations leading to an arrest warrant against [[Erwin Sperisen]], former Head of the National Civilian Police (Policia Nacional Civil \u2013 PNC) from 2004 to 2007. With dual Swiss-Guatemalan citizenship, he fled to Switzerland to escape prosecution in Guatemala for numerous extrajudicial killings and police corruption. In addition, 17 other persons are covered by arrest warrants related to these crimes, including several former highly placed political figures of Guatemala.<ref name=\"cicig\"/>\n\n===President Otto P\u00e9rez Molina government and \"La L\u00ednea\" case===\n{{Main|Otto P\u00e9rez Molina}}\n\nRetired general [[Otto P\u00e9rez Molina]] was elected president along with Roxana Baldetti, the first ever woman vice president in Guatemala; the began their tem in office on 14 January 2012.

Within days, over 10,000 people said they would attend. Quickly the organisers realised that for the action to succeed, they had to guarantee that no one would be harmed and The group set a series of rules making clear that no political party or group was behind that event, instructing protesters to follow the law, and urging people to bring water, food and sunblock but not cover their faces or wear party political colors.<ref name=ollantay21mayo>{{cite news|last=Itzamn\u00e1|first=Ollantay|title=Guatemala: Ind\u00edgenas y campesinos indignados exigen la renuncia del Gobierno y plantean un proceso de Asamblea Constituyente popular|url=http://www.albedrio.org/htm/articulos/o/oitzamna-070.html|date=21 May 2015|accessdate=21 May 2015|location=Guatemala|newspaper=Albedr\u00edo|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521205503/http://www.albedrio.org/htm/articulos/o/oitzamna-070.html|archivedate=21 May 2015|language=es|ref=harv}}</ref> Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Guatemala City, and due to the pressure, Baldetti resigned a few days later and was forced to remain in the country after the United States removed her visa to visit that country and the Guatemalan government arraigned her as there was enough suspicion to assume that she might be involved in \"La Linea\" scandal. This, and the prominent presence of US Ambassador Todd Robinson in the Guatemalan political scene since the scandal broke loose brought up the suspicion in Guatemalans that the US government was behind the investigation because it needed a government sympathetic to the US in Guatemala to counter the presence of China and Russia in the region.<ref name=porras2015>{{cite news|last=Porras Castej\u00f3n|first=Gustavo|title=Los Estados Unidos y su nueva forma de colonialismo en la que no hay necesidad de tropas|url=http://www.plazapublica.com.gt/content/eeuu-y-su-nueva-forma-de-colonialismo-en-la-que-no-hay-necesidad-de-tropas|newspaper=Plaza P\u00fablica|location=Guatemala|date=19 June 2015|accessdate=19 June 2015|language=es|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nSince then, the UN anti-corruption committee has reported on other cases and more than 20 government officials have stepped down, some have been arrested.

Baldiz\u00f3n popularity suffered a steep decline and he even went on to accuse CICIG leader, Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, of international obstruction with Guatemalan internal affairs before the Organization of American States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://elperiodico.com.gt/2015/07/29/pais/cicig-si-pero-sin-velasquez-dice-baldizon/ |title=CICIG s\u00ed, pero sin Vel\u00e1squez, dice Baldiz\u00f3n |newspaper=ElPeri\u00f3dico |location=Guatemala |date=29 July 2015 |accessdate=29 July 2015 |language=es |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729150940/http://elperiodico.com.gt/2015/07/29/pais/cicig-si-pero-sin-velasquez-dice-baldizon/ |archivedate=29 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nCICIG presented so many cases on Thursdays that Guatemalans started calling them \"CICIG's Thursdays\". But it was a Friday press conference that brought up the crisis to its peak:  on Friday 21 August 2015, CICIG and the Attorney General, Thelma Aldana, presented an investigation showing enough evidence to believe that both President P\u00e9rez Molina and former vice President Baldetti were the actual leaders of \"La L\u00ednea\". Baldetti was arrested that same day and an impeachment was requested for the president. As a result, several cabinet members resigned, and the clamor for the president's resignation grew to unprecedented levels after President Perez Molina defiantly assured the nation that he was not going to resign on a televised message transmitted on 23 August 2015.<ref name=periodico21a>{{cite news|url=http://elperiodico.com.gt/2015/08/21/pais/exvicepresidenta-baldetti-capturada-esta-manana-por-tres-delitos/ |title=Ex vicepresidenta Baldetti capturada esta ma\u00f1ana por tres delitos |newspaper=ElPeri\u00f3dico |location=Guatemala |date=21 August 2015 |accessdate=21 August 2015 |language=es |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821155710/http://elperiodico.com.gt/2015/08/21/pais/exvicepresidenta-baldetti-capturada-esta-manana-por-tres-delitos/ |archivedate=21 August 2015 }}</ref><ref name=eu23a>{{cite news|url=http://noticias.emisorasunidas.com/noticias/nacionales/no-renunciare-enfatiza-presidente-perez-molina |title=No renunciar\u00e9, enfatiza P\u00e9rez Molina |newspaper=Emisoras Unidas |location=Guatemala |date=23 August 2015 |accessdate=23 August 2015 |language=es |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824035254/http://noticias.emisorasunidas.com/noticias/nacionales/no-renunciare-enfatiza-presidente-perez-molina |archivedate=24 August 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAfter a thousands of protesters took to the streets to demand the increasingly isolated president's resignation, Guatemala's Congress named a commission of five legislators to consider whether to remove the president's immunity from prosecution. The request was approved by the supreme court. A major day of action kicked off early on Thursday 27 August, with marches and roadblocks across the country. Urban groups, which have spearheaded regular protests since the scandal broke in April, on Thursday 27th sought to unite with rural and indigenous organizations who have orchestrated the road blocks.\n\nThis strike in Guatemala City was filled to bursting with a diverse and peaceful crowd ranging from the indigenous poor to the well-healed, and included many students from public and private universities. Hundreds of schools and businesses closed in support of the protests. The organization grouping Guatemala's most powerful business leaders issued a statement demanding that P\u00e9rez Molina step down, and urged Congress to withdraw his immunity from prosecution.\n\nThe attorney general's office released its own statement calling on the president to resign, \"to prevent ungovernability that could destabilize the nation.\" As pressure mounted, the president's former ministers of defence and the interior, who were named in the corruption investigation and resigned from cabinet recently, left the country.<ref name=lopez27a>{{cite news|url=http://elperiodico.com.gt/2015/08/27/pais/vuelan-dos-exministros-lopez-ambrosio-ayer-a-panama-y-lopez-bonilla-hoy-hacia-la-dominicana/ |title=Vuelan dos exministros: Lopez Ambrosio ayer a Panam\u00e1 y L\u00f3pez Bonilla hoy hacia la Dominicana |newspaper=ElPeri\u00f3dico |location=Guatemala |date=27 August 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015 |language=es |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827162655/http://elperiodico.com.gt/2015/08/27/pais/vuelan-dos-exministros-lopez-ambrosio-ayer-a-panama-y-lopez-bonilla-hoy-hacia-la-dominicana/ |archivedate=27 August 2015 }}</ref> P\u00e9rez Molina, meanwhile, has been losing support by the day.

framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], where by the [[President of Guatemala]] is both [[head of state]], [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[Congress of the Republic of Guatemala|Congress of the Republic]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n[[Constitution of Guatemala|Guatemala's 1985 Constitution]] provides for a separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] has rated Guatemala as \"[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|hybrid regime]]\" in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016|title=Democracy Index 2016 - The Economist Intelligence Unit|last=solutions|first=EIU digital|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe president and vice president are directly elected through [[universal suffrage]] and limited to one term. A vice president can run for president after four years out of office. In the latest elections, which took place in 2011, Retired General [[Otto P\u00e9rez Molina]] of the [[Patriotic Party]] won the presidential election in a runoff against populist [[Manuel Baldiz\u00f3n]] of the LIDER party.\n\n{{office-table}}\n|[[President of Guatemala|President]]\n|[[Jimmy Morales]]\n|[[National Convergence Front]]\n|14 January 2016\n|}\n\n==Legislative branch==\n\n[[File:El Congreso de la Rep\u00fablica.JPG|thumb|The [[Congress of the Republic of Guatemala|Guatemalan Congress]].]]\nThe [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress of the Republic]] ''(Congreso de la Rep\u00fablica)'' has 158 members, elected for a four-year term, partially in departmental [[constituency|constituencies]] and partially by nationwide [[proportional representation]].\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{See|List of political parties in Guatemala|Elections in Guatemala}}\n\nPolitical parties in Guatemala are generally numerous and unstable. No party has won the presidency more than once and in every election period the majority of the parties are small and newly formed. Even the longer-lived parties, such as the [[Guatemalan Christian Democracy|Christian Democrats]] (DCG) or the [[Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity|URNG]], tend to last less than a decade as significant forces in Guatemalan politics.\n\n{{Guatemalan presidential election, 2007}}\n{{Guatemalan parliamentary election, 2007}}\n\n==Judicial branch==\nThe Constitutional Court ''(Corte de Constitucionalidad)'' is Guatemala's constitutional court and only interprets the law in matters that affect the country's constitution. It is composed of five judges, elected for concurrent five-year terms each with a supplement, each serving one year as president of the Court: one is elected by Congress, one elected by the Supreme Court of Justice, one is appointed by the President, one is elected by Superior Council of the [[Universidad San Carlos de Guatemala]], and one by the Bar Association ''(Colegio de Abogados);'' <ref>http://www.cc.gob.gt/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=55</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court of Justice ''(Corte Suprema de Justicia)'' is Guatemala's highest court. It comprises thirteen members, who serve concurrent five-year terms and elect a president of the Court each year from among their number. The president of the Supreme Court of Justice also supervises trial judges around the country, who are named to five-year terms). The Supreme Court has an Appeal Court formed by 43 members. When one of the Supreme Court is absent or cannot participates in a case, one of the Appeal Court takes its place.<ref>http://www.oj.gob.gt/index.php/csj</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{Main|Departments of Guatemala}}\n\nGuatemala is [[Departments of Guatemala|divided into 22 departments]], administered by governors appointed by the president. [[Guatemala City]] and 333 other municipalities are governed by popularly elected mayors or councils.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n{{See|Foreign relations of Guatemala}}\n\nGuatemala's major diplomatic interests are regional security and increasingly, regional development and economic integration.\n\n==Political culture and human rights==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2010}}\nThe 1999 presidential and legislative elections were considered by international observers to have been free and fair. Participation by women and indigenous voters was higher than in the recent past, although concerns remained regarding the accessibility of polling places in rural areas.\n\n[[Alfonso Antonio Portillo Cabrera|Alfonso Portillo]]'s landslide victory combined with a [[Guatemalan Republican Front]] (FRG) majority in Congress suggested possibilities for rapid legislative action. However, under the Guatemalan Constitution of 1985, passage of many kinds of legislation requires a two-thirds vote. Passage of such legislation is not possible, therefore, with FRG votes alone.\n\nThe political balance was disrupted in 2000 when allegations surfaced that the FRG had illegally altered legislation. Following an investigation, the Supreme Court stripped those involved, including President of Congress and FRG chief [[Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt|R\u00edos Montt]], of their legislative immunity to face charges in the case. At roughly the same time, the PAN opposition suffered an internal split and broke into factions; the same occurred in the ANN. As a result, reforms essential to peace implementation await legislative action.\n\nNew cases of [[human rights]] abuse continued to decline, although violent harassment of human rights workers presented a serious challenge to government authority. Common crime, aggravated by a legacy of violence and vigilante justice, presents another serious challenge. Impunity remains a major problem, primarily because democratic institutions, including those responsible for the administration of justice, have developed only a limited capacity to cope with this legacy. The government has stated it will require until 2002 to meet the target of increasing its tax burden (at about 10% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], currently the lowest in the region) to 12% of GDP.\n\nDuring the Presidential race, the FRG organized what will later be known as Black Thursday ([[Jueves negro]]). The FRG organized its partisans from the country and brought them to the city. The FRG gave them transport, food, a shelter for the night, and meter long sticks. With these sticks, the participants ran through the streets wreaking havoc on the public infrastructure. During this day a journalist of [[Prensa Libre]] (a leading newspaper) was killed.\n\nThe media, which have a tradition of being independent and free, took it very personally and for the next month, every headline was about these events, and the participation of the ruling party in this day of terror. The FRG was protesting the ruling of the TSE (supreme electoral tribunal) to ban the FRG candidate Efrain Rios Mont from the race. The TSE argued that as a formal putschist, he was banned by the constitution from ever becoming president. The FRG argued that since the events in which the former general participated predate the constitution, he was eligible for presidential office. Common sense argued that if such a clause was not retroactive by nature it would have no point.\n\nSince 2004 [[\u00d3scar Berger]] of the GANA (a [[Electoral coalition|coalition of political parties]] rather than a single one) won the elections, it is important to note that this was the first government in the history of democratic Guatemala that did not have an overwhelming majority in Congress. After he took office in January 2004 it was made public that the FRG had wildly ransacked the government going to the extremes of stealing computer equipment and objects of historic importance. Alfonso Portillo fled to Mexico with an impressive amount of money stolen from military funds, the national hospital, and the revenue service. Guatemala made a formal request for the deportation of Portillo to face charges of embezzlement, however, Mexico has never revoked diplomatic asylum once it is granted to a person.\n\nThough the constitution says nothing about it, the vice president runs the government like a prime minister while the president deals with foreign affairs, this can be seen regularly as the VP stands in for the president in many events that are traditionally presided by the President of the Republic.\n\nCriminality has reached staggering proportions: about 200 murders per month and it is starting to affect the economy as many companies prefer to leave the country than face the growing corruption and insecurity. One significant problem is the ongoing gang warfare between the M18 ([[18th Street gang|Mara Dieciocho]]) and the MS ([[Mara Salvatrucha]]). These are two rival street gangs comprising loosely linked international franchise organizations, who wield a power somewhat like that of the US mafia of the 1930s and are for the moment above and beyond the grasp of the law. They hold territory under their control and extort \"taxes\" (la renta) from it.\n\nThey are not yet involved in high-level organized trafficking. That industry is of a different class of organized crime in Guatemala, with Mexican smugglers and top-ranking Guatemalan police officials regularly making headlines being caught with hundreds of kilograms of cocaine.\n\nThe mara phenomenon originated in the United States in the 1980s, specifically in Los Angeles, among refugees fleeing civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala. Later many members of the maras were deported from the United States to their countries of origin, and during the 1990s this has helped fuel the spread of the two gangs across the United States, Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and even Italy and Spain. There is a zone of Guatemala City, \"El Gallito\" which is recognized as being outside of Government control, it belongs to the drug lords that inhabit it. Barrio \"El Gallito\" is located in Zone 3, 2 miles away from the National Palace where the Government's offices are located.\n\nDrug trafficking has reached staggering proportions in Guatemala, with corruption extending to top positions of many branches of government. Various narco-mafias vie for control of the remote northern jungle regions of [[Pet\u00e9n Department|Pet\u00e9n]], where drugs, arms, and people all cross the border into Mexico, mostly bound for the United States. Drug trafficking is undoubtedly the greatest threat to political freedom in Guatemala today.\n\nGuatemala is plagued by lynchings which severely blemish the country's humans rights record as a violation of due process of law.\n\nThe Berger administration has been hailed in some circles for its work in devolution. Guatemala has always been a strongly centralized state and the administration sought to take halt the growing pre-eminence of the Capital. For example, the administration has engaged in mobile cabinets where the President and all his ministers will go into the country and change the seat of power every so often, to be \"closer to the people\".\n\nThe administration is facing growing financial difficulties, potentially in part due to 60% of the population being considered \"poor\" and therefore ineligible for taxation. The SAT (superintendence of tributary administration), the revenue service, is therefore obligated to tax the middle class which is starting to suffer under the burden. The SAT has become stringent in its application of the law seeking the full penalties of incarceration for tax evasion.\n\nIn September 2006 the PNC (civil national police), in a joint action with the national military took by storm the Pavon detention centre, a prison with 1,500 inmates which until that date hadn't been requisitioned for 10 years and which was a hub of criminal activity. Some inmates, the guard of the chief of the mafioso what ran the prison and the leader himself resisted the onslaught of forces of law with [[AK-47]] and handguns, they were massacred. Around 3,000 infantry and 4 tanks participated in the action. This was a milestone in the history of Guatemala and made national headlines.\n\n2006 saw the dismemberment of the GANA in the face of the 2007 elections. It fractured into many parties, damaging the ability of the government to get legislation through Congress.\n\nIn the November 2007, second round presidential elections, [[\u00c1lvaro Colom]] of the UNE was elected president, defeating ex-general Otto Perez Molina of the PP. And in 2011, Retired General [[Otto P\u00e9rez Molina]] of the [[Patriotic Party]] won the presidential election in a runoff against populist [[Manuel Baldiz\u00f3n]] of the LIDER party. P\u00e9rez Molina assumed office on January 14, 2012, and his vice president is [[Roxana Baldetti]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Central American Parliament]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2010}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.congreso.gob.gt/ Congresso of the Republic of Guatemala]\n*[http://www.oj.gob.gt/ Justice of Guatemala]\n\n<br>\n{{Guatemala topics}}\n{{Americas topic|Politics of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Politics Of Guatemala}}\n[[Category:Politics of Guatemala| ]]", "sha1": "t9g8qoj12zelta1qhgk61omwrdnw7a6"}}, {"title": "Economy of Guatemala", "ns": "0", "id": "12161", "revision": {"id": "859149470", "parentid": "859149400", "timestamp": "2018-09-12T01:58:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "Mikeblas", "id": "327592"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Economic priorities */ remove red link", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}{{Infobox economy\n|country         = Guatemala\n|image           = ZONAPRADERA.JPG\n|width           = 270\n|caption         = [[Guatemala City|Guatemala City Financial District]]\n|currency        = [[Quetzal (currency)|Quetzal]]\n|year            = Calendar year\n|gdp rank        = 81st (2015, PPP)\n|gdp             = $125.9 billion (2012, PPP)\n|growth          = 4.1% (2015), 3.1% (2016), <br> 2.8% (2017e), 3.1% (2018f) <ref>{{cite web|url= https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29801/9781464812576.pdf|title= World Bank forecast for Guatemala, June 2018   (p. 152) |publisher=[[World Bank]]|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n|per capita      = US$7,700 (2015 est.)\n|sectors         = agriculture 13.4%, industry 23.8%, services 62.7% (2015 est.)\n|inflation       = 2.4% (2015 est.)\n|poverty         = 54% (2011)\n|gini            = 54.1 (2006)\n|edbr            = 88th (2017)<ref name=\" World Bank and International Financial Corporation \">{{cite web |url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/guatemala |title=Ease of Doing Business in Guatemala |publisher=Doingbusiness.org |accessdate=2017-01-25 }}</ref>\n|unemployment    = 2.9% (2012)<ref name=\"World Data Bank\">{{cite web|title=World DataBank|url=http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/reports/tableview.aspx#|publisher=The World Bank}}</ref>\n|industries      = sugar, textiles  and clothing, furniture, chemicals, petroleum, metals, rubber, tourism\n|exports         = $9.864 billion (2012 est.)\n|export-goods    = coffee, sugar, petroleum, apparel, bananas, fruits and vegetables, cardamom (2012)\n|export-partners = {{flag|United States}} 39.2% <br> {{flag|El Salvador}} 11.4% <br> {{flag|Honduras}} 6.8% <br> {{flag|Mexico}} 5.4% <br> {{flag|Nicaragua}} 4.0% (2012 est.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2050.html#gt|title=Export Partners of Guatemala|publisher=[[CIA World Factbook]]|year=2012|accessdate=2013-07-25}}</ref>\n|imports         = $15.57 billion (2012 est.)\n|import-goods    = fuels, machinery and transport equipment, construction materials, grain, fertilizers, electricity, mineral products, chemical products, plastic materials and products\n|import-partners = {{flag|United States}} 38.4% <br> {{flag|Mexico}} 11.9% <br> {{flag|China}} 8.3% <br> {{flag|El Salvador}} 5.1% <br> {{flag|Colombia}} 4.2% (2012 est.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2061.html#gt|title=Import Partners of Guatemala|publisher=[[CIA World Factbook]]|year=2012|accessdate=2013-07-25}}</ref>\n|debt            = $16.17 billion (31 December 2012)\n|revenue         = US$5.799 billion (2012 est.)\n|expenses        = US$7.091 billion (2012 est.)\n|aid             = $250 million (2000 est.)\n|credit          = [[Standard & Poor's]]:<ref>{{cite web |title= Sovereigns rating list |publisher=Standard & Poor's |url=http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/sovereigns/ratings-list/en/eu/?subSectorCode=39 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref><br>BB+ (Domestic)<br>BB (Foreign)<br>BBB- (T&C Assessment)<br>Outlook: Stable<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |title=How Fitch, Moody's and S&P rate each country's credit rating |date=15 April 2011 |first1=Simon |last1=Rogers |first2=Ami |last2=Sedghi |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/30/credit-ratings-country-fitch-moodys-standard |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref><br>[[Moody's]]:<ref name=guardian/><br>Ba1<br>Outlook: Stable<br>[[Fitch Group|Fitch]]:<ref name=guardian/><br>BB+<br>Outlook: Stable\n|reserves        = US$6.187 billion (March 2011)<ref>{{cite web |title=International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity -

These inflows are a primary source of foreign income, equivalent to nearly two-thirds of exports.\n\n[[Guatemala]]'s [[gross domestic product]] for 1990 was estimated at $19.1 billion, with real growth slowing to approximately 3.3%. Ten years later, in 2000, it rose by 1 to 4% and by 2010 it had fallen back to 3%, according to the World Bank. The final peace accord in December 1996 left Guatemala well-positioned for rapid economic growth.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\nGuatemala's economy is dominated by the private sector, which generates about 85% of GDP.{{Citation needed|reason=Does this include the informal economy?|date=April 2011}} Most of it manufacturing is light assembly and food processing, geared to the domestic, U.S., and [[Central America]]n markets. In 1990 the labor force participation rate for women was 42%, later increasing by 1% in 2000 to 43% and 51% in 2010. For men, the labor force participation rate in 1990 was about 89%, decreased to 88% in 2000, and  increased up to 90% in 2010 (World Bank). Self-employment for men is about 50%, while the rate for women is about 32% (Pag\u00e0n 1).\n\nOver the past several years, tourism and exports of textiles, apparel, and nontraditional agricultural products such as winter vegetables, fruit, and cut [[flower]]s have boomed, while more traditional exports such as [[sugar]], [[banana]]s, and [[coffee]] continue to represent a large share of the export market.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}Over the past twenty years the percentage of exports of goods and services has fluctuated. In 1990 it was 21% and in 2000, 20%. It increased again in 2010 to 26%. On the other hand, its level of imports of goods and services has continually increased. In 1990 its imports of goods and services was about 25%. In 2000 it increased by 4% up to 29%, and in 2010 it increased up to 36%. Migration is another important avenue in Guatemala.

In fact, 13.4% of children aged 7 to 14 work; 68% of them are in the agricultural sector, 13% in the industrial sector, and 18% in the services sector.<ref>[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/guatemala.htm Guatemala, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor]</ref> The 2013 DOL report stated that \"Guatemala [...] lacks Government programs targeting sectors in which children are known to engage in exploitative labor, such as domestic service, mining, quarrying, and construction.\"\nIn December 2014, the Department's ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' included mostly agricultural goods produced in such working conditions, namely broccoli, [[Coffee production in Guatemala|coffee]], corn and [[sugarcane]]. Guatemala's firework and gravel production also resorted to [[child labor]] according to the report.\n\n==Maquilas==\n\nAmong the most important factors in Guatemala's economy are the significant number of Korean-owned [[maquila]] factories in the highlands of Guatemala. Korean entrepreneurs have adopted a buyer-driven [[commodity chain]] process that depends on the existence of a large labor force, low [[Capital (economics)|capital]] investment and low skills. Korea presents itself to Guatemalan industry and to Guatemalan workers by means of subcontractors responsible for delivering finished orders to multiple buyers, mostly located in the United States. Buyers include Macy's and JC Penny and brands such as Liz Claiborne, OshKosh and Tracy Evans.\n\nThe first industries began in 1980s. At first, workers were very interested in the new jobs in the factories, because they offered the opportunity to transition to what was seen as a new and modern world, away from agricultural work. However, in the factories, workers' backs hurt, because they sat for many hours on backless benches in front of sewing machines. Workers would usually enter the plant at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. and take a 1-hour break for lunch at noon. They were expected to work until 7:00 or 8:00pm in the evening. About 70% of the workers in macula factories were female. Years later, there was a huge [[turnover (employment)|turnover]]. Workers started to leave the macula factories for reasons like stress, bad treatment, poor payment, etc.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last1=Goldin\n|first1=Liliana\n|title=From Despair to Resistance: Maya Workers In The Maquilas Of Guatemala\n|journal=Anthropology of Work Review\n|date=December 7, 2014\n|volume=33\n|issue=1\n|pages=25\u201333\n|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1417.2012.01074.x\n}}</ref>\n\n==Economic priorities==\n{{See also|Caribbean Community}}\nCurrent economic priorities include:{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* [[liberalization|Liberalizing]] the trade regime;\n* Financial services sector reform;\n* Overhauling Guatemala's public finances;\n* Simplifying the [[tax]] structure, enhancing tax compliance, and broadening the tax base.\n* Improving the investment climate through procedural and regulatory simplification and adopting a goal of concluding treaties to protect investment and [[intellectual property]] rights.\n\nImport [[tariff]]s have been lowered in conjunction with Guatemala's Central American neighbors so that most fall between 0% and 15%, with further reductions planned. Responding to Guatemala's changed political and economic policy environment, the international community has mobilized substantial resources to support the country's economic and social development objectives. The United States, along with other donor countries\u2014especially France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Japan, and the international financial institutions\u2014have increased development project financing. Donors' response to the need for international financial support funds for implementation of the Peace Accords is, however, contingent upon Guatemalan government reforms and counterpart financing.\n\nProblems hindering economic growth include high [[crime]] rates, [[literacy|illiteracy]] and low levels of [[education]], and an inadequate and underdeveloped capital market. They also include lack of [[infrastructure]], particularly in the transportation, [[telecommunication]]s, and electricity sectors, although the state telephone company and electricity distribution were privatized in 1998. The distribution of income and wealth remains highly skewed. The wealthiest 10% of the population receives almost one-half of all income, and the top 20% receives two-thirds of all income. Approximately 29% of the population lives in [[poverty]], and 6% of that number live in extreme poverty.

In anticipation of an effort to bring the border dispute to an end in early 1996, the Guatemalan Congress ratified two long-pending international agreements governing frontier issues and maritime rights.\n\nIn early 2000 the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry proposed a border settlement that would transfer more than half of Belize's territory to Guatemala. Following a spate of border incidents, both sides agreed during talks under OAS auspices in November 2000 to [[confidence-building]] measures to reduce tensions. They followed that with an agreement on opening substantive discussions on the dispute. Both Guatemala and Belize are participating in the confidence-building measures, including the Guatemala-Belize Language Exchange Project.\n\nIn September 2010 the [[Guatemalan Congress]] overwhelmingly gave its approval for a referendum to be held to give the people of Guatemala a say in whether or not that country\u2019s claim to Belize should be taken to the [[International Court of Justice]] for final resolution. Under the special agreement ([[compromis]]) signed in December 2008 by Belize and Guatemala it was agreed that if the people of both nations approved, by way of a simultaneous referendum on the same day, that the dispute would proceed to the ICJ. The outcome of any ruling handed down by the ICJ will be final and binding, regardless of in whose favor the ruling is handed down.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Canada}}||<!--Date started-->1961||\n\n* Canada has an embassy in Guatemala City.<ref>[http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/guatemala/index.aspx?lang=eng Embassy of Canada in Guatemala]</ref>\n* Guatemala has an embassy in [[Ottawa]] and a consulate-general in [[Montreal]].<ref>[http://www.canada.minex.gob.gt/Home/Home.aspx Embassy of Guatemala in Canada]</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Republic of China}} ([[Taiwan]])||<!--Date started-->1902||\n[[File:\u8521\u82f1\u6587\u7e3d\u7d71\u63a5\u898b\u74dc\u5730\u99ac\u62c9\u99d0\u7dad\u4e5f\u7d0d\u806f\u5408\u570b\u5e38\u4efb\u4ee3\u8868\u5361\u65af\u5e1d\u8036\u8afe\u65af\u4f09\u5137.jpg|thumb|Guatemala Diplomat Antonio Roberto Castellanos Lopez and ROC President [[Tsai Ing-wen]] in [[Taiwan]].]]\nGuatemala maintains official relations with the [[Republic of China]] (ROC).\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|El Salvador}}||<!--Date started-->1821||\n\n* El Salvador has an embassy in Guatemala City.<ref>[http://embajadaguatemala.rree.gob.sv Embassy of El Salvador in Guatemala (in Spanish)]</ref>\n* Guatemala has an embassy in [[San Salvador]].<ref>[http://www.elsalvador.minex.gob.gt Embassy of Guatemala in El Salvador (in Spanish)]</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Guyana}}||<!--Date started-->1 May 1992||\n\n*Both countries established diplomatic relations on 1 May, 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minfor.gov.gy/docs/other/diplomatic_relations_list.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307101008/http://www.minfor.gov.gy/docs/other/diplomatic_relations_list.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-07 |df= }}</ref> \n*Both countries are full members of Organization of American States and [[Association of Caribbean States]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Honduras}}||<!--Date started-->1821||\n\n* Guatemala has an embassy in [[Tegucigalpa]] and a consulate in [[San Pedro Sula]].<ref>[http://www.honduras.minex.gob.gt/Home/Home.aspx Embassy of Guatemala in Honduras (in Spanish)]</ref>\n* Honduras has an embassy in Guatemala.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|India}}||<!--Date started-->16 May 1972||See [[Guatemala-India relations]]\n\n* India maintains an embassy in Guatemala City.<ref>[http://www.indemguatemala.org/ Indian Embassy in Guatemala]</ref>\n* Guatemala has an embassy in [[New Delhi]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n\n|{{flag|Israel}}||<!--Date started-->19 May 1948<ref>http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1950_14_Israel.pdf</ref>||\n[[File:Ambassador of Israel to Guatemala Joshua N Shai 1964.jpg|thumb|Dinner hosted by Israeli Ambassador to Guatemala Joshua Shai, in honor of [[President of Guatemala]] [[Enrique Peralta Azurdia]], at his residence in Guatemala, 1964.]]\n* Israel maintains an embassy in Guatemala City.<ref>http://embassies.gov.il/guatemala/Pages/default.aspx</ref>\n* Guatemala has an embassy in [[Jerusalem]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Mexico}}||<!--Date started-->1838||See [[Guatemala\u2013Mexico relations]]\n\nDiplomatic relations between Mexico and Guatemala began in 1838 after the dissolution of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].\n*Mexico has an embassy in Guatemala City and a consulate in [[Quetzaltenango]] and [[Ayutla, San Marcos|Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n]].<ref>[http://embamex.sre.gob.mx/guatemala/ Embassy of Mexico in Guatemala City (in Spanish).]</ref>\n*Guatemala has an embassy in [[Mexico City]] and consulates-general in [[Oaxaca City]], [[Tenosique]], [[Tijuana]], [[Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez]] and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz City]].

U.S. policy objectives in Guatemala include:\n* Supporting the institutionalization of [[democracy]] and implementation of the peace accords;\n* Encouraging respect for human rights and the [[rule of law]], and implementation of the [[International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala]] (CICIG);\n* Supporting broad-based economic growth and sustainable development and maintaining mutually beneficial trade and commercial relations, including ensuring that benefits of [[Dominican Republic\u2013Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA-DR) reach all sectors of the Guatemalan populace;\n* Cooperating to combat [[money laundering]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], [[narcotics trafficking]], alien-smuggling, and other transnational crime; and\n* Supporting Central American [[Regional integration|integration]] through support for resolution of border/territorial disputes.\n\nThe United States, as a member of \"the Friends of Guatemala\", along with [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]], [[Spain]], [[Norway]], and [[Venezuela]], played an important role in the UN-moderated peace accords. The United States strongly supported the six substantive and three procedural accords, which, along with the signing of the December 29, 1996 final accord, form the blueprint for profound political, economic, and social change. To that end, the U.S. government committed over $500 million to support peace implementation since 1997.\n\nViolent criminal activity continues to be a problem in Guatemala, including murder, rape, and armed assaults. In recent years the number of violent crimes reported by U.S. citizens has steadily increased, though the number of Americans traveling to Guatemala has increased.\n\nMost U.S. assistance to Guatemala is provided through the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]]'s (USAID) offices for Guatemala. USAID/Guatemala's current program builds on the gains of the peace process that followed the signing of the peace accords in December 1996, as well as on the achievements of its 1997\u20132004 peace program. The current program works to advance U.S. foreign policy objectives by focusing on Guatemala's potential as Central America's largest economy and trading partner of the United States, but also recognizes the country's lagging social indicators and widespread poverty. The three areas of focus for USAID/Guatemala's program are modeled after the Millennium Challenge Account areas\u2014ruling justly, [[economic freedom]], and investing in people.\n|}\n\n== Multilateral relations ==\nThe Central American Ministers of Trade meet on a regular basis to work on regional approaches to trade issues. In March 1998, Guatemala joined its [[Central America]]n neighbors in signing a [[Trade and Investment Framework Agreement]] (TIFA). In 2000 it joined [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]] in signing a free trade agreement with [[Mexico]], which went into effect in 2001. Guatemala also originated the idea for, and is the seat of, the [[Central American Parliament]] (PARLACEN).\n\nGuatemala participates in several regional groups, particularly those related to the environment and trade. For example, US President Clinton and the Central American presidents signed the CONCAUSA (Conjunto Centroamerica-USA) agreement at the [[Summit of the Americas]] in December 1994. CONCAUSA is a cooperative plan of action to promote clean, [[efficient energy use]]; conserve the region's biodiversity; strengthen legal and institutional frameworks and compliance mechanisms; and improve and harmonize environmental protection standards.\n\n'''Illicit drugs:'''\nGuatemala is a transit country for [[cocaine]] shipments; minor producer of illicit opium poppy and cannabis for the international [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]]; active eradication program in 1996 effectively eliminated the cannabis crop; proximity to Mexico makes Guatemala a major staging area for drugs (cocaine shipments).\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Belizean\u2013Guatemalan territorial dispute]]\n* [[List of diplomatic missions in Guatemala]]\n* [[List of diplomatic missions of Guatemala]]\n* [[Visa

It lies roughly north of [[Saint-Malo]] and to the west of [[Jersey]] and the [[Cotentin Peninsula]]. With several smaller nearby islands, it forms a jurisdiction within the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], a [[Crown dependencies|Crown dependency]]. The jurisdiction is made up of [[Parishes of Guernsey|ten parishes]] on the island of Guernsey, three other inhabited islands ([[Herm]], [[Jethou]] and [[Lihou]]), and many small islets and rocks.\n\n==Constitutional status==\nThe jurisdiction is not part of the [[United Kingdom]], although defence and most foreign relations are handled by the British Government.<ref name=\"Ogier\" />\n\nThe entire jurisdiction lies within the [[Common Travel Area]] of the [[British Isles]] and is not a member of the [[European Union]], but has a special relationship with it, being treated as part of the European Community with access to the single market for the purposes of free trade in goods.

Guernsey may not apply different immigration controls to the UK.\n\n===Housing restrictions===\nGuernsey undertakes a population management mechanism using restrictions over who may work in the island through control of which properties people may live in. The housing market is split between ''local market'' properties and a set number of ''open market'' properties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/twotierhousingmarket |title=Guernsey's Two Tier Housing Market |publisher=States of Guernsey |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419235752/http://www.gov.gg/twotierhousingmarket |archivedate=19 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Anyone may live in an open market property, but local market properties can only be lived in by those who qualify \u2013 either through being born in Guernsey (to at least one local parent), by obtaining a housing licence, or by virtue of sharing a property with someone who does qualify (living ''en famille''). Consequently, ''open market'' properties are much more expensive both to buy and to rent. Housing licences are for fixed periods, often only valid for 4 years and only as long as the individual remains employed by a specified Guernsey employer. The licence will specify the type of accommodation and be specific to the address the person lives in,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/live |title=Where can licence holders live |publisher=States of Guernsey |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501145835/http://www.gov.gg/live |archivedate=1 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and is often subject to a police record check. These restrictions apply equally regardless of whether the property is owned or rented, and only apply to occupation of the property. Thus a person whose housing licence expires may continue to own a Guernsey property, but will no longer be able to live in it. There are no restrictions on who may own a property.\n\nThere are a number of routes to qualifying as a \"local\" for housing purposes. Generally, it is sufficient to be born to at least one Guernsey parent and to live in the island for ten years in a twenty-year period. In a similar way a partner (married or otherwise) of a local can acquire local status. Multiple problems arise following early separation of couples, especially if they have young children or if a local partner dies, in these situations personal circumstances and compassion can add weight to requests for local status. Once \"local\" status has been achieved it remains in place for life. Even a lengthy period of residence outside Guernsey does not invalidate \"local\" housing status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/qualifiedresident |title=What is a Qualified Resident? |publisher=States of Guernsey |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414221632/http://www.gov.gg/qualifiedresident |archivedate=14 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Guernsey's inhabitants are full [[British nationality law|British citizens]],<ref>{{cite legislation UK | type = act | year = 1981| chapter = 61| act = British Nationality Act 1981}}</ref> an endorsement restricting the right of establishment in other European Union states is placed in the passport of British citizens connected solely with the Channel Islands and [[Isle of Man]]. If classified with \"Islander Status\", the British passport will be endorsed as follows: 'The holder is not entitled to benefit from EU provisions relating to employment or establishment'. Those who have a parent or grandparent born in the United Kingdom itself (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), or who have lived in the United Kingdom for 5 years, are not subject to this restriction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/article/2822/What-is-Islander-status |title=What is Islander status? |publisher=States of Guernsey |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007233859/http://www.gov.gg/article/2822/What-is-Islander-status |archivedate=7 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Education===\n{{See also|List of schools in Guernsey}}\n[[File:Elizabeth College Guernsey.jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth College, Guernsey|Elizabeth College]], in St Peter Port, Guernsey]]\nTeaching in Guernsey is based on the English National Curriculum.

The Department has completed the building of Le Rondin special needs school, the Sixth Form Centre at the Grammar School and the first phase of the new College of Further Education \u2013 a performing arts centre. The construction of St Sampsons High was completed summer 2008 and admitted its first pupils in September 2008.\n\nIn 2008, the school leaving age was raised so the earliest date is the last Friday in June in the year a pupil turns 16, in line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This means pupils will be between 15 and 10 months and 16 and 10 months before being able to leave. Prior to this, pupils could leave school at the end of the term in which they turned 14, if they so wished: a letter was required to be sent to the Education department to confirm this. However, this option was undertaken by relatively few pupils, the majority choosing to complete their GCSEs and then either begin employment or continue their education.\n\nPost-[[GCSE]] pupils have a choice of transferring to the state run [[Guernsey Grammar School and Sixth Form Centre|Grammar School & Sixth Form Centre]], or to the independent colleges for academic AS/A Levels/International Baccalureate Diploma Programme. They also have the option to study vocational subjects at the island's ''Guernsey College of Further Education''.\n\nThere are no universities in the island. Students who attend university in the United Kingdom receive state support towards both maintenance and tuition fees. In 2007, the Education Department received the approval of the States Assembly to introduce student contributions to the costs of higher education, in the form of student loans, as apply in the UK. However, immediately after the general election of 2008, the States Assembly voted in favour of a [[Private member's bill|Requ\u00eate]] which proposed abolishing the student loans scheme on the grounds that it was expensive to run and would potentially discourage students from going to, and then returning to the island from, university. In 2012, the Education Department reported to the States Assembly that it had no need to re-examine the basis of higher education funding at the present time.\n\n==Culture==\n\n{{main|Culture of Guernsey}}\n\n[[File:George M\u00e9tivier.jpg|thumb|left|[[George M\u00e9tivier]]]]\nEnglish is the language in general use by the majority of the population, while [[Guern\u00e9siais]], the [[Norman language]] of the island, is spoken fluently by only about 2% of the population (according to 2001 census). However, 14% of the population claim some understanding of the language. Until the early 20th-century French was the only official language of the Bailiwick, and all deeds for the sale and purchase of real estate in Guernsey were written in French until 1971. Family and place names reflect this linguistic heritage. [[George M\u00e9tivier]], a poet, wrote in Guernesiais. The loss of the island's language and the Anglicisation of its culture, which began in the 19th century and proceeded inexorably for a century, accelerated sharply when the majority of the island's school children were evacuated to the UK for five years during the German occupation of 1940\u201345.\n\n[[File:Renoir16.jpg|thumb|''Children on the Beach of Guernsey'' (1883) by Pierre-Auguste Renoir.]]\nThe French [[impressionist]] painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] visited the island in late summer 1883.

Many Islanders became rich without ever setting foot on a sailing vessel. Ships became larger, with more crew and were better armed as more money was invested.

Not an easy transition for people from the growing industry to an office environment. Profits and salaries were good and the Island had revenues to support long term capital expenditure plans. Continuing through the 1990s with divergence to related industries, such as captive insurance and fund management have managed to keep unemployment low.

The earliest, the [[Ghana Empire]], grew on trade but ultimately fell after repeated incursions of the [[Almoravids]]. It was in this period that Islam first arrived in the region by way of North African traders.\n\nThe [[Sosso]] kingdom (12th to 13th centuries) briefly flourished in the resulting void but the [[Mali Empire]] came to prominence when [[Sundiata Keita|Soundiata K\u00e9\u00efta]] defeated the Sosso ruler [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9|Soumangourou Kant\u00e9]] at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. The Mali Empire was ruled by [[Mansa (title)|Mansa]] (Emperors), the most famous being [[Musa I of Mali|Kankou Moussa]], who made a famous [[hajj]] to Mecca in 1324. Shortly after his reign the Mali Empire began to decline and was ultimately supplanted by its [[vassal]] states in the 15th century.\n\nThe most successful of these was the [[Songhai Empire]], which expanded its power from about 1460 and eventually surpassed the Mali Empire in both territory and wealth. It continued to prosper until a civil war over succession followed the death of [[Askia Daoud]] in 1582. The weakened empire fell to invaders from [[Morocco]] at the [[Battle of Tondibi]] just three years later. The Moroccans proved unable to rule the kingdom effectively, however, and it split into many small kingdoms.\n[[File:Almamy Samory Tour\u00e9.jpg|thumb|[[Samori Toure]] was the founder of the [[Wassoulou Empire]], an [[Islamic]] state in present-day Guinea that resisted [[France|French]] colonial rule in [[West Africa]] from 1882 until Tour\u00e9's capture in 1898.]]\nAfter the fall of the major West African empires, various kingdoms existed in what is now Guinea. [[Fulani]] Muslims migrated to [[Futa Jallon]] in Central Guinea and established an Islamic state from 1735 to 1898 with a written constitution and alternate rulers. The [[Wassoulou Empire|Wassoulou or Wassulu empire]] was a short-lived (1878\u20131898) empire, led by [[Samori Toure]] in the predominantly [[Mandinka people|Malink\u00e9]] area of what is now upper Guinea and southwestern [[Mali]] (Wassoulou). It moved to [[Ivory Coast]] before being conquered by the French.\n\n===Colonial era===\nThe [[slave trade]] came to the coastal region of Guinea with European traders in the 16th century. Slaves were exported to work elsewhere in the [[triangular trade]].\n\nGuinea's colonial period began with French military penetration into the area in the mid-19th century. French domination was assured by the defeat in 1898 of the armies of [[Samori Tour\u00e9]], Mansa (or Emperor) of the [[Ouassoulou]] state and leader of Malink\u00e9 descent, which gave France control of what today is Guinea and adjacent areas.\n\nFrance negotiated Guinea's present boundaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the British for [[Sierra Leone]], the Portuguese for their Guinea colony (now [[Guinea-Bissau]]), and [[Liberia]]. Under the French, the country formed the [[French Guinea|Territory of Guinea]] within [[French West Africa]], administered by a governor general resident in [[Dakar]]. Lieutenant governors administered the individual colonies, including Guinea.\n\n===Independence and post-colonial rule (1958\u20132008)===\nIn 1958, the [[French Fourth Republic]] collapsed due to political instability and its failures in dealing with its colonies, especially [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]]. The founding of a [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] was supported by the French people, while French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] made it clear on 8 August 1958 that France's colonies were to be given a stark choice between more [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] in a new [[French Community]] or immediate independence in the referendum to be held on 28 September 1958. The other colonies chose the former but Guinea\u2014under the leadership of [[Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9]] whose [[Democratic Party of Guinea\u2013African Democratic Rally|Democratic Party of Guinea]] (PDG) had won 56 of 60 seats in 1957 territorial elections \u2014 voted overwhelmingly for independence. The French withdrew quickly, and on 2 October 1958, Guinea proclaimed itself a sovereign and independent republic, with S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 as president.\n[[File:Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 na obisku v Ljubljani 1961 (3).jpg|thumb|President [[Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9]] was supported by the Communist bloc states and in 1961 visited [[Yugoslavia]].]]\n\nFrance's withdrawal resulted in punitive economic reprisals, including the end of all French aid and investment. Guinea subsequently quickly aligned itself with the [[Soviet Union]] and adopted [[Socialism|socialist]] policies. This alliance was short-lived, however, as Guinea moved towards a Chinese model of socialism. Despite this, however, the country continued to receive aid and investment from [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries such as the [[United States]].\n\nBy 1960, Tour\u00e9 had declared the PDG the country's only legal political party and for the next 24 years, the government and the PDG were one.  Tour\u00e9 was reelected unopposed to four seven-year terms as president, and every five years voters were presented with a single list of PDG candidates for the National Assembly. Advocating a hybrid [[African Socialism]] domestically and [[Pan-Africanism]] abroad, Tour\u00e9 quickly became a polarising leader, and his government became intolerant of dissent, imprisoning thousands and stifling the press.\n\nThroughout the 1960s the Guinean government nationalised land, removed French-appointed and traditional chiefs from power, and had strained ties with the French government and French companies. Tour\u00e9's government relied on the Soviet Union and China for infrastructure aid and development but much of this was used for political and not economic purposes (such as the building of large stadiums to hold political rallies). Meanwhile, the country's roads, railways and other infrastructure languished and the economy stagnated.\n\n[[File:22novemberdetail.JPG|thumb|Monument to commemorate the 1970 military victory over the Portuguese raid. The only objective not accomplished by the Portuguese raid was the capture of Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9.]]\n\nOn 22 November 1970, Portuguese forces from neighboring [[Portuguese Guinea]] staged [[Operation Green Sea]], a raid on Conakry by several hundred exiled Guinean opposition forces. Among their goals, the Portuguese military wanted to kill or capture Sekou Toure due his support of the [[PAIGC]], an independence movement and rebel group that carried out attacks inside Portuguese Guinea from their bases in Guinea.<ref>\"Mr Sekou Tour\u00e9, who gave the PAIGC unstinted support during its war against the Portuguese,...\"[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13213487 Black revolt], [[The Economist]] (22 November 1980)</ref> After fierce fighting, the Portuguese-backed forces retreated, having freed several dozen Portuguese prisoners of war that were being held by the PAIGC in Conakry but without having ousted Tour\u00e9. In the years after the raid, massive purges were carried out by the Tour\u00e9 government and at least 50,000 people (1% of Guinea's entire population) was killed. Countless others were imprisoned, faced torture, or, often in the case of foreigners, were forced to leave the country (sometimes after having had their Guinean spouse arrested and their children placed into state custody).\n\nA declining economy, mass killings, a stifling political atmosphere, and a ban on all private economic transactions led in 1977 to the \"[[Guinean Market Women's Revolt|Market Women's Revolt]],\" anti-government riots that were started by women working in Conakry's [[March\u00e9 Madina (Conakry)|Madina Market]]. This caused Tour\u00e9 to make major reforms. Tour\u00e9 vacillated from supporting the [[Soviet Union]] to supporting the United States. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw some economic reforms but Tour\u00e9's centralized control of the state remained. Even the relationship with France improved; after the election of [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] as French president, trade increased and the two countries exchanged diplomatic visits.\n\nS\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 died on 26 March 1984 after a heart operation in the United States, and was replaced by [[Heads of Government of Guinea|Prime Minister]] [[Louis Lansana Beavogui]], who was to serve as interim president pending new elections. The PDG was due to elect a new leader on 3 April 1984. Under the constitution, that person would have been the only candidate for president. However, hours before that meeting, Colonels [[Lansana Cont\u00e9]] and [[Diarra Traor\u00e9]] seized power in a bloodless [[coup]]. Cont\u00e9 assumed the role of president, with Traor\u00e9 serving as prime minister until December.\n\nCont\u00e9 immediately denounced the previous regime's record on [[human rights]], released 250 political prisoners and encouraged approximately 200,000 more to return from exile. He also made explicit the turn away from socialism, but this did little to alleviate poverty and the country showed no immediate signs of moving towards [[democracy]].\n\nIn 1992, Cont\u00e9 announced a return to civilian rule, with a presidential poll in 1993 followed by elections to parliament in 1995 (in which his party\u2014the [[Party of Unity and Progress]]\u2014won 71 of 114 seats.) Despite his stated commitment to democracy, Cont\u00e9's grip on power remained tight. In September 2001, the opposition leader [[Alpha Cond\u00e9]] was imprisoned for endangering state security, though he was pardoned 8 months later.

Other industries include processing plants for beer, juices, soft drinks and tobacco. Agriculture employs 80% of the nation's labor force. Under French rule, and at the beginning of independence, Guinea was a major exporter of bananas, [[pineapples]], coffee, peanuts, and [[palm oil]].

In addition, Guinea's mineral wealth includes more than 4-billion tonnes of high-grade [[iron ore]], significant diamond and gold deposits, and undetermined quantities of [[uranium]]. Possibilities for investment and commercial activities exist in all these areas, but Guinea's poorly developed [[infrastructure]] and rampant [[corruption]] continue to present obstacles to large-scale investment projects.\n\n[[Joint venture]] [[bauxite]] mining and alumina operations in northwest Guinea historically provide about 80% of Guinea's [[Foreign exchange reserves|foreign exchange]]. Bauxite is refined into alumina, which is later [[smelting|smelted]] into aluminium.  The ''{{ILL|Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinea|fr}}'' (CBG), which exports about 14 million tonnes of high-grade bauxite annually, is the main player in the bauxite industry.

[[Dian Dian]], a Guinean/[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] joint bauxite venture, has a projected production rate of {{convert|1000000|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} per year, but is not expected to begin operation for several years. The ''[[Alumina Company of Guinea|Alumina Compagnie de Guin\u00e9e]]'' (ACG), which took over the former Friguia Consortium, produced about 2.4&nbsp;million tonnes in 2004 as raw material for its alumina refinery. The refinery exports about 750,000 tonnes of alumina. Both Global Alumina and Alcoa-Alcan have signed conventions with the government of Guinea to build large alumina refineries with a combined capacity of about 4 million tonnes per year.\n\nDiamonds and gold also are mined and exported on a large scale. The bulk of diamonds are mined [[artisanal mining|artisanally]]. The largest gold mining operation in Guinea is a joint venture between the government and [[Ashanti Goldfields]] of [[Ghana]]. AREDOR, a joint diamond-mining venture between the Guinean Government (50%) and an Australian, British, and Swiss [[consortium]], began production in 1984 and mined diamonds that were 90% gem quality. Production stopped from 1993 until 1996, when First City Mining of Canada purchased the international portion of the consortium. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mini\u00e8re de Dinguiraye (SMD) also has a large gold mining facility in Lero, near the Malian border.\n\n===Oil===\nGuinea signed a [[production sharing agreement]] with Hyperdynamics Corporation of [[Houston]] in 2006 to explore a large offshore tract, and was recently in partnership with [[Dana Petroleum]] PLC ([[Aberdeen]], United Kingdom). The initial well, the Sabu-1, was scheduled to begin drilling in October 2011 at a site in approximately 700&nbsp;meters of water.  The Sabu-1 targeted a four-way [[anticline]] prospect with [[upper Cretaceous]] sands and was anticipated to be drilled to a total depth of 3,600&nbsp;meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://investors.hyperdynamics.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=600343 |title=Hyperdynamics Corporation - Jasper Explorer Drill Ship En Route to Hyperdynamics' First Exploration Drilling Site Offshore Guinea |website=Investors.hyperdynamics.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914023859/http://investors.hyperdynamics.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=600343 |archive-date=14 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the completion of exploratory [[drilling]] in 2012, the Sabu-1 well was not deemed commercially viable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offshore-technology.com/news/newshyperdynamics-completes-drilling-of-sabu-1-well-offshore-guinea-conakry|title=Hyperdynamics completes drilling at Sabu-1 well offshore Guinea-Conakry|website=Offshore-technology.com|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref> In November 2012, Hyperdynamics subsidiary SCS reached an agreement for a sale of 40% of the concession to [[Tullow Oil]], bringing ownership shares in the Guinea offshore tract to 37% Hyperdynamics, 40% Tullow Oil, and 23% Dana Petroleum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tullowoil.com/index.asp?pageid=137&newsid=805|title=Tullow Oil Agrees Farm-in to Guinea Concession|website=Tullowoil.com|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref> Hyperdynamics will have until September 2016 under the current agreement to begin drilling its next selected site, the Fatala [[Cenomanian]] [[turbidite]] fan prospect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperdynamics.com/guinea_project.htm|title=Overview of the Guinea Project|website=Hyperdynamics.com|author1=Hyperdynamics|accessdate=3 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203114454/http://www.hyperdynamics.com/guinea_project.htm|archive-date=3 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://doc.research-and-analytics.csfb.com/docView?document_id=x548038&serialid=6XKHhijcT%2B6Xg1jfyFmVuwQySL6HHtJCNiU0UlOijDA%3D|title=Tullow Oil|date=21 January 2014|publisher=Credit Suisse|page=15|work=Equity Research|author1=Thomas Adolff|author2=Charlotte Elliott|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nThe majority of Guineans work in the agriculture sector, which employs approximately 75% of the country. The rice is cultivated in the flooded zones between streams and rivers. However,  the local production of rice is not sufficient to feed the country, so rice is imported from Asia. The [[agriculture in Guinea|agriculture sector of Guinea]] cultivates coffee beans, pineapples, peaches, nectarines, [[mango]]es, [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, pepper, and many other types of produce. Guinea is one of the emerging regional producers of apples and pears. There are many plantations of grapes, pomegranates, and recent years have seen the development of strawberry plantations based on the vertical hydroponic system.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n[[File:Le \"Voile\" de la mari\u00e9e \u00e0 Kindia.png|thumb|Le \"Voile\" de la mari\u00e9e \u00e0 Kindia]]\nDue to its diverse geography, Guinea presents some interesting tourist sites. Among the top attractions are the waterfalls found mostly in the Basse Guinee (Lower Guinea) and Moyenne Guinee (Middle Guinea) regions. The Soumba cascade at the foot of Mount Kakoulima in Kindia, Voile de la Mariee (bride's veil) in Dubreka, Kinkon cascades of about 80 m high on the Kokoula river in the prefecture of Pita, the Kambadaga falls on the same river that can reach 100 m high during the raining season, the Ditinn & Mitty waterfalls in Dalaba, Fetor\u00e9 waterfalls and the stone bridge in the region of Labe are among the well known water-related tourist sites.\n\n==Problems and reforms==\nIn 2002, the [[IMF]] suspended Guinea's [[Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility]] (PRGF) because the government failed to meet key performance criteria. In reviews of the PRGF, the World Bank noted that Guinea had met its spending goals in targeted social priority sectors. However, spending in other areas, primarily defense, contributed to a significant fiscal deficit.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The loss of IMF funds forced the government to finance its debts through [[Central Bank]] advances. The pursuit of unsound economic policies has resulted in imbalances that are proving hard to correct.\n\nUnder then-Prime Minister Diallo, the government began a rigorous reform agenda in December 2004 designed to return Guinea to a PRGF with the IMF. Exchange rates have been allowed to float, price controls on gasoline have been loosened, and government spending has been reduced while tax collection has been improved. These reforms have not reduced inflation, which hit 27% in 2004 and 30% in 2005. [[Currency depreciation]] is also a concern. The Guinea franc was trading at 2550 to the dollar in January 2005. It hit 5554 to the dollar by October 2006. In August 2016 that number had reached 9089.\n\nDespite the opening in 2005 of a new road connecting Guinea and Mali, most major roadways remain in poor repair, slowing the delivery of goods to local markets. Electricity and water shortages are frequent and sustained, and many businesses are forced to use expensive power generators and fuel to stay open.\n\nEven though there are many problems plaguing Guinea's economy, not all foreign investors are reluctant to come to Guinea. Global Alumina's proposed alumina refinery has a price tag above $2&nbsp;billion. Alcoa and Alcan are proposing a slightly smaller refinery worth about $1.5&nbsp;billion. Taken together, they represent the largest private investment in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] since the [[Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project|Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline]]. Also, Hyperdynamics Corporation, an American oil company, signed an agreement in 2006 to develop Guinea's offshore [[Senegal River|Senegal Basin]] oil deposits in a concession of {{convert|31000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}; it is pursuing seismic exploration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperdynamics.com/media/HDY-JV-Partner-Opportunity-Brochure-082208.pdf|title=Joint Venture Opportunity Offshore the West Coast of Africa|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207130218/http://www.hyperdynamics.com/media/HDY-JV-Partner-Opportunity-Brochure-082208.pdf|archivedate=7 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}Hyperdynamics Corporation (2008)</ref>\n\nOn 13 October 2009, Guinean Mines Minister Mahmoud Thiam announced that the [[China International Fund]] would invest more than $7bn (\u00a34.5bn) in infrastructure.

In early August 2014 Guinea closed its borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia to help contain the spreading of the virus, as more new cases of the disease were being reported in those countries than in Guinea.\n\nThe outbreak began in early December, in a village called Meliandou, southeastern Guinea, not far from the borders with both Liberia and Sierra Leone. The first known case was a two-year-old child who died, after fever and vomiting and passing black stool, on December 6. The child's mother died a week later, then a sister and a grandmother, all with symptoms that included fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Then, by way of caregiving visits or attendance at funerals, the outbreak spread to other villages.\n\nUnsafe burials remained one of the primary sources of the transmission of the disease.

Its current boundaries were determined during the colonial period by the [[Berlin Conference]] (1884-1885) and the French, who ruled Guinea until 1958.\n\n==West African empires==\nWhat is now Guinea was on the fringes of the major [[West Africa]]n empires. The [[Ghana Empire]] is believed to be the earliest of these which grew on trade but contracted and ultimately fell due to the hostile influence of the [[Almoravids]]. It was in this period that Islam first arrived in the region.\n\nThe [[Sosso]] kingdom (12th to 13th centuries) briefly flourished in the void but the Islamic [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] [[Mali Empire]] came to prominence when [[Sundiata Keita|Soundiata K\u00e9\u00efta]] defeated the Sosso ruler, [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9|Sumanguru Kant\u00e9]] at the semi-historical [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. The Mali Empire was ruled by [[Mansa (title)|Mansa]] (Emperors), the most famous being [[Musa I of Mali|Kankou Moussa]], who made a famous [[hajj]] to Mecca in 1324. Shortly after his reign the Mali Empire began to decline and was ultimately supplanted by its [[vassal]] states in the 15th century.\n\nThe most successful of these was the [[Songhai Empire]], expanding its power from about 1460, and eventually surpassing the Mali Empire in both territory and wealth. It continued to prosper until a civil war over succession followed the death of [[Askia Daoud]] in 1582. The weakened empire fell to invaders from [[Morocco]] at the [[Battle of Tondibi]] just 3 years later. The Moroccans proved unable to rule the kingdom effectively, however, and it split into many small kingdoms.\n\n==Kingdoms in Guinea==\nAfter the fall of the major West African empires, various kingdoms existed in what is now Guinea.\n\n===Futa Jallon===\n{{main|Imamate of Futa Jallon}}\n[[Fulani]] Muslims migrated to [[Futa Jallon]] in Central Guinea and established an Islamic state from 1735 to 1898 with a written constitution and alternate rulers.\n\n===Wassoulou Empire===\n{{Main|Wassoulou Empire}}\nThe Wassoulou empire was a short-lived (1878\u20131898) empire, led by [[Samory Tour\u00e9]] in the predominantly [[Mandinka people|Malink\u00e9]] area of what is now upper [[Guinea]] and southwestern [[Mali]] (Wassoulou). It moved to [[Ivory Coast]] before being conquered by the French.\n\n==Colonial era==\nThe [[slave trade]] came to the coastal region of Guinea with European adventurers in the 16th century. Slavery had always been part of everyday life but the scale increased as slaves were exported to work elsewhere in the [[triangular trade]].\n\nGuinea's colonial period began with French military penetration into the area in the mid-19th century. French domination was assured by the defeat in 1898 of the armies of [[Samori Tour\u00e9]], Mansa (or Emperor) of the [[Ouassoulou]] state and leader of Malink\u00e9 descent, which gave France control of what today is Guinea and adjacent areas.\n\nFrance negotiated Guinea's present boundaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the British for [[Sierra Leone]], the Portuguese for their Guinea colony (now [[Guinea-Bissau]]), and [[Liberia]]. Under the French, the country formed the [[French Guinea|Territory of Guinea]] within [[French West Africa]], administered by a governor general resident in [[Dakar]]. Lieutenant governors administered the individual colonies, including Guinea.\n\n==Independence (1958)==\nIn 1958 the [[French Fourth Republic]] collapsed due to political instability and its failures in dealing with its colonies, especially [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]]. The founding of a [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] was supported by the French people, while French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] made it clear on 8 August 1958 that France's colonies were to be given a stark choice between more [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] in a new [[French Community]] and immediate independence in the referendum to be held on 28 September 1958.\n\nThe other French colonies chose the former but Guinea \u2014 under the leadership of [[Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9]] whose [[Democratic Party of Guinea]] (PDG) had won 56 of 60 seats in 1957 territorial elections \u2014 voted overwhelmingly for independence. The French withdrew quickly, and on October 2, 1958, Guinea proclaimed itself a sovereign and independent republic, with S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 as president.\n\n===S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9's rule (1958-1984)===\n[[File:DF-SC-83-08641.jpg|thumb|300px|President [[Ahmed Sekou Toure]] arrives for a visit to Washington D.C., June 1982.]]\n\nFollowing France's withdrawal, Guinea quickly aligned itself with the [[Soviet Union]] and adopted [[Socialism|socialist]] policies. This alliance was short lived, however, as Guinea moved towards a Chinese model of socialism. Despite this, however, the country continued to receive aid and investment from [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries such as the U.S.. Even the relationship with France improved, after the election of [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] as president, trade increased and the two countries exchanged diplomatic visits.\n\nBy 1960, Tour\u00e9 had declared the PDG the only legal party.  For the next 24 years, the government and the PDG were one.  Tour\u00e9 was reelected unopposed to four seven-year terms as president, and every five years voters were presented with a single list of PDG candidates for the National Assembly.  Advocating a hybrid [[African Socialism]] domestically and [[Pan-Africanism]] abroad, Tour\u00e9 quickly became a polarising leader, and his government became intolerant of dissent, imprisoning hundreds, and stifling free press.\n\nAt the same time, the Guinean government nationalised land, removed French appointed and traditional chiefs from power, and broke ties with French government and companies. Vacillating between support for the [[Soviet Union]] and (by the late 1970s) the United States, Guinea's economic situation became as unpredictable as its diplomatic line. Alleging plots and conspiracies against him at home and abroad, Tour\u00e9\u2019s regime targeted real and imagined opponents, driving thousands of political opponents into exile.\n\nIn 1970, Portuguese forces, from neighboring [[Portuguese Guinea]], staged [[Operation Green Sea]], a raid into Guinea with the support of exiled Guinean opposition forces. Among other goals, the Portuguese military wanted to kill or capture Sekou Toure due his support of the [[PAIGC]], a guerilla movement operating inside Portuguese Guinea.<ref>\"Mr Sekou Tour\u00e9, who gave the PAIGC unstinted support during its war against the Portuguese,...\"[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13213487 Black revolt], [[The Economist]] (Nov 22nd 1980)</ref> After several days of fierce fighting, the Portuguese forces retreated without achieving most of their goals. The regime of S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 increased the number of internal arrests and executions.\n\nThe [[Guinean Market Women's Revolt]] in 1977 resulted in the regime's softening of economic restrictions and began a turn away from the radical socialism previously practiced by the government.\n\nS\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 died on March 26, 1984 after a heart operation in the United States, and was replaced by [[Heads of Government of Guinea|Prime Minister]] [[Louis Lansana Beavogui]], who was to serve as interim president pending new elections.\n\n===Lansana Cont\u00e9's rule (1984-2008)===\nThe PDG was due to elect a new leader on April 3, 1984.  Under the constitution, that person would have been the only candidate for president.  However, hours before that meeting, Colonels [[Lansana Cont\u00e9]] and [[Diarra Traor\u00e9]] seized power in a bloodless [[coup]]. Cont\u00e9 assumed the role of president, with Traor\u00e9 serving as prime minister until December.\n\nCont\u00e9 immediately denounced the previous regime\u2019s record on [[human rights]], released 250 political prisoners and encouraged approximately 200,000 more to return from exile. He also made explicit the turn away from socialism, but this did little to alleviate poverty and the country showed no immediate signs of moving towards [[democracy]].\n\nIn 1992, Cont\u00e9 announced a return to civilian rule, with a presidential poll in 1993 followed by elections to parliament in 1995 (in which his party - the [[Party of Unity and Progress]] - won 71 of 114 seats.) Despite his stated commitment to democracy, Cont\u00e9's grip on power remained tight. In September 2001 the opposition leader [[Alpha Cond\u00e9]] was imprisoned for endangering state security, though he was pardoned 8 months later. He subsequently spent a period of exile in France.\n\nIn 2001 Cont\u00e9 organized and won a referendum to lengthen the presidential term and in 2003 begun his third term after elections were boycotted by the opposition. In January 2005, Cont\u00e9 survived a suspected assassination attempt while making a rare public appearance in the capital [[Conakry]]. His opponents claimed that he was a \"tired dictator\" <ref>[http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616165043/http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |date=June 16, 2007 }}</ref> whose departure was inevitable, whereas his supporters believed that he was winning a battle with dissidents.

Its [[geographic coordinates]] are {{coord|11|00|N|10|00|W|type:country}}. Guinea's total area is 245,857&nbsp;km\u00b2, comprising 245,717&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land and 140&nbsp;km\u00b2 of water.\n\nGuinea's land boundaries span a total of 4,046&nbsp;km: with [[Ivory Coast]] 816&nbsp;km, [[Guinea-Bissau]] 421&nbsp;km, [[Liberia]] 590&nbsp;km, [[Mali]] 1,062&nbsp;km, [[Senegal]] 363&nbsp;km, and [[Sierra Leone]] 794&nbsp;km. It has a 320-km coastline, and claims an [[exclusive economic zone]] of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on|lk=in}}, with a territorial sea of {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Guinea Topography.png|thumb|450px|Guinea's topography.]]\n\nThe coastal region of Guinea and most of the inland have a tropical climate, with a [[monsoon]]al-type rainy season lasting from April to November, relatively high and uniform temperatures, southwesterly winds, and high humidity.\n\nThe capital [[Conakry]]'s year-round average high is {{convert|29|C|F|1}}, and the low is {{convert|23|C|F|1}}. Conakry's average annual rainfall is {{convert|4300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Sahelian Upper Guinea has a shorter rainy season and greater daily temperature variations. There is a dry season (December to May) with northeasterly [[harmattan]] winds.\n\n== Rivers and water ==\n{{Further|List of rivers of Guinea}}\n\nThe [[Niger River]], the [[Gambia River]], and the [[Senegal River]] are among the 22 West African rivers that have their origins in Guinea.\n\n==Ecoregions==\n* [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] covers most of the country, covering most of Maritime Guinea and Upper Guinea, as well as the lower elevations of the Fouta Djallon. It extends north into Guinea Bissau and Senegal, and east though Mali and Ivory Coast.\n* [[Western Guinean lowland forests]] occupies the southwestern portion of Maritime Guinea around Conakry, and Forest Guinea, along with coastal Sierra Leone, Liberia, and western Ivory Coast.\n* [[Guinean montane forests]], cover the Fouta Djallon and [[Guinea Highlands]] of southeast Guinea above 600 meters elevation.\n* [[Guinean mangroves]], in the coastal estuaries. Enclaves extend north into Guinea Bissau, Gambia and Senegal, and southeast through Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ivory Coast.\n\n==Resources and environment==\n\nThe country's natural resources include [[bauxite]], [[iron ore]], [[diamond]]s, [[gold]], [[uranium]], hydropower, fish, and salt. It has 12.21% arable land, and 2.85% of the land is permanent crops. 949.2&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2003) of land is irrigated.  Guinea's total renewable water resources total 226&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>.\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\nCurrent environmental issues in Guinea include: [[deforestation]]; inadequate supplies of potable water; [[desertification]]; soil contamination and erosion; and [[overfishing]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] in forest regions.  Poor [[mining]] practices have led to environmental damage.\n\nGuinea is party to the following international environmental agreements: [[Biodiversity]], [[Climate Change]], [[Desertification]], Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, [[Law of the Sea]], Ozone Layer Protection, [[Ship Pollution]], Wetlands, Whaling.\n\n== Terrain ==\n\nIts terrain is generally flat coastal plain, hilly to mountainous interior.

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the [[National Assembly of Guinea|National Assembly]].\n\n==Political history==\n\n=== Cont\u00e9 era (1984-2008) ===\nA military dictatorship, led by then-Lt. Col. [[Lansana Cont\u00e9]] and styling itself the Military Committee of National Recovery (CMRN), took control of Guinea in April 1984, shortly after the death of independent Guinea's first president, [[S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9]]. With Cont\u00e9 as president, the CMRN set about dismantling Tour\u00e9's oppressive regime, abolishing the authoritarian constitution, dissolving the sole political party and its mass youth and women's organizations, and announcing the establishment of the Second Republic. The new government released all political prisoners and committed itself to the protection of [[human rights]].  In order to reverse the steady economic decline under [[Sekou Toure|Tour\u00e9]]'s rule, the CMRN reorganized the judicial system, decentralized the administration, promoted private enterprise, and encouraged foreign [[investment]].\n\nIn 1990, Guineans approved by referendum a new constitution that inaugurated the Third Republic, and established a [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]]. In 1991, the CMRN was replaced by a mixed military and civilian body, the Transitional Council for National Recovery (CTRN), with [[Lansana Cont\u00e9|Cont\u00e9]] as president and a mandate to manage a five-year transition to full civilian rule. The CTRN drafted laws to create republican institutions and to provide for independent [[political parties]], national elections, and [[freedom of the press]]. Political party activity was legalized in 1992, when more than 40 political parties were officially recognized for the first time.\n\nIn December 1993, [[Lansana Cont\u00e9|Cont\u00e9]] was elected to a 5-year term as president in the country's first multi-party elections, which were marred by irregularities and lack of [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] on the part of the government. In 1995, Cont\u00e9's ruling PUP party won 76 of 114 seats in elections for the National Assembly amid opposition claims of irregularities and government tampering. In 1996, President Cont\u00e9 reorganized the government, appointing Sidya Tour\u00e9 to the revived post of Prime Minister and charging him with special responsibility for leading the government's economic reform program. \nIn the early hours of 23 December 2008, [[Aboubacar Sompar\u00e9]], the President of the National Assembly, announced on television that Cont\u00e9 had died at 6:45pm local time on 22 December \"after a long illness\",<ref name=AFP>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jFamnEzZhIYHzv_eUXSc1TxAMfkA \"Guinea's long-time military leader Conte dies\"], AFP, 23 December 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227015341/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jFamnEzZhIYHzv_eUXSc1TxAMfkA |date=27 December 2008 }}</ref> without specifying the cause of death.<ref name=Dies>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/12/23/africa/AF-Guinea-Obit-Conte.php \"Guinea's dictator, Lansana Conte, dies\"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), 23 December 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110012847/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/12/23/africa/AF-Guinea-Obit-Conte.php |date=10 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Sompar\u00e9, Cont\u00e9 \"hid his physical suffering\" for years \"in order to give happiness to Guinea.\"<ref name=\"Dies\"/> Cont\u00e9 had left the country for medical treatment on numerous occasions in the years preceding his death,<ref name=AFP/> and speculation about his health had long been widespread.

After Independence, these countries did not become completely economical free. France decided against monetary autonomy hence they could not use a freely convertible currency. The state intervention of the new governments was characterized by stops of quotas on imports and internal price controls. In the time up to c. 1980, the franc-zone countries had on average a lower inflation and a higher economic growth compared to the Anglophone counterparts, who could use their own currencies. \nBut regarding the time after c. 1980 and the economic liberalism, characterized by Structural Adjustments, the franc zone countries could not outperform the rest.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The government has eliminated restrictions on agricultural enterprise and foreign trade, liquidated many parastatals, increased spending on education, and vastly downsized the civil service. The government also has made major strides in restructuring the public finances.\n\nThe IMF and the World Bank are heavily involved in the development of Guinea's economy, as are many bilateral donor nations, including the United States. Guinea's economic reforms have had recent notable success, improving the rate of economic to 5% and reducing the rate of inflation to about 99%, as well as increasing government revenues while restraining official expenditures. Although Guinea's external debt burden remains high, the country is now current on external debt payments.\n\n[http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html Current GDP per capita] of Guinea shrank by 16% in the 1990s.\n\nThe government revised the private investment code in 1998 to stimulate economic activity in the spirit of a free enterprise. The code does not discriminate between foreigners and nationals and provides for repatriation of profits. Foreign investments outside [[Conakry]] are entitled to especially favorable conditions. A national investment commission has been formed to review all investment proposals. The United States and Guinea have signed an investment guarantee agreement that offers political risk insurance to American investors through [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation|OPIC]]. Guinea plans to inaugurate an arbitration court system to allow for the quick resolution of commercial disputes.\n\nMean wages were $0.45 per [[man-hour]] in 2009.\n\n== Economic sectors ==\n\n===Mining===\n{{main|Mining industry of Guinea}}\nBauxite mining and alumina production provide about 80% of Guinea's foreign exchange. Several U.S. companies are active in this sector. Diamonds and gold also are mined and exported on a large scale, providing additional foreign exchange. Concession agreements have been signed for future exploitation of Guinea's extensive iron ore deposits.\n\nGuinea is richly endowed with minerals, possessing an estimated one-third of the world's proven reserves of bauxite, more than 1.8 billion metric tons (MT) (2.0 billion short tons) of high-grade iron ore, significant diamond and gold deposits, and undetermined quantities of uranium.\n\nLately, with the increase of alumina demand from the booming economy of [[China]], there is a renew interest in Guinea riches. The consortium [[Alcan]] and [[Alcoa]],  partner with the Guinean government in the CBG mining in north western Guinea, have announced the feasibility study for the construction of a 1 million TPa [[alumina]] smelter. This comes with a similar project from Canadian start-up Global Alumina trying to come with a 2&nbsp;billion dollar alumina plant in the same region. As of April 2005, the National Assembly of Guinea has not ratified Global's project.\n\nRevenue from bauxite mining is expected to fall significantly in 2010 due mainly to the world economic situation.<ref>[http://www.miningweekly.com/article/guinea-bauxite-income-seen-down-60-in-2010-2009-09-28 ''Mining Weekly'', \"Guinea bauxite income seen down 60% in 2010\" 28 September 2009 (original source: Reuters)]</ref>\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{Further|Agriculture in Guinea}}\n\nGuinea also has considerable potential for growth in the agricultural and fishing sectors. Land, water, and climatic conditions provide opportunities for large-scale irrigated farming and agroindustry. Possibilities for investment and commercial activities exist in all these areas, but Guinea's poorly developed infrastructure continues to present obstacles to investment projects.\n\n=== Energy ===\n{{Further|Energy in Guinea}}\n\nThree primary energy sources make up the energy mix in Guinea - [[biomass]], [[oil]] and [[hydropower]]. With 78%, biomass (mostly charcoal) makes the largest contribution in primary energy consumption in Guinea. It is locally produced, while Guinea imports all [[petroleum]] products.\n\n=== Communications ===\n{{Further|Telecommunications in Guinea}}\n\nThe people of Guinea are among the poorest in West Africa<ref name=BBCNews-GuineaProfile-2012>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13442054 \"\"], ''BBC News'', 14 March 2012. Retrieved 4 February 2014.</ref> and this reality is reflected in the development of the country's telecommunications environment. Radio is the most important source of information for the public in Guinea, and the only one to reach the entire country.\n\nThere is a single government-owned radio network, a growing number of private radio stations, and one government TV station. The fixed telephone system is inadequate, with just 18,000 lines to serve the country's 10.5 million inhabitants in 2012. The mobile cellular system is growing rapidly and had an estimated 4.8 million lines in 2012. Internet usage is very low, reaching just 1.5% of the population in 2012.\n\n== Economic statistics ==\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=62&pr.y=13&sy=1980&ey=2023&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=656&s=NGDPD,PPPGDP,PPPPC,PCPIPCH,GGXWDG_NGDP&grp=0&a=|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-09-07|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=en-US|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Year\n!1990\n!1995\n!2000\n!2005\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n|-\n|GDP in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|5.51 Bln.\n|7.53 Bln.\n|9.92 Bln.\n|12.96 Bln.\n|13.70 Bln.\n|14.98 Bln.\n|15.90 Bln.\n|15.78 Bln.\n|16.64 Bln.\n|17.94 Bln.\n|19.35 Bln.\n|20.44 Bln.\n|21.57 Bln.\n|22.57 Bln.\n|24.37 Bln.\n|26.47 Bln.\n|-\n|GDP per capita in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|916\n|961\n|1,134\n|1,354\n|1,398\n|1,490\n|1,542\n|1,489\n|1,530\n|1,607\n|1,690\n|1,740\n|1,791\n|1,828\n|1,926\n|2,041\n|-\n|GDP growth<br /><small>(real)</small>\n|3.7 %\n|5.1 %\n|4.0 %\n|4.5 %\n|4.2 %\n|6.3 %\n|7.0 %\n|\u22120.6 %\n|6.9 %\n|6.0 %\n|7.3 %\n|8.4 %\n|8.8 %\n|8.8 %\n|8.2 %\n|9.7 %\n|-\n|Inflation<br /><small>(in Percent)</small>\n|25.7 %\n|5.6 %\n|6.8 %\n|31.4 %\n|34.7 %\n|22.9 %\n|18.4 %\n|4.7 %\n|15.5 %\n|21.4 %\n|15.2 %\n|11.9 %\n|9.7 %\n|8.2 %\n|8.2 %\n|8.9 %\n|-\n|Government debt<br /><small>(Percentage of GDP)</small>\n|72 %\n|67 %\n|91 %\n|98 %\n|95 %\n|61 %\n|58 %\n|61 %\n|69 %\n|58 %\n|27 %\n|34 %\n|35 %\n|42 %\n|43 %\n|40 %\n|}\n\n[[File:2006Guinea exports.PNG|thumb|450px|Guinea's export destinations in 2006.]]\n\n'''GDP:'''\npurchasing power parity - $26.5 billion (2017 est.)\n\n'''GDP - real growth rate:'''\n6.7% (2017 est.)\n\n'''GDP - per capita:'''\npurchasing power parity - $2,000 (2017 est.)\n\n'''GDP - composition by sector:'''\n<br>''agriculture:''\n19.5%\n<br>''industry:''\n38.4%\n<br>''services:''\n42.1% (2017 est.)\n\n'''Population below poverty line:'''\n47% (2006 est.)\n\n'''Household income or consumption by percentage share:'''\n<br>''lowest 10%:''\n2.7% (2007)\n<br>''highest 10%:''\n30.3% (2007)\n\n'''Inflation rate (consumer prices):'''\n8.9% (2017 est.)\n\n'''Labor force:'''\n5.558 million (2017)\n\n'''Labor force - by occupation:'''\nagriculture 76%, industry and services 24% (2006 est.)\n\n'''Unemployment rate:'''\n2.8% (2017 est.)\n\n'''Ease of Doing Business Rank'''\n179th<ref name=\" World Bank and International Financial Corporation \">{{cite web|url= http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/guinea/|title= Doing Business in Guinea 2012|publisher=[[World Bank]]|accessdate=2011-11-18}}</ref>\n\n'''Budget:'''\n<br>''revenues:''\n$382.7 million\n<br>''expenditures:''\n$711.4 million, including capital expenditures of NA (2004 est.)\n\n'''Industries:'''\n[[bauxite]], [[gold]], [[diamond]]s;

They are responsible for the territorial security of Guinea's border and the defence of the country against external attack and aggression.\n\nGuinea's armed forces are divided into five branches \u2014 army, navy, air force, the paramilitary National [[Gendarmerie]] and the [[Republican Guard (Guinea)|Republican Guard]] \u2014 whose chiefs report to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is subordinate to the Minister of Defense. In addition, regime security forces include the National Police Force (S\u00fbret\u00e9 National). The Gendarmerie, responsible for internal security, has a strength of several thousand, and is armed with military equipment. It is aided by the Republican Guard, which provides protection for government officials.\n\n==History==\nUpon independence in 1958, France cut all ties and immediately began to repatriate Guinean soldiers serving in the [[French Army]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Area Handbook for Guinea |last=Nelson|first=Harold D.|year=February 1975 |publisher=[[United States Department of the Army]] Pamphlet 550-174 | edition=Second|location=|isbn= |pages=327\u20138|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Of the about 22,000 Guinean soldiers in French service, about 10,000 decided to remain with France. The other 12,000 were demobilised and returned to Guinea. The new armed forces were formed by incorporating some of the former French soldiers, after a careful screening process to determine political reliability, with members of the former territorial Gendarmie to form the '''People's Army of Guinea''' ('''L'Armee Populaire de Guinee)'''. By the end of January 1959 the new army had reached a strength of around 2,000 officers and soldiers.\n\nIn February 1969, the Guinean government moved against the armed forces after alleging that a plot centred in [[Lab\u00e9]], the centre of the [[Fula people|Fula]] ({{lang-fr|Peul|links=no}}; {{lang-ff|Ful\u0253e}}) homeland was planning to assassinate Toure and seize power, or, failing that, force the secession of [[Middle Guinea]].<ref>Nelson et al 1975, p.318</ref> This followed military dissatisfaction over the creation of a PDG control element in each army unit. Later the alleged Fula connection was dropped, the accusations widened to other groups, and over 1,000 Guineans arrested. After the plot, the army was regarded by the government as a centre of potential subversion, and the militia was developed as a counterforce to any military threat to the government.\n\nThe army resisted the [[Operation Green Sea|Portuguese invasion of Guinea]] in November 1970. Purges that followed the 1970 invasion decimated the upper ranks of the army, with eight officers sentenced to death and 900 officers and men who had reached a certain age retired from active duty.<ref>Nelson et al 1975, p.321, 329</ref> General Noumandian Keita, chief of the Combined Arms General Staff, was convicted and replaced by the army's chief of staff, Namory Kieta, who was promoted to general.\n\nIn March 1971 elements of the military were deployed to [[Freetown]] in [[Sierra Leone]] after the Sierra Leonean President, Stevens, appeared to start losing his control of the military.<ref>John-Peter Pham, ''Child Soldiers, Adult Interests: the Global Dimensions of the Sierra Leonean Tragedy'', p.42, via [[Google Books]]</ref> Stevens visited Conakry on 19 March 1971, and soon afterwards, around 200 Guinean soldiers were despatched to Freetown. Two Guinean [[MiG]]s made a low flyover of Freetown and Tour\u00e9 placed the Guinean military on alert 'because of the serious troubles affecting the fraternal peoples of Sierra Leone.' The force, also reported as numbering 300, protected Stevens, though it was shortly reduced to 100 and then to fifty, plus a helicopter. The last Guinean troops were withdrawn in 1974.<ref>Nelson et al 1975, p.341</ref>\n\nIn early 1975 the Guinean military consisted of an army of around 5,000, an air force of 300, and a naval component of around 200. The army comprised four infantry battalions, one armoured battalion, and one engineer battalion.<ref>Nelson et al 1975, p.331</ref> In the early 1970s the armed forces were organised into four military zones, corresponding to the four geographical regions ([[Lower Guinea]], [[Middle Guinea]], [[Upper Guinea]], and [[Guin\u00e9e foresti\u00e8re]]). One of the four infantry battalions was assigned to each of the military zones. The zone headquarters also doubled as battalion headquarters, and acted as a supervisory element for elements of company and platoon size assigned to each of the country's twenty-nine administrative regions.<ref>Nelson et al 1975, p.331-332</ref>\n\nThe only concentration of troops in [[Conakry]] appeared to be the armoured battalion, with a modest number of Soviet medium tanks manufactured in the late 1940s, as well as Soviet APCs, and elements of the engineer battalion. The armed forces, though formally responsible for defending the country's territorial integrity, were really during that period focused upon national development tasks, including agricultural, industrial, and construction tasks. The engineer battalion had companies in Conakry, [[Kankan]], and [[Bok\u00e9]], and was engaged in constructing and repairing buildings and roads.\n\n===The Militia===\nIncreasing mistrust of the regular armed forces after the [[Lab\u00e9]] plot led to the militia assuming greater importance.<ref>Nelson et al 1975, p.328-9, 338-9</ref>  The militia had grown out of a 1961 [[Democratic Party of Guinea]] (PDG) decision to create workplace \u2018committees for the defence of the revolution.\u2019 These committees were encouraged by party officials to report dishonest practices such as theft and embezzlement of funds which might \u2018endanger the achievements of the revolution.\u2019\n\nThe PDG youth arm, the Youth of the African Democratic Revolution (JRDA) was especially exhorted to report irregularities and crime to party or police authorities. Units of volunteers, formed in response to this call, assumed limited policing functions. Following government praise for these units\u2019 efforts, the militia's role expanded, especially as black-market activity and smuggling grew worse. The force was formalized as the Popular Militia (Milices Populaires) in the early 1960s, given distinctive uniforms, and linked to the developing civic service, which was engaged on national development tasks. After 1966 it was consciously modeled after the [[China|Chinese]] [[Red Guards]].\n\nIn 1969, the militia was officially granted a role equivalent to the army, as a counterbalance in any military coup d'\u00e9tat. The elements in the Conakry area were issued small arms and given military training. Tour\u00e9 had heralded this policy in 1967 when he wrote: \u2018thanks to their special political, physical, and social training, the people's militia will become the indisputable mainspring of our security system, of which the conventional armed forces constitute [but] a fundamental section.\u2019<ref>Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, ''The Doctrine and Methods of the Democratic Party of Guinea'', Imprimerie Nationale Patrice Lumumba, Conakry, 1967, quoted in Mohamed Saliou Camara, \u2018From Military Politization to Militarization of Power in Guinea-Conakry\u2019, ''Journal of Political and Military Sociology'', Vol.28, No. 2, 2000. ({{ISSN|0047-2697}}) 2000.</ref>\n\nThe militia was re-titled the National and Popular Militia in 1974 and its regular section scaled down, as the President announced that the country could not afford the large standing force that he believed was necessary to deter what he saw as the constant threat of invasion.<ref>Nelson et al 1975, p.339-340, seemingly drawing on U.S. Department of Commerce translations of articles in the PDG newspaper Horoya, 1974, made available through the Joint Publications Research Service.</ref>  The militia was re-organised in multiple tiers, with a staff in Conakry, some combat units, and the remainder of the permanent element serving as a cadre for reserve militia units in villages, industrial sites, and schools.\n\nThe permanent cadre was to circulate among the villages, spending three months in each one, to train the local militia. President Tour\u00e9 announced that the ultimate goal was to have a 100-strong paramilitary unit in each of the country's 4,000 villages. Infantry weapons of Soviet manufacture imported from the USSR, Czechoslovakia and the PRC were to be issued as they became available.\n\nWith much focus on the militia, Tour\u00e9 kept much of the armed forces in poverty. The [[International Crisis Group]] said that '..conditions of service were deplorable, even for officers. The senior officer corps lived on meagre rations and saw its privileges and family allowances curtailed over time. Soldiers of all ranks had to find ways to supplement their rations and were often reduced to working either on state farms or in small agricultural projects.'<ref>On this period, Crisis Group interviews, colonel and former member of the Comit\u00e9s d'Unit\u00e9 Militaire (CUM), Kindia, May 2010; retired military officer, Conakry, February 2010.

Yet on the other side of the border the Guinean government also contributed troops to the ill-fated ECOWAS peacekeeping force [[ECOMOG]] in Liberia. After ECOMOG departed in 1997-98, the Guinean government began supporting the new Liberian rebel movement [[LURD]]. Attacks by Taylor-backed rebels in 2000-01 were partially an attempt to stop this support.\n\nMore serious was a 1996 attempted coup that originated as a military mutiny caused by the armed forces\u2019 poor living conditions. Cont\u00e9, \u2018civilianised\u2019 since a rigged election in 1993, had to make significant concessions in order to save his regime. Cont\u00e9 appointed his first civilian Minister of Defense in 1997.<ref>[https://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/g/6858.htm State Department Background Notes]</ref>\n\nThe military was used three times in 2006-2007 to suppress popular protest: in June 2006, resulting in 16 deaths, on 22 January 2007, when it fired on protesters at the 9 November Bridge in Conakry, killing over 100, and on 9 February 2007, when it killed several more protesters.<ref>ICG, 2010, p.8</ref>\n\nThe military suffered serious [[2008 Guinean military unrest|unrest in 2008]]. Among measures taken by Conte to try and shore up his support within the military after 2007 was the transfer of the 'popular [[S\u00e9kouba Konat\u00e9]] to Conakry to head the parachute Autonomous Battalion of Airborne Troops (French acronym BATA) in an attempt to calm the troops.'<ref>International Crisis Group, ''Africa Report'' No. 164, 2010, p.8</ref> However, these and other measures failed to stop the [[2008 Guinean coup d'\u00e9tat]] led by [[Moussa Dadis Camara]] in late December 2008.\n\nIn January 2009 a CNDD ordonnance combined four elite units of the Guinean armed forces - the presidential guards, the Bataillon Autonome des Troupes A\u00e9roport\u00e9es (BATA), the Battaillon des Commandos de Kindia (popularly known as the \u2018Commandos Chinois\u2019) and the Battaillon des Rangers - into a combined commando regiment.<ref>Amnesty International</ref>\n\nOn 28 September 2009, in what became known as the 'Bloody Monday' massacre/[[2009 Guinea protest]], [[Amnesty International]] said that Guinea security forces killed more than 150 people and raped over 40 women during and following the protests.<ref>https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/reform-security-forces-guinea-must-deliver-justice-bloody-monday-massacre-20</ref> More than 1,500 people were wounded and many people went missing or were detained.

[[Lu\u00eds Cabral]], Am\u00edlcar Cabral's half-brother, became President of Guinea-Bissau. Following independence local soldiers that fought along with the [[Portuguese Army]] against the [[PAIGC]] guerrillas were slaughtered by the thousands. A small number escaped to Portugal or to other African nations. The most famous massacre occurred in [[Bissor\u00e3]]. In 1980 PAIGC admitted in its newspaper \"N\u00f3 Pintcha\" (dated 29 November 1980) that many were executed and buried in unmarked collective graves in the woods of Cumer\u00e1, Portogole and Mansab\u00e1. In late 1980, the government was overthrown in a relatively bloodless coup led by Prime Minister and former armed forces commander [[Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira]]. {{cn|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe United States recognised Guinea Bissau's independence on 10 September 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/countries/guinea-bissau|title=A GUIDE TO THE UNITED STATES' HISTORY OF RECOGNITION, DIPLOMATIC, AND CONSULAR RELATIONS, BY COUNTRY, SINCE 1776: GUINEA-BISSAU|work=[[Office of the Historian]]|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|accessdate=14 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Democracy==\nIn 1994, 20 years after independence from Portugal, the country's first multiparty legislative and presidential elections were held. An army uprising that triggered the [[Guinea-Bissau Civil War]] in 1998, created hundreds of thousands of displaced persons. The president was ousted by a military junta on 7 May 1999. An interim government turned over power in February 2000 when opposition leader [[Kumba Ial\u00e1]] took office following two rounds of transparent presidential elections. Guinea-Bissau's transition back to democracy has been complicated by a crippled economy devastated by civil war and the military's predilection for governmental meddling. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nDespite reports that there had been an influx of arms in the weeks leading up to the election and reports of some 'disturbances during campaigning' - including attacks on the presidential palace and the Interior Ministry by as-yet-unidentified gunmen - [[Election monitoring|European monitors]] labelled the election as \"calm and organized\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4723627.stm BBC News]</ref>\n\nIn January 2000, the second round of [[Guinea-Bissau general election, 1999\u20132000|a general election]] took place. The presidential election resulted in a victory for opposition leader [[Kumba Ial\u00e1]] of the [[Party for Social Renewal]] (PRS), who defeated [[Malam Bacai Sanh\u00e1]] of the ruling [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC]]. The PRS were also victorious in the [[National People's Assembly of Guinea-Bissau|National People's Assembly]] election, winning 38 of the 102 seats.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Politics of Guinea-Bissau]]\n*[[United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in Guinea-Bissau]] ('''UNOGBIS''')\n* City of Bissau [[Bissau#History|history]] and [[Timeline of Bissau|timeline]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5454.htm Background Note: Guinea-Bissau]\n\n{{Years in Guinea-Bissau}}\n{{Guinea-Bissau topics}}\n{{History of Africa}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Guinea-Bissau}}\n[[Category:History of Guinea-Bissau| ]]", "sha1": "mwvlpht5ewm7a23t9os6fqcqy2ensfc"}}, {"title": "Geography of Guinea-Bissau", "ns": "0", "id": "12188", "revision": {"id": "865576995", "parentid": "865576965", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T19:39:55Z", "contributor": {"username": "TOPITIT", "id": "33946039"}, "comment": "/* Information from the CIA World Factbook */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Un-guinea-bissau.png|thumb|550px|A map of Guinea Bissau]]\t\n[[File:LocationGuineaBissau.svg|thumb|Location of Guinea Bissau]]\n\nThis article describes the '''geography of [[Guinea-Bissau]]'''.\n\n== Terrain and ecology ==\n[[Image:Guinea-Bissau Topography.png|thumb|350px|Guinea-Bissau's topography.]]\t\n\nThe terrain of Guinea-Bissau is mostly low coastal plain with swamps of [[Guinean mangroves]] rising to [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] in the east.<ref name=fact />\n\nThe lowest point on Guinea-Bissau is at sea level at the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=\"fact\"/> The highest point on Guinea-Bissau is 300 metres above sea level at an unnamed location in the eastern part of the country.<ref name=\"fact\"/>\n\nNatural resources found in Guinea-Bissau include fish, [[timber]], [[phosphates]], [[bauxite]], clay, [[granite]], limestone and unexploited deposits of [[petroleum]].<ref name=\"fact\"/> 10.67% of the land is arable and 235.6 square kilometres is irrigated.<ref name=\"fact\"/>\n\nNatural hazards include a hot, dry, dusty [[harmattan]] haze that may reduce visibility during the dry season and brush fires.<ref name=\"fact\"/> Severe environmental issues include [[deforestation]]; [[soil erosion]]; [[overgrazing]] and [[overfishing]].<ref name=\"fact\"/>\n\nNear the Senegal border there have been historic sightings of the [[painted hunting dog]], ''Lycaon pictus'', but that [[endangered]] canid may now be [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in that locale.<ref>C.

Most Guineans, 99%, are Blacks &mdash; mostly [[Fula language|Fula]] and [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]]-speakers concentrated in the north and northeast, the [[Balanta people|Balanta]] and Papel, living in the southern coastal regions, and the [[Manjak people|Manjaco]] and Mancanha, occupying the central and northern coastal areas. \n\nMost of the rest are ''[[mestizo|mesti\u00e7os]]'' of mixed [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and black descent, including [[Cape Verde]]an minority. Due to the exodus of most Portuguese settlers after independence, less than 1% of Guinea-Bissauans are pure Portuguese. The country also has a [[overseas Chinese|Chinese]] minority, including [[Macanese people]] of mixed Portuguese and Chinese blood from [[Macau]]. \n\nMost people are farmers. 38%-45% are [[Muslim]]s - this makes Guinea-Bissau the only Portuguese-speaking nation with a sizable Muslim population. Most Muslims are [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]]. The rest of the population are [[animism|pagans]], principally the [[Balanta people|Balanta]], and [[Christianity|Christians]], mostly [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]].\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Pyramide Guinee-Bissau.PNG|thumb|450px|Guinea-Bissau's [[population pyramid]], 2005.

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[National People's Assembly of Guinea-Bissau|National People's Assembly]].\n\nSince 1994 the party system has been dominated by the socialist [[African Independence Party of Guinea and Cape Verde]] and the [[Party for Social Renewal]].  The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nDespite the democratic, constitutional framework, the military has exercised substantial power and interfered repeatedly in civilian leadership since multi-party elections were instituted in 1994.  In the past 16 years, Guinea Bissau has experienced two coups, a civil war, an attempted coup, and a presidential assassination by the military.  Since the country's independence in 1974, no president has successfully served a full five-year term.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pu.html CIA Factbook: Guinea-Bissau] \"Introduction\"</ref>\n\n== Political developments ==\n[[File:Pal%C3%A1cio_da_Rep%C3%BAblica_(fundos).jpg|thumb|300px|Guinea-Bissau's Presidential palace in the capital [[Bissau]].]]\nIn [[Guinea-Bissau]] in 1989, the ruling [[African Independence Party of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) under the direction of President [[Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira|Jo\u00e3o Bernardo \"Nino\" Vieira]] began to outline a political liberalization program which the [[People's National Assembly of Guinea-Bissau|People's National Assembly]] approved in 1991. Reforms that paved the way for multi-party democracy included the repeal of articles of the constitution, which had enshrined the leading role of the PAIGC. Laws were ratified to allow the formation of other political parties, a free press, and independent trade unions with the right to strike.\n\nGuinea-Bissau's first [[multi-party system|multi-party]] [[election]]s for president and parliament were held in 1994.  Following the [[Guinea-Bissau Civil War|1998-99 civil war]], presidential and legislative elections were again held, bringing opposition leader [[Kumba Ial\u00e1]] and his [[Party for Social Renewal]] to power.  Ial\u00e1 was ousted in a bloodless coup in September 2003 and [[Henrique Rosa]] was sworn in as President.\n\nFormer President Viera was once again elected as President in July 2005.  The government of Prime Minister Carlos Gomes J\u00fanior was elected in March 2004 in a free and fair election round, but was replaced by the government of Prime Minister Aristides Gomes which took office already in November 2005. Aristides Gomes lost a no-confidence vote and submitted his resignation in March 2007.\n\nMartinho Ndafa Kabi was proposed as prime minister by a coalition composed of the PAIGC, the Social Renewal Party (PRS), and the United Social Democratic Party (PUSD). On April 9, it was announced that President Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira had rejected the choice of Kabi, but the coalition said that they maintained him as their choice and later on the same day, Vieira appointed Kabi as the new prime minister. He took office on April 13, and his government, composed of 20 ministers (including eight from the PAIGC, eight from the PRS, and two from the PUSD) was named on April 17.\n\n===2009 assassination===\nPresident Viera was reported killed on March 2, 2009 by soldiers as retaliation for the killing of the head of the joint chiefs of staff, General [[Tagme Na Waie]], who was killed the previous day.\n\n===2010 military unrest===\n{{main|2010 Guinea-Bissau military unrest}}\nPrior to the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2008#Chronology|2008 election]], a decision to change the electoral date and extend the parliamentary mandate resulted in major controversy when the Assembly deputies snubbed the president and chose to extend their mandate. After the Supreme Court annulled that law, President Vieira dissolved the Assembly, thus allowing the standing committee to continue working, and appointed a new government composed of loyalists.\n\n[[Rear Admiral]] Bubo Na Tchuto tried to organize a coup on August 7, 2008, but was pre-empted and arrested; however, he managed to escape the country. The attempted coup added to instability ahead of parliamentary elections. Gambia subsequently arrested Bubo Na Tchuto.<ref>http://www.zimbio.com/President+Joao+Bernardo+Vieira/articles/9/Rear+Admiral+Jose+Americo+Bubo+Na+Tchuto+alleged</ref> He later returned to Guinea-Bissau disguised as a fisherman and took refuge at a UN compound. Although the UN agreed to surrender him to the government, he continued to reside in the compound. As a result of his return security in the country was tightened, contributing to uncertainty and instability.\n\nOn April 1, 2010, soldiers entered UN offices and left with Bubo Na Tchuto. The same day, soldiers entered Prime Minister [[Carlos Gomes J\u00fanior]]'s residence and held him on the premises. Simultaneously, forty military officers, including Zamora Induta, head of Guinea-Bissau's armed forces, were being held at an army base. Hundreds of the PM's supporters demanded his release. In response, the deputy army chief, Antonio Ndjai, said: \"If the people continue to go out into the streets to show their support for Carlos Gomes Junior, then I will kill Carlos Gomes Junior ... or I will send someone to kill him.\"<ref>http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/04/20104112510170361.html</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/04/02/Guinear.Bissau.democracy/ | work=CNN | title=Leaders call on Guinea-Bissau to maintain democracy | date=2 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe following day the PM was taken to meet with the president where he said: \"I will not resign because I was democratically elected.

License fees for fishing provide the government with some revenue.  [[Rice]] is the major crop and staple food.\n\n==Economic history==\n\n===Early colonialism===\n{{main|Portuguese Guinea|Economic history of Portugal}}\n[[Image:Portugueseguineacompanyflag.svg|thumb|140px|left|The flag of the [[Company of Guinea|Guinea Company]], a Portuguese company that traded in several commodities and slaves around the Guinea coast from the 15th century.]]\nFrom a European viewpoint, the economic history of the Guinea Coast is largely associated with slavery. Indeed, one of the alternative names for the region was the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]. When the Portuguese first sailed down the Atlantic coast of Africa in the 1430s, they were interested in [[gold]]. Ever since [[Musa I of Mali|Mansa Musa]], king of the [[Mali Empire]], made his pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] in 1325, with 500 slaves and 100 camels (each carrying gold) the region had become synonymous with such wealth. The trade from [[sub-Saharan Africa]] was controlled by the [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] which stretched along Africa's northern coast. Muslim trade routes across the [[Sahara]], which had existed for centuries, involved salt, [[kola nut|kola]], textiles, fish, grain and slaves.<ref>[[Bill Epstein|A.L. Epstein]], Urban Communities in Africa - Closed Systems and Open Minds, 1964</ref>\n\nAs the Portuguese extended their influence around the coast, [[Mauritania]], [[Senegambia]] (by 1445) and [[Guinea]], they created [[trading post]]s. Rather than becoming direct competitors to the Muslim merchants, the expanding market opportunities in Europe and the Mediterranean resulted in increased trade across the Sahara.<ref>B.W. Hodder, Some Comments on the Origins of Traditional Markets in Africa South of the Sahara - Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 1965 - JSTOR</ref> In addition, the Portuguese merchants gained access to the interior via the [[S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River|S\u00e9n\u00e9gal]] and [[Gambia River|Gambia]] rivers which bisected long-standing trans-Saharan routes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">H. Miner, The City in Modern Africa - 1967</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese brought in [[copper]] ware, cloth, tools, wine and horses. Trade goods soon also included arms and ammunition. In exchange, the Portuguese received gold (transported from mines of the [[Akan people|Akan]] deposits), [[Black pepper|pepper]] (a trade which lasted until [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India in 1498) and [[ivory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThere was a very small market for African slaves as domestic workers in Europe, and as workers on the sugar plantations of the Mediterranean. The Portuguese found they could make considerable amounts of gold transporting slaves from one trading post to another, along the Atlantic coast of Africa. Muslim merchants had a high demand for slaves, which were used as porters on the [[trans-Saharan route]]s, and for sale in the Islamic Empire. The Portuguese found Muslim merchants entrenched along the African coast as far as the [[Bight of Benin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBefore the arrival of the Europeans, the [[African slave trade]], centuries old in Africa, was not yet the major feature of the coastal economy of Guinea. The expansion of trade occurs after the Portuguese reach this region in 1446, bringing great wealth to several local slave trading tribes. The Portuguese used slave labour to colonize and develop the previously uninhabited [[Cape Verde]] islands where they founded settlements and grew [[cotton]] and [[indigo]]. They then traded these goods, in the estuary of the [[Geba River]], for black slaves captured by other black peoples in local African wars and raids.\n\nThe slaves were sold in Europe and, from the 16th century, in the [[Americas]]. The [[Company of Guinea]] was a Portuguese governative institution whose task was to deal with the [[spice]]s and to fix the prices of the goods. It was called ''Casa da Guin\u00e9'', ''Casa da Guin\u00e9 e Mina'' from 1482 to 1483 and ''Casa da \u00cdndia e da Guin\u00e9'' in 1499. The local African rulers in Guinea, who prosper greatly from the slave trade, have no interest in allowing the Europeans any further inland than the fortified coastal settlements where the trading takes place. The Portuguese presence in Guinea was therefore largely limited to the port of [[Bissau]].\n\n===Colonial era===\n\nAs with the other Portuguese territories in mainland Africa ([[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]]), Portugal exercised control over the coastal areas of Portuguese Guinea when first laying claim to the whole region as a colony. For three decades there are costly and continuous campaigns to suppress the local African rulers. By 1915 this process was complete, enabling Portuguese colonial rule to progress in a relatively unruffled state - until the emergence of nationalist movements all over Africa in the 1950s.\n\nFor a brief period in the 1790s the British attempted to establish a rival foothold on an offshore island, at [[Bolama]], but by the 19th century the Portuguese were sufficiently secure in Bissau to regard the neighbouring coastline as their own special territory. It was therefore natural for Portugal to lay claim to this region, soon to be known as Portuguese Guinea, when the European [[scramble for Africa]] began in the 1880s. Britain's interest in the region declined since the end of the British slave trade in 1807. After the abolition of slavery in the Portuguese overseas territories in the 1830s, the slave trade went into serious decline.\n\nPortugal's main rival were the French, their colonial neighbours along the coast on both sides - in [[Senegal]] and in the region which became [[French Guinea]]. The Portuguese presence in Guinea was not disputed by the French. The only point at issue was the precise line of the borders. This was established by agreement between the two colonial powers in two series of negotiations, in 1886 and 1902-5. Until the end of the 19th century, [[rubber]] was the main export.\n\n===As an overseas province===\nIn 1951, when the Portuguese government overhauled the entire colonial system, all Portugal's colonies, including Portuguese Guinea, were renamed Overseas Provinces (''Prov\u00edncias Ultramarinas''). New infrastructures were built for education, health, agriculture, transportation, commerce, services, and administration.\n\n[[Cashew]], [[peanut]], [[rice]], [[timber]], [[livestock]] and fish were the main economic productions. The port of Bissau was one of the main employers and a very important source of taxes for the province's authorities.\n\n====Independence war====\nThe fight for independence began in 1956, when [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]] founded the ''[[Partido Africano da Independ\u00eancia da Guin\u00e9 e Cabo Verde]]'' ({{lang-pt|African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde}}), the PAIGC. In 1961, when a purely political campaign for independence had made predictably little progress, the PAIGC adopted [[guerrilla]] tactics. Although heavily outnumbered by Portuguese troops (approximately 30,000 Portuguese to some 10,000 guerrillas), the PAIGe had the great advantage of safe havens over the border in [[Senegal]] and [[Guinea]], both recently independent of French rule.\n\nSeveral communist countries supported the guerrillas with weapons and military training. The conflict in [[Portuguese Guinea]] involving the PAIGC guerrillas and the [[Portuguese Army]] was the most intense and damaging of all [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. Thus, during the 1960s and early 1970s, Portuguese development plans promoting strong economic growth and effective socioeconomic policies, like those applied by the Portuguese in the other two theaters of war ([[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]]), were not possible. In 1972 Cabral sets up a government in exile in [[Conakry]], the capital of neighbouring [[Guinea]]. It was there, in 1973, that he was assassinated outside his house - just a year before a [[Carnation Revolution|left-wing military coup in Portugal]] dramatically altered the political situation.\n\nBy 1973 the PAIGC controlled most of the interior of the country, while the coastal and estuary towns, including the main populational and economic centres remained under Portuguese control. The village of [[Madina do Bo\u00e9]] in the southeasternmost area of the territory, close to the border with neighbouring [[Guinea]], was the location where PAIGC guerrillas declared the independence of Guinea-Bissau on September 24, 1973. The war in the colonies was increasingly unpopular in Portugal itself as the people got weary of war and balked at its ever-rising expense. Following the [[Carnation Revolution|coup d'\u00e9tat in Portugal in 1974]], the new [[Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas|left-wing revolutionary government of Portugal]] began to negotiate with the PAIGC and decided to offer independence to all the overseas territories.\n\n===After independence===\nAs his brother [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]] had been assassinated in 1973, [[Lu\u00eds Cabral]] became the first president of independent Guinea-Bissau in the time after independence was granted on September 10, 1974. Already as the President of Guinea-Bissau, Lu\u00eds Cabral tried to impose a [[planned economy]] in the country, and supported a [[socialist]] model that left the economy of Guinea-Bissau itself ruined. Similarly, the repression the authoritarian single-party regime<ref>[http://www.ipri.pt/artigos/artigo.php?ida=104 Widening trajectories: Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde since independence, Norrie MacQueen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423212017/http://www.ipri.pt/artigos/artigo.php?ida=104 |date=April 23, 2015 }}</ref> he led imposed on the population and severe food shortages also left marks and, despite having always denied, Lu\u00eds Cabral was accused of being responsible for the death of a large number of black Guinea-Bissauan soldiers who had fought along with the [[Portuguese Army]] against the PAIGC guerrillas during the [[Portuguese Colonial War]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=O313hgXUedsC&pg=PA237&dq=lu%C3%ADs+cabral+guinea A history of postcolonial Lusophone Africa], A history of postcolonial Lusophone Africa, [[Patrick Chabal]], Edition: C.

After the military coup, in 1980 PAIGC admitted in its official newspaper \"N\u00f3 Pintcha\" (dated November 29, 1980) that many were executed and buried in unmarked collective graves in the woods of Cumer\u00e1, Portogole and Mansab\u00e1. All these events did not help the new-country to reach the level of prosperity, economic growth and development the new rulers had promised to its population.\n\n== Present day ==\n\n===Macro-economic trend===\n\n[[File:Guinea-Bissau Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|350px|A proportional representation of Guinea-Bissau's exports.]]\nFollowing the April 2012 coup d'\u00c9tat growth plundged to reach -1.5% of GDP. In 2013, the country's GDP grew only by 0.9%. This low growth level during a period of democratic transition is explained by a combination of low administrative efficiency, low investments on account of the political instability and a bad cashew export season.<ref name=\":1\" /> Key macroeconomic indicators estimated by the [[African Development Bank]] are presented in the chart below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Real GDP growth\n!2013\n!2014 (estimate)\n!2015 (projection)\n!2016 (projection)\n|-\n|Real GDP per capita growth\n|0.9\n|2.6\n|3.9\n|3.7\n|-\n|Real GDP per capita growth\n| -1.5\n|0.2\n|1.6\n|1.3\n|-\n|Budget balance % GDP\n| -1.4\n| -2.1\n| -3.9\n| -3.4\n|-\n|Current account balance % GDP\n| -4.1\n| -0.5\n| -0.8\n| -1.2\n|}\nIntermittent fighting between [[Senegal]]ese-backed government troops and a military junta destroyed much of the country's [[infrastructure]] and caused widespread damage to the economy in 1998; the civil war led to a 28% drop in GDP that year, with partial recovery in 1999.  Agricultural production is estimated to have fallen by 17% during the conflict, and the civil war led to a 28% overall drop in GDP in 1998. Cashew nut output, the main export crop, declined in 1998 by an estimated 30%. World cashew prices dropped by more than 50% in 2000, compounding the economic devastation caused by the conflict.\n\nBefore the war, trade reform and price liberalization were the most successful part of the country's [[structural adjustment]] program under IMF sponsorship. The tightening of monetary policy and the development of the private sector had also begun to reinvigorate the economy. Under the government\u2019s post-conflict economic and financial program, implemented with IMF and World Bank input, real GDP recovered in 1999 by almost 8%. In December 2000 Guinea-Bissau qualified for almost $800 million in debt-service relief under the first phase of the enhanced [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries|HIPC]] initiative and is scheduled to submit its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper in March 2002. Guinea-Bissau will receive the bulk of its assistance under the enhanced HIPC initiative when it satisfies a number of conditions, including implementation of its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.\n\nBecause of high costs, the development of [[petroleum]], [[phosphate]], and other [[mineral]] resources is not a near-term prospect.

The FAGB was re-equipped by the Soviet Union with a limited aid package in which its first combat aircraft were introduced. Five MIG-17s and two MiG-15UTI trainers entered service with a single Mi-8 helicopter.\n\nIn 1978 France provided more aircraft aid in the form of a Reims-cessna FTB.337 for coastal patrol and a surplus Alouette III.  A Dassault Falcon 20F was donated by the Angolan government but was soon sold to the USA. In the late 1980s a similar number of MiG 21s replaced the MiG 17s, also delivered an AN-24, a YAK-40 and another Mi-8 helicopter.

The president is not directly elected; each party presenting a slate of candidates for the assembly must designate in advance a leader who will become president if that party receives the largest number of votes. The president has the authority to dissolve the parliament, but in contrast to a parliamentary regime, the Constitution of Guyana does not provide any mechanism for parliament to replace the president during his or her term of office, except in case of mental incapacity or gross constitutional violations. This makes Guyana an \"assembly-independent\" regime, much like Switzerland.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shugart |first1=Matthew S\u00f8berg |last2=Carey |first2=John M. |title=Presidents and Assemblies: Constitutional Design and Electoral Dynamics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMuFhQ75b64C&printsec=frontcover&dq=John+Carey/Matthew+Soberg+Shugart,+Presidents+and+Assemblies.+Constitutional+Design+and+Electoral+Dynamics,+Cambridge+1992 |location=Cambridge University |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page= |date=October 1992 |isbn=9780521429900 }}</ref>\n\nOnly the prime minister is required to be a member of the assembly. In practice, most other ministers also are members. Those who are not serve as non-elected members, which permits them to debate but not to vote. The president is not a member of the National Assembly but may Address it at any time or have his address read by any member he may designate at convenient time for the Assembly. Under Guyana's constitution the President is both the head of state and head of government of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana.\n\n== Legislative branch ==\n[[File:Parliament building, Guyana.jpg|thumb|[[Parliament of Guyana]] in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]].]]\n[[Legislative]] power of [[Guyana]] rests in a [[unicameral]] National Assembly. In 2001 the makeup of the National Assembly was reformed. Now 25 members are elected via proportional representation from 10 Geographic Constituencies. Additionally 40 members are chosen also on the basis of proportional representation from National lists named by the [[political parties]].\nThe [[president]] may dissolve the assembly and call new elections at any time, but no later than 5 years from its first sitting.\n\n== Political parties and elections ==\n{{elect|List of political parties in Guyana|Elections in Guyana}}\n\n== Judicial branch ==\nThe highest [[judicial]] body is the [[Court]] of Appeal, headed by a chancellor of the [[judiciary]]. The second level is the [[High Court (Guyana)|High Court]], presided over by a [[chief justice]]. The chancellor and the chief justice are appointed by the president.  The [http://www.audit.org.gy Audit Office of Guyana (AOG)] is the country's Supreme Audit Institution (SAI).\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nFor administrative purposes, Guyana is divided into 10 regions, each headed by a chairman who presides over a regional democratic council. Local communities are administered by village or city councils. The regions are [[Barima-Waini]], [[Cuyuni-Mazaruni]], [[Demerara-Mahaica]], [[East Berbice-Corentyne]], [[Essequibo Islands-West Demerara]], [[Mahaica-Berbice]], [[Pomeroon-Supenaam]], [[Potaro-Siparuni]], [[Upper Demerara-Berbice]] and [[Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo]].\n\n== Political conditions ==\n[[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]] and [[ideology]] have been the dominant political influences in Guyana. Since the split of the multiracial PPP in 1955, politics has been based more on [[ethnicity]] than on [[ideology]]. From 1964 to 1992, the PNC dominated Guyana's politics.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Guyanese of East Indian extraction traditionally have backed the People's Progressive Party, headed by the Jagans. [[Rice]] [[farmer]]s and [[sugar]] workers in the [[rural]] areas form the bulk of PPP's support, but Indo-Guyanese who dominate the country's urban [[business]] community also have provided important support.\n\nFollowing independence, and with the help of substantial foreign aid, social benefits were provided to a broader section of the population, specifically in [[health]], [[education]], [[house|housing]], road and bridge building, [[agriculture]], and rural development. However, during [[Forbes Burnham]]'s last years, the government's attempts to build a socialist society caused a massive emigration of skilled workers, and, along with other economic factors, led to a significant decline in the overall quality of life in Guyana.\n\nAfter Burnham's death in 1985, President Hoyte took steps to stem the economic decline, including strengthening financial controls over the parastatal corporations and supporting the private sector. In August 1987, at a PNC Congress, Hoyte announced that the PNC rejected orthodox communism and the one-party state.\n\nAs the elections scheduled for 1990 approached, Hoyte, under increasing pressure from inside and outside Guyana, gradually opened the political system. After a visit to Guyana by former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1990, Hoyte made changes in the electoral rules, appointed a new chairman of the Elections Commission, and endorsed putting together new voters' lists, thus delaying the election. The elections, which finally took place in 1992, were witnessed by 100 international observers, including a group headed by Carter and another from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Both groups issued reports saying that the elections had been free and fair, despite violent attacks on the Elections Commission building on election day and other irregularities.\n\n[[Cheddi Jagan]] served as Premier (1957&ndash;1964) and then minority leader in Parliament until his election as President in 1992. One of the [[Caribbean]]'s most charismatic and famous leaders, Jagan was a founder of the PPP which led Guyana's struggle for independence. Over the years, he moderated his [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] [[ideology]]. After his election as President, Jagan demonstrated a commitment to democracy, followed a pro-Western foreign policy, adopted [[free market]] policies, and pursued sustainable development for Guyana's environment. Nonetheless, he continued to press for debt relief and a new global human order in which developed countries would increase assistance to less developed nations. Jagan died on 6 March 1997, and was succeeded by [[Sam Hinds]], whom he had appointed Prime Minister. President Hinds then appointed [[Janet Jagan]], [[widow]] of the late President, to serve as Prime Minister.\n\nIn [[Guyanese legislative election, 1997|national elections]] on 15 December 1997, Janet Jagan was elected President, and her PPP party won a 55% majority of seats in Parliament. She was sworn in on 19 December. Jagan was a founding member of the PPP and was very active in party politics. She was Guyana's first female prime minister and vice president, two roles she performed concurrently before being elected to the presidency. She was also unique in being white, Jewish and a naturalized citizen (born in the [[United States]]).\n\nThe PNC, which won just under 40% of the vote, disputed the results of the 1997 elections, alleging electoral fraud. Public demonstrations and some violence followed, until a CARICOM team came to Georgetown to broker an accord between the two parties, calling for an international audit of the election results, a redrafting of the constitution, and elections under the constitution within 3 years. Elections took place on 19 March 2001.  Over 150 international observers representing six international missions witnessed the polling.  The observers pronounced the elections fair and open although marred by some administrative problems.\n\nThe [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] rated Guyana as \"[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|flawed democracy]]\" in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016|title=Democracy Index 2016 - The Economist Intelligence Unit|last=solutions|first=EIU digital|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\n== Territorial disputes ==\nAll of the area west of the [[Essequibo River]] is claimed by Venezuela, preventing any discussion of a [[maritime boundary]]; Guyana has expressed its intention to join Barbados in asserting claims before [[UNCLOS]] that Trinidad and Tobago's maritime boundary with Venezuela extends into their waters; Suriname claims a triangle of land between the New and Kutari/Koetari rivers in a historic dispute over the headwaters of the Corentyne; the long-standing dispute with Suriname over the axis of the territorial sea boundary in potentially oil-rich waters has been resolved by [[UNCLOS]] with Guyana awarded 93% of the disputed territory.\n\n== International organization participation ==\nGuyana is a full and participating founder-member of the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]], the headquarters of which is located in Georgetown.

This arrangement extends to all mini bus routes throughout the country. There are designated bus stops for mini buses for most routes but some buses still pick up passengers at virtually any point on their routes. This practice often poses a serious inconvenience to other vehicles by disrupting the normal flow of traffic.\n\nTaxis have freer movement around the city and into rural areas. Their fare, while generally standard, is less regulated. Starting in 2010, all taxis must be painted yellow, a regulation designed to protect consumers and to distinguish the vehicles from others that are often used in committing crimes. All taxis are registered under the term \"Hackney Carriage\" and carry the letter H at the beginning of their number plates. There are scores of taxi services operating in Georgetown but its equally easy to \"flag a ride\" in the central business district.\n\nThe network of routes has a number of identifiable starting points which are concentrated in the Stabroek area and along the Avenue of the Republic between Croal and Robb Streets.\n\nRoad conditions vary immensely, and maintenance is sometimes deficient.  In 2006 there was one operational set of traffic lights but in July 2007, a modern system was installed by Indian firm CMS Traffic Systems Limited, through a US$2.1 million line of credit to the government from India's EXIM Bank, providing signals for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic at all major intersections in Georgetown.<ref>Stabroek News - [http://www.stabroeknews.com/2010/news/stories/10/14/key-traffic-lights-on-the-blink-again/ Ket traffic lights on the blink again]</ref>\n\n==Long distance transportation==\n\n===Roads<ref>https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2015/03/21/in-pursuit-of-roads-in-guyana/</ref><ref>[http://www.guyana.org/gazetteer.pdf  Place names along Guyana's roads]</ref><ref>http://www.visualgeography.com/categories/guyana/streets.html</ref>===\n[[Image:Soesdyke-Linden Highway.jpg|thumb|The [[Soesdyke-Linden Highway]] tends to serve the mining and forestry sectors.]]\nIn 2004, Guyana's road network was approximately {{convert|3,995|km|mi|sp=us}} long, 24 percent or 940 kilometers of which comprised primary roads in the coastal and riverine areas serving the agricultural sector, while the [[Soesdyke-Linden Highway|road]] to [[Linden, Guyana|Linden]] serves the mining and forestry sectors. 21 percent (820 kilometers) is made up of feeder roads that link the agricultural areas along the coast to the primary road network. The remaining 56 percent (2,235 kilometers) is composed of interior roads and trails. Most access roads are in poor condition. However, the Central Government has targeted several roads for complete rehabilitation, and already many have been rehabilitated.\n\nThe main coastal roads are, from west to east, the Essequibo Coast Road, the [[Parika]] to [[Vreed en Hoop]] Road, the East Coast Demerara and West Coast Berbice Roads, and the Corentyne Highway from [[New Amsterdam, Guyana|New Amsterdam]] to [[Moleson Creek]] (86 kilometers). All these roads are paved and their speed limit vary between 50-100kph.\n\nSouth of Georgetown the primary road is the East Bank Demerara Road, a four-lane road from Rumiveldt to Providence and two-lane from Providence to Timehri Georgetown to Timehri, where the [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport]] - Timehri (CJIAT) is located.\n\nBetween 1966 and 1968, Soesdyke, located on the East Bank Demerara Road, was connected to Mackenzie by a modern two lane highway, called the [[Soesdyke-Linden Highway]]. This road was constructed as a section of a highway connecting Georgetown with [[Lethem, Guyana|Lethem]]. In 1968 a bridge was built across the [[Demerara River]] at [[Linden, Guyana|Linden]], and, in 1974, it was decided that the route to Lethem would cross the Demerara River at Linden and go south, along the watershed of the Demerara and Essequibo Rivers, through [[Mabura]], to [[Kurupukari]]. From Kurupukari it would run parallel to the old cattle trail to [[Annai, Guyana|Annai]], and from Annai it would follow an already existing road to Lethem.\n\n[[Image:Mabura Road after leaving Linden.jpg|thumb|Mabura Road south of Linden]]In the early 1970s a two-lane road with modern geometry and surfaced with [[laterite]] was built between Linden and [[Rockstone]]. This road was later connected to Mabura and Kurupukari. In 1990-91 a two-lane laterite road was constructed between Kurupukari and Annai and a vehicle ferry installed at Kurupukari. Since there was already an existing road between Mabura and Kurupukari, and between Annai and Lethem, it was now possible for vehicles to travel between Georgetown and Lethem.\n\nIn the period 1974 to 1978, an attempt was made to build a road between Rockstone and [[Kurupung]] to facilitate the construction of a large hydroelectric station. From Rockstone it headed north to Suribanna, where a pontoon ferry was installed across the Essequibo River to Sherima. From Sherima the road went westward, intersecting the Bartica - Mahdia Road at Allsopp Point {{convert|19|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from [[Bartica]]. From Allsopp Point the road followed the existing road towards Bartica and branched off {{convert|5|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|0}} from Bartica going to Teperu in the lower reaches on the Mazaruni River. At Teperu a pontoon ferry was installed across the Mazaruni River to Itaballi. From Itaballi the road went westward to Peter's Mine on the Puruni River. From Peter's Mine the road continued as a penetration road to Kurupung. This road is referred to as the UMDA Road.\n\nThere is in addition a hinterland east-west main road system that extends from [[Kwakwani]] in the east, through Ituni, Linden, Rockstone, Sherima to Bartica in the west. Linden is therefore one of the main hubs for road transportation in the hinterland.\n\nOutside the existing main roads there are several other interior roads or trails that comprise approximately 1,570 kilometers. Most of those roads are unpaved, and will deteriorate if maintenance remains inadequate. They are found mostly in the hinterland and riverain areas and provide linkages with a number of important mining and forestry activities thus facilitating transportation between the mining and forestry communities and the more developed coastal areas. Parts of this road/trail network can be developed into an arterial road system linking the hinterland communities with each other and to the main road network. It is estimated that roads carry 80 percent of Guyana's passenger traffic and about 33 percent of its freight.\n\nCommuters to West Demerara have a choice of road transport via the [[Demerara Harbour Bridge]] or by the Demerara River ferry from the Stabroek Stelling to Vreed en Hoop, which is obliquely opposite.\n[[Image:The-new-Mahaicony-bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Mahaicony]] bridge]]\nThe highway that begins on the West Coast of Demerara is heavily trafficked since it provides a link to Parika on the East Bank of the [[Essequibo River]], which has become an important center of economic activity in the Essequibo region.\n\nIt is now possible to travel overland to [[Suriname]] by taking the ferry on the Guyana side at Moleson Creek and crossing the Corentyne River over to Suriname at [[South Drain]]. While travel to [[Brazil]] is via the old cattle trail it has been upgraded into a fair weather track that passes through the bauxite-producing town of Linden and ending at Lethem.\n\n===Bridges===\n[[Image:Demerara Harbour bridge crossing.JPG|thumb|The Demerara Harbour Bridge crosses mouth of the [[Demerara River]]. It is a [[pontoon bridge|floating bridge]].]] The coastal main road system is not continuous. There are gaps whenever it intersects the Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice Rivers. People and goods move across these gaps by ferry systems as well as the [[Demerara Harbour Bridge]] (DHB) and the [[Berbice Bridge]].<ref>[http://opnew.op.gov.gy/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=335%3Apresident-commissions-new-berbice-river-bridge&Itemid=70]</ref>\n\nThe Demerara Harbour Bridge is a two-lane floating toll bridge, {{convert|1.2|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long, near the mouth of the Demerara River. It is primarily a low-level bridge which possesses an elevated span with a vertical clearance of {{convert|26|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} in the middle of the river to permit small craft to pass. In addition, across the shipping channel, there are two spans which retract to permit the passage of ocean-going vessels. From mid-1998 toll revenue has been credited to the account of the DHB and not to the Government of Guyana, as it was until then. This is a step towards the establishment of the DHB as an autonomous statutory authority. At present the toll revenue does not meet the operational and maintenance costs of the bridge; the government of Guyana provides considerable subsidy for its upkeep. The bridge has been in existence since 1978 and currently notwithstanding the rigorous maintenance regime, sits at the end of its useful life.\n\n[[Image:LethemBridge.jpg|thumb|left|Construction continues on a bridge linking Guyana and Brazil at Lethem.]]\n\nIn 2007, construction resumed on the [[Takutu River Bridge]] to link Guyana and Brazil in the southwest region of Guyana near Lethem. The bridge was officially opened on September 14, 2009, enabling economic interests in northern Brazil to link by road to the port at Georgetown. Unprecedented construction and population growth in Lethem since the bridge's opening reflects the significantly increased traffic and movement of goods facilitated by the bridge. The Takutu Bridge is seen as the first of several joint projects between Guyana and Brazil intended to facilitate cargo traffic: Brazil is expected to subsidize the paving of the Lethem-to-Georgetown road, a development that would have profound impacts on the area's economy and environment. Dredging of the Georgetown port to accommodate deeper-draft cargo  vessels is also being planned.\n\n===Rail transport===\nCommercial [[rail transport|railway]] services for both passengers and cargo were operated until 1974. Two lines operated - the [[Demerara-Essequibo Railway]], from Vreed en Hoop to Parika ({{convert|18.5|mi|km|disp=or|order=flip|abbr=on}}) and the [[Demerara-Berbice Railway]], from Georgetown to Rosignol ({{convert|65|mi|km|disp=or|order=flip|abbr=on}}). With the upgrading of the West Coast Demerara/East Bank Essequibo and the East Coast Demerara/West Coast Berbice roadways, the Government decided in the mid-1970s to cease operating the railway services, which were being run at a loss. In the [[Matthew's Ridge]] area, there is a {{convert|32|mi|km|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} railway service.\n\nA railway service was once operated in Linden for the movement of bauxite ore. However trucks are now used to transport the bauxite ore.\n\n====Railway links with adjacent countries====\n* {{flagicon|Venezuela}} [[Rail transport in Venezuela|Venezuela]] - no\n* {{flagicon|Brazil}} [[Rail transport in Brazil|Brazil]] - no\n* {{flagicon|Suriname}} [[Transport in Suriname|Suriname]] - no\n\n==Fluvial transport==\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Portkaituma.jpg|thumb|Coastal caft in [[Port Kaituma]].]] -->\nIt is generally agreed that, for the movement of bulky low-value goods over great distances, water transport is cheapest. This is especially true in Guyana, where the road infrastructure is poorly advanced. Moreover, with the widespread decentralization of economic activity that is being proposed by the government, and with the corresponding development of the interior regions of the country, the demand for water transport might, perhaps paradoxically, increase rather than diminish.\n\nThe infrastructure that supports water transport in Guyana is located along the banks of the navigable rivers, namely, the Essequibo River, Demerara River and Berbice River. In addition to the wharves and stellings that provide coastal and inland linkages, there are facilities that handle both the country's overseas and local shipping requirements.\n\nVirtually all exports and imports are transported by sea. The main port of Georgetown, located at the mouth of the Demerara River, comprises several wharves, most of which are privately owned. In addition, three berths are available for oceangoing vessels at Linden.\n\nDraught constraints limit the size of vessels using Georgetown's harbour to {{DWT|15,000|metric|disp=long}}. However, recent improvements in the channel in the Berbice River have made it possible for ships of up to {{DWT|55,000}} to dock there.\n\nGuyana's foreign trade is handled by foreign shipping companies. The largest bulk exports are [[bauxite]] and sugar, and the largest volume imports are petroleum and wheat flour. Other important break-bulk exports include rice and timber.\n\nContainers are used but because they are not part of the internal transport system, they are loaded and unloaded at the ports.\n\nInternal barge transport is important for bauxite, sugar, rice and aggregates. In the case of sugar, for example, 98 percent of exports is delivered by barge to the port of Georgetown for export. Rivers are used for moving logs and account also for a significant share of those persons who travel to the interior.\n\nIt is estimated that about 1,000 kilometers of waterways in Guyana are utilized for commerce in Guyana. In addition, drainage canals are important transport channels for collecting sugar on the estates and for personal travel.\n\n==Ferries==\n[[Image:Pontoon Crossing at Mango Landing Essequibo River.jpg|thumb|Pontoon ferry crossing the Essequibo River]]\nFerry services link the primary roads in the coastal area, and Guyana with Suriname. The Government's Transport and Harbour Department provides scheduled ferry services in the Essequibo and Demerara rivers. Small privately owned river-craft supplement these services. Since the opening of the Berbice River Bridge in December 2008 the Transport and Harbour Department has reduced its service to only one round trip daily between Rosignol and New Amsterdam.\n\nCurrently the only ferry service consistently showing profit is The Parika-Adventure.  Service for the remainder, in particular The North West services, the Government provides a cross-subsidy funded out of the profits that are always realized by the Harbor Branch of the Transport and Harbors Department. Nevertheless, ferry operations have the potential to be profitable, provided that capital investments are made to improve their physical assets. With the establishment of a Maritime Administration and subsequently a National Sea Ports Authority the ferry operations may be privatized or operated as a commercially viable autonomous agency.\n\nThere is also a ferry linking Guyana and Suriname crossing the Corentyne River from Springlands (at Corriverton in Guyana) to Nieuw Nickerie, a town in Suriname. Leaving Rosignol at 8:00hrs and now at 14:30hrs respectively.  This service is primarily geared at offsetting the high cost for crossing the Berbice Bridge for school children, public servants and the elderly.\n\nUltimately, key ferry links were to be replaced with bridges, starting with one from Rosignol to New Amsterdam across the Berbice River.\n\nAt the end of 1999 the fleet of ferry vessels owned by the Transport and Harbors Department comprised nine motor vessels, six of which ranged in age from 15 to 55 years. Indeed, two of the vessels were over fifty years of age, and three over 30 years, with an average age of thirty-five. They are in almost continuous need of repair.\n\n==Air transportation==\n\nAir transportation for business and pleasure is readily available for traveling to many parts of the hinterland. Several local airlines depart from both [[Ogle Airport]] on the East Coast Demerara, {{convert|6|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|0}} south-east of Georgetown and from [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport]], at [[Timehri]], {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} south-west of Georgetown.\n\nAir transport plays a vital role in the development of Guyana. Within the country, it provides a link between the coastal areas and communities in the hinterland, many of which are inaccessible by any other means of transportation. Thus, the economic and social well being of these areas and their integration into the fabric of the nation are critically dependent on the availability of air transport. Externally, passengers are moved to and from the country almost entirely by air. In addition, the potential of this mode of transport for the carriage of cargo, especially exports, continues to increase.\n\nThe first airplane flight took place in Guyana in March 1913 when George Schmidt, a German, flew a machine over Georgetown, taking off from the [[Bel Air Park Race Course]].\n\nIn September 1929, the first airmail service to Guyana began.\n\nThe famous American flier, Colonel [[Charles Lindbergh]], arrived in the Demerara River with his flying boat (an amphibian craft) on September 22, 1929. The first regular flights to the interior started in 1939.\n\nAlthough air transport in Guyana had its beginnings in the 1920s when the first \"bush\" services were introduced, Government's earnest participation can be dated from 1947 when a Director of Civil Aviation was appointed to regulate the industry. Regular shipments of beef from the Rupununi to Georgetown by air began on 9 July 1948. Amphibian aircraft have been vital to the development of the country as they are able land both on airstrips and on water.\n\nThe development of air transport in Guyana owes much to [[Arthur James Williams|Arthur \"Art\" James Williams]], a pilot and mechanic from the United States. He arrived in British Guiana in August 1934, and returned to the United States in October 1955. Over this period, except for the [[World War II|war years]], during which he served with the United States Air Force, he developed [[British Guiana Airways]] Ltd. (registered 27 May 1938) and operating regular internal services since 1939.\n\nOn 15 July 1955, the Government purchased British Guiana Airways. However, external services continued to be supplied almost exclusively by foreign airlines until [[Guyana Airways Corporation]] commenced regional air services in 1979. Subsequently, restrictions on the repatriation of profits in foreign exchange and other circumstances contributed to the withdrawal of services to Guyana by foreign airlines, with the exception of [[BWIA]]. Guyana Airways Corporation was therefore obliged to fill the breach by commencing jet operations to [[Miami]] and [[New York City|New York]] in the US and [[Toronto, Ontario]] in Canada.\n\nIn the 1980s Guyana Airways Corporation's domestic operations started to deteriorate for a number of reasons, not least among them the unrealistically low fares it was required to charge and the lack of access to foreign exchange for imported aircraft parts and other requirements. The private sector therefore began to fill the gap and by 1991 three major domestic charter operators had emerged. In the meantime, Guyana Airways Corporation's domestic service continued to deteriorate and, by 1993, possessed only one [[Twin Otter]] DHC-6 to service the entire country. Under new management it was revitalized and saw a partial return to its original domestic role with the reintroduction of several domestic scheduled routes, because of the addition of two [[Shorts Skyvan]] SC7 aircraft, and a second Twin Otter DHC-6 aircraft.\n\nIn 2010, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) conferred \"international\" status to the air terminal at Ogle (IATA: OGL, ICAO: SYGO), a former sugarcane airstrip just a few kilometres south of Georgetown's center. In anticipation of increased regional air traffic to the facility, an EU-subsidized construction project began in January of that year, intended to upgrade the terminal building and extend the primary paved runway to a usable length of 4000 feet. Ogle is the hub for domestic flights to Guyana's interior and offers once-daily service to the in-town airstrip in Paramaribo, capital of neighboring Suriname.\n\n==Challenges and future development==\n\nThe gross inadequacy of Guyana's transportation system militates against its social and economic development in several ways. First, it increases production costs and, therefore, reduces competitiveness, particularly in the mining and forestry sectors. Second, it inhibits the capacity to fully utilise those natural resources (gold, timber, diamonds, soils suitable for agriculture) that are not located on the coastland. Third, by severely limiting communication between those who live on the coast and those who inhabit the hinterland, it effectively divides the country into two almost unbridgeable cultures. Fourth, it acts as a barrier to the unity of the country in both a physical and spiritual sense: because they are not unified physically, Guyanese seem to find it difficult to think as Guyanese, to act as if they are one nation. Fifth, it restricts the coastal population's penetration of the interior, and forces coastlanders to live in a cramped and crowded manner on the coast, struggling and competing for land-space and other amenities, while more suitable areas are available farther south. And sixth, failure to occupy the greater part of the country, might tend to bolster some of the claims of Guyana's neighbours to its territory.\n\nThe government of Guyana and Brazil signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2012 to explore the development of Hydro Power, Linden-Lethem Road and Deep Water Harbour to boost bilateral trade and cooperation. This network would have enabled easy access by road to the neighbouring countries of Brazil, Venezuela and Surinam; reduced the costs of utilising the country's timber and natural resources, thus making them more competitive in international markets; diversified agricultural development by making more easily available suitable areas in the hinterland, particularly in the Intermediate and Rupununi savannahs; relieved the over-crowded coastland of a significant proportion of its population, thus improving the quality of life of the inhabitants of both the coastal and interior areas; and made more feasible the equitable distribution of economic activity, not only in the agricultural but also in the manufacturing and small- industries sector.\n\nA high-span fixed bridge is currently being studied to replace the existing DHB; a series of bridges and causeways linking the islands in the mouth of the Essequibo River to Morasi on the East Bank and Supenaam on the West Bank; and another high-span bridge across the Essequibo River at Monkey Jump.\n\nConstruction of a bridge across the Berbice River at Crab Island and D'Edwards on the East and West banks of Berbice River was completed in 2008.\n\nIn 2012, The Government of Guyana signed a contract with CHEC of China for the expansion of the runway at the CJIA and the construction of a modern terminal building at an estimated cost of 131Million US Dollars. Moreover, the airstrip at Timehri Airport would have been extended, and the entire Airport refurbished to accommodate an increasing number of passengers. The airport at Ogle would have been privatised, and much improved and extended.\n\n==Statistics==\n\n===[[Rail transport|Railways]]===\n''Total:''\n187&nbsp;km (all dedicated to ore transport)\n<br>''[[Standard gauge]]:''\n139&nbsp;km; {{RailGauge|ussg}}\n<br>''[[Narrow gauge railway|Narrow gauge]]:''\n48&nbsp;km; {{RailGauge|3ft|lk=on}} gauge\n\n{{See also|Railways in Guyana}}\n\n===[[Highway]]s===\n''Total:''\n7,970&nbsp;km\n<br>''Paved:''\n590&nbsp;km\n<br>''Unpaved:''\n7,380&nbsp;km (1996 est.)\n* [[Right- and left-hand traffic|Driving is on the left]], a practice inherited from [[United Kingdom]] colonial authorities.

It served twice on the UN Security Council (1975\u201376 and 1982\u201383). Former Vice President, Deputy Prime Minister, and Attorney General [[Mohamed Shahabuddeen]] served a 9-year term on the [[International Court of Justice]] (1987\u201396).\n\nGuyana has diplomatic relations with a wide range of nations, and these managed primarily through its [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Guyana)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. The [[European Union]] (EU), the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), and the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) have offices in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]].\n\nGuyana strongly supports the concept of regional integration. It played an important role in the founding of the [[Caribbean Community and Common Market]] (CARICOM), but its status as the organization's poorest member limits its ability to exert leadership in regional activities. Guyana has sought to keep foreign policy in close alignment with the consensus of CARICOM members, especially in voting in the UN, OAS, and other international organizations. In 1993, Guyana ratified the 1988 Vienna Convention on illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and cooperates with US law enforcement agencies on counter-narcotics efforts.\n\nTwo neighbours have longstanding territorial disputes with Guyana. Since the 19th century, [[Venezuela]] has claimed all of Guyana west of the [[Essequibo River]] \u2013 62% of Guyana's territory. At a meeting in Geneva in 1966, the two countries agreed to receive recommendations from a representative of the UN Secretary General on ways to settle the dispute peacefully. Diplomatic contacts between the two countries and the Secretary General's representative continue. Neighbouring [[Suriname]] also claims the territory east of Guyana's New River, a largely uninhabited area of some {{convert|15000|km2|sqmi}} in southeast Guyana. Guyana and Suriname also disputed their offshore [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]]. This dispute flared up in June 2000 in response to an effort by a Canadian company to drill for oil under a Guyanese concession. Guyana regards its legal title to all of its territory as sound.

Geology can also refer to the study of the solid features  of any [[terrestrial planet]] or [[natural satellite]] such as [[Geology of Mars|Mars]] or [[geology of the Moon|the Moon]]. Modern geology significantly overlaps all other [[earth sciences]], including [[hydrology]] and the [[atmospheric sciences]], and so is treated as one major aspect of integrated [[earth system science]] and [[planetary science]].\n\n[[File:1875_Dumont%27s_geological_map_of_Europe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|1875 [[geological map]] of Europe, compiled by the Belgian geologist [[Andr\u00e9 Dumont]]. Colors indicate the distribution of different [[Lithology|rock types]] across the continent, as they were known then.]]\n\nGeology describes the [[structure of the Earth]] beneath its surface, and the processes that have shaped that structure. It also provides tools to determine the [[Relative dating|relative]] and [[Geochronology|absolute ages]] of rocks found in a given location, and also to describe the histories of those rocks.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} By combining these tools, [[geologist]]s are able to chronicle the geological [[history of the Earth]] as a whole, and also to demonstrate the [[age of the Earth]]. Geology provides the primary evidence for [[plate tectonics]], the [[evolutionary history of life]], and the Earth's [[paleoclimatology|past climates]].\n\nGeologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the Earth's structure and evolution, including [[field work]], [[Petrology|rock description]], [[Geophysical survey|geophysical techniques]], [[Geochemistry|chemical analysis]], [[physical experiment]]s, and [[Computer simulation|numerical modelling]]. In practical terms, geology is important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] exploration and exploitation, evaluating [[water resources]], understanding of [[natural hazard]]s, the remediation of [[Environmental Geology|environmental]] problems, and providing insights into past [[climate change]]. Geology, a major [[academic discipline]], also plays a role in [[geotechnical engineering]].\n\n==Geologic materials==\nThe majority of geological data comes from research on solid Earth materials. These typically fall into one of two categories: rock and unconsolidated material.\n\n===Rock===\n[[File:rock cycle.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|This schematic diagram of the rock cycle shows the relationship between magma and sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rock]]\n\n{{Main|Rock (geology)|Rock cycle}}\n\nThe majority of research in geology is associated with the study of rock, as rock provides the primary record of the majority of the geologic history of the Earth. There are three major types of rock: [[igneous]], [[sedimentary]], and [[metamorphic]]. The [[rock cycle]]  \nillustrates the relationships among them (see diagram).\n\nWhen a rock [[crystallization|crystallizes]] from melt ([[magma]] or [[lava]]), it is an igneous rock. This rock can be [[weathering|weathered]] and [[eroded]], then [[deposition (geology)|redeposited]] and [[lithification|lithified]] into a sedimentary rock. It can then be turned into a [[metamorphic rock]] by heat and pressure that change its [[mineral]] content, resulting in a [[fabric (geology)|characteristic fabric]]. All three types may melt again, and when this happens, new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once more crystallize.\n\n[[File:Mineralsbox.jpg|thumb|Minerals]]\n\n====Tests====\nTo study all three types of rock, geologists evaluate the minerals of which they are composed. Each mineral has distinct physical properties, and there are many tests to determine each of them. The specimens can be tested for:\n\n*Luster: Measurement of the amount of light reflected from the surface. Luster is broken into metallic and nonmetallic. \n*Color: Minerals are grouped by their color. Mostly diagnostic but impurities can change a mineral\u2019s color.\n*Streak: Performed by scratching the sample on a porcelain plate. The color of the streak can help name the mineral. \n*Hardness: The resistance of a mineral to scratch. \n*Breakage pattern: A mineral can either show fracture or cleavage, the former being breakage of uneven surfaces and the latter a breakage along closely spaced parallel planes.\n*Specific gravity: the weight of a specific volume of a mineral.\n*Effervescence: Involves dripping [[hydrochloric acid]] on the mineral to test for fizzing. \n*Magnetism: Involves using a magnet to test for magnetism.\n*Taste: Minerals can have a distinctive taste, like [[halite]] (which tastes like [[table salt]]).\n*Smell: Minerals can have a distinctive odor. For example, [[sulfur]] smells like rotten eggs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mineral Identification Tests|url=http://jersey.uoregon.edu/~mstrick/MinRockID/MinTests.html|website=Geoman's Mineral ID Tests|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Unconsolidated material===\nGeologists also study unlithified materials (referred to as ''[[Drift (geology)|drift]]''), which typically come from more recent deposits. These materials are [[superficial deposits]] which lie above the [[bedrock]].<ref>[http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/gsu/gmp/categories/overview.htm \"Surficial Geologic Maps\"] in New Hampshire Geological Survey, Geologic maps. des.nh.gov</ref> This study is often known as [[Quaternary geology]], after the [[Quaternary period]] of geologic history.\n\n==Whole-Earth structure==\n\n===Plate tectonics===\n{{Main|Plate tectonics}}\n[[File:Active Margin.svg|thumb|left|Oceanic-continental convergence resulting in [[subduction]] and [[volcanic arc]]s illustrates one effect of [[plate tectonics]].]]\n\nIn the 1960s, it was discovered that the Earth's [[lithosphere]], which includes the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and rigid uppermost portion of the [[upper mantle]], is separated into [[tectonic plate]]s that move across the [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically]] deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the [[asthenosphere]]. This theory is supported by several types of observations, including seafloor spreading<ref>Hess, H. H. (November 1, 1962) \"[http://repositories.cdlib.org/sio/lib/23 History Of Ocean Basins]\", pp. 599\u2013620 in ''Petrologic studies: a volume in honor of A. F. Buddington''. A. E. J. Engel, Harold L.

Thus, oceanic plates and the adjoining mantle [[Convection|convection currents]] always move in the same direction \u2014 because the oceanic lithosphere is actually the rigid upper thermal [[boundary layer]] of the convecting mantle. This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is called plate tectonics.\n\n[[File:Farallon Plate.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In this diagram, subducting [[Slab (geology)|slabs]] are in blue and continental margins and a few plate boundaries are in red. The blue blob in the cutaway section is the seismically imaged [[Farallon Plate]], which is subducting beneath North America. The remnants of this plate on the surface of the Earth are the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] and [[Explorer Plate]], both in the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada, and the [[Cocos Plate]] on the west coast of Mexico.]]\n\nThe development of plate tectonics has provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth. Long linear regions of geologic features are explained as plate boundaries.<ref name=\"TDE plates\">{{Cite book |last=Kious |first=Jacquelyne |author2=Tilling, Robert I. |others=Kiger, Martha, Russel, Jane |title=This Dynamic Earth: The Story of Plate Tectonics |publisher=United States Geological Survey |location=Reston, Virginia, USA |date=February 1996 |edition=Online |chapter=Understanding Plate Motions |isbn=0-16-048220-8 |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html |accessdate=13 March 2009}}</ref> For example:\n\n*[[Mid-ocean ridge]]s, high regions on the seafloor where [[hydrothermal vent]]s and volcanoes exist, are seen as [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], where two plates move apart.\n\n* Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes are theorized as [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], where one plate [[subduction|subducts]], or moves, under another.\n\n[[Transform boundary|Transform boundaries]], such as the [[San Andreas Fault]] system, resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes. Plate tectonics also has provided a mechanism for [[Alfred Wegener]]'s theory of [[continental drift]],<ref>{{Cite book |isbn=0-486-61708-4|year=1999 |publisher=Courier Corporation|author=Wegener, A. |title=Origin of continents and oceans}}</ref> in which the [[continents]] move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time. They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology. The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.\n\n===Earth structure===\n{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}\n[[File:Jordens inre-numbers.svg|thumb|left|The [[Earth]]'s layered structure.

Typical wave paths from earthquakes like these gave early seismologists insights into the layered structure of the Earth]]\nAdvances in [[seismology]], [[computer modeling]], and [[mineralogy]] and [[crystallography]] at high temperatures and pressures give insights into the internal composition and structure of the Earth.\n\nSeismologists can use the arrival times of [[seismic wave]]s in reverse to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid [[outer core]] (where [[S-wave|shear waves]] were not able to propagate) and a dense solid [[inner core]]. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and [[lithosphere]] on top, the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] below (separated within itself by [[Seismic tomography|seismic discontinuities]] at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.\n\nMineralogists have been able to use the pressure and temperature data from the seismic and modelling studies alongside knowledge of the elemental composition of the Earth to reproduce these conditions in experimental settings and measure changes in crystal structure. These studies explain the chemical changes associated with the major seismic discontinuities in the mantle and show the crystallographic structures expected in the inner core of the Earth.\n\n==Geologic time==\n{{Main|History of Earth|Geologic time scale}}\n\nThe geologic time scale encompasses the history of the Earth.<ref>[http://www.stratigraphy.org/ International Commission on Stratigraphy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050920105136/http://www.stratigraphy.org/ |date=September 20, 2005 }}. stratigraphy.org</ref> It is bracketed at the earliest by the dates of the first [[Solar System]] material at 4.567 [[Gigaannum|Ga]]<ref name=\"4.567\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1073950| title = Lead Isotopic Ages of Chondrules and Calcium-Aluminum-Rich Inclusions| journal = Science| volume = 297| issue = 5587| pages = 1678\u20131683| year = 2002| last1 = Amelin | first1 = Y.|bibcode = 2002Sci...297.1678A| pmid=12215641}}</ref> (or 4.567 billion years ago) and the formation of the Earth at \n4.54 Ga<ref name=\"4.54\">{{cite journal|author=Patterson, C.|year= 1956|title=Age of Meteorites and the Earth|journal= Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |volume=10|issue= 4|pages= 230\u2013237|bibcode = 1956GeCoA..10..230P |doi = 10.1016/0016-7037(56)90036-9 }}</ref><ref name=\"4.54 book\">{{Cite book |isbn=0-8047-2331-1 |author=Dalrymple, G.

In geology, when an [[igneous rocks|igneous]] intrusion cuts across a formation of [[sedimentary rock]], it can be determined that the igneous intrusion is younger than the sedimentary rock. Different types of intrusions include stocks, [[laccolith]]s, [[batholith]]s, [[Sill (geology)|sills]] and [[Dike (geology)|dikes]].\n\n'''The [[principle of cross-cutting relationships]]''' pertains to the formation of [[Fault (geology)|faults]] and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a [[normal fault]] or a [[thrust fault]].<ref name=\"steno strat\">{{cite web |url=http://rainbow.ldeo.columbia.edu/courses/v1001/steno.html |title=Steno's Principles of Stratigraphy |last=Olsen |first=Paul E. |year=2001 |work=Dinosaurs and the History of Life |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref>\n\n'''The [[principle of inclusions and components]]''' states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or ''[[Clastic rocks|clasts]]'') are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when [[xenolith]]s are found. These foreign bodies are picked up as [[magma]] or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them.\n\n[[File:SEUtahStrat.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Permian]] through [[Jurassic]] stratigraphy of the [[Colorado Plateau]] area of southeastern [[Utah]] is an example of both original horizontality and the law of superposition.

Picture from [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]], Utah.]]\n'''The [[principle of original horizontality]]''' states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds. Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments in a wide variety of environments supports this generalization (although [[cross-bedding]] is inclined, the overall orientation of cross-bedded units is horizontal).<ref name=\"steno strat\" />\n\n'''The [[Law of superposition|principle of superposition]]''' states that a sedimentary rock layer in a [[tectonics|tectonically]] undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger layer cannot slip beneath a layer previously deposited. This principle allows sedimentary layers to be viewed as a form of vertical time line, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to deposition of the highest bed.<ref name=\"steno strat\" />\n\n'''The [[principle of faunal succession]]''' is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found. Based on principles laid out by William Smith almost a hundred years before the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat ([[facies]] change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time.<ref>As recounted in [[Simon Winchester]], ''[[The Map that Changed the World]]'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2001) pp. 59\u201391.</ref>\n\n===Absolute dating===\n{{Main|Absolute dating|radiometric dating|geochronology}}\nGeologists also use methods to determine the absolute age of rock samples and geological events.

This changed the understanding of geologic time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates, it became possible to assign [[Absolute dating|absolute ages]] to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.\n\nFor many geologic applications, [[isotope ratio]]s of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular [[closure temperature]], the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]].<ref>{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-582-06701-1 |author=Rollinson, Hugh R.  |year=1996 |publisher=Longman |location=Harlow |title=Using geochemical data evaluation, presentation, interpretation}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-02-336450-1 |author=Faure, Gunter |year=1998 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |title=Principles and applications of geochemistry: a comprehensive textbook for geology students}}</ref> These are used in [[geochronology|geochronologic]] and [[thermochronology|thermochronologic]] studies. Common methods include [[uranium-lead dating]], [[potassium-argon dating]], [[argon-argon dating]] and [[uranium-thorium dating]]. These methods are used for a variety of applications. Dating of [[lava]] and [[volcanic ash]] layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques. These methods can also be used to determine ages of [[pluton]] emplacement. \nThermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain ranges, and paleotopography.\n\nFractionation of the [[lanthanide series]] elements is used to compute ages since rocks were removed from the mantle.\n\nOther methods are used for more recent events. [[Optically stimulated luminescence]] and [[Cosmogenic isotope#Natural|cosmogenic radionuclide]] dating are used to date surfaces and/or erosion rates. [[Dendrochronology]] can also be used for the dating of landscapes. [[Radiocarbon dating]] is used for geologically young materials containing [[Organic matter|organic carbon]].\n\n==Geological development of an area==\n[[File:Volcanosed.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|An originally horizontal sequence of sedimentary rocks (in shades of tan) are affected by [[igneous]] activity. Deep below the surface are a [[magma chamber]] and large associated igneous bodies. The magma chamber feeds the [[volcano]], and sends offshoots of [[magma]] that will later crystallize into dikes and sills. Magma also advances upwards to form [[intrusive rock|intrusive igneous bodies]]. The diagram illustrates both a [[cinder cone]] volcano, which releases ash, and a [[composite volcano]], which releases both lava and ash.]]\n[[File:Fault types.png|thumb|left|upright=0.9| An illustration of the three types of faults. Strike-slip faults occur when rock units slide past one another, normal faults occur when rocks are undergoing horizontal extension, and reverse (or thrust) faults occur when rocks are undergoing horizontal shortening.]]\nThe geology of an area changes through time as rock units are deposited and inserted, and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.\n\nRock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrusion into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into sedimentary rock, or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava flow]]s blanket the surface. [[Igneous intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.\n\nAfter the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.\n\nWhen rock units are placed under horizontal [[compression (geology)|compression]], they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units, other than muds, [[Incompressible surface|do not significantly change in volume]], this is accomplished in two primary ways: through [[fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[fold (geology)|folding]]. In the shallow crust, where [[brittle deformation]] can occur, thrust faults form, which causes deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the [[law of superposition|principle of superposition]], this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"[[antiform]]s\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"[[synform]]s\". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called [[anticline]]s and [[syncline]]s, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms.\n[[File:Antecline (PSF).png|thumb|right|A diagram of folds, indicating an [[anticline]] and a [[syncline]].]]\nEven higher pressures and temperatures during horizontal shortening can cause both folding and [[metamorphism]] of the rocks. This metamorphism causes changes in the [[mineral|mineral composition]] of the rocks; creates a [[foliation (geology)|foliation]], or planar surface, that is related to mineral growth under stress.  This can remove signs of the original textures of the rocks, such as [[bed (geology)|bedding]] in sedimentary rocks, flow features of [[lava]]s, and crystal patterns in [[crystalline rock]]s.\n\nExtension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished through [[normal fault]]ing and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger units being placed below older units. Stretching of units can result in their thinning; in fact, there is a location within the [[Maria Fold and Thrust Belt]] in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the [[Grand Canyon]] can be seen over a length of less than a meter. Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses, known as [[boudinage|boudins]], after the French word for \"sausage\", because of their visual similarity.\n\nWhere rock units slide past one another, [[strike-slip fault]]s develop in shallow regions, and become [[shear zone]]s at deeper depths where the rocks deform ductilely.\n\n[[File:Kittatinny Mountain Cross Section.jpg|thumb|right|Geologic [[cross section (geology)|cross section]] of [[Kittatinny Mountain]]. This cross section shows metamorphic rocks, overlain by younger sediments deposited after the metamorphic event. These rock units were later folded and faulted during the uplift of the mountain.]]\n\nThe addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create [[accommodation space]] for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. [[Dike (geology)|Dikes]], long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of [[dike swarm]]s, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the [[lava tube]] of a volcano.\n\nAll of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment, and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The [[Hawaiian Islands]], for example, consist almost entirely of layered [[basalt]]ic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the [[Geology of the Grand Canyon area|Grand Canyon]] in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since [[Cambrian]] time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the [[Acasta gneiss]] of the [[Slave craton]] in northwestern [[Canada]], the [[Oldest rock|oldest known rock in the world]] have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the [[Historical geology|geological history]] of an area.\n\n==Methods of geology==\nGeologists use a number of field, laboratory, and numerical modeling methods to decipher Earth history and to understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth. In typical geological investigations, geologists use primary information related to [[petrology]] (the study of rocks), stratigraphy (the study of sedimentary layers), and structural geology (the study of positions of rock units and their deformation). In many cases, geologists also study modern soils, [[river]]s, [[landscape]]s, and [[glacier]]s; investigate past and current life and [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] pathways, and use [[geophysics|geophysical methods]] to investigate the subsurface.

In addition, they perform [[analogue modelling (geology)|analog]] and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings.\n\nThe analysis of structures is often accomplished by plotting the orientations of various features onto [[stereographic projection|stereonets]]. A stereonet is a stereographic projection of a sphere onto a plane, in which planes are projected as lines and lines are projected as points. These can be used to find the locations of fold axes, relationships between faults, and relationships between other geologic structures.\n\nAmong the most well-known experiments in structural geology are those involving [[Accretionary wedge|orogenic wedges]], which are zones in which [[mountain]]s are built along [[convergent boundary|convergent]] tectonic plate boundaries.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1146/annurev.ea.18.050190.000415 |title= Critical Taper Model of Fold-And-Thrust Belts and Accretionary Wedges |year= 1990 |author= Dahlen, F A |journal= Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume= 18 |pages= 55\u201399|bibcode = 1990AREPS..18...55D }}</ref> In the analog versions of these experiments, horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop, which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a [[critical taper|critically tapered]] (all angles remain the same) orogenic wedge.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1016/S0191-8141(97)00096-5 |title= Material transfer in accretionary wedges from analysis of a systematic series of analog experiments |year= 1998 |author= Gutscher, M |journal= Journal of Structural Geology |volume= 20 |pages= 407\u2013416 |issue= 4|bibcode = 1998JSG....20..407G |last2= Kukowski |first2= Nina |last3= Malavieille |first3= Jacques |last4= Lallemand |first4= Serge }}</ref> Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models, though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1146/annurev.ea.23.050195.002111 |title= Modeling the Topographic Evolution of Collisional Belts |year= 1995 |author= Koons, P O |journal= Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume= 23 |pages= 375\u2013408|bibcode = 1995AREPS..23..375K }}</ref> This helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of a mountain range.

This new field of study is called [[planetary geology]] (sometimes known as astrogeology) and relies on known geologic principles to study other bodies of the solar system.\n\nAlthough the Greek-language-origin prefix ''[[wikt:geo-|geo]]'' refers to Earth, \"geology\" is often used in conjunction with the names of other planetary bodies when describing their composition and internal processes: examples are \"the [[geology of Mars]]\" and \"[[Lunar geology]]\". Specialised terms such as ''selenology'' (studies of the Moon), ''areology'' (of Mars), etc., are also in use.\n\nAlthough planetary geologists are interested in studying all aspects of other planets, a significant focus is to search for evidence of past or present life on other worlds. This has led to many missions whose primary or ancillary purpose is to examine planetary bodies for evidence of life. One of these is the [[Phoenix lander]], which analyzed [[Mars|Martian]] polar soil for water, chemical, and mineralogical constituents related to biological processes.\n\n==Applied geology==\n\n===Economic geology===\n{{Main|Economic geology}}\nEconomic geology is an important branch of geology which deals with different aspects of economic minerals being used by humankind to fulfill its various needs.

Economic geologists help locate and manage the Earth's [[natural resource]]s, such as petroleum and coal, as well as mineral resources, which include metals such as iron, copper, and uranium.\n\n====Mining geology====\n{{Main|Mining}}\n[[Mining geology]] consists of the extractions of mineral resources from the Earth. Some resources of economic interests include [[gemstone]]s, [[metal]]s such as [[gold]] and [[copper]], and many minerals such as [[asbestos]], [[perlite]], [[mica]], [[phosphate]]s, [[zeolites]], [[clay]], [[pumice]], [[quartz]], and [[silica]], as well as elements such as [[sulfur]], [[chlorine]], and [[helium]].\n\n====Petroleum geology====\n[[File:Mudlogging.JPG|thumb|Mud log in process, a common way to study the [[lithology]] when drilling oil wells.]]\n{{Main|Petroleum geology}}\n[[Petroleum geologist]]s study the locations of the subsurface of the Earth which can contain extractable hydrocarbons, especially [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]].

In his paper, he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for [[sediment]]s to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land. Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795 ([http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12861 Vol. 1], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14179 Vol. 2]).\n[[File:Hutton James portrait Raeburn.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Scottish people|Scotsman]] James Hutton, father of modern geology]]\nFollowers of Hutton were known as ''[[Plutonism|Plutonists]]'' because they believed that some rocks were formed by ''vulcanism'', which is the deposition of lava from volcanoes, as opposed to the ''[[Neptunism|Neptunists]]'', led by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Abraham Werner]], who believed that all rocks had settled out of a large ocean whose level gradually dropped over time.\n\nThe first [[Geologic map of Georgia|geological map of the U.S.]] was produced in 1809 by [[William Maclure]].<ref name=\"Maclure1817\">{{cite book|author=Maclure, William |title=Observations on the Geology of the United States of America: With Some Remarks on the Effect Produced on the Nature and Fertility of Soils, by the Decomposition of the Different Classes of Rocks; and an Application to the Fertility of Every State in the Union, in Reference to the Accompanying Geological Map.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_bgQAAAAIAAJ|year=1817|publisher=Abraham Small|location= Philadelphia}}</ref> In 1807, Maclure commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States.

This book, which influenced the thought of [[Charles Darwin]], successfully promoted the doctrine of [[uniformitarianism]]. This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] and are still occurring today. In contrast, [[catastrophism]] is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter. Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism, the idea was not widely accepted at the time.\n\nMuch of 19th-century geology revolved around the question of the [[Age of the Earth|Earth's exact age]]. Estimates varied from a few hundred thousand to billions of years.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1130/GSAT01701A.1 |title=John Perry's neglected critique of Kelvin's age for the Earth: A missed opportunity in geodynamics |year=2007 |author=England, Philip |journal=GSA Today |volume=17 |page=4 |last2=Molnar |first2=Peter |last3=Richter |first3=Frank}}</ref> By the early 20th century, [[radiometric dating]] allowed the Earth's age to be estimated at two billion years. The awareness of this vast amount of time opened the door to new theories about the processes that shaped the planet.\n\nSome of the most significant advances in 20th-century geology have been the development of the theory of [[plate tectonics]] in the 1960s and the refinement of estimates of the planet's age. Plate tectonics theory arose from two separate geological observations: [[seafloor spreading]] and [[continental drift]]. The theory revolutionized the [[Earth sciences]].

In 1939 he was selected for a musical revue, ''One for the Money'', produced by the actress [[Katharine Cornell]], who was known for finding and hiring talented young actors.\n\nKelly's first big breakthrough was in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning ''[[The Time of Your Life]]'', which opened on October 25, 1939\u2014in which, for the first time on Broadway, he danced to his own choreography. In the same year, he received his first assignment as a Broadway choreographer, for ''[[Billy Rose]]'s Diamond Horseshoe''. He began dating a cast member, [[Betsy Blair]], and they got married on October 16, 1941.\n\nIn 1940, he got the lead role in [[Rodgers and Hart]]'s ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'', again choreographed by Robert Alton. This role propelled him to stardom. During its run he told reporters: \"I don't believe in conformity to any school of dancing. I create what the drama and the music demand. While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use. I never let technique get in the way of mood or continuity.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> His colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work. [[Van Johnson]]\u2014who also appeared in ''Pal Joey''\u2014recalled: \"I watched him rehearsing, and it seemed to me that there was no possible room for improvement. Yet he wasn't satisfied. It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since 8 in the morning. I was making my way sleepily down the long flight of stairs when I heard staccato steps coming from the stage ... I could see just a single lamp burning. Under it, a figure was dancing ... Gene.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\nOffers from Hollywood began to arrive, but Kelly was in no hurry to leave New York. Eventually, he signed with [[David O. Selznick]], agreeing to go to Hollywood at the end of his commitment to ''Pal Joey'', in October 1941. Prior to his contract, he also managed to fit in choreographing the stage production of ''[[Best Foot Forward (musical)|Best Foot Forward]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Film career==\n\n===1941\u201345: Becoming established in Hollywood===\n[[File:Gene Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse (\"Anchors Aweigh\", 1945).gif|right|thumb|Gene Kelly dances with [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]] of [[Tom and Jerry]] in ''Anchors Aweigh'' (1945), an iconic performance which changed at least one critic's opinion of Kelly's skills.]]\n\nSelznick sold half of Kelly's contract to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] for his first motion picture: ''[[For Me and My Gal (film)|For Me and My Gal]]'' (1942) starring box-office champion [[Judy Garland]]. Kelly claimed to be \"appalled at the sight of myself blown up twenty times. I had an awful feeling that I was a tremendous flop.\" ''For Me and My Gal'' performed very well and, in the face of much internal resistance, [[Arthur Freed]] of MGM picked up the other half of Kelly's contract.<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> After appearing in a cheap B-movie drama, ''[[Pilot No. 5]]'' (1943) and in ''[[Christmas Holiday]]'' (1944), he took the male lead in Cole Porter's ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady (film)|Du Barry Was a Lady]]'' (1943) with [[Lucille Ball]] (in a part originally intended for [[Ann Sothern]]). His first opportunity to dance to his own choreography came in his next picture, ''[[Thousands Cheer]]'' (1943), where he performed a mock-love dance with a mop.\n\nHe achieved a significant breakthrough as a dancer on film when MGM loaned him to [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] to work with [[Rita Hayworth]] in ''[[Cover Girl (film)|Cover Girl]]'' (1944), a film that foreshadowed the best of his future work.<ref name=\"Hess\">{{cite book  |last1= Hess  |first1= Earl J.  |last2= Dabholkar  |first2= Pratibha A.  |title= Singin' in the Rain: The Making of an American Masterpiece  |year=2009  |publisher= University Press of Kansas  |location= Lawrence, Kansas  |isbn= 978-0-7006-1656-5  |page= 33 }}</ref> He created a memorable routine dancing to his own reflection. Despite this, noted critic [[Manny Farber]] was moved to praise Kelly's \"attitude,\" \"clarity,\" and \"feeling\" as an actor while inauspiciously concluding, \"The two things he does least well\u2014singing and dancing\u2014are what he is given most consistently to do.\"<ref>Farber, Manny, The New Republic, May 15, 1944, as reprinted in 'Farber on Film,' Library of America, 2009, pg. 163</ref> At the end of 1944, Kelly enlisted in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Naval Air Service]] and was commissioned as [[lieutenant, junior grade]].

In ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]'' (1946)\u2014which was produced in 1944 but not released until 1946\u2014Kelly collaborated with [[Fred Astaire]], for whom he had the greatest admiration, in the famous \"The Babbitt and the Bromide\" challenge dance routine.\n\n===1946\u201352: MGM===\nAfter Kelly returned to Hollywood in 1946, MGM had nothing planned and used him in a routine, black-and-white movie: ''[[Living in a Big Way]]''. The film was considered so weak that the studio asked Kelly to design and insert a series of dance routines; they noticed his ability to carry out such assignments. This led to a lead part in his next picture, with [[Judy Garland]] and director [[Vincente Minnelli]]\u2014 a musical film version of [[S.N. Behrman]]'s play, ''[[The Pirate (1948 film)|The Pirate]]'', with songs by [[Cole Porter]], in which Kelly plays the lead opposite [[Judy Garland]]. ''The Pirate'' gave full rein to Kelly's athleticism. It is also notable for Kelly's work with [[The Nicholas Brothers]] \u2013 the leading black dancers of their day \u2013 in a virtuoso dance routine. Now regarded as a classic, the film was ahead of its time but flopped at the box-office.\n\n[[File:An American in Paris (1951) trailer 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leslie Caron]] and Kelly in the trailer for ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'' (1951)]]\nMGM wanted Kelly to return to safer and more commercial vehicles, but he ceaselessly fought for an opportunity to direct his own musical film. In the interim, he capitalized on his swashbuckling image as [[d'Artagnan]] in ''[[The Three Musketeers (1948 film)|The Three Musketeers]]''\u2014and also appeared with [[Vera-Ellen]] in the ''[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]'' ballet in ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'' (1948). He was due to play the male lead opposite Garland in ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' (1948), but broke his ankle playing volleyball. He withdrew from the film and convinced [[Fred Astaire]] to come out of retirement to replace him.<ref name=\"Astaire\">{{cite book | last = Astaire|first = Fred|title = Steps in Time|publisher = Heinemann|year = 1959|location = London|page = 291 | isbn = 0-241-11749-6 }}</ref> There followed ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game (film)|Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]'' (1949), his second film with Sinatra, where Kelly paid tribute to his Irish heritage in ''The Hat My Father Wore on St. Patrick's Day'' routine. This musical film persuaded Arthur Freed to have Kelly make ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'', in which he partnered with Frank Sinatra for the third and final time. A breakthrough in the musical film genre, it has been described as \"the most inventive and effervescent musical thus far produced in Hollywood.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\n[[Stanley Donen]], brought to Hollywood by Kelly to be his assistant choreographer, received co-director credit for ''On the Town''. According to Kelly: \"... when you are involved in doing choreography for film you must have expert assistants. I needed one to watch my performance, and one to work with the cameraman on the timing ... without such people as Stanley, [[Carol Haney]] and [[Jeanne Coyne]] I could never have done these things. When we came to do ''On the Town'', I knew it was time for Stanley to get screen credit because we weren't boss\u2013assistant anymore but co-creators.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\" /><ref>Blair, p.104: \"Gene was the central creative force in this initial collaboration, but he was always generous about Stanley's contribution ... Unfortunately, and mysteriously for me, Stanley, over the years, had been less than gracious about Gene\"</ref> Together, they opened up the musical form, taking the film musical out of the studio and into real locations, with Donen taking responsibility for the staging and Kelly handling the choreography. Kelly went much further than before in introducing modern ballet into his dance sequences, going so far in the \"Day in New York\" routine as to substitute four leading ballet specialists for Sinatra, Munshin, Garrett and Miller.<ref name=\"Hirschhorn\" />\n\nKelly asked the studio for a straight acting role and he took the lead role in the early [[mafia]] melodrama ''[[Black Hand (1950 film)|Black Hand]]'' (1950). This expos\u00e9 of organized crime is set in New York's \"Little Italy\" during late 19th century and focuses on the [[Black Hand (extortion)|Black Hand]], a group that extorts money upon threat of death. In real-life incidents upon which this film is based, it was [[Italian-American Mafia|the Mafia]], not the Black Hand, who functioned as the villain. Even in 1950, however, Hollywood had to tread gingerly whenever dealing with big-time crime, it being safer to go after a \"dead\" criminal organization than a \"live\" one. There followed ''[[Summer Stock]]'' (1950)\u2014Garland's last musical film for MGM\u2014in which Kelly performed the celebrated \"You, You Wonderful You\" solo routine with a newspaper and a squeaky floorboard. In his book \"Easy the Hard Way,\" [[Joe Pasternak]], head of one of the other musical units within MGM, singled out Kelly for his patience and willingness to spend as much time as necessary to enable the ailing Garland to complete her part.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\n[[File:Singin' in the Rain trailer.jpg|right|thumb|267px|''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' trailer: [[Donald O'Connor]], [[Debbie Reynolds]] and Kelly (1952)]]\n\nThere followed in quick succession two musicals that secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film. First,  ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'' in 1951 and\u2014probably the most popular and admired of all film musicals\u2014''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' in 1952. As co-director, lead star, and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force in both of these films. [[Johnny Green]], the head of music at MGM at the time, said of him,\n\n<blockquote>Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was [[Louis B. Mayer]] or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.<ref name=\"Thomas\" /></blockquote>\n\n''An American in Paris'' won six Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].  The film also marked the debut of nineteen-year-old ballerina [[Leslie Caron]], whom Kelly had spotted in Paris and brought to Hollywood. Its dream ballet sequence, lasting an unprecedented seventeen minutes, was the most expensive production number ever filmed at that time. [[Bosley Crowther]] described it as, \"... whoop-de-doo ... one of the finest ever put on the screen.\"<ref name=\"Hirschhorn\" /> Also in 1951, Kelly received an honorary Academy Award for his contribution to film musicals and the art of choreography.\n\n[[File:Singin' In The Rain Lobby Card 1 (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly from a [[lobby card]] for ''Singin' in the Rain'']]\nThe following year, ''Singin' in the Rain'' featured Kelly's celebrated and much imitated solo dance routine to the title song, along with the \"Moses Supposes\" routine with [[Donald O'Connor]] and the \"Broadway Melody\" finale with [[Cyd Charisse]]. Though the film did not initially generate the same enthusiasm as ''An American in Paris'' had produced, it has subsequently overtaken the earlier film to occupy its current preeminent place among critics and filmgoers alike.<ref>In 1994, [[Kurt Browning]], offered an ice skating interpretation of ''Singin' in the Rain'' on his television special ''You Must Remember This''. In 2005 Kelly's widow gave permission for [[Volkswagen]] to use his likeness to promote the [[Golf GTi]] car. The advertisement, shown only outside the U.S., used [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] to mix footage of Gene Kelly, from ''Singin' in the Rain'', with footage of professional breakdancer [[David Elsewhere]].</ref>\n\n===1953\u201357: The decline of the Hollywood musical===\nAt the peak of his creative powers, Kelly made what in retrospect some see as a mistake.<ref name=\"Hirschhorn\" /> In December 1951, he signed a contract with MGM that sent him to Europe for 19 months to use MGM funds frozen in Europe to make three pictures while personally benefiting from tax exemptions. Only one of these pictures was a musical, ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to the Dance]]'', a pet project of Kelly's to bring modern ballet to mainstream film audiences. It was beset with delays and technical problems, and flopped when finally released in 1956.\n\n[[File:Its Always Fair Weather photo.JPG|thumb|left|[[Michael Kidd]], Kelly, and [[Dan Dailey]] in ''[[It's Always Fair Weather]] (1955), directed by Kelly and [[Stanley Donen]], their last collaboration]]''\n\nWhen Kelly returned to Hollywood in 1953, the film musical was already beginning to feel the pressures from television, and MGM cut the budget for his next picture ''[[Brigadoon (film)|Brigadoon]]'' (1954), with Cyd Charisse, forcing him to make the film on studio back lots instead of on location in Scotland. This year also saw him appear as guest star with his brother Fred in the celebrated ''I Love to Go Swimmin' with Wimmen'' routine in ''[[Deep in My Heart (1954 film)|Deep in My Heart]]''. MGM's refusal to lend him out for ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' and ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' put further strains on his relationship with the studio. He negotiated an exit to his contract that involved making three further pictures for MGM. The first of these, ''[[It's Always Fair Weather]]'' (1956), co-directed with Donen, was a musical satire on television and advertising, and includes his famous roller skate dance routine to ''I Like Myself'', and a dance trio with [[Michael Kidd]] and [[Dan Dailey]] that Kelly used to experiment with the widescreen possibilities of [[Cinemascope]]. MGM had lost faith in Kelly's box-office appeal, and as a result ''It's Always Fair Weather'' \"premiered\" at 17 drive-in theatres around the [[Los Angeles]] metroplex. Next followed Kelly's last musical film for MGM, ''[[Les Girls]]'' (1957), in which he partnered a trio of leading ladies, [[Mitzi Gaynor]], [[Kay Kendall]], and [[Taina Elg]]. It too sold few movie tickets. The third picture he completed was a co-production between MGM and himself, a cheapie B-film, ''[[The Happy Road]]'', set in his beloved France, his first foray in a new role as producer-director-actor. After leaving MGM, Kelly returned to stage work.\n\n===1958\u201396: After MGM===\nIn 1958, Kelly directed [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s musical play ''[[Flower Drum Song]]''.<ref>In an episode foreshadowing his later conflicts with the studio, [[Elia Kazan]] in the late 1940s offered Kelly the role of Biff in ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' on Broadway, but MGM refused to release him. cf. Blair, p.112</ref> Early in 1960, Kelly, an ardent Francophile and fluent French speaker, was invited by A. M. Julien, the general administrator of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Op\u00e9ra]] and [[Op\u00e9ra-Comique]],<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> to select his own material and create a modern ballet for the company, the first time an American had received such an assignment. The result was ''Pas de Dieux'', based on [[Greek mythology]], combined with the music of [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]''. It was a major success, and led to his being honored with the Chevalier of the [[Legion d'Honneur]] by the French Government.\n\n[[File:Inherit the wind trailer (5) Gene Kelly.jpg|thumb|Kelly as Hornbeck in ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'']]\n\nKelly continued to make some film appearances, such as Hornbeck in the 1960 Hollywood production of ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]''. However, most of his efforts were now concentrated on film production and directing. In 1962 he directed [[Jackie Gleason]] in ''[[Gigot (film)|Gigot]]'' in Paris, but the film was drastically re-cut by [[Seven Arts Productions]] and flopped.<ref name=\"Hirschhorn\" /> Another French effort, [[Jacques Demy]]'s homage to the MGM musical, ''[[Les Demoiselles de Rochefort]]'' (1967), in which Kelly appeared, was popular in France and nominated for Academy Awards for Best Music and Score of a Musical Picture (Original or Adaptation), but performed poorly elsewhere. He appeared as himself in [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Let's Make Love]]'' (1960).\n\nHe was asked to direct the film version of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', which had been previously turned down by [[Stanley Donen]]. He escorted Ernest Lehman out of his house, saying \"Go find someone else to direct this piece of shit.\"<ref name=\"wsj\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-sound-of-music-story-by-tom-santopietro-1425069491|title=Book Review: 'The Sound of Music Story' by Tom Santopietro - WSJ|publisher=wsj.com|accessdate=2015-05-18}}</ref>\n\nHis first foray into television was a documentary for [[NBC]]'s ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]'', ''Dancing is a Man's Game'' (1958), where he assembled a group of America's greatest sportsmen\u2014including [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], and [[Bob Cousy]]\u2014and reinterpreted their moves choreographically, as part of his lifelong quest to remove the effeminate stereotype of the art of dance, while articulating the philosophy behind his dance style.<ref name=\"Hirschhorn\" /> It gained an [[Emmy]] nomination for choreography and now stands as the key document explaining Kelly's approach to modern dance.\n\nKelly appeared frequently on television shows during the 1960s, including ''[[Going My Way (TV series)|Going My Way]]'', which was based on the [[Going My Way|1944 film of the same name]]. It enjoyed great popularity in Roman Catholic countries outside the U.S.<ref name=\"Hirschhorn\" /> He also appeared in three major TV specials: ''[[The Julie Andrews Show]]'' (1965), ''New York, New York'' (1966), and ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk (1967 film)|Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' (1967)\u2014a show he produced and directed that again combined cartoon animation and live dance, winning him an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Children's Program.\n\nIn 1963, Kelly joined [[Universal Pictures]] for a two-year stint. He joined [[20th Century Fox]] in 1965, but had little to do\u2014partly due to his decision to decline assignments away from Los Angeles for family reasons. His perseverance finally paid off, with the major box-office hit ''[[A Guide for the Married Man]]'' (1967) where he directed [[Walter Matthau]]. Then, a major opportunity arose when Fox\u2014buoyed by the returns from ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965)\u2014commissioned Kelly to direct ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1969), again directing Matthau along with [[Barbra Streisand]]. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards and won three.\n\nIn 1970, he made another television special: ''Gene Kelly and 50 Girls'' and was invited to bring the show to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]\u2014which he did for an eight-week stint on the condition he be paid more than any artist had ever been paid there.<ref name=\"Hirschhorn\" /> He directed veteran actors [[James Stewart]] and [[Henry Fonda]] in the comedy western ''[[The Cheyenne Social Club]]'' (1970), which performed poorly at the box office. In 1973 he worked again with [[Frank Sinatra]] as part of Sinatra's [[Emmy]] nominated TV special, ''[[Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra]]''. Then, in 1974, he appeared as one of many special narrators in the surprise hit of the year ''[[That's Entertainment!]]''. He subsequently directed and co-starred with his friend [[Fred Astaire]] in the sequel ''[[That's Entertainment, Part II]]'' (1976). It was a measure of his powers of persuasion that he managed to coax the 77-year-old Astaire\u2014who had insisted that his contract rule out any dancing, having long since retired\u2014into performing a series of song and dance duets, evoking a powerful nostalgia for the glory days of the American musical film.\n\nIn 1977, Kelly starred in the poorly received action film ''[[Viva Knievel!]]'', with the popular stuntman, [[Evel Knievel]]. Kelly continued to make frequent TV appearances. His final film role was in ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'' (1980), an expensive theatrical flop that has since attained a cult following.<ref name=\"Hirschhorn\" /> In Kelly's opinion, \"The concept was marvelous but it just didn't come off.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> In the same year, he was invited by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] to recruit a production staff for American Zoetrope's ''[[One from the Heart]]'' (1982). Although Coppola's ambition was for him to establish a production unit to rival the [[Arthur Freed|Freed Unit]] at MGM, the film's failure put an end to this idea.<ref name=\"Hirschhorn\" /> In 1985 Kelly served as executive producer and co-host of ''[[That's Dancing!]]'', a celebration of the history of dance in the American musical. Kelly's final on-screen appearance was to introduce ''[[That's Entertainment! III]]''. His final film project was in 1994 for the animated film ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]'', released in 1997 and dedicated to him, on which Kelly acted as an uncredited choreographic consultant.\n\n==Working methods and influence on filmed dance==\nWhen he began his collaborative film work, he was influenced by [[Robert Alton]] and [[John Murray Anderson]], striving to create moods and character insight with his dances. He choreographed his own movement, along with that of the ensemble, with the assistance of [[Jeanne Coyne]], [[Stanley Donen]], [[Carol Haney]] and Alex Romero.<ref name=\"Billman\">{{cite book | last=Billman | first=Larry | title=Film Choreographers and Dance Directors  | publisher=McFarland and Company | year=1997 | location=North Carolina | pages=374\u2013376 | isbn=0-89950-868-5 }}</ref> He experimented with lighting, camera techniques and special effects in order to achieve true integration of dance with film, and was one of the first to use split screens, double images, live action with animation and is credited as the person who made the ballet form commercially acceptable to film audiences.<ref name=\"Billman\" />\n\nThere was a clear progression in his development, from an early concentration on tap and musical comedy style to greater complexity using ballet and modern dance forms.<ref name=\"Delamater\">{{cite encyclopedia | last=Delamater | first=Jerome | authorlink= | title=Gene Kelly | encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of Dance | volume=vol. 1 | pages=38\u201340 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2004 | url= | accessdate= }}</ref> Kelly himself refused to categorize his style: \"I don't have a name for my style of dancing ... It's certainly hybrid ... I've borrowed from the modern dance, from the classical, and certainly from the American folk dance\u2014tap-dancing, jitterbugging ... But I have tried to develop a style which is indigenous to the environment in which I was reared.\"<ref name=\"Delamater\" /> He especially acknowledged the influence of [[George M. Cohan]]: \"I have a lot of Cohan in me. It's an Irish quality, a jaw-jutting, up-on-the-toes cockiness\u2014which is a good quality for a male dancer to have.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> He was also heavily influenced by an [[African American]] dancer, [[Robert Dotson]], whom he saw perform at [[Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts|Loew's Penn Theatre]] around 1929. He was briefly taught by Frank Harrington, an African American tap specialist from New York.<ref>cf. Hirschhorn, p.25,26: \"What impressed Gene was the originality of the man's [Dotson's] dancing, as it was quite unlike anything he'd seen before. The tricks Dotson was doing were absolutely fresh. He went back to see that act a couple of times, and admitted pinching several steps for his own use ... Just as he had done with Dotson, Gene made up his mind to 'steal' as much as he could from numerous touring shows ... both he and Fred were absolutely shameless when it came to pilfering, and very good at it.\"</ref> However, his main interest was in [[ballet]], which he studied under Kotchetovsky in the early Thirties. As biographer [[Clive Hirschhorn]] explains: \"As a child he used to run for miles through parks and streets and woods\u2014anywhere, just as long as he could feel the wind against his body and through his hair. Ballet gave him the same feeling of exhilaration, and in 1933 he was convinced it was the most satisfying form of self-expression.\"<ref name=\"Hirschhorn\" /> He also studied Spanish dancing under Angel Cansino, [[Rita Hayworth]]'s uncle.<ref name=\"Hirschhorn\" /> Generally speaking, he tended to use tap and other popular dance idioms to express joy and exuberance \u2013 as in the title song from ''Singin' in the Rain'' or \"I Got Rhythm\" from ''An American in Paris'', whereas pensive or romantic feelings were more often expressed via ballet or modern dance, as in \"Heather on the Hill\" from ''Brigadoon'' or \"[[Our Love Is Here to Stay]]\" from ''An American in Paris''.<ref name=\"Delamater\" />\n\n[[File:Kelly in rehearsal.jpg|thumb|Kelly in rehearsal with [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] and assistant [[Jeanne Coyne]] in the [[NBC]] ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]'' television special ''Dancing is a Man's Game'' (1958)]]\nAccording to Delamater, Kelly's work \"seems to represent the fulfillment of dance-film integration in the 1940s and 1950s\". While [[Fred Astaire]] had revolutionized the filming of dance in the 1930s by insisting on full-figure photography of dancers while allowing only a modest degree of camera movement, Kelly freed up the camera, making greater use of space, camera movement, camera angles and editing, creating a partnership between dance movement and camera movement without sacrificing full-figure framing. Kelly's reasoning behind this was that he felt the kinetic force of live dance often evaporated when brought to film, and he sought to partially overcome this by involving the camera in movement and giving the dancer a greater number of directions in which to move. Examples of this abound in Kelly's work and are well illustrated in the \"Prehistoric Man\" sequence from ''On the Town'' and \"The Hat My Father Wore on St. Patrick's Day\" from ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game''.<ref name=\"Delamater\" /> In 1951, he summed up his vision as follows: \"If the camera is to make a contribution at all to dance, this must be the focal point of its contribution; the fluid background, giving each spectator an undistorted and altogether similar view of dancer and background. To accomplish this, the camera is made fluid, moving with the dancer, so that the lens becomes the eye of the spectator, ''your eye''\".<ref name=\"Billman\" />\n\nKelly's athleticism gave his moves a distinctive broad, muscular quality,<ref name=\"Delamater\" /> and this was a very deliberate choice on his part, as he explained: \"There's a strong link between sports and dancing, and my own dancing springs from my early days as an athlete ... I think dancing is a man's game and if he does it well he does it better than a woman.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> He railed against what he saw as the widespread effeminacy in male dancing which, in his opinion, \"tragically\" stigmatized the genre, alienating boys from entering the field: \"Dancing ''does'' attract effeminate young men. I don't object to that as long as they don't dance effeminately. I just say that if a man dances effeminately he dances badly \u2014 just as if a woman comes out on stage and starts to sing bass. Unfortunately, people confuse gracefulness with softness.

You can spot many male dancers who have this tuition by their arm movements\u2014they are soft, limp, and feminine.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> He acknowledged that, in spite of his efforts\u2014in TV programs such as ''Dancing: A Man's Game'' (1958) for example\u2014the situation changed little over the years.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\nHe also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer [[Betsy Blair]] explained: \"A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles ... he democratized the dance in movies.\"<ref>Blair, p.176</ref> In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: \"I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the Manor born\u2014I put them on and look like a truck driver.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriages===\n[[File:Gene Kelly Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|Kelly, photographed by [[Allan Warren]], in 1986]]\nKelly married three times.

His first wife, Betsy Blair, was suspected of being a communist sympathizer, and when United Artists, who had offered Blair a part in ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' (1955), were considering withdrawing her under pressure from the [[American Legion]], Kelly successfully threatened MGM's influence on United Artists with a pullout from ''[[It's Always Fair Weather]]'' unless his wife was restored to the part.<ref name=\"Hirschhorn\" /><ref name=\"Blair\">{{cite book | last=Blair | first=Betsy | title=The Memory of All That | publisher=Elliott & Thompson | year=2004 | location=London | pages= | isbn=1-904027-30-X }}</ref> He used his position on the board of directors of the [[Writers Guild of America West]] on a number of occasions to mediate disputes between unions and the Hollywood studios.\n\nHe was raised as a Roman Catholic, and he was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in [[Beverly Hills, California]].<ref name=\"goodshepherdbh\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goodshepherdbh.org/a-city-on-a-hill/our-history/ |title=Our History &#124; Church of the Good Shepherd |publisher=goodshepherdbh.org|accessdate=2015-05-18}}</ref> However, after becoming disenchanted by the Roman Catholic Church's support for [[Francisco Franco]] against the Second Spanish Republic during the [[Spanish Civil War]],<ref name=ipkmpz>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MKY/is_10_29/ai_n13807354/ |work=Catholic New Times |title=Gene Kelly: cultural icon |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119075803/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MKY/is_10_29/ai_n13807354/ |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}</ref> he officially severed his ties with the church in September 1939.

The genre evolved from [[hardcore rap]] into a distinct form, pioneered in the mid-1980s by rappers such as [[Schoolly D]] and [[Ice-T]], and was popularized in the later part of the 1980s by groups like [[N.W.A]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://rap.about.com/od/genresstyles/p/GangstaRap.htm |title=Gangsta Rap \u2013 What Is Gangsta Rap |publisher=Rap.about.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-03}}</ref> After the national attention that Ice-T and N.W.A attracted in the late 1980s and early 1990s, gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop. Many (if not most) gangsta rap artists openly boast of their associations with various active street gangs as part of their artistic image, with the [[Crips]] and [[Bloods]] being the most commonly represented. Gangsta rap parallels other indigenous gang and crime-oriented forms of music, such as the [[narcocorrido]] genre of northern Mexico.<ref>\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=wLNZ10G5B4sC&pg=PA69&dq=bloods+crips+gangster+rap&hl=en&ei=CzXQTen-DJKo8APKp5XsDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CEsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Gangs and Gang Crime] (2008) Michael Newton\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=uSWq0GaoMfYC&pg=PA59&dq=bloods+crips+gangster+rappers&hl=en&ei=4izSTfKsCcWu8QOPirHdCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CFcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false Gangsters Encyclopedia] page 59, (2007) Michael Newton\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=d-QZIBtgiMYC&pg=PA44&dq=bloods+crips+gangster+rappers&hl=en&ei=4izSTfKsCcWu8QOPirHdCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CGkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false Encyclopedia of gangs] page 44, Louis Kontos, David Brotherton\n*Bloods and Crips: The Genesis of a Genocide: page 42 (2009) Donovan Simmons, Terry Moses\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=rA3KSvabS54C&pg=PA44&dq=bloods+crips+gangster+rappers&hl=en&ei=T0DSTaLhJcOx8QP9xZWHCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFsQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q&f=false The Killing of Tupac Shakur] Cathy Scott</ref>\n\nThe subject matter inherent in gangsta rap has caused a great deal of controversy. Criticism has come from both left-wing and right-wing commentators, as well as [[religious leader]]s, who have accused the genre of promoting [[crime]], [[serial killing]], [[murder]], [[violence]], [[profanity]], [[sex addiction]], [[homophobia]], [[racism]], [[promiscuity]], [[misogyny]], [[rape]], [[street gang]]s, [[disorderly conduct]], [[drive-by shooting]]s, [[vandalism]], [[theft]], [[driving under the influence]], [[drug dealing]], [[alcohol abuse]], [[substance abuse]], [[Contempt of cop|disregarding law enforcement]], [[Economic materialism|materialism]], and [[narcissism]]. [[The White House]] administrations of both [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] criticized the genre.<ref name=\"rap, race, and censorship\">{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=COVER STORY : The Uncivil War : The battle between the Establishment and supporters of rap music reopens old wounds of race and class|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-19/entertainment/ca-4391_1_uncivil-war/2|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 19, 1992|accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> \"Many black rappers\u2014including Ice-T and [[Sister Souljah]]\u2014contend that they are being unfairly singled out because their music reflects deep changes in society not being addressed anywhere else in the public forum. The white politicians, the artists complain, neither understand the music nor desire to hear what's going on in the devastated communities that gave birth to the art form,\" wrote journalist [[Chuck Philips]] in a review of the battle between \"the Establishment\" and defenders of rap music.<ref name=\"rap, race, and censorship\"/> \"The reason why rap is under attack is because it exposes all the contradictions of American culture ... What started out as an underground art form has become a vehicle to expose a lot of critical issues that are not usually discussed in American politics. The problem here is that the White House and wanna-bes like Bill Clinton represent a political system that never intends to deal with inner city urban chaos,\" Sister Souljah told Philips.<ref name=\"rap, race, and censorship\"/>\n\nOn the other hand, some commentators (for example, [[Spike Lee]] in his satirical film ''[[Bamboozled]]'') have criticized gangsta rap as analogous to black [[minstrel show]]s and [[blackface]] performance, in which performers \u2013 both black and white \u2013 were made to look African American, and acted in a stereotypical uncultured and ignorant manner for entertainment. Gangsta rappers often defend themselves by arguing they are describing the reality of inner-city life, and that they are only adopting a character which behaves in ways they do not necessarily endorse. Gangsta rappers are also famous (or infamous) for appearing more hardcore compared to early concepts and themes of hip-hop artists, and are known for saying things that are often considered [[taboo]]; for instance, the gangsta rap group [[N.W.A]] produced the famous \"[[Fuck tha Police]]\" protest song about [[police brutality]] and [[racial profiling]].\n\nIn high-crime areas, putting on these made up personas is life-threatening, but the fact that gangsta rappers told the stories of others is often seen as having earned them respect for raising awareness of the severity of inner-city crime. Many gangsta rappers argue that in the world of their genre exists the emotions and perspectives of a people whose suffering is too often overlooked and belittled by society. Gangsta rap, some argue, was an effect of the various wrongdoings perpetrated against African-Americans in underprivileged neighborhoods. The various riots sparked by the [[Rodney King]] beating and the acquittal of the police officers responsible for the beating sparked anger and outrage in an area that was already at risk. Gangsta rap acted as an outlet so such people could express themselves angrily and not in fear that they were going to be silenced for telling the truth. They often used gangsta rap to tell the stories of their lives, which sometimes included strong violence, hypersexuality, and drug abuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnhUYWbW3jQ |title=Cam'ron on The O'Reilly Factor |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2006-01-27 |accessdate=2015-03-03}}</ref>\n\n==Early gangster themes==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}\nThe 1973 album ''Hustler's Convention'' by Lightnin' Rod and Jaren Clark featured lyrics that deal with street life, including [[pimp]]ing and the hustling of drugs. [[The Last Poets]] member [[Jalal Mansur Nuriddin]] delivers rhyming vocals in the urban slang of his time, and together with the other Last Poets members, was quite influential on later [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] groups, such as [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. Many rappers, such as [[Ice-T]] and [[Mac Dre]], have credited pimp and writer [[Iceberg Slim]] with influencing their rhymes.\n\n[[Rudy Ray Moore]]'s stand-up comedy and films based on his [[Dolemite]] hustler-pimp alter ego also influenced gangsta rap and are still a popular source for samples. Finally, [[blaxploitation]] films of the 1970s, with their vivid depictions of black underworld figures, were a major inspiration as well. For example, the opening skit on [[Snoop Dogg]]'s ''[[Doggystyle]]'' is a homage to the famous bathtub scene in the 1972 film ''[[Super Fly (1972 film)|Super Fly]]'', while the rapper [[Notorious B.I.G.]] took his alias \"Biggie Smalls\" from a character in the 1975 film ''[[Let's Do It Again (1975 film)|Let's Do It Again]]''.\n\n==Origins: 1984\u20131990==\n\n===Beginnings: Ice-T and Schoolly D===\nTracy \"[[Ice-T]]\" Morrow, was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], in 1958. As a teenager, he moved to [[Los Angeles]] where he rose to prominence in the [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast hip hop scene]]. In 1986, [[Ice-T]] released \"[[6 in the Mornin']]\", which is often regarded as among the first gangsta rap songs. Ice-T had been MCing since the early '80s, but first turned to gangsta rap themes after being influenced by [[Philadelphia]] rapper [[Schoolly D]] and his 1985 album ''[[Schoolly D (album)|Schoolly D]]'', often considered to be the originator of gangsta rap. In an interview with PROPS magazine, Ice-T said:\n\n:Here's the exact chronological order of what really went down: The first record that came out along those lines was [[Schoolly D]]'s \"[[P.S.K. What Does It Mean?|P.S.K.]]\" Then the syncopation of that rap was used by me when I made \"6 in the Mornin'\". The vocal delivery was the same: ' ... P.S.K. is makin' that green', ' ... six in the morning, police at my door'. When I heard that record I was like \"Oh @#!*% !\" and call it a bite or what you will but I dug that record. My record didn't sound like P.S.K., but I liked the way he was flowing with it. P.S.K. was talking about Park Side Killers but it was very vague. That was the only difference, when Schoolly did it, it was \"... one by one, I'm knockin' em out.\" All he did was represent a gang on his record. I took that and wrote a record about guns, beating people down, and all that with \"6 in the Mornin'\". At the same time my single came out, [[Boogie Down Productions]] hit with ''[[Criminal Minded]]'', which was a gangster-based album. It wasn't about messages or \"You Must Learn\", it was about gangsterism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daveyd.com/iceprops.html |title=Ice T Interview |publisher=Daveyd.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Ice-T repeated in his autobiography that Schoolly D was his inspiration for gangsta rap.<ref>''Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption\u2014from South Central to Hollywood'', Chapter 8: Six in the Mornin', One World, New York, 2011</ref> Ice-T continued to release gangsta albums for the remainder of the 1980s: ''[[Rhyme Pays]]'' in 1987, ''[[Power (Ice T)|Power]]'' in 1988, and ''[[The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech ... Just Watch What You Say]]'' in 1989. Ice-T's lyrics also contained strong political commentary, and often played the line between glorifying the gangsta lifestyle and criticizing it as a [[no-win situation]].\n\nSchoolly D's debut album, ''Schoolly D'', and especially the song \"[[P.S.K. What Does It Mean?]]\", would heavily influence not only Ice-T, but also [[Eazy-E]] and [[N.W.A]] (most notably in the song \"[[Boyz-n-the-Hood]]\") as well as the [[Beastie Boys]] on their seminal hardcore hip hop-influenced album ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'' (1986).<ref name=hess>{{cite book|last1=Hess|first1=Mickey|title=Hip Hop in America: A Regional Guide|date=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XkCncJ7j744C&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=schoolly+d+influenced+eazy+e&source=bl&ots=r7KMNeNzlE&sig=o4zx1Cts2Y_8Wfh8gqEWfwgHe2Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjRufnk79TJAhVrtoMKHeaOA3oQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&q=schoolly%20d%20influenced%20eazy%20e&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Boogie Down Productions and N.W.A===\n[[Boogie Down Productions]] released their first single, \"Say No Brother (Crack Attack Don't Do It)\", in 1986. It was followed by \"South-Bronx/P is Free\" and \"9mm Goes Bang\" in the same year. The latter is the most gangsta-themed song of the three; in it, [[KRS-One]] boasts about shooting a crack dealer and his posse to death (in self-defense).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohhla.com/anonymous/boogiedp/cri_mind/9mm_goes.bdp.txt |title=The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive |publisher=Ohhla.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-03}}</ref> The album ''[[Criminal Minded]]'' followed in 1987, and was the first rap album to have firearms on its cover. Shortly after the release of this album, BDP's DJ, [[Scott LaRock]] was shot and killed. After this, BDP's subsequent records were more focused with the inadequate rationale removed.\n\nThe first blockbuster gangsta rap album was [[N.W.A]]'s ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in 1988. ''Straight Outta Compton'' would establish West Coast hip hop as a vital genre, and establish Los Angeles as a legitimate rival to hip hop's long-time capital, New York City. ''Straight Outta Compton'' sparked the first major controversy regarding hip hop lyrics when their song \"[[Fuck tha Police]]\" earned a letter from [[FBI]] Assistant Director, Milt Ahlerich, strongly expressing [[police|law enforcement]]'s resentment of the song.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ryan |last=Ritchie |title=Eazy to be hard |url=http://www.presstelegram.com/entertainment/ci_5315527 |work=Press Telegram |publisher=Los Angeles Newspaper group |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2008-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304170024/http://www.presstelegram.com/entertainment/ci_5315527 |archivedate=March 4, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Rap, Rock, and Censorship: Popular Culture and the Technologies of Justice. |last=Deflem |first=Mathieu |url=http://deflem.blogspot.com/1993/08/rap-rock-and-censorship-1993.html |accessdate=2012-10-06 |year=1993 }}</ref> Due to the influence of Ice-T, N.W.A, and [[Ice Cube]]'s early solo career, gangsta rap is often somewhat erroneously credited as being a mostly [[West Coast rap|West Coast]] phenomenon, despite the contributions of East Coast acts like Boogie Down Productions in shaping the genre and despite Philadelphia rapper Schoolly D being generally regarded as the first gangsta rapper.\n\nIn the early 1990s, former N.W.A member [[Ice Cube]] would further influence gangsta rap with his hardcore, socio-political solo albums, which suggested the potential of gangsta rap as a political medium to give voice to inner-city youth. N.W.A's second album, ''[[Efil4zaggin]]'' (1991) (released after Ice Cube's departure from the group), broke ground as the first gangsta rap album to reach #1 on the Billboard pop charts.\n\n===Others===\nAside from N.W.A and Ice T, [[Too Short]] (from [[Oakland, California]]), [[Frost (rapper)|Kid Frost]], and the [[South Gate, California|South Gate]]-based Latino group [[Cypress Hill]] were pioneering West Coast rappers with gangsta rap songs and themes. [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]] also played an important role in the gangsta rap movement, as their 1990 debut album ''[[Livin' Like Hustlers]]'', as well as their guest appearance on N.W.A's 1991 ''[[Efil4zaggin]]'', foreshadowing the dominance of the genre in 1990s starting with Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]''.\n\nThe [[Beastie Boys]] were one of the first groups to identify themselves as \"[[gangsters]]\", and one of the first popular rap groups to talk about violence and drug and alcohol use, though largely in a more humorous manner. They had started out as a [[hardcore punk]] band, but after introduction to producer [[Rick Rubin]] and the exit of [[Kate Schellenbach]] they became a rap group.<ref>[http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/beastie-boys-2011-5/ Rude Boys], Amos Barshad, New York magazine 2011 5, retr 2012 Oct</ref> According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' Magazine, their 1986 album ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'' is \"filled with enough references to guns, drugs, and empty sex (including the pornographic deployment of a [[Wiffleball]] bat in \"[[Paul Revere (song)|Paul Revere]]\") to qualify as a gangsta-rap cornerstone.\"<ref>''The New Rolling Stone Album Guide'', Fourth Edition</ref>\n\nThe Beasties' 1989 album ''[[Paul's Boutique]]'' included the similarly themed tracks \"Car Thief,\" \"Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun,\" and \"High-Plains Drifter.\" In 1986, the Los Angeles-based group [[C.I.A. (group)|C.I.A.]] rapped over Beastie Boy tracks for songs such as \"My Posse\" and \"Ill-Legal\", and the Beastie Boys' influence can be seen significantly in N.W.A's early albums.<ref>Chang, Jeff. ''Can't Stop, Won't Stop: The History of the Hip Hop Generation''</ref>\n\nThe New York rap group [[Run DMC]] is often credited with popularizing hardcore and confrontational attitudes and lyrics in hip hop culture, and were one of the first rap groups to dress in gang-like street clothing. Their stripped-down, rock-inspired beats were also important in establishing the early gangsta rap production style. The seminal Long Island-based group [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] featured aggressive, politically charged lyrics, which had an especially strong influence on gangsta rappers such as [[Ice Cube]]. East Coast hardcore rappers like [[Rakim]], [[Kool G Rap]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Slick Rick]], [[LL Cool J]], and [[EPMD]] also reflected the trend in hip-hop music in the late 1980s towards hard-hitting, angry, aggressive, and politically conscious lyrics, revolving around crime, violence, poverty, war and gunplay.\n\nThe [[Houston]]-based group known as the [[Geto Boys]] came out around the late 1980s and made songs containing both gangsta themes of crime and violence and sociopolitical commentary. The group notably released proto-[[mafioso rap]] music with the song \"Scarface\", a track centered on selling [[cocaine]] and killing rival gang members. The Geto Boys are also known for being the first rap group to sample from the movie ''[[Scarface (1983 movie)|Scarface]]'', a film which became the basis for various mafioso rap samples in the 1990s. Furthermore, the Geto Boys, along with [[Jam Master J]]'s and [[Erick Sermon]]'s group [[Flatlinerz]] and [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]]'s and [[RZA]]'s group [[Gravediggaz]], are often cited as pioneers of \"[[horrorcore]]\" rap, a [[Transgressive art|transgressive]] and abrasive subgenre of hardcore rap or gangsta rap which focuses on common [[Horror fiction|horror]] themes, such as the [[supernatural]] and the [[occult]], often with [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] or [[macabre]] lyrics, [[Satanism|satanic]] imagery, and [[slasher film]] or [[splatter film]]-like violence.\n\n==1990\u2013present==\n\n===Ice-T===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ice-T-O.G. Original Gangster (album cover).jpg|thumb|left|Ice-T's ''O.G. Original Gangster''.]] -->\n[[Ice-T]] released one of the seminal albums of the genre, ''[[OG: Original Gangster]]'' in 1991. It also contained a song by his new [[thrash metal]] group [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]], who released a [[Body Count (album)|self titled album]] in 1992. Particular controversy surrounded one of its songs \"[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]\". The rock song was intended to speak from the viewpoint of a police target seeking revenge on racist, brutal cops. Ice-T's rock song infuriated government officials, the [[National Rifle Association]] and various police advocacy groups.<ref name=\"Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator.

Ice-T suggested that the furor over the song was an overreaction, telling journalist [[Chuck Philips]] \"... they've done movies about nurse killers and teacher killers and student killers. Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don't hear anybody complaining about that.\" In the same interview, Ice-T suggested to Philips that the misunderstanding of ''Cop Killer'', the misclassification of it as a rap song (not a rock song), and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones: \"The Supreme Court says it's OK for a white man to burn a cross in public. But nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer.\"<ref name=\"Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don't hear anybody complaining\"/>\n\nIce-T's next album, ''[[Home Invasion (album)|Home Invasion]]'' was postponed as a result of the controversy, and was finally released in 1993. While it contained gangsta elements, it was his most [[political hip hop|political]] album to date. After a proposed censoring of the ''[[Home Invasion (album)|Home Invasion]]'' album cover art, he left [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Ice-T's subsequent releases went back to straight gangsta-ism, but were never as popular as his earlier releases. He had alienated his core audience with his involvement in metal, his emphasis on politics and with his uptempo Bomb-Squad style beats during a time when [[G-funk]] was popular. He published a book \"The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a @#!*% ?\" in 1994.\n\n===G-funk and Death Row Records===\n{{Main|G-Funk}}\nIn 1992, former N.W.A member [[Dr. Dre]] released ''[[The Chronic]]'', a massive seller (eventually going triple platinum) which showed that explicit gangsta rap could hold mass commercial appeal just like more pop-oriented rappers such as [[MC Hammer]], [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince|The Fresh Prince]], and [[Tone L\u014dc]]. The album established the dominance of West Coast gangsta rap and Dre's new post-N.W.A label, [[Death Row Records]] (owned by Dr. Dre along with [[Marion \"Suge\" Knight]]), as Dre's album showcased a stable of promising new Death Row rappers. The album also began the subgenre of G-funk, a slow, drawled form of hip hop that dominated the rap charts for some time.<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Dr.DreTheChronic.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. Dre's ''The Chronic''.]]  -->\n\nExtensively sampling [[P-Funk]] bands, especially [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]], G-funk was multi-layered, yet simple and easy to dance to. The simple message of its lyrics, that life's problems could be overcome by guns, alcohol, and marijuana, endeared it to a teenage audience. The single \"[[Nuthin' but a \"G\" Thang]]\" became a crossover hit, with its humorous, ''[[House Party (film)|House Party]]''-influenced video becoming an MTV staple despite that network's historic orientation towards rock music.\n\nAnother success was [[Ice Cube]]'s ''[[The Predator (1992 album)|Predator]]'' album, released at about the same time as ''The Chronic'' in 1992. It sold over 5 million copies and was #1 in the charts, propelled by the hit single \"[[It Was a Good Day]]\", despite the fact that Ice Cube was not a Death Row artist. One of the genre's biggest crossover stars was Dre's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop Doggy Dogg]] (''[[Doggystyle]]''), whose exuberant, party-oriented themes made songs such as \"[[Gin and Juice]]\" club anthems and top hits nationwide. In 1996, [[2Pac]] signed with Death Row and released the multi-platinum double album ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. Not long afterward, his shocking murder brought gangsta rap into the national headlines and propelled his posthumous ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]'' album (released under the alias \"Makaveli\") (which eerily featured an image of 2Pac being crucified on the front cover) to the top of the charts. [[Warren G]] was another G-funk musician along with the now deceased [[Nate Dogg]]. Other successful G-Funk influenced artists included [[Spice 1]], [[MC Eiht]] and [[MC Ren]], all of them reaching decent positions on the Billboard 100, in spite of not being associated with Death Row.\n\n===Mafioso rap===\nMafioso rap is a [[hardcore hip hop]] subgenre founded by [[Kool G Rap]] in the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/only-built-4-cuban-linx-mw0000171262 |title=Only Built 4 Cuban Linx - Raekwon |website=Allmusic.com |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}</ref> It is the pseudo-[[Mafia]] extension of East Coast hardcore rap, and is considered{{by whom|date=June 2015}} the counterpart of West Coast [[G-Funk]] rap. Mafioso rap is characterized by references to famous [[Gangster|mobsters]] and [[mafiosi]], [[racketeering]], and [[organized crime]] in general (but especially the [[Italian-American Mafia]], the [[Sicilian Mafia]], [[African-American organized crime]], and [[Latin American]] organized crime or [[drug cartel]]s). Though some mafioso rap was more gritty and street-oriented, many other mafioso rap artists frequently focused on lavish, self-indulgent, [[Economic materialism|materialistic]], and luxurious subject matter, such as expensive drugs, cars, and expensive [[champagne]]. Though the genre died down for several years, it re-emerged in 1995 when [[Wu-Tang Clan]] member [[Raekwon]] released his critically acclaimed solo album, ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]''. 1995 also saw the release of ''[[Doe or Die]]'' by [[Nas]]' prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]] and the release of the album ''[[4,5,6]]'' by subgenre originator [[Kool G Rap]]. This album featured other mafioso rap artists [[MF Grimm]], [[Nas]] and B-1. These three albums brought the genre to mainstream recognition, and inspired other East Coast artists, such as [[Jay-Z]], [[Notorious B.I.G.]] and [[Nas]], to adopt the same themes as well with their albums ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]'', ''[[Life After Death]]'' and ''[[It Was Written]]'' (respectively). Though Mafioso rap declined in the mainstream by the late 1990s, it saw somewhat of a revival in the mid 2000s{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} with [[Ghostface Killah]]'s ''[[Fishscale]]'', [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[American Gangster (album)|American Gangster]]'', and [[Raekwon]]'s ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II]]''. Similarly, in recent years,{{when|date=June 2015}} many rappers, such as [[T.I.]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Fabolous]], [[Jadakiss]], [[Jim Jones]], and [[Cassidy (rapper)|Cassidy]] have maintained popularity with lyrics about self-centered urban criminal lifestyles or \"hustling\". [[Lil' Kim]]'s mafioso album ''[[La Bella Mafia]]'', released in 2003, was a commercial success, receiving platinum certification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database - March 03, 2015 |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=2015-03-03}}</ref>\n\n===East Coast hardcore hip hop and the East Coast\u2013West Coast feud===\nMeanwhile, rappers from New York City, such as [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Onyx (band)|Onyx]], [[Big L]], [[Mobb Deep]], [[Nas]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Lil' Kim]], and [[The L.O.X]], among others, pioneered a grittier sound known as East Coast [[hardcore hip hop]]. In 1994, both [[Nas]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] released their debut albums ''[[Illmatic]]'' and ''[[Ready to Die]]'' respectively, which paved the way for New York City to take back dominance from the West Coast. In an interview for ''[[The Independent]]'' in 1994, the Wu-Tang Clan's [[GZA]] commented on the term \"gangsta rap\" and its association with his group's music and hip hop at the time:\n\n{{quote|Our music is not 'gangsta rap'. There's no such thing. The label was created by the media to limit what we can say. We just deliver the truth in a brutal fashion. The young black male is a target. Snoop (Doggy Dogg) has gone four times platinum and makes more money than the president. They don't like that, so you hear 'ban this, ban that'. We attack people's emotions.

Dr. Dre, at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], claimed that \"gangsta rap was dead\". While Puff Daddy's Bad Boy Entertainment fared better than its West Coast rival, it eventually began to lose popularity and support by the end of the decade, due to its pursuit of a more mainstream sound, as well as challenges from [[Atlanta]] and New Orleans-based labels, especially, [[Master P]]'s [[No Limit Records|No Limit]] stable of popular rappers.\n\n===Southern and Midwestern gangsta rap===\nAfter the deaths of [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[Biggie Smalls]] and the media attention the murders generated,<ref>[http://womenincrimeink.blogspot.com/2011/01/biggie-smalls-and-tupac-shakur-murder.html \"Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur Cold Cases Heat Up,\"] ''[[Women in Crime Ink]]'' 2011-01-11</ref> gangsta rap became an even greater commercial force. However, most of the industry's major labels were in turmoil, bankrupt, or creatively stagnant, and new labels representing the rap scenes in new locations sprang up.\n\nMaster P's No Limit Records label, based out of New Orleans, became quite popular in the late 1990s, though critical success was very scarce, with the exceptions of some later additions like [[Mystikal]] (''[[Ghetto Fabulous (album)|Ghetto Fabulous]]'', 1998). No Limit had begun its rise to national popularity with Master P's ''[[The Ghetto Is Trying to Kill Me!]]'' ([[1994 in music|1994]]), and had major hits with [[Silkk the Shocker]] (''[[Charge It 2 Da Game]]'', 1998) and [[C Miller|C-Murder]] (''[[Life or Death (C-Murder album)|Life or Death]]'', 1998). [[Cash Money Records]], also based out of New Orleans, had enormous commercial success beginning in the late 1990s with a similar musical style but utilized a quality-over-quantity business approach unlike No Limit.\n\n[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] collective [[Hypnotize Minds]], led by [[Three 6 Mafia]] and [[Project Pat]], have taken gangsta rap to some of its darker extremes. Led by in-house producers [[DJ Paul]] and [[Juicy J]], the label became known for its pulsating, menacing beats and uncompromisingly thuggish lyrics. However, in the mid-2000s, the group began attaining more mainstream popularity, eventually culminating in the [[Three 6 Mafia]] winning an [[Academy Award]] for the song \"[[It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp]]\" from ''[[Hustle and Flow]]''.\n\nMidwest gangsta rap originated in the mid-1990s and rose to major prominence in the 2000s. However, in the 2010s a new form of gangsta rap known as [[drill (music genre)|drill]] emerged from the Midwest. Drill gained popularity by rappers such as [[Lil Durk]], [[Chief Keef]], [[Lil Reese]], and [[Lil Herb]]. [[Midwest Hip Hop]] was originally distinctive for its faster-paced flow. This is evident in the styles of the earliest Midwestern rappers to release albums, Chicago's [[Twista]] and Cleveland's [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]]. Bone Thugs, known for their fast, harmonizing vocals coupled with an ultra-quick rap delivery, would achieve major success with their critically acclaimed 1995 album ''[[E 1999 Eternal]]'', which featured a major hit in the Grammy-winning \"[[Tha Crossroads]]\".\n\n[[Houston]] first came on to the national scene in the late 1980s with the violent and disturbing stories told by the [[Geto Boys]], with member [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]] achieving major solo success in the mid-90s.\n\nThe [[Chopped and Screwed]] genre was developed in [[Houston]], Texas which remains the location most associated with the style. The late [[DJ Screw]], a South Houston DJ, is credited with the creation of and early experimentation with the genre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2013/03/10-chopped-and-screwed-songs-that-never-get-old/ |title=10 CHOPPED AND SCREWED SONGS THAT NEVER GET OLD |author=Briana Cheng |publisher=Pigeons and Planes |accessdate=2016-02-12}}</ref> DJ Screw began making mixtapes of the slowed-down music in the early 1990s and began the [[Screwed Up Click]]. This provided a significant outlet for MCs in the South-Houston area, and helped local rappers such as [[Big Moe]], [[Lil' Flip]], [[E.S.G. (rapper)|E.S.G.]], [[UGK]], [[Lil' Keke]], [[South Park Mexican]], [[Spice 1]] and [[Z-Ro]] gain regional and sometimes national prominence.\n\n===Narco-rap===\nNarco-rap is a music scene, similar to the early underground [[gangsta-rap]] scene, that emerged in northeastern Mexico and southern [[Texas]]. Its lyrical content, popular among Latino youth, is violent and focuses on the power of drug cartels and the gruesomeness of the [[Mexican Drug War|drug war]] in the border region. Narco-rap emerged in the urban area of Tamaulipas, a turf currently under armed dispute between [[the Zetas]] and the [[Gulf Cartel]]. Narco-rappers sing about the life of mobsters and the reality of the cities under the cartel's rule. Some of the key players of the genre are [[Samuel Flores Borrego#Narco-Rap legacy|Cano y Blunt]], DemenT and Big Los.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/es_mx/read/en-tamaulipas-los-narcos-disparan-a-ritmo-de-rap-0000156-v5n4|title=En Tamaulipas los narcos disparan a ritmo de rap - VICE - M\u00e9xico|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/06/23/hfr-el-narco-rap-la-banda-sonora-del-horror-en-reynosa|title=El ''narco-rap'', la banda sonora del horror en Reynosa|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131031413/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/06/23/hfr-el-narco-rap-la-banda-sonora-del-horror-en-reynosa|archivedate=January 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://diario.mx/El_Paso/2013-06-16_0ee2cdd6/se-suman-los-raperos-norteamericanos-a-la-ola-narco/|title=Se suman los raperos norteamericanos a la 'ola narco'|author=Luis Chaparro}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevoheraldo.com/el_valle/noticias_locales/mcallen-reynosa-la-maldosa/article_b3e9d5da-e8e4-11e2-b83d-0019bb30f31a.html|title=McALLEN: 'Reynosa la Maldosa'|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2013/06/us-rappers-dedicate-their-songs-to.html|title=Borderland Beat: US Rappers Dedicate Their Songs to Mexican Drug Lords|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/mexicos-narco-rappers-are-here-to-stay-cano-blunt-interview-reynosa|title=Mexico's Narco Rappers Are Here to Stay - VICE - United Kingdom|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nuestraaparenterendicion.com/index.php/biblioteca/cronicas-y-reportajes/item/962-voy-a-morir-porque-creen-que-soy-un-zeta|title=Voy a morir porque creen que soy un Zeta|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Mainstream rap===\nBefore the late 1990s, gangsta rap, while a huge-selling genre, had been regarded as well outside of the pop mainstream, committed to representing the experience of the inner-city and not \"selling out\" to the pop charts. However, the rise of Bad Boy Records, propelled by the massive crossover success of Bad Boy head [[Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]]'s 1997 ensemble album, ''[[No Way Out (Puff Daddy album)|No Way Out]]'', on the heels of the media attention generated by the murders of [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], signaled a major stylistic change in gangsta rap (or as it is referred to on the East Coast, hardcore rap), as it morphed into a new subgenre of hip hop which would become even more commercially successful and popularly accepted.\n\nThe earlier, somewhat controversial crossover success enjoyed by popular gangsta rap songs like \"[[Gin and Juice]]\" gave way to gangsta rap's becoming a widely accepted staple on the pop charts in the late 1990s. For example, between the release of The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut album ''[[Ready to Die]]'' in 1994 and his follow-up, the posthumous ''[[Life After Death]]'' in 1997, his sound changed from a darker, tense production, with lyrics projecting desperation and paranoia, to a cleaner, more laid-back sound, fashioned for popular consumption (though the references to guns, drug dealing and life as a thug on the street remained).\n\n[[R&B]]-styled hooks and instantly recognizable samples of well-known [[soul music|soul]] and pop songs from the 1970s and 1980s were the staples of this sound, which was showcased primarily in [[Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]]'s latter-day production work for The Notorious B.I.G. (\"[[Mo Money, Mo Problems]]\"), [[Mase]] (\"[[Feel So Good (song)|Feels So Good]]\"), and non-Bad Boy artists such as [[Jay-Z]] (\"[[Can I Get A ...]]\") and [[Nas]] (\"[[Street Dreams (song)|Street Dreams]]\"). Also achieving similar levels of success with a similar sound at the same time as Bad Boy was [[Master P]] and his No Limit label in New Orleans, as well as the New Orleans upstart Cash Money label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/soulja-boy-rockstar-new-mixtape.116492.html?song-111643 |title=Rockstar Souljah Boy mixtape |last=Lilah |first=Rose |date=August 1, 2016 |website=Hotnewhiphop |access-date=August 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany of the artists who achieved such mainstream success in the 2000s, such as [[Jay-Z]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], then [[50 Cent]] and [[G-Unit]], originated from the gritty 1990s East Coast rap scene and were influenced by hardcore artists such as [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], and [[Nas]]. [[Mase]] and [[Cam'ron]] were typical of a more relaxed, casual flow that became the pop-gangsta norm. By contrast, other rappers like [[Eminem]] and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] enjoyed commercial success in the late 1990s by rapping about ever-more macabre tales of death and violence, maintaining commercial relevance by attempting to be controversial and subversive, growing on the [[Horrorcore]] rap style born in the late 1980s.\n\nGangsta rap's pioneers have met success in other forms of pop culture as well.

There is also debate about the [[Causality|causation]] between gangsta rap and real-world crime.\n\nCritics of gangsta rap hold that it glorifies and encourages criminal behavior, and may be at least partially to blame for the problem of street gangs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/11/14/is-gangsta-rap-hurting-america-children.html|title=Is Gangsta Rap Hurting America's Children? - Fox News|date=November 14, 2003|publisher=}}</ref> Although this view is often stereotyped as that of [[White American|white]] [[conservatism|conservatives]], it has been shared by members of the [[African-American|black]] community, most notably [[Bill Cosby]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realtalkny.uproxx.com/2007/10/topic/topic/news/video-bill-cosby-speaks-on-gangster-rap-the-youth/|title=Video: Bill Cosby Speaks On Gangster Rap & The Youth|date=October 15, 2007|publisher=|access-date=November 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208133239/http://realtalkny.uproxx.com/2007/10/topic/topic/news/video-bill-cosby-speaks-on-gangster-rap-the-youth/|archive-date=December 8, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThose who are supportive or at least less critical of gangsta rap hold that crime on the street level is for the most part a reaction to [[poverty]] and that gangsta rap reflects the reality of lower class life. Many believe that the blaming of crime on gangsta rap is a form of unwarranted [[moral panic]]; [[The World Development Report 2011]], for instance, confirmed that most street gang members maintain that poverty and unemployment is what drove them to crime; none made reference to music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDRS/Resources/WDR2011_Full_Text.pdf |title=Conflict, Security, and Development |newspaper=Siteresources.worldbank.org |date=2011 |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Ice Cube (rapper)|Ice Cube]] famously satirized the blame placed on gangsta rap for social ills in his song \"[[Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It]]\".\n\nMoreover, English scholar Ronald A.T. Judy has argued that gangsta rap reflects the experience of blackness at the end of political economy, when capital is no longer wholly produced by human labor but in a globalized system of commodities.<ref>Judy, 1994, p. 211-230.</ref> In this economy, gangsta rap traffics blackness as a commodifiable affect of \"being a nigga\".<ref>Judy, 1994, 227.</ref> In other words, gangsta rap defines the experience of blackness, in which he locates in gangsta rap's deployment of the word \"nigga\", in this new global economic system as \"adaptation to the force of commodification\".<ref>Judy, 1994, 229.</ref> For Judy, ''nigga'' (and gangsta rap) becomes an epistemologically authentic category for describing the condition of being black in the modern \"realm of things\".\n\nDespite this, many who hold that gangsta rap is not responsible for social ills are critical of the way many gangsta rappers intentionally exaggerate their criminal pasts for the sake of [[street credibility]]. [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.7847/title.rick-ross-admits-correctional-officer-past|title=Rick Ross Admits Correctional Officer Past|first=HipHopDX -|last=http://hiphopdx.com|publisher=}}</ref> and [[Slim Jesus]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mic.com/articles/125023/slim-jesus-new-video-drill-time-is-being-hilariously-destroyed-by-the-internet|title=Slim Jesus' New Video \"Drill Time\" Is Being Hilariously Destroyed by the Internet|first=|last=Mic|publisher=}}</ref> among others have been heavily criticized for this and the gangster rap music has declined in sales and waned in popularity due to piracy.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===''2Pacalypse Now'' controversy===\nIn 1992, then-U.S. Vice President [[Dan Quayle]] blasted the recording industry for producing [[rap music]] he believed led to violence. Quayle called on [[Time Warner Inc.]] subsidiary, [[Interscope Records]], to withdraw [[Tupac Shakur]]'s 1991 debut album ''[[2Pacalypse Now]]'' from stores. Quayle stated, \"There is absolutely no reason for a record like this to be published\u2014It has no place in our society.\" Quayle's motivation came in light of the murder of a Texas state trooper Bill Davidson, who had been shot by [[Ronald Ray Howard]] after he had been pulled over. Howard was driving a stolen vehicle while songs from ''2Pacalypse Now'' were playing on the tape deck when he was stopped by the officer. The family of Davidson filed a civil suit against Shakur and Interscope Records, claiming the record's violent lyrics incite \"imminent lawless action\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-23/news/mn-1144_1_rap-album|title=Quayle Calls for Pulling Rap Album Tied to Murder Case|first=JOHN|last=BRODER|date=September 23, 1992|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref> District Judge John D.

Delores Tucker===\n\nPoliticians such as [[C. Delores Tucker]] have cited concerns with sexually explicit and misogynistic lyrics featured in [[hip-hop]] tracks. Tucker claimed the explicit lyrics used in hip-hop songs were threatening to the African-American community. Tucker, who once was the highest-ranking African American woman in the Pennsylvania state government, focused on rap music in 1993, labeling it as \"pornographic filth\" and claiming it was offensive and demeaning to black women. Tucker stated, \"You can't listen to all that language and filth without it affecting you.\" Tucker also handed out leaflets containing lyrics from rap music and urged people to read them aloud. She picketed stores that sold the music and handed out petitions. She then proceeded to buy stock in [[Time Warner]], [[Sony]], and other companies for the sole purpose to protest rap music at shareholders meetings. In 1994, Tucker protested when the [[NAACP]] nominated rapper [[Tupac Shakur]] for one of its image awards as Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture from his role in ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]''. Some rappers labeled her \"narrow-minded\", and some ridiculed her in their lyrics, notably Shakur, who mentions her multiple times in his diamond certified 1996 album ''[[All Eyez On Me]]''. Shakur mentions Tucker in the tracks \"Wonda Why They Call U Bitch\", and \"How Do U Want It\", where Shakur sings \"Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker/Instead of trying to help a nigga you destroy a brother.\" Tucker filed a $10 million lawsuit against Shakur's estate for the comments made in both songs. In her lawsuit, she claimed that the comments were slanderous, caused her emotional distress and invaded her personal privacy. The case was eventually dismissed. Shakur wasn't the only rap artist to mention her in his songs, as [[Jay-Z]], [[Eminem]], [[Lil' Kim]], [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] and [[Lil Wayne]] have all previously criticized Tucker for her opposition of the genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/13/AR2005101300024.html|title=C.

Contextually and musically, it borrows its influences from the French and US-based gangsta rap and [[battle rap]]. Although there is a certain correlation between street-rap and gangster-rap, gangster-rap is not considered as a derivative genre since it is only partially related to street-rap and has contextually little to do with the other subgenre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.16bars.de/magazin/1846/von-messerstechern-zu-moral-aposteln-der-wandel-des-strassenraps-teil-iv/ |title=Von Messerstechern Zu Moral Aposteln Der Wandel Des Strassenraps Teil IV |date=2009-06-20 |access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref>\n\n===History===\n\nPioneers of the subgenre gangsta-rap, who have since the '90s still been active, are [[Kool Savas]] and [[Azad (rapper)|Azad]].

Germany at the time, however, did not have a lot of rappers active in this subgenre; allowing certain artists in the Berlin underground-hip-hop scene an opportunity to establish themselves with their lyrics representing a certain hardship acquired through the criminal lifestyle which had previously been popularized. Recognizable names from the underground scene are [[Bass Sultan Hengzt]], [[Fler]], [[MC Bogy]] or [[MOK]]. Another notable rapper and pioneer of gangsta-rap in Germany is Azad. Although he came from the rural [[Frankfurt am Main]], he was a big reason this subgenre became popular in Germany. In his lyrical text, he thematized the rigid and rough lifestyle of living in the northwest district of Frankfurt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/kultur/musik/hip-hop-spricht-die-penislaenge-als-freiheitsmass-618745.html/|title=Die Penisl\u00e4nge als Freiheitsma\u00df|author=Johannes Gernert|date=2008-04-29|access-date=2017-12-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217183005/http://www.stern.de/kultur/musik/hip-hop-spricht-die-penislaenge-als-freiheitsmass-618745.html|archivedate=February 17, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the year 2003 the process of commercialization of this subgenre began. Contrary to popular belief, a variable of the German gangsta-rap became popular before the actual subgenre itself did. When [[Sido (rapper)|Sido]], a notoriously known rapper from Berlin, released his album ''[[Maske]]'' which thematized gangs, drugs, and violence, this album became the first of its genre to sell 100,000 copies. Following that album Sido released another two named ''[[Ich (album)|Ich]]'' and ''[[Ich und meine Maske]]'' which both had over 100,000 sold copies and emphasized the success of his first album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musikindustrie.de/gold_platin_datenbank/www.musikindustrie.de|title=Die Penisl\u00e4nge als Freiheitsma\u00df|author=musikindustrie|access-date=2017-12-04}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/musik/rap-star-massiv-ein-monster-lernt-zu-lieben-a-614256.html|title=Ein Monster lernt zu lieben|author=Philipp Oehmke|date=2009-03-23|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/musik/hiphop-ruepel-sido-den-faxen-entwachsen-a-557195.html|title=Den Faxen entwachsen |author=Markus Schneider|date=2008-06-08|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of Sido and his albums, [[Bushido (rapper)|Bushido]] became the next artist to emerge from the German gangsta-rap scene. He established himself a career and became the most important representative of German gangsta-rap of his time. [[Aggro Berlin]], the label those two artists were both represented by, stated that this version of rap was the second, more aggressive evolution of German hip-hop.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faz.net/sonntagszeitung/uebelst-tolerant-1460012.html|title=\"\u00dcbelst tolerant\"|author=Martin Wittman|date=2007-07-21|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref>\nBushido's albums ''[[Carlo, Cokxxx, Nutten]]'' with Fler and Bushido's debut album ''[[Vom Bordstein bis zur Skyline]]'' had relatively little success although the prominent topics on his album reflected directly with the themes that made Sido popular.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laut.de/Bushido#infos/|title=Bushido}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laut.de/Bushido/Vom-Bordstein-Bis-Zur-Skyline-(Album)/|title=Vom Bordstein Bis Zur Skyline|author=Stefan Johannesberg|date=2003-08-14|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the continuous success of Sido and Bushido came a wave of rappers who were trying, with the help of major-labels, to establish themselves and be recognized by the populace. Eventually came [[Massiv (rapper)|Massiv]], who was signed with Sony BMG, and was crowned by his label to be the German [[50 Cent]]. This artist did not reach the success of 50 Cent.<ref name=\"SPON-528792\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/angriff-in-berlin-schuesse-auf-massiv-wurden-minuten-spaeter-im-internet-vermeldet-a-528792/|title=Sch\u00fcsse auf Massiv wurden Minuten sp\u00e4ter im Internet vermeldet|author=Matthias Gebauer|date=2008-01-15|access-date=2017-12-04}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Further artists such as [[Baba Saad]] or [[Kollegah]] have since then established themselves as relatively successful in the German charts. As of recently, names such as [[Farid Bang]], [[Nate57]], [[Majoe & Jasko]] and [[Haftbefehl (rapper)|Haftbefehl]] have appeared on the charts regularly.\n\n===Musical style===\nGangsta-rap in Germany originated from Queensbridge-rap in the 1990s as well as French gansta-rap. Characteristically the necessary ambiance and melody for this type of hip-hop needs to be melancholic, dark, and often threatening. Often, the songs incorporate piano, choir, synthesizers, but also [[Sample (music)|samples]] from classical and neo-classical arrangements. All complexities such as minimalistic arrangements to vast orchestral symphonic arrangements are used and sampled in this subgenre.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal|last1=Judy|first1=R.

It has been variously translated as ''co-ordination'',{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=381}}{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=479}}{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=272}}  ''[[Nazification]] of state and society'',{{sfn|Hirschfeld|2014|pp=101, 164}} ''synchronization'',{{sfn|Tyson|2010}} and ''bringing into line'',{{sfn|Hirschfeld|2014|pages=101, 164}} but English texts often use the untranslated German word to convey its unique historical meaning.\n\n==Legal basis==\n\nThe Nazis were able to put ''{{lang|de|Gleichschaltung}}'' into effect due to the legal measures taken by the government during the 20 months following 30 January 1933, when [[Adolf Hitler]] became [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=381-90}}\n\nOne day after the [[Reichstag fire]] on 27 February 1933, [[Reichspr\u00e4sident|President of Germany]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]], acting at Hitler's request and on the basis of the emergency powers in [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|article 48]] of the [[Weimar Constitution]], issued the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]]. This decree suspended most [[citizen rights]] provided for by the constitution and thus allowed for the arrest of political adversaries, mostly [[Communists]], and for terrorizing of other electors by the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] (the Nazi paramilitary force) before the upcoming election.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=332-33}}\n\nIn this atmosphere the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' [[German federal election, March 1933|general election]] of 5 March 1933 took place. The Nazis had hoped to win an outright majority and push aside their [[coalition government|coalition partners]], the [[German National People's Party]].  However, the Nazis won only 43 percent of the vote, well short of a majority.  The Nazi-DNVP coalition did enjoy a slim majority, just enough to conduct the ordinary business of government.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=289-301}} A [[Elections in the Free State of Prussia|state election]] was held in Prussia at the same time, which produced a similar result.\n\n[[File:Otto Wels.jpg|thumb|left|200px|During the debate on the Enabling Act, Social Democrat chairman [[Otto Wels]] spoke the last free words in the Reichstag: ''\"You can take our lives and our freedom, but you cannot take our honour. We are defenseless but not honourless.\"'' The subsequent passage of the Act did away with parliamentary democracy.]]\n\nWhen the newly elected ''Reichstag'' first convened on 23 March 1933\u2014not including the Communist delegates because their party had been banned on 6 March &ndash; it passed the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] (''{{lang|de|Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz}}'').  This law gave the government &ndash; in practice, Hitler &ndash; the right to make laws without the involvement of the Reichstag.  For all intents and purposes, the entire [[Weimar Constitution]] was rendered void.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=351\u201355}} Soon afterwards the government banned the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]], which had voted against the Act.  By midsummer, the other parties had been intimidated into dissolving themselves rather than face arrests and [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] imprisonment and all non-Nazi ministers of the coalition government had been compelled to resign their posts.\n\nThe \"First ''{{lang|de|Gleichschaltung}}'' Law\" (''{{lang|de|Erstes Gleichschaltungsgesetz}}'', 31 March 1933), the first passed using the Enabling Act, dissolved the diets of all ''[[States of Germany|L\u00e4nder]]'' except the recently-elected [[Prussia]]n parliament, which the Nazis already controlled. The same law ordered the state diets reconstituted on the basis of the votes in the last Reichstag election (with the exception of Communist seats), and also gave the state governments the same powers the Reich government possessed under the Enabling Act.\n\n\"Second ''{{lang|de|Gleichschaltung}}'' Law\" (''{{lang|de|Zweites Gleichschaltungsgesetz}}'', 7 April 1933) deployed one ''{{lang|de|[[Reichsstatthalter]]}}'' (Reich Governor) in each state, apart from Prussia. These officers, responsible to [[Minister of the Interior (Germany)|Interior Minister]] [[Wilhelm Frick]], were supposed to act as local [[proconsul]]s in each state, with near-complete control over the state governments. For Prussia, which in any event constituted the bulk of Germany, Hitler reserved these rights for himself and delegated them to Prussian minister-president [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]].  This law effectively defederalized the Reich for the first time ever.\n\nThe \"[[Law for the Restoration of a Professional Civil Service]]\", decreed on 7 April, enabled the \"co-ordination\" of the civil service &ndash; which in Germany included not only bureaucrats, but also schoolteachers and professors, judges, prosecutors and other professionals &ndash;  at both the Federal and state level, and authorized the removal of Jews and Communists.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=382,437}}\n\nThe \"Law Against the Establishment of Political Parties\" (14 July 1933) declared the Nazi Party to be the country's only legal party. However, for all practical purposes Germany had been a one-party state since the passage of the Enabling Act.\n\nThe Nazis called [[German election, November 1933|parliamentary elections]] for November 12, 1933. Since the Nazi Party was the sole legal party in Germany, voters were presented with a single list containing Nazis and 22 pro-Nazi \"guests.\" Furthermore, to whip up nationalist sentiment in the run up to the vote, the Nazis intentionally timed the election to coincide with the fifteenth anniversary of the Armistice. Compelled to vote in far from secret circumstances, 92.1% the electorate voted in favour of the Nazi list, thereby formally replacing the Reichstag elected eight months earlier with a [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|rubberstamp legislature]]. A [[German referendum, 1933|referendum on German withdrawal from the League of Nations]] was held on the same day under the same circumstances, and passed with 95.1% support.\n\nThe \"Law Concerning the Reconstruction of the Reich\" (''{{lang|de|Gesetz \u00fcber den Neuaufbau des Reiches}}'') (30 January 1934) formally did away with the concept of a [[federal republic]], converting Germany into a highly centralized state.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746923,00.html Death of the States], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', February 12, 1934</ref> The states were reduced to mere provinces, as their institutions were practically abolished altogether.  All of their powers passed to the central government. A law passed on 14 February formally abolished the Reichsrat.\n\nThe \"Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich\"{{sfn|Overy|2004}} (1 August 1934) prescribed that upon the death of the incumbent president, that office would be merged with the office of the chancellor, and that the competencies of the former should be transferred to the ''\"{{lang|de|[[F\u00fchrer]] und Reichskanzler Adolf Hitler}}\"'', as the law stated. Hindenburg died at nine o'clock the next morning, making Hitler head of state as well as head of government.  Like the law abolishing the {{lang|de|Reichsrat}}, this law actually violated the Enabling Act, which specifically forbade Hitler from tampering with the presidency. Additionally, in 1932 the constitution had been amended to make the president of the High Court of Justice, not the chancellor, acting president pending new elections. However, no one raised any objections.  This law abolished the last remedy by which Hitler could be legally dismissed\u2014and with it the last check on his power. The changes were ratified by the electorate in [[German referendum, 1934|a referendum]] held on August 19 and conducted in a similar manner to the vote of November 1933 \u2013 albeit with a slightly reduced majority (88.1% in favour). From this point onward, Hitler can be described as the dictator of Germany until his suicide in 1945.\n\n==History==\nIn a speech in March 1933, chief Nazi [[propaganda|propagandist]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] said:\n\n<blockquote>[T]he secret of propaganda [is to] permeate the person it aims to grasp, without his even noticing that he is being permeated. ''Of course'' propaganda has a purpose, but the purpose must be concealed with such cleverness and virtuosity that the person on whom this purpose is to be carried out doesn't notice it at all.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=127}}</blockquote>\n\nThis was also the purpose of \"co-ordination\": to insure that every aspect of the lives of German citizens was permeated with the ideas and prejudices of the Nazis.  To this end, from March to July 1933 and continuing afterwards, the Nazi-controlled German government and the Nazi Party systematically eliminated or co-opted non-Nazi organizations that could potentially influence people. Those critical of Hitler and the Nazis were suppressed, intimidated or murdered.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=381-90}}\n\n<blockquote>Every national voluntary association, and every local club, was brought under Nazi control, from industrial and agricultural pressure groups to sports associations, football clubs, male voice choirs, women's organizations &ndash; in short, the whole fabric of associational life was Nazified. Rival, politically oriented clubs or societies were merged into a single Nazi body.  Existing leaders of voluntary associations were either unceremoniously ousted, or knuckled under of their own accord.  Many organizations expelled leftish or liberal members and declared their allegiance to the new state and its institutions.  The whole process ... went on all over Germany. ... By the end, virtually the only non-Nazi associations left were the army and the Churches with their lay organizations.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=14}}</blockquote>\n\nAn important part of the \"co-ordination\" effort was the purging of the civil service, both at the Federal and state level. Top Federal civil servants - the State Secretaries - were largely replaced if they weren't sympathetic to the Nazi program, as were the equivalent bureaucrats in the states, but Nazification took place at every level.  Civil servants rushed to join the Nazi Party, fearing that if they did not they would lose their jobs.  At the local level, mayors and councils were terrorized by Nazi stormtroopers of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] into resigning or following orders to replace officials and workers at local public institutions who were Jewish or belonged to other political parties.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=381-83}}\n\nThe ''{{lang|de|Gleichschaltung}}'' also included the formation of various organisations with compulsory membership for segments of the population, in particular the youth of Germany. Boys first served as apprentices in the ''{{lang|de|[[Pimpfen]]}}'' (cubs), beginning at the age of six, and at age ten, entered the ''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches Jungvolk]]}}'' (Young German Boys) and served there until entering the [[Hitler Youth]] proper at age fourteen. Boys remained there until age eighteen, at which time they entered into the ''[[Arbeitsdienst]]'' (Labor Service) and the [[Wehrmacht|armed forces]]. Girls became part of the ''{{lang|de|[[Jungm\u00e4del]]}}'' (Young Maidens) at age ten and at age fourteen were enrolled in the ''{{lang|de|[[Bund Deutscher M\u00e4del]]}}'' (League of German Maidens). At eighteen, [[League of German Girls|BDM]] members went generally to the eastern territory for their ''{{lang|de|Pflichtdienst}}'', or ''{{lang|de|Landjahr}}'', a year of labor on a farm. By 1940, membership in the Hitler Youth numbered some eight million.{{sfn|Stachura|1998|p=479}}\n\n===Strength Through Joy===\nAn all-embracing recreational organization for workers, called ''{{lang|de|[[Kraft durch Freude]]}}'' (\"Strength Through Joy\") was set up under the auspices of the [[German Labor Front]] (''{{lang-de|Deutsche Arbeitsfront}}'' or DAF), which had been created when the Nazis forcibly dissolved the trade unions on 2 May 1933, thus eviscerating the labor movement. Hobbies were regimented, and all private clubs, whether they be for chess, football, or woodworking, were brought under the control of Strength Through Joy, which also provided vacation trips &ndash; skiing, swimming, concerts and ocean cruises. With some 25 million members, Strength Through Joy was the largest of the many organizations established by the Nazis. Workers were also brought in line with the party, through activities such as the ''{{lang|de|[[Reichsberufswettkampf]]}}'', a national vocational competition.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Denazification]]\n*[[Enabling Act of 1933]]\n*[[Reichstag Fire Decree]]\n*[[Weimar Constitution]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2018}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n*{{cite book| last=Burleigh | first=Michael| authorlink=Michael Burleigh | title=The Third Reich: A New History |year = 2000 |location=New York | publisher= [[Hill and Wang]] | isbn=0-8090-9325-1| ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|title= [[The Coming of the Third Reich]] |last=Evans|first= Richard J.|authorlink=Richard J.

His grandfather [[Franz B\u00f6hm (musician)|Franz B\u00f6hm]] (1788\u20131846) (the violinist [[Joseph B\u00f6hm]]'s brother) was a well-known musician and soloist in a Russian imperial orchestra.<ref>[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_music/924/\u0411\u0451\u043c ru: The musical encyclopedia (\u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f)].</ref> Cantor's father had been a member of the [[Saint Petersburg Bourse|Saint Petersburg stock exchange]]; when he became ill, the family moved to Germany in 1856, first to [[Wiesbaden]], then to [[Frankfurt]], seeking milder  winters than those of Saint Petersburg. In 1860, Cantor graduated with distinction from the Realschule in [[Darmstadt]]; his exceptional skills in mathematics, [[trigonometry]] in particular, were noted.

They had six children, the last (Rudolph) born in 1886. Cantor was able to support a family despite modest academic pay, thanks to his inheritance from his father. During his honeymoon in the [[Harz|Harz mountains]], Cantor spent much time in mathematical discussions with [[Richard Dedekind]], whom he had met two years earlier while on Swiss holiday.\n\nCantor was promoted to extraordinary professor in 1872 and made full professor in 1879.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> To attain the latter rank at the age of 34 was a notable accomplishment, but Cantor desired a [[professor|chair]] at a more prestigious university, in particular at Berlin, at that time the leading German university. However, his work encountered too much opposition for that to be possible.<ref name=\"daub163\">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 163.</ref> Kronecker, who headed mathematics at Berlin until his death in 1891, became increasingly uncomfortable with the prospect of having Cantor as a colleague,<ref name=\"daub34\">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 34.</ref> perceiving him as a \"corrupter of youth\" for teaching his ideas to a younger generation of mathematicians.<ref>[[#Dauben1977|Dauben 1977]], p. 89 ''15n.''</ref> Worse yet, Kronecker, a well-established figure within the mathematical community and Cantor's former professor, disagreed fundamentally with the thrust of Cantor's work ever since he intentionally delayed the publication of Cantor's first major publication in 1874.<ref name=\":1\" /> Kronecker, now seen as one of the founders of the [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive viewpoint in mathematics]], disliked much of Cantor's set theory because it asserted the existence of sets satisfying certain properties, without giving specific examples of sets whose members did indeed satisfy those properties. Whenever Cantor applied for a post in Berlin, he was declined, and it usually involved Kronecker,<ref name=\":1\" /> so Cantor came to believe that Kronecker's stance would make it impossible for him ever to leave Halle.\n\nIn 1881, Cantor's Halle colleague [[Eduard Heine]] died, creating a vacant chair. Halle accepted Cantor's suggestion that it be offered to Dedekind, [[Heinrich M. Weber]] and [[Franz Mertens]], in that order, but each declined the chair after being offered it. Friedrich Wangerin was eventually appointed, but he was never close to Cantor.\n\nIn 1882, the mathematical correspondence between Cantor and Dedekind came to an end, apparently as a result of Dedekind's declining the chair at Halle.<ref>[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 2\u20133; [[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]], pp. 354\u2013355.</ref> Cantor also began another important correspondence, with [[G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler]] in Sweden, and soon began to publish in Mittag-Leffler's journal ''Acta Mathematica''. But in 1885, Mittag-Leffler was concerned about the philosophical nature and new terminology in a paper Cantor had submitted to ''Acta''.<ref name=\"daub138\">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 138.</ref> He asked Cantor to withdraw the paper from ''Acta'' while it was in proof, writing that it was \"...&nbsp;about one hundred years too soon.\" Cantor complied, but then curtailed his relationship and correspondence with Mittag-Leffler, writing to a third party, \"Had Mittag-Leffler had his way, I should have to wait until the year 1984, which to me seemed too great a demand! ... But of course I never want to know anything again about ''Acta Mathematica''.\"<ref name=\"daub139\">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 139.</ref>\n\nCantor suffered his first known bout of depression on May 1884.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name = \"daub282\"/> Criticism of his work weighed on his mind: every one of the fifty-two letters he wrote to Mittag-Leffler in 1884 mentioned Kronecker. A passage from one of these letters is revealing of the damage to Cantor's self-confidence:\n\n{{quote|... I don't know when I shall return to the continuation of my scientific work.

He also began an intense study of [[Elizabethan literature]] thinking there might be evidence that [[Francis Bacon]] wrote the plays attributed to [[William Shakespeare]] (see [[Shakespearean authorship question]]); this ultimately resulted in two pamphlets, published in 1896 and 1897.<ref>[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 281\u2013283.</ref>\n\nCantor recovered soon thereafter, and subsequently made further important contributions, including his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]] and [[Cantor's theorem|theorem]]. However, he never again attained the high level of his remarkable papers of 1874\u201384, even after Kronecker's death on December 29, 1891.<ref name=\":1\" /> He eventually sought, and achieved, a reconciliation with Kronecker. Nevertheless, the philosophical disagreements and difficulties dividing them persisted.\n\nIn 1889, Cantor was instrumental in founding the [[German Mathematical Society]]<ref name=\":1\" /> and chaired its first meeting in Halle in 1891, where he first introduced his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]]; his reputation was strong enough, despite Kronecker's opposition to his work, to ensure he was elected as the first president of this society. Setting aside the animosity Kronecker had displayed towards him, Cantor invited him to address the meeting, but Kronecker was unable to do so because his wife was dying from injuries sustained in a skiing accident at the time. Georg Cantor was also instrumental in the establishment of the first [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], which was held in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, in 1897.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n===Later years and death===\nAfter Cantor's 1884 hospitalization, there is no record that he was in any [[sanatorium]] again until 1899.<ref name=\"daub282\">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 282.</ref> Soon after that second hospitalization, Cantor's youngest son Rudolph died suddenly on December 16 (Cantor was delivering a lecture on his views on [[Baconian theory]] and [[William Shakespeare]]), and this tragedy drained Cantor of much of his passion for mathematics.<ref name=\"daub283\">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 283.</ref> Cantor was again hospitalized in 1903. One year later, he was outraged and agitated by a paper presented by [[Julius K\u00f6nig]] at the Third [[International Congress of Mathematicians]]. The paper attempted to prove that the basic tenets of transfinite set theory were false.  Since the paper had been read in front of his daughters and colleagues, Cantor perceived himself as having been publicly humiliated.<ref>For a discussion of K\u00f6nig's paper see [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 248\u2013250. For Cantor's reaction, see [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 248, 283.</ref> Although [[Ernst Zermelo]] demonstrated less than a day later that K\u00f6nig's proof had failed, Cantor remained shaken, and momentarily questioning God.<ref name=\"daub248\">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 248.</ref> Cantor suffered from chronic depression for the rest of his life, for which he was excused from teaching on several occasions and repeatedly confined in various sanatoria. The events of 1904 preceded a series of hospitalizations at intervals of two or three years.<ref>[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 283\u2013284.</ref> He did not abandon mathematics completely, however, lecturing on the paradoxes of set theory ([[Burali-Forti paradox]], [[Cantor's paradox]], and [[Russell's paradox]]) to a meeting of the ''Deutsche Mathematiker\u2013Vereinigung'' in 1903, and attending the International Congress of Mathematicians at [[Heidelberg]] in 1904.\n\nIn 1911, Cantor was one of the distinguished foreign scholars invited to attend the 500th anniversary of the founding of the [[University of St. Andrews]] in Scotland. Cantor attended, hoping to meet [[Bertrand Russell]], whose newly published ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' repeatedly cited Cantor's work, but this did not come about. The following year, St. Andrews awarded Cantor an honorary doctorate, but illness precluded his receiving the degree in person.\n\nCantor retired in 1913, living in poverty and suffering from [[Malnutrition|malnourishment]] during [[World War I]].<ref name=\"daub284\">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 284.</ref> The public celebration of his 70th birthday was canceled because of the war. In June 1917, he entered a sanatorium for the last time and continually wrote to his wife asking to be allowed to go home. Georg Cantor had a fatal heart attack on January 6, 1918, in the sanatorium where he had spent the last year of his life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Mathematical work==\nCantor's work between 1874 and 1884 is the origin of [[set theory]].<ref name=\"Johnson p. 55\">{{Citation |surname=Johnson|given= Phillip E.|year=1972|title=The Genesis and Development of Set Theory|journal=The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal|jstor=3026799|volume=3|issue=1|page=55|doi=10.2307/3026799}}</ref> Prior to this work, the concept of a set was a rather elementary one that had been used implicitly since the beginning of mathematics, dating back to the ideas of [[Aristotle]]. No one had realized that set theory had any nontrivial content. Before Cantor, there were only finite sets (which are easy to understand) and \"the infinite\" (which was considered a topic for philosophical, rather than mathematical, discussion). By proving that there are (infinitely) many possible sizes for infinite sets, Cantor established that set theory was not trivial, and it needed to be studied. [[Axiomatic set theory|Set theory]] has come to play the role of a [[foundations of mathematics|foundational theory]] in modern mathematics, in the sense that it interprets propositions about mathematical objects (for example, numbers and functions) from all the traditional areas of mathematics (such as [[algebra]], [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[topology]]) in a single theory, and provides a standard set of axioms to prove or disprove them. The basic concepts of set theory are now used throughout mathematics.<ref>{{citation|title=Axiomatic Set Theory|first=Patrick|last=Suppes|authorlink=Patrick Suppes|year=1972|publisher=Dover|isbn=9780486616308|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sxr4LrgJGeAC&pg=PA1|quote=With a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects.  ... As a consequence, many fundamental questions about the nature of mathematics may be reduced to questions about set theory.}}</ref>\n\nIn one of his earliest papers,<ref>{{Harvnb|Cantor|1874}}</ref> Cantor proved that the set of [[real number]]s is \"more numerous\" than the set of [[natural number]]s; this showed, for the first time, that there exist infinite sets of different [[Cardinality|sizes]]. He was also the first to appreciate the importance of [[one-to-one correspondence]]s (hereinafter denoted \"1-to-1 correspondence\") in set theory. He used this concept to define [[finite set|finite]] and [[infinite set]]s, subdividing the latter into [[countable set|denumerable]] (or countably infinite) sets and [[uncountable set|nondenumerable set]]s (uncountably infinite sets).<ref>A [[countable set]] is a set which is either finite or denumerable; the denumerable sets are therefore the infinite countable sets. However, this terminology is not universally followed, and sometimes \"denumerable\" is used as a synonym for \"countable\".</ref>\n\nCantor developed important concepts in [[topology]] and their relation to [[cardinality]]. For example, he showed that the [[Cantor set]] is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]], but has the same cardinality as the set of all real numbers, whereas the [[Rational number|rationals]] are everywhere dense, but countable. He also showed that all countable dense [[total order|linear orders]] without end points are order-isomorphic to the [[rational numbers]].\n\nCantor introduced fundamental constructions in set theory, such as the [[power set]] of a set ''A'', which is the set of all possible [[subset]]s of ''A''. He later proved that the size of the power set of ''A'' is strictly larger than the size of ''A'', even when ''A'' is an infinite set; this result soon became known as [[Cantor's theorem]]. Cantor developed an entire theory and [[Ordinal arithmetic|arithmetic of infinite sets]], called [[Cardinal number|cardinals]] and [[Ordinal number|ordinals]], which extended the arithmetic of the natural numbers. His notation for the cardinal numbers was the Hebrew letter <math>\\aleph</math> ([[aleph number|aleph]]) with a natural number subscript; for the ordinals he employed the Greek letter \u03c9 ([[omega]]). This notation is still in use today.\n\nThe ''[[Continuum hypothesis]]'', introduced by Cantor, was presented by [[David Hilbert]] as the first of his [[Hilbert's problems|twenty-three open problems]] in his address at the 1900 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Paris. Cantor's work also attracted favorable notice beyond Hilbert's celebrated encomium.<ref name=\"encomium\">{{Citation |surname=Reid|given= Constance|year=1996|title=Hilbert|place=New York|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0-387-04999-1|page=\n177}}</ref> The US philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] praised Cantor's set theory and, following public lectures delivered by Cantor at the first International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Zurich in 1897, [[Adolf Hurwitz]] and [[Jacques Hadamard]] also both expressed their admiration. At that Congress, Cantor renewed his friendship and correspondence with Dedekind. From 1905, Cantor corresponded with his British admirer and translator [[Philip Jourdain]] on the history of [[set theory]] and on Cantor's religious ideas. This was later published, as were several of his expository works.\n\n===Number theory, trigonometric series and ordinals===\nCantor's first ten papers were on [[number theory]], his thesis topic. At the suggestion of [[Eduard Heine]], the Professor at Halle, Cantor turned to [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Heine proposed that Cantor solve [[Open problem|an open problem]] that had eluded [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]], [[Rudolf Lipschitz]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and Heine himself: the uniqueness of the representation of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] by [[trigonometric series]]. Cantor solved this difficult problem in 1869. It was while working on this problem that he discovered transfinite ordinals, which occurred as indices ''n'' in the ''n''th [[derived set (mathematics)|derived set]] ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> of a set ''S'' of zeros of a trigonometric series. Given a trigonometric series f(x) with ''S'' as its set of zeros, Cantor had discovered a procedure that produced another trigonometric series that had ''S''<sub>1</sub> as its set of zeros, where ''S''<sub>1</sub> is the set of [[limit point]]s of ''S''. If ''S''<sub>''k+1''</sub> is the set of limit points of ''S''<sub>''k''</sub>, then he could construct a trigonometric series whose zeros are ''S''<sub>''k+1''</sub>. Because the sets ''S''<sub>''k''</sub> were closed, they contained their [[Limit point]]s, and the intersection of the infinite decreasing sequence of sets ''S'', ''S''<sub>1</sub>, ''S''<sub>2</sub>, ''S''<sub>3</sub>,... formed a limit set, which we would now call ''S''<sub>''\u03c9''</sub>, and then he noticed that ''S''<sub>\u03c9</sub> would also have to have a set of limit points ''S''<sub>\u03c9+1</sub>, and so on. He had examples that went on forever, and so here was a naturally occurring infinite sequence of infinite numbers ''\u03c9'', ''\u03c9''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, ''\u03c9''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2, ...<ref>{{Citation|last1=Cooke|first1=Roger|title=Uniqueness of trigonometric series and descriptive set theory, 1870\u20131985|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|volume=45|page=281|year=1993|doi=10.1007/BF01886630|issue=4|postscript=.}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1870 and 1872, Cantor published more papers on trigonometric series, and also a paper defining [[irrational number]]s as [[Sequence space|convergent sequences]] of [[rational number]]s.

Call this set ''T''<sub>0</sub>. Then ''T''&nbsp;= ''T''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;{''t<sub>n</sub>''}&nbsp;= ''T''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;{''t''<sub>2''n''-1</sub>}&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;{''t''<sub>2''n''</sub>}.

So both ''T'' and '''R''' are the union of three [[pairwise disjoint]] sets: ''T''<sub>0</sub> and two countable sets. A one-to-one correspondence between ''T'' and '''R''' is given by the function: ''f''(''t'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''t'' if ''t''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''T''<sub>0</sub>, ''f''(''t''<sub>2''n''-1</sub>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;''t<sub>n</sub>'', and ''f''(''t''<sub>2''n''</sub>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''. Cantor actually applies his construction to the irrationals rather than the transcendentals, but he knew that it applies to any set formed by removing countably many numbers from the set of reals ({{harvnb|Cantor|1879|p=4}}).</ref>\n\nBetween 1879 and 1884, Cantor published a series of six articles in ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'' that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Leopold Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only if they could be constructed in a [[finitism|finite]] number of steps from the natural numbers, which he took as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of [[actual infinity]] would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole.<ref name=\"popeleo\">[[#Dauben1977|Dauben 1977]], p. 89.</ref> Cantor also introduced the [[Cantor set]] during this period.\n\nThe fifth paper in this series, \"'''''Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre\"''''' (\"''Foundations of a General Theory of Aggregates\"''), published in 1883,<ref>{{harvnb|Cantor|1883}}.</ref> was the most important of the six and was also published as a separate [[monograph]]. It contained Cantor's reply to his critics and showed how the [[transfinite number]]s were a systematic extension of the natural numbers. It begins by defining [[well-order]]ed sets. [[Ordinal number]]s are then introduced as the order types of well-ordered sets. Cantor then defines the addition and multiplication of the [[cardinal number|cardinal]] and ordinal numbers. In 1885, Cantor extended his theory of order types so that the ordinal numbers simply became a special case of order types.\n\nIn 1891, he published a paper containing his elegant \"diagonal argument\" for the existence of an uncountable set. He applied the same idea to prove [[Cantor's theorem]]: the [[cardinality]] of the power set of a set ''A'' is strictly larger than the cardinality of ''A''. This established the richness of the hierarchy of infinite sets, and of the [[cardinal arithmetic|cardinal]] and [[ordinal arithmetic]] that Cantor had defined. His argument is fundamental in the solution of the [[Halting problem]] and the proof of [[G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem]]. Cantor wrote on the [[Goldbach conjecture]] in 1894.\n\n[[File:Passage with the set definition of Georg Cantor.png|thumb|Passage of Georg Cantor's article with his set definition]]\nIn 1895 and 1897, Cantor published a two-part paper in ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'' under [[Felix Klein]]'s editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cantor|1895}}, {{harvtxt|Cantor|1897}}. The English translation is [[#Cantor1955|Cantor 1955]].</ref> The first paper begins by defining set, [[subset]], etc., in ways that would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis, but had to settle for expositing his theory of [[well-ordered set]]s and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if ''A'' and ''B'' are sets with ''A'' [[equinumerous|equivalent]] to a subset of ''B'' and ''B'' equivalent to a subset of ''A'', then ''A'' and ''B'' are equivalent. [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]] had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. [[Felix Bernstein (mathematician)|Felix Bernstein]] supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name [[Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schr\u00f6der theorem]].\n\n====One-to-one correspondence====\n{{Main|Bijection}}\n[[File:Bijection.svg|thumb|A bijective function]]\nCantor's 1874 [[Crelle's Journal|Crelle]] paper was the first to invoke the notion of a [[Bijection|1-to-1]] correspondence, though he did not use that phrase. He then began looking for a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points of the [[unit square]] and the points of a unit [[line segment]]. In an 1877 letter to Richard Dedekind, Cantor proved a far [[Mathematical jargon#stronger|stronger]] result: for any positive integer ''n'', there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points on the unit line segment and all of the points in an [[n-dimensional space|''n''-dimensional space]]. About this discovery Cantor wrote to Dedekind: \"{{lang|fr|Je le vois, mais je ne le crois pas!}}\" (\"I see it, but I don't believe it!\")<ref>{{Citation |surname=Wallace|given= David Foster|year=2003|title=Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity|place=New York|publisher=W.&nbsp;W. Norton and Company|isbn=0-393-00338-8|page=259}}</ref> The result that he found so astonishing has implications for geometry and the notion of [[dimension]].\n\nIn 1878, Cantor submitted another paper to Crelle's Journal, in which he defined precisely the concept of a 1-to-1 correspondence and introduced the notion of \"[[cardinality|power]]\" (a term he took from [[Jakob Steiner]]) or \"equivalence\" of sets: two sets are equivalent (have the same power) if there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between them. Cantor defined [[countable set]]s (or denumerable sets) as sets which can be put into a 1-to-1 correspondence with the [[natural number]]s, and proved that the rational numbers are denumerable. He also proved that ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> has the same power as the [[real number]]s '''R''', as does a countably infinite [[Cartesian product|product]] of copies of '''R'''. While he made free use of countability as a concept, he did not write the word \"countable\" until 1883. Cantor also discussed his thinking about [[dimension]], stressing that his [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] between the [[unit interval]] and the unit square was not a [[continuous function|continuous]] one.\n\nThis paper displeased Kronecker and Cantor wanted to withdraw it; however, Dedekind persuaded him not to do so and [[Karl Weierstrass]] supported its publication.<ref>[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 69, 324 ''63n''. The paper had been submitted in July 1877. Dedekind supported it, but delayed its publication due to Kronecker's opposition. Weierstrass actively supported it.</ref> Nevertheless, Cantor never again submitted anything to Crelle.\n\n====Continuum hypothesis====\n{{Main|Continuum hypothesis}}\nCantor was the first to formulate what later came to be known as the [[continuum hypothesis]] or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is ''exactly'' aleph-one, rather than just ''at least'' aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to [[mathematical proof|prove]] it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.<ref name=\"daub280\" />\n\nThe difficulty Cantor had in proving the continuum hypothesis has been underscored by later developments in the field of mathematics: a 1940 result by [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] and a 1963 one by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] together imply that the continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved using standard [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] plus the [[axiom of choice]] (the combination referred to as \"ZFC\").<ref>Some mathematicians consider these results to have settled the issue, and, at most, allow that it is possible to examine the formal consequences of CH or of its negation, or of axioms that imply one of those. Others continue to look for \"natural\" or \"plausible\" axioms that, when added to ZFC, will permit either a proof or refutation of CH, or even for direct evidence for or against CH itself; among the most prominent of these is [[W. Hugh Woodin]]. One of G\u00f6del's last papers argues that the CH is false, and the continuum has cardinality Aleph-2.</ref>\n\n====Absolute infinite, well-ordering theorem, and paradoxes====\nIn 1883, Cantor divided the infinite into the transfinite and the [[Absolute Infinite|absolute]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cantor|1883|pp=587\u2013588}}; English translation: [[#Ewald|Ewald 1996]], pp. 916&ndash;917.</ref> The transfinite is increasable in magnitude, while the absolute is unincreasable. For example, an ordinal \u03b1 is transfinite because it can be increased to \u03b1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. On the other hand, the ordinals form an absolutely infinite sequence that cannot be increased in magnitude because there are no larger ordinals to add to it.<ref>[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], pp. 41&ndash;42.</ref> In 1883, Cantor also introduced the well-ordering principle \"every set can be well-ordered\" and stated that it is a \"law of thought.\"<ref>[[#Moore1982|Moore 1982]], p. 42.</ref>\n\nCantor extended his work on the absolute infinite by using it in a proof. Around 1895, he began to regard his well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted to prove it. In 1899, he sent Dedekind a proof of the equivalent aleph theorem: the cardinality of every infinite set is an [[aleph number|aleph]].<ref>[[#Moore1982|Moore 1982]], p. 51. Proof of equivalence: If a set is well-ordered, then its cardinality is an aleph since the alephs are the cardinals of well-ordered sets. If a set's cardinality is an aleph, then it can be well-ordered since there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the well-ordered set defining the aleph.</ref> First, he defined two types of multiplicities: consistent multiplicities (sets) and inconsistent multiplicities (absolutely infinite multiplicities). Next he assumed that the ordinals form a set, proved that this leads to a contradiction, and concluded that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. He used this inconsistent multiplicity to prove the aleph theorem.<ref>[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], pp. 166&ndash;169.</ref> In 1932, Zermelo criticized the construction in Cantor's proof.<ref>Cantor's proof, which is a [[proof by contradiction]], starts by assuming there is a set ''S'' whose cardinality is not an aleph. A function from the ordinals to ''S'' is constructed by successively choosing different elements of ''S'' for each ordinal. If this construction runs out of elements, then the function well-orders the set ''S''. This implies that the cardinality of ''S'' is an aleph, contradicting the assumption about ''S''. Therefore, the function maps all the ordinals one-to-one into ''S''. The function's [[Image (mathematics)|image]] is an inconsistent submultiplicity contained in ''S'', so the set ''S'' is an inconsistent multiplicity, which is a contradiction. Zermelo criticized Cantor's construction: \"the intuition of time is applied here to a process that goes beyond all intuition, and a fictitious entity is posited of which it is assumed that it could make ''successive'' arbitrary choices.\" ([[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], pp. 169&ndash;170.)</ref>\n\nCantor avoided [[paradox]]es by recognizing that there are two types of multiplicities. In his set theory, when it is assumed that the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. On the other hand, [[Bertrand Russell]] treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's set theory, the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is [[inconsistent]]. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] (which was just mentioned), [[Cantor's paradox]], and [[Russell's paradox]].<ref>[[#Moore1988|Moore 1988]], pp. 52&ndash;53; [[#Moore1981|Moore and Garciadiego 1981]], pp. 330&ndash;331.</ref> Russell named paradoxes after [[Cesare Burali-Forti]] and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.<ref>[[#Moore1981|Moore and Garciadiego 1981]], pp. 331, 343; [[#Purkert1989|Purkert 1989]], p. 56.</ref>\n\nIn 1908, Zermelo published [[Zermelo set theory|his axiom system for set theory]]. He had two motivations for developing the axiom system: eliminating the paradoxes and securing his proof of the [[well-ordering theorem]].<ref>[[#Moore1982|Moore 1982]], pp. 158&ndash;160. Moore argues that the latter was his primary motivation.</ref> Zermelo had proved this theorem in 1904 using the [[axiom of choice]], but his proof was criticized for a variety of reasons.<ref>Moore devotes a chapter to this criticism: \"Zermelo and His Critics (1904&ndash;1908)\", [[#Moore1982|Moore 1982]], pp. 85&ndash;141.</ref> His response to the criticism included his axiom system and a new proof of the well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.<ref>[[#Moore1982|Moore 1982]], pp. 158&ndash;160. [[#Zermelo1908|Zermelo 1908]], pp. 263&ndash;264; English translation: [[#Heijenoort|van Heijenoort 1967]], p. 202.</ref>\n\nIn 1923, [[John von Neumann]] developed an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes by using an approach similar to Cantor's\u2014namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a [[Class (set theory)|class]] is too big to be a set if it can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class.<ref>[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], pp. 288, 290&ndash;291. Cantor had pointed out that inconsistent multiplicities face the same restriction: they cannot be members of any multiplicity. ([[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], p. 286.)</ref> Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem.<ref>[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], pp. 291&ndash;292.</ref> In 1930, Zermelo defined [[Zermelo's models and the axiom of limitation of size|models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom]].<ref>[[#Zermelo1930|Zermelo 1930]]; English translation: [[#Ewald|Ewald 1996]], pp. 1208&ndash;1233.</ref>\n\n==Philosophy, religion and Cantor's mathematics==\nThe concept of the existence of an [[actual infinity]] was an important shared concern within the realms of mathematics, philosophy and religion. Preserving the [[orthodoxy]] of the relationship between God and mathematics, although not in the same form as held by his critics, was long a concern of Cantor's.<ref name=\"daub295\">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 295.</ref> He directly addressed this intersection between these disciplines in the introduction to his ''Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre,'' where he stressed the connection between his view of the infinite and the philosophical one.<ref>[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 120.</ref> To Cantor, his mathematical views were intrinsically linked to their philosophical and theological implications&nbsp;\u2013 he identified the [[Absolute Infinite]] with God,<ref>[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986]], p. 13. Compare to the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]].</ref> and he considered his work on transfinite numbers to have been directly communicated to him by God, who had chosen Cantor to reveal them to the world.<ref name = \"xdpfir\"/>\n\nDebate among mathematicians grew out of opposing views in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] regarding the nature of actual infinity. Some held to the view that infinity was an abstraction which was not mathematically legitimate, and denied its existence.<ref name=\"daub225\">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 225</ref> Mathematicians from three major schools of thought ([[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] and its two offshoots, [[intuitionism]] and [[finitism]]) opposed Cantor's theories in this matter. For constructivists such as Kronecker, this rejection of actual infinity stems from fundamental disagreement with the idea that [[nonconstructive proof]]s such as Cantor's diagonal argument are sufficient proof that something exists, holding instead that [[constructive proof]]s are required. Intuitionism also rejects the idea that actual infinity is an expression of any sort of reality, but arrive at the decision via a different route than constructivism. Firstly, Cantor's argument rests on logic to prove the existence of transfinite numbers as an actual mathematical entity, whereas intuitionists hold that mathematical entities cannot be reduced to logical propositions, originating instead in the intuitions of the mind.<ref name=\"daub266\"/> Secondly, the notion of infinity as an expression of reality is itself disallowed in intuitionism, since the human mind cannot intuitively construct an infinite set.<ref>{{Citation |surname=Snapper|given=Ernst |year=1979|url=<!-- http://math.boisestate.edu/~tconklin/MATH547/Main/Exhibits/Three%20Crises%20in%20Math%20A.pdf -->http://www2.gsu.edu/~matgtc/three%20crises%20in%20mathematics.pdf |title=The Three Crises in Mathematics: Logicism, Intuitionism and Formalism|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=524|pages=207\u2013216}}</ref> Mathematicians such as [[L.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;J.

The only restrictions on this [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] system are that all mathematical concepts must be devoid of internal contradiction, and that they follow from existing definitions, axioms, and theorems. This belief is summarized in his assertion that \"the essence of mathematics is its freedom.\"<ref>[[#Dauben1977|Dauben 1977]], pp. 91\u201393.</ref> These ideas parallel those of [[Edmund Husserl]], whom Cantor had met in Halle.<ref>On Cantor, Husserl, and [[Gottlob Frege]], see Hill and Rosado Haddock (2000).</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Cantor himself was fiercely opposed to infinitesimals, describing them as both an \"abomination\" and \"the cholera bacillus of mathematics\".<ref name=\"Infinitesimal\" />\n\nCantor's 1883 paper reveals that he was well aware of the [[Controversy over Cantor's theory|opposition]] his ideas were encountering: \"... I realize that in this undertaking I place myself in a certain opposition to views widely held concerning the mathematical infinite and to opinions frequently defended on the nature of numbers.\"<ref name=\"daub96\">\"[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 96.</ref>\n\nHence he devotes much space to justifying his earlier work, asserting that mathematical concepts may be freely introduced as long as they are free of [[contradiction]] and defined in terms of previously accepted concepts. He also cites Aristotle, [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], [[George Berkeley]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Bernard Bolzano]] on infinity.\n\n==Cantor's ancestry==\n[[File:Blackboard Georg Cantor (11-line V O building 24).jpg|thumb|The title on the memorial plaque (in Russian): \"In this building was born and lived from 1845 till 1854 the great mathematician and creator of set theory Georg Cantor\", [[Vasilievsky Island]], Saint-Petersburg.]]\nCantor's paternal grandparents were from [[Copenhagen]] and fled to Russia from the disruption of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. There is very little direct information on his grandparents.<ref>''E.g.'', Grattan-Guinness's only evidence on the grandfather's date of death is that he signed papers at his son's engagement.</ref>\nCantor was sometimes called Jewish in his lifetime,<ref>For example, [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], art. \"Cantor, Georg\"; [[Jewish Year Book]] 1896\u201397, \"List of Jewish Celebrities of the Nineteenth Century\", p. 119; this list has a star against people with one Jewish parent, but Cantor is not starred.</ref> but has also variously been called Russian, German, and Danish as well.\n\nJakob Cantor, Cantor's grandfather, gave his children Christian [[saint]]s' names. Further, several of his grandmother's relatives were in the Czarist civil service, which would not welcome Jews, unless they [[Religious conversion|converted]] to Christianity. Cantor's father, Georg Waldemar Cantor, was educated in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] mission in Saint Petersburg, and his correspondence with his son shows both of them as devout Lutherans. Very little is known for sure about George Woldemar's origin or education.<ref name=\"pi87\">[[#Purkert|Purkert and Ilgauds 1985]], p. 15.</ref> His mother, Maria Anna B\u00f6hm, was an [[Austro-Hungarian]] born in Saint Petersburg and baptized [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]; she converted to [[Protestantism]] upon marriage. However, there is a letter from Cantor's brother Louis to their mother, stating:\n{{quote|M\u00f6gen wir zehnmal von Juden abstammen und ich im Princip noch so sehr f\u00fcr Gleichberechtigung der Hebr\u00e4er sein, im socialen Leben sind mir Christen lieber ...<ref name=\"pi87\"/>}}\n\n(\"Even if we were descended from Jews ten times over, and even though I may be, in principle, completely in favour of equal rights for Hebrews, in social life I prefer Christians...\") which could be read to imply that she was of Jewish ancestry.<ref>For more information, see: [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 1 and notes; [[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]], pp. 350\u2013352 and notes; [[#Purkert|Purkert and Ilgauds 1985]]; the letter is from {{harvnb|Aczel|2000|pp=93\u201394}}, from Louis' trip to Chicago in 1863. It is ambiguous in German, as in English, whether the recipient is included.</ref>\n\nThere were documented statements, during the 1930s, that called this Jewish ancestry into question:\n{{quote|More often [i.e., than the ancestry of the mother] the question has been discussed of whether Georg Cantor was of Jewish origin. About this it is reported in a notice of the Danish genealogical Institute in Copenhagen from the year 1937 concerning his father: \"It is hereby testified that Georg Woldemar Cantor, born 1809 or 1814, is not present in the registers of the Jewish community, and that he completely without doubt was not a Jew&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"pi87\"/>}}\n\nIt is also later said in the same document:\n{{quote|Also efforts for a long time by the librarian Josef Fischer, one of the best experts on Jewish genealogy in Denmark, charged with identifying Jewish professors, that Georg Cantor was of Jewish descent, finished without result. [Something seems to be wrong with this sentence, but the meaning seems clear enough.] In Cantor's published works and also in his [[Nachlass]] there are no statements by himself which relate to a Jewish origin of his ancestors. There is to be sure in the Nachlass a copy of a letter of his brother Ludwig from 18 November 1869 to their mother with some unpleasant antisemitic statements, in which it is said among other things:&nbsp;...<ref name=\"pi87\"/>}}(the rest of the quote is finished by the very first quote above). In Men of Mathematics, Eric Temple Bell described Cantor as being \"of pure Jewish descent on both sides,\" although both parents were baptized.  In a 1971 article entitled \"Towards a Biography of Georg Cantor,\" the British historian of mathematics Ivor Grattan-Guinness mentions ([[Annals of Science]] 27, pp.&nbsp;345\u2013391, 1971) that he was unable to find evidence of Jewish ancestry. (He also states that Cantor's wife, Vally Guttmann, was Jewish).\n\nIn a letter written by Georg Cantor to [[Paul Tannery]] in 1896 (Paul Tannery, Memoires Scientifique 13 Correspondence, Gauthier-Villars, Paris, 1934, p.&nbsp;306), Cantor states that his paternal grandparents were members of the Sephardic Jewish community of Copenhagen.  Specifically, Cantor states in describing his father: \"Er ist aber in Kopenhagen geboren, von israelitischen Eltern, die der dortigen portugisischen Judengemeinde...\"  (\"He was born in Copenhagen of Jewish (lit: \"Israelite\") parents from the local Portuguese-Jewish community.\")<ref>Tannery, Paul (1934) ''Memoires Scientifique 13 Correspondance'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, p. 306.</ref>\n\nIn addition, Cantor's maternal great uncle,<ref>[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 274.</ref> a Hungarian violinist [[Josef B\u00f6hm]], has been described as Jewish,<ref>Mendelsohn, Ezra (ed.) (1993) [http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11440061?versionId=13425381 ''Modern Jews and their musical agendas''], Oxford University Press, p. 9.</ref> which may imply that Cantor's mother was at least partly descended from the Hungarian Jewish community.<ref>''Ismerj\u00fck''oket?: zsid\u00f3 sz\u00e1rmaz\u00e1s\u00fa nevezetes magyarok arck\u00e9pcsarnoka'', Istv\u00e1n Rem\u00e9nyi Gyenes Ex Libris, (Budapest 1997), pages 132\u2013133</ref>\n\nIn a letter to Bertrand Russell, Cantor described his ancestry and self-perception as follows:\n{{quote|Neither my father nor my mother were of German blood, the first being a Dane, borne in Kopenhagen, my mother of Austrian Hungar descension. You must know, Sir, that I am not a ''regular just Germain'', for I am born 3 March 1845 at Saint Peterborough, Capital of Russia, but I went with my father and mother and brothers and sister, eleven years old in the year 1856, into Germany.<ref>Russell, Bertrand. ''Autobiography'', vol. I, p. 229. In English in the original; italics also as in the original.</ref>}}\n\n==Historiography==\nUntil the 1970s, the chief academic publications on Cantor were two short monographs by [[Arthur Moritz Sch\u00f6nflies]] (1927)&nbsp;\u2013 largely the correspondence with Mittag-Leffler&nbsp;\u2013 and Fraenkel (1930). Both were at second and third hand; neither had much on his personal life. The gap was largely filled by [[Eric Temple Bell]]'s ''[[Men of Mathematics]]'' (1937), which one of Cantor's modern biographers describes as \"perhaps the most widely read modern book on the [[history of mathematics]]\"; and as \"one of the worst\".<ref>[[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]], p. 350.</ref> Bell presents Cantor's relationship with his father as [[Oedipal]], Cantor's differences with Kronecker as a quarrel between two Jews, and Cantor's madness as Romantic despair over his failure to win acceptance for his mathematics. Grattan-Guinness (1971) found that none of these claims were true, but they may be found in many books of the intervening period, owing to the absence of any other narrative. There are other legends, independent of Bell&nbsp;\u2013 including one that labels Cantor's father a foundling, shipped to Saint Petersburg by unknown parents.<ref>[[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]] (quotation from p. 350, note), [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 1 and notes. (Bell's Jewish stereotypes appear to have been removed from some postwar editions.)</ref> A critique of Bell's book is contained in [[Joseph Dauben]]'s biography.<ref>[[#Dauben79|Dauben 1979]]</ref> Writes Dauben:\n{{quote|Cantor devoted some of his most vituperative correspondence, as well as a portion of the ''Beitr\u00e4ge'', to attacking what he described at one point as the '[[infinitesimal]] Cholera bacillus of mathematics', which had spread from Germany through the work of [[Carl Johannes Thomae|Thomae]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond|du Bois Reymond]] and [[Otto Stolz|Stolz]], to infect Italian mathematics ... Any acceptance of infinitesimals necessarily meant that his own theory of number was incomplete. Thus to accept the work of Thomae, du Bois-Reymond, Stolz and [[Giuseppe Veronese|Veronese]] was to deny the perfection of Cantor's own creation. Understandably, Cantor launched a thorough campaign to discredit Veronese's work in every way possible.<ref>Dauben, J.: The development of the Cantorian set theory, pp.~181\u2013219.

There is an error in this analysis. It states Cantor's Theorem 1 correctly: Algebraic numbers can be counted. However, it states his Theorem 2 incorrectly: Real numbers cannot be counted. It then says: \"Cantor notes that, taken together, Theorems 1 and 2 allow for the redemonstration of the existence of non-algebraic real numbers \u2026\" This existence demonstration is [[non-constructive]]. Theorem 2 stated correctly is: Given a sequence of real numbers, one can determine a real number that is not in the sequence. Taken together, Theorem 1 and this Theorem 2 produce a non-algebraic number. Cantor also used Theorem 2 to prove that the real numbers cannot be counted.

Its eight faculties offer training in the Creative Arts, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, Humanities, Education, Information Technology, Business, Economics and Law, and Health Sciences.\n\nThe University of Gothenburg has the highest number of applicants per study place in many of its subjects and courses, making it one of the most popular universities in Sweden.\n\n== History ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer    = \n| image1    = Gbg Kurs o tidningsbiblioteket front.jpg\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Library of social sciences, formerly main library\n| image2    = Gbg Kurs o tidningsbiblioteket reading room.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Library of social sciences, silent reading hall\n  }}\nThe University of Gothenburg was founded as ''G\u00f6teborgs h\u00f6gskola'' (Gothenburg University College) in 1891. In 1907 it was granted the same status as [[Uppsala University]] and [[Lund University]] by the Swedish government, thus creating Sweden's third university.\n\nOver the course of time, it has merged with a number of previously independent higher education institutions in the city and has continuously expanded its study profile. It was granted the rights of a full university by the Swedish Government in 1954, following the merger of the ''G\u00f6teborgs h\u00f6gskola'' (Gothenburg College) with the ''Medicinh\u00f6gskolan i G\u00f6teborg'' (Gothenburg Medical School){{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}.\n\nIn 1971, the originally separate [[Gothenburg School of Economics and Commercial Law]] became part of the University of Gothenburg.\n\n[[Sahlgrenska University Hospital]] is associated with the university as a teaching hospital. The Sahlgrenska Hospital was founded in 1772 following a donation by Niclas Sahlgren, and is the largest in Northern Europe.\n\nIn the 1990s the ''School of Economics'' and the ''Academy of Music, Drama and Opera'' have moved to new buildings in the city centre. A new campus for the ''Faculty of Education'' (teacher training) was opened in central Gothenburg in 2006.\n\nThe University of Gothenburg is a pronounced city university, that is most of its facilities are within the city centre of [[Gothenburg]]. The main building as well as most faculties are located in the central part of Gothenburg.\n\nGothenburg has a great academic excellence, originating from the University of Gothenburg, Chalmers University of Technology and the Sahlgrenska University Hospital, to face these challenges. It has a strong tradition of innovation, resulting in for example Losec, the Br\u00e5nemark implant, drugs against Parkinson\u2019s and most recently, the first ever completed pregnancy from a transplanted uterus. \nTogether with Uppsala, Lund, and Stockholm universities, it is one of four large international research universities in Sweden.\n\n== Structure ==\n\n===Management===\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer    = The entrance (left) to and the auditorium (right) of the main administrative building of the university.\n| image1    = University of Gothenburg.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Gbg universitet adm aula mot podium.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n  }}\nThe University of Gothenburg is one of Sweden\u2019s largest universities.

''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 1</ref>\n\nFilms can also be classified by the setting, theme, topic, mood, format, target audience or budget. The setting is the environment where the story and action take place (e.g., a [[war film]], a [[Western film]], or a [[space opera|space-opera film]]). The theme or topic refers to the issues or concepts that the film revolves around (e.g., [[science-fiction film]], [[sports film]], or [[crime film]]). The mood is the emotional tone of the film (e.g., [[comedy film]], [[horror film]], or tearjerker film). Format refers to the way the film was shot (e.g., [[35&nbsp;mm]], [[16&nbsp;mm]] or [[8&nbsp;mm film|8&nbsp;mm]]) or the manner of presentation (e.g.: [[anamorphic widescreen]]). Additional ways of categorizing film genres may involve the target audience (e.g., [[children's film]], [[teen film]] or [[women's film]]) or by type of [[film production | production]] (e.g., [[B movie]], [[Blockbuster (entertainment) |big-budget blockbuster]] or [[low-budget film]]). ''Genre'' does not just refer to the type of film or its category; spectator expectations about a film, and institutional discourses that create generic structures also play a key role.<ref name=\"autogenerated185\">\nHayward, Susan. \"Genre/Sub-genre\" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 185-192\n</ref>\nGenres are not fixed; they change and evolve over time, and some genres may largely disappear (for example, the melodrama).<ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe term \"genre\" was used to organize films according to type since the earliest days of cinema.<ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/> By the 1950s, [[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]] was discussing the concept of \"genre\" by using the [[Western (genre)#Film|Western film]] as an example; during this era, there was a debate over [[auteur theory]] versus genre.<ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/> In the late 1960s, the concept of genre became a significant part of [[film theory]].<ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/>\n\nFilm genres draw on genres from other forms; Western novels existed before the Western film, and [[musical theatre]] existed before film musicals were made.<ref>Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 4</ref> The perceived genre of a film can change over time; for example, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903) is seen in the 2010s as a key early Western film, but when it was released, it was seen as related to the \"then-popular genres of the chase film, the railroad film and the crime film\".<ref>Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 6</ref> A key reason that the early Hollywood industrial system from the 1920s to the 1950s favoured genre films is that in \"Hollywood's industrial mode of production, genre movies are dependable products\" to market to audiences, they are easy to produce and it is easy for audiences to understand a genre film.<ref>Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 7-8</ref> In the 1920s to 1950s, genre films had clear conventions and iconography, such as the heavy coats worn by gangsters in films like ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1931).<ref>Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 8</ref> The conventions in genre films enable filmmakers to create them in an industrial, assembly line fashion, an approach which can be seen in the [[James Bond]] spy films, which all use a formula of \"lots of action, fancy gadgets, beautiful woman and colourful villains\", even though the actors, directors and screenwriters changed.  <ref>Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 8</ref>\n\n==Pure and hybrid genres==\nFilms are rarely purely from one genre, which is in keeping with the cinema's diverse and derivative origins, it being a blend of \"vaudeville, music-hall, theatre, photography\" and novels.<ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/> American film historian [[Janet Staiger]] states that the genre of a film can be defined in four ways. The \"idealist method\" judges films by predetermined standards. The \"empirical method\" identifies the genre of a film by comparing it to a list of films already deemed to fall within a certain genre. The [[A priori knowledge|apriori]] method uses common generic elements which are identified in advance. The \"social conventions\" method of identifying the genre of a film is based on the accepted cultural consensus within society.<ref name=\"Grant\"/> Martin Loop contends that [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films are not pure genres because most Hollywood movies blend the love-oriented plot of the romance genre with other genres.<ref name=\"Grant\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCQOwvI9vsAC|title=Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology|last=Grant|first=Barry Keith|date=2007|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=9781904764793|language=en}}</ref> Jim Colins claims that since the 1980s, Hollywood films have been influenced by the trend towards \"ironic hybridization\", in which directors combine elements from different genres, as with the Western/science fiction mix in ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]''.<ref name=\"Grant\"/>\n\nMany films cross into multiple genres. Susan Hayward states that spy films often cross genre boundaries with thriller films. <ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/> Some genre films take genre elements from one genre and place them into the conventions of a second genre, such as with ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' (1953), which adds film noir and detective film elements into \"The Girl Hunt\" ballet.<ref>Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 8</ref> In the 1970s [[New Hollywood]] era, there was so much parodying of genres that it can be hard to assign genres to some films from this era, such as [[Mel Brooks]]' comedy-Western ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974) or the private eye parody ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973). <ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/> Other films from this era bend genres so much that it is challenging to put them in a genre category, such as [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974) and [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971).<ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/> \n\n[[Film theory|Film theorist]] [[Robert Stam]] challenged whether genres really exist, or whether they are merely made up by critics. Stam has questioned whether \"genres [are] really 'out there' in the world or are they really the construction of analysts?\". As well, he has asked whether there is a \"... finite taxonomy of genres or are they in principle infinite?\" and whether genres are \"...timeless essences ephemeral, time-bound entities? Are genres culture-bound or trans-cultural?\" Stam has also asked whether genre analysis should aim at being descriptive or prescriptive. While some genres are based on story content (the [[war film]]), other are borrowed from literature ([[Comedic genres|comedy]], [[melodrama]]) or from other media (the [[musical film|musical]]). Some are performer-based ([[Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers]] films) or budget-based ([[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]], [[low budget film]]), while others are based on artistic status (the [[art film]]), racial identity ([[Race films]]), location (the [[Western (genre)|Western]]), or sexual orientation ([[Queer cinema]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzRXmmpFgZEC|title=Film Theory: An Anthology|last=Stam|first=Robert|date=2000-02-21|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780631206545|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Audience expectations ==\nMany genres have built-in [[audience]]s and corresponding publications that support them, such as magazines and websites. For example, horror films have a well-established fanbase that reads horror magazines such as ''[[Fangoria]]''. Films that are difficult to categorize into a genre are often less successful. As such, film genres are also useful in the areas of marketing, [[film criticism]] and the analysis of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Hollywood story consultant [[John Truby]] states that \"...you have to know how to transcend the forms [genres] so you can give the audience a sense of originality and surprise.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.writersstore.com/whats-my-genre/|title=What's My Genre?|last=Truby|first=John|authorlink=John Truby|date=|website=Writers Store|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> \n\nSome [[screenwriter]]s use genre as a means of determining what kind of plot or content to put into a screenplay. They may study films of specific genres to find examples. This is a way that some screenwriters are able to copy elements of successful movies and pass them off in a new [[screenplay]]. It is likely that such screenplays fall short in originality. As Truby says, \"Writers know enough to write a genre script but they haven\u2019t twisted the story beats of that genre in such a way that it gives an original face to it\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scriptmag.com/earticles/earticle.htm|title=Interview: John Truby on Screenwriting and Breaking In|last=Ward|first=Lewis|date=|work=Script Magazine|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2007-07-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702182835/http://www.scriptmag.com/earticles/earticle.htm|archivedate=2007-07-02}}</ref>\n\nCinema technologies are associated with genres. Huge widescreens helped Western films to create an expansive setting of the open plains and desert. Science fiction and fantasy films are associated with special effects, notably computer generated imagery (e.g., the Harry Potter films).<ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/>\n\n== Grouping vs. genre ==\nThere are other methods of dividing films into groups besides genre. For example, [[auteur]] critics group films according to their auteur-directors. Production attributes, such as the [[low-budget film]], can also be considered a grouping. Some groupings may be casually described as genres although the definition is questionable.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} For example, while [[independent film]]s are sometimes discussed as if they are a genre in-and-of themselves, independent productions can belong to any genre. Similarly, while [[art film]]s are referred to as a genre by film scholar [[David Bordwell]], who states that \"art cinema itself is a [film] genre, with its own distinct conventions\",<ref name=\"Grant\" /> an art film can be in a number of genres (e.g., [[drama]], [[experimental film]], [[black comedy]], etc.).\n\n==Categorization==\n[[File:All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film) poster.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[War film]] or [[Anti-war film|anti-war movie]]: [[Lewis Milestone]]'s ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', 1930]]\nBecause genres are easier to recognize than to define, academics agree they cannot be identified in a rigid way.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUNBpwAACAAJ|title=Film Art: An Introduction|last=Thompson|first=Kristin|last2=Bordwell|first2=David|date=2012-07-06|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=|isbn=9780073535104|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref> Furthermore, different countries and cultures define genres in different ways. A typical example are war movies. In US, they are mostly related to the two World Wars whereas, in other countries, movies related to wars in other historical periods are considered ''war movies''.\n\nFilm genres may appear to be readily categorizable from the setting of the film. Nevertheless, films with the same settings can be very different, due to the use of different themes or moods. For example, while both ''[[Midway (1976 film)|The Battle of Midway]]''  and ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]''  are set in a [[war]]time context and might be classified as belonging to the [[war film]] genre, the first examines the themes of honor, sacrifice, and valour, and the second is an [[anti-war film]] which emphasizes the pain and horror of war. While there is an argument that [[film noir]] movies could be deemed to be set in an urban setting, in cheap hotels and underworld bars, many classic noirs take place mainly in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dxis1i4jxVwC|title=Architecture and Film|last=Lamster|first=Mark|date=2000|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=9781568982076|page=217}}</ref>\n\nThe editors of filmsite.org argue that animation, [[pornographic film]], documentary film, [[silent film]] and so on are non-genre-based film categories.<ref name=\"filmsite\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/genres2.html |title=Other Major Film Categories |publisher=filmsite.org|accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref>\n\n[[Linda Williams (film critic)|Linda Williams]] argues that horror, melodrama, and pornography all fall into the category of \"body genres\" since they are each designed to elicit physical reactions on the part of viewers. Horror is designed to elicit spine-chilling, white-knuckled, eye-bulging terror; melodramas are designed to make viewers cry after seeing the misfortunes of the onscreen characters; and pornography is designed to elicit sexual arousal.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} This approach can be extended: comedies make people laugh, tear-jerkers make people cry, feel-good films lift people's spirits and inspiration films provide hope for viewers.\n\nA genre movie is a film that follows some or all of the conventions of a particular genre, whether or not it was intentional when the movie was produced.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbKuuBqBWg8C|title=Journalists in Film: Heroes and Villains|last=McNair|first=Brian|date=2010|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748634477|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Film and history==\nIn order to understand the creation and context of each film genre, we must look at its popularity in the context of its place in history. For example, the 1970s [[Blaxploitation]] films have been called an attempt to \"undermine the rise of Afro-American's Black consciousness movement\" of that era.<ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/>  In William Park's analysis of film noir, he states that we must view and interpret film for its message with the context of history within our minds; he states that this is how film can truly be understood by its audience.<ref name=\"What is Film Noir?\"> Park W. What Is Film Noir? [e-book]. Lanham, Md: Bucknell University Press; 2011. Available from: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost), Ipswich, MA. Accessed November 19, 2017.</ref> Film genres such as [[film noir]] and [[Western film]] reflect values of the time period. While film noir combines German expressionist filming strategies with post World War II ideals; Western films focused on the ideal of the early 20th century. Films such as the [[Musical film|musical]] were created as a form of entertainment during the [[Great Depression]] allowing its viewers an escape during tough times. So when watching and analyzing film genres we must remember to remember its true intentions aside from its entertainment value.\n\nOver time, a genre can change through stages: the classic genre era; the parody of the classics; the period where filmmakers deny that their films are part of a certain genre; and finally a critique of the entire genre.<ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/> This pattern can be seen with the Western film. In the earliest, classic Westerns, there was a clear hero who protected society from lawless villains who lived in the wilderness and came into civilization to commit crimes.<ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/> However, in [[revisionist Western]]s of the 1970s, the protagonist becomes an [[anti-hero]] who lives in the wilderness to get away from a civilization that is depicted as corrupt, with the villains now integrated into society. Another example of a genre changing over time is the popularity of the [[neo-noir]] films in the early 2000s (''[[Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'' (2001) and ''[[Far From Heaven]]'' (2002); are these film noir parodies, a repetition of noir genre tropes, or a re-examination of the noir genre?<ref name=\"autogenerated185\"/> \n\nThis is also important to remember when looking at films in the future. As viewers watch a film they are conscious of societal influence with the film itself. In order to understand it's true intentions, we must identify its intended audience and what narrative of our current society, as well as it comments to the past in relation with today's society. This enables viewers to understand the evolution of film genres as time and history morphs or views and ideals of the entertainment industry.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Film]]\n* [[Glossary of motion picture terms]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* Friedman, Lester et al.

It is the oldest of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], and the only one to remain largely intact.\n\nBased on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a reference to the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|fourth dynasty]] [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] Pharaoh [[Khufu]], [[Egyptologists]] believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10- to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially at {{convert|146.5|m|ft|abbr=off}}, the Great Pyramid was the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world#History|tallest man-made structure]] in the world for more than 3,800 years. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by limestone casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative theories about the Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a [[quarry]] and dragging and lifting them into place.\n\nThere are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest chamber is cut into the bedrock upon which the pyramid was built and was unfinished. The so-called<ref name=Romer2007-8>\"By themselves, of course, none of these modern labels define the ancient purposes of the architecture they describe.\"&nbsp;\u2014{{harvp|Romer|2007|p=8}}</ref> Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber are higher up within the pyramid structure. The main part of the Giza complex is a set of buildings that included two [[mortuary temples]] in honour of Khufu (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile), three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives, an even smaller \"satellite\" pyramid, a raised causeway connecting the two temples, and small [[mastaba]] tombs surrounding the pyramid for nobles.\n[[File:007 Khufu.jpg|thumb|Transparent view of Khufu's pyramid from SE. Taken from a 3d model]]\n\n==History and description==\n{{Ancient_seven_wonders_timeline.svg|left}}\n[[Egyptology|Egyptologists]] believe the pyramid was built as a tomb for the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] pharaoh [[Khufu]] (often Hellenized as \"Cheops\") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]], [[Hemiunu]] (also called Hemon) is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid.<ref>{{harvp|Shaw|2003|p=89}}</ref> It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal [[cubit]]s tall ({{Convert|146.5|m|ft|1}}), but with [[erosion]] and absence of its [[pyramidion]], its present height is {{Convert|138.8|m|ft|1}}. Each base side was 440&nbsp;[[cubit]]s, {{Convert|230.4|m|ft|1}} long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9&nbsp;million [[tonne]]s. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly {{convert|2,500,000|m3|abbr=out}}<!--2,500,000&nbsp;cubic metres-->.<ref>{{harvp|Levy|2005|p=17}}</ref>\n\nBased on these estimates, building the pyramid in 20 years would involve installing approximately 800 tonnes of stone every day. Additionally, since it consists of an estimated 2.3&nbsp;million blocks, completing the building in 20 years would involve moving an average of more than 12 of the blocks into place each hour, day and night. The first precision measurements of the pyramid were made by Egyptologist [[Flinders Petrie|Sir Flinders Petrie]] in 1880\u201382 and published as ''The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh''.<ref name=\"pet\">{{harvp|Petrie|1883}}</ref> Almost all reports are based on his measurements. Many of the casing-stones and inner chamber blocks of the Great Pyramid fit together with extremely high precision.

The ratio of the perimeter to height of 1760/280 Egyptian Royal cubits equates to 2[[pi|\u03c0]] to an accuracy of better than 0.05 percent (corresponding to the well-known approximation of \u03c0 as 22/7). Some Egyptologists consider this to have been the result of deliberate design proportion.

Traditionally,{{clarify|date=November 2017|comment=Does \"traditionally\" mean that this is the traditional explanation?

As the water was absorbed, the wedges expanded, causing the rock to crack. Once they were cut, they were carried by boat either up or down the [[Nile River]] to the pyramid.<ref>{{harvp|Lehner|1997}}</ref> It is estimated that 5.5&nbsp;million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite (imported from Aswan), and 500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in the construction of the Great Pyramid.<ref>{{harvp|Romer|2007|p=157}}</ref>\n\n===Casing stones===\n[[File:KhufuPyramidCasingStone-BritishMuseum-August19-08.jpg|thumb|Casing stone in the [[British Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/l/limestone_block_from_the_pyram.aspx|title=British Museum \u2013 Limestone block from the pyramid of Khufu|work=britishmuseum.org}}</ref></blockquote>]] At completion, the Great Pyramid was surfaced by white \"casing stones\"\u2014slant-faced, but flat-topped, blocks of highly polished white [[limestone]]. These were carefully cut to what is approximately a face slope with a [[seked]] of 5\u00bd palms to give the required dimensions. Visibly, all that remains is the underlying stepped core structure seen today. In AD&nbsp;1303, a [[1303 Crete earthquake|massive earthquake]] loosened many of the outer casing stones, which were then carted away by [[Bahri dynasty|Bahri Sultan]] An-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan in 1356 to build mosques and fortresses in nearby [[Cairo]]. Many more casing stones were removed from the great pyramids by Muhammad Ali Pasha in the early 19th century to build the upper portion of his [[Alabaster Mosque]] in Cairo, not far from Giza. These limestone casings can still be seen as parts of these structures. Later explorers reported massive piles of rubble at the base of the pyramids left over from the continuing collapse of the casing stones, which were subsequently cleared away during continuing excavations of the site.\n\nNevertheless, a few of the casing stones from the lowest course can be seen to this day ''[[In situ conservation (archaeology)|in situ]]'' around the base of the Great Pyramid, and display the same workmanship and precision that has been reported for centuries. [[Sir Flinders Petrie|Petrie]] also found a different orientation in the core and in the casing measuring 193&nbsp;centimetres \u00b1 25 centimetres. He suggested a redetermination of north was made after the construction of the core, but a mistake was made, and the casing was built with a different orientation.<ref name=\"pet\"/> Petrie related the precision of the casing stones as to being \"equal to opticians' work of the present day, but on a scale of acres\" and \"to place such stones in exact contact would be careful work; but to do so with cement in the joints seems almost impossible\".<ref>{{harvp|Romer|2007|p=41}}</ref> It has been suggested it was the mortar (Petrie's \"cement\") that made this seemingly impossible task possible, providing a level bed, which enabled the masons to set the stones exactly.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Somers|title=Ancient Egyptian construction and architecture|year=1991|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-26485-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L0Uiat5EAaMC&pg=PA78|author2=Reginal Engelbach|pages=78\u201379}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Stocks|first=Denys Allen|title=Experiments in Egyptian archaeology: stoneworking technology in ancient Egypt|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-30664-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oLDuHvQODoIC&pg=PA182|pages=182\u2013183}}</ref>\n\n===Construction theories===\n{{Main article|Egyptian pyramid construction techniques}}\n[[File:Khufu seal.jpg|thumb|right|Clay seal bearing the name of Khufu from the Great Pyramid.

The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] believed that slave labour was used, but modern discoveries made at nearby workers' camps associated with construction at Giza suggest that it was built instead by tens of thousands of skilled workers. Verner posited that the labour was organized into a [[hierarchy]], consisting of two ''gangs'' of 100,000 men, divided into five ''zaa'' or ''[[phyle]]'' of 20,000 men each, which may have been further divided according to the skills of the workers.<ref>{{harvp|Verner|2001|pp=75\u201382}}</ref>\n\nOne mystery of the pyramid's construction is its planning. [[John Romer (Egyptologist)|John Romer]] suggests that they used the same method that had been used for earlier and later constructions, laying out parts of the plan on the ground at a 1-to-1 scale. He writes that \"such a working diagram would also serve to generate the architecture of the pyramid with precision unmatched by any other means\".<ref>{{harvp|Romer|2007| pp=327, 329\u2013337}}</ref> He also argues for a 14-year time-span for its construction.<ref name=Romer81>{{harvp|Romer|2007}}</ref> A modern construction management study, in association with [[Mark Lehner]] and other Egyptologists, estimated that the total project required an average workforce of about 14,500 people and a peak workforce of roughly 40,000. Without the use of pulleys, wheels, or iron tools, they used [[critical path analysis]] methods, which suggest that the Great Pyramid was completed from start to finish in approximately 10 years.<ref name=\"civilengineer\">{{cite journal|title=Civil Engineering |date=June 1999 |url=http://www.pubs.asce.org/ceonline/0699feat.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608101037/http://www.pubs.asce.org/ceonline/0699feat.html |archivedate=8 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Interior==\n[[File:Great Pyramid Diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of the interior structures of the Great Pyramid.

There is a continuation of the horizontal passage in the south wall of the lower chamber; there is also a pit dug in the floor of the chamber. Some Egyptologists suggest that this Lower Chamber was intended to be the original burial chamber, but Pharaoh Khufu later changed his mind and wanted it to be higher up in the pyramid.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/pyramid/explore/khufuunfhi.html|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]|title=Unfinished Chamber|accessdate=11 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{convert|28.2|m|ft}} from the entrance is a square hole in the roof of the Descending Passage.

The lower end of the Ascending Passage is closed by three huge blocks of granite, each about {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} long. One must use the Robbers' Tunnel (see below) to access the Ascending Passage. At the start of the Grand Gallery on the right-hand side there is a hole cut in the wall.

The horizontal distance was cut in 1872 by a British engineer, Waynman Dixon, who believed a shaft similar to those in the King's Chamber must also exist. He was proved right, but because the shafts are not connected to the outer faces of the pyramid or the Queen's Chamber, their purpose is unknown. At the end of one of his shafts, Dixon discovered a ball of black [[diorite]] (a type of rock) and a bronze implement of unknown purpose.

The purpose was to have each block supported by the wall of the Gallery, rather than resting on the block beneath it, in order to prevent cumulative pressure.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kingsland |first=William |date=1932 |title=The Great pyramid in fact and in theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OieJ8015ODEC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71#v=onepage&q&f=false |location=London |publisher=Rider |page=71|isbn=9780787304973 }}</ref>\n\nAt the upper end of the Gallery on the right-hand side there is a hole near the roof that opens into a short tunnel by which access can be gained to the lowest of the Relieving Chambers. The other Relieving Chambers were discovered in 1837\u20131838 by [[Richard William Howard Vyse|Colonel Howard Vyse]] and [[John Shae Perring|J. S. Perring]], who dug tunnels upwards using blasting powder.\n\nThe floor of the Grand Gallery consists of a shelf or step on either side, {{convert|51|cm|in}} wide, leaving a lower ramp {{convert|1.04|m|ft}} wide between them. In the shelves there are 54 slots, 27 on each side matched by vertical and horizontal slots in the walls of the Gallery. These form a cross shape that rises out of the slot in the shelf. The purpose of these slots is not known, but the central gutter in the floor of the Gallery, which is the same width as the Ascending Passage, has led to speculation that the blocking stones were stored in the Grand Gallery and the slots held wooden beams to restrain them from sliding down the passage.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lehner |first=Mark |date=1997 |title=The Complete Pyramids |location=London |publisher=Thames and Hudson |page=113 |isbn=0-500-05084-8}}</ref> This, in turn, has led to the proposal that originally many more than 3 blocking stones were intended, to completely fill the Ascending Passage.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nAt the top of the Grand Gallery, there is a step giving onto a horizontal passage some metres long and approximately {{convert|1.02|m|ft}} in height and width, in which can be detected four slots, three of which were probably intended to hold granite [[portcullises]]. Fragments of granite found by [[Sir Flinders Petrie|Petrie]] in the Descending Passage may have come from these now-vanished doors.\n\n===The Big Void===\nIn 2017, scientists from the [[Scanpyramids|ScanPyramids]] project discovered a large cavity above the Grand Gallery using [[muon radiography]], which they called the \"ScanPyramids Big Void\". Its length is at least {{convert|30|m|ft}} and its cross-section is similar to that of the Grand Gallery. Its existence was confirmed by independent detection with three different technologies: [[nuclear emulsion]] films, [[scintillator]] [[hodoscope]]s, and [[gas detector]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/great-pyramid-giza-void-discovered-khufu-archaeology-science/|title=Mysterious Void Discovered in Egypt's Great Pyramid|date=2 November 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaap/ncurrent/full/nature24647.html|title=Discovery of a big void in Khufu's Pyramid by observation of cosmic-ray muons|first1=Kunihiro|last1=Morishima|first2=Mitsuaki|last2=Kuno|first3=Akira|last3=Nishio|first4=Nobuko|last4=Kitagawa|first5=Yuta|last5=Manabe|first6=Masaki|last6=Moto|first7=Fumihiko|last7=Takasaki|first8=Hirofumi|last8=Fujii|first9=Kotaro|last9=Satoh|first10=Hideyo|last10=Kodama|first11=Kohei|last11=Hayashi|first12=Shigeru|last12=Odaka|first13=S\u00e9bastien|last13=Procureur|first14=David|last14=Atti\u00e9|first15=Simon|last15=Bouteille|first16=Denis|last16=Calvet|first17=Christopher|last17=Filosa|first18=Patrick|last18=Magnier|first19=Irakli|last19=Mandjavidze|first20=Marc|last20=Riallot|first21=Benoit|last21=Marini|first22=Pierre|last22=Gable|first23=Yoshikatsu|last23=Date|first24=Makiko|last24=Sugiura|first25=Yasser|last25=Elshayeb|first26=Tamer|last26=Elnady|first27=Mustapha|last27=Ezzy|first28=Emmanuel|last28=Guerriero|first29=Vincent|last29=Steiger|first30=Nicolas|last30=Serikoff|first31=Jean-Baptiste|last31=Mouret|first32=Bernard|last32=Charl\u00e8s|first33=Hany|last33=Helal|first34=Mehdi|last34=Tayoubi|author-link34=Mehdi Tayoubi|date=2 November 2017|publisher=|journal=Nature|volume=552|issue=7685|pages=386|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/nature24647|pmid=29160306|bibcode=2017Natur.552..386M|arxiv=1711.01576}}</ref> The purpose of the cavity is not known and it is not accessible but according to [[Zahi Hawass]] it may have been a gap used in the construction of the Grand Gallery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/scientists-discover-hidden-chamber-egypts-great-pyramid-50881797|title=Scientists discover hidden chamber in Egypt's Great Pyramid|first=ABC|last=News|publisher=}}</ref> The Japanese research team disputes this, however, saying that the huge void is completely different from the construction spaces previously identified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201711070057.html|title=Critics: Nothing special about big void found in Khufu Pyramid\uff1aThe Asahi Shimbun|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===King's Chamber===\n[[File:S10.08 Gizeh, image 9620.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sarcophagus in the King's chamber]]\nThe \"King's Chamber\"<ref name=Romer2007-8/> is 20 Egyptian Royal cubits or {{convert|10.47|m|ft}} from east to west and 10 cubits or {{convert|5.234|m|ft}} north to south. It has a flat roof 11 cubits and 5 digits or 5.852 metres (19 feet 2 inch) above the floor. {{convert|0.91|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the floor there are two narrow shafts in the north and south walls (one is now filled by an extractor fan in an attempt to circulate air inside the pyramid). The purpose of these shafts is not clear: they appear to be aligned towards stars or areas of the northern and southern skies, yet one of them follows a [[Dog-leg (stairs)|dog-leg course]] through the masonry, indicating no intention to directly sight stars through them. They were long believed by Egyptologists to be \"air shafts\" for ventilation, but this idea has now been widely abandoned in favour of the shafts serving a ritualistic purpose associated with the ascension of the king\u2019s spirit to the heavens.<ref name=\"Stamp 2002 pp153\">{{harvp|Jackson|Stamp|2002|pp=79, 104}}</ref>\n\nThe King's Chamber is entirely faced with granite. Above the roof, which is formed of nine slabs of stone weighing in total about 400 tons, are five compartments known as Relieving Chambers. The first four, like the King's Chamber, have flat roofs formed by the floor of the chamber above, but the final chamber has a pointed roof. Vyse suspected the presence of upper chambers when he found that he could push a long reed through a crack in the ceiling of the first chamber. From lower to upper, the chambers are known as \"[[Nathaniel Davison|Davison]]'s Chamber\", \"[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s Chamber\", \"[[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s Chamber\", \"[[Arbuthnot baronets|Lady Arbuthnot]]'s Chamber\", and \"[[Patrick Campbell (1779\u20131857)|Campbell]]'s Chamber\". It is believed that the compartments were intended to safeguard the King's Chamber from the possibility of a roof collapsing under the weight of stone above the Chamber. As the chambers were not intended to be seen, they were not finished in any way and a few of the stones still retain masons' marks painted on them. One of the stones in Campbell's Chamber bears a mark, apparently the name of a work gang.<ref name=\"archive.org\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/operationscarrie01howa|title=Vyse, H.

The sarcophagus is slightly larger than the Ascending Passage, which indicates that it must have been placed in the Chamber before the roof was put in place. Unlike the fine masonry of the walls of the Chamber, the sarcophagus is roughly finished, with saw-marks visible in several places. This is in contrast with the finely finished and decorated sarcophagi found in other pyramids of the same period. [[Flinders Petrie|Petrie]] suggested that such a sarcophagus was intended but was lost in the river on the way north from [[Aswan]] and a hurriedly made replacement was used instead.\n\n===Modern entrance===\nToday tourists enter the Great Pyramid via the Robbers' Tunnel, a tunnel purportedly<!--Purportedly because German Wikipedia says there is doubt that al-Ma'mun actually created it -- he may have just refurbished a tunnel that had been made much earlier.--> created around AD 820 by Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]]'s workmen using a battering ram.<ref name=\"Tyldesley, 2007 p. 38\">{{harvp|Tyldesley|2007|p=38}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=18}}</ref> The tunnel is cut straight through the masonry of the pyramid for approximately {{convert|27|m|ft}}, then turns sharply left to encounter the blocking stones in the Ascending Passage. It is believed that their efforts dislodged the stone fitted in the ceiling of the Descending Passage to hide the entrance to the Ascending Passage and it was the noise of that stone falling and then sliding down the Descending Passage, which alerted them to the need to turn left. Unable to remove these stones, however, the workmen tunnelled up beside them through the softer limestone of the Pyramid until they reached the Ascending Passage. It is possible to enter the Descending Passage from this point, but access is usually forbidden.<ref>{{harvp|Tyldesley|2007|pp=38\u201340}}</ref>\n\n==Pyramid complex==\n{{Main article|Giza pyramid complex}}\n[[File:Giza pyramid complex (map).svg|thumb|left|Map of Giza pyramid complex \u2013 \"Pyramid of Khufu\" refers to the Great Pyramid.]]\n\nThe Great Pyramid is surrounded by a complex of several buildings including small pyramids. The Pyramid Temple, which stood on the east side of the pyramid and measured {{convert|52.2|m|ft}} north to south and {{convert|40|m|ft}} east to west, has almost entirely disappeared apart from the black basalt paving. There are only a few remnants of the causeway which linked the pyramid with the valley and the Valley Temple.

He theorizes that such a saw could have been attached to a wooden [[trestle]] and possibly used in conjunction with vegetable oil, cutting sand, emery or pounded quartz to cut the blocks, which would have required the labour of at least a dozen men to operate it.<ref>{{harvp|Romer|2007pp=164, 165}}</ref>\n\nOn the south side are the subsidiary pyramids, popularly known as the Queens' Pyramids. Three remain standing to nearly full height but the fourth was so ruined that its existence was not suspected until the recent discovery of the first course of stones and the remains of the capstone. Hidden beneath the paving around the pyramid was the tomb of [[Hetepheres I|Queen Hetepheres I]], sister-wife of [[Sneferu]] and mother of [[Khufu]]. Discovered by accident by the Reisner expedition, the burial was intact, though the carefully sealed coffin proved to be empty.\n[[File:Australian 11th Battalion group photo.jpg|thumb|Group photo of [[Australian 11th Battalion]] soldiers on the Great Pyramid in 1915.]]\n[[File:Spelterini Pyramids.jpg|thumb|[[Aerial photography]], taken from [[Eduard Spelterini]]'s balloon on 21 November 1904]]\n\nThe Giza pyramid complex, which includes among other structures the pyramids of Khufu, [[Pyramid of Khafre|Khafre]] and [[Pyramid of Menkaure|Menkaure]], is surrounded by a [[Cyclopean masonry|cyclopean]] stone wall, the Wall of the Crow. [[Mark Lehner]] has discovered a worker's town outside of the wall, otherwise known as \"The Lost City\", dated by pottery styles, seal impressions, and [[stratigraphy]] to have been constructed and occupied sometime during the reigns of Khafre (2520\u20132494 BC) and Menkaure (2490\u20132472 BC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeraweb.org/projects/lost-city/|title=Egyptian Pyramids \u2013 Lost City of the Pyramid Builders \u2013 AERA \u2013 Ancient Egypt Research Associates|work=aeraweb.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeraweb.org/lost-city-project/dating-the-lost-city/|title=Dating the Lost City of the Pyramids \u2013 Mark Lehner & AERA \u2013 Ancient Egypt Research Associates|work=aeraweb.org}}</ref> In the early 21st century, Mark Lehner and his team made several discoveries, including what appears to have been a thriving port, suggesting the town and associated living quarters, which consisted of barracks called \"galleries\", may not have been for the pyramid workers after all but rather for the soldiers and sailors who utilized the port. In light of this new discovery, as to where then the pyramid workers may have lived, Lehner suggested the alternative possibility they may have camped on the ramps he believes were used to construct the pyramids or possibly at nearby quarries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/42902-giza-pyramids-port-discovered.html |title=Ruins of Bustling Port Unearthed at Egypt's Giza Pyramids |publisher=Livescience.com |date=2014-01-28 |accessdate=2014-08-21}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Australian archaeologist [[Karl Kromer]] excavated a mound in the South Field of the plateau.

In May 1954, the Egyptian archaeologist [[Kamal el-Mallakh]] discovered a fourth pit, a long, narrow rectangle, still covered with slabs of stone weighing up to 15 tons. Inside were 1,224 pieces of wood, the longest {{convert|23|m|ft}} long, the shortest {{convert|10|cm|ft}}. These were entrusted to a boat builder, Haj Ahmed Yusuf, who worked out how the pieces fit together. The entire process, including conservation and straightening of the warped wood, took fourteen years.\n\nThe result is a cedar-wood boat {{convert|43.6|m|ft}} long, its timbers held together by ropes, which is currently housed in a special boat-shaped, air-conditioned museum beside the pyramid. During construction of this museum, which stands above the boat pit, a second sealed boat pit was discovered. It was deliberately left unopened until 2011 when excavation began on the boat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptpro.sci.waseda.ac.jp/e-khufu.html |title=Khufu's Second Boat |work=Institute of Egyptology |publisher=[[Waseda University]] |location=Tokyo, Japan |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref>\n\n==Looting==\n{{Comparison of pyramids.svg|ku}}\nAlthough succeeding pyramids were smaller, pyramid-building continued until the end of the Middle Kingdom.

E. S. Edwards]] discusses [[Strabo]]'s mention that the pyramid \"a little way up one side has a stone that may be taken out, which being raised up there is a sloping passage to the foundations\". Edwards suggested that the pyramid was entered by robbers after the end of the Old Kingdom and sealed and then reopened more than once until Strabo's door was added. He adds: \"If this highly speculative surmise be correct, it is also necessary to assume either that the existence of the door was forgotten or that the entrance was again blocked with facing stones\", in order to explain why al-Ma'mun could not find the entrance.<ref>{{harvp|Edwards|1986|pp=99\u2013100}}</ref>\n\nHe also discusses a story told by [[Herodotus]]. Herodotus visited Egypt in the 5th century BC and recounts a story that he was told concerning vaults under the pyramid built on an island where the body of Cheops lies. Edwards notes that the pyramid had \"almost certainly been opened and its contents plundered long before the time of Herodotus\" and that it might have been closed again during the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt]] when other monuments were restored. He suggests that the story told to Herodotus could have been the result of almost two centuries of telling and retelling by Pyramid guides.<ref>{{harvp|Edwards|1986|pp=990\u201391}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Djedi Project]]\n*[[Golden ratio#Egyptian pyramids|Golden Ratio dimensions in Egyptian pyramids]]\n*[[Index of Egypt-related articles]]\n*[[List of archaeoastronomical sites by country]]\n*[[List of Egyptian pyramids]]\n*[[List of largest monoliths]] including a section on calculating the weight of megaliths\n*[[List of tallest freestanding structures]]\n*[[Pyramid inch]]\n*[[Pyramidology]]\n*[[The Upuaut Project]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Keeper of Genesis|first=Hancock, Graham|last=Bauval, Robert & |year=1996|isbn=0-7493-2196-2|publisher=Mandarin books}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Daily Life of the Ancient Egyptians|first=Hobbs, A.

It was created by [[Steve Jackson Games]] and first published in 1986 at a time when most such systems were story- or genre-specific.\n\nPlayers control their in-game characters verbally and the success of their actions are determined by the skill of their character, the difficulty of the action, and the rolling of dice. Characters earn points during play which are used to gain greater abilities. Gaming sessions are story-told and run by \"[[Game Masters]]\" (often referred to as simply \"GMs\").\n\n''GURPS'' won the [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Roleplaying Rules of 1988'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1988|title=Origins Award Winners (1988)|publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505174856/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1988 |archivedate=May 5, 2009}}</ref> and in 2000 it was inducted into the [[Origins Game Fair#Hall of Fame|Origins Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1999/list-of-winners | title=Origins Award Winners (1999)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505171407/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1999/list-of-winners |archivedate=May 5, 2009}}</ref> Many of its expansions have also won awards.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prior RPG history===\nPrior to ''GURPS'', [[role-playing game|roleplaying game]]s (RPGs) of the 1970s and early 1980s were developed especially for certain gaming environments, and they were largely incompatible with one another. For example, [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] published its ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' game specifically for a [[fantasy]] environment. Another game from the same company, ''[[Star Frontiers]]'', was developed for [[science fiction]]\u2013based role-playing. TSR produced other games for other environments, such as ''[[Gamma World]]'' ([[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] adventures), ''[[Top Secret (game)|Top Secret]]'' ([[Espionage|spies]] and secret agents), ''[[Gangbusters (role-playing game)|Gangbusters]]'' ([[Roaring Twenties]] adventures), and ''[[Boot Hill (role-playing game)|Boot Hill]]'' ([[American Old West]]). Each of these games was set with its own self-contained [[Role-playing game system|rules system]], and the rules for playing each game differed greatly from one game to the next. Attempts were made in ''Advanced Dungeons and Dragons'' to allow cross-genre games using ''Gamma World'' and ''Boot Hill'' rules; however, characters could only be used in a new genre by converting their statistics. Though it was preceded by ''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'' ([[Chaosium]], 1980) and the [[Hero System]] ([[Hero Games]], a system that expanded to multiple genres starting in 1982),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory3.phtml|title=A Brief History of Game #3: Chaosium: 1975\u2013Present |author=Shannon Appelcline |date=September 4, 2006 |work= |publisher= |quote=They published a cut-down version of the ''RQ'' rules called ''Basic Role-Playing''. By extracting their core game engine they created the first generic roleplaying system, two years before the Hero System expanded beyond ''Champions'' and six years before ''The Fantasy Trip'' became ''GURPS''.|accessdate=July 4, 2012}}</ref> ''GURPS'' was the most commercially successful{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[generic role-playing game system]] to allow players to role-play in any environment they please while still using the same set of core rules. This flexibility of environment is greatly aided by the use of technology levels (or \"tech-levels\") that allow a campaign to be set from the Stone Age (TL-0) to the Digital Age (TL-8) or beyond.\n\n===The GURPS concept===\nRole-playing games of the 1970s and 1980s, such as ''Dungeons & Dragons'', generally used random numbers generated by dice rolls to assign statistics to player characters. ''GURPS'', following the lead of the [[Hero System]] first used by the ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'' role-playing game, assigned players a specified number of ''points'' with which to build their characters. These points were spent to get attributes, skills, and advantages, such as the ability to cast magic spells.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Rowland| first = Marcus L.| authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Open Box - GURPS: Generic Universal Roleplaying System Basic Set | type = review | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] | volume = | issue = 83 | pages =4 | publisher =[[Games Workshop]] |date=Nov 1986 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Additional points can be obtained by accepting lower-than-average attributes, disadvantages, and other limitations.\n\n''GURPS''<nowiki>'</nowiki> emphasis on its generic aspect has proven to be a successful marketing tactic, as many game series have source engines which can be retrofitted to many styles.<ref>{{cite book| last = Hite| first = Ken| authorlink = Ken Hite| title = Nightmares of Mine| publisher = [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]| year = 1999| pages = 171| edition = 1st| url = https://www.amazon.com/Nightmares-Mine-Rolemaster-Standard-System/dp/1558063676| isbn =1-55806-367-6}}</ref> Its approach to versatility includes using real world measurements wherever possible (\"reality-checking\" is an important part of any ''GURPS'' book).\n\n''GURPS'' also benefits from the many dozens of worldbooks describing settings or additional rules in all genres including science fiction, fantasy, and historical.

It promised to simplify and streamline most areas of play and character creation. The changes include modification of the attribute point adjustments, an edited and rationalized skill list, clarification of the differences between abilities from experience and from inborn talent, more detailed language rules, and revised technology levels.

For a beginning character in an average power game, the 4th edition suggests 100&ndash;150 points to modify attribute stats, select advantages and disadvantages, and purchase levels in skills. Normal [[Non-player character|NPCs]] are built on 25\u201350 points. Full-fledged heroes usually have 150&ndash;250 points, while superheroes are commonly built with 400&ndash;800 points.<ref name=\"rpgnet2\">{{cite web  | last=Smith  | first=Eli | title=GURPS Fourth Edition Basic Set Review | publisher=RPGNet.com  | date=2004-10-11 | url=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10731.phtml | type=review | accessdate=2008-12-08 }}</ref> The highest point value recorded for a canon character in a ''GURPS'' sourcebook is 10,452 for the Harvester (p.&nbsp;88) in ''[[GURPS Monsters]]''.<ref>{{cite book| last=Johnson | first=Hunter | title=GURPS: Monsters | publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]] | year=2002 | pages=128 | edition=3rd | url=http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/monsters/ | isbn=1-55634-518-6 }}</ref>\n\nIn principle, a Game Master can balance the power of foes to the abilities of the player characters by comparing their relative point values.\n\n===Attributes===\nCharacters in ''GURPS'' have four basic [[attribute (role-playing games)|attribute]]s:\n\n* '''Strength (ST)''': A measure of the character's physical power and bulk, ability to lift, carry, and do damage\n* '''Dexterity (DX)''': A measure of the character's physical agility, coordination, and manual dexterity\n* '''Intelligence (IQ)''': A measure of the character's mental capacity, acuity and sense of the world\n* '''Health (HT)''': A measure of the character's physical stamina, recovery speed, energy and vitality, ability to resist disease\n\nEach attribute has a number rating assigned to it. Normally they begin at 10, representing typical human ability, but can go as low as 1 for nearly useless, to 20 (or higher) for superhuman power. Anything in the 8 to 12 range is considered to be in the ''normal'' or ''average'' area for humans. Basic attribute scores of 6 or less are considered ''crippling''\u2014they are so far below the human norm that they are only used for severely handicapped characters. Scores of 15 or more are described as ''amazing''\u2014they are immediately apparent and draw constant comment.\n\nPlayers assign these ratings spending [[character point]]s. The higher the rating the more points it will cost the player, however, assigning a score below the average 10 gives the player points back to assign elsewhere.  Since almost all skills are based on Dexterity or Intelligence, those attributes are twice as expensive (or yield twice the points, if purchased below 10). In earlier editions (pre\u20134th Edition) all attributes followed the same cost-progression, where higher attributes cost more per increase than attributes close to the average of 10.\n\nAttribute scores also determine several ''secondary characteristics''. The four major ones are each directly based on a single attribute:\n\n*'''Hit Points (HP)''': how much damage and injury can be sustained, based on ''ST'' in 4e. In previous editions it was based on HT.\n*'''Will (Will)''': mental focus and strength, withstanding stress, based on ''IQ''.\n*'''Perception (Per)''': general sensory alertness, based on ''IQ''.\n*'''Fatigue Points (FP)''': a measure of exertion, tiredness, and hunger, based on ''HT'' in 4e. In previous editions it was based on ST.\n\nThe other secondary characteristics (Damage<!--(thrust/swing)-->, Basic Lift<!--[in lbs]-->, Basic Speed, Dodge, <!--Basic -->Move<!--(Ground/Water/Air) [in yard/sec]-->) are calculated from one or more attribute values using individual [[Mathematical table|table]]s or [[formula]]e.\n\n=== Character advantages and disadvantages ===\n''GURPS'' has a profusion of advantages and disadvantages which enable players or Game Masters to customize their characters. The myriad options available and the rewards the system provides players for carefully creating their characters are attractive to gamers who enjoy a high degree of flexibility in character design.\n\nA player can select numerous Advantages and Disadvantages to differentiate the character; the system supports both mundane traits (such as above-average or below-average Wealth, Status and Reputation) as well as more exotic special abilities and weaknesses. These are categorized as physical, mental or social, and as exotic, supernatural, or mundane. Advantages benefit the character and cost points to purchase. Selecting Disadvantages returns character points and allows players to limit their characters in one way in exchange for being more powerful or gifted in other areas. Disadvantages include such positive attributes as honesty and truthfulness which limit the way a character is played. There are also many Perks and Quirks to choose from which give a character some personality. Perks (minor Advantages) and Quirks (minor Disadvantages) benefit or hinder the character a bit, but they mostly add role-playing flavor.\n\nEnhancements and limitations can tailor an advantage or disadvantage to suit creative players. These modify the effects and point cost of advantages and disadvantages. For example, to create a \"dragon's breath\" attack, a player would select the Innate Attack ability (the ability that allows a player to perform an attack most humans could not), and select burning attack 4D (normally 20 points). Then, the player would modify it as follows: cone, 5 yards (+100%); limited use, 3/day (-20%); reduced range, x1/5 (-20%). The final percentage modifier would be +60%, making the final cost 32 points. This addition to the system greatly increases its flexibility while decreasing the number of specific advantages and disadvantages that must be listed. Finally, ''mitigators'' can themselves tailor advantages and disadvantages (see ''[[GURPS Bio-Tech]]'' for such an example).\n\n===Skills===\n''GURPS'' has a wide variety of [[skill (role-playing)|skill]]s intended to enable it to support any conceivable genre (such as [[Acrobatics]] and  Vehicle Piloting). Each skill is tied to at least one attribute, and the characters' abilities in that skill is a function of their base attributes + or - a certain amount.\n\nThe availability of skills depends on the particular genre the ''GURPS'' game is played. For instance, in a generic [[medieval]] [[fantasy]] setting, skills for operating a [[computer]], or flying a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter jet]] would not normally be available. Skills are rated by level, and the more levels purchased with character points, the better the characters are at that particular skill relative to their base attribute.\n\nSkills are categorized by difficulty: Easy, Average, Hard, and Very Hard. Easy skills cost few points to purchase levels in, and the cost per skill level increases with each level of difficulty.  Game mechanics allow that eventually it may be less expensive to raise the level of the base attribute the skills depend on as opposed to purchasing higher levels of skills.  A player can generally purchase a skill for his character at any level he or she can afford.  The lower you choose the fewer points it costs to buy the skill, and the higher you go, the more points it costs. Some skills have default levels, which indicate the level rating a character has when using that skill untrained (i.e. not purchased). For example, a character with a Dexterity of 12, is using the Climbing skill untrained. Climbing has a default of DX-5 or ST-5, which means that using the skill untrained gives him a Climbing skill level of 7 (12-5) if he tied it to the Dexterity stat. If the character had a higher Strength stat, he could have a better chance of success if he tied the Climbing skill there instead.\n\nSome skills also have a Tech Level (TL) rating attached to them, to differentiate between Skills that concern similar concepts, but whose tasks are accomplished in different ways when used with differing levels of technology. This helps during time traveling scenarios, or when characters are forced to deal with particularly outdated or advanced equipment. For instance, a modern boat builder's skills will be of less use if he is stuck on a desert island and forced to work with primitive tools and techniques. Thus, the skills he uses are different when in his shop (Shipbuilding/TL8) and when he is on the island (Shipbuilding/TL0).\n\n===Success rolls===\n''GURPS'' uses six-sided [[dice]] for all game mechanics using [[dice notation|standard dice notation]]. An \"average roll\" of three six sided dice generates a total of 10.5; this makes an \"average\" skill check (a skill of 10, based on an unmodified attribute) equally likely to succeed or fail.\n\nMaking statistic and skill checks in ''GURPS'' is the reverse of the mechanics of most other RPGs, where the higher the total of the die roll, the better. ''GURPS'' players hope to roll as low as possible under the tested statistic's rating or skill's level. If the roll is less than or equal to that number, the check succeeds. There is no \"target number\" or \"difficulty rating\" set by the Game Master, as would be the case in many other RPG systems. Instead the GM will apply various modifiers to add or subtract to the skill level. In this way, positive modifiers increase the chance for success by adding to the stat or skill level you must roll under while negative modifiers deduct from it, making things more difficult.\n\nFor example: a player makes a pick pocketing test for her character. The character has a Pickpocket skill with a level of 11. Under normal circumstances - i.e., under an ''average stressful situation'', according to the manual - the player must roll an 11 or less for the character to succeed. If the player rolls above 11, then the character has failed the attempt at pick pocketing.\n\nThere are some exceptions for very high or low rolls, deemed [[Critical hit|criticals]]. No matter the level of the skill, a die roll of 18 is always a ''critical failure'', and a roll of 3 or 4 is always a critical success (a roll of 17 is a critical failure as well, unless the character relevant skill level is 16 or more). The Game Master may decide in such cases that, in first case (a roll of 18, or 10+ over the modified skill level), the character has failed miserably and caused something disastrous to happen or, in the other case, that he or she succeeds incredibly well and gains some benefit as a result.\n\n===Combat===\nCombat in ''GURPS'' is organized in personal turns: i.e., every character gets a turn each [[second]], and during his or her character's turn he or she may take an action, such as attack or move. After all characters have taken their action, one second has elapsed. Free actions are simple actions that can be done at any time. Characters in a party have a set initiative that is entirely based upon their Basic Speed characteristic.<ref name=\"rpgnet3\">{{cite web  | last = Chu-Carroll  | first = Mark | authorlink =   | title = GURPS Fourth Edition Characters Review   | work = website  | publisher = RPGNet.com  | date = 2004-11-17  | url = http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10646.phtml | type = review  | doi =   | accessdate = 2008-12-08}}</ref>\n\nThere are two kinds of attacks: Melee (possibly with hand-to-hand weapons, or unarmed combat) and Ranged (bows, guns, thrown weapons, some Innate Attacks, etc.). Attacks made by a character are checked against their skill with the particular weapon they carry. For instance, if a character is using a pistol, as with any other skill, it is beneficial to have a high level in the [[Gun]]s skill. Like any other skill check, a player must roll equal to or less than the level of the skill to succeed. Failure means a miss, success scores a hit. Similarly, critical hits mean that the blow might inflict significantly more damage to its target; critical misses may lead to a rather unpleasant and unexpected event (such as dropping the weapon or hitting the wrong target). Attack modifiers are set by the GM when factoring in things like distance, speed and cover that make a successful strike more difficult.\n\nAfter a successful attack, except in the case of a critical hit, the defender usually gets a chance to avoid the blow.  This is called an Active Defense, and takes the form of a Dodge (deliberate movement out of the perceived path of the attack), Parry (attempt to deflect or intercept the attack with a limb or weapon), or Block (effort to interpose a shield or similar object between the attack and the defender's body).  Unlike many RPG systems, an Active Defense is an unopposed check, meaning that in most cases, the success of an attack has no effect on the difficulty of the defense.  Dodge is based on the Basic Speed characteristic, while Parry and Block are each based on individual combat skills, such as Fencing, Karate, or Staff for Parry, and Shield or Cloak for Block. A common criticism is that characters can achieve a relatively high Active Defense value, drawing out fights considerably. The only mechanic within the system to address this is the Feint action, which if successful will place the adversary in an unfavorable position, reducing their active defense against that character only, on the subsequent turn.\n\nCertain skills, attributes and equipment, when strung together, can be used to great effect. Let us say a gunslinger from the Old West is facing a foe; he can use the Combat Reflexes ability to react before his enemy, the Fast-Draw(Pistol) skill to get his two guns out, the Gunslinger ability to allow him to skip the aiming step, and the Dual-Weapon Attack(Pistol) skill to fire both his guns at once. This would have taken around 6 turns, if he had none of these skills.\n\n===Damage and defenses===\nDamage from muscle-powered weapons, (clubs, swords, bows, etc.) is calculated based on the character's ST rating. The weaker a character is physically, the less damage he or she is capable of inflicting with such a weapon. Purely mechanical weapons (guns, beam sabers, bombs, etc.) have a set damage value.\n\nWhen damage is inflicted upon characters, it is deducted from their [[Hit point|Hit Points]], which are calculated with the Strength stat (prior to ''GURPS'' 4th Edition, Hit Points were derived from the Health stat). Like most other RPGs, a loss of hit points indicates physical harm being inflicted upon a character, which can potentially lead to death. ''GURPS'' calculates shock penalties when someone is hit, representing the impact it causes and the rush of pain that interferes with concentration. Different weapons can cause different 'types' of damage, ranging from crushing (a club or mace), impaling (a spear or arrow), cutting (most swords and axes), piercing (bullets), and so on.\n\nOne peculiarity about loss of Hit Points is that in GURPS, death is not certain. While a very high amount of total HP loss will cause certain death, there are also several points at which a player must successfully roll HT, with different grades of failure indicating character death or a mortal injury.\n\nDepending on the nature of the attack, there will sometimes be additional effects.\n\n===Advancement===\nCharacter advancement follows the same system as character creation. Characters are awarded character points to improve themselves at regular intervals (usually at the end of a game session or story).\n\nGMs are free to distribute experience as they see fit. This contrasts with some traditional RPGs where players receive a predictable amount of experience for defeating foes. The book recommends providing 1-3 points for completing objectives and 1-3 points for good role-playing per game session.\n\nAdvancement can also come through study, work, or other activities, either during game play or between sessions. In general, 200 hours of study equals one character point which can be applied for the area being studied. Self-study and on the job experience take more time per character point while high tech teaching aids can reduce the time required.\n\nSome intensive situations let a character advance quickly, as most waking hours are considered study. For instance, characters travelling through the Amazon may count every waking moment as study of jungle survival, while living in a foreign country could count as eight hours per day of language study or more.\n\n==Licensed works==\nThe computer game publisher [[Interplay Productions|Interplay]] licensed ''GURPS'' as the basis for a post\u2013[[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] [[role-playing video game]] (''[[Fallout (computer game)|Fallout]]'') in 1995.

Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining [[policy]]. Each government has a kind of [[constitution]], a statement of its governing principles and philosophy. Typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual [[freedom]] and the idea of absolute state authority ([[tyranny]]). \n\nWhile all types of organizations have governance, the word ''government'' is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 [[List of sovereign states|independent national governments]] on [[Earth]], as well as subsidiary organizations.<ref name=EncycSocialSciences>{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-08-043076-7}}</ref>\n\nHistorically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, [[aristocracy]], [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]], [[theocracy]] and [[Tyrant|tyranny]].

About 5,000 years ago, the first small city-states appeared.{{sfn|Christian|2004|p=245}} By the third to second millenniums BC, some of these had developed into larger governed areas: [[Sumer]], [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], and the [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|Yellow River Civilization]].{{sfn|Christian|2004|p=294}}\n\nThe development of [[agriculture]] and [[water control]] projects were a catalyst for the development of governments.<ref name=\"brittanica2010\">The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (15th edition)</ref> For many thousands of years when people were [[hunter-gatherer]]s and small scale farmers, humans lived in small, non-hierarchical and [[self-sufficient]] communities.{{cn|date=October 2017}} On occasion a chief of a tribe was elected by various rituals or tests of strength to govern his tribe, sometimes with a group of elder tribesmen as a council. The human ability to precisely communicate abstract, learned information allowed humans to become ever more effective at agriculture,{{sfn|Christian|2004|pp=146\u2013147}} and that allowed for ever increasing population densities.{{sfn|Christian|2004|p=245}} David Christian explains how this resulted in states with laws and governments:<ref name=\"Christian\">{{cite book\n|title=Maps of Time\n|last=Christian\n|first=David\n|date=2004\n|publisher=University of California Press\n|isbn=0-520-24476-1\n|ref=harv\n}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|As farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between different groups increased and the social pressure rose until, in a striking parallel with star formation, new structures suddenly appeared, together with a new level of complexity.

The [[Glorious Revolution]] in England, the [[American Revolution]], and the [[French Revolution]] contributed to the growth of representative forms of government. The [[Soviet Union]] was the first large country to have a [[Communist]] government.<ref name=EncycSocialSciences /> Since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], [[liberal democracy]] has become an even more prevalent form of government.<ref name=\"Kuper\" />\n\nIn the nineteenth and twentieth century, there was a significant increase in the size and scale of government at the national level.<ref>{{cite|isbn=978-0-19-957967-9|title=The Oxford Handbook of State and Local Government|date=2014}}</ref> This included the regulation of [[corporations]] and the development of the [[welfare state]].<ref name=\"Kuper\">{{cite book|title=The Social Science Encyclopedia|editor=Adam Kuper and Jessica Kuper|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-47635-5}}</ref>\n\n==Political science==\n=== Classifying government ===\nIn political science, it has long been a goal to create a typology or taxonomy of [[polities]], as typologies of political systems are not obvious.<ref>Lewellen, Ted C. ''Political Anthropology: An Introduction Third Edition''. Praeger Publishers; 3rd edition (2003)</ref> It is especially important in the [[political science]] fields of [[comparative politics]] and [[international relations]]. Like all categories discerned within forms of government, the boundaries of government classifications are either fluid or ill-defined.\n\nSuperficially, all governments have an official or ideal form. The United States is a [[Federal republic|constitutional republic]], while the former Soviet Union was a [[socialist republic]]. However self-identification is not objective, and as Kopstein and Lichbach argue, defining regimes can be tricky.<ref>''Comparative politics : interests, identities, and institutions in a changing global order'', Jeffrey Kopstein, Mark Lichbach (eds.), 2nd ed, Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0521708400}}, p. 4.</ref> For example, [[election]]s are a defining characteristic of an electoral democracy,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} but in practice elections in the former Soviet Union were not \"free and fair\" and took place in a [[one-party state]]. [[Voltaire]] argued that \"the [[Holy Roman Empire]] is neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire\".<ref>{{cite journal | title=The Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire | journal=Michigan Academician | last1=Renna | first1=Thomas | volume=42 | issue=1 | pages=60\u201375 | url=http://journal.themichiganacademy.org/doi/abs/10.7245/0026-2005-42.1.60?code=msal-site&journalCode=maca | doi=10.7245/0026-2005-42.1.60 | date=Sep 2015 }}</ref> Many governments that officially call themselves a \"[[democratic republic]]\" are not democratic, nor a republic; they are usually a dictatorship ''[[de facto]]''. Communist dictatorships have been especially prone to use this term. For example, the official name of North Vietnam was \"The Democratic Republic of Vietnam\". China uses a variant, \"The People's Republic of China\". Thus in many practical classifications it would not be considered democratic.\n\nIdentifying a form of government is also difficult because many [[political systems]] originate as socio-economic movements and are then carried into governments by [[political party|parties]] naming themselves after those movements; all with competing political-ideologies. Experience with those movements in power, and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government, can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.\n\nOther complications include general non-consensus or deliberate \"distortion or bias\" of reasonable technical definitions to political ideologies and associated forms of governing, due to the nature of politics in the modern era. For example: The meaning of \"[[conservatism]]\" in the [[United States]] has little in common with the way the word's definition is used elsewhere. As Ribuffo notes, \"what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls [[liberalism]] or neoliberalism\".<ref>Leo P. Ribuffo, \"20 Suggestions for Studying the Right now that Studying the Right is Trendy,\" ''Historically Speaking'' Jan 2011 v.12#1 pp. 2\u20136, quote on p. 6</ref> Since the 1950s conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. However, during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] many [[Southern Democrats]] were conservatives, and they played a key role in the [[Conservative Coalition]] that controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963.<ref>Kari Frederickson, ''The Dixiecrat Revolt and the End of the Solid South, 1932\u20131968'', p. 12, \"...conservative southern Democrats viewed warily the potential of New Deal programs to threaten the region's economic dependence on cheap labor while stirring the democratic ambitions of the disfranchised and undermining white supremacy.\", The University of North Carolina Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8078-4910-1}}</ref>\n\n===Social-political ambiguity===\nEvery country in the world is ruled by a system of governance that combines at least three or more political or economic attributes.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Additionally, opinions vary by individuals concerning the types and properties of governments that exist. \"Shades of gray\" are commonplace in any government and its corresponding classification. Even the most liberal democracies limit rival political activity to one extent or another while the most tyrannical dictatorships must organize a broad base of support thereby creating difficulties for \"[[pigeonholing]]\" governments into narrow categories. Examples include the claims of the [[Plutocracy#United States|United States as being a plutocracy]] rather than a democracy since some American voters believe elections are being manipulated by wealthy [[Super PACs]].<ref>[http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594204098,00.html \"Plutocrats \u2013 The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407045309/http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594204098,00.html |date=7 April 2014 }} Chrystia Free land is Global Editor-at-Large at Reuters news agency, following years of service at the ''Financial Times'' both in New York and London.

Plato also assigns a man to each of these regimes to illustrate what they stand for. The tyrannical man would represent tyranny for example. These five regimes progressively degenerate starting with aristocracy at the top and tyranny at the bottom.\n\n==Forms of government==\n{{main list|List of forms of government}}\n\nOne method of classifying governments is through which people have the authority to rule.  This can either be one person (an autocracy, such as monarchy), a select group of people (an aristocracy), or the people as a whole (a democracy, such as a republic).\n\nThe division of governments as monarchy, aristocracy and democracy has been used since Aristotle's [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}  In his book [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] expands on this classification.\n\n{{quote|The difference of Commonwealths consisteth in the difference of the sovereign, or the person representative of all and every one of the multitude. And because the sovereignty is either in one man, or in an assembly of more than one; and into that assembly either every man hath right to enter, or not every one, but certain men distinguished from the rest; it is manifest there can be but three kinds of Commonwealth. For the representative must needs be one man, or more; and if more, then it is the assembly of all, or but of a part. When the representative is one man, then is the Commonwealth a monarchy; when an assembly of all that will come together, then it is a democracy, or popular Commonwealth; when an assembly of a part only, then it is called an aristocracy. Other kind of Commonwealth there can be none: for either one, or more, or all, must have the sovereign power (which I have shown to be indivisible) entire.<ref name=\"Leviathan\">{{cite wikisource|author=Hobbes, Thomas|title=Leviathan|wslink=Leviathan/The Second Part}}</ref>}}\n\n===Autocracy===\nAn autocracy is a system of government in which supreme [[Power (social and political)|power]] is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] or mass [[insurrection]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/autocracy |title=Autocracy: A Glossary of Political Economy Terms|author=Paul M. Johnson |publisher=Auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}</ref>\n\nA [[despotism]] is a government ruled by a single entity with absolute power, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for implicit threat). That entity may be an individual, as in an [[autocracy]], or it may be a group, as in an [[oligarchy]]. The word despotism means to \"rule in the fashion of despots\".{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\nA [[monarchy]] is where a family or group of families (rarely another type of group), called the [[wikt:Special:Search/royalty|royalty]], represents national identity, with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals, called the monarch, who mostly rule kingdoms. The actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical ([[crowned republic]]) to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]) to completely despotic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally and in most cases, the post of the monarch is [[inheritance|inherited]], but there are also [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] where the monarch is elected.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Aristocracy===\nAristocracy ([[Greek language|Greek]] \u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 ''aristokrat\u00eda'', from  \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ''[[Wikt:aristocrat#English|aristos]]'' \"excellent\", and \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ''[[Wikt:kratos|kratos]]'' \"[[Power (social and political)|power]]\") is a form of government that places power in the hands of a small, privileged [[ruling class]].<ref name=OED>{{cite journal|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=December 1989 |title=Aristocracy |trans_title= |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50011987?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=aristocracy&first=1&max_to_show=10 |accessdate=December 22, 2009 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629022358/http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50011987?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=aristocracy&first=1&max_to_show=10 |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nMany [[Monarchy|monarchies]] were aristocracies, although in modern constitutional monarchies the monarch himself or herself has little real power. The term \"Aristocracy\" could also refer to the non-peasant, non-servant, and non-city classes in the [[Feudalism|Feudal system]].    \n\nAn oligarchy is ruled by a small group of segregated, powerful or influential people who usually share similar interests or family relations. These people may spread power and elect candidates equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or monarchic. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several rulers.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\nSome historical examples of oligarchy are the former [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republic]]s. Some critics of [[representative democracy]] think of [[Oligarchy#United States|the United States as an oligarchy]]. The [[Athenian democracy]] used [[sortition]] to elect candidates, almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of land, wealth and status.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\nA [[theocracy]] is rule by a religious elite; a system of governance composed of religious institutions in which the state and the church are traditionally or [[constitution]]ally the same entity.  [[Holy See|The Vatican]]'s (see [[Pope]]), [[Iran]]'s (see [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]), [[Central Tibetan Administration|Tibetan government]]'s (see [[Dalai Lama]]), [[Caliphate]]s and other [[Islamic state]]s are historically considered ''theocracies''.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Democracy===\nIn a general sense, in a [[democracy]], all the people of a [[state (polity)|state]] or [[polity]] are involved in making decisions about its affairs. Also refer to the rule by a government chosen by election where most of the populace are enfranchised. The key distinction between a democracy and other forms of constitutional government is usually taken to be that the right to vote is not limited by a person's wealth or race (the main qualification for enfranchisement is usually having reached a certain age). A democratic government is, therefore, one supported (at least at the time of the election) by a [[majority]] of the populace (provided the election was held fairly). A \"majority\" may be defined in different ways. There are many \"power-sharing\" (usually in countries where people mainly identify themselves by race or religion) or \"electoral-college\" or \"constituency\" systems where the government is not chosen by a simple one-vote-per-person headcount.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nIn democracies, large proportions of the population may vote, either to make decisions or to choose representatives to make decisions. Commonly significant in democracies are political parties, which are groups of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[Liberal democracy]] is a variant of democracy. It is a [[form of government]] in which [[representative democracy]] operates under the principles of [[liberalism]]. It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive [[election]]s between [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|multiple distinct]] [[Political party|political parties]], a [[separation of powers]] into different [[branches of government]], the [[rule of law]] in everyday life as part of an [[open society]], and the protection of [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]] for all persons. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [[constitution]], either formally written or [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]], to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [[social contract]]. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [[republic]], such as [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], or the [[United States]]; or a [[constitutional monarchy]], such as [[Japan]], [[Spain]], or the [[United Kingdom]]. It may have a [[presidential system]] ([[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], or the [[United States]]), a [[semi-presidential system]] ([[France]], [[Portugal]], or [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]), or a [[parliamentary system]] ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[India]], [[Italy]], New Zealand, or the [[United Kingdom]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n=== Republics ===\nA republic is a form of government in which the country is considered a \"public matter\" (Latin: ''res publica''), not the private concern or property of the rulers, and where offices of states are subsequently directly or indirectly elected or appointed rather than inherited.  The people, or some significant portion of them, have supreme control over the government and where offices of state are elected or chosen by elected people.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[[Montesquieu]], ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748), Bk. II, ch. 1.</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Republic|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> A common simplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is not a monarch.<ref name=\"WordNet\">{{Cite journal |title=republic |journal=WordNet 3.0 |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=20 March 2009 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/republic}}</ref><ref name=\"M-W\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Republic|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/republic|accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref> [[Montesquieu]] included both [[democracy|democracies]], where all the people have a share in rule, and [[aristocracy|aristocracies]] or [[oligarchy|oligarchies]], where only some of the people rule, as republican forms of government.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Montesquieu, ''Spirit of the Laws'', Bk. II, ch. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\n\nOther terms used to describe different republics include [[Democratic republic]], [[Parliamentary republic]], [[Federal republic]], and [[Islamic Republic]].\n\n== Scope of government ==\nRule by [[authoritarian]] governments is identified in societies where a specific set of people possess the authority of the state in a [[republic]] or union. It is a [[political system]] controlled by unelected rulers who usually permit some degree of [[individual freedom]]. Rule by a [[totalitarian]] government is characterised by a highly centralised and coercive authority that regulates nearly every aspect of public and private life.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nIn contrast, a constitutional republic is rule by a government whose powers are limited by law or a formal constitution, and chosen by a vote amongst at least some sections of the populace (Ancient Sparta was in its own terms a republic, though most inhabitants were disenfranchised). Republics that exclude sections of the populace from participation will typically claim to represent all citizens (by defining people without the vote as \"non-citizens\"). Examples include the [[United States]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], etc. {{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\n=== Federalism ===\n{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}\nFederalism is a political concept in which a ''group'' of members are bound together by covenant (Latin: ''foedus'', [[wikt:covenant|covenant]]) with a governing [[federal headship|representative head]]. The term \"federalism\" is also used to describe a system of government in which [[sovereignty]] is [[constitution]]ally divided between a central governing authority and constituent political units (such as states or provinces).

Peaking at No. 1 on both the ''Billboard'' 200 and Top Country Albums charts, ''Double Live'' went on to become the best-selling live album of all time, certified  [[RIAA certification|21\u00d7 Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], and is the seventh-most shipped album in United States music history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-100-albums |title=RIAA List of Best Selling Albums |publisher=Riaa.com |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Brooks also released the first installment of ''[[The Limited Series (1998 album)|The Limited Series]]'', a six-disc box set containing reissues of his first six studio albums.

In October 1999, the film's pre-release soundtrack, ''[[Garth Brooks in ... The Life of Chris Gaines]]'' (also dubbed Gaines' ''Greatest Hits''), was released to much public criticism. Brooks also appeared as Gaines in a television [[mockumentary]] for the [[VH1]] series ''[[Behind the Music]]'', and as the musical guest on an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which he also hosted as himself.\n\nBrooks' promotion of the album and the film did not garner excitement, and the failure of the Gaines project was evident mere weeks after the album was released.

{{IPA-fr|\u025bf\u025bl}}; 15 December 1832{{spaced ndash}}27 December 1923) was a French [[civil engineer]]. A graduate of [[\u00c9cole Centrale Paris]], he made his name building various bridges for the French railway network, most famously the [[Garabit viaduct]]. He is best known for the world-famous [[Eiffel Tower]], built for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Universal Exposition]] in Paris, and his contribution to building the [[Statue of Liberty]] in New York. After his retirement from engineering, Eiffel focused on research into [[meteorology]] and [[aerodynamics]], making significant contributions in both fields.\n\n==Early life==\nGustave Eiffel was born in [[Burgundy]], [[France]], in the [[Communes of France|city]] of [[Dijon]], [[C\u00f4te-d'Or]], the first child of Catherine-M\u00e9lanie (n\u00e9e Moneuse) and Alexandre B\u00f6nickhausen ({{IPA-fr|b\u0254nikoz\u0251\u0303}}).<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The Tallest Tower|author=Harriss, J.|date=2004|publisher=Unlimited Pub.|isbn=9781588321046|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vv3dT-kyuu8C|page=25|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref> He was a descendant of Jean-Ren\u00e9 B\u00f6nickhausen, who had emigrated from the [[Germany|German]] town of [[Marmagen]] and settled in Paris at the beginning of the 18th century.<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 21</ref> The family adopted the name Eiffel as a reference to the [[Eifel]] mountains in the region from which they had come. Although the family always used the name Eiffel, Gustave's name was registered at birth as Bonickhausen dit Eiffel,<ref name=\"\u00e9tatcivil\"/>  and was not officially changed to Eiffel until 1880.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>{{cite web | title=Follow the Leader | website=Google Books | date=2016-09-15 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oS8LgSgLHpQC&pg=PA159&dq=eiffel+Bonickhausen&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHkt6my6TPAhXRFsAKHQtpAvcQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=eiffel%20Bonickhausen&f=false | accessdate=2016-09-23}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of Gustave's birth his father, an ex-soldier, was working as an administrator for the [[French Army]]; but shortly after his birth, his mother expanded a charcoal business, and soon afterwards his father gave up his job to assist her. Due to his mother's business commitments, Gustave spent his childhood living with his grandmother, but nevertheless remained close to his mother, who was to remain an influential figure until her death in 1878. His father, however, did not play a big part in young Eiffel's early life. The business was successful enough for Catherine Eiffel to sell it in 1843 and retire on the proceeds.<ref>Harvie 2006, p. 3</ref> Eiffel was not a studious child, and thought his classes at the Lyc\u00e9e Royal in Dijon boring and a waste of time, although in his last two years, influenced by his teachers for history and literature, he began to study seriously, and he gained his [[baccalaur\u00e9at]]s in humanities and science.<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 25</ref>\nAn important part in his education was played by his uncle, Jean-Baptiste Mollerat, who had invented a process for distilling vinegar and had a large chemical works near Dijon, and one of his uncle's friends, the chemist Michel Perret. Both men spent a lot of time with the young Eiffel, teaching him about everything from chemistry and mining to theology and philosophy.\n\nEiffel went on to attend the [[Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe]] in Paris, to prepare for the difficult entrance exams set by engineering colleges in France, and qualified for entry to two of the most prestigious schools \u2013 [[\u00c9cole polytechnique]] and [[\u00c9cole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures]] \u2013 and ultimately entered the latter.<ref>Harvie 2006, p. 7</ref> During his second year he chose to specialize in chemistry, and graduated ranking at 13th place out of 80 candidates in 1855. This is what is thought to be one of the things that led young Eiffel into his career of engineering. This was the year that Paris hosted the second World's Fair, and Eiffel was bought a season ticket by his mother.<ref>Harvie 2006, p. 9</ref>\n\n===Early career===\n[[File:Bordeaux passerelle Eiffel.jpg|thumb|The Bordeaux bridge, Eiffel's first major work.]]\nAfter graduation, Eiffel had hoped to find work in his uncle's workshop in Dijon, but a family dispute made this impossible. After a few months working as an unpaid assistant to his brother-in-law, who managed a [[foundry]], Eiffel approached the railway engineer [[Charles Nepveu]], who gave Eiffel his first paid job as his private secretary.<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 30</ref>  However, shortly afterwards Nepveu's company went bankrupt, but Nepveu found Eiffel a job designing a {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on}} sheet iron bridge for the Saint Germaine railway. Some of Nepveu's businesses were then acquired by the Compagnie Belge de Mat\u00e9riels de Chemin de Fer: Nepveu was appointed the managing director of the two factories in Paris, and offered Eiffel a job as head of the research department. In 1857 Nepveu negotiated a contract to build a railway bridge over the river [[Garonne]] at [[Bordeaux]], connecting the Paris-Bordeaux line to the lines running to [[S\u00e8te]] and [[Bayonne]], which involved the construction of a {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} iron girder bridge supported by six pairs of masonry piers on the river bed. These were constructed with the aid of compressed air [[caisson (engineering)|caissons]] and [[hydraulic rams]], both innovative techniques at the time. Eiffel was initially given the responsibility of assembling the metalwork and eventually took over the management of the entire project from Nepveu, who resigned in March 1860.<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 33</ref>\n\nFollowing the completion of the project on schedule Eiffel was appointed as the principal engineer of the Compagnie Belge. His work had also gained the attention of several people who were later to give him work, including Stanislas de la Roche Toulay, who had prepared the design for the metalwork of the Bordeaux bridge, Jean Baptiste Krantz and Wilhelm Nordling. Further promotion within the company followed, but the business began to decline, and in 1865 Eiffel, seeing no future there, resigned and set up as an independent consulting engineer. He was already working independently on the construction of two railway stations, at [[Toulouse]] and [[Agen]], and in 1866 he was given a contract to oversee the construction of 33 [[locomotive]]s for the [[Egypt]]ian government, a profitable but undemanding job in the course of which he visited Egypt, where he visited the [[Suez Canal]] which was being constructed by [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]. At the same time he was employed by Jean-Baptiste Kranz to assist him in the design of the exhibition hall for the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]] which was to be held in 1867. Eiffel's principal job was to draw up the arch girders of the [[Galerie des Machines]]. In order to carry out this work, Eiffel and Henri Treca, the director of the [[Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers]],<ref>Harvie 2006, p. 37</ref> conducted valuable research on the structural properties of [[cast iron]], definitively establishing the [[modulus of elasticity]] applicable to compound castings.\n\n===Eiffel et Cie===\n[[File:Budapest nyugati trams.jpg|thumb|The Budapest-Nyugati station.]]\nAt the end of 1866 Eiffel managed to borrow enough money to set up his own workshops at 48 Rue Fouquet in [[Levallois-Perret]].<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 37</ref>  His first important commission was for two [[viaduct]]s for the railway line between [[Lyon]] and Bordeaux, and the company also began to undertake work in other countries, including the church of San Marcos in [[Arica]], [[Chile]], which was an all-metal prefabricated building, manufactured in France and shipped to South America in pieces to be assembled on site.\n\nOn 6 October 1868 he entered into partnership with [[Th\u00e9ophile Seyrig]], like Eiffel a graduate of the \u00c9cole Centrale, forming the company Eiffel et Cie (\"Eiffel and Company\").\nIn 1875, Eiffel et Cie were given two important contracts, one for a new [[railway station#Terminus|terminus]] for the line from [[Vienna]] to [[Budapest]] and the other for a bridge over the river [[Douro]] in Portugal.<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 57</ref>  The station in Budapest was an innovative design. The usual pattern for building a railway terminus was to conceal the metal structure behind an elaborate facade: Eiffel's design for Budapest used the metal structure as the centerpiece of the building, flanked on either side by conventional stone and brick-clad structures housing administrative offices.\n[[File:Ponte Maria Pia - Porto.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Maria Pia Bridge]]]]\nThe bridge over the Douro came about as the result of a competition held by the Royal Portuguese Railroad Company. The task was a demanding one: the river was fast-flowing, up to {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, and had a bed formed of a deep layer of gravel which made the construction of piers on the river bed impossible, and so the bridge had to have a central span of {{convert|160|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This was greater than the longest arch span which had been built at the time.<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 60</ref>\nEiffel's proposal was for a bridge whose deck was supported by five iron piers, with the abutments of the pair on the river bank also bearing a central supporting arch. The price quoted by Eiffel was FF.965,000, far below the nearest competitor and so he was given the job, although since his company was less experienced than his rivals the Portuguese authorities appointed a committee to report on Eiffel et Cie's suitability. The members included Jean-Baptiste Krantz, Henri Dion and L\u00e9on Molinos, both of whom had known Eiffel for a long time: their report was favorable, and Eiffel got the job. On-site work began in January 1876 and was complete by the end of October 1877: the bridge was ceremonially opened by [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal|King Luis I]] and [[Maria Pia of Savoy|Queen Maria Pia]], after whom the bridge was named, on 4 November.\n\nThe [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle in 1878]] firmly established his reputation as one of the leading engineers of the time. As well as exhibiting models and drawings of work undertaken by the company, Eiffel was also responsible for the construction of several of the exhibition buildings.<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 71</ref> One of these, a pavilion for the Paris Gas Company, was Eiffel's first collaboration with [[Stephen Sauvestre]], who was later to become the head of the company's architectural office.\n\nIn 1879 the partnership with Seyrig was dissolved, and the company was renamed the '''Compagnie des \u00c9tablissements Eiffel.'''<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 42</ref>\nThe same year the company was given the contract for the [[Garabit viaduct]], a railway bridge near [[Ruynes en Margeride]] in the [[Cantal]] d\u00e9partement. Like the Douro bridge, the project involved a lengthy viaduct crossing the river valley as well as the river itself, and Eiffel was given the job without any process of competitive tendering due to his success with the bridge over the Douro.<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 77</ref>  To assist him in the work he took on several people who were to play important roles in the design and construction of the Eiffel Tower, including [[Maurice Koechlin]], a young graduate of the [[ETH Zurich|Zurich Polytechnikum]], who was engaged to undertake calculations and make drawings, and [[\u00c9mile Nouguier]], who had previously worked for Eiffel on the construction of the Douro bridge.\n\n[[File:RahmenStatue1885.jpg|thumb|Interior structural elements of the Statue of Liberty designed by Gustave Eiffel.]]\nThe same year Eiffel started work on a system of standardised prefabricated bridges, an idea that was the result of a conversation with the governor of [[French Cochinchina|Cochin-China]]. These used a small number of standard components, all small enough to be readily transportable in areas with poor or non-existent roads, and were joined together using [[Screw|bolt]]s rather than [[rivet]]s, reducing the need for skilled labour on site. A number of different types were produced, ranging from footbridges to standard-gauge railway bridges.<ref>Loyrette 1985, pp. 42\u201347</ref>\n\nIn 1881 Eiffel was contacted by [[Auguste Bartholdi]] who was in need of an engineer to help him to realise the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Some work had already been carried out by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-Le-Duc]], but he had died in 1879. Eiffel was selected because of his experience with wind stresses. Eiffel devised a structure consisting of a four-legged pylon to support the copper sheeting which made up the body of the statue. The entire statue was erected at the Eiffel works in Paris before being dismantled and shipped to the United States.<ref>Harvie 2006, p. 70</ref>\n\nIn 1886 Eiffel also designed the dome for the [[Observatoire de Nice|Astronomical Observatory]] in Nice. This was the most important building in a complex designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], later among the most prominent critics of the Tower. The dome, with a diameter of {{convert|22.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, was the largest in the world when built and used an ingenious bearing device: rather than running on wheels or rollers, it was supported by a ring-shaped hollow girder floating in a circular trough containing a solution of [[magnesium chloride]] in water. This had been patented by Eiffel in 1881.\n\n====The Eiffel Tower====\n{{main|Eiffel Tower}}\n[[Image:Maurice koechlin pylone.jpg|thumb|Koechlin's first drawing for the Eiffel Tower. Note the sketched stack of buildings, with Notre Dame at the bottom, indicating the scale of the proposed tower.]]\nThe design of the Eiffel Tower was originated by Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier, who had discussed ideas for a centrepiece for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Exposition Universelle]]. In May 1884 Koechlin, working at his home, made an outline drawing of their scheme, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal [[truss]]es at regular intervals\".<ref>Harvie 2006, p. 78</ref>  Initially Eiffel showed little enthusiasm, although he did sanction further study of the project, and the two engineers then asked [[Stephen Sauvestre]] to add architectural embellishments. Sauvestre added the decorative arches to the base, a glass pavilion to the first level and the [[cupola]] at the top. The enhanced idea gained Eiffel's support for the project, and he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out. The design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884, and on 30 March 1885 Eiffel read a paper on the project to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Ing\u00e9nieurs Civils. After discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying that the tower would symbolise<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 116</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=not only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.}}\n\nLittle happened until the beginning of 1886, but with the re-election of [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]] as President and his appointment of [[Edouard Lockroy]] as Minister for Trade decisions began to be made. A budget for the Exposition was passed and on 1 May Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition which was being held for a centerpiece for the exposition, which effectively made the choice of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion: all entries had to include a study for a {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} four-sided metal tower on the [[Champ de Mars]]. On 12 May a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals and on 12 June it presented its decision, which was that only Eiffel's proposal met their requirements. After some debate about the exact site for the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, and granted him one and a half million francs toward the construction costs. This was less than a quarter of the estimated cost of six and a half million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation during the exhibition and for the following twenty years.<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 121</ref> Eiffel later established a separate company to manage the tower.\n\nThe tower had been a subject of some controversy, attracting criticism both from those who did not believe it feasible and from those who objected on artistic grounds. Just as work began at the Champ de Mars, the \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] and including some of the most important figures of the French arts establishment, including [[Adolphe Bouguereau]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Charles Gounod]] and [[Jules Massenet]]: a petition was sent to [[Jean-Charles Alphand]], the Minister of Works, and was published by ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]''.<ref>Harvie 2006, p. 95</ref> \n\n{{quote|text=To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]], the [[Tour de Saint-Jacques]], the [[Louvre]], the Dome of [[les Invalides]], the [[Arc de Triomphe]], all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream. And for twenty years ... we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal}}\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Construction tour eiffel.JPG|18 July 1887\nImage:Construction tour eiffel2.JPG|7 December 1887\nImage:Construction tour eiffel3.JPG|20 March 1888\nImage:Construction tour eiffel4.JPG|15 May 1888\nImage:Construction tour eiffel5.JPG|21 August 1888\nImage:Construction tour eiffel6.JPG|26 December 1888\nImage:Construction tour eiffel8.JPG|March 1889\n</gallery>\n\n[[Image:Caricature Gustave Eiffel.png|thumb|right|Caricature of Eiffel, published in 1887 at the time of \"The Artist's Protest\"]]\nWork on the foundations started on 28 January 1887. Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, each leg resting on four {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg but the other two, being closer to the river [[Seine]] were more complicated: each slab needed two [[deep foundation|piles]] installed by using compressed-air caissons {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter driven to a depth of {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on}}<ref>Loyrette 1985 p. 123</ref> to support the concrete slabs, which were {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick. Each of these slabs supported a [[limestone]] block, each with an inclined top to bear the supporting shoe for the ironwork. These shoes were anchored by bolts 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in) in diameter and {{convert|7.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.\nWork on the foundations was complete by 30 June and the erection of the iron work was started. Although no more than 250 men were employed on the site, a prodigious amount of exacting preparatory work was entailed: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detail drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 148</ref> The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the positions of rivet holes were specified to within 0.1&nbsp;mm (0.04&nbsp;in) and angles worked out to one [[arcsecond|second of arc]]. The components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, were first bolted together, the bolts being replaced by rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit it was sent back to the factory for alteration. The four legs, each at an angle of 54\u00b0 to the ground, were initially constructed as cantilevers, relying on the anchoring bolts in the masonry foundation blocks. Eiffel had calculated that this would be satisfactory until they approached halfway to the first level: accordingly work was stopped for the purpose of erecting a wooden supporting [[scaffold]]. This gave ammunition to his critics, and lurid headlines including \"Eiffel Suicide!\" and \"Gustave Eiffel has gone mad: he has been confined in an Asylum\" appeared in the popular press.<ref>Harvie 206, p. 110</ref> At this stage a small \"creeper\" [[crane (machine)|crane]] was installed in each leg, designed to move up the tower as construction progressed and making use of the guides for the [[elevator]]s which were to be fitted in each leg. After this brief pause erection of the metalwork continued, and the critical operation of linking the four legs was successfully completed by March 1888. In order to precisely align the legs so that the connecting girders could be put into place, a provision had been made to enable precise adjustments by placing [[Jack (device)#Hydraulic jack|hydraulic jack]]s in the footings for each of the girders making up the legs.\n\nThe main structural work was completed at the end of March, and on the 31st Eiffel celebrated this by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower. Since the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, Eiffel frequently stopping to make explanations of various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including Nouguier, Compagnon, the President of the City Council and reporters from ''[[Le Figaro]]'' and ''[[Le Monde Illustr\u00e9]]''  completed the climb. At 2.35 Eiffel hoisted a large [[Flag of France|tricolour]], to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired from the lower level.<ref>Harvie 2006 pp. 122\u201323</ref>\n\nBy June construction had reached the second level platform, and on [[Bastille Day]] this was used for a fireworks display, and Eiffel held a celebratory banquet for the press on the first level platform.\n\n====The Panama Scandal====\n[[File:Eiffel-lock.png|thumb|Illustration of Eiffel's lock design from a contemporary magazine]]\nIn 1887, Eiffel became involved with the French effort to construct a [[Panama Canal|canal]] across the Panama Isthmus. The French Panama Canal Company, headed by [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], had been attempting to build a sea-level canal, but came to the realization that this was impractical. The plan was changed to one using [[lock (water transport)|locks]], which Eiffel was contracted to design and build. The locks were on a large scale, most having a change of level of {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>Loyrette 1985, p. 193</ref> Eiffel had been working on the project for little more than a year when the company suspended payments of interest on 14 December 1888,<ref>{{cite journal | date =15 December 1888|title=The Panama Canal Company |journal=The Times|issue= 32570|page=7 }}</ref> and shortly afterwards was put into [[liquidation]]. Eiffel's reputation was badly damaged when he was implicated in the financial and political scandal which followed. Although he was simply a contractor, he was charged along with the directors of the project with raising money under false pretenses and misappropriation of funds. On 9 February 1893 Eiffel was found guilty on the charge of misuse of funds, and was fined 20,000 francs and sentenced to two years in prison,<ref>{{cite journal | date =10 February 1893 |title=Heavy Sentences On The Panama Defendants|journal=The Times|issue= 33871|page=5 }}</ref> although he was acquitted on appeal.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060102020147/http://www.tour-eiffel.fr/teiffel/uk/documentation/dossiers/page/gustave_eiffel.html Gustave Eiffel].

Felix-Max Richard had just lost a lawsuit against him by his brother to enforce a noncompetition agreement. Felix-Max Richard appealed the decision but felt he needed a back-up plan if his appeal was denied. On May 28, 1895, the court denied the appeal and Gustave Eiffel bought the Comptoir with three other men: Joseph Vallot, Alfred Besnier, and Leon Gaumont, who was thirty years his junior.<ref>Corcy, Malthete, Mannoni, & Meusy, Les Premieres annees de la societe L. Gaumont et Cie, Correspondance commercial de Leon Gaumont 1895-1899.</ref> The company was renamed L. Gaumont et Cie after its youngest partner because Eiffel did not want his name on the company. Leon Gaumont was manager and Eiffel was president from 1895 through 1906. The company went public in January 1907 and is one of the oldest motion picture companies in the world.\n\nDuring those years, Eiffel guided the company, contributed to its capital investments and inventions, and was absorbed by the new technologies and decisions the company made in its first eleven years. In 1897, he collaborated with Louis-Paul Cailletet and Leon Gaumont on a motion picture camera that was installed in a hot-air balloon. According to the correspondence between Gaumont and Eiffel, Eiffel had dark rooms at his Beauleau-Sur-Mer and Vevey vacation homes where he experimented with chemical developers. He patented a photographic heliograph in 1907.<ref>Couperie-Eiffel, Philippe, Eiffel by Eiffel, 2013</ref><ref>Dietrick, Janelle, Alice & Eiffel, A New History of Early Cinema and the Love Story Kept Secret for a Century, 2016</ref>\n\nHe went on to do important work in [[meteorology]] and [[aerodynamics]].<ref name=\"flightglobal1924\">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1924/1924%20-%200004.html \"The Death of a Great Pioneer: Gustav Eiffel Passes Away\"]. ''[[Flight International]]''. 3 January 1924</ref>  Eiffel's interest in these areas was a consequence of the problems he had encountered with the effects of wind forces on the structures he had built.\n\nHis first aerodynamic experiments, an investigation of the air resistance of surfaces, was carried out by dropping the surface to be investigated together with a measuring apparatus down a vertical cable stretched between the second level of the Eiffel Tower and the ground. Using this Eiffel definitely established that the air resistance of a body was very closely related to the square of the airspeed. He then built a laboratory on the Champ de Mars at the foot of the tower in 1905, building his first [[wind tunnel]] there in 1909. The wind tunnel was used to investigate the characteristics of the [[airfoil]] sections used by the early pioneers of aviation such as the [[Wright Brothers]], [[Gabriel Voisin]] and [[Louis Bl\u00e9riot]]. Eiffel established that the lift produced by an airfoil was the result of a reduction of air pressure above the wing rather than an increase of pressure acting on the under surface. Following complaints about noise from people living nearby, he moved his experiments to a new establishment at [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy|Auteuil]] in 1912. Here it was possible to build a larger wind tunnel, and Eiffel began to make tests using scale models of aircraft designs.<ref>Granet, Andr\u00e9.

Laboratories Eiffel.</ref>\nIn 1913 Eiffel was awarded the [[Langley Gold Medal|Samuel P. Langley Medal for Aerodromics]] by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. In his speech at the presentation of the medal, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] said:<ref>Harvie 2006, p. 207</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=... his writings upon the resistance of the air have already become classical. His researches, published in 1907 and 1911, on the resistance of the air in connection with aviation, are especially valuable. They have given engineers the data for designing and constructing flying machines upon sound, scientific principles}}\n\nEiffel had meteorological measuring equipment placed on the tower in 1889, and also built a weather station at his house in [[S\u00e8vres]]. Between 1891 and 1892 he compiled a complete set of meteorological readings, and later extended his record-taking to include measurements from 25 different locations across France.\n<!-- (chunk to have a home found for it) and suggested that the military install radio equipment atop the tower. In the following years it continued to serve as a permanent radio tower, and eventually for television broadcasting.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051217075256/http://www.tour-eiffel.fr/teiffel/uk/documentation/dossiers/page/gustave_eiffel.html \"Gustave Eiffel\"]. tour-eiffel.fr.</ref> -->\n\nEiffel died on 27 December 1923, while listening to [[Beethoven's 5th Symphony]], Second movement ''Andante'', in his mansion on [[Rue Rabelais]] in Paris, France. He was buried in the family tomb in [[Levallois-Perret Cemetery]].\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:EdwardMoran-UnveilingTheStatueofLiberty1886Large.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Edward Moran]]'s 1886 painting, ''The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World'', depicts the unveiling of the [[Statue of Liberty]].]]\nGustave Eiffel's career was facilitated by the [[Industrial Revolution]]. For a variety of economic and political reasons, this had been slow to make an impact in France,<ref>{{cite book|first=L.T.C.|last=Rolt|authorlink= L.T.C. Rolt|title=Victorian Engineering|publisher=Pelican|year=1974|location=London|isbn=  |page=169}}</ref> and Eiffel had the good fortune to be working at a time of rapid industrial development in France. Eiffel's importance as an engineer was twofold. Firstly he was ready to adopt innovative techniques first used by others, such as his use of compressed-air caissons and hollow cast-iron piers, and secondly he was a pioneer in his insistence on basing all engineering decisions on thorough calculation of the forces involved, combining this analytical approach with an insistence on a high standard of accuracy in drawing and manufacture.\n\nThe growth of the railway network had an immense effect on people's lives, but although the enormous number of bridges and other work undertaken by Eiffel were an important part of this, the two works that did most to make him famous are the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower, both projects of immense symbolic importance and today internationally recognized landmarks. The Tower is also important because of its role in establishing the aesthetic potential of structures whose appearance is largely dictated by practical considerations.\n\nHis contribution to the science of aerodynamics is probably of equal importance to his work as an engineer.<ref name=\"flightglobal1924\"/>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Buildings and structures===\n[[File:Catedral de tacna.JPG|thumb|right|Cathedral of [[San Pedro de Tacna]], [[Peru]].]]\n[[Image:Grand Hotel Traian31.jpg|right|thumb|The \"Grand Hotel Traian\" from [[Ia\u015fi]], is Gustave Eiffel's link to [[Romania]]]]\n[[File:Konak Pier (2).jpg|thumb|right|[[Konak Pier]] in [[\u0130zmir]], Turkey, designed by Gustave Eiffel]]\n*Railway station at [[Toulouse]], France (1862)\n*Railway station at [[Agen]], France.\n*Church of Notre Dame des Champs, Paris (1867)\n* Performing Artes Center L\u00eda Berm\u00fadez, Maracaibo, Venezuela (1886)\n*Synagogue in Rue de Pasarelles, Paris (1867)\n*[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre les Folies]], Paris (1868)\n*Gasworks, [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]] (1873)\n*Gasworks, [[Tacna]], [[Peru]] (1873)\n*[[St. Mark's Cathedral, Arica|Church of San Marcos]], [[Arica, Chile]] (1875)\n*[[Tacna Cathedral|Cathedral]] of [[San Pedro de Tacna]], [[Peru]] (1875)\n*[[Lyc\u00e9e Carnot]], Paris (1876)\n*[[Budapest-Nyugati railway station|Budapest-Nyugati P\u00e1lyaudvar]] (Western railway station), [[Budapest]], Hungary (1877)\n*Ornamental Fountain of the Three Graces, [[Moquegua]], [[Peru]] (1877)\n*Ruhnu Lighthouse at [[Ruhnu]] island, [[Estonia]] (1877)\n*Grand Hotel Traian, [[Ia\u0219i]], [[Romania]] (1882)\n*[[Nice Observatory]], [[Nice]], France (1886)\n*[[Statue of Liberty]], [[Liberty Island]], [[New York City]], United States (1886)\n*[[Colbert Bridge]], Dieppe, France (1888)\n*[[Eiffel Tower]], Paris, France (1889)\n*[[Paradis Latin]] theatre, Paris, France (1889)\n*[[Casa de Fierro]], [[Iquitos]], [[Peru]] (1892)\n*[[Estaci\u00f3n Central (railway station)]], [[Santiago, Chile]], (1897)\n*[[Iglesia de Santa B\u00e1rbara (Santa Rosal\u00eda)|Iglesia de Santa B\u00e1rbara]] in [[Santa Rosal\u00eda, Baja California Sur|Santa Rosal\u00eda]], [[Baja California Sur]], [[Mexico]] (1897)\n* lighthouse on Dzharylhach island, Kherson region, Ukraine (1902)\n*A\u00e9rodynamique EIFFEL (wind tunnel), Paris (Auteuil), France (1911)\n*The Market, [[Olh\u00e3o]], Portugal\n*Palacio de Hierro, [[Orizaba]], [[Veracruz]], Mexico\n*Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda, [[Chiclayo]], [[Peru]] (late 20th century)\n*Condominio Acero, [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], M\u00e9xico\n*Combier Distillery, [[Saumur]] (Loire Valley), France\n[[File:Terminal de Autobuses (4).JPG|right|thumb| [[La Paz]] Bus Station]]\n*[[Estacion de Trenes de La Paz|La Paz Train Station]], [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]] (now La Paz Bus Station)\n*Church in [[Coquimbo, Chile]]\n*F\u00e9nix Theatre, [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]]\n*San Camilo Market, [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]]\n*Farol de S\u00e3o Thom\u00e9, [[Campos dos Goytacazes|Campos]], Brazil\n*Pabellon de la Rosa [[Piri\u00e1polis]], [[Uruguay]]\n*Mercado Municipal, Manaus, Brazil\n*La Cristalera, old portuary storage, [[El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda]], Spain\n*Clock Tower, Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic\n\n===Bridges and viaducts===\n[[Image:Ponte Eiffel em Caminha.jpg|thumb|Eiffel bridge in [[Caminha]]]]\n[[Image:Eiffel Bridge Ungheni.jpg|thumb|Eiffel Bridge in [[Ungheni]]]]\n[[File:Skenderija bridge, Sarajevo.JPG|thumb|Eiffel Bridge in [[Sarajevo]] 1893, also known as [[Skenderija Bridge]], spans the [[River Miljacka|Miljacka]].]]\n*Railway bridge over the river [[Garonne]], [[Bordeaux]] (1861)\n*Viaduct over the river [[Sioule]] (1867)\n*Viaduct at [[Neuvial]] (1867)\n*Swing bridge at [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]] (1870)\n*''Pont de Ferro'' or ''Pont Eiffel'' in [[Girona]], Spain.

Among the opposers were [[Jim Bohlen]], a veteran who had served in the U.S. Navy, and [[Irving Stowe]] and [[Dorothy Stowe]], who had recently become [[Quaker]]s. As members of the [[Sierra Club Canada]], they were frustrated by the lack of action by the organization.<ref name=\"Michael Brown & John May: The Greenpeace Story\"/> From Irving Stowe, Jim Bohlen learned of a form of [[Nonviolent resistance|passive resistance]], \"bearing witness\", where objectionable activity is protested simply by mere presence.<ref name=\"Michael Brown & John May: The Greenpeace Story\"/> Jim Bohlen's wife Marie came up with the idea to sail to Amchitka, inspired by the anti-nuclear voyages of [[Albert Bigelow]] in 1958. The idea ended up in the press and was linked to The Sierra Club.<ref name=\"Michael Brown & John May: The Greenpeace Story\"/> The Sierra Club did not like this connection and in 1970 The [[Don't Make a Wave Committee]] was established for the protest. Early meetings were held in the Shaughnessy home of [[Robert Hunter (journalist)|Robert Hunter]] and his wife Bobbi Hunter.

When the nuclear tests at Amchitka were over, Greenpeace moved its focus to the French atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing]] at the [[Moruroa|Moruroa Atoll]] in [[French Polynesia]]. The young organization needed help for their protests and were contacted by [[David McTaggart]], a former businessman living in New Zealand. In 1972 the yacht ''Vega'', a {{convert|12.5|m|ft|adj=on}} ketch owned by [[David McTaggart]], was renamed ''Greenpeace III'' and sailed in an anti-nuclear protest into the exclusion zone at Moruroa to attempt to disrupt French nuclear testing. This voyage was sponsored and organized by the New Zealand branch of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].<ref>Making Waves the Greenpeace New Zealand Story by Michael Szabo ISBN</ref> The [[French Navy]] tried to stop the protest in several ways, including assaulting David McTaggart. McTaggart was supposedly beaten to the point that he lost sight in one of his eyes. However, one of McTaggart's crew members photographed the incident and went public.

There are companies willing to make major investments to drive clean energy deployment and the number of companies that are increasing their commitment, betting for renewable energies, is also growing.\n\nBig companies such as Google, Wipro, Sprint and Softbank have prioritized changing the laws and policies that govern the energy system and incentivise investments in advanced energy efficiency technologies and renewable energy that will have a critical impact in many countries to determine a meaningful break in energy policies.\n\nIn the Leaderboard we can find one main ranking with the overall scores and another three rankings for each one of the evaluated areas where we can find the top companies contributing in each.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2013/Cool-IT-V6/CoolIT_2013.pdf|title = Cool IT Leaderboard, v6|date =2013-04-06|accessdate = 2015-11-18|publisher = Greenpeace}}</ref>\n\n===Ozone Layer and Greenfreeze===\nThe Ozone layers surrounding the Earth absorb significant amounts of ultraviolet radiation.

To ensure the transparency of the ranking the companies are assessed based only on their public information. For proving companies' policies and practices, Greenpeace uses chemical testing of products, reports from industry observers, media reports and testing of consumer programs to check if they match with their actions. Since the Guide was released in 2006, along with other similar campaigns has driven numerous improvements, when companies ranked eliminate toxic chemicals from their products and improve their recycling schemes. The last published edition of Guide to Greener Electronics was in 2017.

Greenpeace purchased the ''Rainbow Warrior'' (originally launched as the ''Sir William Hardy'' in 1955) at a cost of \u00a340,000. Volunteers restored and refitted it over a period of four months. First deployed to disrupt the hunt of the [[Iceland]]ic whaling fleet, the ''Rainbow Warrior'' would quickly become a mainstay of Greenpeace campaigns. Between 1978 and 1985, crew members also engaged in direct action against the ocean-dumping of toxic and radioactive waste, the [[grey seal]] hunt in [[Orkney]] and nuclear testing in the Pacific. In May 1985, the vessel was instrumental for 'Operation Exodus', the evacuation of about 300 [[Rongelap Atoll]] islanders whose home had been contaminated with nuclear fallout from a US nuclear test two decades earlier which had never been cleaned up and was still having severe health effects on the locals.<ref name=\"GREEN\">\"[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/history/mejato.htm \"The evacuation of Rongelap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213074238/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/history/mejato.htm |date=13 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\nLater in 1985 the ''Rainbow Warrior'' was to lead a flotilla of protest vessels into the waters surrounding [[Moruroa]] atoll, site of French nuclear testing. The [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|sinking of the ''Rainbow Warrior'']] occurred when the [[French government]] secretly bombed the ship in [[Auckland]] harbour on orders from [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] himself.

T. Darling to study parasitic infection, especially blackwater fever, both as a cause of anemia and lesions found in the gastrointestinal tracts of infected patients.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen Whipple first joined the Johns Hopkins University as an assistant, he worked under [[William H. Welch]], focusing on the repair and regeneration of [[Hepatocyte|liver cells]].<ref name=\":0\" /> His research in dogs demonstrated that liver cells had an almost unlimited ability to regenerate.<ref name=\":0\" /> Through his chloroform liver injury studies, Whipple demonstrated that the liver was the site of [[fibrinogen]] synthesis.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhile at the Johns Hopkins University, along with collaborator C. W. Hooper, Whipple studied [[jaundice]] and its association with chloroform poisoning and injury to the liver.<ref name=\":0\" /> His research elucidated the route by which bile pigments enter circulation and produce jaundice in various parts of the body.<ref name=\":0\" /> He also demonstrated that the lympathic system contributed minimally to bile pigment transport.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLater, he and Hooper studied [[bile pigments]] and their production outside the liver by way of bile fistulas at the Hooper Foundation at UC San Francisco.<ref name=\":0\" /> His interests soon extended to understanding the production of hemoglobin to gain a better understand of how it is metabolized into bile pigments.<ref name=\":0\" /> Co-authored with Hooper, Whipple published 12 papers, from 1915\u20131917, reporting the following:<ref name=\":2\" />\n* Bile pigment bilirubin was a breakdown product of muscle hemoglobin, though red blood cell [[hemoglobin]] was the major normal source. \n* Bile pigment was not reabsorbed and reused in the production of new red blood cells. \n* The heme moiety of hemoglobin could be converted to bilirubin in both the pleural and peritoneal cavities, in addition to the liver.\n* Normal liver function was essential for the excretion of bilirubin.\n* The curve of red blood cell regeneration in anemia, as influenced by dietary factors, like sugar, amino acids and starvation.\nAt the University of Rochester, Whipple's research focus became studying the various factors in diets which contributed to recovery of long term anemia, particularly in anemic dogs.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Along with his research assistant, [[Frieda Robscheit-Robbins]] (formally Frieda Robbins), they co-authored 21 publications, from 1925\u20131930, reporting the following:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n* Circulating plasma and hemoglobin volumes.\n* The effects of dietary and other factors on [[bile]] salt production and secretion.\n* Measurements of blood [[fibrinogen]].\n* The effects of diet, [[Bleeding|hemorrhage]], liver injury, and other factors on plasma fibrinogen levels.\n* Blood regeneration following simple anemia.\nWhipple and Robscheit-Robbins were regarded as having one of the \"great creative partnerships in medicine\".<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn his landmark studies, published as a series \"Blood Regeneration in Severe Anemia\" beginning in 1925, he demonstrated that raw liver fed to anemic dogs was the most effective diet additive for reversing the anemia by boosting the production of red blood cells.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> He would go on to show that foods derived from animal tissue, and cooked apricots also had a positive effect of increasing red blood cells during anemia.<ref name=\":2\" /> Based on these data, Whipple associated the iron content in these dietary factors to the potency of red blood cell regeneration.<ref name=\":2\" /> This data led directly to successful liver treatment of [[pernicious anemia]] by [[George Minot|George R. Minot]] and [[William P. Murphy]],<ref name=\":6\" /> despite the main therapeutic mechanism being through B12 rather than iron.<ref name=\":5\" /> This was a remarkable discovery since previously, pernicious anemia was invariably fatal at a young age.<ref name=\":6\" /> For his contribution to this body of work, he was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1934 along with Minot and Murphy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1935, with F S. Daft and Robscheit-Robbins, he would demonstrate hemoglobin production in the fasting state was increased with a sugar fed diet.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1937, Whipple collaborated with William B. Hawkins to determine the life-span of the red blood cell in dogs.<ref name=\":2\" /> Simultaneously, with the advent of radioactive iron, Whipple, Paul F. Hahn, and William F. Bale collaborated to study iron absorption and utilization.<ref name=\":2\" /> They demonstrated that iron absorption was highly regulated in the small intestine and was influenced by the amount of iron stores in the body.<ref name=\":2\" /> They also demonstrated that insignificant amounts of iron were normally excreted or lost in the urine, feces, or bile.<ref name=\":2\" /> During this time, Whipple also formulated his theory on \"the dynamic equilibrium between blood and tissue proteins\" based on earlier plasmapheresis experiments he had performed (in the early 1930s) which demonstrated the importance of dietary protein on production of plasma proteins.<ref name=\":2\" /> This formed the foundation of research into mammalian protein metabolism, and led [[Rudolph Schoenheimer|Rudolf Schoenheimer]] to write ''The Dynamic State of the Body Constituents,'' marking the modern era of biochemistry and biology.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBetween 1939 and 1943 Leon L. Miller and Whipple collaborated to study the hepato-toxic effects of chloroform anesthesia on dogs.<ref name=\":2\" /> They found that dogs in a protein depleted state sustained lethal liver injury from within anesthesia fifteen minutes; but that feeding these depleted dogs a protein rich meal, particularly rich in L-methionine or L-cystine, prior to anesthesia was protective.<ref name=\":2\" /> This and other studies, led Whipple to the conclusion that S-containing amino acids are protective against liver against toxic agents.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nDuring World War II, Whipple tested combinations of dietary amino acids, administered, orally or parenterally, and their effects on plasma protein synthesis.<ref name=\":2\" /> He was able to characterize [[amino acid]] mixtures that could satisfy the metabolic requirements necessary to maintain weight, nitrogen balance, and plasma protein and hemoglobin regeneration in the dog.<ref name=\":2\" /> This would ultimately led to human clinical trials which demonstrated that these amino acid mixtures, along with enzymatic digest of casein, could sustain nourishment in patients who could not intake nutrients through the normal gastrointestinal route for extended periods.<ref name=\":2\" /> This cocktail of nutritional supplementation is routinely used today.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBetween 1943 and 1955, using radiolabeled lysine, Whipple studied plasma protein and hemoglobin production further.<ref name=\":2\" /> Important conclusions from this body of work included:<ref name=\":2\" />\n* Additional evidence of the relationship and dynamic equalibrium between stored and circulating plasma proteins.\n* The time frame of synthesis and release of labeled hemoglobin in dog circulation was 3\u20135 days.\n* The immediate circulation of intraperitoneally injected isotopically labeled red blood cells and plasma proteins in dogs\nOver the course of his career, Whipple published more than 300 publications.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bdNOHfIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao]</ref>\n\n== Nobel Prize, honors and distinctions ==\nWhipple shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1934 with George R.

Both in specialized and in ordinary language, guilt is an affective state in which one experiences conflict at having done something that one believes one should not have done (or conversely, having not done something one believes one should have done). It gives rise to a feeling which does not go away easily, driven by '[[conscience]]'. [[Sigmund Freud]] described this as the result of a struggle between the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and the [[superego]]&nbsp;\u2013 parental imprinting. Freud rejected the role of [[God]] as punisher in times of illness or rewarder in time of wellness. While removing one source of guilt from patients, he described another. This was the unconscious force within the individual that contributed to illness, Freud in fact coming to consider \"the obstacle of an unconscious sense of guilt...as the most powerful of all obstacles to recovery.\"<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) pp. 390\u20131</ref> For his later explicator, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], guilt was the inevitable companion of the signifying subject who acknowledged normality in the form of [[the Symbolic]] order.<ref>[[Catherine Belsey]], ''Shakespeare in Theory and Practice'' (2008) p. 25</ref>\n\n[[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] claims that \"many people suffer all their lives from this oppressive feeling of guilt, the sense of not having lived up to their parents' expectations....no argument can overcome these guilt feelings, for they have their beginnings in life's earliest period, and from that they derive their intensity.\"<ref>Alice Miller, ''The Drama of Being a Child'' (1995) pp. 99\u2013100</ref> This may be linked to what Les Parrott has called \"the disease of false guilt....At the root of false guilt is the idea that what you ''feel'' must be true.\"<ref>Parrott, pp. 158\u20139</ref> If you ''feel'' guilty, you must ''be'' guilty!\n\nThe philosopher [[Martin Buber]] underlined the difference between the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] notion of guilt, based on internal conflicts, and ''existential guilt'', based on actual harm done to others.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buber, M. |title=Guilt and guilt feelings |journal=Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=114\u201329 |date=May 1957 |pmid=13441838}}</ref>\n\nGuilt is often associated with [[anxiety]].

In this way, he reduces the chances of retaliation by members of his tribe, and thereby increases his survival prospects, and those of the tribe or group. As with any other emotion, guilt can be [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] to control or influence others. As highly social animals living in large, relatively stable groups, humans need ways to deal with conflicts and events in which they inadvertently or purposefully harm others. If someone causes harm to another, and then feels guilt and demonstrates regret and sorrow, the person harmed is likely to forgive. Thus, guilt makes it possible to forgive, and helps hold the social group together.\n\n====Social psychology theories====\nWhen we see another person suffering, it can also cause us pain. This constitutes our powerful system of empathy, which leads to our thinking that we should do something to relieve the suffering of others. If we cannot help another, or fail in our efforts, we experience feelings of guilt. From the perspective of group selection, groups that are made up of a high percentage of co-operators outdo groups with a low percentage of co-operators in between-group competition. People who are more prone to high levels of empathy-based guilt may be likely to suffer from anxiety and depression; however, they are also more likely to cooperate and behave altruistically. This suggests that guilt-proneness may not always be beneficial at the level of the individual, or within-group competition, but highly beneficial in between-group competition.{{Citation needed|reason=cf. Dearing, et al. in Addictive Behaviors Vol 30.7 for conflicting research.|date=December 2008}}\n\n====Other theories====\nAnother common notion is that guilt is assigned by social processes, such as a [[jury trial]] (i. e., that it is a strictly legal concept). Thus, the ruling of a jury that [[O. J. Simpson]] or [[Julius Rosenberg]] was \"guilty\" or \"not innocent\" is taken as an actual judgment by the whole society that they must act as if they were so. By corollary, the ruling that such a person is \"not guilty\" may not be so taken, due to the asymmetry in the assumption that one is [[Presumption of innocence|assumed innocent until proven guilty]], and prefers to take the [[risk]] of freeing a guilty party over convicting innocents. Still others\u2014often, but not always, theists of one type or another\u2014believe that the origin of guilt comes from violating universal principles of right and wrong. In most instances, people who believe this also acknowledge that even though there is proper guilt from doing 'wrong' instead of doing 'right', people endure all sorts of guilty feelings which do not stem from violating universal moral principles.\n\n==Collective guilt==\n\n{{main|Collective responsibility}}\nCollective guilt (or group guilt) is the unpleasant and often emotional reaction that results among a group of individuals when it is perceived that the group illegitimately harmed members of another group. It is often the result of \u201csharing a social identity with others whose actions represent a threat to the positivity of that identity.\u201d For an individual to experience collective guilt, he must identify himself as a part of the in-group. \u201cThis produces a perceptual shift from thinking of oneself in terms of \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018me\u2019 to \u2018us\u2019 or \u2018we\u2019.\u201d<ref name=\"Collective\">{{cite book |last=Branscombe |first=Nyla, R. |author2=Bertjan Doosje |year=2004\n|title=Collective Guilt: International Perspectives |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-52083-5}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural views==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}\nTraditional [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]], [[Korean society]] and [[Chinese culture]]<ref>Bill Brugger, ''China, Liberation and Transformation'' (1981) pp. 18\u201319</ref> are sometimes said to be \"[[shame]]-based\" rather than \"guilt-based\", in that the social consequences of \"getting caught\" are seen as more important than the individual feelings or experiences of the agent (see the work of [[Ruth Benedict]]). The same has been said of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek society]], a culture where, in [[Bruno Snell]]'s words, if \"honour is destroyed the moral existence of the loser collapses.\"<ref>Quoted in M. I. Finley, ''The World of Odysseus'' (1967) p. 136</ref>\n\nThis may lead to more of a focus on [[etiquette]] than on [[ethics]] as understood in Western civilization, leading some{{who|date=April 2012}} in Western civilizations to question why the word ''[[ethos]]'' was adapted from [[Ancient Greek]] with such vast differences in cultural norms. [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] inherit most notions of guilt from [[Judaism]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, [[Ancient Persia|Persia]]n, and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ideas, mostly as interpreted through [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who adapted [[Plato]]'s ideas to Christianity. The [[Latin]] word for guilt is ''culpa'', a word sometimes seen in law literature, for instance in ''mea culpa'' meaning \"my fault (guilt)\".\n\n===Etymology===\nGuilt, from [[Old English|O.E.]] ''gylt'' \"crime, sin, fault, fine, debt\", derived from O.E. ''gieldan'' \"to pay for, debt\". The mistaken use for \"sense of guilt\" is first recorded in 1690. \"Guilt by association\" is first recorded in 1941. \"Guilty\" is from O.E. ''gyltig'', from ''gylt''.\n\n===In literature===\nGuilt is a main theme in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', Tennessee Williams' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s \"[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]\" and \"[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]\", and many other works of literature. In Sartre's ''[[The Flies]]'', the Furies (in the form of flies) represent the morbid, strangling forces of neurotic guilt which bind us to authoritarian and totalitarian power.<ref>Robert Fagles trans., ''The Oresteia'' (Penguin 1981) p. 92</ref>\n\nGuilt is a major theme in many works by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and is an almost universal concern of novelists who explore inner [[life]] and [[secret]]s.\n\n===In the Christian Bible===\nGuilt in the Christian [[Bible]] is not merely an emotional state but is a legal state of deserving punishment. The [[Hebrew Bible]] does not have a unique word for guilt, but uses a single word to signify: \"sin, the guilt of it, the punishment due unto it, and a sacrifice for it.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Owen, J. |chapter=Chapter 8|title=The Doctrine of Justification by Faith |publisher=Johnstone and Hunter |location=London |year=1850 |page=197}}</ref> The Greek [[New Testament]] uses a word for guilt that means \"standing exposed to judgment for sin\" (e. g., [[Romans 3]]:19). In what Christians call the \"[[Old Testament]]\", Christians believe the Bible teaches that, through sacrifice, one's sins can be forgiven (Judaism categorically rejects this idea, holding that forgiveness of sin is exclusively through repentance, and the role of sacrifices was for atonement of sins committed by accident or ignorance [http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/11-08-02.html]). The New Testament says that this forgiveness is given as written in 1 Corinthians 15:3\u20134: \"3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, for that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.\" Some believe that the Old and New Testaments have differing opinions on the expiation of guilt because the Old Testaments were subject to the Age of Law and the New Testaments replace the Age of Law with the now current Age of Grace. However, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament salvation was granted based on God's grace and forgiveness (Gen 6:8; 19:19; Exo 33:12\u201317; 34:6\u20137). Animal sacrifices were only a symbol of the future sacrifice of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (Heb 10:1\u20134; 9\u201312). The whole world is guilty before God for abandoning him and his ways (Rom 3:19). In Jesus Christ, God took upon himself the sins of the world and died on the cross to pay our debt (Rom 6:23). Those who repent and accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for their sins, will be redeemed by God and thus not guilty before him. They will be granted eternal life which will take effect when Jesus comes the second time (1 Thess 4:13\u201318). In contrast to surrounding nations which addressed their guilt with human sacrifice, the Israeli authors of the Bible called that an abomination (1 Kings 11:7, Jer 32:35). The Bible agrees with pagan cultures that guilt creates a cost that someone must pay (Heb 9:22). (This assumption was expressed in the previous section, \"Defences\": \"Guilty people punish themselves if they have no opportunity to compensate the transgression that caused them to feel guilty. It was found that self-punishment did not occur if people had an opportunity to compensate the victim of their transgression.\") But unlike pagan deities who demanded it be paid by humans, God, according to the Bible, loved us enough to pay it Himself, as a good father would, while calling us His \"children\" and calling Himself our \"father\" (Mat 5:45).\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Emotional blackmail]]\n*[[Some Character-Types Met with in Psycho-Analytic Work#Criminals from a sense of guilt|Criminals from a sense of guilt]]\n*[[Guilt by association]]\n**[[Collective guilt]]\n***[[German collective guilt]]\n**[[Survivor guilt]]\n**[[White guilt]]\n*[[Guilt culture]]\n**[[Catholic guilt]]\n***[[Mea culpa]]\n**[[Jewish guilt]]\n*[[Guilty pleasure]]\n*[[Guilt trip]]\n*[[Mens rea]]\n*[[Postponement of affect#Guilt|Postponement of guilt]]\n*[[Self-blame]]\n*[[Shame culture]]\n*[[Georges Bataille]]\n*[[Nietzsche]]\n*[[Guiltive]]\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Adam Phillips, 'Guilt', in ''On Flirtation'' (1994) pp.&nbsp;138\u2013147\n* Nina Coltart, 'Sin and the Super-ego', in ''Slouching Towards Bethlehem'' (1992)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Cite journal |author=Tangney, J.

In its purest form, it is a [[brightness|bright]], slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, [[malleable]], and [[ductile]] [[metal]]. Chemically, gold is a [[transition metal]] and a [[group 11 element]]. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]]. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as [[gold nugget|nuggets]] or grains, in [[rock (geology)|rocks]], in [[vein (geology)|veins]], and in [[alluvial deposit]]s. It occurs in a [[solid solution]] series with the native element [[silver]] (as [[electrum]]) and also naturally [[alloy]]ed with [[copper]] and [[palladium]]. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with [[tellurium]] ([[gold telluride]]s).\n\nGold is resistant to most [[acid]]s, though it does dissolve in [[aqua regia]], a mixture of [[nitric acid]] and [[hydrochloric acid]], which forms a soluble [[chloroauric acid|tetrachloroaurate]] [[anion]]. Gold is insoluble in [[nitric acid]], which dissolves silver and [[base metal]]s, a property that has long been used to [[refining (metallurgy)|refine]] gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects, giving rise to the term ''[[acid test (gold)|acid test]]''. Gold also dissolves in [[alkaline]] solutions of [[cyanide]], which are used in [[gold cyanidation|mining]] and [[electroplating]].

Electrum's color runs from golden-silvery to silvery, dependent upon the silver content. The more silver, the lower the [[specific gravity]].\n\nNative gold occurs as very small to microscopic particles embedded in rock, often together with [[quartz]] or [[sulfide mineral]]s such as \"Fool's Gold\", which is a [[pyrite]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arizonagoldprospectors.com/formation.htm |title=Formation of Lode Gold Deposits |publisher=arizonagoldprospectors.com |author=Heike, Brian |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122100747/http://arizonagoldprospectors.com/formation.htm |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> These are called [[lode]] deposits.

Exploitation of gold in the south-east corner of the [[Black Sea]] is said to date from the time of [[Midas]], and this gold was important in the establishment of what is probably the world's earliest coinage in [[Lydia]] around 610 BC.<ref name=lion /> From the 6th or 5th century BC, the [[Chu (state)]] circulated the [[Ying Yuan]], one kind of square gold coin.\n\nIn [[Roman metallurgy]], new methods for extracting gold on a large scale were developed by introducing [[hydraulic mining]] methods, especially in [[Hispania]] from 25 BC onwards and in [[Dacia]] from 106 AD onwards. One of their largest mines was at [[Las Medulas]] in [[Le\u00f3n (province)|Le\u00f3n]], where seven long [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] enabled them to sluice most of a large alluvial deposit. The mines at [[Ro\u015fia Montan\u0103]] in [[Transylvania]] were also very large, and until very recently, still mined by opencast methods. They also exploited smaller deposits in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], such as placer and hard-rock deposits at [[Dolaucothi]]. The various methods they used are well described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[encyclopedia]] ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' written towards the end of the first century AD.\n\nDuring [[Mansa Musa]]'s (ruler of the [[Mali Empire]] from 1312 to 1337) [[hajj]] to [[Mecca]] in 1324, he passed through [[Cairo]] in July 1324, and was reportedly accompanied by a [[camel train]] that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels where he gave away so much gold that it depressed the price in Egypt for over a decade, causing high [[inflation]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060524015912/http://www.blackhistorypages.net/pages/mansamusa.php Mansa Musa].

Although they never succeeded in this attempt, the alchemists did promote an interest in systematically finding out what can be done with substances, and this laid the foundation for today's [[chemistry]]. Their symbol for gold was the [[circled dot|circle with a point at its center]] (\u2609), which was also the [[astrology|astrological]] symbol and the ancient [[Chinese character]] for the [[Sun]].\n\nGolden treasures have been rumored to be found at various locations, following tragedies such as the Jewish temple treasures in the Vatican, following the temple's destruction in 70 AD, a gold stash on the ''[[Titanic]]'', the [[Nazi gold]] train \u2013 following [[World War II]].\n\nThe [[Dome of the Rock]] is covered with an ultra-thin golden glassier. The [[Sikh]] Golden temple, the [[Harmandir Sahib]], is a building covered with gold. Similarly the [[Wat Phra Kaew]] emerald [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[temple]] ([[wat]]) in [[Thailand]] has ornamental gold-leafed statues and roofs. Some European king and queen's [[crown (headgear)|crowns]] were made of gold, and gold was used for the [[bridal crown]] since antiquity. An ancient Talmudic text circa 100 AD describes [[Rachel, wife of Rabbi Akiva]], receiving a \"Jerusalem of Gold\" (diadem).

Winners of athletic events and other graded competitions are usually awarded a gold medal. Many awards such as the [[Nobel Prize]] are made from gold as well. Other award statues and prizes are depicted in gold or are [[gold plated]] (such as the [[Academy Awards]], the [[Golden Globe Awards]], the [[Emmy Awards]], the [[Palme d'Or]], and the [[British Academy Film Awards]]).\n\n[[Aristotle]] in his [[Aristotelian ethics|ethics]] used gold symbolism when referring to what is now known as the [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]. Similarly, gold is associated with perfect or divine principles, such as in the case of the [[golden ratio]] and the [[golden rule]].\n\nGold is further associated with the wisdom of aging and fruition. The fiftieth [[wedding anniversary]] is golden. A person's most valued or most successful latter years are sometimes considered \"golden years\". The height of a civilization is referred to as a [[golden age]].\n\nIn some forms of [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], gold has been associated both with [[sacred|holiness]] and [[evil]]. In the [[Book of Exodus]], the [[Golden Calf]] is a symbol of [[idolatry]], while in the [[Book of Genesis]], [[Abraham]] was said to be rich in gold and [[silver]], and Moses was instructed to cover the [[Mercy Seat]] of [[Ark of the Covenant|the Ark of the Covenant]] with pure gold. In [[Eastern Christianity|Byzantine]] [[icon]]ography the [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] of [[Christ]], [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] and the Christian [[saints]] are often golden.\n\nAccording to [[Christopher Columbus]], those who had something of gold were in possession of something of great value on Earth and a substance to even help souls to paradise.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bernstein |first=Peter L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIYmHiYhDu8C&printsec=frontcover |title=The Power of Gold: The History of an Obsession |date=2004 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-471-43659-1 |page=1}}</ref>\n\n[[Wedding ring]]s have been made of gold.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XQA0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA418&dq=%C2%A0Wedding+rings+have+been+made+of+gold#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0Wedding%20rings%20have%20been%20made%20of%20gold&f=false|title=The Canadian Monthly and National Review|date=1874|language=en}}</ref> It is long lasting and unaffected by the passage of time and may aid in the ring symbolism of eternal vows before God and the perfection the marriage signifies.

The proportion of gold in the alloy is measured by ''[[Fineness#Karat|karat]]'' (k), with 24 karat (24k) being pure gold, and lower karat numbers proportionally less.

In a [[monetary]] system known as the [[gold standard]], a certain [[weight]] of gold was given the name of a unit of currency. For a long period, the United States government set the value of the US dollar so that one [[troy ounce]] was equal to $20.67 ($0.665 per gram), but in 1934 the dollar was devalued to $35.00 per troy ounce ($0.889/g).

Demand in the first quarter of 2014 pushed turnover to $23.7 billion according to a [[World Gold Council]] report.\n\nGold [[solder]] is used for joining the components of gold jewelry by high-temperature hard soldering or [[brazing]]. If the work is to be of [[hallmark]]ing quality, the gold solder alloy must match the [[Fineness#Karat|fineness]] (purity) of the work, and alloy formulas are manufactured to color-match yellow and white gold. Gold solder is usually made in at least three melting-point ranges referred to as Easy, Medium and Hard. By using the hard, high-melting point solder first, followed by solders with progressively lower melting points, goldsmiths can assemble complex items with several separate soldered joints. Gold can also be made into [[gold thread|thread]] and used in [[embroidery]].\n\n=== Electronics ===\nOnly 10% of the world consumption of new gold produced goes to industry,<ref name=\"oil-price.com-worlds-gold-consumption 2011\" /> but by far the most important industrial use for new gold is in fabrication of corrosion-free [[electrical connectors]] in computers and other electrical devices. For example, according to the World Gold Council, a typical cell phone may contain 50&nbsp;mg of gold, worth about 50 cents. But since nearly one billion cell phones are produced each year, a gold value of 50 cents in each phone adds to $500 million in gold from just this application.<ref>[http://www.usfunds.com/slideshows/the-many-uses-of-gold/ Uses of gold] Accessed 4 November 2014</ref>\n\nThough gold is attacked by free chlorine, its good conductivity and general resistance to oxidation and corrosion in other environments (including resistance to non-chlorinated acids) has led to its widespread industrial use in the electronic era as a thin-layer coating on [[electrical connector]]s, thereby ensuring good connection. For example, gold is used in the connectors of the more expensive electronics cables, such as audio, video and [[USB]] cables. The benefit of using gold over other connector metals such as [[tin]] in these applications has been debated; gold connectors are often criticized by audio-visual experts as unnecessary for most consumers and seen as simply a marketing ploy.

All the other isotopes are radioactive. The two longest-lived and only commercially important ones are gallium-67 (half-life 3.261&nbsp;days) and gallium-68 (half-life 67.7&nbsp;min). Isotopes lighter than gallium-69 usually decay through [[beta plus decay]] (positron emission) or [[electron capture]] to isotopes of [[zinc]], although the lightest few (with mass numbers 56 through 59) decay through prompt [[proton emission]]. Isotopes heavier than gallium-71 decay through [[beta minus decay]] (electron emission), possibly with delayed [[neutron emission]], to isotopes of [[germanium]], while gallium-70 can decay through both beta minus decay and electron capture. Gallium-67 is unique among the light isotopes in having only electron capture as a decay mode, as its decay energy is not sufficient to allow positron emission.<ref name=\"Audi\">{{cite journal | last = Audi | first = Georges | title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties | journal = Nuclear Physics A | volume = 729 | issue = 1 | pages = 3\u2013128 | date = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 | bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A | last2 = Bersillon | first2 = O. | last3 = Blachot | first3 = J. | last4 = Wapstra | first4 = A.

It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white [[metalloid]] in the [[carbon group]], chemically similar to its group neighbors [[tin]] and [[silicon]]. Pure germanium is a [[semiconductor]] with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with [[oxygen]] in nature.\n\nBecause it seldom appears in high concentration, germanium was discovered comparatively late in the history of chemistry. Germanium ranks near fiftieth [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth's crust]]. In 1869, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|predicted]] its existence and some of its properties from its position on his [[periodic table]], and called the element '''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements#Ekasilicon and germanium|ekasilicon]]'''. Nearly two decades later, in 1886, [[Clemens Winkler]] found the new element along with [[silver]] and [[sulfur]], in a rare mineral called [[argyrodite]]. Although the new element somewhat resembled [[arsenic]] and [[antimony]] in appearance, the combining ratios in compounds agreed with Mendeleev's predictions for a relative of silicon. Winkler named the element after his country, [[German Empire|Germany]]. Today, germanium is mined primarily from [[sphalerite]] (the primary ore of zinc), though germanium is also recovered commercially from [[silver]], [[lead]], and [[copper]] [[ore]]s.\n\nElemental germanium is used as a semiconductor in [[transistor]]s and various other electronic devices. Historically, the first decade of semiconductor electronics was based entirely on germanium. Today, the amount of germanium produced for semiconductor electronics is one fiftieth the amount of ultra-high purity silicon produced for the same. Presently, the major end uses are [[fibre-optic]] systems, [[infrared vision|infrared optics]], [[solar cell]] applications, and [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs). Germanium compounds are also used for [[polymerization]] catalysts and have most recently found use in the production of [[nanowire]]s. This element forms a large number of [[organometallic]] compounds, such as [[tetraethylgermane]], useful in [[organometallic chemistry]].\n\nGermanium is not thought to be an essential element for any living organism. Some complex organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though none have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminum, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral [[toxicity]]. However, synthetic soluble germanium salts are [[nephrotoxic]], and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with [[halogen]]s and [[hydrogen]] are irritants and toxins.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|History of the transistor}}\n<!--[[File:medeleeff by repin.jpg|thumb|Dmitri Mendeleev|alt=An old man with a gray-white beard sitting by the table, holding an old open book in his laps.

Gadolinium is a silvery-white, [[malleable]], and [[ductile]] [[rare earth metal]]. It is found in nature only in oxidized form, and even when separated, it usually has impurities of the other rare earths. Gadolinium was discovered in 1880 by [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac|Jean Charles de Marignac]], who detected its oxide by using spectroscopy. It is named after the mineral [[gadolinite]], one of the minerals in which gadolinium is found, itself named for the chemist [[Johan Gadolin]]. Pure gadolinium was first isolated by the chemist [[Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]] around 1886.\n\nGadolinium possesses unusual [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] properties, to the extent that as little as 1% of gadolinium can significantly improve the workability and resistance to [[oxidation]] at high temperatures of [[iron]], [[chromium]], and related metals. Gadolinium as a metal or a salt absorbs [[neutron]]s and is, therefore, used sometimes for shielding in neutron [[radiography]] and in [[nuclear reactors]].\n\nLike most of the rare earths, gadolinium forms [[trivalent]] ions with fluorescent properties, and salts of gadolinium(III) are used as phosphors in various applications.\n\nThe kinds of gadolinium(III) ions occurring in water-soluble salts are toxic to mammals. However, [[chelate]]d gadolinium(III) compounds are far less toxic because they carry gadolinium(III) through the [[kidney]]s and out of the body before the free ion can be released into the tissues. Because of its [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] properties, solutions of chelated [[organic chemistry|organic]] gadolinium [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]] are used as [[intravenous]]ly administered [[gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent]]s in medical [[magnetic resonance imaging]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Gadolinium-2.jpg|thumb|left|15-px|A sample of gadolinium metal]]\n\n===Physical properties===\nGadolinium is a silvery-white [[malleable]] and [[ductile]] rare earth metal.

However, it [[tarnish]]es quickly in moist air, forming a loosely-adhering [[gadolinium(III) oxide]] (Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>):\n:4 Gd + 3 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,\nwhich [[spall#Corrosion|spalls]] off, exposing more surface to oxidation.\n\nGadolinium is a strong [[reducing agent]], which reduces oxides of several metals into their elements.

All four trihalides are known. All are white, except for the iodide, which is yellow. Most commonly encountered of the halides is [[gadolinium(III) chloride]] (GdCl<sub>3</sub>). The oxide dissolves in acids to give the salts, such as [[gadolinium(III) nitrate]].\n\nGadolinium(III), like most lanthanide ions, forms [[coordination complex|complexes]] with high [[coordination number]]s. This tendency is illustrated by the use of the chelating agent [[DOTA (chelator)|DOTA]], an octa[[Denticity|dentate]] ligand. Salts of [Gd(DOTA)]<sup>\u2212</sup> are useful in [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. A variety of related chelate complexes have been developed, including [[gadodiamide]].\n\nReduced gadolinium compounds are known, especially in the solid state. Gadolinium(II) halides are obtained by heating Gd(III) halides in presence of metallic Gd in [[tantalum]] containers. Gadolinium also form sesquichloride Gd<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>, which can be further reduced to GdCl by annealing at 800&nbsp;\u00b0C. This gadolinium(I) chloride forms platelets with layered graphite-like structure.<ref>{{cite book| page=1128| url=https://books.google.com/?id=U3MWRONWAmMC&pg=PA1128| title =Advanced inorganic chemistry| edition =6th| author= Cotton| publisher= Wiley-India| date = 2007| isbn =978-81-265-1338-3}}</ref>\n\n===Isotopes===\n{{main|Isotopes of gadolinium}}\nNaturally occurring gadolinium is composed of six stable isotopes, <sup>154</sup>Gd, <sup>155</sup>Gd, <sup>156</sup>Gd, <sup>157</sup>Gd, <sup>158</sup>Gd and <sup>160</sup>Gd, and one [[radioisotope]], <sup>152</sup>Gd, with the isotope <sup>158</sup>Gd being the most abundant (24.84% [[natural abundance]]).

All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 75 years. The majority of these have half-lives of less than 25 seconds. Gadolinium isotopes have four metastable [[nuclear isomer|isomers]], with the most stable being <sup>143m</sup>Gd (''t''<sub>1/2</sub> = 110 seconds), <sup>145m</sup>Gd (''t''<sub>1/2</sub> = 85 seconds) and <sup>141m</sup>Gd (''t''<sub>1/2</sub> = 24.5 seconds).\n\nThe isotopes with [[atomic mass]]es lower than the most abundant stable isotope, <sup>158</sup>Gd, primarily decay by [[electron capture]] to isotopes of [[europium]]. At higher atomic masses, the primary [[decay mode]] is [[beta decay]], and the primary products are isotopes of [[terbium]].\n\n==History==\nGadolinium is named from the mineral [[gadolinite]], in turn named for [[Finland|Finnish]] chemist and [[geologist]] [[Johan Gadolin]].<ref name=Greenwood>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref>\nIn 1880, the Swiss [[chemist]] [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac]] observed the spectroscopic lines from gadolinium in samples of [[gadolinite]] (which actually contains relatively little gadolinium, but enough to show a spectrum) and in the separate mineral [[cerite]]. The latter mineral proved to contain far more of the element with the new spectral line. De Marignac eventually separated a mineral oxide from cerite, which he realized was the oxide of this new element. He named the oxide \"[[gadolinium(III) oxide|gadolinia]]\". Because he realized that \"gadolinia\" was the oxide of a new element, he is credited with discovery of gadolinium. The French chemist [[Paul \u00c9mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]] carried out the separation of gadolinium metal from gadolinia in 1886.\n\n==Occurrence==\n[[File:Gadolinitas.jpg|thumb|Gadolinite]]\nGadolinium is a constituent in many minerals such as [[monazite]] and [[bastn\u00e4site]], which are oxides. The metal is too reactive to exist naturally. Paradoxically, as noted above, the mineral [[gadolinite]] actually contains only traces of this element. The abundance in the Earth's crust is about 6.2&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref name=Greenwood/> The main mining areas are in China, the US, Brazil, Sri Lanka, India, and Australia with reserves expected to exceed one million tonnes. World production of pure gadolinium is about 400 tonnes per year. The only known mineral with essential gadolinium, [[lepersonnite-(Gd)]], is very rare.<ref>Deliens, M., and Piret, P., 1982.

The toxicity of free gadolinium ions in animals is due to interference with a number of calcium-ion channel dependent processes. The [[LD50|50% lethal dose]] is about 100\u2013200&nbsp;mg/kg. Toxicities have not been reported following low dose exposure to gadolinium ions. Toxicity studies in rodents, however show that chelation of gadolinium (which also improves its solubility) decreases its toxicity with regard to the free ion by at least a factor of 100 (i.e., the lethal dose for the Gd-chelate increases by 100 times).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Penfield JG, Reilly RF | title = What nephrologists need to know about gadolinium | journal = Nature Clinical Practice.

Therefore, the name addresses neither the re-union nor the union, but the unity of Germany. The Day of German Unity on 3 October has been the German national holiday since 1990, when the reunification was formally completed.\n\nAn alternative choice to commemorate the reunification could have been the day the [[Berlin Wall]] came down: 9 November 1989, which coincided with the anniversary of the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|proclamation of the German Republic]] in 1918, and the defeat of [[Beer Hall Putsch|Hitler's first coup]] in 1923. However, 9 November was also the anniversary of the first large-scale Nazi-led [[pogrom]]s against [[Jew]]s in 1938 (''[[Kristallnacht]]''), so the day was considered inappropriate as a national holiday.<ref>Kosmidou, Eleftheria Rania (2012).

Therefore, 3 October 1990, the day of the formal reunification, was chosen instead and replaced the \"Day of German Unity\" on 17 June, the national holiday of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] from 1954.\n\n==History==\nGermany has historically associated various dates with its nationhood and unity.\n\n===Imperial Germany===\nBefore 1871, in the area where the single state of Germany now exists, different kingdoms and principalities existed. After the [[unification of Germany]], and the Founding of the Empire 1871, there was still no common national holiday. The [[Sedantag]] was, however, celebrated every year on 2 September, recalling [[Battle of Sedan|the decisive victory]] in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] on 2 September 1870.<ref name=\"Schellack\">Fritz Schellack: ''Nationalfeiertage in Deutschland 1871 bis 1945''.

Dissertation, Universit\u00e4t Mainz 1989)</ref>\n\nAfter the founding of the Empire in 1872, there were calls for a national holiday, and there were three suggestions. No decision was made. Until 1873, the Sedantag was moved to 18 January or the day of the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Frankfurt Treaty]] (10 May 1871). The Sedantag would soon also be celebrated at the universities and in many German cities. It never occurred to them to think about \"Empire Parade\" or \"Emperor's Birthday\". Some Culture Ministers of the states, especially in [[Prussia]], decided that the Sedantag would be an official festival in schools. Upon many suggestions, the date of the Emperor's proclamation on 18 January would be established as day of remembrance. Emperor Wilhelm I declined this: \"This was also the day of the first Prussian coronation of the king, which should not fall into the shadow of a united German holiday.\"<ref>[[Karl Erich Born]]: ''Preu\u00dfen im deutschen Kaiserreich 1871\u20131918.

Immediately after the establishment of the holiday in 1933, the Nazis banned trade unions on 2 May 1933 and occupied their buildings as offices for the Nazi Movement. On 1 March 1939, Hitler declared [[November 9 in German history|9 November]] (the day of the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923) as the \"Memorial Day for the movement\" as the national holiday.\n\n===Federal Republic of Germany===\nFrom 1954 to 1990, 17 June was an official holiday in the Federal Republic of Germany to commemorate the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]], even with the name \"Day of the German Unity\".<ref>[http://www.17juni53.de/chronik/5307/juli53_gesetz.jpg www.17juli1953.de \u2013 Law paragraph establishing July 3rd, 1953, as the \"Day of German Unity\" in West Germany.]</ref> Since 1963, it was proclaimed by the President of the Federal Republic as \"National Day of Memorial of the German People\".

The Helsinki Conference was set for 2 October, at which the foreign ministers would be informed of the results of the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two-plus-Four talks]].\n\nAt the beginning of July, the governments of both German states decided on the schedule: elections in the GDR would be held on 14 October, and a common election for the entire country on [[German federal election, 1990|2 December]].\n\nThe decision on the date was finally made on 22 August by the GDR's Minister-President, [[Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re]], at a special session of the Volkskammer, which began at 9 pm. After a heated debate, the President of the Volkskammer, [[Sabine Bergmann-Pohl]], announced the results at 2:30 am on 23 August:\n\n\"The Volkskammer decides on the accession of the GDR to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany according to Article 23 of the Basic Laws effective as of 3 October 1990. In the matter Nr. 201 there have been 363 votes. There were no invalid votes. 294 deputies have voted 'yes.' (Strong applause from CDU/DA, DSU, FDP, partly SPD and the deputies standing up in their seats.) 62 deputies have voted 'no', and 7 people abstained. This is a historic event. Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe that we have not made an easy decision, but today we have acted within our responsibilities of the voting rights of the citizens of the GDR. I thank everybody that this result was made possible by a consensus across party lines.\"\n\n[[Gregor Gysi]], Chairman of the SED-PDS, was visibly moved and made a personal statement: \"Madame President! The Parliament has no more and no less decided on the downfall of the German Democratic Republic as of 3 October 1990\".<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/30851476_wegmarken_einheit4/202398\n|title=Die Nacht, in der der Beitritt beschlossen wurde\n|publisher=Bundestag\n|quote=Sichtlich bewegt tritt Gysi ans Rednerpult, um eine pers\u00f6nliche Erkl\u00e4rung abzugeben: \"Frau Pr\u00e4sidentin!

Instead of 3 October, the National Reunification should be celebrated on the first Sunday of October. This suggestion received a lot of criticism from many sides, amongst them from Federal President [[Horst K\u00f6hler]] as well as the President of the [[Bundestag]], [[Wolfgang Thierse]]. The demand worried a part of the population because of discontent for increased working hours would be seen as a provocation and devaluing the national holiday. In addition, fixing the Unity Day on the first Sunday of October would have meant that it would sometimes fall on 7 October, which happens to have been the national day of East Germany; this date would thus have been seen as commemorating the division of Germany rather than the reunification.

Since January 2018 [[Annalena Baerbock]] and [[Robert Habeck]] have co-led the party. In the [[German federal election, 2017|2017 federal elections]] the Greens came sixth with 8.9% of the votes and 67 out of 709 seats in the [[Bundestag]].\n\n==Former names and variants in the states==\nThe Green Party was initially founded in West Germany as ''Die Gr\u00fcnen'' (the Greens) in January 1980. It rose out of the anti-nuclear energy, environmental, peace, new left, and new social movements of the late 20th century.\n\n''Gr\u00fcne Liste Umweltschutz'' (green list for environmental protection) were the names of some branches in [[Lower Saxony]] and other states in the Federal Republic of Germany. These groups were founded in 1977 and took part in several elections. Most of them merged with The Greens in 1980.\n\nThe [[West Berlin]] state branch of The Greens was founded as ''Alternative Liste'', or precisely, ''Alternative Liste f\u00fcr Demokratie und Umweltschutz'' (AL; alternative list for democracy and environmental protection) in 1978 and became the official West Berlin branch of The Greens in 1980. In 1993 it renamed to Alliance 90/The Greens Berlin after the merger with East Berlin's Greens and Alliance 90.\n\nThe [[Alliance 90/The Greens Hamburg|Hamburg state branch]] of the Green Party was called ''Gr\u00fcn-Alternative Liste Hamburg'' (GAL; green-alternative list) from its foundation in 1982 until 2012. In 1984 it became the official Hamburg branch of The Greens.\n\n==History==\n\n===12\u201313 January 1980: Foundation congress===\nIn the 1970s, [[environmentalist]]s and [[peace activist]]s politically organised amongst thousands of action groups. The political party '''The Greens''' ({{lang-de|Die Gr\u00fcnen}}) was founded January 13, 1980 in [[Karlsruhe]] to give this movement political and parliamentary representation. Opposition to [[pollution]], use of [[nuclear power]], [[NATO]] military action, and certain aspects of [[Industrialisation|industrialised society]] were principal campaign issues. The Greens originated from civil initiatives, [[new social movements]] of the [[protests of 1968]], but also from the [[conservatism|conservative]] spectrum. Important figures in the first years were&nbsp;\u2013 among others&nbsp;\u2013 [[Petra Kelly]], [[Gert Bastian]], {{ill|Lukas Beckmann|de}}, [[Rudolf Bahro]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Antje Vollmer]], [[Joschka Fischer]], [[Herbert Gruhl]], [[August Hau\u00dfleiter]]<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/merchants-of-despair | title=Merchants of Despair: Radical Environmentalists, Criminal Pseudo-Scientists, and the Fatal Cult of Antihumanism | publisher=New Atlantis Books | author=Zubrin, Robert | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-59403-476-3}}</ref>, [[Luise Rinser]], {{ill|Dirk Schneider|de}}, [[Brigitte Heinrich]], {{ill|Rolf Stolz|de}}, and {{ill|Baldur Springmann|de}}.\n\nIt was at this congress, that the Greens lay their ideological foundations, proclaiming the famous [[Four Pillars of the Green Party]]:\n* [[Social justice]]\n* [[Ecological wisdom]]\n* [[Grassroots democracy]]\n* [[Nonviolence]]\n\n===1980s: Parliamentary representation on the federal level===\nIn 1982, the [[conservatism|conservative]] factions of the Greens broke away to form the [[Ecological Democratic Party]] (\u00d6DP). Those who remained in the Green party were more strongly [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and against restrictions on [[immigration]] and [[reproductive rights]], while supporting the legalisation of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use, placing a higher priority on working for [[LGBT rights in Germany|LGBT rights]], and tending to advocate what they described as \"anti-authoritarian\" concepts of education and child-rearing. They also tended to identify more closely with a culture of protest and [[civil disobedience]], frequently clashing with police at demonstrations against [[nuclear weapons]], [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and the construction of a new runway (''Startbahn West'') at [[Frankfurt airport]]. Those who left the party at the time might have felt similarly about some of these issues, but did not identify with the forms of protest that Green party members took part in.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nAfter some success at [[States of Germany|state-level]] elections, the party won 27 seats with 5.7% of the vote in the Bundestag, the lower house of the German [[parliament]], in the [[West German federal election, 1983|1983 federal election]]. Among the important political issues at the time was the deployment of [[Pershing II]] [[Intermediate-range ballistic missile|IRBM]]s and nuclear-tipped [[cruise missiles]] by the U.S. and [[NATO]] on West German soil, generating strong opposition in the general population that found an outlet in mass demonstrations. The newly formed party was able to draw on this popular movement to recruit support. Partly due to the impact of the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986, and to growing awareness of the threat of air pollution and [[acid rain]] to German forests (\"[[Forest dieback|Waldsterben]]\"), the Greens increased their share of the vote to 8.3% in the [[West German federal election, 1987|1987 federal election]]. Around this time, [[Joschka Fischer]] emerged as the unofficial leader of the party, which he remained until resigning all leadership posts following the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 federal election]].\n\nThe Greens were the target of attempts by the East German secret police to enlist the cooperation of members who were willing to align the party with the agenda of the [[German Democratic Republic]]. The party ranks included several politicians who were later discovered to have been [[Stasi]] agents, including [[Bundestag]] representative Dirk Schneider, [[European Parliament]] representative [[Brigitte Heinrich]], and [[Red Army Faction]] defense lawyer [[Klaus Croissant]]. Greens politician and Bundestag representative [[Gert Bastian]] was also a founding member of {{ill|Generals for Peace|de|Generale f\u00fcr den Frieden}}, a pacifist group created and funded by the Stasi, the revelation of which may have contributed to the murder-suicide in which he killed his partner and Greens founder [[Petra Kelly]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hilton |first1=Isabel |title=The Green with a smoking gun |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-green-with-a-smoking-gun-theres-no-mystery-about-who-killed-petra-kelly-and-her-lover-gert-1372660.html |accessdate=4 September 2018 |work=The Independent |date=26 April 1994}}</ref>.

It was only due to a temporary modification of German election law, applying the five-percent \"hurdle\" separately in East and West Germany, that the Greens acquired any parliamentary seats at all. This happened because in the [[new states of Germany]], the Greens, in a joint effort with [[Alliance 90]], a heterogeneous grouping of [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] activists, were able to gain more than 5% of the vote. Some critics attribute this poor performance to the reluctance of the campaign to cater to the prevalent mood of [[nationalism]], instead focusing on subjects such as [[global warming]]. A campaign poster at the time proudly stated, \"Everyone is talking about Germany; we're talking about the weather!\", paraphrasing a popular slogan of [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]], the German national railway. The party also opposed imminent reunification that was in process, instead wanting to initiate debates on ecology and nuclear issues before reunification causing a drop in support in Western Germany.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Carol J.|title=Greens, E.

[[Joschka Fischer]] became [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany]] and [[Foreign Minister of Germany|foreign minister]] in the new government, which had two other Green ministers ([[Andrea Fischer]], later [[Renate K\u00fcnast]], and [[J\u00fcrgen Trittin]]).\nAlmost immediately the party was plunged into a crisis by the question of German participation in the NATO actions in [[Kosovo]]. Numerous anti-war party members resigned their party membership when the first post-war deployment of German troops in a military conflict abroad occurred under a Red-Green government, and the party began to experience a long string of defeats in local and state-level elections. Disappointment with the Green participation in government increased when anti-nuclear power activists realised that shutting down the nation's nuclear power stations would not happen as quickly as they wished, and numerous pro-business SPD members of the federal cabinet opposed the environmentalist agenda of the Greens, calling for tacit compromises.\n\nIn 2001, the party experienced a further crisis as some Green Members of Parliament refused to back the government's plan of sending military personnel to help with the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132014)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]. [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] called a vote of confidence, tying it to his strategy on the war. Four Green MPs and one Social Democrat voted against the government, but Schr\u00f6der was still able to command a majority.\n\nOn the other hand, the Greens achieved a major success as a governing party through the 2000 decision to phase out the use of nuclear energy. [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Minister of Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] J\u00fcrgen Trittin reached an agreement with energy companies on the gradual phasing out of [[List of nuclear reactors#Germany|the country's nineteen nuclear power plants]] and a cessation of civil usage of nuclear power by 2020. This was authorised through the [[Nuclear Exit Law]]. Based on an estimate of 32 years as the normal period of operation for a nuclear power plant, the agreement defines precisely how much energy a power plant is allowed to produce before being shut down. This law has since been overturned.\n\n===2002&ndash;2005: Greens as governing party, second term===\nDespite the crises of the preceding electoral period, in the [[German federal election, 2002|2002 federal election]], the Greens increased their total to 55 seats (in a smaller parliament) and 8.6%. This was partly due to the perception that the internal debate over the war in Afghanistan had been more honest and open than in other parties, and one of the MPs who had voted against the Afghanistan deployment, [[Hans-Christian Str\u00f6bele]], was directly elected to the Bundestag as a district representative for the [[Berlin Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg - Prenzlauer Berg East (electoral constituency)|Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg - Prenzlauer Berg East constituency]] in Berlin, becoming the first Green to ever gain a [[first-past-the-post]] seat in Germany. The Greens benefited from increased inroads among traditionally left-wing demographics which had benefited from Green-initiated legislation in the 1998\u20132002 term, such as environmentalists ([[Renewable Energies Act]]) and LGBT groups ([[Registered Partnership]] Law). Perhaps most important for determining the success of both the Greens and the SPD was the increasing threat of war in Iraq, which was highly unpopular with the German public, and helped gather votes for the parties which had taken a stand against participation in this war. Despite losses for the SPD, the Red-Green coalition government commanded a very slight majority in the Bundestag and was renewed, with [[Joschka Fischer]] as foreign minister, [[Renate K\u00fcnast]] as minister for consumer protection, nutrition and agriculture, and [[J\u00fcrgen Trittin]] as minister for the environment.\n\nOne internal issue in 2002 was the failed attempt to settle a long-standing discussion about the question of whether members of parliament should be allowed to become members of the party executive. Two party conventions declined to change the party statute. The necessary majority of two thirds was missed by a small margin. As a result, former party chairpersons [[Fritz Kuhn]] and [[Claudia Roth]] (who had been elected to parliament that year) were no longer able to continue in their executive function and were replaced by former party secretary general [[Reinhard B\u00fctikofer]] and former Bundestag member [[Angelika Beer]]. The party then held a member referendum on this question in the spring of 2003 which changed the party statute. Now members of parliament may be elected for two of the six seats of the party executive, as long as they are not ministers or caucus leaders. 57% of all party members voted in the member referendum, with 67% voting in favor of the change. The referendum was only the second in the history of Alliance 90/The Greens, the first having been held about the merger of the Greens and Alliance 90. In 2004, after Angelika Beer was elected to the [[European parliament]], Claudia Roth was elected to replace her as party chair.\n\n[[File:Bdk-oldenburg-2005-kuenast.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Federal party convention in Oldenburg; Renate K\u00fcnast speaking (2005)]]\n\nThe only party convention in 2003 was planned for November 2003, but about 20% of the local organisations forced the federal party to hold a special party convention in [[Cottbus]] early to discuss the party position regarding ''[[Agenda 2010]]'', a major reform of the German welfare programmes planned by Chancellor Schr\u00f6der.\n\nThe November 2003 party convention was held in [[Dresden]] and decided the election platform for the 2004 [[European Parliament]] elections. The German Green list for these elections was headed by [[Rebecca Harms]] (then leader of the Green party in Lower Saxony) and [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], previously Member of the European Parliament for [[The Greens (France)|The Greens of France]]. The November 2003 convention is also noteworthy because it was the first convention of a German political party ever to use an [[electronic voting]] system.\n\nThe Greens gained a record 13 of Germany's 99 seats in these elections, mainly due to the perceived competence of Green ministers in the federal government and the unpopularity of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]].\n\nIn early 2005, the Greens were the target of the [[German Visa Affair 2005]], instigated in the media by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU). At the end of April 2005, they celebrated the decommissioning of the [[Obrigheim nuclear power station]]. They also continue to support a bill for an [[Anti-Discrimination Law]] ([[:de: Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz]]) in the [[Bundestag]].\n\nIn May 2005, the only remaining state-level [[red-green coalition]] government lost the vote in the [[North Rhine-Westphalia state election, 2005|North Rhine-Westphalia state election]], leaving only the federal government with participation of the Greens (apart from local governments). In the early [[German federal election, 2005|2005 federal election]] the party incurred very small losses and achieved 8.1% of the vote and 51 seats. However, due to larger losses of the SPD, the previous coalition no longer had a majority in the Bundestag.\n[[File:National Vote map die Gruenen.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Map showing Alliance 90/The Greens vote in each of the German constituencies at the [[German federal election, 2005]]]]\n\n===2005&ndash;present: Greens back in opposition===\n[[File:Bundestag 2009 Buendnisgruene.svg|thumb|250px|right|Map showing Alliance 90/The Greens vote in each of the German constituencies at the [[German federal election, 2009]]]]\nFor almost two years after the federal election in 2005, the Greens were not part of any government at the state or federal level. In June 2007, the Greens in [[Bremen]] entered into a coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) following the [[Bremen state election, 2007|2007 Bremen state election]].\n\nIn April 2008, following the [[Hamburg state election, 2008|2008 Hamburg state election]], the Green-Alternative List (GAL) in [[Hamburg]] entered into a coalition with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the first [[:de:Schwarz-gr\u00fcne Koalition|such]] state-level coalition in Germany. Although the GAL had to agree to the deepening of the [[Elbe]] River, the construction of a new [[coal-fired power station]] and two road projects they had opposed, they also received some significant concessions from the CDU. These included reforming [[state school]]s by increasing the number of [[primary school]] [[educational stage]]s, the restoration of [[tram]]s as [[public transport]]ation in the [[city-state]], and more [[Pedestrian zone|pedestrian-friendly]] real estate development. On 29 November 2010, the coalition collapsed, resulting in [[Hamburg state election, 2011|an election]] that was won by SPD.\n\nFollowing the [[Saarland state election, 2009|Saarland state election]] of August 2009, The Greens held the balance of power after a close election where no two-party coalitions could create a stable [[majority government]]. After negotiations, the Saarland Greens rejected the option of a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] 'red-red-green' coalition with the SPD and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (''Die Linke'') in order to form a [[centre-right]] state government with the CDU and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP), a historical first time that a [[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]] has formed in German politics.\n\nIn June 2010, in the first state election following the victory of the [[CDU/CSU]] and FDP in the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 federal election]], the \"black-yellow\" CDU-FDP coalition in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] under [[J\u00fcrgen R\u00fcttgers]] lost its majority. The Greens and the SPD came one seat short of a governing majority, but after multiple negotiations about coalitions of SPD and Greens with either the FDP or The Left, the SPD and Greens decided to form a [[minority government]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,701274,00.html |title=Krafts Machtplan: Rot-Gr\u00fcn plant Minderheitsregierung in NRW |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2012-06-03}}</ref> which was possible because under the [[constitution of North Rhine-Westphalia]] a plurality of seats is sufficient to elect a [[Minister-President|minister-president]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://recht.nrw.de/lmi/owa/br_text_anzeigen?v_id=2320020927105939563#det364590|title=Gesetze und Verordnungen - Landesrecht NRW|first=Ministerium f\u00fcr Inneres und Kommunales des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, Referat|last=56|work=nrw.de|accessdate=13 October 2016}}</ref>  So a red-green government in a state where it was defeated under [[Peer Steinbr\u00fcck]] in 2005 came into office again on 14 June 2010 with the election of [[Hannelore Kraft]] as minister-president ([[Cabinet Kraft I]]).\n\nThe Greens founded the first international chapter of a German political party in the U.S. on 13 April 2008 at the [[Goethe-Institut]] in Washington D.C. Its main goal is \"to provide a platform for politically active and green-oriented German citizens, in and beyond Washington D.C., to discuss and actively participate in German Green politics.

As an alternative, they promote a shift to [[alternative energy]] and a comprehensive program of [[energy conservation]].\n\nIn 1986, large parts of Germany were covered with [[radioactive contamination]] from the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and Germans went to great lengths to deal with the contamination. Germany's anti-nuclear stance was strengthened. From the mid-1990s onwards, anti-nuclear protests were primarily directed against transports of [[High-level radioactive waste management|radioactive waste]] in [[dry cask storage|\"CASTOR\" containers]].\n\nAfter the Chernobyl disaster, the Greens became more radicalised and resisted compromise on the nuclear issue. During the 1990s, a re-orientation towards a moderate program occurred, with concern about [[global warming]] and [[ozone depletion]] taking a more prominent role. During the federal red-green government (1998\u20132005) many people became disappointed with what they saw as excessive compromise on key Greens policies.\n\nEnergy policy is still the most important cross-cutting issue in climate and economic policies. Implementation of Green Policy would see electricity generation from 100 percent renewable sources as early as 2040. The development of renewable energy and combined heat and power is also a great opportunity for technical and economic innovation. Solar industry and environmental technologies are already a significant part of key industries providing jobs which need to be developed and promoted vigorously. In addition, a priority of green energy policy is increasing the thermal insulation and energy efficiency of homes, the phaseout of all nuclear energy generation with possible high-efficiency gas-fired power plants operational during the transition phase.\n\n===Environment and climate policy===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nThe central idea of green politics is [[sustainable development]]. The concept of environmental protection is the cornerstone of Alliance 90/The Greens policy. In particular, the economic, energy and transport policy claims are in close interaction with environmental considerations. The Greens acknowledge the natural environment as a high priority and animal protection should be enshrined as a national objective in constitutional law. An effective environmental policy would be based on a common environmental code, with the urgent integration of a climate change bill. During the red-green coalition (1998\u20132005) a policy of agricultural change was launched labeled as a paradigm shift in agricultural policy towards a more ecological friendly agriculture, which needs to continue.\n\nClimate change is at the center of all policy considerations. This includes environmental policy and safety and social aspects. The plans of the Alliance 90/The Greens provide a climate change bill laying down binding reductions to greenhouse gas emissions in Germany by 2020 restricting emissions to minus 40 percent compared to 1990.\n\n===Transport===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nA similarly high priority is given to transport policy. The switch from a traveling allowance to a mobility allowance, which is paid regardless of income to all employees, replacing company car privileges. The truck toll will act as a climate protection instrument internalizing the external costs of transport. Railway should be promoted in order to achieve the desired environmental objectives and the comprehensive care of customers. The railway infrastructure is to remain permanently in the public sector, allowing a reduction in expenditure on road construction infrastructure. The Greens want to control privileges on [[kerosene]] and for international flights, introduce an air ticket levy. Restrict speeds nationwide on the highways to 120&nbsp;km/h and country roads to 80&nbsp;km/h. The Greens want to create a market incentive and research program of  \u20ac500 million annually to ensure that by 2020 there are at least two million electric cars on German roads.\n\n===Welfare, health, family and education===\n\nFor many years, the Green Party has advocated against the \"Ehegattensplitting\" policy, under which the incomes of married couples are split for taxation purposes. Furthermore, the Party advocates for a massive increase in spending for places in preschools on the federal level. Investment in education should also be increased on the higher levels: 1 billion Euros more for vocational schools and 200 million Euros more BAf\u00f6G (Bundesausbildungsf\u00f6rderungsgesetz in German, approximately translated to \"the Federal Law for the Advancement of Education\") for adults.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.n24.de/n24/Nachrichten/Politik/d/2778022/gruene-steuerplaene-treffen-die-mittelschicht.html|title=Kritik am Wahlprogramm: Gr\u00fcne Steuerpl\u00e4ne treffen die Mittelschicht - N24.de|newspaper=N24.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-12-16}}</ref>\n\nIn its platform in 2013, the Green Party advocated for a minimum wage of 8.50 Euro per hour, which was implemented on 1 January 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mindest-lohn.org|title=Gesetzlicher Mindestlohn in Deutschland|website=www.mindest-lohn.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}</ref> It continues to press for higher minimum wages.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe Greens want to continue having the age of 67 be the start of retirement,<ref>Pieter Vanhuysse, Achim Goerres, Ageing Populations in Post-Industrial Democracies: Comparative Studies of Policies and Politics, Routledge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EVNB8B2bZIUC&pg=PA94&dq=Green+Party+germany+retirement#v=onepage&q=Green%20Party%20germany%20retirement&f=false 94], 2013</ref> though they want to include some provisions, for example considering partial retirement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nWhen it comes to drug usage, the Greens want to decriminalize marijuana usage and allow for private growing of plants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gruene.de/themen/soziale-gerechtigkeit/drogenpolitik.html|title=Drogenpolitik - B\u00dcNDNIS 90/DIE GR\u00dcNEN BUNDESPARTEI|date=2016-09-23|website=www.gruene.de|access-date=2016-12-16}}</ref> Furthermore, the Greens support research on the drug and the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Women and LGBT rights===\nThe Green Party supports the implementation of quotas in executive boards, the policy of equal pay for equal work, and continuing the fight against domestic violence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gruene.de/themen/frauenpolitik/frauenpolitik.html|title=Frauenpolitik - B\u00dcNDNIS 90/DIE GR\u00dcNEN BUNDESPARTEI|date=2015-10-01|website=www.gruene.de|access-date=2016-12-16}}</ref> According to its website, the Green Party \"fights for the acceptance and against the exclusion of homosexuals, bisexuals, transsexuals, intersexuals, and transgender people\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gruene.de/themen/soziale-gerechtigkeit/lesben-schwule-sexuelle-identitaet.html|title=Lesben, Schwule & sexuelle Identit\u00e4t - B\u00dcNDNIS 90/DIE GR\u00dcNEN BUNDESPARTEI|date=2013-01-01|website=www.gruene.de|access-date=2016-12-16}}</ref>\n\nIn order to recognize the political persecution that [[LGBT]]+ people face abroad, the Green Party wants to extend asylum to LGBT people abroad.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/queerspiegel/forderung-der-gruenen-asylschutz-fuer-lesben-schwule-und-transgender-ausbauen/13965054.html|title=\"Asylschutz f\u00fcr Lesben, Schwule und Transgender ausbauen\"|access-date=2016-12-16}}</ref> The policy change was sponsored primarily by Volker Beck, one of the Party's most prominent gay members.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/schwule-und-lesbische-abgeordnete-politik-unterm-regenbogen/12721820.html|title=Politik unterm Regenbogen|access-date=2016-12-16}}</ref> Because of the extensive support the Green Party has given the LGBT community since its conception, many gays and lesbians vote for the Green Party even if their political ideology does not quite align otherwise.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Electorate==\n\nThe Infratest Dimap political research company has suggested the Green voter demographic includes those on higher incomes (e.g. above \u20ac2000/month) and the party's support is less among households with lower incomes. The same [[opinion poll|polling research]] also concluded that the Greens received fewer votes from the unemployed and general working population, with business people favouring the party as well as the [[centre-right]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] Free Democratic Party. According to Infratest Dimap the Greens received more voters from the age group 34\u201342 than any other age group and that the young were generally more supportive of the party than the old.

The cities of [[Bonn]], [[Cologne]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Munich]] have among the highest percentages of Green voters in the country. The smaller towns of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], [[T\u00fcbingen]], [[Konstanz]] and [[Darmstadt]] even have Green mayors. The party has a lower level of support in the states of the former [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany). In 2011, the Greens were represented in the parliament of all German states, which is however not the case anymore (as of October 2018).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Anti-nuclear movement]]\n* [[Green party]]\n* [[Green Party faction (Bundestag)]]\n* [[Green Youth (Germany)]]\n* [[List of German Green Party politicians]]\n* [[List of political parties in Germany]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Kleinert, Hubert (1992):''Aufstieg und Fall der Gr\u00fcnen.

The composer [[Vladimir Cosma]] brought Zamfir with his pan flute to Western European countries for the first time in 1972 as the soloist in Cosma's original music for the movie ''[[The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe|Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire]]''. This was very successful,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and since then, he has been used as soloist in movie soundtracks by composers [[Francis Lai]], [[Ennio Morricone]] and many others. Largely through [[television commercial]]s where he was billed as \"Zamfir, Master of the Pan Flute\", he introduced the folk instrument to a modern audience and revived it from obscurity.\n\nIn 1966, Zamfir was appointed conductor of the \"Cioc\u00eerlia Orchestra\", one of the most prestigious state ensembles of Romania, destined for concert tours abroad. This created the opportunity for composition and arranging. In 1969, he left Cioc\u00eerlia and started his own ''[[taraf (musical band)|taraf]]'' (small band) and in 1970 he had his first longer term contract in Paris. Zamfir discovered the much greater freedom for artistic adventure. His taraf consisted of: Ion Dr\u0103goi (violin), Ion L\u0103ceanu (flutes), Dumitru F\u0103rca\u0219 ([[tarogato]]), Petre Vidrean (double bass) and Tony Iordache ([[cymbalum]]) all number 1 soloists in their country.  This taraf made some excellent recordings (CD Zamfir a Paris).{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He changed the composition of the band soon after: Efta Botoca (violin), Marin Chisar (flutes), Dorin Ciobaru and Pavel Cebzan (clarinet and tarogato), Petre Vidrean (bass) and Pantelimon St\u00eenga (cymbalum). It is said that this change was made to increase the command of Zamfir and have more artistic freedom.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  A turning point was the recording of Zamfir's composition \"Messe pour la Paix\" (Philips).{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  His taraf joined a choir and a symphonic orchestra. This was evidence of the growing ambition.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  While the Philips recordings of that time were rather conservative, Zamfir preached revolution in the concert halls with daring performances.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  Some{{who|date=July 2014}} say that this short period was the highlight of his career. In 1977, he recorded \"The Lonely Shepherd\" with [[James Last]]. Zamfir put himself on the world map and since then his career became highly varied, hovering over classical repertoire, easy listening and [[pop music]].\n\nZamfir's big break in the English-speaking world came when the [[BBC]] religious television programme \"The Light of Experience\" adopted his recording of \"Doina De Jale\", a traditional Romanian funeral song, as its theme. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  Popular demand forced [[Epic Records]] to release the tune as a single in 1976, and it climbed to number four on the UK charts. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  It would prove to be his only UK hit single, but it helped pave the way for a consistent stream of album sales in Britain. His song \"Summer Love\" reached number 9 in South Africa in November 1976.<ref>[http://rock.co.za/files/springbok_top_20_(Z).html Retrieved 11 October 2013]</ref> In 1983, he scored a No. 3 hit on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart with \"Blue Navajo,\" and several of his albums (including 1982's ''Romance'' and 1983's ''Childhood Dreams'') have charted in Canada as well.<ref>https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.6218&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=l5mar6d16v3n4thesedivjds82</ref>\n\nAfter nearly a decade-long absence, Zamfir returned to Canada in January 2006 for a seven-city tour with the [http://www.sonart.ro/eng/artisti/rostrings/index.html Traffic Strings] quintet.

He published in [[English language|English]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[German language|German]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], having belonged to the [[Finland Swedish|Swedish-speaking]] minority of Finland.

The first is [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophical logic]] in the Anglo-American vein. His 1951 books, ''An Essay in Modal Logic'' and ''Deontic Logic'', were landmarks in the postwar rise of formal modal logic and its [[deontic logic|deontic]] version. He was an authority on Wittgenstein, editing his later works. He was the leading figure in the Finnish philosophy of his time, specializing in philosophical logic, [[philosophical analysis]], [[philosophy of action]], [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mind]], and the close study of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].\n\nThe other vein in von Wright's writings is [[morality|moralist]] and [[pessimism|pessimist]]. During the last twenty years of his life, under the influence of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] and the [[Frankfurt School]]'s reflections about modern [[Rationality]], he wrote prolifically. His best known article from this period is entitled ''The Myth of Progress'', and it questions whether our apparent material and technological progress can really be considered \"[[progress (history)|progress]]\".\n\nIn the last year of his life, among his other honorary degrees, he held an [[honorary degree]] at the [[University of Bergen]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Nytt om navn|last=|first=|date=17 January 2002|work=Aftenposten|page=14|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He also was awarded [[Swedish Academy Finland Prize]] in 1968.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n[[Image:Georg Henrik von Wright home 1.jpg|thumb|180px|Von Wright's home on Laivurinkatu street, Helsinki: a commemorative plaque marking his long-term residence in the house was fixed to the outer wall in 2006.]] \n*''The Logical Problem of Induction'', PhD thesis, 31 May 1941<ref>Wright, Georg Henrik von.

Sayers]], the tenth featuring [[Lord Peter Wimsey]], and the third including [[Harriet Vane]].\n\nThe [[university don|dons]] of Harriet Vane's ''[[alma mater]]'', the all-female [[List of fictional Oxford colleges|Shrewsbury College, Oxford]] (based on Sayers' own [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]]<ref>[http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/3606/Dorothy-L-Sayers.html Somerville Stories \u2013 Dorothy L Sayers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005002943/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/3606/Dorothy-L-Sayers.html |date=5 October 2013 }}, Somerville College, [[University of Oxford]], UK.</ref>), have invited her back to attend the annual '[[Gaudy]]' celebrations. However, the mood turns sour when someone begins a series of malicious pranks including [[poison pen letter|poison-pen messages]], obscene [[graffiti]], the destruction of a set of [[proofreading|proofs]] and crafting vile [[effigy|effigies]]. Desperate to avoid a possible murder in college, Harriet eventually asks her old friend Wimsey to investigate.\n\n==Plot==\nHarriet Vane returns with trepidation to [[List of fictional Oxford colleges|Shrewsbury College, Oxford]] to attend the Gaudy dinner. Expecting hostility because of her notoriety, she is surprised to be welcomed warmly by the dons, and rediscovers her old love of the academic life.\n\nSome time later the [[dean (education)|Dean]] of Shrewsbury writes to ask for help. There has been an outbreak of anonymous letters, vandalism and threats, apparently from someone within the college, and a scandal is feared. Harriet, herself a victim of poison-pen letters since her trial, reluctantly agrees to help, and spends much of the next few months in residence at the college, ostensibly to do research on [[Sheridan Le Fanu]] and to assist a don with her book.\n\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - Library2.JPG|thumb|A modern-day view of [[Somerville College, Oxford]], the inspiration for the fictional Shrewsbury College and Sayers' ''[[alma mater]]'']]\nAs she wrestles with the case, trying to narrow down the list of suspects and avert a major scandal, Harriet is forced to examine her ambivalent feelings about love and marriage, along with her attraction to academia as an intellectual (and emotional) refuge. Her personal dilemma becomes entangled with darkly hinted suspicions and prejudices raised by the crimes at the college, which appear to have been committed by a sexually frustrated female don. Harriet is forced to re-examine her relationship with Wimsey in the light of what she has discovered about herself. Wimsey eventually arrives in Oxford to help her, and she gains a new perspective on him from those who know him, including his nephew, an undergraduate at the university.\n\nThe attacks build to a crisis, and the college community of students, dons and servants is almost torn apart by suspicion and fear. There is an attempt to drive a vulnerable student to suicide and a physical assault on Harriet that almost kills her. The perpetrator is finally unmasked by Wimsey as one of the college servants, revealed to be the widow of a disgraced academic at a northern university. Her husband's academic fraud had been exposed by an examiner, destroying his career and driving him to suicide. The examiner has since moved to Shrewsbury College, and the campaign has been the widow's revenge against intellectual women who move outside what she sees as their \"proper\" [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]].\n\nAt the end of the book, Harriet Vane finally accepts Wimsey's proposal of marriage. (Their wedding and honeymoon\u2014interrupted by another murder mystery\u2014are depicted in ''[[Busman's Honeymoon]]''.)\n\n==Principal characters==\n*[[Harriet Vane]], 31 \u2013 protagonist, a mystery writer\n*[[Lord Peter Wimsey]] \u2013 protagonist, an aristocratic amateur detective\n*Letitia Martin \u2013 Dean of Shrewsbury College\n*Helen de Vine \u2013 new Research Fellow at Shrewsbury College\n*Miss Lydgate \u2013 Harriet's former tutor<ref>This character is based on [[Mildred Pope]], Sayers' tutor at Somerville College. {{Cite book|last=Kennedy| first = Elspeth| editor =Jane Chance|chapter=Mildred K.

The narrative is interwoven with a love story and an examination of women's struggles to enlarge their roles and achieve some independence within the social climate of 1930s England, and the novel has been described as \"the first feminist mystery novel\".<ref>{{cite book|title=From Mystery to Manners: A Study of Five Detective Novels by Dorothy L.

Harriet Vane and Saint-George, the undergraduate nephew of Lord Peter, help give variety, and the college setting justifies good intellectual debate. The motive is magnificently orated on by the culprit in a scene that is a striking set-piece. And though the Shrewsbury dons are sometimes hard to distinguish one from another, the College architecture is very good. Note a reference to [[C. P. Snow]]'s ''The Search'', and sound views on counterpoint versus harmony.\"<ref name=\"COFC\">[[Jacques Barzun|Barzun, Jacques]] and Taylor, Wendell Hertig.  ''A Catalogue of Crime''. New York: Harper & Row.  1971, revised and enlarged edition 1989.  {{ISBN|0-06-015796-8}}</ref>\n\n''Gaudy Night'' deals with a number of philosophical themes, such as the right relation between love and independence or between principles and personal loyalties. [[Susan Haack]] has an essay on ''Gaudy Night'' as a [[philosophical novel]].<ref>Haack, Susan (May 2001).

Piscataway, NJ: Rutgers University Press, pp. 244\u2013251. {{ISBN|0-8135-3227-2}}.</ref>\n\n==Women's education==\n\nThe issue of women's right to academic education is central to the book's plot. The lecturers of Shrewsbury College are veterans of the prolonged struggle for academic degrees for women, which Oxford granted only reluctantly; Sayers herself took part in this struggle. The Fellows of the college are surprised and a bit dismayed at the attitude of their students, who take for granted this right for which such a hard struggle had to be fought.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn fact the struggle was not yet completely won. Some of the male senior members of the University were still not happy with women getting degrees; the proportion of women in the University was restricted by statute to no more than 25% (a restriction which was only removed in the 1970s); women were segregated in women's colleges such as Shrewsbury, while the prestigious historic colleges remained exclusively male; women's colleges were starved of funds and run on a shoestring.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\nPublication of such going-ons as happen in the book (poison-pen letters, vandalism, the near-suicide of a student and near-murder of a Fellow) would discredit and severely damage Shrewsbury College in particular and the cause of women's education in general. Therefore, all this must be kept secret \u2013 which rules out any approach to the police or other outside agency.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\nFor most of the book, it is assumed that the perpetrator is mentally deranged and that this is a sufficient motive. But as it turned out, the perpetrator's acts were deliberate and calculated. The perpetrator had two motives. The first was to exact retribution from an individual working at Shrewsbury College who she believed had unjustly harmed her and her family. The second was to damage the college and women's education. If Shrewsbury College could not suppress the mischief, the perpetrator hoped to demonstrate that women were incapable of managing professional organisations and that women's education was a failure.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\n==International background==\n\nA subplot in the book is [[Peter Wimsey]]'s role as an unofficial envoy of the [[British Foreign Ministry]], called upon to help defuse international crises when more conventional diplomats have failed. For much of the book he is in Italy (in Germany in the TV adaptation), dealing with a major crisis which for a time seemed to threaten the outbreak of a new European war (as he tells Bunter). Though not explicitly named, this was clearly the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], and the reference would probably have been clear to readers at the time. The book reflects the mindset at the time of writing, when the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] had not yet come to seem inevitable.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn the frame of the book's plot, Wimsey's diplomatic obligations serve as a plot device to keep him away from Britain, and leave Harriet on her own for most of the book, to try to solve the mystery at Oxford without his help.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe book was adapted for television in 1987 as part of a series starring [[Edward Petherbridge]] as Lord Peter and [[Harriet Walter]] as Harriet Vane. A reference to [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning|Chancellor Br\u00fcning]] dates the adaptation to the 1930-32 period, several years earlier than the novel.\n\nIn 2005, an adaptation of the novel was released on CD by the [[BBC Radio Collection]] to finally complete the run of Wimsey adaptations begun with ''[[Whose Body?]]'' in 1973; the role of Harriet was played by [[Joanna David]], and Wimsey by [[Ian Carmichael]].\n\nIn 2006, a theatrical adaptation was created by Frances Limoncelli and directed by Dorothy Milne at Lifeline Theatre in Chicago.<ref>[http://www.theaterinchicago.com/playdetail.php?playID=1594 ''Gaudy Night'' in Chicago]</ref>\n\nThe plot of ''Gaudy Night'' was adapted to become the two-part ''Out of the Past'' episode (#155 & #156) of the American television mystery series ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' starring [[Dick van Dyke]] as Dr. Mark Sloan. The episode first aired on 11 May 2000.\n\n==See also==\n* {{slink|University of Oxford|Women's education}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{FadedPage|id=20140201|name=Gaudy Night}}\n* [http://www.planetpeschel.com/wp/the-wimsey-annotations/gaudy-night/ Annotations and explanations by Bill Peschel]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140523013301/http://faithanncolburn.wordpress.com/tag/dorothy-l-sayers/ \"Gaudy Night \u2014 More Than a Mystery\", 2013 review by Faith Ann Colburn]\n\n{{Lord Peter Wimsey}}\n\n[[Category:1935 British novels]]\n[[Category:Campus novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Dorothy L.

The recorded originator of 'G' is freedman [[Spurius Carvilius Ruga]], the first Roman to open a fee-paying school, who taught around 230 [[BCE]]. At this time, '[[K]]' had fallen out of favor, and 'C', which had formerly represented both {{IPA|/\u0261/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} before open vowels, had come to express {{IPA|/k/}} in all environments.\n\nRuga's positioning of 'G' shows that [[alphabetic order]] related to the letters' values as [[Greek numerals]] was a concern even in the 3rd century BC. According to some records, the original seventh letter, 'Z', had been purged from the Latin alphabet somewhat earlier in the 3rd century BC by the [[Roman censor]] [[Appius Claudius Caecus|Appius Claudius]], who found it distasteful and foreign.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/zed.html Encyclopaedia Romana]</ref> Sampson (1985) suggests that: \"Evidently the order of the alphabet was felt to be such a concrete thing that a new letter could be added in the middle only if a 'space' was created by the dropping of an old letter.\"<ref>[http://www.evertype.com/standards/wynnyogh/thorn.html Evertype.com]</ref>\n\n[[George Hempl]] (1899) proposes that there never was such a \"space\" in the alphabet and that in fact 'G' was a direct descendant of [[zeta]].  Zeta took shapes like \u228f in some of the [[Old Italic script]]s; the development of the [[Roman square capitals|monumental]] form 'G' from this shape would be exactly parallel to the development of 'C' from [[gamma]].  He suggests that the pronunciation {{IPA|/k/}} &gt; {{IPA|/\u0261/}} was due to contamination from the also similar-looking 'K'.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hempl|first=George|date=1899|title=The Origin of the Latin Letters G and Z|journal=[[Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association]]|volume=30|publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]]|pages=24\u201341|doi=10.2307/282560|jstor=282560}}</ref>\n\nEventually, both [[velar consonant]]s {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} developed [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] [[allophone]]s before front vowels; consequently in today's [[Romance languages]], {{vr|c}} and {{vr|g}} have different sound values depending on context (known as [[hard and soft C]] and [[hard and soft G]]).  Because of [[French orthography|French]] influence, [[English orthography]] shares this feature.\n\n===Typographic variants===\n[[File:LowercaseG.svg|left|thumb|200|[[Allography|Typographic variants]] include a double-storey and single-storey '''g'''.]]\nThe modern [[lowercase]] 'g' has two typographic variants: the single-storey (sometimes ''opentail'') '[[File:Opentail g.svg|8px]]' and the double-storey (sometimes ''looptail'') '[[File:Looptail g.svg|8px]]'. The single-storey form derives from the majuscule (uppercase) form by raising the [[serif]] that distinguishes it from 'c' to the top of the loop, thus closing the loop, and extending the vertical stroke downward and to the left. The double-storey form (<span style=\"font-family:Georgia; font-size:110%;\">g</span>) had developed similarly, except that some ornate forms then extended the tail back to the right, and to the left again, forming a closed [[Bowl (typography)|bowl]] or loop. The initial extension to the left was absorbed into the upper closed bowl. The double-storey version became popular when printing switched to \"[[Roman type]]\" because the tail was effectively shorter, making it possible to put more lines on a page. In the double-storey version, a small top stroke in the upper-right, often terminating in an orb shape, is called an \"ear\".\n\nGenerally, the two forms are complementary, but occasionally the difference has been exploited to provide contrast. In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], opentail {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u0261}}}} has always represented a [[voiced velar plosive]], while {{angle bracket|[[File:Looptail g.svg|8px]]}} was distinguished from {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u0261}}}} and represented a [[voiced velar fricative]] from 1895 to 1900.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Association phon\u00e9tique internationale|date=January 1895|title=v\u0254t syr l alfab\u025b|trans-title=Votes sur l'alphabet|journal=Le Ma\u00eetre Phon\u00e9tique|pages=16\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Association phon\u00e9tique internationale|date=February\u2013March 1900a|title=akt \u0254fisj\u025bl|trans-title=Acte officiel|journal=Le Ma\u00eetre Phon\u00e9tique|page=20}}</ref> In 1948, the Council of the [[International Phonetic Association]] recognized {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0261}}}} and {{angbr|[[File:Looptail g.svg|8px]]}} as typographic equivalents,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Daniel|date=July\u2013December 1948|title=desizj\u0254\u0303 ofisj\u025bl|trans-title=D\u00e9cisions officielles|journal=Le Ma\u00eetre Phon\u00e9tique|issue=90|pages=28\u201330}}</ref> and this decision was reaffirmed in 1993.<ref>{{cite journal|author=International Phonetic Association|year=1993|title=Council actions on revisions of the IPA|journal=[[Journal of the International Phonetic Association]]|volume=23|issue=1|pages=32\u201334|doi=10.1017/S002510030000476X}}</ref> While the 1949 ''Principles of the International Phonetic Association'' recommended the use of {{angbr|[[File:Looptail g.svg|8px]]}} for a velar plosive and {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0261}}}} for an advanced one for languages where it is preferable to distinguish the two, such as Russian,<ref>{{cite book|author=International Phonetic Association|year=1949|title=The Principles of the International Phonetic Association|publisher=Department of Phonetics, [[University College, London]]|at=Supplement to ''Le Ma\u00eetre Phon\u00e9tique'' 91, January\u2013June 1949|postscript=.

Alone, it represents\n* a [[voiced velar plosive]] ({{IPA|/\u0261/}} or \"hard\" {{angbr|g}}), as in ''goose'', ''gargoyle'' and ''game'';\n* a [[voiced palato-alveolar affricate]] ({{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} or \"soft\" {{angbr|g}}), generally before {{angbr|i}} or {{angbr|e}}, as in ''giant'', ''ginger'' and ''geology''; or\n* a [[voiced palato-alveolar sibilant]] ({{IPA|/\u0292/}}) in some words of French origin, such as ''rouge'', ''beige'' and ''genre''.\n\nIn words of Romance origin, {{angbr|g}} is mainly soft before {{angbr|e}} (including the digraphs {{angbr|ae}} and {{angbr|oe}}), {{angbr|i}}, or {{angbr|y}}, and hard otherwise. Soft {{angbr|g}} is also used in many words that came into English '''through''' medieval or modern Romance languages from languages without soft {{angbr|g}} (like Ancient Latin and Greek) (e.g.  ''[[wikt:fragile|fragile]]'' or ''[[logic]]'').\nThere are many English words of non-Romance origin where {{angbr|g}} is hard though followed by {{angbr|e}} or {{angbr|i}} (e.g. ''get'', ''gift''), and a few in which {{angbr|g}} is soft though followed by {{angbr|a}} such as ''[[gaol]]'' or ''[[margarine]]''.\n\nThe double consonant {{angbr|[[Dg (digraph)|gg]]}} has the value {{IPA|/\u0261/}} (hard {{angbr|g}}) as in ''nugget'', with very few exceptions: {{IPA|/\u0261d\u0361\u0292/}} in ''suggest'' and {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} in ''exaggerate'' and ''veggies''.\n\nThe digraph {{angbr|[[Dg (digraph)|dg]]}} has the value {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} (soft {{angbr|g}}), as in ''badger''. Non-digraph {{angbr|dg}} can also occur, in compounds like ''floodgate'' and ''headgear''.\n\nThe digraph {{angbr|[[Ng (digraph)#N|ng]]}} may represent \n* a [[velar nasal]] ({{IPAc-en|\u014b}}) as in ''length'', ''singer''\n* the latter followed by hard {{angbr|g}} ({{IPA|/\u014b\u0261/}}) as in ''jungle'', ''finger'', ''longest''\nNon-digraph {{angbr|ng}} also occurs, with possible values\n* {{IPA|/n\u0261/}} as in ''engulf'', ''ungainly''\n* {{IPA|/nd\u0361\u0292/}} as in ''sponge'', ''angel''\n* {{IPA|/n\u0292/}} as in ''melange''\n\nThe digraph {{angbr|[[Gh (digraph)|gh]]}} (in many cases a replacement for the obsolete letter [[yogh]], which took various values including {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, {{IPA|/\u0263/}}, {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}) may represent \n* {{IPA|/\u0261/}} as in ''ghost'', ''aghast'', ''burgher'', ''spaghetti''\n* {{IPA|/f/}} as in ''cough'', ''laugh'', ''roughage''\n* \u00d8 (no sound) as in ''through'', ''neighbor'', ''night'' \n* {{IPA|/p/}} in ''hiccough''\n* {{IPA|/x/}} in ''ugh''\nNon-digraph {{angbr|gh}} also occurs, in compounds like ''foghorn'', ''pigheaded''\n\nThe digraph {{angbr|[[Dg (digraph)|gn]]}} may represent \n* {{IPA|/n/}} as in ''gnostic'', ''deign'', ''foreigner'', ''signage''\n* {{IPA|/nj/}} in loanwords like ''champignon'', ''lasagna''\nNon-digraph {{angbr|gn}} also occurs, as in ''signature'', ''agnostic''\n\nThe trigraph  {{angbr|ngh}} has the value {{IPA|/\u014b/}} as in ''gingham'' or ''dinghy''. Non-trigraph {{angbr|ngh}} also occurs, in compounds like ''stronghold'' and ''dunghill''.\n\n===Other languages===\nMost Romance languages and some Nordic languages also have two main pronunciations for {{angbr|g}}, hard and soft. While the soft value of {{angbr|g}} varies in different Romance languages ({{IPA|/\u0292/}} in French and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], {{IPA|[(d)\u0292]}} in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} in Italian and Romanian, and {{IPA|/x/}} in most dialects of Spanish), in all except Romanian and Italian, soft {{angbr|g}} has the same pronunciation as the {{angbr|j}}.\n\nIn Italian and Romanian, {{angbr|gh}} is used to represent {{IPA|/\u0261/}} before front vowels where {{angbr|g}} would otherwise represent a soft value. In Italian and French, {{angbr|[[Gn (digraph)|gn]]}} is used to represent the [[palatal nasal]] {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, a sound somewhat similar to the {{angbr|ny}} in English ''canyon''. In Italian, the [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]] {{angbr|gli}}, when appearing before a vowel or as the article and pronoun ''[[wikt:gli|gli]]'', represents the [[palatal lateral approximant]] {{IPA|/\u028e/}}.\n\nOther languages typically use {{angbr|g}} to represent {{IPA|/\u0261/}} regardless of position.\n\nAmongst European languages [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] are an exception as they do not have {{IPA|/\u0261/}} in their native words. In [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{angbr|g}} represents a [[voiced velar fricative]] {{IPA|/\u0263/}} instead, a sound that does not occur in modern English, but there is a dialectal variation: many Netherlandic dialects use a voiceless fricative ({{IPA|[x]}} or {{IPA|[\u03c7]}}) instead, and in southern dialects it may be palatal {{IPA|[\u029d]}}. Nevertheless, word-finally it is always voiceless in all dialects, including the standard Dutch of Belgium and the Netherlands.

Mendel studied \"trait inheritance\", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring. He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete \"units of inheritance\". This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a [[gene]].\n\n[[Phenotypic trait|Trait]] inheritance and [[Molecular genetics|molecular]] inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century, but modern genetics has expanded beyond inheritance to studying the function and behavior of genes. Gene structure and function, variation, and distribution are studied within the context of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], the organism (e.g. [[Dominance (genetics)|dominance]]), and within the context of a population. Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields, including [[epigenetics]] and [[population genetics]]. Organisms studied within the broad field span the domains of life ([[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and [[eukarya]]).\n\nGenetic processes work in combination with an organism's environment and experiences to influence development and [[behavioural genetics|behavior]], often referred to as [[nature versus nurture]]. The [[intracellular]] or [[extracellular]] environment of a cell or organism may switch gene transcription on or off. A classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn, one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate. While the average height of the two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal, the one in the [[arid climate]] only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''genetics'' stems from the [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|genetikos}}'' meaning \"genitive\"/\"generative\", which in turn derives from {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|genesis}}'' meaning \"origin\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2321880&redirect=true |title=Genetikos (\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4-\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2) |work=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |accessdate=20 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100615000649/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=#1980&redirect=true |archivedate=15 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2321873&redirect=true |title=Genesis (\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) |work=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |accessdate=20 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100615000649/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=#1980&redirect=true |archivedate=15 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Genetic&searchmode=none |title=Genetic |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=20 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823020616/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Genetic&searchmode=none |archivedate=23 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of genetics}}\n\nThe observation that living things inherit [[Phenotypic trait|trait]]s from their parents has been used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through [[selective breeding]].<ref name=\"Publishing2009\">{{cite book |author=DK Publishing |title=Science: The Definitive Visual Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFiJFuzRVFQC&pg=PA362 |year=2009 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-7566-6490-9 |page=362}}</ref> The modern science of genetics, seeking to understand this process, began with the work of the [[Augustinian]] [[friar]] [[Gregor Mendel]] in the mid-19th century.<ref name=Weiling>{{cite journal |pmid=1887835| doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320400103 |year=1991 |last1=Weiling |first1=F |title=Historical study: Johann Gregor Mendel 1822\u20131884. |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201325; discussion 26 |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics}}</ref>\n\nPrior to Mendel, [[Imre Festetics]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] noble, who lived in K\u0151szeg before Mendel, was the first who used the word \"genetics.\" He described several rules of genetic inheritance in his work ''The genetic law of the Nature'' (Die genetische Ges\u00e4tze der Natur, 1819).

This phenomenon, known as \"[[Mendelian inheritance#Law of Independent Assortment (The \"Second Law\")|Mendel's second law]]\" or the \"law of independent assortment,\" means that the alleles of different genes get shuffled between parents to form offspring with many different combinations.

In the [[Blue-eyed Mary]] (''Omphalodes verna''), for example, there exists a gene with alleles that determine the color of flowers: blue or magenta. Another gene, however, controls whether the flowers have color at all or are white.

Diploid organisms form haploids by dividing, without replicating their DNA, to create daughter cells that randomly inherit one of each pair of chromosomes. Most animals and many plants are diploid for most of their lifespan, with the haploid form reduced to single cell [[gamete]]s such as [[sperm]] or [[Ovum|egg]]s.\n\nAlthough they do not use the haploid/diploid method of sexual reproduction, [[bacteria]] have many methods of acquiring new genetic information.

Because protein structures are the result of their amino acid sequences, some changes can dramatically change the properties of a protein by destabilizing the structure or changing the surface of the protein in a way that changes its interaction with other proteins and molecules.

[[Mutation]]s occasionally occur within cells in the body as they divide. Although these mutations will not be inherited by any offspring, they can affect the behavior of cells, sometimes causing them to grow and divide more frequently. There are biological mechanisms that attempt to stop this process; signals are given to inappropriately dividing cells that should trigger [[Apoptosis|cell death]], but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause cells to ignore these messages. An internal process of [[natural selection]] occurs within the body and eventually mutations accumulate within cells to promote their own growth, creating a cancerous [[Tumour heterogeneity|tumor]] that grows and invades various tissues of the body.\n\nNormally, a cell divides only in response to signals called [[growth factor]]s and [[Contact inhibition|stops growing once in contact with surrounding cells]] and in response to growth-inhibitory signals. It usually then divides a limited number of times and dies, staying within the [[epithelium]] where it is unable to migrate to other organs. To become a cancer cell, a cell has to accumulate mutations in a number of genes (three to seven) that allow it to bypass this regulation: it no longer needs growth factors to divide, continues growing when making contact to neighbor cells, ignores inhibitory signals, keeps growing indefinitely and is immortal, escapes from the epithelium and ultimately may be able to escape from the [[primary tumor]], cross the endothelium of a blood vessel, be transported by the bloodstream and colonize a new organ, forming deadly [[metastasis]]. Although there are some genetic predispositions in a small fraction of cancers, the major fraction is due to a set of new genetic mutations that originally appear and accumulate in one or a small number of cells that will divide to form the tumor and are not transmitted to the progeny ([[somatic mutation]]s). The most frequent mutations are a loss of function of [[p53 protein]], a [[tumor suppressor]], or in the p53 pathway, and gain of function mutations in the [[Ras proteins]], or in other [[oncogene]]s.\n\n===Research methods===\n[[File:Ecoli colonies.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Colony (biology)|Colonies]] of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' produced by [[Cloning#Unicellular organisms|cellular cloning]].

Many are set during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of the 1870s, describing the futility of war and the innocent civilians who, caught up in events beyond their control, are permanently changed by their experiences. He wrote some 300 short stories, six novels, three travel books, and one volume of verse. His first published story, \"[[Boule de Suif]]\" (\"Ball of Fat\", 1880), is often considered his masterpiece.\n\n=Biography=\n[[File:Maupassant 7 ans.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Guy de Maupassant 7 years old]]\n\nHenri-Ren\u00e9-Albert-Guy de Maupassant was born 5 August 1850 at the ''Ch\u00e2teau de Miromesnil'' (Castle Miromesnil, near [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]] in the [[Seine-Inf\u00e9rieure]] (now [[Seine-Maritime]]) department in France. He was the first son of Laure Le Poittevin and Gustave de Maupassant, both from prosperous bourgeois families. His mother urged his father when they married in 1846 to obtain the right to use the [[Nobiliary particle|particule]] or form \"de Maupassant\" instead of \"Maupassant\" as his family name, in order to indicate noble birth.<ref name=\"Gicquel 1993 p12\">Alain-Claude Gicquel, ''Maupassant, tel un m\u00e9t\u00e9ore'', Le Castor Astral, 1993, p. 12</ref> Gustave discovered a certain Jean-Baptiste Maupassant, ''conseiller-secr\u00e9taire'' to the King, who was ennobled in 1752.<ref name=\"Gicquel 1993 p12\"/> He then obtained from the ''Tribunal Civil'' of Rouen by decree dated 9 July 1846 the right to style himself \"de Maupassant\" instead of \"Maupassant\" and this was his surname at the birth of his son Guy in 1850.<ref name=\"Gicquel 1993 p12\"/>\n\nWhen Maupassant was 11 and his brother Herv\u00e9 was five, his mother, an independent-minded woman, risked social disgrace to obtain a legal separation from her husband, who was violent towards her.\n\nAfter the separation, Laure Le Poittevin kept her two sons. With the father's absence, Maupassant's mother became the most influential figure in the young boy's life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guy de Maupassant Biography|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/guy-de-maupassant|website=enotes|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> She was an exceptionally well-read woman and was very fond of classical literature, particularly [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. Until the age of thirteen, Guy happily lived with his mother, at [[\u00c9tretat]], in the Villa des Verguies, where, between the sea and the luxuriant countryside, he grew very fond of fishing and outdoor activities. At age thirteen, his mother next placed her two sons as day boarders in a private school, the Institution Leroy-Petit, in Rouen\u2014the ''Institution Robineau'' of Maupassant's story ''La Question du Latin''\u2014for classical studies.<ref>Maupassant, ''Choix de Contes'', Cambridge, p. viii, 1945</ref> From his early education he retained a marked hostility to religion, and to judge from verses composed around this time he deplored the ecclesiastical atmosphere, its ritual and discipline.<ref>{{cite book|last1=de Maupassant|first1=Guy|title=Le Horla et autres contes d'angoisse|date=1984|publisher=Flammarion|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-0807-1300-1|page=233|edition=2006|language=French}}</ref> Finding the place to be unbearable, he finally got himself expelled in his next-to-last year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biographie de Guy de Maupassant|url=http://www.alalettre.com/maupassant-bio.php|website=@lalettre.com|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1867, as he entered junior high school, Maupassant made acquaintance with [[Gustave Flaubert]] at Croisset at the insistence of his mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/369995/Guy-de-Maupassant|title= Maupassant's Apprenticeship with Flaubert}}</ref> Next year, in autumn, he was sent to the ''[[Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Corneille]]'' in Rouen<ref name=\"LyCo6\">{{cite web|url=http://lgcorneille-lyc.spip.ac-rouen.fr/spip.php?article6 |title=Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Corneille de Rouen - History |publisher=Lgcorneille-lyc.spip.ac-rouen.fr |date=1944-04-19 |accessdate=2018-03-13}}</ref> where he proved a good scholar indulging in poetry and taking a prominent part in theatricals. In October 1868, at the age of 18, he saved the famous poet [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] from drowning off the coast of \u00c9tretat.<ref>Clyde K. Hyder, ''Algernon Swinburne: The Critical Heritage'', 1995, p. 185</ref>\n\nThe [[Franco-Prussian War]] broke out soon after his graduation from college in 1870; he enlisted as a volunteer. In 1871, he left Normandy and moved to Paris where he spent ten years as a clerk in the Navy Department. During this time his only recreation and relaxation was boating on the [[Seine]] on Sundays and holidays.\n\nGustave Flaubert took him under his protection and acted as a kind of literary guardian to him, guiding his debut in journalism and literature. At Flaubert's home, he met [[\u00c9mile Zola]] and the Russian novelist [[Ivan Turgenev]], as well as many of the proponents of the [[realism (arts)|realist]] and [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] schools. He wrote and played himself in a comedy in 1875 (with the benediction of Flaubert), \"[[:fr:\u00c0 la feuille de rose, maison turque|\u00c0 la feuille de rose, maison turque]]\".\n\nIn 1878, he was transferred to the Ministry of Public Instruction and became a contributing editor to several leading newspapers such as ''[[Le Figaro]]'', ''[[Gil Blas (periodical)|Gil Blas]]'', ''[[Le Gaulois]]'' and ''[[l'\u00c9cho de Paris]]''. He devoted his spare time to writing novels and short stories.\n\nIn 1880 he published what is considered his first masterpiece, \"[[Boule de Suif]]\", which met with instant and tremendous success. Flaubert characterized it as \"a masterpiece that will endure.\" This was Maupassant's first piece of short fiction set during the Franco-Prussian War, and was followed by short stories such as \"[[Deux Amis]]\", \"[[Mother Savage]]\", and \"[[Mademoiselle Fifi (short story)|Mademoiselle Fifi]]\".\n\nThe decade from 1880 to 1891 was the most fertile period of Maupassant's life. Made famous by his first short story, he worked methodically and produced two or sometimes four volumes annually. His talent and practical business sense made him wealthy.\n\nIn 1881 he published his first volume of short stories under the title of ''La Maison Tellier''; it reached its twelfth edition within two years. In 1883 he finished his first novel, ''Une Vie'' (translated into English as ''A Woman's Life''), 25,000 copies of which were sold in less than a year. His second novel ''[[Bel Ami]]'', which came out in 1885, had thirty-seven printings in four months.\n\n[[File:Guy de Maupassant photo portrait young.jpg|thumb|Guy de Maupassant early in his career.]]\nHis editor, Havard, commissioned him to write more stories, and Maupassant continued to produce them efficiently and frequently. At this time he wrote what many consider to be his greatest novel, ''[[Pierre et Jean]]''.\n\nWith a natural aversion to society, he loved retirement, solitude, and meditation. He traveled extensively in [[Algeria]], Italy, England, [[Brittany]], [[Sicily]], [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], and from each voyage brought back a new volume. He cruised on his private yacht ''Bel-Ami'', named after his novel. This life did not prevent him from making friends among the literary celebrities of his day: [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]] had a paternal affection for him; at [[Aix-les-Bains]] he met [[Hippolyte Taine]] and became devoted to the philosopher-historian.\n\nFlaubert continued to act as his literary godfather. His friendship with the [[Edmond Louis Antoine Huot de Goncourt|Goncourts]] was of short duration; his frank and practical nature reacted against the ambiance of gossip, scandal, duplicity, and invidious criticism that the two brothers had created around them in the guise of an 18th-century style salon.\n\nMaupassant was one of a fair number of 19th-century Parisians (including [[Charles Gounod]], [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], and [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]) who did not care for the [[Eiffel Tower]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mariogagliardi.com/index.php?/archives/43-The-Tower-of-Babel-Gustave-Eiffel-and-the-creation-of-modernity.html|title=The Tower of Babel - ''Criticism of Eiffel Tower''|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013202211/http://mariogagliardi.com/index.php?%2Farchives%2F43-The-Tower-of-Babel-Gustave-Eiffel-and-the-creation-of-modernity.html|archivedate=13 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He often ate lunch in the restaurant at its base, not out of preference for the food but because it was only there that he could avoid seeing its otherwise unavoidable profile.<ref>Barthes, Roland.

Page 1.</ref> He and forty-six other Parisian literary and artistic notables attached their names to an elaborately irate letter of protest against the tower's construction, written to the Minister of Public Works.\n\nMaupassant also wrote under several [[pseudonym]]s such as Joseph Prunier, Guy de Valmont, and Maufrigneuse (which he used from 1881 to 1885).\n\nIn his later years he developed a constant desire for solitude, an obsession for self-preservation, and a fear of death and paranoia of persecution caused by the [[syphilis]] he had contracted in his youth. It has been suggested that his brother, Herv\u00e9, also suffered from syphilis and the disease may have been congenital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/arts/highlights/000808_maupassant.shtml |title=Remembering Maupassant &#124; Arts and Entertainment &#124; BBC World Service |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2000-08-09 |accessdate=2018-03-13}}</ref> On 2 January 1892, Maupassant tried to commit suicide by cutting his throat, and was committed to the private asylum of Esprit Blanche at [[Passy]], in Paris, where he died 6 July 1893.\n\nGuy De Maupassant penned his own [[epitaph]]: \"I have coveted everything and taken pleasure in nothing.\" He is buried in Section 26 of the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]], Paris.\n\n==Significance==\nMaupassant is considered one of the fathers of the modern short story. He delighted in clever plotting, and served as a model for [[Somerset Maugham]] and [[O. Henry]] in this respect. One of his famous short stories, \"[[The Necklace]]\", was imitated with a twist by both Maugham (\"Mr Know-All\", \"A String of Beads\") and [[Henry James]] (\"[[Paste (story)|Paste]]\").\n\nTaking his cue from [[Balzac]], Maupassant wrote comfortably in both the high-[[Realism (literature)|Realist]] and [[fantasy|fantastic]] modes; stories and novels such as \"L'H\u00e9ritage\" and ''Bel-Ami'' aim to recreate [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] France in a realistic way, whereas many of the short stories (notably \"[[Le Horla]]\" and \"Qui sait?\") describe apparently supernatural phenomena.\n\nThe supernatural in Maupassant, however, is often implicitly a symptom of the protagonists' troubled minds; Maupassant was fascinated by the burgeoning discipline of [[psychiatry]], and attended the public lectures of [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] between 1885 and 1886.<ref>Pierre Bayard, ''Maupassant, juste avant Freud'' (Paris: Minuit, 1998)</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Leo Tolstoy]] used Maupassant as the subject for one of his essays on art: ''[[s:The Works of Guy de Maupassant|The Works of Guy de Maupassant]]''. His stories are second only to Shakespeare in their inspiration of movie adaptations with films ranging from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[Oyuki the Virgin]]'' and ''[[Masculine Feminine]]''.<ref name=\"Richard Brody New Yorker\">{{cite news|url= http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-writer-who-sparks-the-finest-movie-adaptations|author = [[Richard Brody]]|title=The Writer Who Sparks the Finest Movie Adaptations| date=26 October 2015|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]| accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s [[Ecce Homo (Nietzsche)|autobiography]] mentions him in the following text:\n\n\"I cannot at all conceive in which century of history one could haul together such inquisitive and at the same time delicate psychologists as one can in contemporary Paris: I can name as a sample \u2013 for their number is by no means small, ... or to pick out one of the stronger race, a genuine Latin to whom I am particularly attached, Guy de Maupassant.\"\n\n[[William Saroyan]] wrote a short story about Maupassant in his 1971 book, ''[[Letters from 74 rue Taitbout]] or Don't Go But If You Must Say Hello To Everybody''.\n\n[[Isaac Babel]] wrote a short story about him, \u201cGuy de Maupassant.\u201d It appears in ''The Collected Stories of Isaac Babel'' and in the story anthology ''You\u2019ve Got To Read This: Contemporary American Writers Introduce Stories that Held Them in Awe.''\n\n[[Gene Roddenberry]], in an early draft for ''[[The Questor Tapes]]'', wrote a scene in which the [[Android (robot)|android]] ''Questor'' employs Maupassant's theory that, \"the human female will open her mind to a man to whom she has opened other channels of communications.\" In the script Questor copulates with a woman to obtain information that she is reluctant to impart.

In 1982, he returned to [[Constan\u021ba]], but one year later, aged 18, he was prepared to make the step to a top team. He was originally directed to [[CS Universitatea Craiova|Universitatea Craiova]], but chose [[FC Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti|Sportul Studen\u021besc]] of [[Bucharest]] instead.\n\nIn late 1987, Hagi transferred to [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] as the team prepared for their [[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup]] final against [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]. The original contract was for one game only, the final. However, after winning the trophy, where Hagi scored the only goal of the match, Steaua did not want to release him back to Sportul Studen\u021besc and retained him. During his Steaua years (1987\u20131990), Hagi played 97 [[Liga I]] games, scoring 76 goals. He and the team reached the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] semi-final in [[1987\u201388 European Cup|1988]] and the [[1989 European Cup Final|final]] in the following year, while Hagi finished as one of the competition's top scorers in the former edition of the tournament. Hagi and Steaua were the champions of Romania in 1987, 1988 and 1989 and as well as winning the [[Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]] in 1987, 1988 and 1989. His strong performances had him linked with [[Arrigo Sacchi]]'s [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], but [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]'s [[Socialist Republic of Romania|communist government]] rejected any offer.\n\nAfter the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], Hagi was signed by [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. The [[La Liga]] side paid $4.3&nbsp;million to Steaua Bucure\u0219ti for him. Hagi played two seasons with Madrid, then was sold to [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]].\n\nHagi began the [[1992\u201393 Serie A|1992\u201393 season]] with Brescia, but after his first season, the club was relegated to [[Serie B]]. The next season, Hagi helped the club win [[1993\u201394 Serie B|Serie B]] and earn promotion back to [[Serie A]]. After performing memorably during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], Hagi was signed by [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].\n\nAfter two years at ''Bar\u00e7a'', Hagi signed for Turkish club [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]]. At Galatasaray, he was both successful and highly popular among the Turkish supporters. Hagi was an important member of a team that would win four consecutive league titles. In 2000, at age 35, Hagi had the best days of his career winning every possible trophy with Galatasaray. Gala won the [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup]] after defeating [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[2000 UEFA Cup Final|final]], a match in which Hagi was sent off for punching Arsenal captain [[Tony Adams]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/752751.stm|title=BBC News - FOOTBALL - Penalty heartbreak for Arsenal|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> This was followed by the capture of the [[2000 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup]] with a historic win against Hagi's former club Real Madrid. Both feats were firsts, and remain unmatched in Turkish football history. The mass hysteria caused by these wins in [[Istanbul]] raised Hagi's popularity even further with the fans and prompted [[France national football team|French ex-international]] [[Luis Fern\u00e1ndez]] to say, \"Hagi is like wine, the older it gets, the better he is.\"\n\nWhen he retired in 2001, Hagi remained one of the most beloved players in the Turkish and Romanian championships. Hagi is highly praised by the Galatasaray supporters. The classic chant \"I Love You Hagi\" was adopted by Gala fans since his arrival at Galatasaray.\n\n==International career==\nHagi made his debut for the [[Romania national football team|Romania national team]] at age 18 in 1983 against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], in [[Oslo]]. He was part of the Romanian team until 2000.\n\nHagi took part at the 1990 World Cup and later led the Romanian team to its best ever international performance at the 1994 World Cup, where the team reached the quarterfinals before [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] ended their run after winning the penalty shoot-out. Hagi scored three times in the tournament, including a memorable goal in their 3\u20132 surprise defeat of South American powerhouse and previous runners-up [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. In the first of Romania's group stage matches, against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], Hagi scored one of the most memorable goals of that tournament, curling in a 40-yard lob over Colombian goalkeeper [[\u00d3scar C\u00f3rdoba]] who was caught out of position. He was named in the Team of the Tournament.\n\nFour years later, after the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], Hagi decided to retire from the national team, only to change his mind after a few months and participate in [[UEFA Euro 2000]], during which he was [[sent off]] in the quarter-final loss against [[UEFA Euro 2000 Final|eventual runners-up]] [[Italy national football team|Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://walloffame.infostradasports.com/asp/index.asp?SortId=63|title=Wall of Fame: Gheorghe Hagi|publisher=Infostrada Sports|accessdate=13 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nHagi retired from professional football in 2001, age 36, in a game called \"Gala Hagi\" on 24 April.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1294532.stm |title=Hagi takes an all-star bow |work=BBC Sport |date=24 April 2001 |accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref> He still holds the record as Romanian national team top scorer.\n\n==Career as coach==\n\n===Romania national team===\nIn 2001, Hagi was named the manager of the Romania national team, replacing [[Ladislau B\u00f6l\u00f6ni]], who left the squad to coach [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]]. After failing to qualify the team for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], however, Hagi was sacked. His only notable achievement during the six months as Romania's manager was the win in [[Budapest]] against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]].\n\n===Bursaspor===\nIn 2003, Hagi took over as coach of Turkish [[S\u00fcper Lig]] side [[Bursaspor]], but left the club after a disappointing start to the season.\n\n===Galatasaray===\nHagi then became manager of Galatasaray in 2004, leading the team to the [[Turkish Cup]] in [[2005 Turkish Cup Final|2005 final]] with 5\u20131 as a score against [[Fenerbah\u00e7e\u2013Galatasaray rivalry|fierce rivals]] [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K.

His contract, however, was not renewed since his team was not able to win [[2004\u201305 S\u00fcper Lig]] title over Fenerbah\u00e7e during the [[centennial]] of the club.\n\n===Politehnica Timi\u0219oara===\nSteaua Bucure\u0219ti sought to hire Hagi in the summer of 2005, but Hagi's requested wage could not be met by the Romanian champions, and he became manager of [[FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara|Politehnica Timi\u0219oara]] instead. However, after a string of poor results and disagreements with management, he left the club after a few months. Constan\u021ba's [[Stadionul Farul|main stadium]] used to bear his name, but the name was changed after Hagi signed with Politehnica Timi\u0219oara.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gandul.info/sport/constanta-s-lepadat-gheorghe-hagi.html?3941;253988 |title=Constanta s-a lepadat de Gheorghe Hagi |work=Gandul.info |language=Romanian |date=21 November 2005 |accessdate=4 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701031855/http://www.gandul.info/sport/constanta-s-lepadat-gheorghe-hagi.html?3941%3B253988 |archivedate=1 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Steaua Bucure\u0219ti===\nFrom June to September 2007, Hagi coached Steaua Bucure\u0219ti, had a mediocre start in the internal championship mainly due to the large number of unavailable injured players, and managed to qualify the team for the second time in line to the UEFA Champions League group stages, passing two qualifying rounds. He resigned due to a long series of conflicts with club owner [[Gigi Becali]], which also happens to be his godson. The main reason for resigning was the owner's policy of imposing players, making the team's strategy and threats. Hagi's resigned mere hours after Steaua's first Champions League match away against [[SK Slavia Prague|Slavia Prague]], a 2\u20131 loss.\n\n===Galatasaray return===\nAfter [[Frank Rijkaard]] was sacked as coach, Hagi signed a one and a half year contract with Galatasaray on 21 October 2010.

During this time he established himself as England's number one goalkeeper, and played every game of the nation's [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] victory. Despite this success, he was dropped by Leicester and sold on to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] for \u00a350,000 in April 1967.

He was still Stoke and England's number one when a car crash in October 1972 cost him both the sight in one eye and his professional career. He did though play in the [[United States]] for the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (1977\u20131983)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] in 1977 and 1978.

It was only in the 20th century that Leibniz's [[law of continuity]] and [[transcendental law of homogeneity]] found mathematical implementation (by means of [[non-standard analysis]]). He became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of [[mechanical calculator]]s. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to [[Pascal's calculator]], he was the first to describe a [[pinwheel calculator]] in 1685<ref>[[#SMITH|David Smith]], pp. 173\u2013181 (1929)</ref> and invented the [[Leibniz wheel]], used in the [[arithmometer]], the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the [[binary number]] system, which is the foundation of all digital computers.\n\nIn philosophy, Leibniz is most noted for his [[Philosophical optimism|optimism]], i.e. his conclusion that our [[universe]] is, in a restricted sense, the [[Best of all possible worlds|best possible one]] that God could have created, an idea that was often lampooned by others such as [[Voltaire]]. Leibniz, along with [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], was one of the three great 17th-century advocates of [[rationalism]]. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]], but his philosophy also looks back to the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or prior definitions rather than to empirical evidence.\n\nLeibniz made major contributions to [[physics]] and technology, and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in philosophy, [[probability theory]], [[biology]], medicine, geology, [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], and [[computer science]]. He wrote works on philosophy, politics, law, ethics, theology, history, and [[philology]]. Leibniz also contributed to the field of library science. While serving as overseer of the Wolfenb\u00fcttel library in Germany, he devised a cataloging system that would serve as a guide for many of Europe's largest libraries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.;  introduction by Donald G.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=SnRis5Gdi8gC&pg=PA21 Extract of page 21]</ref> He knew fairly little about the subject at that time but presented himself as deeply learned. He soon met [[Johann Christian von Boyneburg]] (1622\u20131672), the dismissed chief minister of the Elector of [[Mainz]], [[Johann Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn]].<ref>Mackie (1845), 43</ref> Von Boyneburg hired Leibniz as an assistant, and shortly thereafter reconciled with the Elector and introduced Leibniz to him. Leibniz then dedicated an essay on law to the Elector in the hope of obtaining employment. The stratagem worked; the Elector asked Leibniz to assist with the redrafting of the legal code for the Electorate.<ref>Mackie (1845), 44\u201345</ref> In 1669, Leibniz was appointed assessor in the Court of Appeal. Although von Boyneburg died late in 1672, Leibniz remained under the employment of his widow until she dismissed him in 1674.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nVon Boyneburg did much to promote Leibniz's reputation, and the latter's memoranda and letters began to attract favorable notice. After Leibniz's service to the Elector there soon followed a diplomatic role. He published an essay, under the pseudonym of a fictitious Polish nobleman, arguing (unsuccessfully) for the German candidate for the Polish crown. The main force in European geopolitics during Leibniz's adult life was the ambition of [[Louis XIV of France]], backed by French military and economic might. Meanwhile, the [[Thirty Years' War]] had left [[German language in Europe|German-speaking Europe]] exhausted, fragmented, and economically backward. Leibniz proposed to protect German-speaking Europe by distracting Louis as follows. France would be invited to take [[Egypt]] as a stepping stone towards an eventual conquest of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. In return, France would agree to leave Germany and the Netherlands undisturbed. This plan obtained the Elector's cautious support. In 1672, the French government invited Leibniz to Paris for discussion,<ref>Mackie (1845), 58\u201361</ref> but the plan was soon overtaken by the outbreak of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] and became irrelevant. Napoleon's [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|failed invasion of Egypt in 1798]] can be seen as an unwitting, late implementation of Leibniz's plan, after the Eastern hemisphere colonial supremacy in Europe had already passed from the Dutch to the British.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThus Leibniz went to Paris in 1672. Soon after arriving, he met Dutch physicist and mathematician [[Christiaan Huygens]] and realised that his own knowledge of mathematics and physics was patchy. With Huygens as his mentor, he began a program of [[self-study]] that soon pushed him to making major contributions to both subjects, including discovering his version of the differential and integral [[calculus]]. He met [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Antoine Arnauld]], the leading French philosophers of the day, and studied the writings of [[Descartes]] and [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], unpublished as well as published.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/#Life|title=Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|last=|first=|date=|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=}}</ref> He befriended a German mathematician, [[Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus]]; they corresponded for the rest of their lives.\n\n[[File:Leibnitzrechenmaschine.jpg|thumb|[[Stepped reckoner]]]]\n\nWhen it became clear that France would not implement its part of Leibniz's Egyptian plan, the Elector sent his nephew, escorted by Leibniz, on a related mission to the English government in London, early in 1673.<ref>Mackie (1845), 69\u201370</ref> There Leibniz came into acquaintance of [[Henry Oldenburg]] and [[John Collins (mathematician)|John Collins]]. He met with the [[Royal Society]] where he demonstrated a calculating machine that he had designed and had been building since 1670. The machine was able to execute all four basic operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing), and the society quickly made him an external member.\n\nThe mission ended abruptly when news of the Elector's death (12 February 1673) reached them. Leibniz promptly returned to Paris and not, as had been planned, to Mainz.<ref>Mackie (1845), 73\u201374</ref> The sudden deaths of his two patrons in the same winter meant that Leibniz had to find a new basis for his career.\n\nIn this regard, a 1669 invitation from the [[John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|John Frederick]] of [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Brunswick]] to visit Hanover proved to have been fateful. Leibniz had declined the invitation, but had begun corresponding with the duke in 1671. In 1673, the duke offered Leibniz the post of counsellor. Leibniz very reluctantly accepted the position two years later, only after it became clear that no employment in Paris, whose intellectual stimulation he relished, or with the [[Habsburg]] imperial court, was forthcoming.<ref name=\"CRC Press\">{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Martin|title=The Universal Computer : The Road from Leibniz to Turing|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1-138-50208-1|pages=9}}</ref>\n\nIn 1675 he tried to get admitted to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] as a foreign honorary member, but it was considered that there were already enough foreigners there and so no invitation came. He left Paris in October 1676.\n\n===House of Hanover, 1676\u20131716===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}\nLeibniz managed to delay his arrival in Hanover until the end of 1676 after making one more short journey to London, where Newton accused him of having seen Newton's unpublished work on calculus in advance.<ref>On the encounter between Newton and Leibniz and a review of the evidence, see Alfred Rupert Hall, ''Philosophers at War: The Quarrel Between Newton and Leibniz'', (Cambridge, 2002), pp. 44\u201369.</ref>  This was alleged to be evidence supporting the accusation, made decades later, that he had stolen calculus from Newton. On the journey from London to Hanover, Leibniz stopped in [[The Hague]] where he met [[van Leeuwenhoek]], the discoverer of microorganisms. He also spent several days in intense discussion with [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], who had just completed his masterwork, the ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''.<ref>Mackie (1845), 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nIn 1677, he was promoted, at his request, to Privy Counselor of Justice, a post he held for the rest of his life. Leibniz served three consecutive rulers of the House of Brunswick as historian, political adviser, and most consequentially, as librarian of the [[duke|ducal]] library. He thenceforth employed his pen on all the various political, historical, and [[theological]] matters involving the House of Brunswick; the resulting documents form a valuable part of the historical record for the period.\n\nLeibniz began promoting a project to use windmills to improve the mining operations in the Harz Mountains. This project did little to improve mining operations and was shut down by Duke Ernst August in 1685.<ref name=\"CRC Press\"/>\n\nAmong the few people in north Germany to accept Leibniz were the Electress [[Sophia of Hanover]] (1630\u20131714), her daughter [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]] (1668\u20131705), the Queen of Prussia and his avowed disciple, and [[Caroline of Ansbach]], the consort of her grandson, the future [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. To each of these women he was correspondent, adviser, and friend. In turn, they all approved of Leibniz more than did their spouses and the future king [[George I of Great Britain]].<ref>For a study of Leibniz's correspondence with Sophia Charlotte, see MacDonald Ross, George, 1990, \"Leibniz's Exposition of His System to Queen Sophie Charlotte and Other Ladies.\" In ''Leibniz in Berlin'', ed. H. Poser and A. Heinekamp, Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 1990, 61\u201369.</ref>\n\nThe population of Hanover was only about 10,000, and its provinciality eventually grated on Leibniz. Nevertheless, to be a major courtier to the House of [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Brunswick]] was quite an honor, especially in light of the meteoric rise in the prestige of that House during Leibniz's association with it. In 1692, the Duke of Brunswick became a hereditary Elector of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The British [[Act of Settlement 1701]] designated the Electress Sophia and her descent as the royal family of England, once both King [[William III of England|William III]] and his sister-in-law and successor, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], were dead. Leibniz played a role in the initiatives and negotiations leading up to that Act, but not always an effective one. For example, something he published anonymously in England, thinking to promote the Brunswick cause, was formally censured by the [[British Parliament]].\n\nThe Brunswicks tolerated the enormous effort Leibniz devoted to intellectual pursuits unrelated to his duties as a courtier, pursuits such as perfecting calculus, writing about other mathematics, logic, physics, and philosophy, and keeping up a vast correspondence. He began working on calculus in 1674; the earliest evidence of its use in his surviving notebooks is 1675. By 1677 he had a coherent system in hand, but did not publish it until 1684. Leibniz's most important mathematical papers were published between 1682 and 1692, usually in a journal which he and [[Otto Mencke]] founded in 1682, the ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]''. That journal played a key role in advancing his mathematical and scientific reputation, which in turn enhanced his eminence in diplomacy, history, theology, and philosophy.\n\n[[File:Korespondencja Gottfrieda Leibniza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Leibniz's correspondence, papers and notes from 1669 to 1704, [[National Library of Poland]].]]\n\nThe Elector [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Ernest Augustus]] commissioned Leibniz to write a history of the House of Brunswick, going back to the time of [[Charlemagne]] or earlier, hoping that the resulting book would advance his dynastic ambitions. From 1687 to 1690, Leibniz traveled extensively in Germany, Austria, and Italy, seeking and finding archival materials bearing on this project. Decades went by but no history appeared; the next Elector became quite annoyed at Leibniz's apparent dilatoriness. Leibniz never finished the project, in part because of his huge output on many other fronts, but also because he insisted on writing a meticulously researched and erudite book based on archival sources, when his patrons would have been quite happy with a short popular book, one perhaps little more than a [[genealogy]] with commentary, to be completed in three years or less. They never knew that he had in fact carried out a fair part of his assigned task: when the material Leibniz had written and collected for his history of the House of Brunswick was finally published in the 19th century, it filled three volumes.\n\nLeibniz was appointed Librarian of the [[Herzog August Library]] in [[Wolfenb\u00fcttel]], [[Lower Saxony]], in 1691.\n\nIn 1708, [[John Keill]], writing in the journal of the Royal Society and with Newton's presumed blessing, accused Leibniz of having plagiarised Newton's calculus.<ref>Mackie (1845), 109</ref> Thus began the [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|calculus priority dispute]] which darkened the remainder of Leibniz's life. A formal investigation by the Royal Society (in which Newton was an unacknowledged participant), undertaken in response to Leibniz's demand for a retraction, upheld Keill's charge. Historians of mathematics writing since 1900 or so have tended to acquit Leibniz, pointing to important differences between Leibniz's and Newton's versions of calculus.\n\nIn 1711, while traveling in northern Europe, the Russian [[Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] stopped in Hanover and met Leibniz, who then took some interest in Russian matters for the rest of his life. In 1712, Leibniz began a two-year residence in [[Vienna]], where he was appointed Imperial Court Councillor to the [[Habsburg]]s. On the death of Queen Anne in 1714, Elector George Louis became King [[George I of Great Britain]], under the terms of the 1701 Act of Settlement. Even though Leibniz had done much to bring about this happy event, it was not to be his hour of glory. Despite the intercession of the Princess of Wales, Caroline of Ansbach, George I forbade Leibniz to join him in London until he completed at least one volume of the history of the Brunswick family his father had commissioned nearly 30 years earlier. Moreover, for George I to include Leibniz in his London court would have been deemed insulting to Newton, who was seen as having won the calculus priority dispute and whose standing in British official circles could not have been higher. Finally, his dear friend and defender, the Dowager Electress Sophia, died in 1714.\n\n===Death===\nLeibniz died in [[Hanover]] in 1716: at the time, he was so out of favor that neither George I (who happened to be near Hanover at that time) nor any fellow courtier other than his personal secretary attended the funeral. Even though Leibniz was a life member of the Royal Society and the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]], neither organization saw fit to honor his death. His grave went unmarked for more than 50 years. Leibniz was eulogized by [[Bernard de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]], before the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in Paris, which had admitted him as a foreign member in 1700. The eulogy was composed at the behest of the [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine|Duchess of Orleans]], a niece of the Electress Sophia.\n\n===Personal life===\nLeibniz never married. He complained on occasion about money, but the fair sum he left to his sole heir, his sister's stepson, proved that the Brunswicks had, by and large, paid him well. In his diplomatic endeavors, he at times verged on the unscrupulous, as was all too often the case with professional diplomats of his day. On several occasions, Leibniz backdated and altered personal manuscripts, actions which put him in a bad light during the [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|calculus controversy]]. On the other hand, he was charming, well-mannered, and not without humor and imagination.<ref>See Wiener IV.6 and Loemker \u00a740.

On Leibniz's religious views, though he was a [[protestant]], Leibniz learned to appreciate aspects of [[Catholicism]] through his patrons and colleagues.

Nonetheless, Leibniz is a theist. His system is generated from, and needs, the postulate of a creative god.

According to their doctrine, God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time; otherwise it would cease to move.\" (Leibniz 1715, 675) Leibniz argues that any scientific theory that relies on God to perform miracles after He had first made the universe indicates that God lacked sufficient foresight or power to establish adequate natural laws in the first place. In defense of Newton's theism, Clarke is unapologetic: \"'tis not a diminution but the true glory of his workmanship that nothing is done without his continual government and inspection\"' (Leibniz 1715, 676\u2013677). Clarke is believed to have consulted closely with Newton on how to respond to Leibniz.

He wrote only two book-length philosophical treatises, of which only the ''Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e'' of 1710 was published in his lifetime.\n\nLeibniz dated his beginning as a philosopher to his ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'', which he composed in 1686 as a commentary on a running dispute between [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Antoine Arnauld]]. This led to an extensive and valuable correspondence with Arnauld;<ref>Ariew & Garber, 69; Loemker, \u00a7\u00a736, 38</ref> it and the ''Discourse'' were not published until the 19th century. In 1695, Leibniz made his public entr\u00e9e into European philosophy with a journal article titled \"New System of the Nature and Communication of Substances\".<ref>Ariew & Garber, 138; Loemker, \u00a747; Wiener, II.4</ref> Between 1695 and 1705, he composed his ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding]]'', a lengthy commentary on [[John Locke]]'s 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', but upon learning of Locke's 1704 death, lost the desire to publish it, so that the ''New Essays'' were not published until 1765. The ''[[Monadology|Monadologie]]'', composed in 1714 and published posthumously, consists of 90 aphorisms.\n\nLeibniz met [[Spinoza]] in 1676, read some of his unpublished writings, and has since been suspected of appropriating some of Spinoza's ideas. While Leibniz admired Spinoza's powerful intellect, he was also forthrightly dismayed by Spinoza's conclusions,<ref>Ariew & Garber, 272\u2013284; Loemker, \u00a7\u00a714, 20, 21; Wiener, III.8</ref> especially when these were inconsistent with Christian orthodoxy.\n\nUnlike Descartes and Spinoza, Leibniz had a thorough university education in philosophy. He was influenced by his [[Leipzig]] professor [[Jakob Thomasius]], who also supervised his BA thesis in philosophy.<ref name=\"Arthur p. 13\">Arthur 2014, p. 13.</ref> Leibniz also eagerly read [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez]], a Spanish [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] respected even in [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] universities. Leibniz was deeply interested in the new methods and conclusions of Descartes, Huygens, Newton, and [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], but viewed their work through a lens heavily tinted by scholastic notions. Yet it remains the case that Leibniz's methods and concerns often anticipate the [[logic]], and [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[linguistic philosophy]] of the 20th century.\n\n=== Principles===<!--Linked from \"Difference (philosophy)\"-->\nLeibniz variously invoked one or another of seven fundamental philosophical Principles:<ref>Mates (1986), chpts. 7.3, 9</ref>\n* [[Identity (mathematics)|Identity]]/[[contradiction]]. If a proposition is true, then its negation is false and vice versa.\n* [[Identity of indiscernibles]]. Two distinct things cannot have all their properties in common. If every predicate possessed by x is also possessed by y and vice versa, then entities x and y are identical; to suppose two things indiscernible is to suppose the same thing under two names. Frequently invoked in modern logic and philosophy, the \"identity of indiscernibles\" is often referred to as Leibniz's Law.

He proposes his theory that the universe is made of an infinite number of simple substances known as monads.<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Leary-Hawthorne|first1=John|last2=Cover|first2=J.A.|title=Substance and Individuation in Leibniz|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-07303-0|page=65}}</ref> Monads can also be compared to the corpuscles of the [[Mechanical Philosophy]] of Ren\u00e9 Descartes and others. These simple substances or monads are the \"ultimate units of existence in nature\". Monads have no parts but still exist by the qualities that they have. These qualities are continuously changing over time, and each monad is unique. They are also not affected by time and are subject to only creation and annihilation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rescher|first1=Nicholas|title=G.W.

Using the principle of reasoning, Leibniz concluded that the first reason of all things is God.<ref name=\"Leibniz: A Guide for the Perplexed\"/> All that we see and experience are subject to change, and the fact that this world is contingent can be explained by the possibility of the world being arranged differently in space and time. The contingent world must have some necessary reason for its existence. Leibniz uses a geometry book as an example to explain his reasoning. If this book was copied from an infinite chain of copies, there must be a some reason for the content of the book.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perkins|first1=Franklin|title=Leibniz: A Guide for the Perplexed|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=0-8264-8921-4|page=23}}</ref> Leibniz concluded that there must be the \"''monas monadum''\" or God.\n\nThe [[ontology|ontological]] essence of a monad is its irreducible simplicity. Unlike atoms, monads possess no material or spatial character. They also differ from atoms by their complete mutual independence, so that interactions among monads are only apparent. Instead, by virtue of the principle of [[pre-established harmony]], each monad follows a preprogrammed set of \"instructions\" peculiar to itself, so that a monad \"knows\" what to do at each moment. By virtue of these intrinsic instructions, each monad is like a little mirror of the universe. Monads need not be \"small\"; e.g., each human being constitutes a monad, in which case [[free will]] is problematic.\n\nMonads are purported to have gotten rid of the problematic:\n* interaction between [[mind]] and matter arising in the system of [[Descartes]];\n* lack of [[Principle of individuation|individuation]] inherent to the system of [[Spinoza]], which represents individual creatures as merely accidental.\n\n===Theodicy and optimism===\n{{further|Best of all possible worlds|Philosophical optimism}}\n\nThe ''[[Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e|Theodicy]]''<ref>Rutherford (1998) is a detailed scholarly study of Leibniz's [[theodicy]].</ref> tries to justify the apparent imperfections of the world by claiming that it is [[Best of all possible worlds|optimal among all possible worlds]]. It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.\n\nLeibniz asserted that the truths of theology (religion) and philosophy cannot contradict each other, since reason and faith are both \"gifts of God\" so that their conflict would imply God contending against himself. The ''Theodicy'' is Leibniz's attempt to reconcile his personal philosophical system with his interpretation of the tenets of Christianity.<ref>Magill, Frank (ed.). ''Masterpieces of World Philosophy''. New York: Harper Collins (1990).</ref> This project was motivated in part by Leibniz's belief, shared by many conservative philosophers and theologians during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in the rational and enlightened nature of the Christian religion as compared to its purportedly less advanced non-Western counterparts. It was also shaped by Leibniz's belief in the perfectibility of human nature (if humanity relied on correct philosophy and religion as a guide), and by his belief that metaphysical necessity must have a rational or logical foundation, even if this metaphysical causality seemed inexplicable in terms of physical necessity (the natural laws identified by science).\n\nBecause reason and faith must be entirely reconciled, any tenet of faith which could not be defended by reason must be rejected. Leibniz then approached one of the central criticisms of Christian theism:<ref>Magill, Frank (ed.) (1990)</ref> if God is [[Omnibenevolent|all good]], [[Omniscience|all wise]] and [[Omnipotent|all powerful]], how did [[Problem of evil|evil come into the world]]? The answer (according to Leibniz) is that, while God is indeed unlimited in wisdom and power, his human creations, as creations, are limited both in their wisdom and in their will (power to act). This predisposes humans to false beliefs, wrong decisions and ineffective actions in the exercise of their [[free will]]. God does not arbitrarily inflict pain and suffering on humans; rather he permits both ''moral evil'' (sin) and ''physical evil'' (pain and suffering) as the necessary consequences of ''metaphysical evil'' (imperfection), as a means by which humans can identify and correct their erroneous decisions, and as a contrast to true good.\n\nFurther, although human actions flow from prior causes that ultimately arise in God, and therefore are known as a metaphysical certainty to God, an individual's free will is exercised within natural laws, where choices are merely contingently necessary, to be decided in the event by a \"wonderful spontaneity\" that provides individuals an escape from rigorous predestination.\n\n=== ''Discourse on Metaphysics'' ===\nFor Leibniz, \"God is an absolutely perfect being.\" He describes this perfection later in section VI as the simplest form of something with the most substantial outcome (VI). Along these lines, he declares that every type of perfection \"pertains to him (God) in the highest degree\" (I). Even though his types of perfections are not specifically drawn out, Leibniz highlights the one thing that, to him, does certify imperfections and proves that God is perfect: \"that one acts imperfectly if he acts with less perfection than he is capable of\", and since God is a perfect being, he cannot act imperfectly (III). Because God cannot act imperfectly, the decisions he makes pertaining to the world must be perfect. Leibniz also comforts readers, stating that because he has done everything to the most perfect degree; those who love him cannot be injured. However, to love God is a subject of difficulty as Leibniz believes that we are \"not disposed to wish for that which God desires\" because we have the ability to alter our disposition (IV). In accordance with this, many act as rebels, but Leibniz says that the only way we can truly love God is by being content \"with all that comes to us according to his will\" (IV).\n\nBecause God is \"an absolutely perfect being\" (I), Leibniz argues that God would be acting imperfectly if he acted with any less perfection than what he is able of (III). His syllogism then ends with the statement that God has made the world perfectly in all ways. This also affects how we should view God and his will. Leibniz states that, in lieu of God\u2019s will, we have to understand that God \"is the best of all masters\" and he will know when his good succeeds, so we, therefore, must act in conformity to his good will\u2014or as much of it as we understand (IV). In our view of God, Leibniz declares that we cannot admire the work solely because of the maker, lest we mar the glory and love God in doing so. Instead, we must admire the maker for the work he has done (II). Effectively, Leibniz states that if we say the earth is good because of the will of God, and not good according to some standards of goodness, then how can we praise God for what he has done if contrary actions are also praiseworthy by this definition (II). Leibniz then asserts that different principles and geometry cannot simply be from the will of God, but must follow from his understanding.<ref>Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm. ''Discourse on Metaphysics.

Leibniz wrote memoranda<ref>Many of his memoranda are translated in Parkinson 1966.</ref> that can now be read as groping attempts to get symbolic logic\u2014and thus his ''calculus''\u2014off the ground. These writings remained unpublished until the appearance of a selection edited by C.I. Gerhardt (1859). L. Couturat published a selection in 1901; by this time the main developments of modern logic had been created by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and by [[Gottlob Frege]].\n\nLeibniz thought [[symbol]]s were important for human understanding. He attached so much importance to the development of good notations that he attributed all his discoveries in mathematics to this. His notation for [[calculus]] is an example of his skill in this regard. Peirce, a 19th-century pioneer of [[semiotics]], shared Leibniz's passion for symbols and notation, and his belief that these are essential to a well-running logic and mathematics.\n\nBut Leibniz took his speculations much further. Defining a [[Grapheme|character]] as any written sign, he then defined a \"real\" character as one that represents an idea directly and not simply as the word embodying the idea. Some real characters, such as the notation of logic, serve only to facilitate reasoning. Many characters well known in his day, including [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]], [[Chinese character]]s, and the symbols of [[astronomy]] and [[chemistry]], he deemed not real.<ref>Loemker, however, who translated some of Leibniz's works into English, said that the symbols of chemistry were real characters, so there is disagreement among Leibniz scholars on this point.</ref><!--is this paragraph correct up to this point?--> Instead, he proposed the creation of a ''[[characteristica universalis]]'' or \"universal characteristic\", built on an [[alphabet of human thought]] in which each fundamental concept would be represented by a unique \"real\" character:\n\n<blockquote>It is obvious that if we could find characters or signs suited for expressing all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometry expresses lines, we could do in all matters ''insofar as they are subject to reasoning'' all that we can do in arithmetic and geometry. For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus.<ref>''Preface to the General Science'', 1677. Revision of Rutherford's translation in Jolley 1995: 234. Also Wiener I.4</ref></blockquote>\n\nComplex thoughts would be represented by combining characters for simpler thoughts. Leibniz saw that the uniqueness of [[prime factorization]] suggests a central role for [[prime numbers]] in the universal characteristic, a striking anticipation of [[G\u00f6del numbering]]. Granted, there is no intuitive or [[mnemonic]] way to number any set of elementary concepts using the prime numbers. \n\nBecause Leibniz was a mathematical novice when he first wrote about the ''characteristic'', at first he did not conceive it as an [[algebra]] but rather as a [[universal characteristic|universal language]] or script. Only in 1676 did he conceive of a kind of \"algebra of thought\", modeled on and including conventional algebra and its notation. The resulting ''characteristic'' included a logical calculus, some combinatorics, algebra, his ''analysis situs'' (geometry of situation), a universal concept language, and more. What Leibniz actually intended by his ''characteristica universalis'' and calculus ratiocinator, and the extent to which modern formal logic does justice to calculus, may never be established.<ref>A good introductory discussion of the \"characteristic\" is Jolley (1995: 226\u2013240). An early, yet still classic, discussion of the \"characteristic\" and \"calculus\" is Couturat (1901: chpts. 3, 4).</ref> Leibniz's idea of reasoning through a universal language of symbols and calculations remarkably foreshadows great 20th-century developments in formal systems, such as [[Turing completeness]], where computation was used to define equivalent universal languages (see [[Turing degree]]).\n\n===Formal logic===\n{{Main|Algebraic logic}}\nLeibniz has been noted as one of the most important logicians between the times of Aristotle and [[Gottlob Frege]].<ref>Lenzen, W., 2004, \"Leibniz's Logic,\" in ''Handbook of the History of Logic'' by D. M. Gabbay/J. Woods (eds.), volume 3: ''The Rise of Modern Logic: From Leibniz to Frege'', Amsterdam et al.: Elsevier-North-Holland, pp. 1\u201383.</ref> Leibniz enunciated the principal properties of what we now call [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[disjunction]], [[negation]], [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]], set [[subset|inclusion]], and the [[empty set]]. The principles of Leibniz's logic and, arguably, of his whole philosophy, reduce to two:\n\n# All our ideas are compounded from a very small number of simple ideas, which form the [[alphabet of human thought]].\n# Complex ideas proceed from these simple ideas by a uniform and symmetrical combination, analogous to arithmetical multiplication.\n\nThe formal logic that emerged early in the 20th century also requires, at minimum, unary negation and [[Quantification (logic)|quantified]] [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] ranging over some [[universe of discourse]].\n\nLeibniz published nothing on formal logic in his lifetime; most of what he wrote on the subject consists of working drafts. In his book ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] went so far as to claim that Leibniz had developed logic in his unpublished writings to a level which was reached only 200 years later.\n\nRussell's principal work on Leibniz found that many of Leibniz's most startling  philosophical ideas and claims (e.g., that each of the fundamental [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]] mirrors the whole universe) follow logically from Leibniz's conscious choice to reject ''relations'' between things as unreal. He regarded such relations as (real) ''qualities'' of things (Leibniz admitted [[unary function|unary]] [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] only): For him \"Mary is the mother of John\" describes separate qualities of Mary and of John. This view contrasts with the relational logic of [[Augustus de Morgan|De Morgan]], [[Charles S. Peirce|Peirce]], [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der|Schr\u00f6der]] and Russell himself, now standard in [[predicate logic]].

According to Leibniz's notebooks, a critical breakthrough occurred on 11 November 1675, when he employed integral calculus for the first time to find the area under the graph of a function {{math|1={{var|y}} = {{var|f}}({{var|x}})}}.<ref name=\"Leibniz1920\">{{cite book|last1=Leibniz|first1=Gottfried Wilhelm Freiherr von|last2=Gerhardt|first2=Carl Immanuel (trans.)|title=The Early Mathematical Manuscripts of Leibniz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QG_QAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA93|accessdate=10 November 2013|year=1920|publisher=Open Court Publishing|page=93}}</ref> He introduced several notations used to this day, for instance the [[integral sign]] {{math|\u222b}}, representing an elongated S, from the Latin word ''summa'', and the {{math|d}} used for [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differentials]], from the Latin word ''differentia''. Leibniz did not publish anything about his calculus until 1684.<ref>For an English translation of this paper, see Struik (1969: 271\u2013284), who also translates parts of two other key papers by Leibniz on calculus.</ref> Leibniz expressed the inverse relation of integration and differentiation, later called the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], by means of a figure<ref>[[Dirk Jan Struik]], ''A Source Book in Mathematics'' (1969) pp.&nbsp;282\u2013284</ref> in his 1693 paper ''Supplementum geometriae dimensoriae...''.<ref>''Supplementum geometriae dimensoriae, seu generalissima omnium tetragonismorum effectio per motum: similiterque multiplex constructio lineae ex data tangentium conditione'', ''Acta Euriditorum'' (Sep. 1693) pp. 385\u2013392</ref> However, [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] is credited for the theorem's discovery in geometric form, [[Isaac Barrow]] proved a more generalized geometric version, and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] developed supporting theory. The concept became more transparent as developed through Leibniz's formalism and new notation.<ref>[[John Stillwell]], ''Mathematics and its History'' (1989, 2002) p.159</ref> The [[product rule]] of [[differential calculus]] is still called \"Leibniz's law\". In addition, the theorem that tells how and when to differentiate under the integral sign is called the [[Leibniz integral rule]].\n\nLeibniz exploited [[infinitesimal]]s in developing calculus, manipulating them in ways suggesting that they had [[paradox]]ical [[algebra]]ic properties. [[George Berkeley]], in a tract called ''[[The Analyst]]'' and also in ''De Motu'', criticized these. A recent study argues that Leibnizian calculus was free of contradictions, and was better grounded than Berkeley's empiricist criticisms.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Katz | first1 = Mikhail\n | author1-link = Mikhail Katz\n | last2 = Sherry | first2 = David\n | arxiv = 1205.0174\n | doi = 10.1007/s10670-012-9370-y\n | journal = [[Erkenntnis]]\n | volume = 78\n | issue = 3\n | page = 571\n | title = Leibniz's Infinitesimals: Their Fictionality, Their Modern Implementations, and Their Foes from Berkeley to Russell and Beyond\n | year = 2012}}</ref>\n   \nFrom 1711 until his death, Leibniz was engaged in a dispute with John Keill, Newton and others, over whether Leibniz had invented calculus independently of Newton. This subject is treated at length in the article [[Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy]].\n\nThe use of infinitesimals in mathematics was frowned upon by followers of [[Karl Weierstrass]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} but survived in science and engineering, and even in rigorous mathematics, via the fundamental computational device known as the [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]]. Beginning in 1960, [[Abraham Robinson]] worked out a rigorous foundation for Leibniz's infinitesimals, using [[model theory]], in the context of a field of [[hyperreal number]]s. The resulting [[non-standard analysis]] can be seen as a belated vindication of Leibniz's mathematical reasoning. Robinson's [[transfer principle]] is a mathematical implementation of Leibniz's heuristic [[law of continuity]], while the [[standard part function]] implements the Leibnizian [[transcendental law of homogeneity]].\n\n===Topology===\nLeibniz was the first to use the term ''analysis situs'',<ref>Loemker \u00a727</ref> later used in the 19th century to refer to what is now known as [[topology]]. There are two takes on this situation. On the one hand, Mates, citing a 1954 paper in German by [[Jacob Freudenthal]], argues:\n\n<blockquote>Although for Leibniz the situs of a sequence of points is completely determined by the distance between them and is altered if those distances are altered, his admirer [[Euler]], in the famous 1736 paper solving the [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg|K\u00f6nigsberg Bridge Problem]] and its generalizations, used the term ''geometria situs'' in such a sense that the situs remains unchanged under topological deformations. He mistakenly credits Leibniz with originating this concept. ... [It] is sometimes not realized that Leibniz used the term in an entirely different sense and hence can hardly be considered the founder of that part of mathematics.<ref>Mates (1986), 240</ref></blockquote>\n\nBut Hideaki Hirano argues differently, quoting [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.t.hosei.ac.jp/~hhirano/academia/leibniz.htm |title=Leibniz's Cultural Pluralism And Natural Law |last=Hirano |first=Hideaki |accessdate=10 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522130455/http://www.t.hosei.ac.jp/~hhirano/academia/leibniz.htm |archivedate=22 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>To sample Leibniz' scientific works is a sobering experience. Next to calculus, and to other thoughts that have been carried out to completion, the number and variety of premonitory thrusts is overwhelming. We saw examples in \"packing\",&nbsp;... My Leibniz mania is further reinforced by finding that for one moment its hero attached importance to geometric scaling. In ''Euclidis Prota''&nbsp;..., which is an attempt to tighten Euclid's axioms, he states&nbsp;...: \"I have diverse definitions for the straight line. The straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole, and it alone has this property, not only among curves but among sets.\" This claim can be proved today.<ref>Mandelbrot (1977), 419. Quoted in Hirano (1997).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThus the [[fractal|fractal geometry]] promoted by Mandelbrot drew on Leibniz's notions of [[self-similarity]] and the principle of continuity: ''[[Natura non facit saltus]]''.<ref name=\"Saltus\"/> We also see that when Leibniz wrote, in a metaphysical vein, that \"the straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole\", he was anticipating topology by more than two centuries. As for \"packing\", Leibniz told his friend and correspondent Des Bosses to imagine a circle, then to inscribe within it three congruent circles with maximum radius; the latter smaller circles could be filled with three even smaller circles by the same procedure. This process can be continued infinitely, from which arises a good idea of self-similarity. Leibniz's improvement of Euclid's axiom contains the same concept.\n\n==Scientist and engineer==\nLeibniz's writings are currently discussed, not only for their anticipations and possible discoveries not yet recognized, but as ways of advancing present knowledge. Much of his writing on physics is included in Gerhardt's ''Mathematical Writings''.\n\n===Physics===\n{{See also|Dynamism (metaphysics)|Conatus#In Leibniz}}\nLeibniz contributed a fair amount to the statics and dynamics emerging around him, often disagreeing with [[Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. He devised a new theory of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] ([[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]) based on [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]], which posited space as relative, whereas Newton was thoroughly convinced that space was absolute. An important example of Leibniz's mature physical thinking is his ''Specimen Dynamicum'' of 1695.<ref>Ariew and Garber 117, Loemker \u00a746, W II.5. On Leibniz and physics, see the chapter by Garber in Jolley (1995) and Wilson (1989).</ref>\n\nUntil the discovery of subatomic particles and the [[quantum mechanics]] governing them, many of Leibniz's speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense. For instance, he anticipated [[Albert Einstein]] by arguing, against Newton, that [[space]], time and motion are relative, not absolute: \"As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions.\"<ref>See H. G. Alexander, ed., ''The [[Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence]]'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, pp. 25\u201326.</ref>\n\nLeibniz held a [[Relational theory|relationist]] notion of space and time, against Newton's substantivalist views.<ref>Futch, Michael.  ''Leibniz's Metaphysics of Time and Space''. New York: Springer, 2008.</ref><ref>Ray, Christopher. ''Time, Space and Philosophy''. London: Routledge, 1991.</ref><ref>Rickles, Dean. ''Symmetry, Structure and Spacetime''. Oxford: Elsevier, 2008.</ref> According to Newton's substantivalism, space and time are entities in their own right, existing independently of things. Leibniz's relationism, on the other hand, describes [[space and time]] as systems of relations that exist between objects. The rise of [[general relativity]] and subsequent work in the [[history of physics]] has put Leibniz's stance in a more favorable light.\n\nOne of Leibniz's projects was to recast Newton's theory as a [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation|vortex theory]].<ref name=\"Arthur p. 56\">Arthur 2014, p. 56.</ref> However, his project went beyond vortex theory, since at its heart there was an attempt to explain one of the most difficult problems in physics, that of the origin of the [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion of matter]].<ref name=\"Arthur p. 56\"/>\n\nThe [[principle of sufficient reason]] has been invoked in recent [[cosmology]], and his [[identity of indiscernibles]] in quantum mechanics, a field some even credit him with having anticipated in some sense. Those who advocate [[digital philosophy]], a recent direction in cosmology, claim Leibniz as a precursor. In addition to his theories about the nature of reality, Leibniz's contributions to the development of calculus have also had a major impact on physics.\n\n====The ''vis viva''====\nLeibniz's ''[[vis viva]]'' (Latin for \"living force\") is {{math|{{var|m}}{{var|v}}{{sup|2}}}}, twice the modern [[kinetic energy]]. He realized that the total energy would be conserved in certain mechanical systems, so he considered it an innate motive characteristic of matter.<ref>See Ariew and Garber 155\u201386, Loemker \u00a7\u00a753\u201355, W II.6\u20137a</ref> Here too his thinking gave rise to another regrettable nationalistic dispute. His ''vis viva'' was seen as rivaling the [[conservation of momentum]] championed by Newton in England and by [[Descartes]] in France; hence [[academics]] in those countries tended to neglect Leibniz's idea. In reality, both energy and [[momentum]] are conserved, so the two approaches are equally valid.\n\n===Other natural science===\nBy proposing that the earth has a molten core, he anticipated modern geology. In [[embryology]], he was a preformationist, but also proposed that organisms are the outcome of a combination of an infinite number of possible microstructures and of their powers. In the [[life sciences]] and [[paleontology]], he revealed an amazing transformist intuition, fueled by his study of comparative anatomy and fossils. One of his principal works on this subject, ''[[Protogaea]]'', unpublished in his lifetime, has recently been published in English for the first time. He worked out a primal [[organismic theory]].<ref>On Leibniz and biology, see Loemker (1969a: VIII).</ref> In medicine, he exhorted the physicians of his time\u2014with some results\u2014to ground their theories in detailed comparative observations and verified experiments, and to distinguish firmly scientific and metaphysical points of view.\n\n===Psychology===\nPsychology had been a central interest of Leibniz.<ref>L.

His discussions in the ''New Essays'' and ''Monadology'' often rely on everyday observations such as the behaviour of a dog or the noise of the sea, and he develops intuitive analogies (the synchronous running of clocks or the balance spring of a clock). He also devised postulates and principles that apply to psychology: the continuum of the unnoticed ''petite perceptions'' to the distinct, self-aware [[apperception]], and [[psychophysical parallelism]] from the point of view of causality and of purpose:  \u201cSouls act according to the laws of final causes, through aspirations, ends and means.

Wundt used the \"\u2026 nisi intellectu ipse\" quotation 1862 on the title page of his ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung'' (Contributions on the Theory of Sensory Perception) and published a detailed and aspiring monograph on Leibniz<ref>Wundt: ''Leibniz zu seinem zweihundertj\u00e4hrigen Todestag, 14.

He worked to set up a coherent medical training program, oriented towards public health and preventive measures. In economic policy, he proposed tax reforms and a national insurance program, and discussed the [[balance of trade]]. He even proposed something akin to what much later emerged as [[game theory]]. In sociology he laid the ground for [[communication theory]].\n\n===Technology===\nIn 1906, Garland published a volume of Leibniz's writings bearing on his many practical inventions and engineering work. To date, few of these writings have been translated into English. Nevertheless, it is well understood that Leibniz was a serious inventor, engineer, and applied scientist, with great respect for practical life. Following the motto ''theoria cum praxi'', he urged that theory be combined with practical application, and thus has been claimed as the father of [[applied science]]. He designed wind-driven propellers and water pumps, mining machines to extract ore, hydraulic presses, lamps, submarines, clocks, etc. With [[Denis Papin]], he invented a [[steam engine]]. He even proposed a method for desalinating water. From 1680 to 1685, he struggled to overcome the chronic flooding that afflicted the ducal silver mines in the [[Harz Mountains]], but did not succeed.<ref>Aiton (1985), 107\u2013114, 136</ref>\n\n====Computation====\nLeibniz may have been the first computer scientist and information theorist.<ref>Davis (2000) discusses Leibniz's prophetic role in the emergence of calculating machines and of formal languages.</ref> Early in life, he documented the [[binary numeral system]] ([[radix|base]] 2), then revisited that system throughout his career.<ref>See Couturat (1901): 473\u2013478.</ref> While Leibniz was examining other cultures to compare his metaphysical views, he encountered an ancient Chinese book ''[[I Ching]]''.

His [[calculus ratiocinator]] anticipated aspects of the [[universal Turing machine]]. In 1961, [[Norbert Wiener]] suggested that Leibniz should be considered the patron saint of [[cybernetics]].<ref>Wiener, N., ''Cybernetics'' (2nd edition with revisions and two additional chapters), The MIT Press and Wiley, New York, 1961, p. 12.</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Leibniz began to invent a machine that could execute all four arithmetic operations, gradually improving it over a number of years. This \"[[stepped reckoner]]\" attracted fair attention and was the basis of his election to the [[Royal Society]] in 1673. A number of such machines were made during his years in [[Hanover]] by a craftsman working under his supervision. They were not an unambiguous success because they did not fully mechanize the [[Carry (arithmetic)|carry operation]]. Couturat reported finding an unpublished note by Leibniz, dated 1674, describing a machine capable of performing some algebraic operations.<ref>Couturat (1901), 115</ref> Leibniz also devised a (now reproduced) cipher machine, recovered by [[Nicholas Rescher]] in 2010.<ref>See N. Rescher, ''Leibniz and Cryptography'' (Pittsburgh, University Library Systems, University of Pittsburgh, 2012).</ref> In 1693, Leibniz described a design of a machine which could, in theory, integrate differential equations, which he called \"integraph\".<ref>[http://amatterofmind.org/Pierres_PDFs/TRANSLATIONS/4._GOTTFRIED_LEIBNIZ_SELECTIONS_FROM_ACTA_ERUDITORUM.pdf  \"The discoveries of principle of the calculus in Acta Eruditorum\"] (commentary, pp. 60\u201361), translated by Pierre Beaudry, amatterofmind.org, Leesburg, Va., September 2000. (pdf)</ref>\n\nLeibniz was groping towards hardware and software concepts worked out much later by [[Charles Babbage]] and [[Ada Lovelace]]. In 1679, while mulling over his binary arithmetic, Leibniz imagined a machine in which binary numbers were represented by marbles, governed by a rudimentary sort of punched cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/discourse/schirrmacher_eurotech.html|title=The Reality Club: Wake Up Call for Europe Tech|website=www.edge.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Agarwal|first1=Ravi P|last2=Sen|first2=Syamal K|title=Creators of Mathematical and Computational Sciences|date=2014|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=978-3-319-10870-4|page=28}}</ref> Modern electronic digital computers replace Leibniz's marbles moving by gravity with shift registers, voltage gradients, and pulses of electrons, but otherwise they run roughly as Leibniz envisioned in 1679.\n\n===Librarian===\nLater in Leibniz\u2019s career (after the death of von Boinburg), Leibniz moved to Paris and accepted a position as a librarian in the Hanoverian court of Johann Friedrich, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg. Leibniz\u2019s predecessor, Tobias Fleischer, had already created a cataloging system for the Duke\u2019s library but it was a clumsy attempt. At this library, Leibniz focused more on advancing the library than on the cataloging. For instance, within a month of taking the new position, he developed a comprehensive plan to expand the library. He was one of the first to consider developing a core collection for a library and felt \u201cthat a library for display and ostentation is a luxury and indeed superfluous, but a well-stocked and organized library is important and useful for all areas of human endeavor and is to be regarded on the same level as schools and churches\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">Schulte-Albert, H. (1971). Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Library Classification. The Journal of Library History (1966\u20131972), 6(2), 133\u2013152. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/25540286</ref> Unfortunately, Leibniz lacked the funds to develop the library in this manner. After working at this library, by the end of 1690 Leibnez was appointed as privy-councilor and librarian of the Bibliotheca Augusta at Wolfenbuettel. It was an extensive library with at least 25,946 printed volumes.<ref name=\":0\" /> At this library, Leibniz sought to improve the catalog. He was not allowed to make complete changes to the existing closed catalog, but was allowed to improve upon it so he started on that task immediately. He created an alphabetical author catalog and had also created other cataloging methods that were not implemented. While serving as librarian of the ducal libraries in [[Hanover]] and [[Wolfenbuettel]], Leibniz effectively became one of the founders of [[library science]]. He also designed a book [[library classification|indexing system]] in ignorance of the only other such system then extant, that of the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]]. He also called on publishers to distribute abstracts of all new titles they produced each year, in a standard form that would facilitate indexing. He hoped that this abstracting project would eventually include everything printed from his day back to [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]. Neither proposal met with success at the time, but something like them became standard practice among English language publishers during the 20th century, under the aegis of the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[British Library]].\n\nHe called for the creation of an [[empirical]] [[database]] as a way to further all sciences. His ''[[characteristica universalis]]'', [[calculus ratiocinator]], and a \"community of minds\"\u2014intended, among other things, to bring political and religious unity to Europe\u2014can be seen as distant unwitting anticipations of artificial languages (e.g., [[Esperanto]] and its rivals), [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], even the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n===Advocate of scientific societies===\nLeibniz emphasized that research was a collaborative endeavor. Hence he warmly advocated the formation of national scientific societies along the lines of the [[Royal Society|British Royal Society]] and the French Academie Royale des Sciences. More specifically, in his correspondence and travels he urged the creation of such societies in Dresden, [[Saint Petersburg]], Vienna, and Berlin. Only one such project came to fruition; in 1700, the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] was created. Leibniz drew up its first statutes, and served as its first President for the remainder of his life. That Academy evolved into the German Academy of Sciences, the publisher of the ongoing critical edition of his works.<ref>On Leibniz's projects for scientific societies, see Couturat (1901), App. IV.</ref>\n\n==Lawyer and moralist==\nWith the possible exception of [[Marcus Aurelius]], no philosopher has ever had as much experience with practical affairs of state as Leibniz. Leibniz's writings on law, ethics, and politics<ref>See, for example, Ariew and Garber 19, 94, 111, 193; Riley 1988; Loemker \u00a7\u00a72, 7, 20, 29, 44, 59, 62, 65; W I.1, IV.1\u20133</ref> were long overlooked by English-speaking scholars, but this has changed of late.<ref>See (in order of difficulty) Jolley (2005: chpt. 7), Gregory Brown's chapter in Jolley (1995), Hostler (1975), and Riley (1996).</ref>\n\nWhile Leibniz was no apologist for [[absolute monarchy]] like [[Hobbes]], or for tyranny in any form, neither did he echo the political and constitutional views of his contemporary [[John Locke]], views invoked in support of liberalism, in 18th-century America and later elsewhere. The following excerpt from a 1695 letter to Baron J. C. Boyneburg's son Philipp is very revealing of Leibniz's political sentiments:\n\n<blockquote>As for&nbsp;... the great question of the power of sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that it would be good for princes to be persuaded that their people have the right to resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of [[Grotius]], that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.<ref>Loemker: 59, fn 16. Translation revised.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1677, Leibniz called for a European confederation, governed by a council or senate, whose members would represent entire nations and would be free to vote their consciences;<ref>Loemker: 58, fn 9</ref> this is sometimes considered an anticipation of the [[European Union]]. He believed that Europe would adopt a uniform religion. He reiterated these proposals in 1715.\n\nBut at the same time, he arrived to propose an interreligious and multicultural project to create a universal system of justice, which required from him a broad interdisciplinary perspective. In order to propose it, he combined linguistics, especially sinology, moral and law philosophy, management, economics, and politics.<ref>See Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s-Gallego: 42. \u201cAre Humanism and Mixed Methods Related?

In this respect, he followed the example of his early patrons, Baron von Boyneburg and the Duke [[John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|John Frederick]]\u2014both cradle Lutherans who converted to Catholicism as adults\u2014who did what they could to encourage the reunion of the two faiths, and who warmly welcomed such endeavors by others. (The House of [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Brunswick]] remained Lutheran because the Duke's children did not follow their father.) These efforts included corresponding with the French bishop [[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet]], and involved Leibniz in some theological controversy. He evidently thought that the thoroughgoing application of reason would suffice to heal the breach caused by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].\n\n==Philologist==\nLeibniz the [[philologist]] was an avid student of languages, eagerly latching on to any information about vocabulary and grammar that came his way. He refuted the belief, widely held by Christian scholars in his day, that [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] was the primeval language of the human race. He also refuted the argument, advanced by Swedish scholars in his day, that a form of proto-[[Swedish language|Swedish]] was the ancestor of the [[Germanic languages]]. He puzzled over the origins of the [[Slavic languages]] and was fascinated by [[classical Chinese]]. Leibniz was also an expert in the [[Sanskrit]] language.<ref name=\"Springer, Cham\"/>\n\nHe published the ''princeps editio'' (first modern edition) of the [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] ''[[Chronicon Holtzatiae]]'', a Latin chronicle of the [[County of Holstein]].\n\n==Sinophile==\n[[File:Diagram of I Ching hexagrams owned by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1701.jpg|thumb|right|A diagram of ''[[I Ching]]'' hexagrams sent to Leibniz from [[Joachim Bouvet]]. The Arabic numerals were added by Leibniz.<ref>Perkins (2004), 117</ref>]]\nLeibniz was perhaps the first major European intellectual to take a close interest in Chinese civilization, which he knew by corresponding with, and reading other works by, European Christian missionaries posted in China. Having read ''[[Confucius]] Sinarum Philosophus'' on the first year of its publication,<ref name=\"Mungello\">{{cite journal |last1=Mungello|first1=David E. |year= 1971|title=Leibniz's Interpretation of Neo-Confucianism|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3\u201322 |doi=10.2307/1397760|jstor=1397760 }}</ref> he concluded that Europeans could learn much from the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ethical tradition. He mulled over the possibility that the [[Chinese character]]s were an unwitting form of his [[Characteristica universalis|universal characteristic]]. He noted with fascination how the ''[[I Ching]]'' hexagrams correspond to the [[binary numbers]] from 000000 to 111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical mathematics he admired.<ref>On Leibniz, the ''I Ching'', and binary numbers, see Aiton (1985: 245\u2013248). Leibniz's writings on Chinese civilization are collected and translated in Cook and Rosemont (1994), and discussed in Perkins (2004).</ref> Leibniz communicated his ideas of the binary system representing Christianity to the Emperor of China hoping it would convert him.<ref name=\"Springer, Cham\"/> Leibniz may be the only major Western philosopher who attempted to accommodate Confucian ideas to prevailing European beliefs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Daniel|title=Leibniz, China, and the Problem of Pagan Wisdom|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/591609|website=Project Muse|publisher=Project Muse|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nLeibniz's attraction to [[Chinese philosophy]] originates from his perception that Chinese philosophy was similar to his own.<ref name=\"Mungello\"/> The historian E.R. Hughes suggests that Leibniz's ideas of \"simple substance\" and \"pre-established harmony\" were directly influenced by [[Confucianism]], pointing to the fact that they were conceived during the period that he was reading ''Confucius Sinarum Philosophus''.<ref name=\"Mungello\"/>\n\n== As polymath ==\nWhile making his grand tour of European archives to research the Brunswick family history that he never completed, Leibniz stopped in [[Vienna]] between May 1688 and February 1689, where he did much legal and diplomatic work for the Brunswicks. He visited mines, talked with mine engineers, and tried to negotiate export contracts for lead from the ducal mines in the [[Harz mountains]]. His proposal that the streets of Vienna be lit with lamps burning [[rapeseed oil]] was implemented. During a formal audience with the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Austrian Emperor]] and in subsequent memoranda, he advocated reorganizing the Austrian economy, reforming the coinage of much of central Europe, negotiating a [[Concordat]] between the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and creating an imperial research library, official archive, and public insurance fund. He wrote and published an important paper on [[mechanics]].\n\nLeibniz also wrote a short paper, ''Primae veritates'', first published by [[Louis Couturat]] in 1903 (pp.&nbsp;518\u2013523)<ref>Later translated as Loemker 267 and Woolhouse and Francks 30</ref> summarizing his views on [[metaphysics]]. The paper is undated; that he wrote it while in Vienna in 1689 was determined only in 1999, when the ongoing critical edition finally published Leibniz's philosophical writings for the period 1677\u201390.<ref>A VI, 4, n. 324, pp. 1643\u20131649 with the title: ''Principia Logico-Metaphysica''</ref> Couturat's reading of this paper was the launching point for much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]]. But after a meticulous study of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688\u2014a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible\u2014Mercer (2001) begged to differ with Couturat's reading; the jury is still out.\n\n==Posthumous reputation==\n[[File:Leibnizstrasse street sign Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|Leibnizstrasse street sign Berlin]]\n\nWhen Leibniz died, his reputation was in decline. He was remembered for only one book, the ''[[Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e]]'',<ref>{{see also |Irenaean theodicy#Gottfried Leibniz}}</ref> whose supposed central argument [[Voltaire]] lampooned in his popular book ''[[Candide]]'', which concludes with the character Candide saying, \"''[[Non liquet]]''\" (it is not clear), a term that was applied during the Roman Republic to a legal verdict of \"not proven\". Voltaire's depiction of Leibniz's ideas was so influential that many believed it to be an accurate description. Thus Voltaire and his ''Candide'' bear some of the blame for the lingering failure to appreciate and understand Leibniz's ideas. Leibniz had an ardent disciple, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], whose dogmatic and facile outlook did Leibniz's reputation much harm. He also influenced [[David Hume]] who read his ''[[Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e]]'' and used some of his ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v19n1/vasilyeu/vasilyeu-v19n1.pdf|title=Vasilyev, 1993|publisher=}}</ref> In any event, philosophical fashion was moving away from the rationalism and system building of the 17th century, of which Leibniz had been such an ardent proponent. His work on law, diplomacy, and history was seen as of ephemeral interest. The vastness and richness of his correspondence went unrecognized.\n\nMuch of Europe came to doubt that Leibniz had discovered calculus independently of Newton, and hence his whole work in mathematics and physics was neglected. Voltaire, an admirer of Newton, also wrote ''Candide'' at least in part to discredit Leibniz's claim to having discovered calculus and Leibniz's charge that [[Newton's theory of universal gravitation]] was incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nLeibniz's long march to his present glory began with the 1765 publication of the ''Nouveaux Essais'', which [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] read closely. In 1768, [[Louis Dutens]] edited the first multi-volume edition of Leibniz's writings, followed in the 19th century by a number of editions, including those edited by Erdmann, Foucher de Careil, Gerhardt, Gerland, Klopp, and Mollat. Publication of Leibniz's correspondence with notables such as [[Antoine Arnauld]], [[Samuel Clarke]], [[Sophia of Hanover]], and her daughter [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]], began.\n\nIn 1900, [[Bertrand Russell]] published a critical study of Leibniz's [[metaphysics]].<ref>Russell, 1900</ref> Shortly thereafter, [[Louis Couturat]] published an important study of Leibniz, and edited a volume of Leibniz's heretofore unpublished writings, mainly on logic. They made Leibniz somewhat respectable among 20th-century [[analytic philosophy|analytical]] and [[linguistic philosophy|linguistic]] philosophers in the English-speaking world (Leibniz had already been of great influence to many Germans such as [[Bernhard Riemann]]). For example, Leibniz's phrase ''[[salva veritate]]'', meaning interchangeability without loss of or compromising the truth, recurs in [[Willard Quine]]'s writings. Nevertheless, the secondary literature on Leibniz did not really blossom until after World War II. This is especially true of English speaking countries; in Gregory Brown's bibliography fewer than 30 of the English language entries were published before 1946. American Leibniz studies owe much to [[Leroy Loemker]] (1904\u20131985) through his translations and his interpretive essays in LeClerc (1973).\n\n[[Nicholas Jolley]] has surmised that Leibniz's reputation as a philosopher is now perhaps higher than at any time since he was alive.<ref>Jolley, 217\u2013219</ref> Analytic and contemporary philosophy continue to invoke his notions of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[Principle of individuation|individuation]], and [[possible worlds]]. Work in the history of 17th- and 18th-century [[history of ideas|ideas]] has revealed more clearly the 17th-century \"Intellectual Revolution\" that preceded the better-known [[industrial revolution|Industrial]] and commercial revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nIn 1985, the German government created the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize|Leibniz Prize]], offering an annual award of 1.55&nbsp;million [[euro]]s for experimental results and 770,000 euros for theoretical ones. It was the worlds largest prize for scientific achievement prior to the [[Fundamental Physics Prize]].\n\nThe collection of manuscript papers of Leibniz at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Bibliothek \u2013 Nieders\u00e4chische Landesbibliothek were inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2007.<ref name=mow>{{cite web |title= Letters from and to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz within the collection of manuscript papers of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22464&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100719082140/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22464&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 19 July 2010 |date= 16 May 2008 |publisher= UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate= 15 December 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Writings and edition==\nLeibniz mainly wrote in three languages: scholastic [[Latin]], French and German. During his lifetime, he published many pamphlets and scholarly articles, but only two \"philosophical\" books, the ''Combinatorial Art'' and the ''[[Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e]]''. (He published numerous pamphlets, often anonymous, on behalf of the House of [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]], most notably the \"De jure suprematum\" a major consideration of the nature of [[sovereignty]].) One substantial book appeared posthumously, his ''[[Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain]]'', which Leibniz had withheld from publication after the death of [[John Locke]]. Only in 1895, when Bodemann completed his catalogue of Leibniz's manuscripts and correspondence, did the enormous extent of Leibniz's ''[[Nachlass]]'' become clear: about 15,000 letters to more than 1000 recipients plus more than 40,000 other items. Moreover, quite a few of these letters are of essay length. Much of his vast correspondence, especially the letters dated after 1700, remains unpublished, and much of what is published has been so only in recent decades. The amount, variety, and disorder of Leibniz's writings are a predictable result of a situation he described in a letter as follows:\n\n<blockquote>I cannot tell you how extraordinarily distracted and spread out I am. I am trying to find various things in the archives; I look at old papers and hunt up unpublished documents. From these I hope to shed some light on the history of the [House of] Brunswick. I receive and answer a huge number of letters. At the same time, I have so many mathematical results, philosophical thoughts, and other literary innovations that should not be allowed to vanish that I often do not know where to begin.<ref>Letter to [[Vincent Placcius]], 15 September 1695, in [[Louis Dutens]] (ed.), ''Gothofridi Guillemi Leibnitii Opera Omnia'', vol. 6.1, 1768, pp. 59\u201360.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe extant parts of the critical edition<ref name=\"ce\">[http://www.leibniz-edition.de/ www.leibniz-edition.de]. See photograph there.</ref> of Leibniz's writings are organized as follows:\n* Series 1. ''Political, Historical, and General Correspondence''. 25 vols., 1666\u20131706.\n* Series 2. ''Philosophical Correspondence''. 3 vols., 1663\u20131700.\n* Series 3. ''Mathematical, Scientific, and Technical Correspondence''. 8 vols., 1672\u20131698.\n* Series 4.

''Scientific, Medical, and Technical Writings''. 1 vol., 1668\u201376.\n\nThe systematic cataloguing of all of Leibniz's ''Nachlass'' began in 1901. It was hampered by two world wars and decades of German division in two states with the cold war's \"iron curtain\" in between, separating scholars, and also scattering portions of his literary estates. The ambitious project has had to deal with seven languages contained in some 200,000 pages of written and printed paper. In 1985 it was reorganized and included in a joint program of German federal and state (''L\u00e4nder'') academies. Since then the branches in [[Potsdam]], [[M\u00fcnster]], [[Hanover]] and [[Berlin]] have jointly published 57 volumes of the critical edition, with an average of 870 pages, and prepared index and [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] works.\n\n=== Selected works ===\nThe year given is usually that in which the work was completed, not of its eventual publication.\n* 1666 (publ. 1690).

Leibniz was lampooned as Professor Pangloss, described as \"the greatest philosopher of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]\".\n\nLeibniz also appears as one of the main historical figures in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s series of novels ''[[The Baroque Cycle]]''. Stephenson credits readings and discussions concerning Leibniz for inspiring him to write the series.<ref>Stephenson, Neal. \"How the Baroque Cycle Began\" in P.S. of ''[[Quicksilver (novel)|Quicksilver]]'' Perennial ed. 2004.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Mathematics|Information technology}}\n* [[General Leibniz rule]]\n* [[Leibniz Association]]\n* [[Leibniz operator]]\n* [[List of German inventors and discoverers]]\n* [[List of pioneers in computer science]]\n* [[List of things named after Gottfried Leibniz]]\n* ''[[Mathesis universalis]]''\n* [[Scientific revolution]]\n* [[University of Hanover]] (Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover)\n* [[Bartholomew Des Bosses]]\n* [[Joachim Bouvet]]\n* [[Outline of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]\n* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz bibliography]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n===Bibliographies===\n\n* Bodemann, Eduard, ''Die Leibniz-Handschriften der K\u00f6niglichen \u00f6ffentlichen Bibliothek zu Hannover'', 1895, (anastatic reprint: Hildesheim, Georg Olms, 1966). \n* Bodemann, Eduard, ''Der Briefwechsel des Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in der K\u00f6niglichen \u00f6ffentliche Bibliothek zu Hannover'', 1895, (anastatic reprint: Hildesheim, Georg Olms, 1966).  \n* Ravier, \u00c9mile, ''Bibliographie des \u0153uvres de Leibniz'', Paris: Alcan, 1937 (anastatic reprint Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1966).\n* Heinekamp, Albert and Mertens, Marlen.

Ward]] and Gary Jaquet, and first published by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] in 1978.  It borrowed heavily from Ward's earlier product, ''[[Metamorphosis Alpha]]''.<ref>Ward, James M., 'Metamorphosis Alpha.' ''TSR Hobbies, Inc.'' 1976</ref>\n\n==Setting==\n''Gamma World'' takes place in the mid-25th century, more than a century after a second [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] had destroyed human civilization. The war that destroyed civilization in ''Gamma World'' is only vaguely described in most editions of the game, and what details are provided change from version to version:\n* The first two editions place a first nuclear war near the end of the 21st century, with the final war in the years AD 2309-2322, and ascribe the final annihilation to a terrorist group called \"The Apocalypse\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.think-magazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=264:a-brief-history-of-the-future&catid=49:doomsday&Itemid=34|title=Think Magazine -|website=Think Magazine|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> and the ensuing retaliation by surviving factions.\n** Later versions would radically alter the reason for the collapse.\n* The 2000 Alternity version is due to alien arrival and nuclear response.\n* The 2003 d20 Modern iteration is due to rampant use of nanotechnology and AI.\n* The 2010 edition introduces a humorous and radically different backstory that attributes the destruction of civilization to the activation of the [[Large Hadron Collider]], which caused multiple realities to exchange features in an event known as \"The Big Mistake\".\nAll editions, however, agree that the cataclysm destroyed all government and society beyond a village scale, plunging the world into a [[Dark Age]]. In many editions of the game technology is at best quasi-medieval (in the first edition, the [[crossbow]] is described as \"the ultimate weapon\" for most Gamma World societies). Some, such as the 2003 and, to a lesser degree the 2010 edition, feature advanced technology that is well known and often easily available. In contrast, super-science artifacts in earlier editions were risky to use due to the average Gamma World character not knowing how to properly operate such devices, or possibly even what the device is at all. The post-apocalyptic inhabitants of Earth now refer to their planet as \"Gamma World\" (or \"Gamma Terra\" in later editions).\n\nGamma World is a chaotic, dangerous environment that little resembles pre-apocalyptic Earth.  The weapons unleashed during the final war were strong enough to alter coastlines, level cities, and leave large areas of land lethally radioactive.  These future weapons bathed the surviving life of Earth in unspecified forms of [[radiation]] and biochemical agents, producing widespread, permanent mutations among humans, animals, and plants.  As a result, fantastic mutations such as extra limbs, super strength, and psychic powers are relatively common.  (Random tables of such improbable mutations are a hallmark of every edition of ''Gamma World''.)  Many animals and plants are sentient, semi-civilized species competing with surviving humans.  Both humans and non-humans have lost most knowledge of the pre-war humans, whom Gamma World's inhabitants refer to as \"the Ancients\".  The only group with significant knowledge of the Ancients are isolated robots and other artificial intelligences that survived the war\u2014though these machines tend to be damaged, in ill-repair, or hostile to organic beings.\n\n''Gamma World'' [[player character]]s include unmutated humans (referred to as \"Pure Strain Humans\" in most editions), mutated humans, sentient animals or plants, and androids.  Characters explore Ancient ruins and strange post-apocalyptic societies to gain knowledge of the Ancients and social status for themselves.  Common adventure themes involve protecting fragile post-apocalypse societies, retrieving Ancient \"artifacts\" (science fiction gadgetry such as power armor, laser pistols, and anti-grav sleds), or mere survival against the multifarious dangers of the future (such as gun-toting mutant rabbits, rampaging ancient death machines, or other Gamma Worlders bent on mayhem).\n\nA recurrent source of conflict on Gamma World is the rivalry among the \"Cryptic Alliances\", semi-secret societies whose ideological agendas\u2014usually verging on [[monomania]]\u2014often bring them into conflict with the rest of the Gamma World.  For example, the Pure Strain Human \"Knights of Genetic Purity\" seek to exterminate all mutants, while the all-mutant \"Iron Society\" wants to eliminate unmutated humans.  Other rivalries involve attitudes towards Ancient technology, with some Alliances (such as \"The Restorationists\") seeking to rebuild Ancient society, while others (such as \"The Seekers\") want to destroy remaining artifacts.\n\n==System==\nThroughout the game's many editions, ''Gamma World'' has almost always remained strongly compatible with the then-current edition of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (''D&D''). Attribute generation is much the same for instance with a range of 3 to 18, randomly generated by rolling three six-sided dice. The attributes themselves are the same, but with occasional name changes such as Physical Strength instead of Strength and Mental Strength instead of Wisdom. This allows Gamma World and D&D characters to potentially cross over genres.\n\nCharacter generation is mostly random, and features one of the game's most distinctive mechanics, the mutation tables.  Players who choose to play mutants roll [[dice]] to randomly determine their characters' mutations.  All versions of ''Gamma World'' eschew a realistic portrayal of genetic [[mutation]] to one degree or another, instead giving characters fantastic abilities like psychic powers, laser beams, force fields, life draining and others. Other mutations are extensions or extremes of naturally existing features transposed from different species, such as electrical generation, infravision, quills, extra limbs, dual brains, carapaces, gills, etc.  These were offset with defects that also ranged from the fantastical - such as skin that dissolves in water, or a scent that attracts monsters - to the mundane, such as seizures, madness and phobias.\n\nCharacters in most versions of ''Gamma World'' earn [[experience points]] during their adventures, which cause the character's Rank (in some editions, Level) to increase.  Unlike ''D&D'', however, the first two editions of ''Gamma World'' do not use a concept of true level or [[character class]], and increases in Rank do not affect the character's skills or combat abilities.  In fact, in the first three editions of the game, character rank is primarily a measure of the character's social prestige.\n\nThe [[game mechanics]] used for resolving character actions, on the other hand, greatly varied between ''Gamma World'' editions. The first two editions, like the early editions of ''D&D'', depend heavily on matrix-based mechanics, where two factors (one representing the actor or attacker, and one representing the opponent) are cross-referenced on a chart.  For some actions, such as attacks, the number located on the matrix represents a number the acting player must roll.  For other actions (such as determining the result of radiation exposure), the matrix result indicates a non-negotiable result.  ''Gamma'' Worlds first two editions had a variety of specialized matrices for different situations (again, closely resembling ''D&D'').\n\nThe third edition rules replace specialized matrices with the Action Control Table (ACT), a single, color-coded chart that allowed players to determine whether a character action succeeded, and the degree of success, with a single roll.  (The ACT concept is drawn from the ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' game published by TSR shortly before development of ''Gamma World''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s third edition.)  The ACT requires the referee to cross-reference the difficulty of a character action with the ability score used to complete that action, determining which column of the ACT is used for that action.  The character's player then rolls [[percentile dice]]; the result is compared to appropriate column, determining a degree of success or failure and eliminating the need for second result roll (e.g. the damage roll that many games require after a successful combat action).\n\nThe fourth edition was directly compatible with 2nd Edition AD&D with some minor differences in mechanics. The fifth and sixth editions though would relegate Gamma World to that of a Campaign Setting and require the core books to play. 5th uses the Alternity system which is mostly represented in the book but required the core rules in order to resolve some factors. 6th Edition though was fully incomplete on its own and required the d20 Modern rulebook in order to play the game.\n\nThe seventh version uses a streamlined version of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition|D&D 4th edition]]'' mechanics. Character generation choice though was nearly fully removed. Instead of choosing a character class, a player had to roll a twenty-sided die two times and consult an accompanying character origin table. For example, a player might obtain the result \"Radioactive Yeti\" and gain the powers associated with the \"Radioactive\" and \"Yeti\" origins. Attributes, mutations, and skills were also randomly assigned. Two decks of cards comprising the core of a ''[[Collectible Card Game]]'' are included with the game. One deck represented random Alpha Mutations, which could be drawn to gain temporary powers, and the other contained various Omega Tech, powerful technological devices that could possibly backfire on those that used them. Some 4th edition rules enhancements for the setting include new damage types such as \"Radiation\", Gamma World-specific skills, and increased lethality. Despite these differences, it is possible to use characters and monsters from a ''D&D'' game in ''Gamma World'' and vice versa.\n\n==History==\n===First Edition (1978)===\nThe original ''Gamma World'' boxed set (containing a 56-page rulebook, a map of a devastated North America, and dice) was released in 1978.  TSR went on to publish three accessories for the 1st edition of the game:\n\n*GW1, ''[[Legion of Gold]]'' by [[Gary Gygax]], Luke Gygax, and [[Paul Reiche III]]\n*GW2, ''Famine in Far-Go'' by Michael Price\n*''Gamma World [[Gamemaster's screen|Referee's Screen]]''\n\n[[Grenadier Miniatures]] also supported the game, with a line of licensed [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tpope/sol/grenadier/gamma-world.html|title=Grenadier Models: Gamma World|first=Tom|last=Pope|website=Cs.cmu.edu|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt least one other TSR product was announced -- ''Metamorphosis Alpha to Omega'', an adaptation of ''Metamorphosis Alpha's'' campaign setting to ''Gamma World's'' rules (Anon 1981). Work on the adaptation was halted when a 2nd edition of ''Gamma World'' was announced. This was later released as ''Metamorphosis Alpha to Omega'' using the ''Amazing Engine'' Rules.\n\n===Second Edition (1983)===\nThe second edition ''Gamma World'' boxed set (with rules designed by Ward, Jaquet, and [[David James Ritchie]]) was released in 1983. Two modules and two accessories were released for this version:\n\n*GW3, ''The Cleansing War of Garik Blackhand'' by Michael Price & [[Garry Spiegle]]\n*GW4, ''The Mind Masters'' by Philip Taterczynski\n*GWAC1, ''[[Gamma World Referee's Screen and Mini-Module]]''\n*GWAC2, ''Gamma World Character Sheets''\n\nTSR also produced four packs of ''Gamma World'' miniatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tpope/sol/tsr/gamma-world.html|title=TSR: Gamma World|first=Tom|last=Pope|website=Cs.cmu.edu|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> TSR started production on a third adventure module, which was to be assigned the identification code GW5 and had the working title ''Rapture of the Deep''. This module was not published.  However, a 'ghost' Second Edition GW5 ''Rapture of the Deep'' module was produced in 2007.\n\n===Third Edition (1985)===\nThe 3rd edition of ''Gamma World'' was another boxed set, credited to James M. Ward and published in September 1985. It introduced the Action Control Table, a color-coded table used to resolve nearly all actions in the game. (Color-coded tables were something of a trend at TSR in mid-1980s. After 1984's ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' proved the viability of the concept, TSR revised ''Gamma World'', ''[[Star Frontiers]]'', and ''[[Top Secret (role-playing game)|Top Secret]]'' to use similar tables.) Unfortunately for TSR, this version of the rules became notorious for the number of editorial mistakes, including cross-references to rules that didn't appear in the boxed set. The errors were serious enough that TSR published a ''Gamma World Rules Supplement'' containing the \"missing\" rules. The ''Rules Supplement'' was sent to gamers who requested it by mail, and included in reprintings of the boxed set.\n\nThe five modules TSR published for ''Gamma World's'' 3rd edition introduced the setting's first multi-module [[metaplot]], which involved rebuilding an ancient 'sky chariot':\n\n*GW6, ''Alpha Factor'' by Kim Eastland\n*GW7, ''Beta Principle'' by [[Bruce Nesmith]]\n*GW8, ''Gamma Base'' by Kim Eastland\n*GW9, ''Delta Fragment'' by Kim Eastland\n*GW10, ''Epsilon Cyborgs'' by Kim Eastland\n\nTSR dropped the 3rd edition of ''Gamma World'' from its product line before the multi-module storyline could be completed. In 2003 an unofficial conclusion to the series was published under the title GW11 ''Omega Project''.\n\nDespite its editorial issues, the 3rd edition rules were well-received enough to win the 1986/1987 Gamer's Choice Award for \"Best Science-Fiction Roleplaying Game\".\n\n===Fourth Edition (1992)===\nThe 4th edition of ''Gamma World'' was a 192-page softcover book, written by [[Bruce Nesmith]] and [[James M. Ward]], published in May 1992 by TSR.  This version of the game abandoned the 3rd edition's Action Control Table for mechanics resembling ''2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons''.  TSR published five accessories for the 4th edition:\n\n*GWA1, ''Treasures of the Ancients'' by [[Dale \"Slade\" Henson]] ({{ISBN|1-56076-577-1}})\n*GWA2, ''The Overlord of Bonparr'' by Jack A. Barker ({{ISBN|1-56076-599-2}})\n*GWQ1, ''Mutant Master'' by [[Bruce Nesmith]] ({{ISBN|1-56076-411-2}})\n*GWQ2, ''All Animals Are Equal'' by [[Dale \"Slade\" Henson]] ({{ISBN|1-56076-638-7}})\n*GWQ3, ''Home Before the Sky Falls'' by  Tim Beach, Paul Riegel, Drew Bittner, and Kim Eastland ({{ISBN|1-56076-674-3}})\n\nTSR's ''Gamma World'' development team announced at [[Gen Con]] 1993 that no further products would be released for the 4th edition.  They also announced that TSR had restarted development of ''[[Metamorphosis Alpha|Metamorphosis Alpha to Omega]]'', but that the manuscript would be completed using the ''[[Amazing Engine]]'' rules.\n\n===Fifth edition (2000)===\nThe 5th version of ''Gamma World'' was a supplement for the science-fiction game ''[[Alternity]]''. (In a nod to ''Gamma World'''s reputation for being repeatedly revised, the book's back cover states \"That's right, it's the return of the ''Gamma World''\".) The ''Gamma World Campaign Setting'' ({{ISBN|0-7869-1629-X}}) was a 192-page softcover book written by Andy Collins and [[Jeff Grubb]], published in 2000 by [[Wizards of the Coast]] (WOTC), only a month after WOTC announced its cancellation of the ''Alternity'' line.  This version of ''Gamma World'' is unique as the only one not to have accessories or supplements.\n\n===Omega World (2002)===\nIn September 2002, ''Omega World'', a ''[[d20 System]]'' mini-game based on ''Gamma World'' and written by [[Jonathan Tweet]], was published in  ''[[Dungeon magazine|Dungeon]]'' 94/''[[Polyhedron magazine|Polyhedron]]'' 153.  Tweet does not plan any expansions for the game,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathantweet.com/jotgameow-faq.html|title=JoT Game OW-FAQ|website=Jonathantweet.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> although it received a warm reception from ''Gamma World'' fans and players new to the concept alike.\n\n===Sixth Edition (2003)===\nIn November 2002, [[Sword & Sorcery Studios]] (SSS) announced that it had licensed the ''Gamma World'' setting from WOTC in order to produce a sixth version of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingreport.com/article.php?sid=6207|title=Ci siamo spostati!|website=Gamingreport.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> SSS's version of the game, which reached the market in 2003, used the ''[[d20 Modern]]'' system, and mimicked ''D&D'''s \"three core book\" model with three hardcover manuals:\n\n*''Gamma World Player's Handbook'' by Bruce Baugh, Ian Eller, Mikko Rautalahti, and Geoff Skellams\n*''Gamma World Game Master's Guide'' by Bruce Baugh, Werner Hager, Lizard, and Doug Oglesby\n*''Gamma World Mutants and Machines'' by David Bolack, [[Gareth Hanrahan]], Patrick O'Duffy, and Chuck Wendig\n\nSword & Sorcery Studios also published three paperback supplements for the d20 version of ''Gamma World'':\n\n*''Gamma World Beyond the Horizon'' by Ellen Kiley\n*''Gamma World Cryptic Alliances and Unknown Enemies'' by [[Owen K.C. Stephens]], Alejandro Melchor, and Geoff Skellams\n*''Gamma World Out of the Vaults'' by James Maliszewski, [[John Snead]], and Ellen P. Kiley\n\nThis new version of the game presented a more sober and serious approach to the concept of a post-nuclear world, at odds with the more light-hearted and adventurous approach taken by previous editions; it was also the first edition of the game to include fantastical [[nanotechnology]] on a large scale. In August 2005, White Wolf announced that it was reverting the rights to publish ''Gamma World'' products back to Wizards of the Coast, putting the game out of print again.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930022249/http://www.white-wolf.com/swordsorcery/index.php?articleid=276|title=Sword & Sorcery Online|date=30 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> Several critics and fans considered Tweet's ''Omega World'' to be a superior d20 System treatment of the ''Gamma World'' concept.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9821.phtml|title=Review of Gamma World Player's Handbook - RPGnet d20 RPG Game Index|website=Rpg.net|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Seventh Edition (2010)===\nAt the Dungeons & Dragons Experience fan convention in early 2010, Wizards of the Coast announced a new version titled ''D&D Gamma World'', eventually released in October of that year.
