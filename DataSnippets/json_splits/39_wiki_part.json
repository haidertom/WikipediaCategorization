Byzantine governor [[Julian, count of Ceuta|Julian]] (described as ''King of the [[Ghomara people|Ghomara]]''), who was a vassal of the Visigothic kings of Iberia, changed his allegiance after the king [[Roderic]] raped his daughter, and exhorted the Muslims to invade the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Under the leadership of the [[Berber people|Berber]] general [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], the Muslims used Ceuta as a [[staging area|staging ground]] for an assault on the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Iberian Peninsula. After Julian's death, the Berbers took direct control of the city, which the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes resented. They destroyed Ceuta during the [[Kharijite]] rebellion led by [[Maysara al-Matghari]] in 740.\n\n[[File:Interior de los Ba\u00f1os \u00c1rabes de Ceuta.jpg|thumb|130px|left|[[Arab Baths (Ceuta)|Arab Baths of Ceuta]], built between the 11th and 13th centuries.]]\nCeuta lay in ruins until it was resettled in the 9th century by M\u00e2jakas, chief of the Majkasa Berber tribe, who started the short-lived [[Banu Isam]] dynasty.<ref name=\"GibbKramers1994\">{{cite book|author1=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|author2=Johannes Hendrik Kramers|author3=Bernard Lewis |author4=Charles Pellat |author5=Joseph Schacht|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZXrAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 July 2013|year=1994|publisher=Brill|page=690}}</ref> His great-grandson briefly allied his tribe with the [[Idrisid]]s, but the Banu Isam rule ended in 931 when he abdicated in favor of [[Abd ar-Rahman III]], the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph of Cordoba]].

Following this Ceuta and the rest of Muslim Iberia were controlled by successive North African dynasties. Starting in 1084, the [[Almoravid]] [[Berbers]] ruled the region until 1147, when the [[Almohad]]s conquered the land. Apart from [[Ibn Hud]]'s rebellion of 1232, they ruled until the Tunisian [[Hafsid]]s established control. The Hafsids' influence in the west rapidly waned, and Ceuta's inhabitants eventually expelled them in 1249. After this, a period of political instability persisted, under competing interests from the [[Kingdom of Fez]] and the [[Kingdom of Granada]]. The [[Kingdom of Fez]] finally conquered the region in 1387, with assistance from the [[Crown of Aragon]].\n\n===15th to 16th century===\n[[File:Portugal-Porto-Train Station-P1180300 (25264859223).jpg|thumb|left|Prince Henry the Navigator during the [[Conquest of Ceuta]]]]\n\nOn the morning of 21 August 1415, king [[John I of Portugal]] led his sons and their assembled forces in a surprise assault that would come to be known as the [[Conquest of Ceuta]]. The battle was almost anti-climactic, because the 45,000 men who traveled on 200 Portuguese ships caught the defenders of Ceuta off guard and only suffered eight casualties. By nightfall the town was captured. On the morning of August 22, Ceuta was in Portuguese hands.

[[Trans-Saharan trade]] journeyed instead to [[Tangier]]. It was soon realised that without the city of [[Tangier]], possession of Ceuta was worthless. In 1437, [[Illustrious Generation (Portugal)|Duarte's brothers]] [[Henry the Navigator]] and [[Fernando, the Saint Prince]] persuaded him to launch an attack on the [[Marinid]] sultanate. The resulting [[Battle of Tangier (1437)]], led by Henry, was a debacle. In the resulting treaty, Henry promised to deliver Ceuta back to the Marinids in return for allowing the Portuguese army to depart unmolested, which he reneged on.\n[[File:Braun Ceuta UBHD.jpg|thumb|left|1572 depiction of Ceuta]]\nPossession of Ceuta would indirectly lead to further [[History of Portugal (1415\u20131578)|Portuguese expansion]].

Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled [[asbestos]], certain [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], and [[tobacco]] smoke.

Carcinogens may increase the risk of cancer by altering cellular metabolism or damaging [[DNA]] directly in [[cell (biology)|cells]], which interferes with [[biology|biological]] processes, and induces the uncontrolled, malignant division, ultimately leading to the formation of tumors. Usually, severe DNA damage leads to programmed cell death, but if the programmed cell death pathway is damaged, then the cell cannot prevent itself from becoming a cancer cell.\n\nThere are many natural carcinogens. [[Aflatoxin]] B<sub>1</sub>, which is produced by the [[fungus]] ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' growing on stored [[cereal|grains]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] and [[peanut butter]], is an example of a potent, naturally occurring [[microbe|microbial]] carcinogen. Certain viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] and [[human papilloma virus]] have been found to cause cancer in humans. The first one shown to cause cancer in animals is [[Rous sarcoma virus]], discovered in 1910 by [[Peyton Rous]].

[[Vinyl chloride]], from which [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] is manufactured, is a carcinogen and thus a hazard in PVC production.\n\n[[Co-carcinogen]]s are chemicals that do not necessarily cause cancer on their own, but promote the activity of other carcinogens in causing cancer.\n\nAfter the carcinogen enters the body, the body makes an attempt to eliminate it through a process called [[biotransformation]]. The purpose of these reactions is to make the carcinogen more [[water-soluble]] so that it can be removed from the body. However, in some cases, these reactions can also convert a less toxic carcinogen into a more toxic carcinogen.\n\nDNA is [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]]; therefore, soluble carbon electrophiles are carcinogenic, because DNA [[nucleophilic attack|attacks]] them. For example, some [[alkene]]s are [[Toxication|toxicated]] by human enzymes to produce an [[Electrophile|electrophilic]] [[epoxide]]. DNA attacks the epoxide, and is bound permanently to it. This is the mechanism behind the carcinogenicity of [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]] in tobacco smoke, other aromatics, aflatoxin and mustard gas.\n\n{{Quote box\n |title = [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] definition\n |quote = '''Carcinogenicity''': Ability or tendency to produce [[cancer]].\n\nNote: In general, polymers are not known as carcinogens or mutagens,<br />however, residual monomers or additives can cause genetic mutations.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Terminology for biorelated polymers and applications (IUPAC Recommendations 2012)|journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|year=2012|volume=84|issue=2|pages=377\u2013410|doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-12-04|url=http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/2012/pdf/8402x0377.pdf|last1=Vert|first1=Michel|last2=Doi|first2=Yoshiharu|last3=Hellwich|first3=Karl-Heinz|last4=Hess|first4=Michael|last5=Hodge|first5=Philip|last6=Kubisa|first6=Przemyslaw|last7=Rinaudo|first7=Marguerite|last8=Schu\u00e9|first8=Fran\u00e7ois}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Radiation ==\n{{Main|radiation-induced cancer}}\n[[CERCLA]] identifies all [[radionuclide]]s as carcinogens, although the nature of the emitted [[Radioactive decay|radiation]] ([[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]], [[gamma ray|gamma]], or [[Neutron radiation|neutron]] and the radioactive strength), its consequent capacity to cause [[ionization]] in tissues, and the magnitude of radiation exposure, determine the potential hazard. Carcinogenicity of radiation depends on the type of radiation, type of exposure, and penetration. For example, [[alpha particle|alpha radiation]] has low penetration and is not a hazard outside the body, but emitters are carcinogenic when inhaled or ingested.  For example, [[Thorotrast]], a (incidentally radioactive) [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] previously used as a [[Radiocontrast|contrast]] medium in [[x-ray]] diagnostics, is a potent human carcinogen known because of its retention within various [[organ (biology)|organs]] and persistent emission of alpha particles.

Dietary increases in total fat or saturated fat result in elevated DCA and LCA in feces and elevated exposure of the colon epithelium to these bile acids.  When the bile acid DCA was added to the standard diet of wild-type mice invasive colon cancer was induced in 56% of the mice after 8 to 10 months.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein C, Holubec H, Bhattacharyya AK, Nguyen H, Payne CM, Zaitlin B, Bernstein H | title = Carcinogenicity of deoxycholate, a secondary bile acid | journal = Archives of Toxicology | volume = 85 | issue = 8 | pages = 863\u201371 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21267546 | pmc = 3149672 | doi = 10.1007/s00204-011-0648-7 }}</ref>  Overall, the available evidence indicates that DCA and LCA are centrally important DNA-damaging carcinogens in colon cancer.\n\n===Stomach cancer===\n[[Stomach cancer]] is the fourth most common cancer [990,000 cases (7.8%), 738,000 deaths (9.7%)].<ref name=Ferlay />  ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection is the main causative factor in stomach cancer.

The altered DNA base can cause errors during DNA replication that have mutagenic and carcinogenic potential.  Thus ''H. pylori''-induced ROS appear to be the major carcinogens in stomach cancer because they cause oxidative DNA damage leading to carcinogenic mutations.  Diet is thought to be a contributing factor in stomach cancer - in Japan where very salty pickled foods are popular, the incidence of stomach cancer is high.  Preserved meat such as bacon, sausages, and ham increases the risk while a diet high in fresh fruit and vegetables may reduce the risk. The risk also increases with age.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/stomach-cancer/about/stomach-cancer-risks-and-causes |title=Stomach cancer risks and causes |work=Cancer Research UK }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{cmn|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Acrylamide]]\n* [[Asian Dust]]\n* [[History of cancer]]\n* [[Industrial Union Department v.

Examples include the [[leopard]]'s spotted coat, the [[battledress]] of a modern [[soldier]], and the [[leaf-mimic katydid]]'s wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast [[disruptive coloration]], eliminating shadow, and [[countershading]]. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the [[bioluminescence|ability to produce light]] is among other things used for [[counter-illumination]] on the undersides of [[cephalopod]]s such as [[squid]]. Some animals, such as [[chameleon]]s and [[octopus]]es, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling. It is possible that some plants use camouflage to evade being eaten by [[herbivore]]s.\n\n[[Military camouflage]] was spurred by the increasing range and accuracy of firearms in the 19th century. In particular the replacement of the inaccurate [[musket]] with the [[rifle]] made personal concealment in battle a survival skill. In the 20th century, military camouflage developed rapidly, especially during the [[First World War]]. On land, artists such as [[Andr\u00e9 Mare]] designed camouflage schemes and observation posts disguised as trees. [[Ship camouflage|At sea]], merchant ships and troop carriers were painted in [[dazzle camouflage|dazzle]] patterns that were highly visible, but designed to confuse enemy submarines as to the target's speed, range, and heading. During and after the [[Second World War]], a variety of camouflage schemes were used for [[aircraft camouflage|aircraft]] and for ground vehicles in different theatres of war. The use of radar since the mid-20th century has largely made camouflage for fixed-wing military aircraft obsolete.\n\nNon-military use of camouflage includes making [[cell site|cell telephone towers]] less obtrusive and helping hunters to approach wary game animals. Patterns derived from military camouflage are frequently used in fashion clothing, exploiting their strong designs and sometimes their symbolism. Camouflage themes recur in modern art, and both figuratively and literally in science fiction and works of literature.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Octopus cyaneain Kona.jpg|thumb|upright|Octopuses like this ''[[Octopus cyanea]]'' can change colour (and shape) for camouflage]]\nIn ancient Greece, [[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BC) commented on the colour-changing abilities, both for camouflage and for [[Signalling theory|signalling]], of [[cephalopod]]s including the octopus, in his ''[[Historia animalium]]'':<ref name=Aristotle>Aristotle (c. 350 BC).

According to [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 theory of [[natural selection]],{{sfn|Darwin|1859}} features such as camouflage [[evolution|evolved]] by providing individual animals with a reproductive advantage, enabling them to leave more offspring, on average, than other members of the same [[species]]. In his ''[[Origin of Species]]'', Darwin wrote:{{sfn|Darwin|1859|page=84}}\n\n{{quote|When we see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the [[red grouse|red-grouse]] the colour of [[Calluna vulgaris|heather]], and the [[black grouse|black-grouse]] that of [[peat]]y earth, we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not destroyed at some period of their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are known to suffer largely from [[birds of prey]]; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey, so much so, that on parts of the Continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the most liable to destruction. Hence I can see no reason to doubt that natural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and constant.{{sfn|Darwin|1859|page=84}}}}\n\n[[File:Variable Protective Resemblance in Lepidopterous Pupae.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Experiment by [[Edward Bagnall Poulton|Poulton]], 1890: [[Ourapteryx sambucaria|swallowtailed moth]] [[pupa]]e with camouflage they acquired as [[larva]]e]]\n\nThe English zoologist [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] studied [[animal coloration]], especially camouflage. In his 1890 book ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', he classified different types such as \"special protective resemblance\" (where an animal looks like another object), or \"general aggressive resemblance\" (where a predator blends in with the background, enabling it to approach prey). His experiments showed that swallowtailed moth [[pupae]] were camouflaged to match the backgrounds on which they were reared as [[larvae]].{{sfn|Poulton|1890|page=111}}{{efn|A letter from [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] to Darwin of March 8, 1868 mentioned such colour change: \"Would you like to see the specimens of pup\u00e6 of butterflies whose colours have changed in accordance with the colour of the surrounding objects?

Leaf [[variegation]] with white spots may serve as camouflage in forest [[understory]] plants, where there is a dappled background; leaf mottling is correlated with closed habitats. Disruptive camouflage would have a clear evolutionary advantage in plants: they would tend to escape from being eaten by [[herbivore]]s. Another possibility is that some plants have leaves differently coloured on upper and lower surfaces or on parts such as veins and stalks to make green-camouflaged insects conspicuous, and thus benefit the plants by favouring the removal of herbivores by carnivores.

The body of a shark or the fuselage of an aircraft is not gradated from light to dark to appear flat when seen from the side.

Some marine animals such as [[jellyfish]] have gelatinous bodies, composed mainly of water; their thick [[Mesoglea|mesogloea]] is acellular and highly transparent. This conveniently makes them [[buoyancy|buoyant]], but it also makes them large for their muscle mass, so they cannot swim fast, making this form of camouflage a costly trade-off with mobility.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190\u2013191}} Gelatinous [[plankton]]ic animals are between 50 and 90 percent transparent. A transparency of 50 percent is enough to make an animal invisible to a predator such as [[cod]] at a depth of {{convert|650|m|ft}}; better transparency is required for invisibility in shallower water, where the light is brighter and predators can see better. For example, a cod can see prey that are 98 percent transparent in optimal lighting in shallow water. Therefore, sufficient transparency for camouflage is more easily achieved in deeper waters.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190\u2013191}}\n\n[[File:Hyalinobatrachium uranoscopum01a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Glass frogs]] like ''[[Hyalinobatrachium uranoscopum]]'' use partial transparency for camouflage in the dim light of the rainforest.]]\nSome tissues such as [[muscle]]s can be made transparent, provided either they are very thin or organised as regular layers or fibrils that are small compared to the wavelength of visible light. A familiar example is the transparency of the lens of the vertebrate [[eye]], which is made of the protein [[crystallin]], and the vertebrate [[cornea]] which is made of the protein [[collagen]].{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190\u2013191}} Other structures cannot be made transparent, notably the [[retina]]s or equivalent light-absorbing structures of eyes \u2013 they must absorb light to be able to function.

In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=192\u2013195}}\n\nIn fish such as the herring which live in shallower water, the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=192\u2013195}} Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The [[cephalopods]], including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=192\u2013195}}\n\n=== Mimesis ===\n{{further|Mimicry|Cryptic aggressive mimicry}}\n\nIn [[Mimesis (biology)|mimesis]] (also called ''masquerade''), the camouflaged object looks like something else which is of no special interest to the observer.<ref name=\"Gullan\">{{cite book |author1=Gullan, P.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, clockmaking flourished. The next development in accuracy occurred after 1656 with the invention of the [[pendulum clock]]. A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The [[electric clock]] was patented in 1840. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all.\n\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s at a particular [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\nThis object can be a [[pendulum]], a [[tuning fork]], a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]], or the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s. \n\nClocks have different ways of displaying time, connected to their internal clockwork type. Analog clocks usually indicate time using angles. Digital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numeric display formats are commonly used on [[Digital data|digital]] clocks: 24-hour notation and 12-hour notation. Most digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays. For convenience, distance, telephony or [[blindness]], auditory clocks present the time as sounds.  There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by using the sense of touch. Some of these are similar to normal analog displays, but are constructed so the hands can be felt without damaging them. The evolution of the technology of clocks continues today. The study of timekeeping is known as [[horology]].\n\n==History==\n{{main article|History of timekeeping devices}}\n\n===Etymology===\nThe word ''clock'' is derived (via Dutch, Northern French, and [[Medieval Latin]]) from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] words ''clagan'' and ''clocca'' meaning \"[[Bell (instrument)|bell]]\".\n\n===Time-measuring devices===\n<!--Linked from [[Template:Time topics]]-->\n\n====Sundials====\n[[File:Garden sundial MN 2007.JPG|thumb|Simple horizontal sundial]]\n{{Main|Sundial}}\nThe apparent position of the [[Sun]] in the sky moves over the course of each day, reflecting the rotation of the [[Earth]]. Shadows cast by stationary objects move correspondingly, so their positions can be used to indicate the time of day. A [[sundial]] shows the time by displaying the position of a shadow on a (usually) flat surface, which has markings that correspond to the hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Sundials Work|url=http://sundialsoc.org.uk/discussions/how-do-sundials-work/|publisher=The British Sundial Society|access-date=10 November 2014}}</ref> Sundials can be horizontal, vertical, or in other orientations.

Sundials continued to be used to monitor the performance of clocks until the [[modern era]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Devices that measure duration, elapsed time and intervals===\n[[File:Wooden hourglass 3.jpg|thumb|upright|The flow of [[sand]] in an [[hourglass]] can be used to keep track of elapsed time.]]\nMany devices can be used to mark passage of time without respect to reference time (time of day, minutes, etc.) and can be useful for measuring duration or intervals. Examples of such duration timers are [[candle clock]]s, [[incense clock]]s and the [[hourglass]]. Both the candle clock and the incense clock work on the same principle wherein the consumption of resources is more or less constant allowing reasonably precise and repeatable estimates of time passages. In the hourglass, fine [[sand]] pouring through a tiny hole at a constant rate indicates an arbitrary, predetermined, passage of time. The resource is not consumed but re-used.\n\n====Water====\n{{main article|Water clock}}\n[[File:SuSongClock1.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[scale model]] of [[Su Song]]'s [[Astronomical]] Clock Tower, built in 11th-century [[Kaifeng]], [[China]].

Some authors, however, write about water clocks appearing as early as 4000 BC in these regions of the world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1958|p=58}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] astronomer [[Andronicus of Cyrrhus]] supervised the construction of the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens in the 1st century B.C.<ref>[http://www.sailingissues.com/yachting-guide/tower-of-winds-1.html Tower of the Winds \u2013 Athens]</ref> The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilizations are credited for initially advancing water clock design to include complex [[gear]]ing, which was connected to fanciful [[automaton|automata]] and also resulted in improved accuracy. These advances were passed on through [[Byzantium]] and [[Islamic]] times, eventually making their way back to [[Europe]]. Independently, the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks\uff08\u6c34\u9418\uff09in 725 A.D., passing their ideas on to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].\n\nSome water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade. [[Pre-modern]] societies do not have the same precise timekeeping requirements that exist in modern [[industrialism|industrial]] societies, where every hour of work or rest is monitored, and work may start or finish at any time regardless of external conditions. Instead, water clocks in ancient societies were used mainly for [[astrology|astrological]] reasons. These early water clocks were calibrated with a [[sundial]]. While never reaching the level of accuracy of a modern timepiece, the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia, until it was replaced by the more accurate [[pendulum clock]] in 17th-century Europe.\n\nIslamic civilization is credited with further advancing the accuracy of clocks with elaborate engineering. In 797 (or possibly 801), the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] of [[Baghdad]], [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented [[Charlemagne]] with an [[Asian Elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] together with a \"particularly elaborate example\" of a water<ref>{{cite book | last = James | first = Peter | title = Ancient Inventions | year = 1995 | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-345-40102-6 | page = 126 | publisher = Ballantine Books}}</ref> clock.\n[[Pope Sylvester II]] introduced clocks to northern and western Europe around 1000AD<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=232}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Al-jazari elephant clock.png|thumb|upright|An [[elephant clock]] in a manuscript by [[Al-Jazari]] (1206 AD) from ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices''.<ref>[[Ibn al-Razzaz Al-Jazari]] (ed. 1974), ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices''.

Existing clock mechanisms that used [[Hydropower|water power]] were being adapted to take their driving power from falling weights. This power was controlled by some form of oscillating mechanism, probably derived from existing bell-ringing or alarm devices. This controlled release of power\u2014the [[escapement]]\u2014marks the beginning of the true mechanical clock, which differed from the previously mentioned cogwheel clocks. [[Verge escapement]] mechanism derived in the surge of true mechanical clocks, which didn't need any kind of fluid power, like water or mercury, to work.\n\nThese mechanical clocks were intended for two main purposes: for signalling and notification (e.g. the timing of services and public events), and for modeling the [[solar system]]. The former purpose is administrative, the latter arises naturally given the scholarly interests in astronomy, science, astrology, and how these subjects integrated with the religious philosophy of the time. The [[astrolabe]] was used both by astronomers and astrologers, and it was natural to apply a clockwork drive to the rotating plate to produce a working model of the solar system.\n\nSimple clocks intended mainly for notification were installed in towers, and did not always require faces or hands. They would have announced the [[canonical hours]] or intervals between set times of prayer. Canonical hours varied in length as the times of sunrise and sunset shifted. The more sophisticated astronomical clocks would have had moving dials or hands, and would have shown the time in various time systems, including [[Hour#Counting from sunset|Italian hours]], canonical hours, and time as measured by astronomers at the time. Both styles of clock started acquiring extravagant features such as [[automata]].\n\nIn 1283, a large clock was installed at [[Dunstable Priory]]; its location above the [[rood screen]] suggests that it was not a water clock.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} In 1292, [[Canterbury Cathedral]] installed a 'great horloge'. Over the next 30 years there are mentions of clocks at a number of ecclesiastical institutions in England, Italy, and France. In 1322, a [[Norwich cathedral astronomical clock|new clock was installed in Norwich]], an expensive replacement for an earlier clock installed in 1273. This had a large (2 metre) astronomical dial with automata and bells.

[[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] invented the [[Escapement#Deadbeat escapement|deadbeat escapement]] for clocks in 1720.\n\n====Marine chronometer====\nA major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship. In 1714, the British government offered large [[longitude prize|financial rewards]] to the value of 20,000 pounds,<ref name=\"Rigden2003\">{{cite book|author=John S.

[[John Harrison]], who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks, later received considerable sums under the Longitude Act.\n\nIn 1735, Harrison built his first chronometer, which he steadily improved on over the next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, including the use of bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat. The chronometer was tested in 1761 by Harrison's son and by the end of 10 weeks the clock was in error by less than 5 seconds.<ref name=gould>{{cite book|author=Gould, Rupert T.|authorlink=Rupert Gould|title=The Marine Chronometer.

The electric clock's mainspring is wound either with an [[electric motor]] or with an [[electromagnet]] and armature. In 1841, he first patented the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] pendulum. By the end of the nineteenth century, the advent of the dry cell battery made it feasible to use electric power in clocks. Spring or weight driven clocks that use electricity, either [[alternating current]] (AC) or [[direct current]] (DC), to rewind the spring or raise the weight of a mechanical clock would be classified as an [[electromechanical clock]]. This classification would also apply to clocks that employ an electrical impulse to propel the pendulum. In electromechanical clocks the electricity serves no time keeping function. These types of clocks were made as individual timepieces but more commonly used in synchronized time installations in schools, businesses, factories, railroads and government facilities as a [[master clock]] and [[slave clocks]].\n\nElectric clocks that are powered from the [[Alternating current|AC]] supply often use [[synchronous motor]]s. The supply current alternates with a frequency of 50&nbsp;[[hertz]] in many countries, and 60&nbsp;hertz in others. The [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] of the motor rotates at a speed that is related to the alternation frequency. Appropriate gearing converts this rotation speed to the correct ones for the hands of the analog clock. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all. Time in these cases is measured in several ways, such as by the alternation of the AC supply, vibration of a [[tuning fork]], the behaviour of [[quartz]] crystals, or the quantum vibrations of atoms. Electronic circuits divide these high-frequency oscillations to slower ones that drive the time display.  Even mechanical clocks have since come to be largely powered by batteries, removing the need for winding.\n\n====Quartz====\nThe [[piezoelectric]] properties of crystalline [[quartz]] were discovered by [[Jacques Curie|Jacques]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in 1880.<ref name=nistrevolution>{{cite web|url= http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/revol.html |title= A Revolution in Timekeeping |accessdate= 30 April 2008 |publisher= NIST| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409174853/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/revol.html | archivedate = April 9, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/curie/pierre.htm |title=Pierre Curie |accessdate=8 April 2008|publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]]}}</ref> The first crystal oscillator was invented in 1917 by [[Alexander M.

Attached to the oscillator is a ''controller'' device, which sustains the oscillator's motion by replacing the energy it loses to [[friction]], and converts its oscillations into a series of pulses. The pulses are then counted by some type of ''counter'', and the number of counts is converted into convenient units, usually seconds, minutes, hours, etc. Finally some kind of ''indicator'' displays the result in human readable form.\n\n===Power source===\n\n[[File:Mainspring wind-up keys.jpg|thumb|left|Keys of various sizes for winding up mainsprings on clocks.]]\n* In mechanical clocks, the power source is typically either a weight suspended from a cord or chain wrapped around a [[pulley]], [[sprocket]] or drum; or a spiral [[Spring (device)|spring]] called a [[mainspring]].  Mechanical clocks must be ''wound'' periodically, usually by turning a knob or key or by pulling on the free end of the chain, to store [[energy]] in the weight or spring to keep the clock running.\n* In [[electric clock]]s, the power source is either a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or the [[Mains power|AC power line]]. In clocks that use AC power, a small [[backup battery]] is often included to keep the clock running if it is unplugged temporarily from the wall or during a power outage.  Battery powered analog wall clocks are available that operate over 15 years between battery changes.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n===Oscillator===\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s repetitively at a precisely constant [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n* In mechanical clocks, this is either a [[pendulum]] or a [[balance wheel]].\n* In some early electronic clocks and watches such as the [[Accutron]], it is a [[tuning fork]].\n* In [[quartz clock]]s and watches, it is a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s, it is the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n* In early mechanical clocks before 1657, it was a crude balance wheel or [[Verge escapement|foliot]] which was not a harmonic oscillator because it lacked a [[balance spring]]. As a result, they were very inaccurate, with errors of perhaps an hour a day.<ref>Milham, 1945, p.85</ref>\nThe advantage of a harmonic oscillator over other forms of oscillator is that it employs [[resonance]] to vibrate at a precise natural [[resonant frequency]] or 'beat' dependent only on its physical characteristics, and resists vibrating at other rates. The possible precision achievable by a harmonic oscillator is measured by a parameter called its [[Q factor|Q]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Quality factor, Q|work=Glossary|publisher=Time and Frequency Division, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)|year=2008|url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|accessdate=2008-06-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160852/http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA44&sig=iBunChocEtJoeKS5p5IgJ1oyl4U Jespersen 1999, p.47-50]</ref> or quality factor, which increases (other things being equal) with its resonant frequency.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riehle|first=Fritz|title=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|publisher=Wiley VCH Verlag & Co.|year=2004|location=Germany|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WZ34pQV-DXMC&pg=PA9&dq=Q+linewidth+%22split+the+line%22|isbn=3-527-40230-6}}</ref> This is why there has been a long term trend toward higher frequency oscillators in clocks. Balance wheels and pendulums always include a means of adjusting the rate of the timepiece. Quartz timepieces sometimes include a rate screw that adjusts a [[capacitor]] for that purpose. Atomic clocks are [[Standard (technical)|primary standards]], and their rate cannot be adjusted.\n\n====Synchronized or slave clocks====\nSome clocks rely for their accuracy on an external oscillator; that is, they are automatically [[Synchronization|synchronized]] to a more accurate clock:\n* [[Slave clock]]s, used in large institutions and schools from the 1860s to the 1970s, kept time with a pendulum, but were wired to a [[master clock]] in the building, and periodically received a signal to synchronize them with the master, often on the hour.<ref>Milham, 1945, p.325-328</ref> Later versions without pendulums were triggered by a pulse from the master clock and certain sequences used to force rapid synchronization following a power failure.\n* [[Electric clock|Synchronous electric clocks]] do not have an internal oscillator, but count cycles of the 50 or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] oscillation of the [[Mains power|AC power line]], which is synchronized by the utility to a precision oscillator. The counting may be done electronically, usually in clocks with digital displays, or, in analog clocks, the AC may drive a [[synchronous motor]] which rotates an exact fraction of a revolution for every cycle of the line voltage, and drives the gear train.  Although changes in the [[Electric grid|grid]] line frequency due to load variations may cause the clock to temporarily gain or lose several seconds during the course of a day, the total number of cycles per 24 hours is maintained extremely accurately by the utility company, so that the clock keeps time accurately over long periods.\n* Computer [[real time clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but can be periodically (usually weekly) synchronized over the [[Internet]] to atomic clocks ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), using the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP). Sometimes computers on a [[local area network]] (LAN) get their time from a single local server which is maintained accurately.\n* [[Radio clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but are periodically synchronized to [[radio time signal|time signals]] transmitted from dedicated [[Radio clock#List of radio time signal stations|standard time radio stations]] or [[satellite navigation]] signals, which are set by [[atomic clock]]s.\n\n===Controller===\nThis has the dual function of keeping the oscillator running by giving it 'pushes' to replace the energy lost to [[friction]], and converting its vibrations into a series of pulses that serve to measure the time.\n* In mechanical clocks, this is the [[escapement]], which gives precise pushes to the swinging pendulum or balance wheel, and releases one gear tooth of the ''escape wheel'' at each swing, allowing all the clock's wheels to move forward a fixed amount with each swing.\n* In electronic clocks this is an [[Electronic oscillator|electronic oscillator circuit]] that gives the vibrating quartz crystal or tuning fork tiny 'pushes', and generates a series of electrical pulses, one for each vibration of the crystal, which is called the [[clock signal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s the controller is an evacuated [[microwave]] [[Cavity resonator|cavity]] attached to a microwave [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] controlled by a [[microprocessor]]. A thin gas of [[caesium]] atoms is released into the cavity where they are exposed to [[microwaves]]. A laser measures how many atoms have absorbed the microwaves, and an electronic [[feedback]] control system called a [[phase-locked loop]] tunes the microwave oscillator until it is at the frequency that causes the atoms to vibrate and absorb the microwaves. Then the microwave signal is divided by [[digital counter]]s to become the [[clock signal]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA61&sig=r7PLMbI4rhAgfGkfBS-MCJEBkVs Jespersen 1999, p.52-62]</ref>\nIn mechanical clocks, the low [[Q factor|Q]] of the balance wheel or pendulum oscillator made them very sensitive to the disturbing effect of the impulses of the escapement, so the escapement had a great effect on the accuracy of the clock, and many escapement designs were tried. The higher Q of resonators in electronic clocks makes them relatively insensitive to the disturbing effects of the drive power, so the driving oscillator circuit is a much less critical component.<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n\n===Counter chain===\nThis counts the pulses and adds them up to get traditional time units of [[second]]s, [[minute]]s, [[hour]]s, etc. It usually has a provision for ''setting'' the clock by manually entering the correct time into the counter.\n* In mechanical clocks this is done mechanically by a [[gear train]], known as the [[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]]. The gear train also has a second function; to transmit mechanical power from the power source to run the oscillator. There is a friction coupling called the 'cannon pinion' between the gears driving the hands and the rest of the clock, allowing the hands to be turned to set the time.<ref>Milham, 1945, p.113</ref>\n* In digital clocks a series of [[integrated circuit]] [[counter (digital)|counters]] or dividers add the pulses up [[Digital data|digitally]], using [[binary numeral system|binary]] logic. Often pushbuttons on the case allow the hour and minute counters to be incremented and decremented to set the time.\n\n===Indicator===\n[[File:Cuckoo strikes the 8th hour.ogv|thumb|right|A [[Cuckoo clock]] with mechanical [[automaton]] and sound producer striking on the 8th hour on the analog dial.]]\nThis displays the count of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. in a human readable form.\n* The earliest mechanical clocks in the 13th century didn't have a visual indicator and signalled the time [[wikt:audible|audibly]] by striking [[bell (instrument)|bells]]. Many clocks to this day are [[striking clock]]s which strike the hour.\n* Analog clocks display time with an analog [[clock face]], which consists of a round dial with the numbers 1 through 12, the hours in the day, around the outside.   The hours are indicated with an [[hour hand]], which makes two revolutions in a day, while the minutes are indicated by a [[Clock face|minute hand]], which makes one revolution per hour.  In mechanical clocks a gear train drives the hands; in electronic clocks the circuit produces pulses every second which drive a [[stepper motor]] and gear train, which move the hands.\n* [[Digital clock]]s display the time in periodically changing [[numerical digit|digits]] on a digital [[display device|display]].  A common misconception is that a digital clock is more accurate than an analog wall clock, but the indicator type is separate and apart from the accuracy of the timing source.\n* [[Talking clock]]s and the [[speaking clock]] services provided by telephone companies speak the time audibly, using either recorded or digitally [[Voice synthesis|synthesized voices]].\n\n==Types==\nClocks can be classified by the type of time display, as well as by the method of timekeeping.\n\n===Time display methods===\n\n====Analog====\n{{See also|Clock face}}\n[[File:Picadillycircuslinearclock.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A linear clock at [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly Circus tube station]].

The standard clock face, known universally throughout the world,  has a short \"hour hand\" which indicates the [[hour]] on a circular dial of 12 [[hour]]s, making two revolutions per day, and a longer \"minute hand\" which indicates the minutes in the current hour on the same dial, which is also divided into 60 minutes. It may also have a \"second hand\" which indicates the [[second]]s in the current minute.    The only other widely used clock face today is the [[24 hour analog dial]],  because of the use of [[24 hour time]] in [[military]] organizations and timetables.  Before the modern clock face was standardized during the [[Industrial Revolution]], many other face designs were used throughout the years, including dials divided into 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours.  During the [[French Revolution]] the French government tried to introduce a [[10-hour clock]], as part of their decimal-based [[metric system]] of measurement, but it didn't catch on.  An Italian 6 hour clock was developed in the 18th century, presumably to save power (a clock or watch striking 24 times uses more power).\n[[File:Rew17h09 1978.jpg|thumb|left|A simple 24 hour clock showing the approximate position of the sun.]]\n\nAnother type of analog clock is the [[sundial]], which tracks the sun continuously, registering the time by the shadow position of its [[gnomon]]. Because the sun does not adjust to daylight saving time, users must add an hour during that time. Corrections must also be made for the [[equation of time]], and for the difference between the longitudes of the sundial and of the central meridian of the [[time zone]] that is being used (i.e. 15 degrees east of the [[prime meridian]] for each hour that the time zone is ahead of [[GMT]]). Sundials use some or part of the 24 hour analog dial. There also exist clocks which use a digital display despite having an analog mechanism\u2014these are commonly referred to as [[flip clock]]s. Alternative systems have been proposed. For example, the \"Twelv\" clock <!-- not a typo, see http://www.gizmag.com/go/6312/ -->indicates the current hour using one of twelve colors, and indicates the minute by showing a proportion of a circular disk, similar to a [[Lunar phase|moon phase]].<ref>\u2022{{US Patent|7079452}}<br />\u2022{{US Patent|7221624}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n====Digital====\n{{main article|Digital clock}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\" caption=\"Examples of digital clocks\">\nKanazawa Station Water Clock.jpg|Digital clock outside [[Kanazawa Station]] displaying the time by controlling valves on a fountain\nDigital-clock-radio-basic hf.jpg|Basic digital clock radio\nCyanogenMod 10 homescreen screenshot.png|[[Android (operating system)|Android]] display with an analog-style clock (albeit generated by a digital computer) in the middle, and a digital-style in the top right corner\nAnalog clock with digital display.png|Diagram of a mechanical digital display of a [[flip clock]]\n</gallery>\n\nDigital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numeric display formats are commonly used on [[Digital data|digital]] clocks:\n* the [[24-hour notation]] with hours ranging 00\u201323;\n* the [[12-hour notation]] with AM/PM indicator, with hours indicated as 12AM, followed by 1AM\u201311AM, followed by 12PM, followed by 1PM\u201311PM (a notation mostly used in domestic environments).\n\nMost digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays; many other display technologies are used as well ([[cathode ray tube]]s, [[nixie tube]]s, etc.). After a reset, battery change or power failure, these clocks without a backup [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[capacitor]] either start counting from 12:00, or stay at 12:00, often with blinking digits indicating that the time needs to be set. Some newer clocks will reset themselves based on radio or Internet [[time server]]s that are tuned to national [[atomic clock]]s. Since the advent of digital clocks in the 1960s, the use of analog clocks has declined significantly.\n\nSome clocks, called '[[flip clock]]s', have digital displays that work mechanically. The digits are painted on sheets of material which are mounted like the pages of a book. Once a minute, a page is turned over to reveal the next digit. These displays are usually easier to read in brightly lit conditions than LCDs or LEDs. Also, they do not go back to 12:00 after a power interruption. Flip clocks generally do not have electronic mechanisms. Usually, they are driven by [[Alternating current|AC]]-[[synchronous motor]]s.\n\n====Hybrid (analog-digital)====\n[[File:Orologio animato in tempo reale con secondi OF.gif|thumb|Hybrid real-time animated clock with seconds (12 hours)]]\nClocks with analog quadrants, with a digital component, usually minutes and hours displayed analogously and seconds displayed in digital mode.\n\n====Auditory====\n{{Main article|Talking clock}}\nFor convenience, distance, telephony or [[blindness]], auditory clocks present the time as sounds. The sound is either spoken [[natural language]], (e.g. \"The time is twelve thirty-five\"), or as auditory codes (e.g. number of sequential bell rings on the hour represents the number of the hour like the bell, [[Big Ben]]). Most telecommunication companies also provide a [[speaking clock]] service as well.\n\n====Word====\n[[File:Word clock wallpaper with comic speech bubble style.png|thumb|Software word clock]]\nWord clocks are clocks that display the time visually using sentences. E.g.: \"It\u2019s about three o\u2019clock.\" These clocks can be implemented in hardware or software.\n\n====Projection====\n{{Main article|Projection clock}}\nSome clocks, usually digital ones, include an optical [[Image projector|projector]] that shines a magnified image of the time display onto a screen or onto a surface such as an indoor ceiling or wall. The digits are large enough to be easily read, without using glasses, by persons with moderately imperfect vision, so the clocks are convenient for use in their bedrooms. Usually, the timekeeping circuitry has a battery as a backup source for an uninterrupted power supply to keep the clock on time, while the projection light only works when the unit is connected to an A.C. supply. Completely battery-powered portable versions resembling [[flashlight]]s are also available.\n\n====Tactile====\nAuditory and projection clocks can be used by people who are blind or have limited vision. There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by using the sense of touch. Some of these are similar to normal analog displays, but are constructed so the hands can be felt without damaging them. Another type is essentially digital, and uses devices that use a code such as [[Braille]] to show the digits so that they can be felt with the fingertips.\n\n====Multi-display====\nSome clocks have several displays driven by a single mechanism, and some others have several completely separate mechanisms in a single case. Clocks in public places often have several faces visible from different directions, so that the clock can be read from anywhere in the vicinity; all the faces show the same time. Other clocks show the current time in several time-zones. Watches that are intended to be carried by travellers often have two displays, one for the local time and the other for the time at home, which is useful for making pre-arranged phone calls. Some [[equation clock]]s have two displays, one showing [[Local mean time|mean time]] and the other [[Solar time#Apparent solar time|solar time]], as would be shown by a sundial. Some clocks have both analog and digital displays. Clocks with Braille displays usually also have conventional digits so they can be read by sighted people.\n\n==Purposes==\n[[File:Robbins NC Clock.jpg|thumb|upright|Many cities and towns traditionally have public clocks in a prominent location, such as a [[town square]] or [[city center]].  This one is on display at the center of the town of [[Robbins, North Carolina]].]]\n[[File:Restoran Pozoj, \u010cakovec - stara ura.jpg|thumb|upright|An old clock in a restaurant in [[Croatia]]]]\nClocks are in homes, offices and many other places; smaller ones ([[watch]]es) are carried on the wrist or in a pocket; larger ones are in public places, e.g. a [[railway station]] or [[Church (building)|church]]. A small clock is often shown in a corner of [[computer display]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and many [[MP3 player]]s.\n\nThe primary purpose of a clock is to ''display'' the time. Clocks may also have the facility to make a loud alert signal at a specified time, typically to waken a sleeper at a preset time; they are referred to as ''alarm clocks''. The alarm may start at a low volume and become louder, or have the facility to be switched off for a few minutes then resume. Alarm clocks with visible indicators are sometimes used to indicate to children too young to read the time that the time for sleep has finished; they are sometimes called ''training clocks''.\n\nA clock mechanism may be used to ''control'' a device according to time, e.g. a [[central heating]] system, a [[VCR]], or a [[time bomb]] (see: [[digital counter]]). Such mechanisms are usually called [[timer]]s. Clock mechanisms are also used to drive devices such as [[Solar tracker#Chronological tracker|solar trackers]] and [[Telescope mount#Equatorial mounts|astronomical telescopes]], which have to turn at accurately controlled speeds to counteract the rotation of the Earth.\n\nMost [[digital computer]]s depend on an internal signal at constant frequency to synchronize processing; this is referred to as a [[clock signal]]. (A few research projects are developing CPUs based on [[asynchronous circuit]]s.) Some equipment, including computers, also maintains time and date for use as required; this is referred to as time-of-day clock, and is distinct from the system clock signal, although possibly based on counting its cycles.\n\nIn Chinese culture, [[Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese#Gifts|giving a clock]] (\u9001\u937e/\u9001\u949f, s\u00f2ng zh\u014dng) is often taboo, especially to the elderly as the term for this act [[Faux pas derived from Chinese pronunciation#Clock|is a homophone]] with the term for the act of attending another's funeral (\u9001\u7d42/\u9001\u7ec8, s\u00f2ngzh\u014dng).<ref name=\"Brown(2006)\">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Ju|title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs|year=2006|pages=57}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Scott D.|title=Chinese business etiquette:: a guide to protocol, manners, and culture in the People's Republic of China|year=1999|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.}}</ref><ref>http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 \u522b\u4eba\u8fc7\u8282\u559c\u5e86\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4e0d\u9001\u949f\u8868\u3002\u9001\u7ec8\u548c\u9001\u949f\u8c10\u97f3\u3002</ref> A UK government official [[Susan Kramer]] gave a watch to [[Taipei]] mayor [[Ko Wen-je]] unaware of such a taboo which resulted in some professional embarrassment and a pursuant apology.<ref>{{cite web|last1=BBC Staff|title=UK minister apologises for Taiwan watch gaffe|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30994307|website=[[BBC]]|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIt is undesirable to give someone a clock or (depending on the region) other timepiece as a gift. Traditional superstitions regard this as counting the seconds to the recipient's death. Another common interpretation of this is that the phrase \"to give a clock\" ({{zh|t=\u9001\u9418|s=\u9001\u949f}}) in Chinese is pronounced \"s\u00f2ng zh\u014dng\" in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], which is a [[homophone]] of a phrase for \"terminating\" or \"attending a funeral\" (both can be written as {{lang|zh|\u9001\u7d42}} (traditional) or {{lang|zh|\u9001\u7ec8}} (simplified)). [[Cantonese people]] consider such a gift as a curse.<ref>Susan Kurth Clot deBroissia [http://www.netique.com/giftsearch/international.html#anchor317728 ''International Gift Giving Protocol'']</ref>\n\nThis homonymic pair works in both Mandarin and Cantonese, although in most parts of China only clocks and large bells, and not watches, are called \"''zhong''\", and watches are commonly given as gifts in China.\n\nHowever, should such a gift be given, the \"unluckiness\" of the gift can be countered by exacting a small monetary payment so the recipient is buying the clock and thereby counteracting the {{lang|zh|'\u9001'}} (\"give\") expression of the phrase.\n\n===Time standards===\n{{Main article|Time standard|Atomic clock}}\nFor some scientific work timing of the utmost accuracy is essential. It is also necessary to have a standard of the maximum accuracy against which working clocks can be calibrated. An ideal clock would give the time to unlimited accuracy, but this is not realisable. Many physical processes, in particular including some [[Electronic transition|transitions]] between atomic [[energy level]]s, occur at exceedingly stable frequency; counting cycles of such a process can give a very accurate and consistent time\u2014clocks which work this way are usually called [[atomic clock]]s. Such clocks are typically large, very expensive, require a controlled environment, and are far more accurate than required for most purposes; they are typically used in a [[Metrology#Laboratories|standards laboratory]].\n\n===Navigation===\nUntil advances in the late twentieth century, [[navigation]] depended on the ability to measure [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. Latitude can be determined through [[celestial navigation]]; the measurement of [[longitude]] requires accurate knowledge of time. This need was a major motivation for the development of accurate mechanical clocks. [[John Harrison]] created the first highly accurate [[marine chronometer]] in the mid-18th century. The [[Noon gun]] in [[Cape Town]] still fires an accurate signal to allow ships to check their [[marine chronometer|chronometers]]. Many buildings near major ports used to have (some still do) a large [[Time ball|ball]] mounted on a tower or mast arranged to drop at a pre-determined time, for the same purpose. While [[satellite navigation]] systems such as the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) require unprecedentedly accurate knowledge of time, this is supplied by equipment on the satellites; vehicles no longer need timekeeping equipment.\n\n==Specific types==\n[[File:Clock sculpture - Drexel University - IMG 7332.JPG|thumb|upright|A monumental conical pendulum clock by [[Eug\u00e8ne Farcot]], 1867.

This is still widely repeated in popular culture today.  But, polygamy was a legitimate Frankish practice at the time and it is unlikely that Charles was considered \"illegitimate\".  It is likely that the interpretation of \"illegitimacy\" derives from the desire of Pepin's first wife [[Plectrude]] to see her progeny as heirs to Pepin's power.<ref name=\"Matthiesen Verlag\">{{cite book|author1-last=Joch|author1-first=Waltraud|title=Legitimit\u00e4t und Integration:  Untersuchungen zu den Anf\u00e4ngen Karl Martells|date=1999|publisher=Matthiesen Verlag|location=Husum, Germany}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news|author1-last=Gerberding|author1-first=Richard A.|title=Review of ''Legitimit\u00e4t und Integration:  Untersuchungen zu den Anf\u00e4ngen Karl Martells'' by Waltraud Joch|date=October 2002|journal=Speculum|volume=77|number=4|pages=1322\u20131323}}</ref>\n\nAfter the reign of [[Dagobert I]] (629\u2013639) the Merovingians effectively ceded power to the Pippinid Mayors of the Palace, who ruled the Frankish realm of [[Austrasia]] in all but name. They controlled the royal treasury, dispensed patronage, and granted land and privileges in the name of the figurehead king. Charles' father, Pepin of Herstal, was able to unite the Frankish realm by conquering [[Neustria]] and [[Burgundy]]. He was the first to call himself Duke and Prince of the Franks, a title later taken up by Charles.\n\n== Contesting for power ==\n[[File:Francia at the death of Pepin of Heristal, 714.jpg|thumb|350px|The Frankish kingdoms at the time of the death of Pepin of Heristal.

This was immediately opposed by the nobles because Theudoald was a child of only eight years of age. To prevent Charles using this unrest to his own advantage, Plectrude had him imprisoned in [[Cologne]], the city which was destined to be her capital. This prevented an uprising on his behalf in [[Austrasia]], but not in [[Neustria]].\n\n=== Civil war of 715\u2013718 ===\n{{Carolingians|315px}}\nPepin's death occasioned open conflict between his heirs and the Neustrian nobles who sought political independence from Austrasian control. In 715, [[Dagobert III]] named [[Ragenfrid]] [[Mayor of the Palace|mayor of their palace]]. On 26 September 715, Ragenfrid's Neustrians met the young Theudoald's forces at the [[Battle of Compiegne]]. Theudoald was defeated and fled back to Cologne.\nBefore the end of the year, Charles Martel had escaped from prison and been acclaimed mayor by the nobles of Austrasia.<ref name=Kurth /> That same year, Dagobert III died and the Neustrians proclaimed [[Chilperic II]], the cloistered son of [[Childeric II]], as king.\n\n==== Battle of Cologne ====\nIn 716, Chilperic and Ragenfrid together led an army into Austrasia intent on seizing the Pippinid wealth at Cologne. The Neustrians allied with another invading force under [[Redbad, King of the Frisians|Radbod, King of the Frisians]] and met Charles in battle near [[Battle of Cologne|Cologne]], which was still held by Plectrude. Charles had little time to gather men, or prepare, and the result was the only defeat of his career. The Frisians held off Charles, while the king and his mayor besieged Plectrude at Cologne, where she bought them off with a substantial portion of Pepin's treasure. Then they withdrew.<ref name=\"Costambeys\">Costambeys, Marios; Matthew Innes & MacLean, Simon (2011) ''The Carolingian World,'' p. 43, Cambridge, GBR: Cambridge University Press, see [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0521563666], accessed 2 August 2015.</ref>\n\n==== Battle of Ambl\u00e8ve ====\nCharles retreated to the hills of the [[Eifel]] to gather men, and train them. Having made the proper preparations, in April 716, he fell upon the triumphant army near [[Malmedy]] as it was returning to its own province. In the ensuing [[Battle of Ambl\u00e8ve]], Martel attacked as the enemy rested at midday. According to one source, he split his forces into several groups which fell at them from many sides.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qluMPHMHPfYC&pg=PA148&q=Battle%20of%20Vincy%2C%20717] Daniel, Gabriel.

In any event, the suddenness of the assault lead them to believe they were facing a much larger host. Many of the enemy fled and Martel's troops gathered the spoils of the camp. Martel's reputation increased considerably as a result, and he attracted more followers.\n\nIn this battle, Charles set a pattern for the remainder of his military career. He appeared ''where'' his enemies least expected him, while they were marching triumphantly home and far outnumbered him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} He also attacked ''when'' least expected, at midday, when armies of that era traditionally were resting. Finally, he attacked them ''how'' they least expected it, by feigning a retreat to draw his opponents into a trap. The feigned retreat, next to unknown in Western Europe at that time\u2014it was a traditionally eastern tactic\u2014required both extraordinary discipline on the part of the troops and exact timing on the part of their commander. The result was an unbroken victory streak that lasted until his death.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==== Battle of Vincy ====\n[[Richard Gerberding]] points out that up to this time, much of Martel's support was probably from his mother's kindred in the lands around Liege. After Ambl\u00e8ve, he seems to have won the backing of the influential [[Willibrord]], founder of the [[Abbey of Echternach]]. The abbey had been built on land donated by Plectrude's mother, [[Irmina of Oeren]], but most of Willibrord's missionary work had been carried out in Frisia. In joining Chilperic and Ragenfrid, Radbod of Frisia sacked Utrecht, burning churches and killing many missionaries. Willibrord and his monks were forced to flee to Echternach. Gerberding suggests that Willibrord had decided that the chances of preserving his life's work were better with a successful field commander like Martel than with Plectrude in Cologne. Willibrord subsequently baptized Martel's son [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]]. Gerberding suggests a likely date of Easter 716.<ref>[http://www.medievalists.net/2014/11/716-crucial-year-charles-martel/ Gerberding, Richard. \"716: A Crucial Year For Charles Martel\", Medievalists.net, November 3, 2014]</ref> Martel also received support from Bishop Pepo of Verdun.\n\nCharles took time to rally more men and prepare. By the following spring, Charles had attracted enough support to invade Neustria. Charles sent an envoy who proposed a secession of hostilities if Chilperic would recognize his rights as mayor of the palace in Austrasia. The refusal was not unexpected but served to impress upon Martel's forces the unreasonableness of the Neustrians. They met near Cambrai at the [[Battle of Vincy]] on 21 March 717. The victorious Martel pursued the fleeing king and mayor to Paris, but as he was not yet prepared to hold the city, he turned back to deal with Plectrude and Cologne. He took the city and dispersed her adherents. Plectrude was allowed to retire to a convent; Theudoald lived to 741 under his uncle's protection, a kindness\u2014unusual for those [[Dark Ages (historiography)|times]], when mercy to a former gaoler, or a potential rival, was rare.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n== Consolidation of power ==\nUpon this success, Martel proclaimed [[Chlothar IV]] king of [[Austrasia]] in opposition to Chilperic and deposed [[Rigobert]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|archbishop of Reims]], replacing him with [[Milo (bishop of Trier)|Milo]], a lifelong supporter.\n\nIn 718, Chilperic responded to Charles' new ascendancy by making an alliance with [[Odo the Great]] (or Eudes, as he is sometimes known), the [[duke of Aquitaine]], who had become independent during the civil war in 715, but was again defeated, at the [[Battle of Soissons (718)|Battle of Soissons]], by Charles.<ref name=\"Strauss\">Strauss, Gustave Louis M.

Soon Clotaire IV died and Odo surrendered King Chilperic in exchange for Martel recognizing his dukedom. Charles recognized Chilperic as king of the Franks in return for legitimate royal affirmation of his own mayoralty over all the kingdoms.\n\n=== Wars of 718\u2013732 ===\n[[File:The Saracen Army outside Paris, 730-32 AD.png|thumb|250px|The Saracen Army outside Paris, 730\u201332, in an early-nineteenth-century depiction by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]]\n\nBetween 718 and 723, Charles secured his power through a series of victories: he won the loyalty of several important bishops and abbots by donating lands and money for the foundation of abbeys, he subjugated [[Bavaria]] and [[Alamannia|Alemannia]]. Having unified the Franks under his banner, Charles was determined to punish the Saxons who had invaded Austrasia. Therefore, late in 718, he laid waste their country to the banks of the [[Weser]], the [[Lippe (district)|Lippe]], and the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]].<ref name=Kurth/> He defeated them in the [[Teutoburg Forest]] and thus secured the borders\u2014in the name of King Clotaire.\n\n[[Redbad, King of the Frisians|Radbod]] died in 719. Charles seized West Frisia without any great resistance on the part of the [[Frisians]], who had been subjects of the Franks but had rebelled upon the death of Pippin. When Chilperic II died the following year (720), Charles appointed as his successor the son of Dagobert III, [[Theuderic IV]], who was still a minor, and who occupied the throne from 720 to 737. Charles was now appointing the kings whom he supposedly served, ''[[Roi fain\u00e9ant|rois fain\u00e9ants]]'' who were mere figureheads; by the end of his reign he didn't appoint one at all. At this time, Charles again marched against the Saxons. Then the Neustrians rebelled under Ragenfrid, who had left the county of Anjou. They were easily defeated (724), but Ragenfrid gave up his sons as hostages in turn for keeping his county. This ended the civil wars of Charles' reign.\n\nThe next six years were devoted in their entirety to assuring Frankish authority over the dependent Germanic tribes. Between 720 and 723, Charles was fighting in Bavaria, where the [[Agilolfings|Agilolfing]] dukes had gradually evolved into independent rulers, recently in alliance with [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand the Lombard]]. He forced the [[Alemanni]] to accompany him, and Duke [[Hugbert of Bavaria|Hugbert]] submitted to Frankish suzerainty. In 725 he brought back the Agilolfing Princess Swanachild as a second wife.\n\nIn 725 and 728, he again entered Bavaria. In 730, he marched against [[Lantfrid]], Duke of Alemannia, who had also become independent, and killed him in battle. He forced the Alemanni capitulation to Frankish suzerainty and did not appoint a successor to Lantfrid. Thus, southern Germany once more became part of the Frankish kingdom, as had northern Germany during the first years of the reign.\n\n== Prelude to Tours ==\n[[File:Age of Caliphs.png|thumb|400px|\"Age of the [[Caliph]]s\": Umayyad dominance stretches from the Middle East to Iberia to include [[Narbonne]]'s port, c. 720]]\n\n=== Lead-up ===\n{{Main|Battle of Toulouse (721)}}\nBy 721, the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba|emir of C\u00f3rdoba]] had built up a strong army from [[Morocco]], [[Yemen]], and [[Syria]] to conquer [[Aquitaine]]. The large duchy in southwest Gaul was nominally under Frankish sovereignty, but in fact was almost independent under [[Odo the Great]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]]. The invading Umayyads besieged Toulouse, then Aquitaine's most important city. Odo, who was not in the city at that time, left to seek help. After Odo's escape the Umayyads had become overconfident and failed to maintain defenses or scout patrols.\n\nReturning three months later, Odo was in time to prevent the city's surrender and defeated the invaders on June 9, 721, at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]]. Odo's forces launched a surprise assault on the Umayyad forces, simultaneously from behind and from within the walls . The surprised besiegers scattered and fled.\n\nBy 730 [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], who had been at Toulouse, was the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba|emir of C\u00f3rdoba]]. The Arab Chronicles make clear he had strongly opposed his predecessor's decision not to secure outer defenses against a relief force, which allowed Odo's force to attack with impunity before the Islamic cavalry could assemble or mount.\n\n=== Raising an army ===\nHistorian [[Paul K. Davis (historian)|Paul K.

Due to the situation in Iberia, Charles believed he needed a full-time army\u2014one he could train intensely\u2014as a core of veteran Franks who would be augmented with the usual conscripts called up in time of war. (During the [[Early Middle Ages]], troops were only available after the crops had been planted and before harvesting time.) To train the kind of infantry that could withstand the Arab heavy cavalry, Charles needed them year-round, and he needed to pay them so their families could buy the food they would have otherwise grown.\n\nTo obtain money he seized church lands and property, and used the funds to pay his soldiers. The same Charles who had secured the support of the ''ecclesia'' by donating land, seized some of it back between 724 and 732. For a time, it looked as though Charles might even be excommunicated for his actions. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} But then came a significant invasion.\n\nThe Umayyads were not aware, at that time, of the true strength of the Franks, or the fact that they were building a disciplined army instead of the typical barbarian hordes that had dominated Europe after Rome's fall. The Arab Chronicles (the history of that age) show that Arab awareness of the Franks as a growing military power came only after the Battle of Tours when the Caliph expressed shock at his army's catastrophic defeat. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Battle of Tours in 732 ==\n{{Main|Battle of Tours}}\n\nIn 731, after defeating the Saxons, Martel, turned his attention to the rival southern realm of Aquitaine, and crossed the Loire, breaking the treaty with Odo. The Franks ransacked Aquitaine twice, and captured [[Bourges]], although Odo retook it. Thus occupied, Odo was unable to come to the assistance of his ally, the Berber rebel Lord Uthman ibn Naissa, who hearing of the oppression of Berbers in North Africa, had negotiated a peace treaty with Odo. After a brief battle, Uthman ibn Naissa was defeated and executed by Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAbdul Rahman next proceeded through Gascony all the way to Bordeaux, capturing the city. Odo engaged Abdul Rahman on the Garonne River at the [[Battle of the River Garonne|Battle of Bordeaux]], but was defeated. The Umayyads looted the rich monasteries of northern Aquitaine before resuming their march towards Tours, a town said to be holding abundant wealth and treasures. This plundering gave Odo enough time to re-organise his Aquitanian troops and warn Charles Martel of the impending danger. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n{{Quote|It was under one of their ablest and most renowned commanders, with a veteran army, and with every apparent advantage of time, place, and circumstance, that the Arabs made their great effort at the conquest of Europe north of the Pyrenees.<ref name=Creasy1862>Edward Shepherd Creasy (1862) ''The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World: From Marathon to Waterloo,'' Ch. 7, p. 138-148, New York, NY, USA: Harper and Brothers, see [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4061/4061-h/4061-h.htm] or [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFdDAQAAMAAJ] or [http://www.standin.se/fifteen07a.htm], all versions accessed 2 August 2015.{{update after|2015|8|3}}</ref>}}\n\nOdo and his remaining Aquitanian nobles formed the right flank of Charles's forces at Tours.

The first, those who believe Gibbon was right in his assessment that Charles saved Christianity and Western civilization by this battle, as typified by Bennett, Paul Davis, Robert Martin, and educator Dexter B. Wakefield, who writes in ''An Islamic Europe?'':\n\n{{quote|A Muslim France? Historically, it nearly happened. But as a result of Charles\u2019 fierce opposition, which ended Muslim advances and set the stage for centuries of war thereafter, Islam moved no farther into Europe.

Certainly all historians agree that no power would have remained in Europe able to halt Islamic expansion had the Franks failed:{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[William E. Watson]] strongly supports Tours as a macrohistorical event, but distances himself from the rhetoric of Gibbon and Drubeck, writing of the battle's importance in Frankish and world history in 1993:\n\n{{quote|There is clearly some justification for ranking Tours-Poitiers among the most significant events in Frankish history when one considers the result of the battle in light of the remarkable record of the successful establishment by Muslims of Islamic political and cultural dominance along the entire eastern and southern rim of the former Christian, Roman world. The rapid Muslim conquest of Palestine, Syria, Egypt and the North African coast all the way to Morocco in the seventh century resulted in the permanent imposition by force of Islamic culture onto a previously Christian and largely non-Arab base. The Visigothic kingdom fell to Muslim conquerors in a single battle at the [[Battle of Guadalete]] on the [[Rio Barbate]] in 711, and the Hispanic Christian population took seven long centuries to regain control of the Iberian Peninsula. The Reconquista, of course, was completed in 1492, only months before Columbus received official backing for his fateful voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Had Charles Martel suffered at Tours-Poitiers the fate of King Roderick at the Rio Barbate, it is doubtful that a \"do-nothing\" sovereign of the Merovingian realm could have later succeeded where his talented major domus had failed. Indeed, as Charles was the progenitor of the Carolingian line of Frankish rulers and grandfather of Charlemagne, one can even say with a degree of certainty that the subsequent history of the West would have proceeded along vastly different currents had \u2018Abd ar-Rahman been victorious at Tours-Poitiers in 732.<ref>Watson, William, E.

This view is typified by Alessandro Barbero, who writes, \"Today, historians tend to play down the significance of the battle of Poitiers, pointing out that the purpose of the Arab force defeated by Charles Martel was not to conquer the Frankish kingdom, but simply to pillage the wealthy monastery of St-Martin of Tours\".<ref>Barbero (2004), p. 10.</ref> Similarly, Toma\u017e Mastnak writes:\n\n{{quote|Modern historians have constructed a myth presenting this victory as having saved Christian Europe from the Muslims. Edward Gibbon, for example, called Charles Martel the savior of Christendom and the battle near Poitiers an encounter that changed the history of the world... This myth has survived well into our own times... Contemporaries of the battle, however, did not overstate its significance. The continuators of Fredegar's chronicle, who probably wrote in the mid-eighth century, pictured the battle as just one of many military encounters between Christians and Saracens\u2014moreover, as only one in a series of wars fought by Frankish princes for booty and territory... One of Fredegar's continuators presented the battle of Poitiers as what it really was: an episode in the struggle between Christian princes as the Carolingians strove to bring Aquitaine under their rule.<ref>Mastnak (2002), pp. 99\u2013100.</ref>}}\n\nHowever, it is vital to note, when assessing Charles Martel's life, that even those historians who dispute the significance of this one battle as the event that saved Christianity, do not dispute that Charles himself had a huge effect on Western European history. Modern military historian [[Victor Davis Hanson]] acknowledges the debate on this battle, citing historians both for and against its macrohistorical placement:\n{{quote|Recent scholars have suggested Poitiers, so poorly recorded in contemporary sources, was a mere raid and thus a construct of western myth-making or that a Muslim victory might have been preferable to continued Frankish dominance. What is clear is that Poitiers marked a general continuance of the successful defense of Europe (from the Muslims). Flush from the victory at Tours, Charles Martel went on to clear southern France from Islamic attackers for decades, unify the warring kingdoms into the foundations of the Carolingian Empire, and ensure ready and reliable troops from local estates.<ref name=Hanson01>Hanson, Victor Davis (2001).</ref>{{rp|167}}}}\n\nIn the modern era, [[Matthew Bennett (historian)|Matthew Bennett]] argues that \"few battles are remembered 1,000 years after they are fought ... but the Battle of Poitiers, (Tours) is an exception ... Charles Martel turned back a Muslim raid that, had it been allowed to continue, might have conquered Gaul.\"<ref name=Bennett05>[[Matthew Bennett (historian)|Matthew Bennett]] (2005) ''Fighting Techniques of the Medieval World.''{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}</ref>\n\n== After Tours ==\n=== Introduction ===\nIn the subsequent decade, Charles led the Frankish army against the eastern duchies, Bavaria and Alemannia, and the southern duchies, [[Aquitaine]] and [[Provence]]. He dealt with the ongoing conflict with the [[Frisia]]ns and [[Saxons]] to his northeast with some success, but full conquest of the Saxons and their incorporation into the Frankish empire would wait for his grandson Charlemagne, primarily because Charles concentrated the bulk of his efforts against Muslim expansion.\n\nSo instead of concentrating on conquest to his east, he continued expanding Frankish authority in the west, and denying the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba a foothold in Europe beyond Al-Andalus. After his victory at Tours, Charles continued on in campaigns in 736 and 737 to drive other Islamic armies from bases in Gaul after they again attempted to expand beyond Al-Andalus.\n\n=== Wars of 732\u2013737 ===\n[[File:Carolus-Martell.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Charles Martel depicted in the French book ''\"Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum\"'' by [[Guillaume Rouill\u00e9]], published in 1553]]\n[[File:Vasconia wide 740 3 - 80.jpg|thumb|250px|Charles Martel's military campaigns in Aquitaine, Septimania and Provence after the Battle of Tour-Poitiers (734\u2013742)]]\n\nBetween his victory of 732 and 735, Charles reorganized the kingdom of [[Burgundy]], replacing the counts and dukes with his loyal supporters, thus strengthening his hold on power. He was forced, by the ventures of [[Bubo, Duke of the Frisians]],  to invade independent-minded Frisia again in 734. In that year, he slew the duke at the [[Battle of the Boarn]]. Charles ordered the Frisian pagan shrines destroyed, and so wholly subjugated the populace that the region was peaceful for twenty years after.\n\nThe dynamic changed in 735 because of the death of Odo the Great, who had been forced to acknowledge, albeit reservedly, the suzerainty of Charles in 719. Though Charles wished to unite the duchy directly to himself and went there to elicit the proper homage of the Aquitainians, the nobility proclaimed Odo's son, [[Hunald I|Hunald I of Aquitaine]], whose dukedom Charles recognized when the Umayyads invaded Provence the next year, and who equally was forced to acknowledge Charles as overlord as he had no hope of holding off the Muslims alone.<ref>Pierre Riche, ''The Carolingians:A Family who forged Europe'', Transl. Michael Idomir Allen, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), p. 44.</ref>\n\nThis naval Arab invasion was headed by Abdul Rahman's son. It landed in [[Narbonne]] in 736 and moved at once to reinforce [[Arles]] and move inland. Charles temporarily put the conflict with Hunald on hold, and descended on the Proven\u00e7al strongholds of the Umayyads. In 736, he retook [[Montfrin]] and [[Avignon]], and Arles and [[Aix-en-Provence]] with the help of [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards]]. [[N\u00eemes]], [[Agde]], and [[B\u00e9ziers]], held by Islam since 725, fell to him and their fortresses were destroyed.\n\nHe crushed one Umayyad army at Arles, as that force sallied out of the city, and then took the city itself by a direct and brutal frontal attack, and burned it to the ground to prevent its use again as a stronghold for Umayyad expansion. He then moved swiftly and defeated a mighty host outside of Narbonne at the River Berre, but failed to take the city. Military historians believe he could have taken it, had he chosen to tie up all his resources to do so\u2014but he believed his life was coming to a close, and he had much work to do to prepare for his sons to take control of the Frankish realm.\n\nA direct frontal assault, such as took Arles, using rope ladders and rams, plus a few catapults, simply was not sufficient to take Narbonne without horrific loss of life for the Franks, troops Charles felt he could not lose. Nor could he spare years to starve the city into submission, years he needed to set up the administration of an empire his heirs would reign over. In addition, he faced strong opposition from regional lords such as the patrician Maurentius, from Marseille, who revolted against the Frankish leader. Moreover, the Aquitanian Duke Hunald threatened his lines of communication with the north, so deciding him to withdraw from Septimania and destroy several strongholds (B\u00e9ziers, Agde, etc.). He left Narbonne therefore, isolated and surrounded, and his son would return to conquer it for the Franks.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Archibald R. |title= The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718\u20131050 |year= 1965 | publisher= University of Texas Press |location=Austin, TX, USA |isbn=978-0-292-72941-4 |page= |url=http://libro.uca.edu/lewis/sfcatsoc.htm |accessdate=}}{{page needed|date=August 2015}}</ref>\n\nNotable about these campaigns was Charles' incorporation, for the first time, of heavy cavalry with stirrups to augment his [[phalanx]]. His ability to coordinate infantry and cavalry veterans was unequaled in that era and enabled him to face superior numbers of invaders, and to decisively defeat them again and again. Some historians believe the Battle against the main Umayyad force at the River Berre, near Narbonne, in particular was as important a victory for Christian Europe as Tours.<ref>See Santosuosso (1993), op. cit. Historian and professor emeritus [[Antonio Santosuosso]], [[University of Western Ontario]] puts forth an opinion on Charles, Tours, and the subsequent campaigns against Rahman's son in 736\u2013737. He presents the case that these later defeats of invading Muslim armies were at least as important as Tours in their defence of Western Christendom and the preservation of [[Western monasticism]], the monasteries of which were the centers of learning which ultimately led Europe out of her [[Middle Ages]]. He also makes the argument that these later incursions were clearly armies of invasion, sent by the Caliph not just to avenge Tours, for the conquest of Christian Europe, with the aim to bring it into the Caliphate.{{synthesis inline|date=August 2015}}</ref>{{rp|TBD}}\n\nFurther, unlike his father at Tours, Rahman's son in 736\u2013737 knew that the Franks were a real power, and that Charles personally was a force to be reckoned with. He had no intention of allowing Charles to catch him unaware and dictate the time and place of battle, as his father had. He concentrated instead on seizing a substantial portion of the coastal plains around [[Narbonne]] in 736 and heavily reinforced [[Arles]] as he advanced inland.\n\nAbdul Rahman's son planned from there to move from city to city, fortifying as they went, and if Charles wished to stop them from making a permanent enclave for expansion of the Caliphate, he would have to come to them, in the open, where, he, unlike his father, would dictate the place of battle. All worked as he had planned, until Charles arrived, albeit more swiftly than the Moors believed he could call up his entire army. Unfortunately for Rahman's son, however, he had overestimated the time it would take Charles to develop heavy cavalry equal to that of the Muslims.\n\nThe Caliphate believed it would take a generation, but Charles managed it in five years. Prepared to face the Frankish phalanx, the Muslims were totally unprepared to face a mixed force of heavy cavalry and infantry in a phalanx. Thus, Charles again halted Muslim expansion into Europe. These defeats, plus those at the hands of [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in Anatolia, were the last great attempt at expansion by the Umayyad Caliphate before the destruction of the dynasty at the [[Battle of the Zab]], and the rending of the Caliphate forever, especially the utter destruction of the Umayyad army at River Berre near Narbonne in 737.\n\n=== Interregnum ===\nIn 737, at the tail end of his campaigning in Provence and [[Septimania]], the king, Theuderic IV, died. Charles, titling himself ''maior domus'' and ''princeps et dux Francorum'', did not appoint a new king and nobody acclaimed one. The throne lay vacant until Charles' death. As the historian [[Charles Oman]] says \"he cared not for name or style so long as the real power was in his hands.\"<ref>Oman, Charles, ''The Dark Ages'', p. 297.</ref>\n\nGibbon has said Charles was \"content with the titles of Mayor or Duke of the Franks, but he deserved to become the father of a line of kings,\" which he did. Gibbon also says of him, \"in the public danger, he was summoned by the voice of his country.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gibbon |first1=Edward |year=1875 |title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.

Though, in 738, he compelled the Saxons of [[Westphalia]] to do him homage and pay tribute, and in 739 checked an uprising in Provence, the rebels being under the leadership of Maurontus. Charles set about integrating the outlying realms of his empire into the Frankish church.\n\nHe erected four dioceses in Bavaria ([[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Regensburg|Regensburg]], [[Prince-Bishopric of Freising|Freising]], and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Passau|Passau]]) and gave them Boniface as [[archbishop]] and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] over all Germany east of the Rhine, with his seat at [[Mainz]]. Boniface had been under his protection from 723 on; indeed the saint himself explained to his old friend, Daniel of Winchester, that without it he could neither administer his church, defend his clergy, nor prevent idolatry. It was Boniface who had defended Charles most stoutly for his deeds in seizing ecclesiastical lands to pay his army in the days leading to Tours, as one doing what he must to defend Christianity.\n\nIn 739, [[Pope Gregory III]] begged Charles for his aid against Liutprand, but Charles was loath to fight his onetime ally and ignored the Papal plea. Nonetheless, the Papal applications for Frankish protection showed how far Charles had come from the days he was tottering on excommunication, and set the stage for his son and grandson to rearrange Italian political boundaries.\n\n== Death and transition in rule ==\n[[File:Charles Martel bad.jpg|thumb|250px|14th-century depiction of the death of Charles Martel]]\nCharles Martel died on October 22, 741, at [[Quierzy|Quierzy-sur-Oise]] in what is today the [[Aisne]] ''[[Departments of France|d\u00e9partement]]'' in the [[Picardy]] region of France. He was buried at [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint Denis Basilica]] in [[Paris]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Monument|url=http://www.saint-denis-basilique.fr/en/Explore/History-of-the-monument|website=BASILIQUE CATH\u00c9DRALE DE SAINT-DENIS|publisher=BASILIQUE CATH\u00c9DRALE DE SAINT-DENIS|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nHis territories had been divided among his adult sons a year earlier: to [[Carloman, son of Charles Martel|Carloman]] he gave Austrasia, Alemannia, and Thuringia, and to [[Pepin the Short|Pippin the Younger]] Neustria, Burgundy, Provence, and Metz and Trier in the \"Mosel duchy\"; [[Grifo]] was given several lands throughout the kingdom, but at a later date, just before Charles died.<ref name=Riche93 />{{rp|50}}\n\nGibbon called him \"the hero of the age\" and declared \"Christendom ... delivered ... by the genius and good fortune of one man, Charles Martel.\"{{cite quote|date=August 2015}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nAt the beginning of Charles Martel's career, he had many internal opponents and felt the need to appoint his own kingly claimant, Clotaire IV. By his end, however, the dynamics of rulership in Francia had changed, no hallowed Meroving was needed, neither for defence nor legitimacy: Charles divided his realm between his sons without opposition (though he ignored his young son [[Bernard, son of Charles Martel|Bernard]]). In between, he strengthened the Frankish state by consistently defeating, through superior generalship, the host of hostile foreign nations which beset it on all sides, including the non-Christian Saxons, whom his grandson Charlemagne would fully subdue, and Moors, whom he halted on a path of continental domination.\n\n[[File:Charles Martel divise le royaume entre P\u00e9pin et Carloman.jpg|thumb|250px|Charles Martel divides the realm between Pepin and Carloman. Grandes Chroniques de France. Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale.]]\nThough he never cared about titles, his son [[Pepin the Short|Pippin]] (Fr.: Pepin) did, and finally asked the [[Pope]] \"who should be King, he who has the title, or he who has the power?\" The Pope, highly dependent on Frankish armies for his independence from Lombard and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] power (the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] still considered himself to be the only legitimate \"[[Roman Emperor]]\", and thus, ruler of all of the provinces of the [[Roman Empire|ancient empire]], whether recognized or not), declared for \"him who had the power\".\n\nDecades later, in 800, Pippin's son [[Charlemagne]] was crowned emperor by the Pope, further extending the principle by delegitimising the nominal authority of the Byzantine Emperor in the Italian peninsula (which had, by then, shrunk to encompass little more than [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]] at best) and ancient Roman Gaul, including the Iberian outposts Charlemagne had established in the ''[[Marca Hispanica]]'' across the [[Pyrenees]], what today forms [[Catalonia]]. In short, though the Byzantine Emperor claimed authority over all the old [[Roman Empire]], as the legitimate \"Roman\" Emperor, it was simply not reality.\n\nThe bulk of the [[Western Roman Empire]] had come under Carolingian rule, the Byzantine Emperor having had almost no authority in the West since the sixth century, though Charlemagne, a consummate politician, preferred to avoid an open breach with Constantinople. Though the sardonic [[Voltaire]] ridiculed its nomenclature, saying that the Holy Roman Empire was \"neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire,\" it constituted an enormous political power for a time, especially under the [[Ottonian dynasty|Saxon]], the [[Salian dynasty|Salian dynasties]], the [[House of Habsburg]], and, to a lesser extent, the [[Hohenstaufen]]. It lasted until 1806. Though his grandson became its first emperor, the \"empire\" such as it was, was largely born during the reign of Charles Martel.\n\nCharles was a brilliant strategic general, who also was a tactical commander ''par excellence'', able in the heat of battle to adapt his plans to his foe's forces and movement\u2014and amazingly, to defeat them repeatedly, especially when, as at Tours, they were far superior in men and weaponry, and at Berre and Narbonne, when they were superior in numbers of fighting men. Charles had the last quality which defines genuine greatness in a military commander: he foresaw the dangers of his foes, and prepared for them with care; he used ground, time, place, and fierce loyalty of his troops to offset his foe's superior weaponry and tactics; third, he adapted, again and again, to the enemy on the battlefield, shifting to compensate for the unforeseen and unforeseeable.\n\nGibbon, whose tribute to Charles has been noted, was not alone among the great mid era historians in fervently praising Charles; Thomas Arnold ranks the victory of Charles Martel even higher than the victory of [[Arminius]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in its impact on all of modern history:\n\n{{quote|Charles Martel's victory at Tours was among those signal deliverances which have affected for centuries the happiness of mankind.|History of the later Roman Commonwealth, vol ii. p. 317.}}\n\n[[File:Charles Martel Saint Denis.jpg|thumb|250px|13th-century tomb of Charles Martel, [[Basilica of St Denis|Basilique Saint-Denis]], created under [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]]<ref>R.E.

Schlegel speaks of this \"mighty victory\" in terms of fervent gratitude, and tells how \"the arm of Charles Martel saved and delivered the Christian nations of the West from the deadly grasp of all-destroying Islam\", and Ranke points out,\n{{quote|as one of the most important epochs in the history of the world, the commencement of the eighth century, when on the one side Mohammedanism threatened to overspread Italy and Gaul, and on the other the ancient idolatry of Saxony and Friesland once more forced its way across the Rhine. In this peril of Christian institutions, a youthful prince of Germanic race, Karl Martell, arose as their champion, maintained them with all the energy which the necessity for self-defence calls forth, and finally extended them into new regions.{{cite quote|date=December 2010}}}}\n\nIn 1922 and 1923, Belgian historian [[Henri Pirenne]] published a series of papers, known collectively as the \"Pirenne Thesis\", which remain influential to this day. Pirenne held that the Roman Empire continued, in the Frankish realms, up until the time of the [[History of Islam|Arab conquests]] in the 7th century. These conquests disrupted Mediterranean trade routes leading to a decline in the European economy. Such continued disruption would have meant complete disaster except for Charles Martel's halting of Islamic expansion into Europe from 732 on. What he managed to preserve led to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], named after him.\n\nProfessor Santosuosso perhaps sums up Charles best when he talks about his coming to the rescue of his Christian allies in Provence, and driving the Muslims back into the Iberian Peninsula forever in the mid and late 730s:\n{{quote|After assembling forces at Saragossa the Muslims entered French territory in 735, crossed the River Rhone and captured and looted Arles. From there they struck into the heart of Provence, ending with the capture of Avignon, despite strong resistance. Islamic forces remained in French territory for about four years, carrying raids to Lyon, Burgundy, and Piedmont. Again Charles Martel came to the rescue, reconquering most of the lost territories in two campaigns in 736 and 739, except for the city of Narbonne, which finally fell in 759. The second (Muslim) expedition was probably more dangerous than the first to Poitiers. Yet its failure (at Charles' hands) put an end to any serious Muslim expedition across the Pyrenees (forever).<ref name=Santosuosso2004 />}}\n\nSkilled as an administrator and ruler, Charles organized what would become the medieval European government: a system of fiefdoms, loyal to barons, counts, dukes and ultimately the King, or in his case, simply ''maior domus'' and princeps et dux Francorum. (\"[[Mayor of the Palace]], [[Duke of the Franks]]\") His close coordination of church with state began the medieval pattern for such government. He created what would become the first western standing army since the fall of Rome by his maintaining a core of loyal veterans around which he organized the normal feudal levies. In essence, he changed Europe from a horde of barbarians fighting with one another, to an organized state.\n\n=== Beginning of the ''Reconquista'' ===\n{{Further|Reconquista}}\nAlthough it took another two decades for the Franks to drive all the Arab garrisons out of [[Septimania]] and across the [[Pyrenees]], Charles Martel's halt of the invasion of French soil turned the tide of Islamic advances, and the unification of the Frankish kingdoms under Charles, his son Pippin the Younger, and his grandson Charlemagne created a western power which prevented the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba from expanding over the Pyrenees. Charles, who in 732 was on the verge of excommunication, instead was recognised by the Church as its paramount defender. [[Pope Gregory II]] wrote to him more than once, asking his protection and aid.<ref>Thatcher, Oliver J. & Edgar Holmes McNeal, eds. (1905) \"Pope Gregory to His Most Excellent Son, Karl, Sub-King\" [\"Pope Gregory II \u2013 Appeal to Charles Martel, 739\"], ''A Source Book for Medieval History,'' p. 102, New York, NY, USA: Scribners, 1905), see [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/g2-martellet.html], accessed 2 August 2015.</ref>\n\nCharles' son [[Pepin the Short|Pippin the Younger]] (Pepin II, The Short) kept his father's promise and returned and took Narbonne by siege in 759. His grandson, [[Charlemagne]], actually established the ''[[Marca Hispanica]]'' across the Pyrenees in part of what today is Catalonia, reconquering [[Girona]] in 785 and [[Barcelona]] in 801. Carolingians called this region of modern-day Spain \"The Moorish Marches\", and saw it as more than a simple check on the Muslims in Hispania.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It formed a permanent buffer zone against Islam and became the basis, along with the efforts of [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelayo]] (Latin: Pelagius) and his descendants, for the [[Reconquista]].\n\n== Military legacy ==\n[[File:StrasbourgCath BasCoteN 10.JPG|thumb|350px|Stained glass window depicting Charles Martel at [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]\n[[Victor Davis Hanson]] argues that Charles Martel launched \"the thousand year struggle\" between [[Europe]]an [[heavy infantry]] and Arab [[cavalry]].<ref name=Hanson01 />{{rp|141\u2013166}} Of course, Charles is also the father of heavy cavalry in Europe, as he integrated heavy armoured cavalry into his forces. This creation of a real army would continue all through his reign, and that of his son, Pepin the Short, until his Grandson, Charlemagne, would possess the world's largest and finest army since the peak of Rome.<ref name=Bennett05 /> Equally, the Muslims used infantry\u2014indeed, at the Battle of Toulouse most of their forces were light infantry. It was not until Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi brought a huge force of Arab and Berber cavalry with him when he assumed the emirate of Al-Andulus that the Muslim forces became primarily cavalry.\n\nCharles' army was the first standing permanent army since the fall of Rome in 476.<ref name=Bennett05 /> At its core was a body of tough, seasoned heavy infantry who displayed exceptional resolution at Tours. The Frankish infantry wore as much as 70 pounds of armour, including their heavy wooden shields with an iron boss. Standing close together, and well disciplined, they were unbreakable at Tours.<ref name=Hanson01 />{{rp|154}} Charles had taken the money and property he had seized from the church and paid local nobles to supply trained ready infantry year round.\n\nThis was the core of veterans who served with him on a permanent basis, and as Hanson says, \"provided a steady supply of dependable troops year around.\"{{cite quote|date=August 2015}} While other Germanic cultures, such as the Visigoths or Vandals, had a proud martial tradition, and the Franks themselves had an annual muster of military aged men, such tribes were only able to field armies around planting and harvest. It was Charles' creation of a system whereby he could call on troops year round that gave the Carolingians the first standing and permanent army since Rome's fall in the west.\n\nCharles Martel's most important military achievement was the victory at Tours. Creasy argues that the Charles victory \"preserved the relics of ancient and the gems of modern civilizations.\" Gibbon called those eight days in 732, the week leading up to Tours, and the battle itself, \"the events that rescued our ancestors of Britain, and our neighbours of Gaul [France], from the civil and religious yoke of the Koran.\"{{cite quote|date=August 2015}}\n\nCharles analysed what would be necessary for him to withstand a larger force and superior technology (the Arab horsemen had adopted the armour and accoutrements of heavy cavalry from the Sassanid warrior class, which made the armored mounted knight possible). Not daring to send his few horsemen against the Islamic cavalry, he had his army fight in a formation used by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] to withstand superior numbers and weapons by discipline, courage, and a willingness to die for their cause: a phalanx. He had trained a core of his men year round, using mostly Church funds, and some had been with him since his earliest days after his father's death. It was this hard core of disciplined veterans that won the day for him at Tours.\n\nHanson emphasizes that Charles' greatest accomplishment as a general may have been his ability to keep his troops under control. Iron discipline saved his infantry from the fate of so many infantrymen\u2014such as the Saxons at Hastings\u2014who broke formation and were slaughtered piecemeal. After using this infantry force by itself at Tours, he studied the foe's forces and further adapted to them, initially using stirrups and saddles recovered from the foe's dead horses, and armour from the dead horsemen.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe defeats Charles inflicted on the Muslims were vital in that the split in the Islamic world left the [[Caliphate]] unable to mount an all-out attack on Europe via its Iberian stronghold after 750. His ability to meet this challenge, until the fragmentation of authority within the Muslim faith, is considered by most historians to be of [[Macrohistory|macrohistorical]] importance, and is why [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] writes of him in Heaven as one of the \"Defenders of the Faith.\"\n\n[[H. G. Wells]] says of Charles Martel's decisive defeat of the Muslims in his \"Short History of the World:\n{{quote|The Muslim when they crossed the Pyrenees in 720 found this Frankish kingdom under the practical rule of Charles Martel, the Mayor of the Palace of a degenerate descendant of Clovis, and experienced the decisive defeat of Poitiers (732) at his hands. This Charles Martel was practically overlord of Europe north of the Alps from the Pyrenees to Hungary.\"<ref>Wells, H.G. (1922) \"The Development of Latin Christendom\" (Ch. 45),\" in ''A Short History of the World,'' [Location:Publisher], see [http://www.bartleby.com/86/45.html], accessed 2 August 2015.</ref>}}\n\nHowever, when the Muslim first crossed the Pyrenees, Aquitaine was actually an independent realm under duke Odo's leadership and the Gothic [[Septimania]] remained out of Frankish rule. Odo, who was Charles's southern rival, had struck a peace treaty after the Frankish civil wars in Neustria and Austrasia, and garnered much popularity and the Pope's favour for his victory on the 721 Battle of Toulouse against the Moors. On the eve of the Muslim expedition north (731), Charles Martel crossed the Loire and captured the Aquitanian city of Bourges, while Odo re-captured it briefly afterwards.\n\n[[John Henry Haaren|John H. Haaren]] says in ''Famous Men of the Middle Ages'':\n{{quote|The battle of Tours, or Poitiers, as it should be called, is regarded as one of the decisive battles of the world. It decided that Christians, and not Moslems, should be the ruling power in Europe. Charles Martel is especially celebrated as the hero of this battle.{{cite quote|date=August 2015}}}}\n\nJust as his grandson, Charlemagne, would become famous for his swift and unexpected movements in his campaigns, Charles was renowned for never doing what his enemies forecast he would do, and for moving far faster than his opponents believed he could. It is notable that the Northmen did not begin their European raids until after the death of Charles' grandson, Charlemagne. They had the naval capacity to begin those raids at least three generations earlier, and constructed defenses against counterattacks by land, but chose not to challenge Charles, his son Pippin, or his grandson, Charlemagne.\n\n== Conclusion ==\n[[John Roberts (historian)|J. M. Roberts]] says of Charles Martel in his note on the Carolingians in his ''History of the World'':<ref>J.M. Roberts (1993) ''History of the World,'' p. 315.</ref>\n\n::It (the Carolingian line) produced Charles Martel, the soldier who turned the Arabs back at Tours, and the supporter of Saint Boniface, the Evangelizer of Germany. This is a considerable double mark to have left on the history of Europe.\"\n\nGibbon perhaps summarized Charles Martel's legacy most eloquently: \"in a laborious administration of 24 years he had restored and supported the dignity of the throne... by the activity of a warrior who in the same campaign could display his banner on the Elbe, the Rhone, and shores of the ocean.\"{{cite quote|date=August 2015}}\n\n== Family and children ==\nCharles Martel married twice, his first wife being [[Rotrude of Hesbaye|Rotrude of Treves]], daughter either of [[Lambert, Count of Hesbaye|Lambert II, Count of Hesbaye]], or of [[Leudwinus]], Count of Treves. They had the following children:\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Hiltrud]],\n* [[Carolman, son of Charles Martel|Carloman]],<ref name=Riche93 />{{rp|50}}\n* Landrade, also rendered Landres,\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Auda of France|Auda]], also called Aldana or Alane, and\n* [[Pepin the Short]], also called Pippin,<ref name=Riche93 />{{rp|50}}\n{{col-end}}\nMost of the children married and had issue. [[Hiltrud]] married [[Odilo, Duke of Bavaria|Odilo I]] (a [[List of rulers of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]). Landrade was once believed to have married a [[Sigramnus, Count of Hesbaye|Sigrand]] (Count of Hesbania) but Sigrand's wife was more likely the sister of Rotrude. [[Auda of France|Auda]] married [[Thierry IV]] (a Count of [[Autun]] and [[Toulouse]]). Charles also married a second time, to [[Swanachild|Swanhild]], and they had a child, [[Grifo]].<ref name=Riche93 />{{rp|50}}\n\nFinally, Charles Martel also had a known mistress, [[Ruodhaid]], with whom he had the children [[Bernard, son of Charles Martel|Bernard]], [[Hieronymus, son of Charles Martel|Hieronymus]], and [[Remigius of Rouen|Remigius]], the latter who became an [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rouen|archbishop of Rouen]].\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsible=yes\n|collapsed=yes\n|align=center\n|ref=\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1=1.

Common examples are earthenware, porcelain, and brick.\n\nThe [[crystallinity]] of ceramic materials ranges from highly oriented to semi-crystalline, [[Vitrification|vitrified]], and often completely [[amorphous]] (e.g., [[glass]]es). Most often, fired ceramics are either vitrified or semi-vitrified as is the case with [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]], and [[porcelain]]. Varying crystallinity and [[electron]] consumption in the ionic and covalent bonds cause most ceramic materials to be good thermal and [[Insulator (electricity)|electrical insulators]] (extensively researched in [[ceramic engineering]]). With such a large range of possible options for the composition/structure of a ceramic (e.g. nearly all of the elements, nearly all types of bonding, and all levels of crystallinity), the breadth of the subject is vast, and identifiable attributes (e.g. [[hardness]], [[toughness]], [[electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]], etc.) are hard to specify for the group as a whole.

The properties of ceramics make fracturing an important inspection method.]]\n\nA ceramic material is an inorganic, non-metallic, often crystalline oxide, nitride or carbide material. Some elements, such as [[carbon]] or [[silicon]], may be considered ceramics. Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, weak in [[shear stress|shearing]] and tension. They withstand chemical erosion that occurs in other materials subjected to acidic or caustic environments. Ceramics generally can withstand very high temperatures, such as temperatures that range from 1,000&nbsp;\u00b0C to 1,600&nbsp;\u00b0C (1,800&nbsp;\u00b0F to 3,000&nbsp;\u00b0F). [[Glass]] is often not considered a ceramic because of its [[amorphous]] (noncrystalline) character. However, glassmaking involves several steps of the ceramic process and its mechanical properties are similar to ceramic materials.\n\nTraditional ceramic raw materials include clay minerals such as [[kaolinite]], whereas more recent materials include aluminium oxide, more commonly known as [[alumina]]. The modern ceramic materials, which are classified as advanced ceramics, include [[silicon carbide]] and [[tungsten carbide]]. Both are valued for their abrasion resistance, and hence find use in applications such as the wear plates of crushing equipment in mining operations. Advanced ceramics are also used in the medicine, electrical, electronics industries and body armor.\n\n===Crystalline ceramics===\nCrystalline ceramic materials are not amenable to a great range of processing. Methods for dealing with them tend to fall into one of two categories \u2013 either make the ceramic in the desired shape, by reaction ''in situ'', or by \"forming\" powders into the desired shape, and then [[sintering]] to form a solid body. [[Ceramic forming techniques]] include shaping by hand (sometimes including a rotation process called \"throwing\"), [[Slipcasting|slip casting]], [[tape casting]] (used for making very thin ceramic capacitors, e.g.), [[injection molding]], dry pressing, and other variations. Details of these processes are described in the two books listed below.{{which|date=December 2012}} A few methods use a hybrid between the two approaches.\n\n===Noncrystalline ceramics===\nNoncrystalline ceramics, being glass, tend to be formed from melts. The glass is shaped when either fully molten, by casting, or when in a state of toffee-like viscosity, by methods such as blowing into a mold. If later heat treatments cause this glass to become partly crystalline, the resulting material is known as a glass-ceramic, widely used as cook-top and also as a glass composite material for nuclear waste disposal.\n\n==Properties of ceramics==\nThe physical properties of any ceramic substance are a direct result of its crystalline structure and chemical composition. [[Solid state chemistry]] reveals the fundamental connection between microstructure and properties such as localized density variations, grain size distribution, type of porosity and second-phase content, which can all be correlated with ceramic properties such as mechanical strength \u03c3 by the Hall-Petch equation, [[hardness]], [[toughness]], [[dielectric constant]], and the [[optical]] properties exhibited by [[transparent materials]].\n\nPhysical properties of chemical compounds which provide evidence of chemical composition include odor, colour, volume, density (mass / volume), melting point, boiling point, heat capacity, physical form at room temperature (solid, liquid or gas), hardness, porosity, and index of refraction.\n\n[[Ceramography]] is the art and science of preparation, examination and evaluation of ceramic microstructures. Evaluation and characterization of ceramic microstructures is often implemented on similar spatial scales to that used commonly in the emerging field of nanotechnology: from tens of [[angstrom]]s (A) to tens of micrometers (\u00b5m). This is typically somewhere between the minimum wavelength of visible light and the resolution limit of the naked eye.\n\nThe microstructure includes most grains, secondary phases, grain boundaries, pores, micro-cracks, structural defects and hardness microindentions. Most bulk mechanical, optical, thermal, electrical and magnetic properties are significantly affected by the observed microstructure. The fabrication method and process conditions are generally indicated by the microstructure. The root cause of many ceramic failures is evident in the cleaved and polished microstructure. Physical properties which constitute the field of [[materials science]] and [[engineering]] include the following:\n\n===Mechanical properties===\n\n[[File:Ultra-thin separated (Carborundum) disk.jpg|thumb|Cutting disks made of [[silicon carbide]]]]\n[[File:PCCB Brake Carrera GT.jpg|thumb|The Porsche Carrera GT's carbon-ceramic (silicon carbide) [[disc brake]]]]\nMechanical properties are important in structural and building materials as well as textile fabrics. They include many properties used to describe the [[strength of materials]] such as: [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] / [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], [[tensile strength]], [[compressive strength]], [[shear strength]], [[fracture toughness]] & [[ductility]] (low in [[brittle]] materials), and [[indentation hardness]].\n\nIn modern [[materials science]], fracture mechanics is an important tool in improving the mechanical performance of materials and components. It applies the [[physics]] of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] and [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]], in particular the theories of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], to the microscopic [[crystallographic defects]] found in real materials in order to predict the macroscopic mechanical failure of bodies. [[Fractography]] is widely used with fracture mechanics to understand the causes of failures and also verify the theoretical [[failure]] predictions with real life failures.\n\nCeramic materials are usually [[ionic bond|ionic]] or [[covalent]] bonded materials, and can be [[crystal]]line or [[amorphous solid|amorphous]]. A material held together by either type of bond will tend to [[Fracture#Brittle fracture|fracture]] before any [[plastic deformation]] takes place, which results in poor [[toughness]] in these materials. Additionally, because these materials tend to be porous, the [[porosity|pore]]s and other microscopic imperfections act as [[Stress concentration|stress concentrators]], decreasing the toughness further, and reducing the [[tensile strength]]. These combine to give [[catastrophic failure]]s, as opposed to the normally much more gentle [[failure mode]]s of metals.\n\nThese materials do show [[plasticity (physics)|plastic deformation]]. However, due to the rigid structure of the crystalline materials, there are very few available [[slip system]]s for [[dislocation]]s to move, and so they deform very slowly. With the non-crystalline (glassy) materials, [[Viscosity|viscous]] flow is the dominant source of plastic deformation, and is also very slow. It is therefore neglected in many applications of ceramic materials.\n\nTo overcome the brittle behaviour, ceramic material development has introduced the class of [[ceramic matrix composite]] materials, in which ceramic fibers are embedded and with specific coatings are forming fiber bridges across any crack. This mechanism substantially increases the fracture toughness of such ceramics. The ceramic disc brakes are, for example using a ceramic matrix composite material manufactured with a specific process.\n\n===Electrical properties===\n\n====Semiconductors====\nSome ceramics are [[semiconductor]]s. Most of these are [[transition metal oxides]] that are II-VI semiconductors, such as [[zinc oxide]].\n\nWhile there are prospects of mass-producing blue [[LED]]s from zinc oxide, ceramicists are most interested in the electrical properties that show [[grain boundary]] effects.\n\nOne of the most widely used of these is the varistor. These are devices that exhibit the property that resistance drops sharply at a certain [[threshold voltage]]. Once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold, there is a [[Electrical breakdown|breakdown]] of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries, which results in its [[electrical resistance]] dropping from several megohms down to a few hundred [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]]s. The major advantage of these is that they can dissipate a lot of energy, and they self-reset \u2013 after the voltage across the device drops below the threshold, its resistance returns to being high.\n\nThis makes them ideal for [[Surge protector|surge-protection]] applications; as there is control over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance, they find use in all sorts of applications. The best demonstration of their ability can be found in [[electrical substation]]s, where they are employed to protect the infrastructure from [[lightning]] strikes. They have rapid response, are low maintenance, and do not appreciably degrade from use, making them virtually ideal devices for this application.\n\nSemiconducting ceramics are also employed as [[gas sensor]]s. When various gases are passed over a polycrystalline ceramic, its electrical resistance changes. With tuning to the possible gas mixtures, very inexpensive devices can be produced.\n\n====Superconductivity====\n[[File:Magnet 4.jpg|thumb|The [[Meissner effect]] demonstrated by levitating a magnet above a cuprate superconductor, which is cooled by [[liquid nitrogen]]]]\nUnder some conditions, such as extremely low temperature, some ceramics exhibit [[high-temperature superconductivity]]. The exact reason for this is not known, but there are two major families of superconducting ceramics.\n\n====Ferroelectricity and supersets====\n[[Piezoelectricity]], a link between electrical and mechanical response, is exhibited by a large number of ceramic materials, including the quartz used to [[crystal oscillator|measure time]] in watches and other electronics. Such devices use both properties of piezoelectrics, using electricity to produce a mechanical motion (powering the device) and then using this mechanical motion to produce electricity (generating a signal). The unit of time measured is the natural interval required for electricity to be converted into mechanical energy and back again.\n\nThe piezoelectric effect is generally stronger in materials that also exhibit [[pyroelectricity]], and all pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric. These materials can be used to inter convert between thermal, mechanical, or electrical energy; for instance, after synthesis in a furnace, a pyroelectric crystal allowed to cool under no applied stress generally builds up a static charge of thousands of volts. Such materials are used in [[motion sensor]]s, where the tiny rise in temperature from a warm body entering the room is enough to produce a measurable voltage in the crystal.\n\nIn turn, pyroelectricity is seen most strongly in materials which also display the [[ferroelectric effect]], in which a stable electric dipole can be oriented or reversed by applying an electrostatic field.  Pyroelectricity is also a necessary consequence of ferroelectricity. This can be used to store information in [[ferroelectric capacitor]]s, elements of [[ferroelectric RAM]].\n\nThe most common such materials are [[lead zirconate titanate]] and [[barium titanate]]. Aside from the uses mentioned above, their strong piezoelectric response is exploited in the design of high-frequency [[loudspeaker]]s, transducers for [[sonar]], and actuators for [[atomic force microscope|atomic force]] and [[scanning tunneling microscope]]s.\n\n====Positive thermal coefficient====\n[[File:Si3N4thruster.jpg|thumb|left|Silicon nitride rocket thruster. Left: Mounted in test stand. Right: Being tested with H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> propellants]]\nIncreases in temperature can cause grain boundaries to suddenly become insulating in some semiconducting ceramic materials, mostly mixtures of [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] [[titanate]]s. The critical transition temperature can be adjusted over a wide range by variations in chemistry. In such materials, current will pass through the material until [[joule heating]] brings it to the transition temperature, at which point the circuit will be broken and current flow will cease. Such ceramics are used as self-controlled heating elements in, for example, the rear-window defrost circuits of automobiles.\n\nAt the transition temperature, the material's [[dielectric]] response becomes theoretically infinite. While a lack of temperature control would rule out any practical use of the material near its critical temperature, the dielectric effect remains exceptionally strong even at much higher temperatures. Titanates with critical temperatures far below room temperature have become synonymous with \"ceramic\" in the context of ceramic capacitors for just this reason.\n\n===Optical properties===\n[[File:cermax.jpg|thumb|150px|Cermax xenon arc lamp with synthetic sapphire output window]]\n[[Optics|Optically transparent materials]] focus on the response of a material to incoming lightwaves of a range of wavelengths. [[Optical filter|Frequency selective optical filters]] can be utilized to alter or enhance the brightness and contrast of a digital image. Guided lightwave transmission via frequency selective [[waveguides]] involves the emerging field of fiber [[optics]] and the ability of certain glassy compositions as a [[transmission medium]] for a range of frequencies simultaneously ([[multi-mode optical fiber]]) with little or no [[Adjacent-channel interference|interference]] between competing [[wavelengths]] or frequencies. This [[resonant]] [[Normal mode|mode]] of [[energy]] and [[data transmission]] via electromagnetic (light) [[wave propagation]], though low powered, is virtually lossless. Optical waveguides are used as components in [[Integrated optical circuit]]s (e.g. [[light-emitting diodes]], LEDs) or as the transmission medium in local and long haul [[optical communication]] systems. Also of value to the emerging materials scientist is the sensitivity of materials to radiation in the thermal [[infrared]] (IR) portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This heat-seeking ability is responsible for such diverse optical phenomena as [[Night-vision]] and IR [[luminescence]].\n\nThus, there is an increasing need in the [[military]] sector for high-strength, robust materials which have the capability to [[transmit]] [[light]] ([[electromagnetic waves]]) in the [[visible spectrum|visible]] (0.4 \u2013 0.7 micrometers) and mid-[[infrared]] (1 \u2013 5 micrometers) regions of the spectrum. These materials are needed for applications requiring [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] armor, including next-generation high-speed [[missile]]s and pods, as well as protection against improvised explosive devices (IED).\n\nIn the 1960s, scientists at General Electric (GE) discovered that under the right manufacturing conditions, some ceramics, especially [[aluminium oxide]] (alumina), could be made [[translucent]]. These translucent materials were transparent enough to be used for containing the electrical [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] generated in high-[[pressure]] [[sodium]] street lamps. During the past two decades, additional types of transparent ceramics have been developed for applications such as nose cones for [[heat-seeking]] [[missiles]], [[window]]s for fighter [[aircraft]], and [[scintillation counter]]s for computed [[tomography]] scanners.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Thomas Soules pioneered computer modeling of light transmission through translucent ceramic alumina. His model showed that microscopic [[porosity|pores]] in ceramic, mainly trapped at the junctions of microcrystalline [[Crystallite|grains]], caused light to [[scattering|scatter]] and prevented true transparency. The volume fraction of these microscopic pores had to be less than 1% for high-quality optical transmission.\n\nThis is basically a [[particle size (grain size)|particle size]] effect. [[Opacity (optics)|Opacity]] results from the [[incoherent scattering]] of light at surfaces and [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]]. In addition to pores, most of the interfaces in a typical metal or ceramic object are in the form of [[grain boundaries]] which separate tiny regions of crystalline order. When the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent.\n\nIn the formation of [[polycrystalline]] materials ([[metals]] and ceramics) the size of the [[crystalline]] grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline [[wiktionary:Particles|particles]] present in the raw material during formation (or pressing) of the object. Moreover, the size of the [[grain boundaries]] scales directly with particle size. Thus a reduction of the original particle size below the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]] (~ 0.5 micrometers for shortwave violet) eliminates any light [[scattering]], resulting in a [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] material.\n\nRecently{{When|date=March 2011}}, Japanese scientists have developed techniques to produce ceramic parts that rival the [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]] of traditional crystals (grown from a single seed) and exceed the [[fracture toughness]] of a single crystal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In particular, scientists at the Japanese firm Konoshima Ltd., a producer of ceramic construction materials and industrial chemicals, have been looking for markets for their transparent ceramics.\n\nLivermore researchers realized that these ceramics might greatly benefit high-powered [[lasers]] used in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) Programs Directorate. In particular, a Livermore research team began to acquire advanced transparent ceramics from Konoshima to determine if they could meet the [[optical]] requirements needed for Livermore\u2019s Solid-State Heat Capacity Laser (SSHCL).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Livermore researchers have also been testing applications of these materials for applications such as advanced drivers for laser-driven [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] power plants.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Insulator.jpg|thumb|upright|Porcelain high-voltage insulator]]\n[[File:Bodyarmor.jpg|thumb|upright|Silicon carbide is used for inner plates of [[ballistic vest]]s]]\n[[File:BNcrucible.jpg|thumb|upright|Ceramic BN crucible]]\n\nA [[composite material]] of ceramic and [[metal]] is known as [[cermet]].\n\nOther ceramic materials, generally requiring greater purity in their make-up than those above, include forms of several chemical compounds, including:\n\n*[[Barium titanate]] (often mixed with [[strontium titanate]]) displays [[ferroelectricity]], meaning that its mechanical, electrical, and thermal responses are coupled to one another and also history-dependent.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20060815173829/http://www.newi.ac.uk/buckleyc/ceramics.htm Introduction To Ceramics], American Ceramic Society</ref>\nThose that do are classified as follows:\n*[[Earthenware]], fired at lower temperatures than other types\n*[[Stoneware]], [[Vitrification#In ceramics|vitreous]] or semi-vitreous \n*[[Porcelain]], which contains a high content of [[kaolin]]\n*[[Bone china]]\n\n===Classification of ceramics===\nCeramics can also be classified into three distinct material categories: \n* [[Oxide]]s: [[alumina]], [[beryllia]], [[ceria]], [[zirconia]]\n* Nonoxides: [[carbide]], [[boride]], [[nitride]], [[silicide]]\n* [[Composite material]]s: particulate reinforced, [[Ceramic matrix composite|fiber reinforced]], combinations of [[oxide]]s and nonoxides.\n\nEach one of these classes can develop unique material properties because ceramics tend to be crystalline.\n\n==Applications==\n*Knife blades: the blade of a [[ceramic knife]] will stay sharp for much longer than that of a steel knife, although it is more brittle and can snap.\n*[[Disk brake|Carbon-ceramic brake disks]] for vehicles are resistant to [[brake fade]] at high temperatures.\n*Advanced [[Composite armour|composite ceramic and metal matrices]] have been designed for most modern [[armoured fighting vehicles]] because they offer superior penetrating resistance against [[shaped charge]]s (such as [[High explosive anti-tank|HEAT]] rounds) and [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s.\n*Ceramics such as [[alumina]] and [[boron carbide]] have been used in [[bulletproof vest|ballistic armored vests]] to repel high-velocity [[rifle]] fire. Such plates are known commonly as [[Small Arms Protective Insert|small arms protective insert]]s, or SAPIs. Similar material is used to protect the [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpits]] of some military airplanes, because of the low weight of the material.\n*Ceramics can be used in place of steel for [[ball bearing]]s. Their higher hardness means they are much less susceptible to wear and typically last for triple the lifetime of a steel part. They also deform less under load, meaning they have less contact with the bearing retainer walls and can roll faster. In very high speed applications, heat from [[friction]] during rolling can cause problems for metal bearings, which are reduced by the use of ceramics. Ceramics are also more chemically resistant and can be used in wet environments where steel bearings would rust. In some cases, their electricity-insulating properties may also be valuable in bearings. Two drawbacks to ceramic bearings are a significantly higher cost and susceptibility to damage under shock loads.\n*In the early 1980s, [[Toyota]] researched production of an [[adiabatic]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] using ceramic components in the hot gas area. The ceramics would have allowed temperatures of over 3000&nbsp;\u00b0F (1650&nbsp;\u00b0C). The expected advantages would have been lighter materials and a smaller cooling system (or no need for one at all), leading to a major weight reduction. The expected increase of [[fuel efficiency]] of the engine (caused by the higher temperature, as shown by [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot's]] theorem) could not be verified experimentally; it was found that the heat transfer on the hot ceramic cylinder walls was higher than the transfer to a cooler metal wall as the cooler gas film on the metal surface works as a [[thermal insulator]]. Thus, despite all of these desirable properties, such engines have not succeeded in production because of costs for the ceramic components and the limited advantages. (Small imperfections in the ceramic material with its low [[fracture toughness]] lead to cracks, which can lead to potentially dangerous equipment failure.) Such engines are possible in laboratory settings, but mass production is not feasible with current technology. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009|reason=Where are any other references to Toyota's work?}}\n*Work is being done in developing ceramic parts for [[gas turbine]] [[heat engine|engines]]. Currently, even blades made of [[superalloy|advanced metal alloys]] used in the engines' hot section require cooling and careful limiting of operating temperatures. Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more efficiently, giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount of fuel.\n*Recent advances have been made in ceramics which include [[bioceramic]]s, such as dental implants and synthetic bones. [[Hydroxyapatite]], the natural mineral component of bone, has been made synthetically from a number of biological and chemical sources and can be formed into ceramic materials. Orthopedic implants coated with these materials bond readily to bone and other tissues in the body without rejection or inflammatory reactions so are of great interest for gene delivery and [[tissue engineering]] scaffolds. Most hydroxyapatite ceramics are very porous and lack mechanical strength, and are used to coat metal orthopedic devices to aid in forming a bond to bone or as bone fillers. They are also used as fillers for orthopedic plastic screws to aid in reducing the inflammation and increase absorption of these plastic materials. Work is being done to make strong, fully dense nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite ceramic materials for orthopedic weight bearing devices, replacing foreign metal and plastic orthopedic materials with a synthetic, but naturally occurring, bone mineral. Ultimately, these ceramic materials may be used as bone replacements or with the incorporation of protein [[collagen]]s, synthetic bones.\n*Durable actinide-containing ceramic materials have many applications such as in nuclear fuels for burning excess Pu and in chemically-inert sources of alpha irradiation for power supply of unmanned space vehicles or to produce electricity for microelectronic devices. Both use and disposal of radioactive actinides require their immobilisation in a durable host material. Nuclear waste long-lived radionuclides such as actinides are immobilised using chemically-durable crystalline materials based on polycrystalline ceramics and large single crystals.<ref>B.E. Burakov, M.I Ojovan, W.E. Lee. Crystalline Materials for Actinide Immobilisation, Imperial College Press, London, 198 pp. (2010).\nhttp://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p652.</ref>\n\n*High-tech ceramic is used in watchmaking for producing watch cases. The material is valued by watchmakers for its light weight, scratch resistance, durability and smooth touch. [[International Watch Company|IWC]] is one of the brands that initiated the use of ceramic in watchmaking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch Case Materials Explained: Ceramic {{!}} aBlogtoWatch|url=http://www.ablogtowatch.com/watch-case-materials-explained-ceramic/|website=aBlogtoWatch|date=18 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Ceramics in archaeology==\nCeramic artifacts have an important role in archaeology for understanding the culture, technology and behavior of peoples of the past. They are among the most common artifacts to be found at an archaeological site, generally in the form of small fragments of broken pottery called [[sherd]]s. Processing of collected sherds can be consistent with two main types of analysis: technical and traditional.\n\nTraditional analysis involves sorting ceramic artifacts, sherds and larger fragments into specific types based on style, composition, manufacturing and morphology. By creating these typologies it is possible to distinguish between different cultural styles, the purpose of the ceramic and technological state of the people among other conclusions. In addition, by looking at stylistic changes of ceramics over time is it possible to separate (seriate) the ceramics into distinct diagnostic groups (assemblages). A comparison of ceramic artifacts with known dated assemblages allows for a chronological assignment of these pieces.<ref>Mississippi Valley Archaeological Center, [http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/processarch/processarch/lab_ceramic.html Ceramic Analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603053406/http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/processarch/processarch/lab_ceramic.html |date=June 3, 2012 }}, Retrieved 04-11-12</ref>\n\nThe technical approach to ceramic analysis involves a finer examination of the composition of ceramic artifacts and sherds to determine the source of the material and through this the possible manufacturing site. Key criteria are the composition of the clay and the temper used in the manufacture of the article under study: temper is a material added to the clay during the initial production stage, and it is used to aid the subsequent drying process. Types of temper include shell pieces, granite fragments and ground sherd pieces called 'grog'. Temper is usually identified by microscopic examination of the temper material. Clay identification is determined by a process of refiring the ceramic, and assigning a color to it using Munsell Soil Color notation. By estimating both the clay and temper compositions, and locating a region where both are known to occur, an assignment of the material source can be made. From the source assignment of the artifact further investigations can be made into the site of manufacture.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ceramic chemistry]]\n* [[Ceramic engineering]]\n* [[Ceramic nanoparticle]]\n* [[Ceramic matrix composite]]\n* [[Ceramic art]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|title=Oriental trade ceramics in South-East Asia, ninth to sixteenth centuries: with a catalogue of Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai wares in Australian collections|first=John|last=Guy|editor-first=John|editor-last=Guy|volume=|edition=illustrated, revised|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxrrAAAAMAAJ|isbn=|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links| wikt=no | commons=Category:Ceramics | b=no | n=no | q=Ceramic | s=no | v=no | voy=no | species=no | d=no}}\n\n* [http://donsmaps.com/dolnivenus.html Dolni Vestonice Venus]- Oldest known Ceramic statuette of a nude female figure dated to 29 000 \u2013 25 000 BP (Gravettian industry.

After it came to maturity in the second or first century BCE during the [[Han dynasty]], this device was employed in many fields of early Chinese thought, including seemingly disparate fields such as geomancy or [[Feng shui]], [[Chinese astrology|astrology]], [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[music]], [[military strategy]], and [[martial arts]]. The system is still used as a reference in some forms of [[complementary and alternative medicine]] and martial arts.\n\n==Names==\nXing ({{zh|t=[[wiktionary:\u884c|\u884c]]}}) of 'Wu Xing' means moving; a planet is called a 'moving star' ({{zh|t=[[wiktionary:\u884c\u661f|\u884c\u661f]]}}) in Chinese. Wu Xing ({{zh|t=[[wiktionary:\u4e94|\u4e94]][[wiktionary:\u884c|\u884c]]}}) originally refers to the five major planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Venus, Mars) that create five dimensions of earth life.<ref name=\"Zai 2015\"/> \"Wu Xing\" is also widely translated as \"Five Elements\" and this is used extensively by many including practitioners of Five Element acupuncture. This translation arose by false analogy with the Western system of the [[four elements]].<ref name=\"Chinese History p. 179\">[[Nathan Sivin]] (1995), \"Science and Medicine in Chinese History,\" in his ''Science in Ancient China'' (Aldershot, England: Variorum), text VI, p. 179.</ref> Whereas the classical Greek elements were concerned with substances or natural qualities, the Chinese ''x\u00edng'' are \"primarily concerned with process and change,\" hence the common translation as \"phases\" or \"agents\".<ref name=\"Sivin 1987.73\">[[Nathan Sivin]] (1987), ''Traditional Medicine in Contemporary China'' (Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, The University of Michigan) p. 73.</ref> By the same token, ''M\u00f9'' is thought of as \"Tree\" rather than \"Wood\".<ref name=\"Lecture Room, CCTV-10\">{{cite AV media\n|title      = \u5343\u53e4\u4e2d\u533b\u4e4b\u5f20\u4ef2\u666f. Wood and Metal were often replaced with air\n|publisher  = [[Lecture Room]], CCTV-10}}</ref> The word 'element' is thus used within the context of Chinese medicine with a different meaning to its usual meaning.\n\nIt should be recognized that the word ''phase'', although commonly preferred, is not perfect. ''Phase'' is a better translation for the five ''seasons'' (\u4e94\u904b W\u01d4 Y\u00f9n) mentioned below, and so ''agents'' or ''processes'' might be preferred for the primary term ''x\u00edng''. Manfred Porkert attempts to resolve this by using ''Evolutive Phase'' for \u4e94\u884c ''W\u01d4 X\u00edng'' and ''Circuit Phase'' for \u4e94\u904b ''W\u01d4 Y\u00f9n'', but these terms are unwieldy.\n\nSome of the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]] (no later than 168 BC) also present the Wu Xing as \"five virtues\" or types of activities.<ref name=\"Contemporary China p. 72\">[[Nathan Sivin]] (1987), ''Traditional Medicine in Contemporary China'', p. 72.</ref> Within Chinese medicine texts the Wu Xing are also referred to as Wu Yun (\u4e94\u904b w\u01d4 y\u00f9n) or a combination of the two characters (Wu Xing-Yun) these emphasise the correspondence of five elements to five 'seasons' (four seasons plus one). Another tradition refers to the ''W\u01d4 X\u00edng'' as ''W\u01d4 D\u00e9'' (\u4e94\u5fb7), the Five Virtues ([[:zh:\u4e94\u5fb7\u7d42\u59cb\u8aaa]]).\n\n==The Phases==\nThe five phases are around 72 days each and are usually used to describe the state in nature:\n*Wood/Spring: a period of growth, which generates abundant wood and vitality\n*Fire/Summer: a period of swelling, flowering, brimming with fire and energy\n*Earth: the in-between transitional seasonal periods, or a separate 'season' known as Late Summer or Long Summer - in the latter case associated with leveling and dampening (moderation) and fruition\n*Metal/Autumn: a period of harvesting and collecting\n*Water/Winter: a period of retreat, where stillness and storage pervades\n\n==Cycles==\nThe doctrine of five phases describes two cycles, a generating or creation (\u751f, ''sh\u0113ng'') cycle, also known as \"mother-son\", and an overcoming or destruction (\u524b/\u514b, ''k\u00e8'') cycle, also known as \"grandfather-grandson\", of interactions between the phases. Within Chinese medicine the effects of these two main relations are further elaborated:\n*Inter-promoting (''sh\u0113ng'' cycle, mother/son)\n*Inter-acting (grandmother/grandson)\n*Over-acting (''k\u00e8'' cycle, grandfather/grandson)\n*Counter-acting (reverse ''k\u00e8'')\n\n===Generating===\nThe common memory jogs, which help to remind in what order the phases are:\n\n*Wood feeds Fire\n*Fire creates Earth (ash)\n*Earth bears Metal\n*Metal collects Water\n*Water nourishes Wood\n\nOther common words for this cycle include \"begets\", \"engenders\" and \"mothers\".\n\n===Overcoming===\n*Wood parts Earth (such as roots or trees can prevent soil erosion)\n*Earth dams (or muddies or absorbs) Water\n*Water extinguishes Fire\n*Fire melts Metal\n*Metal chops Wood\n\nThis cycle might also be called \"controls\", \"restrains\" or \"fathers\".\n\n==Cosmology and ''feng shui''==\n{{Main|Feng shui}}\n[[File:FiveElementsCycleBalanceImbalance 02 plain.svg|thumb|right|Another illustration of the cycle.]]\nAccording to Wu Xing theory, the structure of the cosmos mirrors the five phases. Each phase has a complex series of associations with different aspects of nature, as can be seen in the following table. In the ancient Chinese form of [[geomancy]], known as Feng Shui, practitioners all based their art and system on the five phases (Wu Xing). All of these phases are represented within the [[Bagua|trigrams]].  Associated with these phases are colors, seasons and shapes; all of which are interacting with each other.<ref name=\"Chinese Five Elements Chart\">[http://www.northernshaolinacademy.com/new/docs/FiveElementsChart.xls Chinese Five Elements Chart] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105605/http://www.northernshaolinacademy.com/new/docs/FiveElementsChart.xls |date=2007-09-28 }} Information on the Chinese Five Elements from Northern Shaolin Academy in Microsoft Excel 2003 Format</ref>\n\nBased on a particular directional energy flow from one phase to the next, the interaction can be expansive, destructive, or exhaustive.

Zou Yan claims that the Mandate of Heaven sanctions the legitimacy of a dynasty by sending self-manifesting auspicious signs in the ritual color (yellow, blue, white, red, and black) that matches the element of the new dynasty (Earth, Wood, Metal, Fire, and Water).

The church was founded \"to commemorate the word and works of [Christ Jesus]\" and \"reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing\". Sunday services are held throughout the year and weekly testimony meetings are held on Wednesday evenings, where following brief readings from the Bible and the Christian Science textbook, those in attendance are invited to give testimonies of healing brought about through Christian Science prayer.\n\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, Christian Science churches sprang up in communities around the world, though in the last several decades of that century, there was a marked decline in membership, except in Africa, where there has been growth. Headquartered in Boston, the church does not officially report membership, and estimates as to worldwide membership range between about 400,000 to less than 100,000.<ref>[http://www.religioustolerance.org/cr_sci.htm The Church Of Christ, Scientist (Christian Science)]</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0402).jpg|thumb|The church building, Huntington Ave., Boston, 1900]]\nThe church was incorporated by Mary Baker Eddy in 1879 following a claimed personal healing in 1866, which she said resulted from reading the [[Bible]].<ref name=\"IIProthero2009\">{{cite book|author1=Edward L.

The seal of Christian Science is a [[cross and crown]] with the words, \"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons,\" and is a registered trademark of the church.\n\n==Beliefs and practices==\nThe Church has collected over 50,000 testimonies of incidents that it considers healing through Christian Science treatment alone. While most of these testimonies represent ailments neither diagnosed nor treated by medical professionals, the Church requires three other people to vouch for any testimony published in its official organ, the ''[[Christian Science Journal]]''; verifiers say that they witnessed the healing or know the testifier well.<ref>[http://www.spirituality.com/journal/testimony_guidelines.jhtml \"Guidelines for submitting testimonies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324173617/http://www.spirituality.com/journal/testimony_guidelines.jhtml |date=2006-03-24 }} ''Christian Science Journal'' web site</ref>\n\nChristian Scientists may take an intensive two-week \"Primary\" class from an authorized Christian Science teacher.<ref>''Church Manual,'' page 92, Article XXX, Section 8.</ref> Those who wish to become \"Journal-listed\" (accredited) practitioners, devoting themselves full-time to the practice of healing, must first have Primary class instruction.

The [[Prudential Tower]] and 111 Huntington Avenue are in the background.]]\n[[The First Church of Christ, Scientist]] is the legal title of the [[Mother Church]] and administrative headquarters of the Christian Science Church. The complex is located in a {{convert|14|acre|m2|sing=on}} plaza alongside Huntington Avenue in the [[Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|Back Bay]] neighborhood of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].\n\nThe church itself was built in 1894, and an annex larger in footprint than the original structure was added in 1906. It boasts one of the world's largest [[pipe organ]]s, built by the [[Aeolian-Skinner|Aeolian-Skinner Company]] of Boston. The [[Mary Baker Eddy Library|Mary Baker Eddy Library for the Betterment of Humanity]] is housed in an 11-story structure originally built for The Christian Science Publishing Society constructed between 1932 and 1934, and the present plaza was constructed in the late 1960s and early 1970s to include a 28 story administration building, a [[colonnade]], and a [[reflecting pool]] with fountain, designed by [[Araldo Cossutta]] of [[I. M. Pei]] and Partners (now Pei Cobb Freed).\n\nBranch churches of The Mother Church may take the title of ''First Church of Christ, Scientist''; Second; but the article ''The'' must not be used, presumably to concede the primacy of the Boston [[Mother Church]].\n\nAn international newspaper, the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', founded by Eddy in 1908 and winner of seven [[Pulitzer prize]]s, is published by the church through the [[Christian Science Publishing Society]].\n\nBranch Christian Science churches and Christian Science societies are subordinate to the Mother Church, but are self-governed. They have their own by-laws, bank accounts, assets and officers, but in order to be recognised must abide by the by-laws in the ''[[Manual of The Mother Church]]''. Church services are regulated by the ''Manual,'' the set of by-laws written by Eddy, that establishes the church organization and explains the duties and responsibilities of members, officers, practitioners, teachers and nurses; and establishes rules for discipline and other aspects of church business.\n\n===Board of Directors===\n[[File:Christian Science Mother Church, Boston, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|right|[[The First Church of Christ, Scientist]] is the [[Mother Church]] and {{shy|ad|min|is|tra|tive head|quar|ters}} of the [[Christian Science|Christian Science Church]].]]\nThe Christian Science Board of Directors is a five-person executive entity created by [[Mary Baker Eddy]] to conduct the business of the [[Christian Science|Christian Science Church]] under the terms defined in the by-laws of the ''[[Manual of The Mother Church|Church Manual]]''. Its functions and restrictions are defined by the ''Manual.''\n\nThe Board (occasionally CSBD or the BoD for short) also includes functions defined by a Deed of Trust written by Eddy (one of several, in fact) under which it consisted of four persons, though she later expanded the Board to five persons, thus in effect leaving one of its members out of Deed functions. This later bore on a dispute during the 1920s, known as the Great Litigation in CS circles, pivoting on whether the CSBD could remove trustees of the [[Christian Science Publishing Society]] or whether the CSPS trustees were established independently.\n\nWhile Eddy's Manual established limited executive functions under the rule of law in place of a traditional hierarchy, the controversial 1991 publication of a book by [[Bliss Knapp]] led the then Board of Directors to make the unusual affidavit during a suit over Knapp's estate that neither acts by it violating the ''Manual,'' nor acts refraining from required action, constituted violations of the ''Manual''. A traditionally-minded minority held that the Board's act in publishing Knapp's book constituted a fundamental violation of several by-laws and its legal trust, automatically mandating the offending Board members' resignations under Article I, Section 9.\n\nAnother minority believed that Eddy intended various requirements for her consent (in their view, \"estoppels\") to effect the church's dissolution on her death, since they could no longer be followed literally. Ironically, one of the stronger arguments against this position came from an individual highly respected by their theological quarter, [[Bliss Knapp]], who claimed that Eddy understood through her lawyer that these consent clauses would not hinder normal operation after her decease.\n\n===Services===\nChurches worldwide hold a one-hour service each Sunday, consisting of hymns, prayer, and currently, readings from the ''[[King James Version]]'' (KJV) of the Bible (although there is no requirement that this version of the Bible be used) and ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]]''. These readings are the weekly Lesson-Sermon, which is read aloud at all Sunday services in all Christian Science churches worldwide, and is studied by individuals at home throughout the preceding week. The Lesson, as it is informally called, is compiled by a committee at The Mother Church, and is usually made up of six sections, each of which consists of passages from the Bible (read by the Second Reader) and passages from ''Science and Health'' (read by the First Reader).\n\nEddy selected 26 subjects for the Lesson-Sermon. These Lessons run in continuous rotation in the order she established, hence each subject is studied twice a year. In years in which there are 53 Sundays, the topic \"Christ Jesus\" occurs a third time, in December. In addition, there is a special, shortened Lesson-Sermon for Thanksgiving Day. Branch churches outside the United States may schedule their Thanksgiving service when convenient for them, most choosing a day in October or November, and the Thanksgiving Day proclamation by the United States president, may be omitted.\n\nBecause there are no clergy in the church, branch church Sunday services are conducted by two Readers: the First Reader, who reads passages from Science and Health, and the Second Reader, who reads passages from the Bible. First Readers determine the beginning \"scriptural selection\", hymns to be sung on Sundays, and the benediction. The vast majority of the service is the reading of the weekly Bible lesson supplied by Boston, and the order of the service set out by the Manual. To be elected the First Reader in one's branch church is one of the highest and most important positions the lay Christian Scientist may aspire to.\n\nChurches also hold a one-hour Wednesday evening testimony meeting, with similar readings, after which, those in attendance are invited to share accounts of healing through prayer. At these services, the First Reader reads passages from the Bible and Science and Health. Departing from denominational practice for over 120 years, English language churches may now choose alternate Bible translations at these services (i.e. [[Phillips New Testament in Modern English|Phillips]]).\n\nBranch churches also sponsor annual public talks (called lectures) given by speakers selected annually by the Board of Lectureship in Boston.\n\n==Recent problems==\n\n===Broadcasting===\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, church executives undertook a controversial and ambitious foray into electronic broadcast media. The first significant effort was to create a weekly half-hour syndicated television program, The Christian Science Monitor Reports. \"Monitor Reports\" was anchored in its first season by newspaper veteran Rob Nelson. He was replaced in the second by the ''Christian Science Monitor'''s former Moscow correspondent, David Willis. The program was usually broadcast by independent stations&nbsp;\u2014 often at odd hours.\n\nIn 1988, Monitor Reports was supplanted by a nightly half-hour news show, World Monitor, which was broadcast by the [[Discovery Channel]]. The program was anchored by veteran journalist [[John Hart (journalist)|John Hart]]. The Church then purchased a Boston [[cable TV]] station for elaborate in-house programming production. In parallel, the church purchased a [[shortwave radio]] station and syndicated radio production to [[National Public Radio]]. However, revenues fell far short of optimistic predictions by church managers, who had ignored early warnings by members and media experts.\n\nIn October 1991, after a series of conflicts over the boundaries between Christian Science teachings and his journalistic independence, John Hart resigned.<ref>[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-09-02/features/1992246098_1_world-monitor-non-church-christian-science-church \"Ex-anchor cites interference at Monitor\"] ''The Baltimore Sun'' September 2, 1992. Accessed Feb. 27, 2010</ref> The Monitor Channel went off the air in June 1992. Most of the other operations closed in well under a decade. Public accounts in both the mainstream and trade media reported that the church lost approximately $250 million on these ventures.\n\nThe hundreds of millions lost on broadcasting brought the church to the brink of bankruptcy. However, with the 1991 publication of ''[[The Destiny of The Mother Church]]'' by the late [[Bliss Knapp]], the church secured a $90 million bequest from the Knapp trust. The trust dictated that the book be published as \"Authorized Literature,\" with neither modification nor comment. Historically, the church had censured Knapp for deviating at several points from Eddy's teaching, and had refused to publish the work. The church's archivist, fired in anticipation of the book's publication, wrote to branch churches to inform them of the book's history. Many Christian Scientists thought the book violated the church's [[Manual of The Mother Church|by-laws]], and the editors of the church's religious periodicals and several other church employees resigned in protest. Alternate beneficiaries subsequently sued to contest the church's claim it had complied fully with the will's terms, and the church ultimately received only half of the original sum.<ref>Peter Steinfels.

December 16, 1993</ref>\n\nThe fallout of the broadcasting debacle also sparked a minor revolt among some prominent church members. In late 1993, a group of Christian Scientists filed suit against the Board of Directors, alleging a willful disregard for the [[Manual of The Mother Church|Manual of the Mother Church]] in its financial dealings. The suit was thrown out by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in 1997, but a lingering discontent with the church's financial matters persists to this day.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.appellate.net/briefs/weaverbrief.pdf | title = Appellate Brief No. SJC-07156 | accessdate = 2011-08-20 | format = pdf | publisher = COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT}}</ref>\n\n===Membership decline and financial setbacks===\nIn spite of its early meteoric rise, church membership has declined over the past eight decades, according to the church's former treasurer, J. Edward Odegaard.<ref>''The Christian Science Journal'' November 2010</ref> Though the Church is prohibited by the [[Manual of The Mother Church|Manual]] from publishing membership figures, the number of branch churches in the United States has fallen steadily since World War II. In 2009, for the first time in church history, more new members came from Africa than the United States.<ref>Christa Case Bryant, [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2009/0609/p02s07-usgn.html \"Africa contributes biggest share of new members to Christian Science church\"] ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' (June 9, 2009). Retrieved March 16, 2012</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the ''Boston Globe'' reported that the church was considering consolidating Boston operations into fewer buildings and leasing out space in buildings it owned. Church official Philip G. Davis noted that the administration and Colonnade buildings had not been fully used for many years and that vacancy increased after staff reductions in 2004. The church posted an $8 million financial loss in fiscal 2003, and in 2004 cut 125 jobs, a quarter of the staff, at the ''[[The Christian Science Monitor|Christian Science Monitor]]''. Conversely, Davis noted that \"the financial situation right now is excellent\" and stated that the church was not facing financial problems.<ref>''Boston Globe'' October 13, 2005 p.

[[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers overland from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in North America.

Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in the state), and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5p1plFeFC?url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=April 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKkzcI4A?url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]].

Income from employment was untaxed, but income from investments was taxed at 13%, the highest rate in the U.S., with no deductions allowed for costs of producing the investment income, such as interest on borrowing.\n\nIn 1991, under Governor [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.]], an Independent, the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4%. The new tax policy drew investment firms to Connecticut; as of 2014, [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] was home to the headquarters for 14 of the 200 largest [[hedge fund]]s in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hfalert.com/documents/FG/hsp/hfa-rankings/459569_Top200Managers.pdf |title=Top 200 Hedge Fund Managers |website=Hedge Fund Alert |subscription=yes}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2014, the income tax rates on Connecticut individuals are divided into six tax brackets of 3% (on income up to $10,000); 5% ($10,000-$50,000); 5.5% ($50,000-$100,000); 6% ($100,000-$200,000); 6.5% ($200,000-$250,000); and 6.7% (more than $250,000), with additional amounts owed depending on the bracket.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tax-brackets.org/connecticuttaxtable |title=Connecticut Income Tax Brackets |website=Tax-Brackets.org |date=2015 |access-date=October 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAll wages of Connecticut residents are subject to the state's income tax, even if earned outside the state. However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction. Since New York and Massachusetts have higher tax rates than Connecticut, this effectively means that Connecticut residents that work in those states have no Connecticut income tax withheld. Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions, but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation, they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount.\n\nConnecticut levies a 6.35% state [[sales tax]] on the retail sale, lease, or rental of most goods.<ref name=\"2011Sect6Summary\">{{cite web |title=Summary of Tax Provisions Contained in 2011 Conn.

The other major highways in Connecticut are the [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which together form [[Connecticut Route 15]] (Route&nbsp;15), traveling from the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York City|New York]] parallel to I-95 before turning north of [[New Haven]] and traveling parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]]. I-95 and Route&nbsp;15 were originally [[toll road]]s; they relied on a system of [[toll plaza]]s at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls.

Although I-95 has been widened in several spots, some areas are only 3 lanes and this strains traffic capacity, resulting in frequent and lengthy [[rush hour]] delays.

Larger civil airports include [[Danbury Municipal Airport]] and [[Waterbury-Oxford Airport]] in western Connecticut, [[Hartford\u2013Brainard Airport]] in central Connecticut, and [[Groton-New London Airport]] in eastern Connecticut. [[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]] is located in Stratford and mostly services cargo, helicopter and private aviation.\n\n===Ferry===\nThe [[Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry]] travels between [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] and [[Port Jefferson, New York]] by crossing [[Long Island Sound]].

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2011}}, [[Dannel Malloy]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Nancy Wyman]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

Malloy, the former mayor of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], won the [[Connecticut gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 general election]] for Governor, and was sworn in on January 5, 2011. From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs. In addition to these departments, there are other independent bureaus, offices and commissions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Department-and-Agencies/ |title=Departments and Agencies |website=Portal.CT.gov |publisher=State of Connecticut |access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller, and Attorney General. All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[President pro tempore]] presides. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] presides over the House.<ref name=\"CT_CONST\">{{cite web |title=Constitution of the State of Connecticut |website=Secretary of the State |publisher=State of Connecticut |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?A=3188&Q=392288 |date=April 21, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109004649/http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392288 |archive-date=November 9, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> {{As of|2014}}, [[Brendan Sharkey]] is the Speaker of the House of Connecticut.\n\n{{As of|2015}}, Connecticut's [[United States Senators]] are [[Richard Blumenthal]] (Democrat) and [[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]] (Democrat).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.senate.gov/states/CT/intro.htm | title=Connecticut | publisher=U.S. Senate | website=States in the Senate | access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref> Connecticut has five [[U.S. Congressional Delegations from Connecticut|representatives in the U.S. House]], all of whom are Democrats.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.house.gov/representatives/#state_ct | title=Connecticut | publisher=U.S. House of Representatives | website=Directory of Representatives | access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nLocally elected representatives also develop [[Local ordinance]]s to govern cities and towns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/ordinances.htm |title=Connecticut Ordinances and Charters by Town |website=Judicial Branch Law Libraries |publisher=State of Connecticut |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref> The town ordinances often include [[noise pollution#Human|noise control]] and [[zoning]] guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newtown-ct.gov/Public_Documents/NewtownCT_Police/Ord%20Folder/Ordinances/262 |title=Newtown Noise Control Ordinance |website=Town of Newtown |date=August 20, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511122630/http://www.newtown-ct.gov/Public_Documents/NewtownCT_Police/Ord%20Folder/Ordinances/262 |archivedate=May 11, 2013  }}</ref> However, the State of Connecticut does also provide statewide ordinances for noise control as well.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sec. 22a-69-1 to 22a-69-7.4: Control of Noise |website=Department of Environmental Protection |publisher=State of Connecticut |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/lib/sots/regulations/title_22a/069.pdf |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231223637/http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/lib/sots/regulations/title_22a/069.pdf |archive-date=December 31, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Judicial===\nThe highest [[court]] of Connecticut's judicial branch is the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]], headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut.

The 1922 election saw the main opposition party to the Australian Labor Party, the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] deprived of a majority, and were required to form a coalition in order to command a majority on the floor of parliament. The price for such support was the resignation of Nationalist (ex-Labor) Prime Minister, [[Billy Hughes]], who was replaced by [[Stanley Bruce]].\n\nIn 1922, the federal [[Division of Northern Territory]] was created, with one non-voting Member in the House of Representatives.<ref name=DocumentingDemocracy>Documenting Democracy: [http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-63.html Northern Territory Representation Act 1922 (Cth)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331140907/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-63.html |date=31 March 2015 }}</ref> [[Harold George Nelson]] was the inaugural member serving between 16 December 1922 and 15 September 1934. He was elected as an Independent but later joined the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP). Between 15 September 1934 and 10 December 1949 the [[Division of Northern Territory]] was held by [[Adair Blain]], an independent member. Between 10 December 1949 and 31 October 1966 the Division was held by [[Jock Nelson]], a member of the ALP. The Territory seat was won by the Country Party's [[Sam Calder]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1966|1966 federal election]], who held the seat from 26 November 1966 to 19 September 1980.\n\nIn 1966, the Country Party was established in the Northern Territory, while the Liberal Party was a small party. In recognition of this, the local Liberals supported the Country Party's Calder for the sole NT seat from 1969 to 1972. An alliance had formed, primarily against the conservatives' main opponent, the ALP.  After the gradual extension of limited voting rights, in 1968 the federal Coalition government gave the Member for Northern Territory full voting rights.<ref name=DocumentingDemocracy />\n\n===Foundation and electoral record===\nAfter the [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 federal election]] and the subsequent [[Joint Sitting, Australian parliament, 1974|Joint Sitting of parliament]], legislation was passed to give the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the Northern Territory representation in the [[Australian Senate]], with two senators being elected.\n\nThe [[Whitlam Government]] passed legislation in 1974 to establish a fully elected [[unicameral]] [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] to replace the previous partly elected [[Northern Territory Legislative Council]], which had been in existence since 1947. The term of the Legislative Assembly was four years. Initially, the Legislative Assembly consisted of 19 members, which was increased in 1982 to 25 members, the present number. The Northern Territory was granted self-government in 1978.\n\nFollowing the creation of the Legislative Assembly in 1974, the Territory's branches of the Country and Liberal parties merged to form the \"Country Liberal Party\" (CLP) to field candidates at the [[Northern Territory general election, 1974|1974 general election]] for the Legislative Assembly,<ref name=\"parliament.curriculum.edu.au\"/> going on to win 17 out of 19 seats.<ref name=\"Lansford2014\"/> Calder was largely responsible for the push to unite the non-Labor forces in the Territory.\n\nThe CLP fielded candidates at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975 federal election]], winning one seat each in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. Since 1979, the CLP has been formally affiliated with both the federal National (previously the Country Party and National Country Party) and Liberal parties.<ref name=\"Lansford2014\"/> The CLP contests seats for the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] in the Northern Territory rather than the Liberal or National parties.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The CLP has full voting rights within the National Party, and observer status with the Liberal Party.\n\nThe CLP governed the Northern Territory from 1974 until the [[Northern Territory general election, 2001|2001 election]]. During this time, it never faced more than nine opposition members. Indeed, the CLP's dominance was so absolute that its internal politics were seen as a bigger threat than any opposition party.<ref>[[Antony Green|Green, Antony]].

This result was only outdone by the 1974 election, in which the CLP faced only two independents as opposition.  The CLP even lost two seats in [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]], an area where the ALP had never come close to winning any seats before.\n\nIn the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 federal election]], the CLP won the newly formed seat of [[Division of Solomon|Solomon]], based on Darwin/Palmerston, in the House of Representatives.<ref name=\"Carlisle2005\">{{cite book|editor=Rodney P.

She sat with the Liberals in the House.\n\nThe [[Northern Territory general election, 2008|2008 election]] saw the CLP recover from the severe loss it suffered three years earlier, increasing its representation from four to 11 members. Following the 2011 decision of ALP-turned-independent member [[Alison Anderson]] to join the CLP, this increased to CLP's representation to 12 in the Assembly, leaving the incumbent Henderson Government to govern in minority with the support of Independent MP [[Gerry Wood]].\n\nHistorically, the CLP has been particularly dominant in the Territory's two major cities, [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]/Palmerston and [[Alice Springs]]. However, in recent years the ALP has pulled even with the CLP in the Darwin area; indeed, its 2001 victory was fueled by an unexpected swing in Darwin.\n\n===2012 return to office===\n{{main|Northern Territory general election, 2012}}\nThe CLP under the leadership of [[Terry Mills (Australian politician)|Terry Mills]] returned to power in the [[Northern Territory general election, 2012|2012 election]] with 16 of 25 seats,<ref>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Antony|title=Final Figures for 2012 Northern Territory Election|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2012/09/northern-territory-election-updates.html|publisher=ABC|accessdate=2 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110823032733/http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2012/09/northern-territory-election-updates.html|archivedate=23 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> defeating the incumbent Labor Government led by [[Paul Henderson (politician)|Paul Henderson]].

Powerful and wealthy individuals often simply did not abide by the rules and were allowed to approach family life and marriage how they saw fit. A prime instance of this was shown through annulments granted by the church. The church strongly disregarded and disallowed divorce. However, powerful men could often annul their marriages. This was noteworthy due to the fact that an annulment was very distorting to marriage law and contradicting to the disallowance of divorce. An annulment would not only cease a marriage but rather end the marriage and rule that the marriage was never valid, nor did it ever formally exist. Another potent example of Canon Law not being enforced is in regards to polygyny. Men having multiple wives was outright banned by the Catholic church. However, as seen previously in the example of wealthy and powerful individuals it was allowed.

One example where it did not previously apply was in the English legal system, as well as systems, such as the U.S., that [[Common_law|derived from it]]. Here criminals could apply for the [[Benefit of clergy]]. Being in holy orders, or fraudulently claiming to be, meant that criminals could opt to be tried by [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastical]] rather than secular courts. The ecclesiastical courts were generally more lenient. Under the [[House of Tudor|Tudors]], the scope of clerical benefit was steadily reduced by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. The Vatican disputed secular authority over priests' criminal offences, and this in turn contributed to the [[English Reformation]]. The benefit of clergy was systematically removed from English legal systems over the next 200 years, although it still occurred in South Carolina in [[Henry Shultz|1827]].\n\nThe structure that the fully developed Roman Law provides is a contribution to the Canon Law.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rodes|first1=Robert E.|title=The Canon Law as a Legal System-Function, Obligation, and Sanction|date=1964|page=47|url=https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://search.yahoo.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1081&context=nd_naturallaw_forum|accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref> The academic degrees in canon law are the J.C.B. (''Juris Canonici Baccalaureatus'', Bachelor of Canon Law, normally taken as a graduate degree), J.C.L. (''Juris Canonici Licentiatus'', [[Licentiate of Canon Law]]) and the J.C.D. (''Juris Canonici Doctor'', [[Doctor of Canon Law]]). Because of its specialized nature, advanced degrees in civil law or theology are normal prerequisites for the study of canon law.\n\nMuch of the legislative style was adapted from the Roman Law [[Codex iuris civilis|Code of Justinian]]. As a result, Roman ecclesiastical courts tend to follow the [[Roman Law]] style of continental Europe with some variation, featuring collegiate panels of judges and an investigative form of proceeding, called \"[[Inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]]\", from the Latin \"inquirere\", to enquire. This is in contrast to the [[Adversarial system|adversarial]] form of proceeding found in the common law system of English and U.S. law, which features such things as juries and single judges.\n\nThe institutions and practices of canon law paralleled the legal development of much of Europe, and consequently both modern [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[common law (legal system)]] bear the influences of canon law. Edson Luiz Sampel, a Brazilian expert in canon law, says that canon law is contained in the genesis of various institutes of civil law, such as the law in continental Europe and Latin American countries. Sampel explains that canon law has significant influence in contemporary society.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/92870/canon-law \"canon law.\"] Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Each had its own special law, in which custom still played an important part. One major difference in Eastern Europe however, specifically in the Orthodox Christian churches was in regards to divorce. Divorce started to slowly be allowed in specific instances such as adultery being committed, abuse, abandonment, impotence and barrenness being the primary justifications for divorce. Eventually, the church began to allow remarriage to occur (for both spouses) post-divorce.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1929 Pius XI informed the Eastern Churches of his intention to work out a Code for the whole of the Eastern Church.

Their separate status dates back to the 12th century when the [[Normans]] split them off from the mixed secular/religious county and local courts used by the Saxons. In contrast to the other courts of England the law used in ecclesiastical matters is at least partially a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, not [[common law]], although heavily governed by parliamentary statutes. Since the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], ecclesiastical courts in England have been royal courts. The teaching of canon law at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge was abrogated by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]; thereafter practitioners in the [[ecclesiastical courts]] were trained in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], receiving a [[Doctor of Civil Law]] (D.C.L.) degree from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], or a Doctor of Laws ([[Doctor of Laws|LL.D.]]) degree from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Such lawyers (called \"doctors\" and \"civilians\") were centered at \"[[Doctors' Commons|Doctors Commons]]\", a few streets south of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London, where they monopolized [[probate]], matrimonial, and [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases until their jurisdiction was removed to the [[common law]] courts in the mid-19th century.\n\nOther churches in the [[Anglican Communion]] around the world (e.g., the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]], and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]]) still function under their own private systems of canon law.\n\nCurrently, (2004), there are principles of canon law common to the churches within the Anglican Communion; their existence can be factually established; each province or church contributes through its own legal system to the principles of canon law common within the Communion; these principles have a strong persuasive authority and are fundamental to the self-understanding of each of the churches of the Communion; these principles have a living force, and contain in themselves the possibility of further development; and the existence of these principles both demonstrates unity and promotes unity within the Anglican Communion.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/windsor2004/section_c/p9.cfm |title=The Windsor Report - Section C - Canon Law and Covenant |publisher=Anglican Communion Office |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref>\n\n==Presbyterian and Reformed churches==\n{{See also|Presbyterian polity}}\nIn Presbyterian and Reformed churches, canon law is known as \"practice and procedure\" or  \"church order\", and includes the church's laws respecting its government, discipline, legal practice and worship.\n\nRoman canon law had been criticized by the Presbyterians as early as 1572 in the [[Admonition to Parliament]]. The protest centered on the standard defense that canon law could be retained so long as it did not contradict the civil law. According to Polly Ha, the Reformed Church Government refuted this claiming that the bishops had been enforcing canon law for 1500 years.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWDMb0sW-hoC&pg=PA34 |title=English Presbyterianism, 1590-1640 |isbn=9780804759878 |accessdate=2013-08-09 |last=Ha |first=Polly |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2010}}</ref>\n\n==Lutheranism==\nThe [[Book of Concord]] is the historic [[doctrinal statement]] of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]], consisting of ten [[creed|credal]] documents recognized as authoritative in [[Lutheranism]] since the 16th century.<ref>Bente, Friedrich., ed. and trans., ''Concordia Triglotta'', (St. Louis: [[Concordia Publishing House]], 1921), p. i</ref>  However, the Book of Concord is a confessional document (stating orthodox belief) rather than a book of ecclesiastical rules or discipline, like canon law.

Despite its remote location in the [[Vosges Mountains]], the community became a popular pilgrimage site that attracted so many monastic vocations that two new monasteries had to be formed to accommodate them.<ref name=\"cna\">{{cite web|title=St. Columbanus |work=Catholic News Agency |date= |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=716 |accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref> In 590, Columbanus obtained from King Gontram the Gallo-Roman castle called ''Luxovium'' in present-day [[Luxeuil-les-Bains]], some eight miles from Annegray.<ref name=jonas-17>Jonas 643, p. 17.</ref> The castle, soon transformed into a monastery, was located in a wild region, thickly covered with pine forests and brushwood. Columbanus erected a third monastery called ''Ad-fontanas'' at present-day [[Fontaine-l\u00e8s-Luxeuil]], named for its numerous springs.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/><ref name=jonas-17/> These monastic communities remained under Columbanus' authority, and their rules of life reflected the Irish tradition in which he had been formed. As these communities expanded and drew more pilgrims, Columbanus sought greater solitude, spending periods of time in a hermitage and communicating with the monks through an intermediary. Often he would withdraw to a cave seven miles away, with a single companion who acted as messenger between himself and his companions.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/><ref name=\"cna\"/><ref name=jonas-17/>\n\nDuring his twenty years in [[Gaul]] (in present-day France), Columbanus became involved in a dispute with the Frankish bishops who may have feared his growing influence. During the first half of the sixth century, the councils of Gaul had given to bishops absolute authority over religious communities. As heirs to the Irish monastic tradition, Columbanus and his monks used the Irish Easter calculation, a version of [[Bishop Augustalis]]'s 84-year ''[[computus]]'' for determining the date of Easter ([[Quartodecimanism]]), whereas the [[Franks]] had adopted the [[Victorius of Aquitaine|Victorian]] cycle of 532 years. The bishops objected to the newcomers' continued observance of their own dating, which\u2014among other issues\u2014caused the end of [[Lent]] to differ. They also complained about the distinct [[Celtic Christianity#Monastic tonsure|Irish tonsure]]. In 602, the bishops assembled to judge Columbanus, but he did not appear before them as requested. Instead, he sent a letter to the prelates\u2014a strange mixture of freedom, reverence, and charity\u2014admonishing them to hold synods more frequently, and advising them to pay more attention to matters of equal importance to that of the date of Easter. In defence of his following his traditional paschal cycle, he wrote:\n{{quote|I am not the author of this divergence. I came as a poor stranger into these parts for the cause of Christ, Our Saviour. One thing alone I ask of you, holy Fathers, permit me to live in silence in these forests, near the bones of seventeen of my brethren now dead.<ref name=\"smith\"/>}}\nWhen the bishops refused to abandon the matter, Columbanus, following Saint Patrick's canon, appealed directly to [[Pope Gregory I]]. In the third and only surviving letter, he asks \"the holy Pope, his Father\" to provide \"the strong support of his authority\" and to render a \"verdict of his favour\", apologising for \"presuming to argue as it were, with him who sits in the chair of Peter, Apostle and Bearer of the Keys\". None of the letters were answered, most likely due to the pope's death in 604.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Columbanus then sent a letter to Gregory's successor, [[Pope Boniface IV]], asking him to confirm the tradition of his elders\u2014if it is not contrary to the Faith\u2014so that he and his monks can follow the rites of their ancestors. Before Boniface responded, Columbanus moved outside the jurisdiction of the Frankish bishops. Since the Easter issue appears to end around that time, Columbanus may have stopped celebrating Irish date of Easter after moving to Italy.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>{{refn|The Italians themselves followed a third system of reckoning Easter, based on the improvements to Victorius's system introduced by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] at the time he devised the [[Anno Domini]] dating system.<ref>Blackburn 1999, p. 767.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nColumbanus was also involved in a dispute with members of the Frankish royal family. Upon the death of King Gontram of Burgundy, the succession passed to his nephew, [[Childebert II]], the son of his brother [[Sigebert I|Sigebert]] and Sigebert's wife [[Brunhilda of Austrasia]]. When Childebert II died, he left two sons, [[Theuderic II]] who inherited the Kingdom of [[Burgundy]], and [[Theudebert II]] who inherited the Kingdom of [[Austrasia]]. Since both were minors, Brunhilda, their grandmother, declared herself their guardian and controlled the governments of the two kingdoms.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\nTheuderic II venerated Columbanus and often visited him, but the saint admonished and rebuked him for his behaviour.  When Theuderic began living with a mistress, the saint objected, earning the displeasure of Brunhilda, who thought a royal marriage would threaten her own power.<ref name=\"cna\"/> The saint did not spare the demoralised court, and Brunhilda became his bitterest foe.<ref name=\"cusack\">Cusack 2002, p. 173.</ref> Angered by the saint's moral stand, Brunhilda stirred up the bishops and nobles to find fault with his monastic rules. When Theuderic II finally confronted Columbanus at Luxeuil, ordering him to conform to the country's conventions, the saint refused and was then taken prisoner to [[Free Imperial City of Besan\u00e7on|Besan\u00e7on]]. Columbanus managed to escape his captors and returned to his monastery at Luxeuil. When the king and his grandmother found out, they sent soldiers to drive him back to Ireland by force, separating him from his monks by insisting that only those from Ireland could accompany him into exile.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\nColumbanus was taken to [[Nevers]], then travelled by boat down the [[Loire]] river to the coast. At [[Tours]] he visited the tomb of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]], and sent a message to Theuderic II indicating that within three years he and his children would perish. When he arrived at [[Nantes]], he wrote a letter before embarkation to his fellow monks at Luxeuil monastery. Filled with love and affection, the letter urges his brethren to obey [[Saint Attala|Attala]], who stayed behind as abbot of the monastic community.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> The letter concludes:\n{{quote|They come to tell me the ship is ready. The end of my parchment compels me to finish my letter. Love is not orderly; it is this which has made it confused. Farewell, dear hearts of mine; pray for me that I may live in God.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>}}\nSoon after the ship set sail from Nantes, a severe storm drove the vessel back ashore. Convinced that his holy passenger caused the tempest, the captain refused further attempts to transport the monk. Columbanus made his way across Gaul to visit King [[Chlothar II]] of Neustria at [[Soissons]] where he was gladly received. Despite the king's offers to stay in his kingdom, Columbanus left Neustria in 611 for the court of King [[Theudebert II]] of [[Austrasia]] in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian Franks]].<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\n===The Alps===\nColumbanus travelled to [[Metz]], where he received an honourable welcome, and then proceeding to [[Mainz]], where he sailed upwards the [[Rhine]] river to the lands of the [[Suebi]] and [[Alemanni]] in the northern Alps, intending to preach the Gospel to these people. He followed the Rhine river and its tributaries, the [[Aar]] and the [[Limmat]], and then on to [[Lake Zurich]]. Columbanus chose the village of [[Tuggen]] as his initial community, but the work was not successful.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> He continued north-east by way of Arbon to [[Bregenz]] on [[Lake Constance]]. Here the saint found an [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] dedicated to Saint Aurelia containing three brass images of their tutelary deities. Columbanus commanded [[Saint Gall|Gallus]], who knew the local language, to preach to the inhabitants, and many were converted. The three brass images were destroyed, and Columbanus blessed the little church, placing the relics of Saint Aurelia beneath the altar. A monastery was erected, [[Wettingen-Mehrerau Abbey|Mehrerau Abbey]], and the brethren observed their regular life. Columbanus stayed in Bregenz for about one year.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Following an uprising against the community, possibly related to that region being taken over by the saint's old enemy King Theuderic II, Columbanus resolved to cross the Alps into Italy.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Gallus remained in this area and died there 646. About seventy years later  at the place of Gallus' cell the [[Abbey of St Gall|Monastery of Saint Gall]] was founded, which in itself was the origin of the city of [[St. Gallen]] again about another three hundred years later.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Location map+ | Alps\n| relief = Y\n| default_width = 300\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Alps\n    | label = Tuggen\n    | lat_deg = 47.2011\n    | lon_deg = 8.94103 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Alps\n    | label = Bregenz\n    | lat_deg = 47.50343\n    | lon_deg = 9.74732 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Alps\n    | label = Milan\n    | lat_deg = 45.46427    \n    | lon_deg = 9.18951 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Alps\n    | label = Bobbio\n    | lat_deg = 44.7716    \n    | lon_deg = 9.38641 }}\n| caption = Columbanus in the Alps and Italy\n}}\nColumbanus arrived in [[Milan]] in 612 and was warmly greeted by King [[Agilulf]] and Queen [[Theodelinda]] of the [[Lombards]].{{refn|Some scholars believe that Columbanus made two journeys into Italy, which were confounded by Jonas. On his first journey, Columbanus went to Rome and received from Pope Gregory I sacred relics.<ref name=\"stokes\">Stokes 2007, p. 132</ref> This may possibly explain the traditional spot in St. Peter's, where Pope Gregory I and Columbanus are supposed to have met.<ref name=\"moran\">Moran 2010, p. 105</ref>|group=Note}} He immediately began refuting the teachings of [[Arianism]], which had enjoyed a degree of acceptance in Italy. He wrote a treatise against Arianism, which has since been lost. Queen Theodelinda, the devout daughter of Duke [[Garibald I of Bavaria]], played an important role in restoring [[Nicene Christianity]] to a position of primacy against Arianism, and was largely responsible for the king's conversion to Christianity.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\nAt the king's request, Columbanus wrote a letter to [[Pope Boniface IV]] on the controversy over the ''[[Three-Chapter Controversy|Three Chapters]]''\u2014writings by Syrian bishops suspected of [[Nestorianism]], which had been condemned in the fifth century as [[heresy]]. [[Pope Gregory I]] had tolerated in Lombardy those persons who defended the ''Three Letters'', among them King Agilulf. Columbanus agreed to take up the issue on behalf of the king. The letter begins with an apology that a \"foolish Scot (''Scottus'', Irishman)\" would be writing for a Lombard king. After acquainting the pope with the imputations brought against him, he entreats the pontiff to prove his orthodoxy and assemble a council. He writes that his freedom of speech is consistent with the custom of his country.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Some of the language used in the letter might now be regarded as disrespectful, but in that time, faith and austerity could be more indulgent.<ref name=\"montalembert-440\">Montalembert 1861, p. 440.</ref> At the same time, the letter expresses the most affectionate and impassioned devotion to the Holy See.\n{{quote|We Irish, though dwelling at the far ends of the earth, are all disciples of Saint Peter and Saint Paul ... we are bound to the Chair of Peter, and although Rome is great and renowned, through that Chair alone is she looked on as great and illustrious among us ... On account of the two Apostles of Christ, you are almost celestial, and Rome is the head of the whole world, and of the Churches.}}\nIf Columbanus' zeal for orthodoxy caused him to overstep the limits of discretion, his real attitude towards Rome is sufficiently clear, calling the pope \"his Lord and Father in Christ\", the \"Chosen Watchman\", and the \"First Pastor, set higher than all mortals\".<ref name=\"allnatt\">Allnatt 2007, p. 105.</ref>\n[[File:Bobbio-abbazia di san colombano-esterno6.jpg|thumb|left|Facade of the Abbey in Bobbio]]\nKing Agilulf gave Columbanus a tract of land called [[Bobbio]] between Milan and Genoa near the [[Trebbia]] river, situated in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] of the [[Apennine Mountains]], to be used as a base for the conversion of the Lombard people. The area contained a ruined church and wastelands known as ''Ebovium'', which had formed part of the lands of the papacy prior to the Lombard invasion. Columbanus wanted this secluded place, for while enthusiastic in the instruction of the Lombards he preferred solitude for his monks and himself. Next to the little church, which was dedicated to [[Saint Peter]], Columbanus erected a monastery in 614. [[Bobbio Abbey]] at its foundation followed the Rule of Saint Columbanus, based on the monastic practices of [[Celtic Christianity]]. For centuries it remained the stronghold of orthodoxy in northern Italy.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>{{refn|Bobbio Abbey may have been the model for the monastery in northern Italy in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]''.|group=Note}}\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:Bobbio bridge.jpg|thumb|Stone bridge over the Trebbia river leading to [[Bobbio Abbey]] in northern Italy]]\nDuring the last year of his life, Columbanus received messenges from King [[Chlothar II]], inviting the saint to return to Burgundy, now that his enemies were dead. Columbanus did not return, but requested that the king should always protect his monks at [[Luxeuil Abbey]]. He prepared for death by retiring to his cave on the mountainside overlooking the Trebbia river, where, according to a tradition, he had dedicated an oratory to Our Lady.<ref name=\"montalembert-444\">Montalembert 1861, p. 444.</ref> Columbanus died at Bobbio on 21 November 615.\n\n==Rule of Saint Columbanus==\nThe Rule of Saint Columbanus embodied the customs of [[Bangor Abbey]] and other Irish monasteries. Much shorter than the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], the Rule of Saint Columbanus consists of ten chapters, on the subjects of obedience, silence, food, poverty, humility, chastity, choir offices, discretion, mortification, and perfection.<ref name=\"ucc\">{{cite web|author=Columbanus Hibernus |editor-last=Walker |editor-first=G.S.M. |title=Monk's Rules |work=Corpus of Electronic Texts |publisher=University College Cork |date= |url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/T201052.html |accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the first chapter, Columbanus introduces the great principle of his Rule: obedience, absolute and unreserved. The words of seniors should always be obeyed, just as \"Christ obeyed the Father up to death for us.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> One manifestation of this obedience was constant hard labour designed to subdue the flesh, exercise the will in daily self-denial, and set an example of industry in cultivation of the soil. The least deviation from the Rule entailed corporal punishment, or a severe form of fasting.<ref name=\"smith\"/> In the second chapter, Columbanus instructs that the rule of silence be \"carefully observed\", since it is written: \"But the nurture of righteousness is silence and peace\". He also warns, \"Justly will they be damned who would not say just things when they could, but preferred to say with garrulous loquacity what is evil ...\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> In the third chapter, Columbanus instructs, \"Let the monks' food be poor and taken in the evening, such as to avoid repletion, and their drink such as to avoid intoxication, so that it may both maintain life and not harm ...\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> Columbanus continues:\n{{quote|For indeed those who desire eternal rewards must only consider usefulness and use. Use of life must be moderated just as toil must be moderated, since this is true discretion, that the possibility of spiritual progress may be kept with a temperance that punishes the flesh. For if temperance exceeds measure, it will be a vice and not a virtue; for virtue maintains and retains many goods. Therefore we must fast daily, just as we must feed daily; and while we must eat daily, we must gratify the body more poorly and sparingly ...\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/>}}\n\n[[Image:Columbanus at Bobbio.jpg|thumb|upright|Fresco of Saint Columbanus in [[Brugnato Cathedral]]]]\nIn the fourth chapter, Columbanus presents the virtue of poverty and of overcoming greed, and that monks should be satisfied with \"small possessions of utter need, knowing that greed is a leprosy for monks\". Columbanus also instructs that \"nakedness and disdain of riches are the first perfection of monks, but the second is the purging of vices, the third the most perfect and perpetual love of God and unceasing affection for things divine, which follows on the forgetfulness of earthly things. Since this is so, we have need of few things, according to the word of the Lord, or even of one.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> In the fifth chapter, Columbanus warns against vanity, reminding the monks of Jesus' warning in Luke 16:15: \"You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> In the sixth chapter, Columbanus instructs that \"a monk's chastity is indeed judged in his thoughts\" and warns, \"What profit is it if he be virgin in body, if he be not virgin in mind? For God, being Spirit.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/>\n\nIn the seventh chapter, Columbanus instituted a service of perpetual prayer, known as ''[[laus perennis]]'', by which choir succeeded choir, both day and night.<ref name=\"montalembert-405\">Montalembert 1898, II p. 405.</ref> In the eighth chapter, Columbanus stresses the importance of discretion in the lives of monks to avoid \"the downfall of some, who beginning without discretion and passing their time without a sobering knowledge, have been unable to complete a praiseworthy life.\" Monks are instructed to pray to God for to \"illumine this way, surrounded on every side by the world's thickest darkness\".<ref name=\"ucc\"/> Columbanus continues: \n{{quote|So discretion has got its name from discerning, for the reason that it discerns in us between good and evil, and also between the moderate and the complete. For from the beginning either class has been divided like light and darkness, that is, good and evil, after evil began through the devil's agency to exist by the corruption of good, but through God's agency Who first illumines and then divides. Thus righteous Abel chose the good, but unrighteous Cain fell upon evil.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/>}}\n\nIn the ninth chapter, Columbanus presents mortification as an essential element in the lives of monks, who are instructed, \"Do nothing without counsel.\" Monks are warned to \"beware of a proud independence, and learn true lowliness as they obey without murmuring and hesitation.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> According to the Rule, there are three components to mortification: \"not to disagree in mind, not to speak as one pleases with the tongue, not to go anywhere with complete freedom.\" This mirrors the words of Jesus, \"For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.\" (John 6:38) In the tenth and final chapter, Columbanus regulates forms of [[penance]] (often corporal) for offences, and it is here that the Rule of Saint Columbanus differs significantly from that of Saint Benedict.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\nThe habit of the monks consisted of a tunic of undyed wool, over which was worn the [[cuculla]], or cowl, of the same material. A great deal of time was devoted to various kinds of [[manual labour]], not unlike the life in monasteries of other rules. The Rule of Saint Columbanus was approved of by the [[Synod of M\u00e2con]] in 627, but it was superseded at the close of the century by the Rule of Saint Benedict. For several centuries in some of the greater monasteries the two rules were observed conjointly.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\n==Character==\nColumbanus did not lead a perfect life. According to Jonas and other sources, he could be impetuous and even headstrong, for by nature he was eager, passionate, and dauntless. These qualities were both the source of his power and the cause of his mistakes.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> His virtues, however, were quite remarkable. Like many saints, he had a great love for God's creatures. Stories claim that as he walked in the woods, it was not uncommon for birds to land on his shoulders to be caressed, or for squirrels to run down from the trees and nestle in the folds of his cowl.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Although a strong defender of Irish traditions, he never wavered in showing deep respect for the Holy See as the supreme authority. His influence in Europe was due to the conversions he effected and to the rule that he composed. It may be that the example and success of Saint [[Columba]] in Caledonia inspired him to similar exertions.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> The life of Columbanus stands as the prototype of missionary activity in Europe, followed by such men as [[Saint Kilian]], [[Vergilius of Salzburg]], [[Donatus of Fiesole]], [[Wilfrid]], [[Willibrord]], [[Suitbert of Kaiserwerdt]], [[Saint Boniface]], and [[Ursicinus of Saint-Ursanne]].<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\n==Miracles==\nThe following are the principal miracles attributed to his intercession:<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n# Procuring food for a sick monk and curing the wife of his benefactor\n# Escaping injury while surrounded by wolves\n# Causing a bear to evacuate a cave at his biddings\n# Producing a spring of water near his cave\n# Replenishing the Luxeuil granary\n# Multiplying bread and beer for his community\n# Curing sick monks, who rose from their beds at his request to reap the harvest\n# Giving sight to a blind man at Orleans\n# Destroying with his breath a cauldron of beer prepared for a pagan festival\n# Taming a bear and yoking it to a plough\n\nJonas relates the occurrence of a miracle during Columbanus' time in Bregenz, when that region was experiencing a period of severe famine.\n{{quote|Although they were without food, they were bold and unterrified in their faith, so that they obtained food from the Lord. After their bodies had been exhausted by three days of fasting, they found so great an abundance of birds, just as the quails formerly covered the camp of the children of Israel, that the whole country near there was filled with birds. The man of God knew that this food had been scattered on the ground for his own safety and that of his brethren, and that the birds had come only because he was there. He ordered his followers first to render grateful praises to the Creator, and then to take the birds as food. And it was a wonderful and stupendous miracle; for the birds were seized according to the father's commands and did not attempt to fly away. The manna of birds remained for three days. On the fourth day, a priest from an adjacent city, warned by divine inspiration, sent a supply of grain to Saint Columban. When the supply of grain arrived, the Omnipotent, who had furnished the winged food to those in want, immediately commanded the phalanxes of birds to depart. We learned this from Eustasius, who was present with the others, under the command of the servant of God. He said that no one of them remembered ever having seen birds of such a kind before; and the food was of so pleasant savor that it surpassed royal viands.

According to some authorities, twelve teeth of the saint were taken from the tomb in the fifteenth century and kept in the treasury, but these have since disappeared.<ref name=\"stokes-183\">Stokes, p. 183.</ref>\n\nColumbanus is named in the [[Roman Martyrology]] on 23 November, which is his feast day in Ireland. His feast is observed by the Benedictines on 24 November. Columbanus is the patron saint of motorcyclists. In art, Columbanus is represented bearded bearing the monastic cowl, holding in his hand a book with an Irish [[satchel (bag)|satchel]], and standing in the midst of wolves. Sometimes he is depicted in the attitude of taming a bear, or with sun-beams over his head.<ref name=\"husenheth\">Husenheth, p. 33.</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Allnatt |first=Charles F.

It is the resting place of [[Franklin Pierce]], 14th [[President of the United States]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Old Town House.GIF|thumb|left| Old Town House, 1790]]\nThe area that would become Concord was originally settled thousands of years ago by [[Abenaki]] Native Americans called the [[Pennacook]].<ref name=Lyford/>{{rp|65}} The tribe fished for [[Fish migration|migrating]] [[salmon]], [[sturgeon]], and [[alewife|alewives]] with nets strung across the rapids of the [[Merrimack River]]. The stream was also the transportation route for their [[birch bark]] canoes, which could travel from [[Lake Winnipesaukee]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The broad sweep of the Merrimack River valley [[floodplain]] provided good soil for farming [[bean]]s, [[gourd]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, [[melon]]s and [[maize]].\n\nOn January 17, 1725, the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], which then claimed territories west of the Merrimack River, granted the Concord area as the Plantation of Penacook.<ref name=Lyford/>{{rp|107}} It was settled between 1725 and 1727 by Captain Ebenezer Eastman and others from [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]]. On February 9, 1734, the town was incorporated as Rumford,<ref name=Lyford/>{{rp|147}} from which [[Benjamin Thompson|Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford]] would take his title. It was renamed Concord in 1765 by Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] following a bitter boundary dispute between Rumford and the town of [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]]; the city name was meant to reflect the new concord, or harmony, between the disputant towns.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Jacob|title=Annals of the Town of Concord|publisher=Jacob B. Moore|year=1824|location=Concord, N.H.|pages=31\u201334}}</ref> Citizens displaced by the resulting border adjustment were given land elsewhere as compensation. In 1779, New Pennacook Plantation was granted to Timothy Walker, Jr. and his associates at what would be incorporated in 1800 as [[Rumford, Maine]], the site of Pennacook Falls.\n\nConcord grew in prominence throughout the 18th century, and some of its earliest houses survive [[Concord Historic District|at the northern end of Main Street]]. In the years following the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], Concord's central geographical location made it a logical choice for the state capital, particularly after Samuel Blodget in 1807 opened a [[canal]] and [[lock (water transport)|lock]] system to allow vessels passage around the [[Amoskeag Falls]] downriver, connecting Concord with [[Boston]] by way of the [[Middlesex Canal]]. In 1808, Concord was named the official seat of state government.<ref name=Lyford/>{{rp|324\u2013326}} The 1819 [[New Hampshire State House|State House]] is the oldest capitol in the nation in which the state's legislative branches meet in their original chambers. The city would become noted for [[furniture]]-making and [[granite]] [[quarry]]ing. In 1828, Lewis Downing joined J. Stephens Abbot to form [[Abbot-Downing Company|Abbot and Downing]].<ref name=Lyford/>{{rp|339\u2013340}} Their most famous product was their [[Concord stagecoach]], widely used in the development of the [[American West]]. In the 19th century, Concord became a hub for the [[railroad]] industry, with Penacook a [[textile]] manufacturing center using [[hydropower|water power]] from the [[Contoocook River]]. Today, the city is a center for health care and several [[insurance company|insurance companies]].

For example, the chlorophycean CW [[clade]], and chlorophycean DO clade, are defined by the arrangement of their [[flagella]]. Members of the CW clade have flagella that are displaced in a \"clockwise\" (CW, 1\u20137 o'clock) direction e.g. [[Chlamydomonadales]].  Members of the DO clade have flagella that are \"directly opposed\" (DO, 12\u20136 o'clock) e.g. [[Sphaeropleales]]. They are usually green due to the dominance of pigments [[chlorophyll a]] and [[chlorophyll b]]. The [[chloroplast]] may be [[wikt:discoid|discoid]], plate-like, [[reticulate]], cup-shaped, [[spiral]] or [[ribbon shaped]] in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called [[pyrenoid]]s located in the chloroplast. Pyrenoids contain protein besides [[starch]]. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made up of an inner layer of [[cellulose]] and outer layer of [[pectose]].\n\n==General characteristics==\n<!-- this section needs to be rewritten and cleaned up -->\n* Plant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous, or multicellular\n* They are usually green due to the dominance of chlorophyll A and B and beta carotene.\n* The pigments present in green algae are chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, beta- carotine.\n* The chloroplast may be discoid, cup-shaped(chlamydomonas), spiral or ribbon shaped(spyrogyra) in different species.\n* Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids(central protentious body covered with starch sheath) that are localised around the chloroplast.\n* Cell wall is made of cellulose {inner side} and the outer layer is from pectose.\n* [[Asexual reproduction]] is by zoospores. They are flagellates produced from the parent cells by mitosis.Also by aplanospores, hepnospores, akinetes, palmella stage etc.\n* [[Sexual reproduction of plants]] is by isogamus, anisogamus or oogamus\n* Starch is deposited on small bodies called pyrenoids\n\n==Reproduction==\nVegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation. Asexual reproduction is by flagellated [[zoospores]]. And haplospore, perrination (akinate and palmellastage). Asexual reproduction by mytospore absent in spyrogyra.\nSexual reproduction shows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and it may be [[isogamous]] e.g. ''Chlamydomonas, Spirogyara''. [[anisogamous]] e.g. ''Chlamydomonas'', ''Ulothrix'' or ''Ooulothrix'' e.g. ''Chlamydomonas'', ''Volvox'', ''Chara''.\n''Chlamydomonas'' has all three types of sexual reproduction.\n \nThey share many similarities with the higher plants, including the presence of asymmetrical flagellated cells, the breakdown of the nuclear envelope at mitosis, and the presence of phytochromes, flavonoids, and the chemical precursors to the cuticle.<ref>Raven, Evert and Eichhorn. ''The Biology of Plants'' 7th edition, pg. 335. W. H.

The computational complexity of a problem is the minimum of the complexities of all possible algorithms for this problem (including the unknown algorithms). \n\nAs the amount of needed resources varies with the input, the complexity is generally expressed as a function {{math|''n'' \u2192 ''f''(''n'')}}, where {{math|''n''}} is the size of the input, and {{math|''f''(''n'')}} is either the [[worst-case complexity]], that is the maximum of the amount of resources that are needed for all inputs of size {{math|''n''}}, or the [[average-case complexity]], that is average of the amount of resources over all input of size {{math|''n''}}.\n\nWhen the nature of the resources is not explicitly given, this is usually the time needed for running the algorithm, and one talks of [[time complexity]]. However, this depends on the [[computer]] that is used, and the time is generally expressed as the number of needed elementary operations, which are supposed to take a constant time on a given computer, and to change by a constant factor when one changes of computer.\n\nOtherwise, the resource that is considered is often the size of the memory that is needed, and one talks of [[space complexity]].\n\nThe study of the complexity of explicitly given algorithms is called [[analysis of algorithms]], while the study of the complexity of problems is called [[computational complexity theory]]. Clearly, both areas are strongly related, as the complexity of an algorithm is always an [[upper bound]] of the complexity of the problem solved by this algorithm.\n\n==Resources==\n===Time===\nThe resource that is most commonly considered is the time, and one talks of [[time complexity]]. When \"complexity\" is used without being qualified, this generally means time complexity.\n\nThe usual units of time are not used in [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], because they are too dependent on the choice of a specific computer and of the evolution of the technology. Therefore, instead of the real time, one generally consider the elementary operations that are done during the computation. These operations are supposed to take a constant time on a given machine, and are often called ''steps''.\n\n===Space===\nAnother important resource is the size of [[computer memory]] that is needed for running algorithms.\n\n===Others===\nThe number of [[arithmetic operations]] is another resource that is commonly used. In this case, one talks of '''arithmetic complexity'''. If one knows an [[upper bound]] on the size of the [[binary representation]] of the numbers that occur during a computation, the time complexity is generally the product of the arithmetic complexity by a constant factor.\n\nFor many algorithms the size of the integers that are used during a computation is not bounded, and it is not realistic to consider that arithmetic operations take a constant time. Therefore the time complexity, generally called [[bit complexity]] in this context, may be much larger than the arithmetic complexity. For example, the arithmetic complexity of the computation of the [[determinant]] of a {{math|''n''\u00d7''n''}} [[integer matrix]] is <math>O(n^3)</math> for the usual algorithms ([[Gaussian elimination]]). The bit complexity of the same algorithms is [[exponential function |exponential]] in {{mvar|n}}, because the size of the coefficients may grow exponentially during the computation. On the other hand, if these algorithms are coupled with [[modular arithmetic|multi-modular arithmetic]], the bit complexity may be reduced to [[soft O notation|{{math|''O''<sup>~</sup>(''n''<sup>4</sup>)}}]].\n\nIn [[sorting]] and [[search algorithm|searching]], the resource that is generally considered is the number of entries comparisons. This is generally a good measure of the time complexity if data are suitably organized.\n\n==Complexity as a function of input size==\n:''For clarity, only time complexity is considered in this section, but everything applies (with slight modifications) to the complexity with respect to other resources.'' \nIt is impossible to count the number of steps of an algorithm on all possible inputs. As the complexity increases generally with the size of the input, the complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size {{math|''n''}} (in [[bit]]s) of the input, and therefore, the complexity is a function of {{math|''n''}}. However, the complexity of an algorithm may vary dramatically for different inputs of the same size. Therefore several complexity functions are commonly used. \n\nThe [[worst-case complexity]] is the maximum of the complexity over all inputs of size {{mvar|n}}, and the [[average-case complexity]] is the average of the complexity over all inputs of size {{mvar|n}} (this makes sense, as the number of possible inputs of a given size is finite). Generally, when \"complexity\" is used without being further specified, this is the worst-case time complexity that is considered.\n\n==Asymptotic complexity==\n{{see also|Asymptotic computational complexity}}\nIt is generally difficult to compute precisely the worst-case and the average-case complexity. In addition, these exact values provide little practical application, as any change of computer or of model of computation would change the complexity somewhat. Moreover, the resource use is not critical for small values of {{mvar|n}}, and this makes that, for small {{mvar|n}}, the ease of implementation is generally more interesting than a good complexity.\n\nFor these reasons, one generally focuses on the behavior of the complexity for large {{mvar|n}}, that is on its [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic behavior]] when {{mvar|n}} tends to the infinity. Therefore, the complexity is generally expressed by using [[big O notation]]. \n\nFor example, the usual algorithm for integer [[multiplication]] has a complexity of <math>O(n^2),</math> this means that there is a constant <math>c_u</math> such that the multiplication of two integers of at most {{mvar|n}} digits may be done in a time less than <math>c_un^2.</math> This bound is ''sharp'' in the sense that the worst-case complexity and the average-case complexity are <math>\\Omega(n^2),</math> which means that there is a constant <math>c_l</math> such that these complexities are larger than <math>c_ln^2.</math> The [[radix]] does not appear in these complexity, as changing of radix changes only the constants <math>c_u</math> and <math>c_l.</math>\n\n==Models of computation==\nThe evaluation of the complexity relies on the choice of a [[model of computation]], which consist in defining the basic operations that are done in a unit of time. When the model of computation is not explicitly specified, this is generally meant as being [[multitape Turing machine]]. \n\n===Deterministic models===\nA [[deterministic model]] of computation is a model of computation such that the successive states of the machine and the operations to be performed are completely determined by the preceding state. Historically, the first deterministic models were [[\u03bc-recursive function|recursive function]]s, [[lambda calculus]], and [[Turing machine]]s. The model of [[Random access machine]]s (also called RAM-machines) is also widely used, as closer to real [[computer]]s.\n\nWhen the model of computation is not specified, it is generally the model of [[multitape Turing machine]]s. For most algorithms, the complexity is the same on multitape Turing machines and on RAM-machines, although, some care may be needed in storing data for getting this equivalence.\n\n===Non-deterministic computation===\nIn a [[non-deterministic algorithm|non-deterministic model of computation]], such as [[non-deterministic Turing machine]]s, some choices may be done at some steps of the computation. In complexity theory, one considers all possible choices simultaneously, and the non-deterministic time complexity is the time needed, when the best choices are always done. In other words, one considers that the computation is done simultaneously on as many (identical) processors as needed, and the non-deterministic computation time is the time spent by the first processor that finishes the computation. This parallelism is partly amenable to [[quantum computing]] via superposed [[entangled state]]s in running specific [[quantum algorithms]], like e.g. [[Shor's algorithm|Shor's factorization]] of yet only small integers ({{as of|2018|03|lc=\"yes\"}}: 21 = 3 \u00d7 7).\n\nEven when such a computation model is not realistic yet, it has theoretical importance, mostly related to the [[P = NP]] problem, which questions the identity of the complexity classes formed by taking \"polynomial time\" and \"non-deterministic polynomial time\" as least upper bounds. Simulating an NP-algorithm on a deterministic computer usually takes \"exponential time\". A problem is in the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], if it maybe solved in [[polynomial time]] on a non-deterministic machine. A problem is [[NP-complete]] if, roughly speaking, it is in NP and is not easier than any other NP problem. Many [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] problems, such as the [[Knapsack problem]], the [[travelling salesman problem]], and the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] are NP-complete. For all these problems, the best known algorithm has exponential complexity. If any one of these problems could be solved in polynomial time on a deterministic machine, then all NP problems could also be solved in polynomial time, and one would have P = NP. {{As of|2017}} it is generally conjectured that {{nowrap|P \u2260 NP,}} with the practical implication that the worst cases of NP problems are intrinsically difficult to solve, i.e., take longer than any reasonable time span (decades!) for interesting lengths of input.\n\n===Parallel and distributed computation===\n{{main|Parallel computing|Distributed computing}}\nParallel and distributed computing consist of splitting computation on several processors, which work simultaneously. The difference between the different model lies mainly in the way of transmitting information between processors. Typically, in parallel computing the data transmission between processors is very fast, while, in distributed computating, the data transmission is done through a [[computer network|network]] and is therefore much slower.\n\nThe time needed for a computation on {{mvar|N}} processors is at least the quotient by {{mvar|N}} of the time needed by a single processor. In fact this theoretically optimal bound can never be reached, because some subtasks cannot be parallelized, and some processors may have to wait a result from another processor. \n\nThe main complexity problem is thus to design algorithms such that the product of the computation time by the number of processors is as close as possible to the time needed for the same computation on a single processor.\n\n===Quantum computing===\nA [[quantum computer]] is a computer whose model of computation is based on [[quantum mechanics]]. The [[Church\u2013Turing thesis (complexity theory)|Church\u2013Turing thesis]] applies to quantum computers, that is, every problem that can be solved by a quantum computer may be also solved by a Turing machine. However, some problems may theoretically be solved with a much lower complexity using a quantum computer than using a classical computer. This is, for the moment, purely theoretical, as no one knows how to build an efficient quantum computer. \n\n[[Quantum complexity theory]] has been developed for studying computational complexity of quantum computing. It is used in [[post-quantum cryptography]], which consists of designing [[cryptographic protocol]]s that will resist to attacks with quantum computers, when such computers will really exist.\n\n==Problem complexity (lower bounds)==\nThe complexity of a problem is the [[infimum]] of the complexities of the algorithms that may solve the problem, including the unknowns algorithm. Thus the complexity of a problem is not greater than the complexity of any algorithm that solves the problems.\n\nIt follows that every complexity that is expressed with [[big O notation]] is a complexity of the algorithm as well as of the corresponding problem. \n\nOn the other hand, it is generally hard to obtain nontrivial lower bounds for problem complexity, and there are few methods for obtaining such lower bounds.\n\nFor solving most problems, it is required to read all input data, which, normally, needs a time proportional to the size of the data. Thus, such problems have a complexity that is at least [[linear time|linear]], that is, using [[big omega notation]], a complexity <math>\\Omega(n).</math>\n\nThe solution of some problems, typically in [[computer algebra]] and [[computational algebraic geometry]], may be very large. In such a case, the complexity is lower bounded by the maximal size of the output, since the output must be written. For example, a [[system of polynomial equations|system of {{mvar|n}} polynomial equations of degree {{mvar|d}} in {{mvar|n}} indeterminates]] may have up to <math>d^n</math> [[complex number|complex]] solutions, if the number of solutions is finite (this is [[B\u00e9zout's theorem]]). As these solutions must be written down, the complexity of this problem is <math>\\Omega(d^n).</math> For this problem, an algorithm of complexity <math>d^{O(n)}</math> is known, which may thus be considered as asymptotically quasi-optimal.\n\nA nonlinear lower bound of <math>\\Omega(n\\log n)</math> is known for the number comparisons needed for a [[sorting algorithm]]. Thus the best sorting algorithms are optimal, as their complexity is <math>O(n\\log n).</math> This lower bound results from the fact that there are {{math|''n''!}} ways of ordering {{mvar|n}} objects. As each comparison splits in two parts this set of {{math|''n''!}} orders, the number of {{mvar|N}} of comparisons that are needed for distinguishing all orders must verify <math>2^N>n!,</math> which implies <math>N =\\Omega(n\\log n),</math> by [[Stirling's formula]].\n\nA standard method for getting lower bounds of complexity consists of ''reducing'' a problem to another problem. More precisely, suppose that one may encode a problem {{mvar|A}} of size {{mvar|n}} into a subproblem of size {{math|''f''(''n'')}} of a problem {{mvar|B}}, and that the complexity of {{mvar|A}} is <math>\\Omega(g(n)).</math> Without loss of generality, one may suppose that the function {{mvar|f}} increases with {{mvar|n}} and has an [[inverse function]] {{mvar|h}}. Then the complexity of the problem {{mvar|B}} is <math>\\Omega(g(h(n))).</math> This is this method that is used for proving that, if [[P \u2260 NP]] (a unsolved conjecture), the complexity of every [[NP-complete problem]] is <math>\\Omega(n^k),</math> for every positive integer {{mvar|k}}.\n\n==Use in algorithm design==\n\nEvaluating the complexity of an algorithm is an important part of [[algorithm design]], as this gives useful information on the performance that may be expected. \n\nIt is a common misconception that the evaluation of the complexity of algorithms becomes less important, because of the exponential growth ([[Moore's law]]) of the power of modern [[computer]]s. This is wrong because, this power increase allows working with large input data ([[big data]]). For example, when one want to sort alphabetically a list of a few hundreds of entries, such as the [[bibliography]] of a book, any algorithm should work well in less than a second. On the other hand, for a list of a million of entries (the phone numbers of a large town, for example), the elementary algorithms that require <math>O(n^2)</math> comparisons would have to do a trillion of comparisons, which would need more than one day at the speed of a million of comparisons per second. On the other hand the [[quicksort]] and [[merge sort]] require only <math>n\\log_2 n</math> comparisons (as average-case complexity for the former, as worst-case complexity for the latter). For {{math|1=''n'' = 1,000,000}}, this gives approximately 30,000,000 comparisons, which may be done in a few seconds on a powerful computer.\n\nThus the evaluation of the complexity may allow eliminating many inefficient algorithms before any implementation. This may also be used for tuning complex algorithms without testing all variants. By determining the most costly steps of a complex algorithms, the study of complexity allows also focusing on these steps the effort for improving the efficiency of an implementation.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Computational complexity of mathematical operations]]\n==References==\n*{{Citation\n| last1=Arora | first1=Sanjeev | authorlink1=Sanjeev Arora\n| last2=Barak | first2=Boaz\n| title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach\n| url = http://www.cs.princeton.edu/theory/complexity/\n| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge]]\n| year=2009\n| isbn=978-0-521-42426-4\n| zbl=1193.68112\n}}\n* {{citation\n| last=Du\n| first=Ding-Zhu\n| author2=Ko, Ker-I\n| title=Theory of Computational Complexity\n| publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]\n| year=2000\n| isbn=978-0-471-34506-0\n}}\n* {{Garey-Johnson}}\n* {{Citation\n| last=Goldreich\n| first=Oded\n| authorlink=Oded Goldreich\n| url = http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/cc-book.html\n| title = Computational Complexity: A Conceptual Perspective\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| year = 2008\n}}\n* {{Citation\n| editor1-last=van Leeuwen\n| editor1-first=Jan\n| editor1-link = Jan van Leeuwen\n| title=Handbook of theoretical computer science (vol.

The threat of further harm may lead to the [[co-operation|cooperation]] or [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] of the person being coerced.\n\n==Overview==\nThe purpose of coercion is to substitute one's aims to those of the victim. For this reason, many social philosophers have considered coercion as the polar opposite to [[Political freedom|freedom]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wg1dvc2lfcEC&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=%22The+purpose+of+coercion+is+to+substitute+one's+aims+to+those+of+the+victim.+For+this+reason,+many+social+philosophers+have+considered+coercion+as+the+polar+opposite+to+freedom%22#v=onepage&q=%22The%20purpose%20of%20coercion%20is%20to%20substitute%20one's%20aims%20to%20those%20of%20the%20victim.%20For%20this%20reason,%20many%20social%20philosophers%20have%20considered%20coercion%20as%20the%20polar%20opposite%20to%20freedom%22&f=false|title=Textbook on Legal Language and Legal Writing|last=Bhatia|first=Prof Dr K. L.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Universal Law Publishing|isbn=9788175348943|language=en}}</ref>\n\nVarious forms of coercion are distinguished: first on the basis of the ''kind of injury'' threatened, second according to its ''aims'' and ''scope'', and finally according to its ''effects'', from which its legal, social, and ethical implications mostly depend.\n\n===Physical===\nPhysical coercion is the most commonly considered form of coercion, where the content of the conditional threat is the [[use of force]] against a victim, their relatives or property. An often used example is \"putting a gun to someone's head\" (''at gunpoint'') or putting a \"knife under the throat\" (''at knifepoint'' or cut-throat) to compel action or the victim gets killed or injured. These are so common that they are also used as metaphors for other forms of coercion.\n\nArmed forces in many countries use [[firing squad]]s to maintain [[discipline]] and intimidate the masses, or opposition, into submission or silent [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]]. However, there also are nonphysical forms of coercion, where the threatened injury does not immediately imply the use of force. Byman and Waxman (2000) define coercion as \"the use of threatened force, including the limited use of actual force to back up the threat, to induce an adversary to behave differently than it otherwise would.\"<ref>Byman, Daniel L.; Waxman, Matthew C.: ''Kosovo and the Great Air Power Debate'', ''[[International Security]]'', Vol. 24, No. 4 (Spring, 2000), pp. 5\u201338.</ref> Coercion does not in many cases amount to destruction of property or life since compliance is the goal.\n\n===Psychological===\nIn [[psychological coercion]], the threatened injury regards the victim's relationships with other people. The most obvious example is ''[[blackmail]]'', where the threat consists of the dissemination of damaging information. However, many other types are possible e.g. \"[[emotional blackmail]]\", which typically involves threats of rejection from or disapproval by a peer-group, or creating feelings of guilt/obligation via a display of anger or hurt by someone whom the victim loves or respects. Another example is [[coercive persuasion]].\n\nPsychological coercion \u2013 along with the other varieties \u2013 was extensively and systematically used by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] during the \"Thought Reform\" campaign of 1951\u20131952. The process \u2013 carried out partly at \"revolutionary universities\" and partly within prisons \u2013 was investigated and reported upon by [[Robert Jay Lifton]], then Research Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University: see Lifton (1961). The techniques used by the Chinese authorities included a technique derived from standard [[group psychotherapy]], which was aimed at forcing the victims (who were generally intellectuals) to produce detailed and sincere ideological \"confessions\". For instance, a professor of [[formal logic]] called Chin Yueh-lin \u2013 who was then regarded as China's leading authority on his subject \u2013 was induced to write: \"The new philosophy [of [[Marxism-Leninism]]], being scientific, is the supreme truth\" [Lifton (1961) p.&nbsp;545].\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abusive power and control]]\n* [[Coercive control]]\n* [[Coercive power]]\n* [[Deterrence (legal)]]\n* [[Duress in American law]]\n* [[Marital coercion]]\n* [[Monopoly on violence]]\n* [[Punishment (psychology)]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web | last=Anderson | first=Scott A. | date=n.d. | title=Towards a Better Theory of Coercion, and a Use for It | publisher=The University of Chicago | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308180431/http://ptw.uchicago.edu/Anderson02.pdf | accessdate=12 October 2018 }}\n* Lifton, Robert J.

A server [[Host (network)|host]]  runs one or more server programs which share their resources with clients. A client does not share any of its resources, but requests a server's content or service function. Clients therefore initiate communication sessions with servers which await incoming requests.\nExamples of computer applications that use the client\u2013server model are [[Email]], [[network printing]], and the [[World Wide Web]]\n\n==Client and server role==\nThe ''client-server'' characteristic describes the relationship of cooperating programs in an application. The server component provides a function or service to one or many clients, which initiate requests for such services.\nServers are classified by the services they provide. For example, a [[web server]] serves [[web page]]s and a [[file server]] serves [[computer file]]s. A shared resource may be any of the server computer's software and electronic components, from [[Computer program|programs]] and [[Data (computing)|data]] to [[Microprocessor|processors]] and [[Data storage device|storage devices]]. The sharing of resources of a server constitutes a ''service''.\n\nWhether a computer is a client, a server, or both, is determined by the nature of the application that requires the service functions. For example, a single computer can run web server and file server software at the same time to serve different data to clients making different kinds of requests. Client software can also communicate with server software within the same computer.<ref>The [[X Window System]] is one example.</ref> Communication between servers, such as to synchronize data, is sometimes called ''[[inter-server]]'' or ''server-to-server'' communication.\n\n==Client and server communication==\nIn general, a service is an [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] of computer resources and a client does not have to be [[Concern (computer science)|concerned]] with how the server performs while fulfilling the request and delivering the response. The client only has to understand the response based on the well-known application protocol, i.e. the content and the formatting of the data for the requested service.\n\nClients and servers exchange messages in a [[request\u2013response]] [[messaging pattern]]. The client sends a request, and the server returns a response. This exchange of messages is an example of [[inter-process communication]]. To communicate, the computers must have a common language, and they must follow rules so that both the client and the server know what to expect. The language and rules of communication are defined in a [[communications protocol]]. All client-server protocols operate in the [[application layer]]. The application layer protocol defines the basic patterns of the dialogue. To formalize the data exchange even further, the server may implement an [[application programming interface]] (API).<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Benatallah | first1 = B. | last2 = Casati | first2 = F. | last3 = Toumani | first3 = F. | title = Web service conversation modeling: A cornerstone for e-business automation | doi = 10.1109/MIC.2004.1260703 | journal = IEEE Internet Computing | volume = 8 | pages = 46 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> The API is an [[abstraction layer]] for accessing a service.  By restricting communication to a specific [[content format]], it facilitates [[parsing]]. By abstracting access, it facilitates cross-platform data exchange.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dustdar | first1 = S. | last2 = Schreiner | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1504/IJWGS.2005.007545 | title = A survey on web services composition | journal = International Journal of Web and Grid Services | volume = 1 | pages = 1 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/Staff/sd/papers/A%20survey%20on%20web%20services%20composition_Dustdar_Schreiner_inPress.pdf }}</ref>\n\nA server may receive requests from many distinct clients in a short period of time. A computer can only perform a limited number of [[Task (computing)|tasks]] at any moment, and relies on a [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] system to prioritize incoming requests from clients to accommodate them. To prevent abuse and maximize [[uptime|availability]], server software may limit the availability to clients. [[Denial of service attack]]s are designed to exploit a server's obligation to process requests by overloading it with excessive request rates.\n\n==Example==\nWhen a [[bank]] customer accesses [[online banking]] services with a [[web browser]] (the client), the client initiates a request to the bank's web server. The customer's [[login]] credentials may be stored in a [[database]], and the web server accesses the [[database server]] as a client. An [[application server]] interprets the returned data by applying the bank's [[business logic]], and provides the [[Input/output|output]] to the web server. Finally, the web server returns the result to the client web browser for display.  \n\nIn each step of this sequence of client\u2013server message exchanges, a computer processes a request and returns data. This is the request-response messaging pattern. When all the requests are met, the sequence is complete and the web browser presents the data to the customer.\n\nThis example illustrates a [[design pattern]] applicable to the client\u2013server model: [[separation of concerns]].\n\n==Early history==\nAn early form of client\u2013server architecture is [[remote job entry]], dating at least to [[OS/360]] (announced 1964), where the request was to run a [[job (computing)|job]], and the response was the output.\n\nWhile formulating the client\u2013server model in the 1960s and 1970s, [[computer scientist]]s building [[ARPANET]] (at the [[Stanford Research Institute]]) used the terms ''server-host'' (or ''serving host'') and ''user-host'' (or ''using-host''), and these appear in the early documents RFC 5<ref name=\"rulifson\">{{cite IETF |title=DEL |rfc=5 |last=Rulifson |first=Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Rulifson |year=1969 |month=June |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref> and RFC 4.<ref>{{cite IETF |title=Network Timetable |rfc=4 |last=Shapiro |first=Elmer B. |year=1969 |month=March |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref> This usage was continued at [[Xerox PARC]] in the mid-1970s.\n\nOne context in which researchers used these terms was in the design of a [[computer network programming]] language called Decode-Encode Language (DEL).<ref name=\"rulifson\"/> The purpose of this language was to accept commands from one computer (the user-host), which would return status reports to the user as it encoded the commands in network packets. Another DEL-capable computer, the server-host, received the packets, decoded them, and returned formatted data to the user-host. A DEL program on the user-host received the results to present to the user. This is a client\u2013server transaction. Development of DEL was just beginning in 1969, the year that the [[United States Department of Defense]] established [[ARPANET]] (predecessor of [[Internet]]).\n\n===Client-host and server-host===\n''Client-host'' and ''server-host'' have subtly different meanings than ''client'' and ''server''. A [[Host (network)|host]] is any computer connected to a network. Whereas the words ''server'' and ''client'' may refer either to a computer or to a computer program, ''server-host'' and ''user-host'' always refer to computers. The host is a versatile, multifunction computer; ''clients'' and ''servers'' are just programs that run on a host. In the client\u2013server model, a server is more likely to be devoted to the task of serving.\n\nAn early use of the word ''client'' occurs in \"Separating Data from Function in a Distributed File System\", a 1978 paper by Xerox PARC computer scientists Howard Sturgis, James Mitchell, and Jay Israel. The authors are careful to define the term for readers, and explain that they use it to distinguish between the user and the user's network node (the client).<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Separating Data from Function in a Distributed File System |last = Sturgis |first = Howard E. |last2 = Mitchell |first2 = James George |last3 = Israel | first3 = Jay E. |publisher=[[Xerox PARC]] |url=http://ip.com/IPCOM/000128883 |year = 1978}}</ref> (By 1992, the word ''server'' had entered into general parlance.)<ref>{{OEtymD|server|accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://getinfo.de/app/Separating-data-from-function-in-a-distributed/id/TIBKAT%3A509976956 |title=Separating data from function in a distributed file system |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=[[GetInfo]] |publisher=[[German National Library of Science and Technology]] |accessdate=29 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Centralized computing==\n{{Further|History of personal computers|Decentralized computing|Computer cluster}}\n\nThe client\u2013server model does not dictate that server-hosts must have more resources than client-hosts. Rather, it enables any general-purpose computer to extend its capabilities by using the shared resources of other hosts. [[Centralized computing]], however, specifically allocates a large amount of resources to a small number of computers. The more computation is offloaded from client-hosts to the central computers, the simpler the client-hosts can be.<ref name=\"Columbia\">{{cite journal |last = Nieh |first = Jason |last2 = Novik |first2 = Naomi |last3 = Yang |first3 = S.

A [[diskless node]] loads even its [[operating system]] from the network, and a [[computer terminal]] has no operating system at all; it is only an input/output interface to the server. In contrast, a [[fat client]], such as a [[personal computer]], has many resources, and does not rely on a server for essential functions.\n\nAs [[microcomputer]]s decreased in price and increased in power from the 1980s to the late 1990s, many organizations transitioned computation from centralized servers, such as [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]s and [[minicomputer]]s, to fat clients.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = d'Amore | first1 = M.

The computing power, memory and storage requirements of a server must be scaled appropriately to the expected work-load (''i.e.'', the number of clients connecting simultaneously).

They rank equally as first level [[local administrative unit]]s of the [[NUTS 3 statistical regions of the Republic of Ireland|NUTS 3]] Dublin Region for [[Eurostat]] purposes. There are 34 [[NUTS of the Republic of Ireland#Local administrative units|LAU 1]] entities in the Republic of Ireland. Each [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] is responsible for certain local [[Public services|services]] such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, the collection of motor taxation, local roads and [[social housing]].\n\nDublin County Council (which did not include the [[county borough]] of Dublin) was abolished in 1994 and the area divided among the administrative counties of [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]], [[Fingal]] and [[South Dublin]] each with its [[county town|county seat]]. To these areas may be added the area of Dublin city which collectively comprise the Dublin Region<ref name=\"r1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI394Y1993.html|title=Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993|accessdate=31 July 2009}}</ref> (''{{lang|ga|R\u00e9igi\u00fain \u00c1tha Cliath}}'') and come under the remit of the Dublin Regional Authority.\n\nThe area lost its administrative county status in 1994, with Section 9 Part 1(a) of the ''Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993'' stating that \"the county shall cease to exist.\"<ref>[[Act of the Oireachtas]]: [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0031/print.html#sec9 Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 (Section 9 Part 1(a))]</ref><ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0031/print.html#sec2 Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 Section 2] specifies: ''\"the county\", in relation to any time before the establishment day, means the administrative county of Dublin.''</ref> In discussing the legislation to dissolve Dublin County Council, [[Avril Doyle]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] said, \"The Bill before us today effectively abolishes County Dublin, and as one born and bred in these parts of Ireland I find it rather strange that we in this House are abolishing County Dublin.

For elections to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the area of the county is currently (2016) divided into eleven constituencies: [[Dublin Bay North (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin Bay North]], [[Dublin Bay South (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin Bay South]], [[Dublin Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin Central]], [[Dublin Fingal (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin Fingal]], [[Dublin Mid-West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin Mid-West]], [[Dublin North-West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin North-West]], [[Dublin Rathdown (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin Rathdown]], [[Dublin South-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin South-Central]], [[Dublin South-West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin South-West]], [[Dublin West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin West]], and [[D\u00fan Laoghaire (D\u00e1il constituency)|D\u00fan Laoghaire]]. Together they return 44 deputies ([[Teachta D\u00e1la|TDs]]) to the D\u00e1il.\n\nDespite the legal status of the Dublin Region, the term \"County Dublin\" is still in common usage. Many organisations and sporting teams continue to organise on a \"County Dublin\" or \"Dublin Region\" basis. The area formerly known as \"County Dublin\" is now defined in legislation solely as the \"Dublin Region\" under the ''Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993'',<ref name=\"r1\" /> and this is the terminology officially used by the four Dublin administrative councils in press releases concerning the former county area. The term ''[[Greater Dublin Area]]'', which might consist of some or all of the Dublin Region along with counties of [[County Kildare|Kildare]], [[County Meath|Meath]] and [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]], has no legal standing.\n\n===Dublin Region===\n[[File:Ireland location map Dublin region.svg|thumb|alt=|The Dublin region of Ireland with each constituent county/city council highlighted.]]\nThe '''Dublin Region''' is a [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] Level III [[List of regions of the Republic of Ireland|region]] of Ireland.

This resulted in the economy of the county expanding by almost 100% between the early 1990s and 2007. This growth resulted from incoming high-value industries, such as financial services and [[software manufacturing]], as well as low-skilled retail and domestic services, which caused a shift away from older manufacturing-industry.<ref name=\"IrishRegionOffice\"/> This change saw high unemployment in the 1980s and early 1990s which resulted in damage to the capitals social structure.<ref name=\"IrishRegionOffice\"/>\n\nAccording to CSO figures, the region had a GDP of \u20ac87.238 bn and a GDP per capita of \u20ac68,208 in 2014 (the second highest was Cork at \u20ac50,544 per capita).<ref>http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/cirgdp/countyincomesandregionalgdp2014/</ref> \n\nSeparately, Eurostat figures for 2012 suggested the region then had a GDP of \u20ac72.384 bn and a GDP per capita of \u20ac57,200 \u2013 the highest on the island of Ireland (the second highest being Cork with \u20ac48,500).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416165655/http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do |archivedate=16 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n\nAs of early 2017, the unemployment rate for the Dublin region was estimated at 6%.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/qnhs/quarterlynationalhouseholdsurveyquarter42016/ | publisher = Central Statistics Office |work = Quarterly National Household Survey | title = Table 9 Persons aged 15 years and over classified by NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions and ILO Economic Status|date = 21 February 2017 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n{{See also|Transport in Dublin}}\nCounty Dublin is the main transport node of Ireland,<ref name=\"IrishRegionOffice\"/> and contains one international airport, [[Dublin Airport]].

Whichever term is employed, there are three basic variants of the argument, each with subtle yet important distinctions: the arguments from [[Causality|''in causa'' (causality)]], [[Essence|''in esse'' (essentiality)]], and [[Becoming (philosophy)|''in fieri'' (becoming)]].\n\nThe basic premises of all of these are the concept of [[causality]]. The conclusion of these arguments is [[first cause]], subsequently deemed to be [[God]]. The history of this argument goes back to [[Aristotle]] or earlier, was developed in [[Neoplatonism]] and [[early Christianity]] and later in medieval [[Islamic theology]] during the 9th to 12th centuries, and re-introduced to medieval Christian theology in the 13th century by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. The cosmological argument is closely related to the [[principle of sufficient reason]] as addressed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Samuel Clarke]], itself a modern exposition of the claim that \"[[nothing comes from nothing]]\" attributed to [[Parmenides]].\n\n[[Contemporary philosophy|Contemporary]] defenders of cosmological arguments include [[William Lane Craig]],<ref name=craig-sinclair>{{cite book |last1=Craig |first1=William Lane |authorlink=William Lane Craig |last2=Sinclair |first2=James D. |editor1-last=Craig |editor1-first=William Lane |editor2-last=Moreland |editor2-first=J.

This required a \"self-originated motion\" to set it in motion and to maintain it. In ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', Plato posited a \"demiurge\" of supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the Cosmos.\n\nAristotle argued ''against'' the idea of a first cause, often confused with the idea of a \"[[Primum movens|prime mover]]\" or \"[[unmoved mover]]\" ({{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd \u1f00\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd}} or ''primus motor'') in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''.<ref>Aristotle, ''Physics'' VIII, 4\u20136; ''Metaphysics'' XII, 1\u20136.</ref> Aristotle argued in ''favor'' of the idea of several unmoved movers, one powering each [[celestial sphere]], which he believed lived beyond the sphere of the fixed stars, and explained why motion in the universe (which he believed was eternal) had continued for an infinite period of time. Aristotle argued the [[atomism|atomist's]] assertion of a non-eternal universe would require a [[first uncaused cause]] \u2014 in his terminology, an [[four causes|efficient]] first cause \u2014 an idea he considered a non-sensical flaw in the reasoning of the atomists.\n\nLike Plato, Aristotle believed in an eternal [[cosmos]] with no beginning and no end (which in turn follows [[Parmenides]]' famous statement that \"[[nothing comes from nothing]]\"). In what he called \"first philosophy\" or metaphysics, Aristotle ''did'' intend a theological correspondence between the prime mover and deity (presumably [[Zeus]]); functionally, however, he provided an explanation for the apparent motion of the \"[[fixed stars]]\" (now understood as the daily rotation of the Earth). According to his theses, immaterial unmoved movers are eternal unchangeable beings that constantly think about thinking, but being immaterial, they're incapable of interacting with the cosmos and have no knowledge of what transpires therein. From an \"aspiration or desire\",<ref>\"Cosmological Argument for the Existence of God\", in ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967), Vol. 2, p233 ''ff''.</ref> the [[celestial spheres]], ''imitate'' that purely intellectual activity as best they can, by [[uniform circular motion]]. The unmoved movers ''inspiring'' the [[classical planets|planetary]] spheres are no different in kind from the prime mover, they merely suffer a dependency of relation to the prime mover. Correspondingly, the motions of the planets are subordinate to the motion inspired by the prime mover in the sphere of fixed stars. Aristotle's natural theology admitted no creation or capriciousness from the immortal [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], but maintained a defense against dangerous charges of impiety.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n[[Plotinus]], a third-century Platonist, taught that the One transcendent absolute caused the universe to exist simply as a consequence of its existence (''creatio ex deo''). His disciple Proclus stated \"The One is God\".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nCenturies later, the [[Islamic]] [[philosopher]] [[Avicenna]] (c. 980\u20131037) inquired into the question of [[being]], in which he distinguished between [[essence]] (''Mahiat'') and [[existence]] (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence could not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves could not originate and interact with the movement of the Universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Thus, he reasoned that existence must be due to an [[Causality|agent cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must coexist with its effect and be an existing thing.<ref name=\"Islam in Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= | authorlink= | title=Islam |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-11-27|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam}}</ref>\n\nSteven Duncan writes that \"it was first formulated by a Greek-speaking Syriac Christian neo-Platonist, [[John Philoponus]],\" who claims to find a contradiction between the Greek pagan insistence on the eternity of the world and the Aristotelian rejection of the existence of any actual infinite.\" Referring to the argument as the \"'[[Kalam]]' cosmological argument\", Duncan asserts that it \"received its fullest articulation at the hands of [medieval] Muslim and Jewish exponents of ''Kalam'' (\"the use of reason by believers to justify the basic metaphysical presuppositions of the faith).\"<ref>Duncan, S., ''Analytic philosophy of religion: its history since 1955'', Humanities-Ebooks, p.165.</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225\u20131274) adapted and enhanced the argument he found in his reading of Aristotle and Avicenna to form one of the most influential versions of the cosmological argument.<ref>Summa Theologica, St. Thomas Aquinas</ref><ref>Scott David Foutz, [http://www.quodlibet.net/aqu5ways.shtml An Examination of Thomas Aquinas' Cosmological Arguments as found in the Five Ways], ''Quodlibet Online Journal of Christian Theology and Philosophy''</ref> His conception of First Cause was the idea that the Universe must be caused by something that is itself uncaused, which he claimed is that which we call God:    \"The second way is from the nature of the efficient cause.

There is no case known (neither is it, indeed, possible) in which a thing is found to be the efficient cause of itself; for so it would be prior to itself, which is impossible. Now in efficient causes it is not possible to go on to infinity, because in all efficient causes following in order, the first is the cause of the intermediate cause, and the intermediate is the cause of the ultimate cause, whether the intermediate cause be several, or only one. Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect. Therefore, if there be no first cause among efficient causes, there will be no ultimate, nor any intermediate cause. But if in efficient causes it is possible to go on to infinity, there will be no first efficient cause, neither will there be an ultimate effect, nor any intermediate efficient causes; all of which is plainly false. Therefore it is necessary to admit a first efficient cause, to which everyone gives the name of God.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/FP/FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1|title=Summa Theologica|author=|date=|website=www.dhspriory.org}}</ref>\n {{dubious|date=September 2014}}<!--this is just a repetition of Aristotle's concept.

The Five Ways form only the beginning of Aquinas' Treatise on the Divine Nature.\n\n== Versions of the argument ==\n\n=== Argument from contingency ===\n\nIn the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] era, [[Aquinas]] formulated the \"argument from [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]\", following [[Aristotle]] in claiming that there must be something to explain why the Universe exists.{{dubious|date=May 2017}}<!-- Aristotle did not believe in a first cause; is this a misreading? --> Since the Universe could, under different circumstances, conceivably ''not'' exist (contingency), its existence must have a cause \u2013 not merely another contingent thing, but something that exists by [[INUS|necessity]] (something that ''must'' exist in order for anything else to exist).<ref>''Summa Theologiae, I :'' 2,3</ref> In other words, even if the Universe has always existed, it still owes its existence to an [[Primum movens|uncaused cause]],<ref>Aquinas was an ardent student of Aristotle's works, a significant number of which had only recently been translated into Latin by [[William of Moerbeke]] .</ref> Aquinas further said: \"...and this we understand to be God.\"<ref>''Summa Theologiae, I : '' 2,3</ref>\n\nAquinas's argument from contingency allows for the possibility of a Universe that has no beginning in time. It is a form of argument from universal [[Causality|causation]]. Aquinas observed that, in nature, there were things with contingent existences. Since it is possible for such things not to exist, there must be some time at which these things did not in fact exist. Thus, according to Aquinas, there must have been a time when nothing existed. If this is so, there would exist nothing that could bring anything into existence. Contingent beings, therefore, are insufficient to account for the existence of contingent beings: there must exist a ''[[INUS|necessary]]'' being whose non-existence is an impossibility, and from which the existence of all contingent beings is derived.\n\nThe German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] made a similar argument with his [[principle of sufficient reason]] in 1714. \"There can be found no fact that is true or existent, or any true proposition,\" he wrote, \"without there being a sufficient reason for its being so and not otherwise, although we cannot know these reasons in most cases.\" He formulated the cosmological argument succinctly: \"Why is there something rather than nothing?  The sufficient reason [...] is found in a substance which [...] is a necessary being bearing the reason for its existence within itself.\"<ref>''Monadologie'' (1714). [[Nicholas Rescher]], trans., 1991. ''The Monadology: An Edition for Students''. Uni. of Pittsburg Press. [http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/leibmon.pdf Jonathan Bennett's translation.] [http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/classics/leibniz/monad.htm Latta's translation.]</ref>\n\n=== ''In esse'' and ''in fieri'' ===\n\nThe difference between the arguments from causation ''[[Becoming (philosophy)|in fieri]]'' and ''[[Essence|in esse]]'' is a fairly important one. ''In fieri'' is generally translated as \"becoming\", while ''in esse'' is generally translated as \"in essence\". ''In fieri'', the process of becoming, is similar to building a house. Once it is built, the builder walks away, and it stands on its own accord; compare the [[watchmaker analogy]]. (It may require occasional maintenance, but that is beyond the scope of the first cause argument.)\n\n''In esse'' (essence) is more akin to the light from a candle or the liquid in a vessel. George Hayward Joyce, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], explained that \"...where the light of the candle is dependent on the candle's continued existence, not only does a candle produce light in a room in the first instance, but its continued presence is necessary if the illumination is to continue. If it is removed, the light ceases. Again, a liquid receives its shape from the vessel in which it is contained; but were the pressure of the containing sides withdrawn, it would not retain its form for an instant.\" This form of the argument is far more difficult to separate from a purely first cause argument than is the example of the house's maintenance above, because here the First Cause is insufficient without the candle's or vessel's continued existence.<ref>Joyce, George Hayward (1922) ''Principles of Natural Theology''. NY: Longmans Green.</ref>\n\nThus, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]' argument is ''in fieri'', while [[Aquinas]]' argument is both ''in fieri'' and ''in esse''. This distinction is an excellent example of the difference between a [[deistic]] view (Leibniz) and a [[theistic]] view (Aquinas). As a general trend, the modern slants on the cosmological argument, including the [[Kalam cosmological argument|Kalam argument]], tend to lean very strongly towards an ''in fieri'' argument.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n=== Kal\u0101m cosmological argument ===\n{{Main|Kalam cosmological argument}}\nWilliam Lane Craig gives this argument in the following general form:<ref>{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William L. |title=The Existence of God and the Beginning of the Universe |work=Truth Journal |publisher=Leaderu.com |accessdate=22 June 2008 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/truth/3truth11.html }}</ref>\n# Whatever begins to exist has a cause.\n# The Universe began to exist.\n# Therefore, the Universe had a cause.\n\nCraig explains, by nature of the event (the Universe coming into existence), attributes unique to (the concept of) God must also be attributed to the cause of this event, including but not limited to: omnipotence, Creator, being eternal and absolute self-sufficiency. Since these attributes are unique to God, anything with these attributes must be God. Something does have these attributes: the cause; hence, the cause is God, the cause exists; hence, God exists.\n\nCraig defends the second premise, that the Universe had a beginning starting with [[Al-Ghazali]]'s proof  that an [[actual infinite]] is impossible. However, If the universe never had a beginning then there indeed '''would''' be an actual infinite, an infinite amount of cause and effect events. Hence, the Universe had a beginning.\n<!--\n# the form advocated by Aquinas based on the impossibility of the \"essential\" ordering of an infinite regress; Aquinas argues that  only an \"incidental\" ordering among causes, but not an \"essential\" ordering, can reach back forever.\n# the argument that an infinite regress is impossible because an [[actual infinite]] is impossible; this form is called the [[kalam cosmological argument]] by Craig, as he traces its first formulation to [[Al-Ghazali]].\n# the argument from the [[principle of sufficient reason]], presented by Leibniz and Clarke.\n\nA version of the cosmological argument could be stated as follows:\n\n# Every finite and [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] being has a cause.\n# A [[Causality|causal]] loop cannot exist.\n# A causal chain cannot be of infinite length.\n# Therefore, a First Cause (or something that is not an effect) must exist.\n-->\n\n===Metaphysical argument for the existence of God===\n\n[[Duns Scotus]], the influential Medieval Christian theologian, created a metaphysical argument for the existence of God. Though it was inspired by Aquinas' argument from motion, he, like other philosophers and theologians, believed that his statement for God's existence could be considered separate to Aquinas'. His explanation for God's existence is long, and can be summarised as follows:<ref>http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B</ref>\n#Something can be produced.\n#It is produced by itself, something or another.\n#Not by nothing, because nothing causes nothing.\n#Not by itself, because an effect never causes itself.\n#Therefore, by another ''A''.\n#If A is first then we have reached the conclusion.\n#If A is not first, then we return to 2).\n#From 3) and 4), we produce another- ''B''. The ascending series is either infinite or finite.\n#An infinite series is not possible.\n#Therefore, God exists.\n\nScotus deals immediately with two objections he can see: first, that there cannot be a first, and second, that the argument falls apart when 1) is questioned. He states that [[infinite regress]] is impossible, because it provokes unanswerable questions, like, in modern English, 'What is infinity minus infinity?' The second he states can be answered if the question is rephrased using [[modal logic]], meaning that the first statement is instead 'It is possible that something can be produced.'\n\n== Objections and counterarguments ==\n{{see also|M\u00fcnchhausen trilemma}}\n\n=== What caused the First Cause? ===\n{{The Works of Aristotle}}\nOne objection to the argument is that it leaves open the question of why the First Cause is unique in that it does not require any causes. Proponents argue that the First Cause is exempt from having a cause, while opponents argue that this is [[special pleading]] or otherwise untrue.<ref name=reichenbach/> Critics often press that arguing for the First Cause's exemption raises the question of why the First Cause is indeed exempt,<ref name=cline>{{cite web |last=Cline |first= Austin |title=Cosmological Argument: Does the Universe Require a First Cause? {{pipe}} Agnosticism/Atheism |publisher=About.com |accessdate=June 20, 2008 |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/argumentsforgod/a/cosmological.htm }}</ref> whereas defenders maintain that this question has been answered by the various arguments, emphasizing that none of its major forms rests on the premise that everything has a cause.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=07bHgxbG6A4C&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=curious+blind+spot+in+the+anglo+cause+everything&source=bl&ots=m3aujzj-la&sig=aYqS9OJfoATKgcskZ3NLi7BAvx0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=H9InVPvmJYvKaLPAguAO&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=curious%20blind%20spot%20in%20the%20anglo%20cause%20everything&f=false Clarke, WN., \"A Curious Blind Spot in the Anglo-American Tradition of Antitheistic Argument\", in ''The Creative Retrieval of Saint Thomas Aquinas: Essays in Thomistic Philosophy, New and Old'', Fordham Univ Press, 2009, Ch. 5.]</ref>\n\n[[William Lane Craig]], who famously uses the [[Kalam cosmological argument]], argues that, as the infinite is impossible, whichever perspective the viewer takes, there must always have been one unmoved thing to begin the universe. He uses [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]] and the question 'What is infinity minus infinity?' to illustrate the idea that the infinite is metaphysically, mathematically, and even conceptually, impossible. Other reasons include the fact that it is impossible to count down from infinity, and that, had the universe existed for an infinite amount of time, every possible event, including the final end of the universe, would already have occurred. He therefore states his argument in three points- firstly, everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence; secondly, the universe began to exist; so, thirdly, therefore, the universe has a cause of its existence. <ref>https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmological-argument/#4.3</ref> A response to this argument would be that the cause of the universe's existence (God) would need a cause for its existence, which, in turn, could be responded to as being logically inconsistent with the evidence already presented- even if God did have a cause, there would still necessarily be a cause which began everything, owing to the impossibility of the infinite stated by Craig.\n\nSecondly, it is argued that the premise of [[causality]] has been arrived at via ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' ([[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]) reasoning, which is dependent on experience. [[David Hume]] highlighted this [[problem of induction]] and argued that [[Causality|causal relations]] were not true ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. However, as to whether inductive or deductive reasoning is more valuable still remains a matter of debate, with the general conclusion being that neither is prominent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/dedind.php |title=Deduction & Induction |publisher=Socialresearchmethods.net |date=2006-10-20 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}</ref> Opponents of the argument tend to argue that it is unwise to draw conclusions from an extrapolation of causality beyond experience.<ref name=reichenbach/> Andrew Loke replies that, according to the [[Kalam Cosmological Argument]], only things which begin to exist require a cause. On the other hand, something that is without beginning has always existed and therefore does not require a cause. The Cosmological Argument shows that there cannot be an actual infinite regress of causes, therefore there must be an uncaused First Cause that is beginningless and does not require a cause. <ref> Andrew Loke, God and Ultimate Origins (Cham: Springer Nature, 2017), p. 189; Chapter 5.</ref>\n\n=== Not evidence for a theist God ===\nThe basic cosmological argument merely establishes that a First Cause exists, not that it has the attributes of a [[theistic]] god, such as [[omniscience]], [[omnipotence]], and [[omnibenevolence]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Cosmological Argument for the Existence of God |author=Austin Cline |publisher= About, Inc. |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=3 August 2016 |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/argumentsforgod/a/cosmological.htm }}</ref> This is why the argument is often expanded to show that at least some of these attributes are necessarily true, for instance in the modern Kalam argument given above.<ref name=reichenbach />\n\n=== Existence of causal loops ===\nA causal loop is a form of [[predestination paradox]] arising where traveling backwards in time is deemed a possibility. A sufficiently powerful entity in such a world would have the capacity to travel backwards in time to a point before its own existence, and to then create itself, thereby initiating everything which [[Logical consequence|follows from]] it.\n\nThe usual reason which is given to refute the possibility of a causal loop is it requires that the loop as a whole be its own cause. [[Richard Hanley]] argues that causal loops are not logically, physically, or epistemically impossible: \"[In timed systems,] the only possibly objectionable feature that all causal loops share is that coincidence is required to explain them.\"<ref>Richard Hanley, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/v436qxx802383534 No End in Sight: Causal Loops in Philosophy, Physics and Fiction], ''Synthese''</ref> However, Andrew Loke argues that causal loop of the type that is supposed to avoid a First Cause suffers from the problem of vicious circularity and thus it would not work.  <ref> Andrew Loke, ''God and Ultimate Origins'' (Cham: Springer Nature, 2017), chapter 4.</ref>\n\n=== Existence of infinite causal chains ===\n[[David Hume]] and later [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]] have invoked a similar principle in their criticisms of the cosmological argument. Rowe has called the principle the Hume-Edwards principle:<ref>Alexander R.

The [[Spline (mechanical)|splined]] hub is attached to the disc with springs to damp chatter.]]\n\nA '''clutch''' is a mechanical device which engages and disengages power transmission especially from [[drive shaft|driving shaft]] to driven shaft.\n\nIn the simplest application, clutches connect and disconnect two rotating shafts (drive shafts or [[line shaft]]s). In these devices, one shaft is typically attached to an engine or other power unit (the driving member) while the other shaft (the driven member) provides output power for work. While typically the motions involved are rotary, linear clutches are also possible.\n\nIn a torque-controlled [[drill]], for instance, one shaft is driven by a motor and the other drives a drill chuck. The clutch connects the two shafts so they may be locked together and spin at the same speed (engaged), locked together but spinning at different speeds (slipping), or unlocked and spinning at different speeds (disengaged).\n\n==Friction clutches==\n\n[[File:Car clutch.png|thumb|right|200px|A friction clutch]]\nThe vast majority of clutches ultimately rely on frictional forces for their operation. The purpose of friction clutches is to connect a moving member to another that is moving at a different speed or stationary, often to synchronize the speeds, and/or to transmit power. Usually, as little slippage (difference in speeds) as possible between the two members is desired.\n\n===Materials===\nVarious materials have been used for the disc-friction facings, including [[asbestos]] in the past. Modern clutches typically use a [[organic compound|compound organic]] resin with copper wire facing or a [[ceramic]] material. Ceramic materials are typically used in heavy applications such as racing or heavy-duty hauling, though the harder ceramic materials increase [[flywheel]] and pressure plate wear.\n\nIn the case of \"wet\" clutches, composite paper materials are very common.  Since these \"wet\" clutches typically use an oil bath or flow-through cooling method for keeping the disc pack lubricated and cooled, very little wear is seen when using composite paper materials.\n\n===Push/pull===\nFriction-disc clutches generally are classified as ''push type'' or ''pull type'' depending on the location of the pressure plate [[lever|fulcrum]] points. In a pull-type clutch, the action of pressing the pedal pulls the release bearing, pulling on the diaphragm spring and disengaging the vehicle drive. The opposite is true with a push type, the release bearing is pushed into the clutch disengaging the vehicle drive. In this instance, the release bearing can be known as a [[thrust bearing]] (as per the image above).\n\n===Dampers===\nA clutch damper is a device that softens the response of the clutch engagement/disengagement. In automotive applications, this is often provided by a mechanism in the clutch disc centres. In addition to the damped disc centres, which reduce driveline vibration, pre-dampers may be used to reduce gear rattle at idle by changing the natural frequency of the disc. These weaker springs are compressed solely by the radial vibrations of an idling engine. They are fully compressed and no longer in use once the main damper springs take up drive.\n\n===Load===\nMercedes truck examples:\nA clamp load of 33&nbsp;kN is normal for a single plate 430.  The 400 Twin application offers a clamp load of a mere 23&nbsp;kN. Bursts speeds are typically around 5,000&nbsp;rpm with the weakest point being the facing rivet.\n\n===Manufacturing===\nModern clutch development focuses its attention on the simplification of the overall assembly and/or manufacturing method.  For example, drive straps are now commonly employed to transfer torque as well as lift the pressure plate upon disengagement of vehicle drive. With regard to the manufacture of diaphragm springs, heat treatment is crucial. Laser welding is becoming more common as a method of attaching the drive plate to the disc ring with the laser typically being between 2-3KW and a feed rate 1m/minute.\n\n===Multiple plate clutch===\nThis type of clutch has several driving members interleaved or \"stacked\" with several driven members. It is used in racing cars including [[Formula One|Formula 1]], [[IndyCar]], [[World Rally Championship|World Rally]] and even most club racing. Multiplate clutches see much use in [[drag racing]], which requires the best acceleration possible, and is notorious for the abuse the clutch is subjected to. Thus, they can be found in [[motorcycle]]s, in [[automatic transmission]]s and in some [[diesel locomotive]]s with mechanical transmissions. It is also used in some electronically controlled [[AWD (vehicle)|all-wheel drive]] systems as well as in some transfer cases. They can also be found in some [[Heavy equipment|heavy machinery]] such as [[tank]]s and [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFV's]] ([[T-54/55|T-54]]) and earthmoving equipment ([[Loader (equipment)|front-end loaders]], [[bulldozer]]s), as well as components in certain types of [[Limited-slip differential|limited slip differentials]]. The benefit in the case of motorsports is that you can achieve the same total friction force with a much smaller overall diameter (or conversely, a much greater friction force for the same diameter, important in cases where a vehicle is [[Car tuning|modified]] with greater power, yet the maximum physical size of the clutch unit is constrained by the clutch housing). In motorsports vehicles that run at high engine[[drivetrain|/drivetrain]] speeds, the smaller diameter reduces [[Moment of inertia|rotational inertia]], making the drivetrain components accelerate more rapidly, as well as reducing the [[velocity]] of the outer areas of the clutch unit, which could become highly stressed and fail at the extremely high drivetrain rotational rates achieved in sports such as Formula 1 or drag racing. In the case of heavy equipment, which often deal with very high [[torque]] forces and drivetrain loads, a single plate clutch of the necessary strength would be too large to easily package as a component of the driveline.\n\nAnother, different  theme on the multiplate clutch is the clutches used in the fastest classes of drag racing, highly specialized, purpose-built cars such as [[Top Fuel|Top Fuel dragsters]] or [[Funny Car]]s. These cars are so powerful that to attempt a start with a simple clutch would result in complete loss of traction. To avoid this problem, Top Fuel cars actually use a single, fixed [[Transmission (mechanics)|gear ratio]], and a ''series'' of clutches that are engaged one at a time, rather than in unison, progressively allowing more power to the wheels. A single one of these clutch plates (as designed) can not hold more than a fraction of the power of the engine, so the driver starts with only the first clutch engaged. This clutch is overwhelmed by the power of the engine, allowing only a fraction of the power to the wheels, much like \"slipping the clutch\" in a slower car, but working not requiring concentration from the driver. As speed builds, the driver pulls a lever, which engages a second clutch, sending a bit more of the engine power to the wheels, and so on. This continues through several clutches until the car has reached a speed where the last clutch can be engaged. With all clutches engaged, the engine is now sending all of its power to the rear wheels. This is far more predictable and repeatable than the driver manually slipping the clutch himself and then shifting through the gears, given the extreme violence of the run and the speed at which is all unfolds. Another benefit is that there is no need to break the power flow in order to swap gears (a conventional manual cannot transmit power while between gears, which is important because 1/100ths of a second are important in Top Fuel races). A traditional multiplate clutch would be more prone to overheating and failure, as all the plates must be subjected to heat and friction together until the clutch is fully engaged, while a Top Fuel car keeps its last clutches in \"reserve\" until the cars speed allows full engagement. It is relatively easy to design the last stages to be much more powerful than the first, in order to ensure they can absorb the power of the engine even if the first clutches burn out or overheat from the extreme friction.\n\n===Wet vs. dry systems===\nA ''wet clutch'' is immersed in a cooling [[lubricating fluid]] that also keeps surfaces clean and provides smoother performance and longer life.  Wet clutches, however, tend to lose some energy to the liquid. Since the surfaces of a wet clutch can be slippery (as with a motorcycle clutch bathed in engine oil), stacking multiple clutch discs can compensate for the lower [[coefficient of friction]] and so eliminate slippage under power when fully engaged.\nThe [[Hele-Shaw clutch]] was a wet clutch that relied entirely on viscous effects, rather than on friction.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://folk.uib.no/ava004/vasiliev.pdf|title=From the Hele-Shaw Experiment to IntegrableSystems: A Historical Overview|publisher=University of Bergen|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\nA ''dry clutch'', as the name implies, is not bathed in liquid and uses friction to engage.\n\n===Centrifugal clutch===\nA [[centrifugal clutch]] is used in some vehicles (e.g., [[moped]]s) and also in other applications where the speed of the engine defines the state of the clutch, for example, in a [[chainsaw]]. This clutch system employs [[centrifugal force]] to automatically engage the clutch when the engine rpm rises above a threshold and to automatically disengage the clutch when the engine rpm falls low enough. See [[Saxomat]] and [[Variomatic]].\n\n===Cone clutch===\nAs the name implies, a [[cone clutch]] has conical friction surfaces. The cone's taper means that a given amount of movement of the actuator makes the surfaces approach (or recede) much more slowly than in a disc clutch. As well, a given amount of actuating force creates more pressure on the mating surfaces.\nThe best known example of a cone clutch is a [[Synchromesh|synchronizer ring]] in a manual transmission. The synchronizer ring is responsible for \"synchronizing\" the speeds of the shift hub and the gear wheel to ensure a smooth gear change.\n\n===Torque limiter===\nAlso known as a slip clutch or ''safety clutch'', this device allows a rotating shaft to slip when higher than normal resistance is encountered on a machine. An example of a safety clutch is the one mounted on the driving shaft of a large grass mower. The clutch yields if the blades hit a rock, stump, or other immobile object, thus avoiding a potentially damaging torque transfer to the engine, possibly twisting or fracturing the crankshaft.\n\nMotor-driven [[mechanical calculator]]s had these between the drive motor and gear train, to limit damage when the mechanism jammed, as motors used in such calculators had high stall torque and were capable of causing damage to the mechanism if torque wasn't limited.\n\nCarefully designed clutches operate, but continue to transmit maximum permitted torque, in such tools as controlled-[[torque screwdriver]]s.\n\n===Non-slip clutches===\nSome clutches are designed not to slip; torque may only be transmitted either fully engaged or disengaged to avoid catastrophic damage. An example of this is the [[dog clutch]], most commonly used in non-synchromesh transmissions.\n\n==Major types by application==\n\n===Vehicular (general)===\nThere are multiple designs of vehicle clutch, but most are based on one or more [[friction]] discs pressed tightly together or against a [[flywheel]] using [[spring (device)|springs]]. The friction material varies in composition depending on many considerations such as whether the clutch is \"dry\" or \"wet\". Friction discs once contained asbestos, but this has been largely discontinued. Clutches found in heavy duty applications such as trucks and competition cars use ceramic plates that have a greatly increased friction coefficient. However, these have a \"grabby\" action generally considered unsuitable for passenger cars. The spring [[pressure]] is released when the clutch pedal is depressed thus either pushing or pulling the diaphragm of the pressure plate, depending on type.  Raising the engine speed too high while engaging the clutch causes excessive clutch plate wear. Engaging the clutch abruptly when the engine is turning at high speed causes a harsh, jerky start.  This kind of start is necessary and desirable in [[drag racing]] and other competitions, where speed is more important than comfort.\n\n====Automobile powertrain====\n[[Image:PilotShaftGuideTool.jpg|thumb|right|This plastic pilot shaft guide tool is used to align the clutch disk as the spring-loaded pressure plate is installed. The transmission's drive splines and pilot shaft have a complementary shape. A number of such devices fit various makes and models of drivetrains.]]\n\nIn a modern [[automobile|car]] with a [[manual transmission]] the clutch is operated by the left-most [[Automobile pedal|pedal]] using a [[hydraulic]] or [[Wire rope|cable]] connection from the pedal to the clutch mechanism. On older cars the clutch might be operated by a mechanical linkage. Even though the clutch may physically be located very close to the pedal, such remote means of actuation are necessary to eliminate the effect of vibrations and slight engine movement, engine mountings being flexible by design.  With a rigid mechanical linkage, smooth engagement would be near-impossible because engine movement inevitably occurs as the drive is \"taken up.\"\n\nThe default state of the clutch is ''engaged'' - that is the connection between engine and gearbox is always \"on\" unless the driver presses the pedal and disengages it. If the engine is running with the clutch engaged and the transmission in neutral, the engine spins the input shaft of the transmission but power is not transmitted to the wheels.\n\nThe clutch is located between the engine and the gearbox, as disengaging it is usually required to change gear. Although the gearbox does not stop rotating during a gear change, there is no torque transmitted through it, thus less friction between gears and their engagement dogs. The output shaft of the gearbox is permanently connected to the [[final drive]], then the wheels, and so both always rotate together, at a fixed speed ratio. With the clutch disengaged, the gearbox input shaft is free to change its speed as the internal ratio is changed. Any resulting difference in speed between the engine and gearbox is evened out as the clutch slips slightly during re-engagement.\n\nClutches in typical cars are mounted directly to the face of the engine's [[flywheel]], as this already provides a convenient large diameter steel disk that can act as one driving plate of the clutch. Some racing clutches use small multi-plate disk packs that are not part of the flywheel. Both clutch and flywheel are enclosed in a conical [[bellhousing]], which (in a rear-wheel drive car) usually forms the main mounting for the gearbox.\n\nA few cars, notably the [[Alfa Romeo Alfetta]], [[Porsche 924]], and [[Chevrolet Corvette (C5)|Chevrolet Corvette]] (since 1997), sought a more even weight distribution between front and back<ref group=\"note\" >This more even weight distribution gives better handling, particularly for fast cornering. It offers much of the balance advantage of a mid-engined layout, whilst still using a front-engined rear-drive bodyshell.</ref> by placing the weight of the transmission at the rear of the car, combined with the rear axle to form a [[transaxle]]. The clutch was mounted with the transaxle and so the propeller shaft rotated continuously with the engine, even when in neutral gear or declutched.\n\n====Motorcycles====\n[[File:Basket clutch.png|thumb|right|200px|A basket clutch]]\nMotorcycles typically employ a wet clutch with the clutch riding in the same oil as the transmission. These clutches are usually made up of a stack of alternating friction plates and steel plates. The friction plates have lugs on their outer diameters that lock them to a basket that is turned by the crankshaft. The steel plates have lugs on their inner diameters that lock them to the transmission input shaft. A set of coil springs or a diaphragm spring plate force the plates together when the clutch is engaged.\n\nOn  [[motorcycle]]s the clutch is operated by a hand lever on the left handlebar.  No pressure on the lever means that the clutch plates are engaged (driving), while pulling the lever back towards the rider disengages the clutch plates through cable or hydraulic actuation, allowing the rider to shift gears or coast. Racing motorcycles often use [[slipper clutch]]es to eliminate the effects of [[engine braking]], which, being applied only to the rear wheel, can cause instability.\n\n====Automobile non-powertrain====\nCars use clutches in places other than the drive train. For example, a belt-driven engine cooling fan may have a heat-activated clutch.  The driving and driven members are separated by a silicone-based fluid and a valve controlled by a [[Bimetallic strip|bimetallic spring]]. When the temperature is low, the spring winds and closes the valve, which lets the fan spin at about 20% to 30% of the [[crankshaft|shaft]] speed. As the temperature of the spring rises, it unwinds and opens the valve, allowing fluid past the valve, makes the fan spin at about 60% to 90% of shaft speed. Other clutches\u2014such as for an [[air conditioning]] compressor\u2014electronically engage clutches using magnetic force to couple the driving member to the driven member.\n\n==Other clutches and applications==\n* Belt clutch: Used on agricultural equipment, lawn mowers, tillers, and snow blowers. Engine power is transmitted via a set of [[belt (mechanical)|belts]] that are slack when the engine is idling, but an idler pulley can tighten the belts to increase friction between the belts and the pulleys.\n* [[Dog clutch]]: Utilized in automobile manual transmissions mentioned above. Positive engagement, non-slip. Typically used where slipping is not acceptable and space is limited. Partial engagement under any significant load can be destructive.\n* [[Fluid coupling|Hydraulic clutch]]: The driving and driven members are not in physical contact; coupling is hydrodynamic.\n* [[Electromagnetic clutch]] are, typically, engaged by an electromagnet that is an integral part of the clutch assembly. Another type, ''magnetic particle clutches'', contain magnetically influenced particles in a chamber between driving and driven members\u2014application of [[direct current]] makes the particles clump together and adhere to the operating surfaces. Engagement and slippage are notably smooth.\n* Overrunning clutch or [[freewheel]]: If some external force makes the driven member rotate faster than the driver, the clutch effectively disengages. Examples include:\n** Borg-Warner [[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] transmissions in cars\n** Ratchet: typical bicycles have these so that the rider can stop pedaling and coast\n** An oscillating member where this clutch can then convert the oscillations into intermittent linear or rotational motion of the complimentary member; others use ratchets with the pawl mounted on a moving member\n** The winding knob of a camera employs a (silent) wrap-spring type as a clutch in winding and as a brake in preventing it from being turned backwards.\n** The rotor drive train in helicopters uses a freewheeling clutch to disengage the rotors from the engine in the event of engine failure, allowing the craft to safely descend by [[autorotation (helicopter)|autorotation]].\n*Wrap-spring clutches: These have a helical spring, typically wound with square-cross-section wire.  These were developed in the late 19th and early 20th century.<ref>Analdo M. English, Friction-Clutch, {{Patent|US|255957}}, granted Apr. 4 1882.</ref><ref>Charles C. Tillotson, Power-Transmission Clutch, {{Patent|US|850981}}, granted Apr. 23, 1907.</ref> In simple form the spring is fastened at one end to the driven member; its other end is unattached. The spring fits closely around a cylindrical driving member. If the driving member rotates in the direction that would unwind the spring the spring expands minutely and slips although with some drag.  Because of this, spring clutches must typically be lubricated with light oil. Rotating the driving member the other way makes the spring wrap itself tightly around the driving surface and the clutch locks up very quickly.  The torque required to make a spring clutch slip [[grows exponentially]] with the number of turns in the spring, obeying the [[capstan equation]].\n\n===Specialty clutches and applications===\n\n====Single-revolution clutch====\n\nSingle-revolution clutches were developed in the 19th century to power machinery such as [[Shear (sheet metal)|shears]] or [[Machine press|presses]] where a single pull of the operating lever or (later) press of a button would trip the mechanism, engaging the clutch between the power source and the machine's [[crankshaft]] for exactly one revolution before disengaging the clutch.  When the clutch is disengaged and the driven member is stationary.  Early designs were typically [[dog clutch]]es with a [[cam]] on the driven member used to disengage the dogs at the appropriate point.<ref>Frank Wheeler, Clutch and stop mechanism for presses, {{patent|US|470797}}, granted Dec. 14, 1891.</ref><ref>Samuel Trethewey, Clutch, {{patent|US|495686}}, granted Apr. 18, 1893.</ref>\n\nGreatly simplified single-revolution clutches were developed in the 20th century, requiring much smaller operating forces and in some variations, allowing for a fixed fraction of a revolution per operation.<ref>Fred. R. Allen, Clutch, {{patent|US|1025043}}, granted Apr. 30, 1912.</ref>  Fast action friction clutches replaced dog clutches in some applications, eliminating the problem of impact loading on the dogs every time the clutch engaged.<ref>John J. Zeitz, Friction-clutch, {{patent|US|906181}}, granted Dec. 8, 1908.</ref><ref>William Lautenschlager, Friction Clutch, {{patent|US|1439314}}, granted Dec. 19, 1922.</ref>\n\nIn addition to their use in heavy manufacturing equipment, single-revolution clutches were applied to numerous small machines.  In [[tabulating machine]]s, for example, pressing the operate key would trip a single revolution clutch to process the most recently entered number.<ref>Fred. M. Carroll, Key adding device for tabulating machines, {{patent|US|1848106}}, granted Mar. 8, 1932.</ref>  In [[Hot metal typesetting|typesetting machines]], pressing any key selected a particular character and also engaged a single rotation clutch to cycle the mechanism to typeset that character.<ref>Clifton Chisholm, Typesetting machine, {{patent|US|1889914}}, granted Dec. 6, 1932.</ref>  Similarly, in [[teleprinter]]s, the receipt of each character tripped a single-revolution clutch to operate one cycle of the print mechanism.<ref>Arthur H, Adams, Selecting and typing means for printing telegraphs, {{patent|US|2161840}}, issued Jun. 13, 1928.</ref>\n\nIn 1928, [[Frederick G. Creed]] developed a single-turn spring clutch (see above) that was particularly well suited to the repetitive start-stop action required in [[teleprinter]]s.<ref>[[Frederick G. Creed]], Clutch Mechanism, {{patent|US|1659724}}, granted Feb. 21, 1928</ref>  In 1942, two employees of [[Pitney Bowes|Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company]] developed an improved single turn spring clutch.<ref>Alva G. Russell, Alfred Burkhardt, and Samuel E. Calhoun, Spring Clutch, {{patent|US|2298970}}, granted Oct. 13, 1942.</ref>  In these clutches, a coil spring is wrapped around the driven shaft and held in an expanded configuration by the trip lever.  When tripped, the spring rapidly contracts around the power shaft engaging the clutch.  At the end of one revolution, if the trip lever has been reset, it catches the end of the spring (or a pawl attached to it) and the [[angular momentum]] of the driven member releases the tension on the spring. These clutches have long operating lives, many have cycled for tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of cycles without need of maintenance other than occasional lubrication.\n\n====''Cascaded-pawl'' single-revolution clutches====\n[[File:TTY-ASR-33-Clutch.jpg|thumb|Cascaded-pawl single-revolution clutch driving the [[cam]] cluster in a [[Teletype Model 33]] that performs fully mechanical conversion of incoming [[Asynchronous serial communication|asynchronous serial data]] to [[Parallel communication|parallel]] form.  The clutch drum, lower left, has been removed to expose the pawls and trip projection.]]\nThese superseded wrap-spring single-revolution clutches in page printers, such as [[teleprinter]]s, including the [[Teletype Model 28]] and its successors, using the same design principles. [[IBM Selectric typewriter]]s also used them.  These are typically disc-shaped assemblies mounted on the driven shaft. Inside the hollow disc-shaped drive drum are two or three freely floating pawls arranged so that when the clutch is tripped, the pawls spring outward much like the shoes in a [[drum brake]].  When engaged, the load torque on each pawl transfers to the others to keep them engaged.  These clutches do not slip once locked up, and they engage very quickly, on the order of milliseconds. A trip projection extends out from the assembly. If the trip lever engaged this projection, the clutch was disengaged. When the trip lever releases this projection, internal springs and friction engage the clutch. The clutch then rotates one or more turns, stopping when the trip lever again engages the trip projection.\n\n====''Kickback'' clutch-brakes====\nThese mechanisms were found in some types of synchronous-motor-driven electric clocks. Many different types of synchronous clock motors were used, including the pre-World War II Hammond manual-start clocks. Some types of self-starting synchronous motors always started when power was applied, but in detail, their behaviour was chaotic and they were equally likely to start rotating in the wrong direction. Coupled to the rotor by one (or possibly two) stages of reduction gearing was a wrap-spring clutch-brake. The spring did not rotate. One end was fixed; the other was free. It rode freely but closely on the rotating member, part of the clock's gear train. The clutch-brake locked up when rotated backwards, but also had some spring action. The inertia of the rotor going backwards engaged the clutch and wound the spring. As it unwound, it restarted the motor in the correct direction. Some designs had no explicit spring as such\u2014but were simply compliant mechanisms. The mechanism was lubricated and wear did not present a problem.\n\n====Lock-up clutch====\nA Lock-up clutch is used in some [[automatic transmission]]s for motor vehicles.

Scientific studies have been conducted to determine if cow tipping is theoretically possible, with varying conclusions.  All agree that cows are large animals that are difficult to surprise and will generally resist attempts to be tipped. Estimates suggest a force of between {{convert|3000|and|4000|N|abbr=off}} is needed, and that at least four and possibly as many as fourteen people would be required to achieve this. In real-life situations where cattle have to be laid on the ground, or \"cast\", such as for [[livestock branding|branding]], [[hoof]] care or veterinary treatment, either rope restraints are required or specialized mechanical equipment is used that confines the cow and then tips it over.  On rare occasions, cattle can lie down or fall down in proximity to a ditch or hill that restricts their normal ability to rise without help. Cow tipping has many references in popular culture and is also used as a [[figure of speech]].\n\n== Scientific study ==\n[[File:Cow lying on side in field.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|A healthy cow, lying on its side, is not immobilized; it can rise whenever it chooses.]]\nThe urban legend of cow tipping relies upon the presumption that cattle are slow-moving, dim-witted, and weak-legged, thus easily pushed over without much force.

However, cows are not rigid or unresponsive, and the faster humans have to move, the less force they can exert. Thus Lillie and Boechler concluded that it is unlikely that cows can actually be tipped over in this way.<ref name=\"Haines\" /> Lillie stated, \"It just makes the physics of it all, in my opinion, impossible.\"<ref name=collins />\n\nAlthough he agrees that it would take a force of about 3,000 newtons to push over a standing cow, biologist Steven Vogel thinks that the study by Lillie and Boechler overestimates the pushing ability of an individual human.<ref name=\"Vogel\" /> Using data from Cotterell and Kamminga, who estimated that humans exert a pushing force of 280 newtons,<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Cotterell |first1 = Brian |last2 = Kamminga |first2 = Johan |title = Mechanics of Pre-industrial Technology : Introduction to the Mechanics of Ancient and Traditional Material Culture |date = 1992 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Cambridge |isbn = 978-0-521-42871-2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0-xOM8y6Uc8C&vq |via = Google Books }}</ref> Vogel suggests that someone applying force at the requisite height to topple a cow might generate a maximum push of no more than 300 newtons. By this calculation, at least 10 people would be needed to tip over a non-reacting cow. However, this combined force requirement, he says, might not be the greatest impediment to such a prank. Standing cows are not asleep and like other animals have ever-vigilant reflexes. \"If the cow does no more than modestly widen its stance without an overall shift of its center of gravity\", he says, \"about 4,000 newtons or 14 pushers would be needed\u2014quite a challenge to deploy without angering the cow.\"<ref name=\"Vogel\">{{cite book |last = Vogel |first = Steven |title = Glimpses of Creatures in Their Physical Worlds |publisher = Princeton University Press |year = 2009 |page = 238 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qaOi_huPdfsC&dq |isbn = 978-0-691-13806-0 }}</ref>\n\n== Historical origins ==\n\nThe belief that certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has historical antecedents, though cattle have never been so classified.

She was seen as a liar and a madwoman by her family and by the Trojan people. In some versions of the story, she was often locked up in a pyramidal building on the citadel on the orders of her father, King Priam.

In various accounts of the war, she warned the Trojans about the Greeks hiding inside the Trojan Horse, [[Agamemnon]]'s death, her own demise at the hands of [[Aegisthus]] and [[Clytemnestra]], her mother Hecuba's fate, [[Odysseus]]'s ten-year wanderings before returning to his home, and the murder of Aegisthus and Clytemnestra by the latter's children [[Electra]] and [[Orestes]]. Cassandra predicted that her cousin [[Aeneas]] would escape during the fall of Troy and found a new nation in Rome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.html |title=The Internet Classics Archive &#124; The Aeneid by Virgil |publisher=Classics.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24}}</ref> However, she was unable to do anything to forestall these tragedies since no one believed her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/thetrojanwomenof10096gut/10096.txt |title=Full text of \"The Trojan women of Euripides\" |publisher=Archive.org |date=2003-11-16 |accessdate=2014-03-24}}</ref>\n\n[[Coroebus]] and [[Othronus]] came to the aid of Troy during the Trojan War out of love for Cassandra and in exchange for her hand in marriage, but both were killed.<ref name=\"illinois1\"/> According to one account, Priam offered Cassandra to [[Telephus]]\u2019s son [[Eurypylus (son of Telephus)|Eurypylus]], in order to induce Eurypylus to fight on the side of the Trojans.<ref> [[Dictys Cretensis]] 4.14 (Frazer, p. 95).</ref> Cassandra was also the first to see the body of her brother [[Hector]] being brought back to the city.\n\nIn ''The Fall of Troy'', told by [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], Cassandra had attempted to warn the Trojan people that Greek warriors hiding in the Trojan Horse while they were celebrating their victory over the Greeks with feasting. They disbelieved her, calling her names and degrading her with insults.<ref name=\"theoi1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/QuintusSmyrnaeus12.html |title=Classical E-Text: Quintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 12 |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24}}</ref> She grabbed an axe in one hand and a burning torch in her other, and ran towards the Trojan Horse, intent on destroying it herself to stop the Greeks from destroying Troy. The Trojan people stopped her before she could do so. The Greeks hiding inside the Horse were relieved that the Trojans had stopped Cassandra from destroying it, but they were surprised by how clearly she had seen their plan to defeat Troy.<ref name=\"theoi1\"/>\n\nAt the fall of Troy, Cassandra sought shelter in the temple of [[Athena]]. There she embraced the wooden statue of Athena in supplication for her protection, but was abducted and brutally raped by [[Ajax the Lesser]]. Cassandra was clinging so tightly to the statue of the goddess that Ajax knocked it from its stand as he dragged her away.<ref name=\"maicar1\"/> One account claimed that even Athena, who had worked hard to help the Greeks destroy Troy, was not able to restrain her tears and her cheeks burned with anger.  In one account, this caused her image to give forth a sound that shook the floor of the temple at the sight of Cassandra's rape, and her image turned its eyes away as Cassandra was violated, although others found this account too bold.<ref name=\"maicar1\"/> Ajax's actions were a sacrilege because Cassandra was a supplicant of Athena and supplicants were untouchable in the sanctuary of a god, being under the protection of that god. Furthermore, he committed another sacrilege by raping her inside the temple of Athena, despite it being strictly forbidden for people to have sexual intercourse in a temple.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rwaag.org/cassandra |title=Cassandra, Ancient Princess of Troy, Priestess and Prophetess|website=The Role of Women in the Art of Ancient Greece (Rwaag)|date=  |author= |accessdate= 3 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nOdysseus insisted to the other Greek leaders that Ajax should be stoned to death for his crimes, which had enraged Athena and the other gods. Ajax avoided their wrath, because none of them dared to punish him after he clung, as a supplicant, to Athena's altar and swore an oath proclaiming his innocence.<ref name=\"maicar1\"/> Athena was furious at the Greeks' failure to punish Ajax for raping Cassandra in her temple, and she punished them severely with the help of [[Poseidon]] and [[Zeus]]. Poseidon sent storms and strong winds to destroy much of the Greek fleet on their way home from Troy. Athena punished Ajax herself, by causing him to have a terrible death, although the sources differ as to [[Ajax the Lesser#Death|the manner of his death]]. The [[Locrians]] had to atone for Ajax's great sacrilege against Cassandra in Athena's temple by sending two maidens to Troy every year for a thousand years to serve as slaves in Athena's temple. However, if they were caught by the inhabitants before they reached the temple they were executed.<ref name=\"illinois1\"/>\n\nIn some versions, Cassandra intentionally left a chest behind in Troy, with a curse on whichever Greek opened it first.<ref name=\"maicar1\"/> Inside the chest was an image of [[Dionysus]], made by [[Hephaestus]] and presented to the Trojans by Zeus. It was given to the Greek leader [[Eurypylus (king of Thessaly)|Eurypylus]] as a part of his share of the victory spoils of Troy. When he opened the chest and saw the image of the god, he went mad.<ref name=\"maicar1\"/>\n\n=== Captivity and death ===\nCassandra was then taken as a [[concubine]] by King Agamemnon of [[Mycenae]]. Unbeknown to Agamemnon, while he was away at war, his wife, Clytemnestra, had begun an affair with Aegisthus. <!--Upon Agamemnon and Cassandra's arrival in Mycenae, [[Clytemnestra]] asked her husband to walk across a [[purple]] (some versions say red) tapestry, a sign of [[hubris]].  He initially refused, fearing the wrath of the gods, but gave in, ignoring Cassandra's warnings. By walking on the tapestries, he was committing sacrilege.-->  Clytemnestra and Aegisthus then murdered both Agamemnon and Cassandra. Some sources mention that Cassandra and Agamemnon had twin boys, Teledamus and Pelops, both of whom were killed by Aegisthus.\n\nCassandra was sent to the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] after her death, because her soul was judged worthy due to her dedication to the gods, and her religious nature during her life.<ref name=\"Westmoreland\">{{cite book|title=Ancient Greek Beliefs|last=Westmoreland|first=Perry L.|publisher=Lee & Vance Publishing Company|year=2007|isbn=9780979324819|location=San Ysidro, CA|pages=179}}</ref>\n\nCassandra was buried either at Amyclae or Mycenae.

Modern invocations of Cassandra are most frequently an example of a [[Cassandra complex]].  To emphasize such a situation, Cassandra's name is frequently used in fiction when prophecy comes up, especially true prophecy that is not believed.  This can include the names of people, objects, or places.\n\nCassandra has been used as metaphor and allegory in psychological and philosophical tracts.  For example, [[Florence Nightingale]]'s book ''Suggestions for Thought to Searchers after Religious Truth'' has a section named for Cassandra, using her as a [[metaphor]] for the helplessness of women that she attributes to over-feminization.  (Further examples are located on the [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra complex]] page.)\n\nThe Cassandra myth itself has also been retold several times by modern authors of novels and dramatizations, including works by [[Eric Shanower]], [[Lindsay Clarke]], [[Christa Wolf]], [[Lesya Ukrainka]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], [[David Gemmell]], and [[Hector Berlioz]].  A number of songs have also referred to her, such as \"[[Cassandra (ABBA song)|Cassandra]]\" (1982), by Swedish pop band [[ABBA]].\n<!---Please don't add specific examples here, it's unwieldy, it's not encyclopedic, and it adds nothing to the page.

A couplet usually consists of two successive lines that [[rhyme]] and have the same metre. A couplet may be formal (closed) or run-on (open).  In a formal (or closed) couplet, each of the two lines is end-stopped, implying that there is a grammatical pause at the end of a line of verse.  In a run-on (or open) couplet, the meaning of the first line continues to the second.<ref>\"couplet.\" [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 12 Nov. 2013</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe word \"couplet\" comes from the French word meaning \"two pieces of iron riveted or hinged together.\" The term \"couplet\" was first used to describe successive lines of verse in Sir P. Sidney's '' Arcadia '' in 1590: \"In singing some short coplets, whereto the one halfe beginning, the other halfe should answere.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/;jsessionid=21C3D384C49DB50A2116A667211BE681?authRejection=true&url=%2Fview%2FEntry%2F43139%3Frskey%3DnmXq3u%26result%3D47784|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=oed.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514183041/http://www.oed.com/;jsessionid=21C3D384C49DB50A2116A667211BE681?authRejection=true&url=%2Fview%2FEntry%2F43139%3Frskey%3DnmXq3u%26result%3D47784|archivedate=2018-05-14|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhile couplets traditionally rhyme, not all do. Poems may use white space to mark out couplets if they do not rhyme. Couplets in [[iambic pentameter]] are called ''[[heroic couplet]]s''. [[John Dryden]] in the 17th century and [[Alexander Pope]] in the 18th century were both well known for their writing in heroic couplets.  The [[Poetic epigram]] is also in the couplet form. Couplets can also appear as part of more complex [[rhyme scheme]]s, such as [[sonnet]]s.\n\nRhyming couplets are one of the simplest rhyme schemes in poetry.  Because the rhyme comes so quickly, it tends to call attention to itself. Good rhyming couplets tend to \"explode\" as both the rhyme and the idea come to a quick close in two lines. Here are some examples of rhyming couplets where the sense as well as the sound \"rhymes\":\n\n:: True wit is nature to advantage dress'd;\n:: What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd.\n:: \u2014 Alexander Pope\n\n:: Whether or not we find what we are seeking\n:: Is idle, biologically speaking.\n:: \u2014 [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] (at the end of a sonnet)\n\nOn the other hand, because rhyming couplets have such a predictable rhyme scheme, they can feel artificial and plodding. Here is a Pope parody of the predictable rhymes of his era:\n:: Where-e'er you find \"the cooling western breeze,\"\n:: In the next line, it \"whispers through the trees;\"\n:: If crystal streams \"with pleasing murmurs creep,\"\n:: The reader's threatened (not in vain) with \"sleep.\"\n\n==In English poetry==\nRhyming couplets are often used in [[Early Modern English]] poetry, as seen in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.  This work of literature is written almost entirely in rhyming couplets.  Similarly, [[Shakespearean]] [[sonnet]]s often employ rhyming couplets at the end to emphasize the theme. Take one of Shakespeare's most famous sonnets, [[Sonnet 18]], for example (the rhyming couplet is shown in italics):\n\n:: Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\n:: Thou art more lovely and more temperate:\n:: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\n:: And summer's lease hath all too short a date:\n:: Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines,\n:: And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;\n:: And every fair from fair sometime declines,\n:: By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;\n:: But thy eternal summer shall not fade\n:: Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;\n:: Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\n:: When in eternal lines to time thou growest:\n:: ''So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,''\n:: ''So long lives this and this gives life to thee.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sonnets/18.html|title=Shakespeare Sonnet 18 - Shall I compare thee to a summer's day|first=Amanda|last=Mabillard|date=|website=www.shakespeare-online.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112213943/http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sonnets/18.html|archivedate=2013-11-12|df=}}</ref>\n\n==In Chinese poetry==\n[[File:Chinese Marks Door.JPG|thumb|A Chinese couplet on doorway]]\n[[Chinese couplet]]s or \"contrapuntal couplets\" may be seen on doorways in Chinese communities worldwide. Couplets displayed as part of the [[Chinese New Year]] festival, on the first morning of the New Year, are called ''chunlian'' (\u6625\u8054). These are usually purchased at a market a few days before and glued to the doorframe. The text of the couplets is often traditional and contains hopes for prosperity. Other chunlian reflect more recent concerns. For example, the [[CCTV New Year's Gala]] usually promotes couplets reflecting current political themes in [[mainland China]].\n\nSome Chinese couplets may consist of two lines of four [[Chinese character|characters]] each.  Couplets are read from top to bottom where the first pline starts from the right. But is also a 6 word diagraph with 19 lines\n\n==In Tamil poetry==\n[[Tamil literature]] contains some of the best known examples of ancient couplet poetry. The [[Tamil language]] has a rich and refined grammar for couplet poetry, and distichs in Tamil poetry follow the [[venpa]] metre.<ref name=\"Zvelebil1973\">{{cite book|author=Kamil Zvelebil|title=The smile of Murugan: On Tamil literature of South India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VF2VMUoY_okC&pg=PA156|accessdate=11 December 2010|year=1973|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-03591-1|pages=156\u2013171}}</ref> The most famous example for Tamil couplet poetry is the ancient Tamil moral text of [[Tirukkural]], which contains a total of 1330 couplets written in the [[kural (poetic form)|kural venpa]] metre from which the title of the work was derived centuries later.

She left the year after to teach her sisters, [[Emily Bront\u00eb|Emily]] and [[Anne Bront\u00eb|Anne]], at home, returning in 1835 as a governess. In 1839 she undertook the role as governess for the Sidgwick family, but left after a few months to return to Haworth where the sisters opened a school, but failed to attract pupils. Instead they turned to writing and they each first published in 1846 under the pseudonyms of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. Her first novel ''[[The Professor (novel)|The Professor]]'' was rejected by publishers, her second novel ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' was published in 1847. The sisters admitted to their Bell pseudonyms in 1848, and by the following year were celebrated in London literary circles.\n\nBront\u00eb experienced the early deaths of all her siblings. She became pregnant shortly after her marriage in June 1854 but died on 31 March 1855 of [[tuberculosis]] or possibly [[typhus]].\n\n==Early years and education==\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb was born on 21 April 1816 in Market Street [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]], west of [[Bradford]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], the third of the six children of [[Maria Branwell|Maria]] (n\u00e9e Branwell) and [[Patrick Bront\u00eb]] (formerly surnamed Brunty), an Irish [[Anglican]] clergyman. In 1820 [[Bront\u00eb family|her family]] moved a few miles to the village of [[Haworth]], where her father had been appointed [[perpetual curate]] of [[St Michael and All Angels' Church, Haworth|St Michael and All Angels Church]]. Maria died of cancer on 15 September 1821, leaving five daughters, Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, [[Emily Bront\u00eb|Emily]] and [[Anne Bront\u00eb|Anne]], and a son, [[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Branwell]], to be taken care of by her sister, [[Elizabeth Branwell]].\n\nIn August 1824 Patrick sent Charlotte, Emily, Maria and Elizabeth to the [[Cowan Bridge School|Clergy Daughters' School]] at [[Cowan Bridge]] in Lancashire. Charlotte maintained that the school's poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development, and hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died of [[tuberculosis]] in June 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters, Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school.{{sfn|Fraser|2008|p=261}} Charlotte used the school as the basis for Lowood School in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''.\n\nAt home in [[Haworth Parsonage]], Bront\u00eb acted as \"the motherly friend and guardian of her younger sisters\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Cousin|first=John|title=A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature|year=1910|publisher=E.P.

Charlotte and Branwell wrote [[Lord Byron|Byronic]] stories about their jointly imagined country, Angria, and Emily and Anne wrote articles and poems about [[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]]. The sagas they created were episodic and elaborate, and they exist in incomplete manuscripts, some of which have been published as juvenilia.

During her time in Brussels, Bront\u00eb, who favoured the [[Protestant]] ideal of an individual in direct contact with God, objected to the stern [[Catholicism]] of Madame H\u00e9ger, which she considered a tyrannical religion that enforced conformity and submission to the Pope.{{sfn|Paddock|Rollyson|2003|p=29}} In return for board and tuition Charlotte taught English and Emily taught music. Their time at the school was cut short when their aunt Elizabeth Branwell, who had joined the family in Haworth to look after the children after their mother's death, died of [[Bowel obstruction|internal obstruction]] in October 1842. Charlotte returned alone to Brussels in January 1843 to take up a teaching post at the school. Her second stay was not happy: she was homesick and deeply attached to Constantin H\u00e9ger. She returned to Haworth in January 1844 and used the time spent in Brussels as the inspiration for some of the events in ''[[The Professor (novel)|The Professor]]'' and ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]''.\n\n==First publication==\nIn May 1846 Charlotte, Emily and Anne self-financed the publication of a joint collection of poems under their assumed names Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. The pseudonyms veiled the sisters' sex while preserving their initials; thus Charlotte was Currer Bell. \"Bell\" was the middle name of Haworth's curate, [[Arthur Bell Nicholls]] whom Charlotte later married, and \"Currer\" was the surname of [[Frances Mary Richardson Currer]] who had funded their school (and maybe their father).<ref name=odnb>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Colin |last=Lee|title= Currer, Frances Mary Richardson (1785\u20131861)|encyclopedia= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6951| accessdate= 1 November 2014}}</ref> Of the decision to use ''noms de plume'', Charlotte wrote:\n{{quote| Averse to personal publicity, we veiled our own names under those of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell; the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women, because&nbsp;\u2013 without at that time suspecting that our mode of writing and thinking was not what is called \"feminine\"&nbsp;\u2013 we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice; we had noticed how critics sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of personality, and for their reward, a flattery, which is not true praise.<ref>\"Biographical Notice of Ellis And Acton Bell\", from the preface to the 1910 edition of ''Wuthering Heights''.</ref>}}\nAlthough only two copies of the collection of poems were sold, the sisters continued writing for publication and began their first novels, continuing to use their ''noms de plume'' when sending manuscripts to potential publishers.\n\n==''The Professor'' and ''Jane Eyre''==\n{{main|Jane Eyre}}\n[[File:Jane Eyre title page.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of the first edition of ''[[Jane Eyre]]'']]\nBront\u00eb's first manuscript, ''The Professor'', did not secure a publisher, although she was heartened by an encouraging response from [[Smith, Elder & Co.]] of Cornhill, who expressed an interest in any longer works Currer Bell might wish to send.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=14}} Bront\u00eb responded by finishing and sending a second manuscript in August 1847. Six weeks later, ''Jane Eyre'' was published. It tells the story of a plain governess, Jane, who, after difficulties in her early life, falls in love with her employer, Mr Rochester. They marry, but only after Rochester's insane first wife, of whom Jane initially has no knowledge, dies in a dramatic house fire. The book's style was innovative, combining [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] with [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] [[melodrama]], and broke new ground in being written from an intensely evoked first-person female perspective.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pp=12\u201313}} Bront\u00eb believed art was most convincing when based on personal experience; in ''Jane Eyre'' she transformed the experience into a novel with universal appeal.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=13}}\n\n''Jane Eyre'' had immediate commercial success and initially received favourable reviews. [[George Henry Lewes|G. H. Lewes]] wrote that it was \"an utterance from the depths of a struggling, suffering, much-enduring spirit\", and declared that it consisted of \"''suspiria de profundis''!\" (sighs from the depths).{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=13}} Speculation about the identity and gender of the mysterious Currer Bell heightened with the publication of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' by Ellis Bell (Emily) and ''Agnes Grey'' by Acton Bell (Anne).{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=15}} Accompanying the speculation was a change in the critical reaction to Bront\u00eb's work, as accusations were made that the writing was \"coarse\",{{sfn|Fraser|2008|p=24}} a judgement more readily made once it was suspected that Currer Bell was a woman.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=17}} However, sales of ''Jane Eyre'' continued to be strong and may even have increased as a result of the novel developing a reputation as an \"improper\" book.<ref>''North American Review'', October 1848, cited in ''The Bront\u00ebs: The Critical Heritage'' by Allott, M.

It was only partially completed when the Bront\u00eb family suffered the deaths of three of its members within eight months. In September 1848 Branwell died of [[chronic bronchitis]] and [[marasmus]], exacerbated by heavy drinking, although Bront\u00eb believed that his death was due to [[tuberculosis]]. Branwell may have had a [[laudanum]] addiction. Emily became seriously ill shortly after his funeral and died of pulmonary tuberculosis in December 1848. Anne died of the same disease in May 1849.

Lewes. She never left Haworth for more than a few weeks at a time, as she did not want to leave her ageing father. Thackeray's daughter, writer [[Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie]], recalled a visit to her father by Bront\u00eb:\n{{quote|... two gentlemen come in, leading a tiny, delicate, serious, little lady, with fair straight hair and steady eyes. She may be a little over thirty; she is dressed in a little ''[[wikt:bar\u00e8ge|bar\u00e8ge]]'' dress with a pattern of faint green moss. She enters in mittens, in silence, in seriousness; our hearts are beating with wild excitement. This then is the authoress, the unknown power whose books have set all London talking, reading, speculating; some people even say our father wrote the books&nbsp;\u2013 the wonderful books. ...  The moment is so breathless that dinner comes as a relief to the solemnity of the occasion, and we all smile as my father stoops to offer his arm; for, genius though she may be, Miss Bront\u00eb can barely reach his elbow. My own personal impressions are that she is somewhat grave and stern, specially to forward little girls who wish to chatter. ...  Everyone waited for the brilliant conversation which never began at all. Miss Bront\u00eb retired to the sofa in the study, and murmured a low word now and then to our kind governess ... the conversation grew dimmer and more dim, the ladies sat round still expectant, my father was too much perturbed by the gloom and the silence to be able to cope with it at all ... after Miss Bront\u00eb had left, I was surprised to see my father opening the front door with his hat on. He put his fingers to his lips, walked out into the darkness, and shut the door quietly behind him ... long afterwards ... Mrs Procter asked me if I knew what had happened. ... It was one of the dullest evenings [Mrs Procter] had ever spent in her life ... the ladies who had all come expecting so much delightful conversation, and the gloom and the constraint, and how finally, overwhelmed by the situation, my father had quietly left the room, left the house, and gone off to his club.<ref>Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie.

OUP, 1975. {{ISBN|0-19-812139-3}}.</ref>}}\nBront\u00eb's friendship with Elizabeth Gaskell, while not particularly close, was significant in that Gaskell wrote the first biography of Bront\u00eb after her death in 1855.\n\n==''Villette''==\nBront\u00eb's third novel, the last published in her lifetime, was ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'', which appeared in 1853. Its main themes include isolation, how such a condition can be borne,<ref>{{cite book|last=Reid Banks|first= L.|title=Path to the Silent Country|publisher= Penguin|year= 1977|page=113}}</ref> and the internal conflict brought about by social repression of individual desire.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=47}} Its main character, Lucy Snowe, travels abroad to teach in a boarding school in the fictional town of Villette, where she encounters a culture and religion different from her own, and falls in love with a man (Paul Emanuel) whom she cannot marry. Her experiences result in a breakdown but eventually she achieves independence and fulfilment through running her own school. A substantial amount of the novel's dialogue is in the French language. ''Villette'' marked Bront\u00eb's return to writing from a first-person perspective (that of Lucy Snowe); the technique she had used in ''Jane Eyre''. Another similarity to ''Jane Eyre'' lies in the use of aspects of her own life as inspiration for fictional events;{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=47}} in particular her reworking of the time she spent at the ''pensionnat'' in Brussels. ''Villette'' was acknowledged by critics of the day as a potent and sophisticated piece of writing although it was criticised for \"coarseness\" and for not being suitably \"feminine\" in its portrayal of Lucy's desires.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=52}}\n\n==Marriage==\nBefore the publication of ''Villette'', Bront\u00eb received an expected proposal of marriage from [[Arthur Bell Nicholls]], her father's [[curate]], who had long been in love with her.{{sfn|Paddock|Rollyson|2003|p=19}} She initially turned down his proposal and her father objected to the union at least partly because of Nicholls's poor financial status. Elizabeth Gaskell, who believed that marriage provided \"clear and defined duties\" that were beneficial for a woman,{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=54}} encouraged Bront\u00eb to consider the positive aspects of such a union and tried to use her contacts to engineer an improvement in Nicholls's finances. Bront\u00eb meanwhile was increasingly attracted to Nicholls and by January 1854 she had accepted his proposal. They gained the approval of her father by April and married in June.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pp=54\u201355}} Her father Patrick had intended to give Charlotte away, but at the last minute decided he could not, and Charlotte had to make her way to the church without him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03n0wsy/p03n0s7x|title=Being the Brontes \u2013 Charlotte Bronte's marriage with The Rev.

It was an important step for a leading female novelist to write a biography of another,{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=57}} and Gaskell's approach was unusual in that, rather than analysing her subject's achievements, she concentrated on private details of Bront\u00eb's life, emphasising those aspects that countered the accusations of \"coarseness\" that had been levelled at her writing.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=57}} The biography is frank in places, but omits details of Bront\u00eb's love for H\u00e9ger, a married man, as being too much of an affront to contemporary morals and a likely source of distress to Bront\u00eb's father, widower, and friends.{{sfn|Lane|1953|pp= 178\u201383}} Mrs Gaskell also provided doubtful and inaccurate information about Patrick Bront\u00eb, claiming that he did not allow his children to eat meat.

September 1886 \u2013 15 May 1945) was a British poet, novelist, playwright, theologian, literary critic, and member of the [[Inklings]].\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWilliams was born in London in 1886, the only son of (Richard) Walter Stansby Williams (1848\u20131929), a journalist and foreign business correspondent for an importing firm, writing in French and German,<ref>{{cite web |last=

He had one sister, Edith, born in 1889. The Williams family lived in 'shabby-genteel' circumstances, owing to Walter's increasing blindness and the decline of the firm by which he was employed, in Holloway.<ref name= \"Charles Williams 2015, pg 6\" />\n\nIn 1894 the family moved to [[St Albans]] in [[Hertfordshire]], where Williams lived until his marriage in 1917.<ref>[http://www.blueplaqueplaces.co.uk/charles-williams-blue-plaque-in-st-albans-4732#.WqaeL5pLGM9] Charles Williams blue plaque in St Albans</ref>\n\nEducated at [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)|St Albans School]], Williams was awarded a scholarship to [[University College London]], but he left school in 1904 without attempting to gain a degree due to an inability to pay tuition fees.\n\n==Career==\nNo longer in college, Williams began work in 1904 in a [[Methodist]] [[bookroom]]. He was hired by the [[Oxford University Press]] (OUP) as a proofreading assistant in 1908 and quickly climbed to the position of editor. He continued to work at the OUP in various positions of increasing responsibility until his death in 1945. One of his greatest editorial achievements was the publication of the first major English-language edition of the works of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]].<ref>{{Citation | url = https://dspace.lasrworks.org/bitstream/handle/10349/770/From%20a%20Publisher%27s%20Point%20of%20View.pdf?sequence=1 | contribution = From a Publisher's Point of View: Charles Williams\u2019s Role in Publishing Kierkegaard in English | first = Michael J., Jr. | last = Paulus | editor1-first = Suzanne | editor1-last = Bray | editor2-first = Richard | editor2-last = Sturch | title = Charles Williams and His Contemporaries | place = Newcastle, UK | publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing | year = 2009 | ISBN = 978-1-4438-0565-0 | format = [[PDF]]}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough chiefly remembered as a novelist, Williams also published poetry, works of literary criticism, theology, drama, history, biography, and a voluminous number of book reviews. Some of his best known novels are ''War in Heaven'' (1930), ''[[Descent into Hell (novel)|Descent into Hell]]'' (1937), and ''All Hallows' Eve'' (1945).<ref>{{cite journal | first= David N.| last= Samuelson | title= Charles Williams | editor1-first= E.F. | editor1-last= Bleiler| editor1-link= E.

Eliot]], who wrote an introduction for the last of these, described Williams's novels as \"supernatural thrillers\" because they explore the sacramental intersection of the physical with the spiritual while also examining the ways in which power, even spiritual power, can corrupt as well as sanctify. All of Williams's fantasies, unlike those of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and most of those of [[C. S. Lewis]], are set in the contemporary world. Williams has been described by [[Colin Manlove]] as one of the three main writers of \"Christian fantasy\" in the twentieth century (the other two being C.S. Lewis and [[T. F. Powys]]).<ref>{{cite book | first1= Margarita| last1= Carretero Gonz\u00e1lez | first2= Encarnaci\u00f3n |last2= Hidalgo Tenorio | title= Behind the Veil of Familiarity: C.S. Lewis (1898\u20131998)| publisher= Peter Lang | year= 2001| isbn= 0-82045099-5 |page= 305}}</ref> More recent writers of fantasy novels with contemporary settings, notably [[Tim Powers]], cite Williams as a model and inspiration. [[W. H. Auden]], one of Williams's greatest admirers, reportedly re-read Williams's extraordinary and highly unconventional history of the church, ''The Descent of the Dove'' (1939), every year. Williams's study of Dante entitled ''The Figure of Beatrice'' (1944) was very highly regarded at its time of publication and continues to be consulted by [[Dante]] scholars today. His work inspired [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] to undertake her translation of ''The Divine Comedy''. Williams, however, regarded his most important work to be his extremely dense and complex [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] poetry, of which two books were published, ''Taliessin through Logres'' (1938) and ''The Region of the Summer Stars'' (1944), and more remained unfinished at his death. Some of Williams's essays were collected and published posthumously in ''Image of the City and Other Essays'' (1958), edited by [[Anne Ridler]].\n\nWilliams gathered many followers and disciples during his lifetime. He was, for a period, a member of the Salvator Mundi Temple of the [[Fellowship of the Rosy Cross]]. He met fellow Anglican [[Evelyn Underhill]] (who was affiliated with a similar group, the [[Order of the Golden Dawn]]) in 1937 and was later to write the introduction to her published ''Letters'' in 1943.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~dcandmkw/spirit/eucw%20-%20int.htm|title= Introduction to ''The Letters of Evelyn Underhill'' |last= Williams |first=Charles |year= 1943|website= iHug |publisher= Longmans, Green & Co |place= NZ |deadurl= yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421221635/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~dcandmkw/spirit/eucw%20-%20int.htm|archivedate= 21 April 2006}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, [[Oxford University Press]] moved its offices from London to [[Oxford]]. Williams was reluctant to leave his beloved city, and Florence refused to go. From the nearly 700 letters he wrote his wife during the war years a generous selection has been published; \"primarily\u2026 love letters,\" the editor calls them.<ref>{{cite book | editor-first= Roma A, Jr | editor-last= King| title= To Michal from Serge: Letters from Charles Williams to his wife, Florence, 1939\u20131945| place= Kent, Ohio; London| publisher= Kent State University Press | year= 2002| page= 4}}</ref> But the move to Oxford did allow him to participate regularly in Lewis\u2019s literary society known as the [[Inklings]]. In this setting Williams was able to read (and improve) his final published novel, ''All Hallows' Eve'', as well as to hear [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] read aloud to the group some of his early drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. In addition to meeting in Lewis's rooms at Oxford, they also regularly met at [[The Eagle and Child]] pub in Oxford (better known by its nickname \"The Bird and Baby\"). During this time Williams also gave lectures at Oxford on [[John Milton]], [[William Wordsworth]], and other authors, and received an honorary M.A. degree. Williams is buried in [[Holywell Cemetery]] in Oxford: his headstone bears the word \"poet\", followed by the words \"Under the Mercy\", a phrase often used by Williams himself.<ref>{{cite web |author= Arbor field|title=Under the Mercy | url= http://oxfordinklings.blogspot.com/2011/02/under-mercy.html|website= The Inklings |publisher= Google Blogger |date= 3 February 2011| accessdate= 25 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Grave of Charles Williams at Holywell.jpg|thumb|right|Williams' grave at [[Holywell Cemetery]] in Oxford]]\n\nIn 1917 Williams married his first sweetheart, Florence Conway, following a long courtship during which he presented her with a sonnet sequence that would later become his first published book of poetry, ''The Silver Stair''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theoddestinkling.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/the-silver-stair-1912/|title=''The Silver Stair'', 1912|last=Higgins|first=S\u00f8rina|date=13 November 2013|website=The Oddest Inkling|publisher=Wordpress|access-date=24 January 2017}}</ref><ref>''The Silver Stair''. London: Herbert & Daniel, 1912.</ref> Their son Michael was born in 1922.\n\nWilliams was an unswerving and devoted member of the [[Church of England]], reputedly with a tolerance of the scepticism of others and a firm belief in the necessity of a \"[[doubting Thomas]]\" in any apostolic body.<ref name= CWS>{{Cite web| url = http://www.charleswilliamssociety.org.uk/about/ | publisher= Oxford University Press; reproduced by permission online by The Charles Williams Society| title= About Charles Williams: Biography of Charles Walter Stansby Williams (1886-1945)| first= G. W. S. |last= Hopkins| work= Dictionary of National Biography, 1941-50}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Williams attracted the attention and admiration of some of the most notable writers of his day, including [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[W. H. Auden]], his greatest admirer was probably [[C. S. Lewis]], whose novel ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' (1945) has been regarded as partially inspired by his acquaintance with both the man and his novels and poems. Williams came to know Lewis after reading Lewis's then-recently published study ''[[The Allegory of Love]]''; he was so impressed he jotted down a letter of congratulation and dropped it in the mail. Coincidentally, Lewis had just finished reading Williams's novel ''[[The Place of the Lion]]'' and had written a similar note of congratulation. The letters crossed in the mail and led to an enduring and fruitful friendship.\n\n== Theology ==\nWilliams developed the concept of co-inherence and gave rare consideration to the theology of romantic love. Falling in love for Williams was a form of mystical envisioning in which one saw the beloved as he or she was seen through the eyes of God. Co-inherence was a term used in [[Patristic]] theology to describe the relationship between the human and divine natures of Jesus Christ and the relationship between the persons of the blessed Trinity.<ref>{{Cite book |title= The Figure of Beatrice: A Study in Dante|last=Williams |first= Charles |publisher=Noonday |year= 1961 |location=New York |page =92}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bztKAwAAQBAJ|title= God in Patristic Thought|last= Prestige |first=G.L.|publisher= Wipf & Stock|year=2008|isbn= 978-1-55635779-4 |chapter = XIV: Co-Inherence}}</ref> Williams extended the term to include the ideal relationship between the individual parts of God's creation, including human beings. It is our mutual indwelling: Christ in us and we in Christ, interdependent.  It is also the web of interrelationships, social and economic and ecological, by which the social fabric and the natural world function.<ref>{{cite journal | last= Marshall|first=Ashley |title= Reframing Charles Williams: Modernist Doubt and the Crisis of World War in ''All Hallows' Eve''|journal= Journal of Modern Literature|volume= 30 |issue= 2|date=2007 |page = 67 |jstor= 4619328}}</ref> But especially for Williams, co-inherence is a way of talking about the Body of Christ and the communion of saints. For Williams, salvation was not a solitary affair: \"The thread of the love of God was strong enough to save you and all the others, but not strong enough to save you alone.\"{{Citation needed |date=March 2016}} He proposed an order, the Companions of the Co-inherence, who would practice substitution and exchange, living in love-in-God, truly bearing one another's burdens, being willing to sacrifice and to forgive, living from and for one another in Christ.<ref>{{Cite journal |last= Newman|first=Barbara |date= 2009-01-01|title= Charles Williams and the Companions of the Co-inherence |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/spiritus/v009/9.1.newman.html|journal= Spiritus: A Journal of Christian Spirituality |volume= 9 |issue= 1 |pages=1\u201326|doi=10.1353/scs.0.0043 |issn= 1535-3117}}</ref> According to Gunnar Urang, co-inherence is the focus of all Williams's novels.<ref name= \"Urang1971\">{{cite book |first= Gunnar |last=Urang |title= Shadows of heaven: religion and fantasy in the writing of C.S.

Celery has a long fibrous stalk tapering into leaves. Depending on location and cultivar, either its stalks, leaves, or [[hypocotyl]] are eaten and used in cooking.  Celery seed is also used as a spice and its extracts have been used in [[herbal medicine]].\n\n==Description==\nCelery leaves are [[pinnation|pinnate]] to bipinnate with rhombic leaflets {{convert|3|\u2013|6|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|4|cm|abbr=on}} broad. The flowers are creamy-white, {{convert|2|\u2013|3|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter, and are produced in dense compound [[umbel]]s. The seeds are broad ovoid to globose, {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2|mm|abbr=on}} long and wide. Modern [[cultivar]]s have been selected for solid [[petiole (botany)|petioles]], leaf stalks.<ref name=Vilmorin/> A celery stalk readily separates into \"strings\" which are bundles of angular [[collenchyma]] cells exterior to the [[vascular bundle]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Teaching plant anatomy through creative laboratory exercises|last=Peterson|first=R.

By the 19th century, the season for celery had been extended, to last from the beginning of September to late in April.<ref>{{cite book | author = William Robinson and W. P.

They are ranged under two classes, white and red.\nThe stalks grow in tight, straight, parallel bunches, and are typically marketed fresh that way, without roots and just a little green leaf remaining.\n\nThe stalks are eaten raw, or as an ingredient in salads, or as a flavoring in soups, stews, and pot roasts.\n\n===Europe===\nIn Europe, another popular variety  is [[celeriac]] (also known as ''celery root''), ''Apium graveolens'' var. ''rapaceum'', grown because its [[hypocotyl]] forms a large bulb, white on the inside. The bulb can be kept for months in winter and mostly serves as a main ingredient in soup. It can also be ground up and used in salads.\nThe leaves are used as seasoning; the small, fibrous stalks find only marginal use.<ref name=\"molly\">{{cite web|first=Molly| last=Watson|url=http://localfoods.about.com/od/fall/tp/aboutceleryroot.htm|title=All About Celery Root (Celeriac)|publisher=localfoods.about.com|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"eatseasons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eattheseasons.com/Archive/celery_root.htm|year=2010|title=eat celery root|publisher=eattheseasons.com|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Schuchert\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.mpiz-koeln.mpg.de/pr/garten/schau/ApiumgraveolensLvarrapaceum/Celeriac.html |title=Celeriac (''Apium graveolens'' L. var.

In North America the crisp petiole (leaf stalk) is used. In Europe the hypocotyl is used as a root vegetable. The leaves are strongly flavored and are used less often, either as a flavoring in soups and stews or as a dried herb. Celery, onions, and bell peppers are the [[holy trinity (cuisine)|\"holy trinity\"]] of [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Louisiana Creole]] and [[Cajun cuisine]]. Celery, onions, and carrots make up the French [[mirepoix (cuisine)|mirepoix]], often used as a base for sauces and soups. Celery is a staple in many soups, such as chicken noodle soup.\n\n===Leaves===\nCelery leaves are frequently used in cooking to add a mild spicy flavor to foods, similar to, but milder than black pepper. Celery leaves are suitable dried as a sprinkled on seasoning for use with baked, fried or roasted fish, meats and as part of a blend of fresh seasonings suitable for use in soups and stews.\n\n===Seeds===\nIn temperate countries, celery is also grown for its seeds. Actually very small fruit, these \"seeds\" yield a valuable [[essential oil]] that is used in the perfume industry. The oil contains the [[chemical compound]] [[apiole]]. Celery seeds can be used as flavoring or spice, either as whole seeds or ground.\n\n===Celery salt===\nThe seeds can be ground and mixed with salt, to produce [[celery salt]]. Celery salt can be made from an extract of the roots or using dried leaves. Celery salt is used as a seasoning, in cocktails (notably to enhance the flavor of [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]] cocktails), on the [[Chicago-style hot dog]], and in [[Old Bay Seasoning]].\n\n===Herbalism===\n[[File:Celery seed.jpg|thumb|Celery seeds]]\n\nCelery seeds have been used widely in Eastern herbal traditions such as [[Ayurveda]].<ref name=UMM />  [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] wrote that celery seeds could relieve pain in around AD 30.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Celsus/home.html Celsus, ''de Medicina'', Thayer translation]</ref>  Though scientific evidence is lacking, it is still used as in ancient times for water retention, arthritis, and inflammation, and has seen more recent uses for reducing blood pressure and muscular spasms and as a mosquito repellent.<ref name=UMM>{{cite web|url=https://www.umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/herb/celery-seed|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine Guide > Herb > Celery seed|publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center|accessdate=2018-02-15|date=2015-06-22}}</ref>\n\n==Nutrition==\n{{nutritional value\n| name=Celery, raw (''Apium graveolens'')\n| kJ=67\n| carbs=2.97&nbsp;g (including fiber)\n| sugars=1.34&nbsp;g\n| sucrose=0.08&nbsp;g\n| glucose=0.40&nbsp;g\n| lactose=0.00&nbsp;g\n| maltose=0.00&nbsp;g\n| galactose=0.48&nbsp;g\n| starch = 0.00&nbsp;g\n| fiber=1.6&nbsp;g\n| fat=0.17&nbsp;g\n| satfat=0.042&nbsp;g\n| transfat=0.000&nbsp;g\n| monofat=0.032&nbsp;g\n| polyfat=0.079&nbsp;g\n| protein=0.69&nbsp;g\n| water=95.43&nbsp;g\n| cholesterol=0&nbsp;mg\n| alcohol=0.0&nbsp;g\n| caffeine=0&nbsp;mg\n| calcium_mg=40\n| iron_mg=0.20\n| magnesium_mg=11\n| phosphorus_mg=24\n| potassium_mg=260\n| sodium_mg=80\n| zinc_mg=0.13\n| copper_mg=0.035\n| manganese=_mf = 0.103\n| selenium_mg = 40\n| fluoride_mg = 400\n| thiamin_mg=0.021\n| riboflavin_mg=0.057\n| niacin_mg=0.320\n| pantothenic_mg=0.246\n| vitB6_mg=0.074\n| folate_ug=36\n| vitB12_ug=0.00\n| choline_mg=6.1\n| vitC_mg=3.1\n| vitA_ug=22\n| vitE_mg=0.27\n| vitD_iu= 0\n| vitK_ug=29.3\n| source_usda = 2914\n}}\n\nCelery is used in [[weight-loss]] diets, where it provides low-calorie [[dietary fibre]] bulk.

They built a small [[convent]] on the spot inhabited by the holy hermit, which became too small for the accommodation of those who came to share their life of privations.<ref name=Loughlin>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03479b.htm Loughlin, James. \"Pope St. Celestine V.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 20 November 2015</ref> Peter of Morone (later Pope Celestine V), their founder, built a number of other small [[Oratory (worship)|oratories]] in that neighborhood.\n\nAbout the year 1254, Peter of Morone gave the order a rule formulated in accordance with his own practices. In 1264 the new institution was approved as a branch of the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictines]] by [[Pope Urban IV|Urban IV]];<ref name=Loughlin/> however, the next pope [[Pope Gregory X]] had commanded that all orders founded since the prior [[Lateran Council]] should not be further multiplied. Hearing a rumor that the order was to be suppressed, the reclusive Peter traveled to [[Lyon]], where the Pope was holding a council. There he persuaded Gregory to approve his new order, making it a branch of the Benedictines and following the [[Rule of St Benedict|rule of Saint Benedict]], but adding to it additional severities and privations. Gregory took it under the Papal protection, assured to it the possession of all property it might acquire, and endowed it with exemption from the authority of the ordinary. Nothing more was needed to ensure the rapid spread of the new association and Peter the hermit of Morone lived to see himself \"Superior-General\" to thirty-six [[monastery|monasteries]] and more than six hundred [[monk]]s.  \n[[File:Couvent des C\u00e9lestins d'Avignon - cloitre.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Celestine cloister.  Avignon, France.]]\nAs soon as he had seen his new order thus consolidated he gave up the government of it to a certain Robert, and retired once again to an even more remote site to devote himself to solitary penance and prayer. Shortly afterwards, in a chapter of the order held in 1293, the original monastery of Majella being judged to be too desolate and exposed to too rigorous a climate, it was decided that the [[Abbey of the Holy Spirit at Monte Morrone, Sulmona|Abbey of the Holy Spirit at Monte Morrone]], located in Sulmona, should be the headquarters of the order and the residence of the General-Superior, where it continued for centuries. The next year Peter of Morrone, despite his reluctance, was elected Pope by the name of Celestine V. From there on, the order he had founded took the name of Celestines. During his short reign as Pope, the former hermit confirmed the rule of the order, which he had himself composed, and conferred on the society a variety of special graces and privileges. In the only creation of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s promoted by him, among the twelve raised to the purple, there were two monks of his order. He also visited personally the Benedictine monastery on [[Monte Cassino]], where he persuaded the monks to accept his more rigorous rule. He sent fifty monks of his order to introduce it, who remained there, however, for only a few months.\n\nAfter the death of the founder the order was favoured and privileged by [[Pope Benedict XI|Benedict XI]], and rapidly spread through [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Flanders]], and [[France]], where they were received by [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] in 1300. The administration of the order was carried on somewhat after the pattern of Cluny, that is all monasteries were subject to the Abbey of the Holy Ghost at Sulmona, and these dependent houses were divided into provinces. The Celestines had ninety-six houses in Italy, twenty-one in France, and a few in Germany.<ref name=Brookfield>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16019a.htm Brookfield, Paul. \"Celestine Order.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 16 (Index). New York: The Encyclopedia Press, 1914. 20 November 2015</ref>\n\nSubsequently the French Celestines, with the consent of the Italian superiors of the order, and of [[Pope Martin V]] in 1427, obtained the privilege of making new constitutions for themselves, which they did in the 17th century in a series of regulations accepted by the provincial chapter in 1667. At that time the French congregation of the order was composed of twenty-one monasteries, the head of which was that of [[Paris]], and was governed by a Provincial with the authority of General. [[Pope Paul V|Paul V]] was a notable benefactor of the order. The order became extinct in the eighteenth century.<ref name=Brookfield/>\n\n==Description of order==\nAccording to their special constitutions the Celestines were bound to say [[matins]] in the [[choir]] at two o'clock in the morning, and always to abstain from eating meat, save in illness. The distinct rules of their order with regard to [[fasting]] are numerous, but not more severe than those of similar congregations, though much more so than is required by the old Benedictine rule. In reading their minute directions for divers degrees of abstinence on various days, it is impossible to avoid being struck by the conviction that the great object of the framers of these rules was the general purpose of ensuring an [[asceticism|ascetic]] mode of life.\n\nThe Celestines wore a white [[wool]]len [[cassock]] bound with a [[linen]] band, and a [[leather]]n [[girdle]] of the same colour, with a [[scapular]] unattached to the body of the dress, and a black [[hood (headgear)|hood]]. It was not permitted to them to wear any shirt save of [[serge (fabric)|serge]]. Their dress in short was very like that of the [[Cistercians]]. But it is a tradition in the order that in the time of the founder they wore a coarse brown cloth. The church and monastery of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] originally belonged to the Celestines in [[Rome]]; but they were turned out of it by [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]] to make way for [[Franciscan]]s, receiving from the Pope in exchange the Church of [[St Eusebius of Vercelli]] with the adjacent mansion for a monastery.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Celestine order}}\n*{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Celestines |volume=5 |short=x}}\n\n\n[[Category:Celestine Order| ]]\n[[Category:1244 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:Catholic orders and societies]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations established in the 1240s]]\n[[Category:Christian religious orders established in the 13th century]]", "sha1": "m08u32rrve8gtjxhpcvn8ohlvd9n1f0"}}, {"title": "Cessna", "ns": "0", "id": "6539", "revision": {"id": "865095243", "parentid": "865085959", "timestamp": "2018-10-21T17:57:12Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ahunt", "id": "253891"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/216.49.254.121|216.49.254.121]] ([[User talk:216.49.254.121|talk]]) to last version by Kaiketsu", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|Aircraft manufacturing subsidiary of Textron}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{Infobox company\n|name=Cessna Aircraft Company\n|logo=[[File:Cessna Logo.svg|200px]]\n|type=Subsidiary\n|fate=\n|founded={{start date and age|1927}}\n|founder= [[Clyde Vernon Cessna|Clyde Cessna]]\n|defunct = March 2014 \n|successor = [[Textron Aviation]]\n|location=[[Wichita, Kansas]], United States\n|key_people=[[Scott A.

The marketing department chose \u201cLand-O-Matic\u201d to imply that these aircraft were much easier to land and take off than the preceding [[conventional landing gear]] equipped Cessna 170. They even went as far as to say pilots could do \u201cdrive-up take-offs and drive-in landings\u201d, implying that flying these aircraft was as easy as driving a car.

The term was intended to make the pilot feel visibility was improved on the notably poor-visibility Cessna line. The introduction of the rear window caused in most models a loss of cruise speed due to the extra drag, while not adding any useful visibility.<ref name=\"Clarke\" />\n*'''Cushioned power''' \u2013 The rubber mounts on the cowling of the 1967 model 150, in addition to the rubber mounts isolating the engine from the cabin.\n*'''Omni-Flash''' \u2013 The flashing beacon on the tip of the fin that could be seen all around.\n*'''Open-View''' \u2013 This referred to the removal of the top section of the control wheel in 1967 models. These had been rectangular, they now became \u201cram\u2019s horn\u201d shaped, thus not blocking the instrument panel as much.\n*'''Quick-Scan''' \u2013 Cessna introduced a new instrument panel layout in the 1960s and this buzzword was to indicate Cessna\u2019s panels were ahead of the competition.\n*'''Nav-O-Matic''' \u2013 The name of the Cessna autopilot system, which implied the system was relatively simple.\n*'''Camber-Lift''' \u2013 A marketing name used to describe Cessna aircraft wings starting in 1972 when the aerodynamics designers at Cessna added a slightly drooped [[leading edge]] to the standard [[NACA airfoil|NACA 2412]] [[airfoil]] used on most of the light aircraft fleet.

Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.</ref> A carnivore at the top of the [[food chain]], not preyed upon by other animals, is termed an [[apex predator]].\n\n\"Carnivore\" also may refer to the [[mammal]]ian order [[Carnivora]], but this is somewhat misleading: many, but not all, Carnivora are meat eaters, and even fewer are true obligate carnivores (see below). For example, while the Arctic [[polar bear]] eats meat exclusively, most species of [[bear]]s are actually [[omnivore|omnivorous]], and the [[giant panda]] is exclusively [[herbivore|herbivorous]]. There are also many carnivorous species that are not members of Carnivora.\n\nOutside the animal kingdom, there are several genera containing [[carnivorous plant]]s (predominantly insectivores) and several phyla containing [[carnivorous fungus|carnivorous fungi]] (preying mostly on microscopic [[invertebrate]]s such as [[nematode]]s, [[amoebae]] and [[springtail]]s).\n\n[[File:Venus_Flytrap_showing_trigger_hairs.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the vegetable kingdom can live on meat too, such as the [[Venus flytrap]], a [[carnivorous plant]]]] \n\nCarnivores are sometimes characterized by their [[List of feeding behaviours#By food type|type of prey]]. For example, animals that eat mainly [[insect]]s and similar invertebrates are called [[insectivore]]s, while those that eat mainly [[fish]] are called [[piscivore]]s. The first [[tetrapod]]s, or land-dwelling [[vertebrate]]s, were piscivorous amphibians known as [[Labyrinthodontia|labyrinthodonts]]. They gave rise to insectivorous vertebrates and, later, to predators of other tetrapods.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\">{{cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. & Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079\u20131082 | format=PDF | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12 }}</ref>\n\nCarnivores may alternatively be classified according to the percentage of meat in their diet. The diet of a [[hypercarnivore]] consists of more than 70% meat, that of a [[mesocarnivore]] 50\u201370%, and that of a [[hypocarnivore]] less than 30%, with the balance consisting of non-animal foods such as [[fruit]]s, other plant material, or [[fungi]].\n\n==Obligate carnivores==\n[[File:Tigre d'Asie \u00e0 robe blanche.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bengal tiger]]'s large [[canine tooth|canines]] and strong jaws reveal its place as an [[apex predator]]]]\n\nObligate or \"true\" carnivores are those whose diet requires nutrients found only in animal flesh. While obligate carnivores might be able to [[ingestion|ingest]] small amounts of plant matter, they lack the necessary [[physiology]] required to [[digestion|digest]] it. In fact, some obligate carnivorous mammals will ingest vegetation only as an [[emetic]], to self-induce vomiting of food that has upset its stomach.\n\nObligate carnivores include the [[axolotl]], which consumes mainly worms and larvae in its environment, but if necessary will consume algae, as well as all [[Felidae|felids]] (including the [[domestic cat]]) which require a diet of primarily animal flesh and organs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Velegrand-Defretin|first=Veronique|title=Differences between cats and dogs: a nutritional view|journal=Proceedings of the Nutrition Society|year=1994|volume=53|pages=15\u201324|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPNS%2FPNS53_01%2FS0029665194000066a.pdf&code=b428e668252a801500828a47df480146|doi=10.1079/pns19940004}}</ref> Specifically, cats have high protein requirements and their metabolisms appear unable to synthesize essential nutrients such as [[retinol]], [[arginine]], [[taurine]], and [[arachidonic acid]]; thus, in nature, they must consume flesh to supply these nutrients.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ullrey, D.

However, some carnivores do not hunt and are [[scavenger]]s, lacking the physical characteristics to bring down prey; in addition, most hunting carnivores will scavenge when the opportunity arises. Carnivores have comparatively short digestive systems, as they are not required to break down the tough cellulose found in plants.\n\nMany hunting animals have evolved eyes facing forward, enabling depth perception. This is almost universal among mammalian predators, while most reptile and amphibian predators have eyes facing sideways.\n\n==Prehistoric carnivores==\n{{main|Predation#Evolutionary history|Evolutionary history of life}}\n''[[Predation]]'' (the eating of one living creature by another for nutrition) predates the rise of commonly recognized carnivores by hundreds of millions (perhaps billions) of years. The earliest predators were microbial organisms, which engulfed or grazed on others. Because the fossil record is poor, these first predators could date back anywhere between 1 and over 2.7 Gya (billion years ago).<ref name=\"bengtson\">[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-paleontological-society-papers/article/origins-and-early-evolution-of-predation/54E8168EC25E08AFCAEF69C63A49C491 Origins and Early Evolution of Predation, 2002] ([http://www.nrm.se/download/18.4e32c81078a8d9249800021552/Bengtson2002predation.pdf full paper])</ref> The rise of [[eukaryotic]] cells at around 2.7 Gya, the rise of multicellular organisms at about 2 Gya, and the rise of mobile predators (around 600 Mya - 2 Gya, probably around 1 Gya) have all been attributed to early predatory behavior,<ref name=\"bengtson\"/> and many very early remains show evidence of boreholes or other markings attributed to small predator species.<ref name=\"bengtson\"/>\n\nAmong more familiar species, the first vertebrate carnivores were fish, and then amphibians that moved on to land. Early [[tetrapods]] were large amphibious [[piscivores]]. Some scientists assert that ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' \"was the first terrestrial vertebrate to develop the curved, serrated teeth that enable a predator to eat prey much larger than itself.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/5928/20140207/carnivorous-pre-dinosaur-predator-first-evolve-steak-knife-teeth.htm |author= Foley, James A. |date= February 7, 2014 |title= Carnivorous, Pre-Dinosaur Predator was First to Evolve Steak Knife-like Teeth |publisher= Nature World News |accessdate= May 3, 2014}}</ref> While amphibians continued to feed on fish and later insects, reptiles began exploring two new food types: tetrapods (carnivory) and then plants (herbivory). Carnivory was a natural transition from insectivory for medium and large tetrapods, requiring minimal adaptation; in contrast, a complex set of adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\" />\n\nIn the [[Mesozoic]], some [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' were probably obligate carnivores. Though the theropods were the larger carnivores, several carnivorous mammal groups were already present. Most notable are the [[Gobiconodontidae|gobiconodontids]], the [[Triconodontidae|triconodontid]] ''[[Jugulator (mammal)|Jugulator]]'', the [[Deltatheroida|deltatheroideans]] and ''[[Cimolestes]]''.

There are also attempts to reconstruct [[Cumbric]], a Brittonic language from [[North West England]] and [[South West Scotland]]. Celtic regions of [[Continental Europe]] are those whose residents claim a Celtic heritage, but where no Celtic language has survived; these areas include the western [[Iberian Peninsula]], i.e. [[Portugal]] and north-central [[Spain]] ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]], [[Extremadura]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Monaghan|first=Patricia|title=The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore|year=2008|publisher=Facts on File Inc.|isbn=978-0-8160-7556-0}}</ref>\n\n'''Continental Celts''' are the Celtic-speaking people of mainland Europe and '''Insular Celts''' are the Celtic-speaking peoples of the British and Irish islands and their descendants.

By the time speakers of Celtic languages entered history around [[400 BC]], they were already split into several language groups, and spread over much of Western continental Europe, the [[Iberian Peninsula]], Ireland and Britain.\nThe Greek historian [[Ephorus]] of Cyme in [[Asia Minor]], writing in the [[4th century BC]], believed that the Celts came from the islands off the mouth of the [[Rhine]] and were \"driven from their homes by the frequency of wars and the violent rising of the sea\".\n\n===Hallstatt culture===\nSome scholars think that the [[Urnfield culture]] of western [[Middle Europe]] represents an origin for the Celts as a distinct cultural branch of the Indo-European family.<ref name=ChadCorc/> This culture was preeminent in central Europe during the late [[Bronze Age]], from [[circa]] 1200 BC until 700 BC, itself following the [[Unetice culture|Unetice]] and [[Tumulus cultures]]. The Urnfield period saw a dramatic increase in population in the region, probably due to innovations in technology and agriculture. \n\nThe spread of [[Iron Age|iron-working]] led to the development of the [[Hallstatt culture]] directly from the Urnfield (c. 700 to 500 BC). Proto-Celtic, the latest [[common descent|common ancestor]] of all known Celtic languages, is considered by this school of thought to have been spoken at the time of the late Urnfield or early Hallstatt cultures, in the early 1st millennium BC. The spread of the Celtic languages to Iberia, Ireland and Britain would have occurred during the first half of the 1st millennium BC, the earliest [[chariot burial]]s in Britain dating to c. 500 BC. Other scholars see Celtic languages as covering Britain and Ireland, and parts of the Continent, long before any evidence of \"Celtic\" culture is found in archaeology. Over the centuries the language(s) developed into the separate [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]], Goidelic and Brittonic languages.\n\nThe Hallstatt culture was succeeded by the [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] of central Europe, which was overrun by the Roman Empire, though traces of La T\u00e8ne style are still to be seen in [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman artefacts]]. In Britain and Ireland La T\u00e8ne style in art survived precariously to re-emerge in [[Insular art]]. Early [[Irish literature]] casts light on the flavour and tradition of the heroic warrior elites who dominated Celtic societies. Celtic [[Old European hydronymy|river-names]] are found in great numbers around the upper reaches of the [[Danube]] and Rhine, which led many Celtic scholars to place the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Celts in this area.\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Strabo]] both suggest that the heartland of the people they called Celts was in [[southern France]]. The former says that the Gauls were to the north of the Celts, but that the Romans referred to both as Gauls (in linguistic terms the Gauls were certainly Celts). Before the discoveries at Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne, it was generally considered that the Celtic heartland was southern France, see [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] for 1813.\n\n===Atlantic seaboard theory===\n[[Myles Dillon]] and [[Nora Kershaw Chadwick]] accepted that \"the Celtic settlement of the British Isles\" might have to be dated to the [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker culture]] concluding that \"There is no reason why so early a date for the coming of the Celts should be impossible\".<ref>Myles Dillon and Nora Kershaw Chadwick, ''The Celtic Realms'', 1967, 18\u201319</ref><ref name=cunliffewest>{{cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=Celtic from the West Chapter 1: Celticization from the West \u2013 The Contribution of Archaeology|year=2010|publisher=Oxbow Books, Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-410-4|page=14}}</ref> [[Mart\u00edn Almagro Gorbea]]<ref>2001 p 95.

This view was challenged by the 19th-century historian [[Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville]] {{citation needed|date=November 2011}} who placed the land of origin of the Celts east of the Rhine. Jubainville based his arguments on a phrase of Herodotus' that placed the Celts at the source of the Danube, and argued that Herodotus had meant to place the Celtic homeland in southern Germany.\nThe finding of the prehistoric cemetery of Hallstat in 1846 by Johan Ramsauer and the finding of the archaeological site of La T\u00e8ne by Hansli Kopp in 1857 drew attention to this area.\n\nThe concept that the Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne cultures could be seen not just as chronological periods but as \"Culture Groups\", entities composed of people of the same ethnicity and language, had started to grow by the end of the 19th century.

It developed out of the Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under the impetus of considerable Mediterranean influence from [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], and later [[Etruscan civilisation]]s. A shift of settlement centres took place in the 4th century.\n\nThe western La T\u00e8ne culture corresponds to historical [[Gaul|Celtic Gaul]]. Whether this means that the whole of La T\u00e8ne culture can be attributed to a unified Celtic people is difficult to assess; archaeologists have repeatedly concluded that language, material culture, and [[Political party|political affiliation]] do not necessarily run parallel. Frey notes that in the 5th century, \"burial customs in the Celtic world were not uniform; rather, localised groups had their own beliefs, which, in consequence, also gave rise to distinct artistic expressions\".<ref>*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110517084539/http://www.ria.ie/publications/journals/journaldb/index.asp?select=fulltext&id=100427.

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century AD says that the Gauls \"originally called Celts\", \"live on the remotest region of Europe on the coast of an enormous tidal sea\". [[Posidonius]] described the southern Gauls about 100 BC. Though his original work is lost it was used by later writers such as [[Strabo]]. The latter, writing in the early 1st century AD, deals with Britain and Gaul as well as Hispania, Italy and Galatia. [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] wrote extensively about his [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Gallic Wars]] in 58\u201351 BC. [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote about the Celts of Gaul and Britain in his 1st-century history.\n\n==Distribution==\n===Continental Celts===\n====Gaul====\n{{Main article|Gauls}}\n\nThe Romans knew the Celts then living in what became present-day France as Gauls. The territory of these peoples probably included the [[Low Countries]], the Alps and present-day northern Italy. [[Julius Caesar]] in his ''[[Gallic Wars]]'' described the 1st-century BC descendants of those Gauls.\n\nEastern Gaul became the centre of the western La T\u00e8ne culture. In later Iron Age Gaul, the social organisation resembled that of the Romans, with large towns. From the 3rd century BC the Gauls adopted coinage. Texts with Greek characters from southern Gaul have survived from the 2nd century BC.\n\nGreek traders founded [[Marseille|Massalia]] about 600 BC, with some objects (mostly drinking ceramics) being traded up the [[Rh\u00f4ne River|Rhone valley]]. But trade became disrupted soon after 500 BC and re-oriented over the Alps to the Po valley in the Italian peninsula. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] arrived in the Rhone valley in the 2nd century BC and encountered a mostly Celtic-speaking Gaul. Rome wanted land communications with its Iberian provinces and fought a major battle with the [[Saluvii]] at [[Entremont (oppidum)|Entremont]] in 124\u2013123 BC. Gradually Roman control extended, and the [[Roman province|Roman Province]] of [[Gallia Narbonensis|Gallia Transalpina]] developed along the Mediterranean coast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dietler|first=Michael|title=Archaeologies of Colonialism: Consumption, Entanglement, and Violence in Ancient Mediterranean France|year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-26551-3}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dietler|first=Michael|title=Consumption and Colonial Encounters in the Rh\u00f4ne Basin of France: A Study of Early Iron Age Political Economy|year=2005|publisher=Monographies d'Arch\u00e9ologie Medit\u00e9rran\u00e9enne, 21, CNRS, France|isbn=978-2-912369-10-9}}\n</ref> The Romans knew the remainder of Gaul as Gallia Comata \u2013 \"Hairy Gaul\".\n\nIn 58 BC the [[Helvetii]] planned to migrate westward but Julius Caesar forced them back.

E. Europe, first century BC (in purple)]]\n{{Main article|Gallic invasion of the Balkans}}\n\nThe Celts also expanded down the [[Danube]] river and its tributaries. One of the most influential tribes, the [[Scordisci]], had established their capital at [[Singidunum]] in the 3rd century BC, which is present-day [[Belgrade]], Serbia. The concentration of hill-forts and cemeteries shows a [[Population density|density of population]] in the [[Tisza]] valley of modern-day [[Vojvodina]], Serbia, Hungary and into [[Ukraine]]. Expansion into [[Romania]] was however blocked by the [[Dacians]].\n\nFurther south, Celts settled in [[Thrace]] ([[Bulgaria]]), which they ruled for over a century, and [[Anatolia]], where they settled as the [[Galatia]]ns ''(see also: [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Gallic Invasion of Greece]])''. Despite their [[geographical isolation]] from the rest of the Celtic world, the Galatians maintained their Celtic language for at least 700 years. [[St Jerome]], who visited Ancyra (modern-day [[Ankara]]) in 373 AD, likened their language to that of the [[Treveri]] of northern Gaul.\n\nFor Venceslas Kruta, Galatia in central Turkey was an area of dense Celtic settlement.\n\nThe [[Boii]] tribe gave their name to [[Bohemia]], [[Bologna]] and possibly [[Bavaria]], and Celtic artefacts and cemeteries have been discovered further east in what is now Poland and [[Slovakia]]. A Celtic coin ([[Biatec]]) from [[Bratislava]]'s mint was displayed on the old Slovak 5-crown coin.\n\nAs there is no archaeological evidence for large-scale invasions in some of the other areas, one current school of thought holds that Celtic language and culture spread to those areas by contact rather than invasion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=The Celts: A Very Short Introduction|year=2003|publisher=Oxford|isbn=0-19-280418-9|page=71}}</ref> However, the Celtic invasions of Italy and the [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|expedition in Greece and western Anatolia]], are well documented in Greek and Latin history.\n\nThere are records of Celtic mercenaries in [[Egypt]] serving the [[Ptolemies]]. Thousands were employed in 283\u2013246 BC and they were also in service around 186 BC. They attempted to overthrow [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]].\n\n===Insular Celts===\n[[File:Romanbritain.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Principal sites in [[Roman Britain]], with indication of tribal territories]]\n{{main article|Insular Celts}}\n{{Further information|Iron Age Britain|Celtic immigration to the British Isles}}\n{{Further information|Iron Age tribes in Britain|Goidelic substrate hypothesis|O'Rahilly's historical model}}\n\nAll Celtic languages extant today belong to the [[Insular Celtic languages]], derived from the Celtic languages spoken in [[Iron Age Britain]] and [[Ireland]].<ref>Ball, Martin, Muller, Nicole (eds.) The Celtic Languages, Routledge, 2003, pp. 67ff.</ref> They were separated into a [[Goidelic]] and a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] branch from an early period.\n\nLinguists have been arguing for many years whether a Celtic language came to Britain and Ireland and then split or whether there were two separate \"invasions\". The older view of prehistorians was that the Celtic influence in the British Isles was the result of successive invasions from the European continent by diverse Celtic-speaking peoples over the course of several centuries, accounting for the [[P-Celtic]] vs. [[Celtic languages#Classification|Q-Celtic]] isogloss. This view has been challenged by the hypothesis that the Celtic languages of the British Isles form a phylogenetic [[Insular Celtic]] dialect group.<ref>Koch, J.T., (2006) Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, {{ISBN|1-85109-440-7}}, p. 973.</ref>\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars commonly dated the \"arrival\" of Celtic culture in Britain (via an invasion model) to the 6th century BC, corresponding to archaeological evidence of [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] influence and the appearance of [[chariot burial]]s in what is now England. Some Iron Age migration does seem to have occurred but the nature of the interactions with the indigenous populations of the isles is unknown. According to this model, by about the 6th century ([[Sub-Roman Britain]]), most of the inhabitants of the Isles were speaking Celtic languages of either the [[Goidelic]] or the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] branch. Since the late 20th century, a new model has emerged (championed by archaeologists such as [[Barry Cunliffe]] and Celtic historians such as [[John T. Koch]]) which places the emergence of Celtic culture in Britain much earlier, in the Bronze Age, and credits its spread not to invasion, but due to a gradual emergence ''[[in situ]]'' out of [[Proto-Indo-European]] culture (perhaps introduced to the region by the [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker People]], and enabled by an extensive network of contacts that existed between the peoples of Britain and Ireland and those of the Atlantic seaboard.<ref>Cunliffe, Barry, Koch, John T.

Roman local government of these regions closely mirrored pre-Roman tribal boundaries, and archaeological finds suggest native involvement in local government.\n\nThe native peoples under Roman rule became Romanised and keen to adopt Roman ways. Celtic art had already incorporated classical influences, and surviving Gallo-Roman pieces interpret classical subjects or keep faith with old traditions despite a Roman overlay.\n\nThe Roman occupation of [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], and to a lesser extent of [[Roman Britain|Britain]], led to Roman-Celtic [[syncretism]]. In the case of the continental Celts, this eventually resulted in a [[language shift]] to [[Vulgar Latin]], while the Insular Celts retained their language.\n\nThere was also considerable cultural influence exerted by Gaul on Rome, particularly in military matters and horsemanship, as the Gauls often served in the [[Roman cavalry]]. The Romans adopted the Celtic cavalry sword, the [[spatha]], and [[Epona]], the Celtic horse goddess.<ref name=Tristram>{{cite book|last=Tristram|first=Hildegard L.

Patron-client relationships similar to those of Roman society are also described by Caesar and others in the Gaul of the 1st century BC.\n\nIn the main, the evidence is of tribes being led by kings, although some argue that there is also evidence of [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] republican [[form of government|forms of government]] eventually emerging in areas which had close contact with Rome. Most descriptions of Celtic societies portray them as being divided into three groups: a warrior aristocracy; an intellectual class including professions such as [[druid]], poet, and jurist; and everyone else. In historical times, the offices of high and low kings in Ireland and Scotland were filled by election under the system of [[tanistry]], which eventually came into conflict with the feudal principle of [[primogeniture]] in which succession goes to the first-born son.\n\n[[File:Roman Bronze Statuette of a Captive Gaul, 2nd Century AD.jpg|thumb|Roman Bronze Statuette of a Captive Celtic, 2nd Century AD]]\n[[File:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Dying Gaul]]'', a Roman marble copy of a [[Hellenistic]] work of the late third century BC, [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome]]\n\nLittle is known of family structure among the Celts.

The monetary system was complex and is still not understood (much like the late Roman coinages), and due to the absence of large numbers of coin items, it is assumed that \"proto-money\" was used. This included bronze items made from the early La T\u00e8ne period and onwards, which were often in the shape of [[axe]]heads, rings, or [[bell (instrument)|bells]]. Due to the large number of these present in some burials, it is thought they had a relatively high [[Value (economics)|monetary value]], and could be used for \"day to day\" purchases. Low-value coinages of [[potin]], a bronze alloy with high tin content, were minted in most Celtic areas of the continent and in South-East Britain prior to the Roman conquest of these lands. Higher-value coinages, suitable for use in trade, were minted in gold, silver, and high-quality bronze. [[Gold coin]]age was much more common than [[silver coin]]age, despite being worth substantially more, as while there were around 100 mines in Southern Britain and Central France, silver was more rarely mined. This was due partly to the relative sparsity of mines and the amount of effort needed for extraction compared to the profit gained. As the Roman civilisation grew in importance and expanded its trade with the Celtic world, silver and bronze coinage became more common. This coincided with a major increase in gold production in Celtic areas to meet the Roman demand, due to the high value Romans put on the metal. The large number of gold mines in France is thought to be a major reason why Caesar invaded.\n\nThere are only very limited records from pre-Christian times written in Celtic languages. These are mostly inscriptions in the Roman and sometimes Greek alphabets. The [[Ogham]] script, an [[Early Medieval]] [[alphabet]], was mostly used in early Christian times in Ireland and Scotland (but also in Wales and England), and was only used for ceremonial purposes such as inscriptions on gravestones. The available evidence is of a strong oral tradition, such as that preserved by bards in Ireland, and eventually recorded by [[monastery|monasteries]]. Celtic art also produced a great deal of intricate and beautiful metalwork, examples of which have been preserved by their distinctive burial rites.\n\nIn some regards the Atlantic Celts were conservative: for example, they still used [[chariot]]s in combat long after they had been reduced to ceremonial roles by the Greeks and Romans. However, despite being outdated, Celtic [[chariot tactics]] were able to repel the invasion of Britain attempted by Julius Caesar.\n\nAccording to Diodorus Siculus:\n\n{{quote|The Gauls are tall of body with rippling muscles and white of skin and their hair is blond, and not only naturally so for they also make it their practice by artificial means to increase the distinguishing colour which nature has given it. For they are always washing their hair in limewater and they pull it back from the forehead to the nape of the neck, with the result that their appearance is like that of Satyrs and Pans since the treatment of their hair makes it so heavy and coarse that it differs in no respect from the mane of horses.

Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence. Energetic circular forms, [[triskele]]s and spirals are characteristic. Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from [[Pictish stones]] and the Insular [[high crosses]], large [[monumental sculpture]], even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly it was originally common in wood. Celts were also able to create developed musical instruments such as the carnyces, these famous war trumpets used before the battle to frighten the enemy, as the best preserved found in [[Tintignac]] ([[Gaul]]) in 2004 and which were decorated with a boar head or a snake head.<ref>http://tintignac.wix.com/tintignac-naves#!english/c11e3 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801011716/http://tintignac.wix.com/tintignac-naves |date=1 August 2015 }} Official website of Tintignac-Naves archeological site</ref>\n\nThe [[interlace (art)|interlace]] patterns that are often regarded as typical of \"Celtic art\" were characteristic of the whole of the British Isles, a style referred to as [[Insular art]], or Hiberno-Saxon art. This artistic style incorporated elements of La T\u00e8ne, Late Roman, and, most importantly, [[Germanic animal style|animal Style II]] of Germanic [[Migration Period art]]. The style was taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and [[illuminated manuscript]]s. Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: [[Gospel book]]s like the [[Book of Kells]] and [[Book of Lindisfarne]], chalices like the [[Ardagh Chalice]] and [[Derrynaflan Chalice]], and [[penannular brooch]]es like the [[Tara Brooch]]. These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the [[Viking]] attacks sharply set back cultural life.\n\nIn contrast the less well known but often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other \"foreign\" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic. After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially [[Ancient Roman pottery]], of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including [[figurine]]s of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalised styles. [[Roman Britain]] also took more interest in [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] than most of the Empire, and its development of [[champlev\u00e9]] technique was probably important to the later [[Medieval art]] of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom of Insular decoration was an important element. Rising nationalism brought [[Celtic Revival|Celtic revivals]] from the 19th century.\n\n==Warfare and weapons==\n{{Main article|Celtic warfare|Celtic sword}}\n[[File:Parade helmet.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremonial [[Agris Helmet]], 350 BC, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Angoul\u00eame|Angoul\u00eame city Museum]] in France, with stylistic borrowings from around the Mediterranean]]\n\n[[Prehistoric warfare|Tribal warfare]] appears to have been a regular feature of Celtic societies. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for [[Comparative advantage|economic advantage]], and in some instances to conquer territory.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nThe Celts were described by classical writers such as [[Strabo]], [[Livy]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], and [[Florus]] as fighting like \"wild beasts\", and as hordes. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] said that their {{blockquote|\"manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in [[military science]]. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of [[wild boar]]s, throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all\".<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus,  ''Roman Antiquities''\np259 Excerpts from Book XIV</ref>}} Such descriptions have been challenged by contemporary historians.<ref>{{cite book\n|author=Ellis, Peter Berresford\n|title= ''The Celts: A History''\n|pages= 60\u20133\n|publisher=Caroll & Graf\n|year= 1998\n|isbn= 0-7867-1211-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Polybius]] (2.33) indicates that the principal Celtic weapon was a [[Iron Age sword|long bladed sword]] which was used for hacking edgewise rather than stabbing. Celtic warriors are described by Polybius and Plutarch as frequently having to cease fighting in order to straighten their sword blades. This claim has been questioned by some archaeologists, who note that [[Noric steel]], steel produced in Celtic [[Noricum]], was famous in the [[Roman Empire]] period and was used to equip the [[Roman military]].<ref>\"Noricus ensis,\" [[Horace]], Odes, i. 16.9</ref><ref>Vagn Fabritius Buchwald, Iron and steel in [[Ancient history|ancient times]], 2005, p. 127</ref> However, Radomir Pleiner, in ''The Celtic Sword'' (1993) argues that \"the metallographic evidence shows that Polybius was right up to a point\", as around one third of surviving swords from the period might well have behaved as he describes.<ref>Radomir Pleiner, in ''The Celtic Sword'', Oxford: Clarendon Press (1993), p. 159.</ref>\n\nPolybius also asserts that certain of the Celts fought naked, \"The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life.\"<ref>Polybius, ''Histories'' II.28</ref> According to Livy, this was also true of the Celts of Asia Minor.<ref>Livy, ''History'' XXII.46 and XXXVIII.21</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n===Head hunting===\n[[File:nudeCeltwarrior.jpg|upright|thumb|A Gallic warrior statuette, first century BC, Museum of Brittany, [[Rennes]], [[France]]]]\n\nCelts had a reputation as [[Headhunting|head hunters]]. According to [[Paul Jacobsthal]], \"Amongst the Celts the [[human head]] was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world.\"<ref>Paul Jacobsthal ''Early Celtic Art''</ref> Arguments for a Celtic cult of the severed head include the many sculptured representations of severed heads in La T\u00e8ne carvings, and the surviving Celtic mythology, which is full of stories of the severed heads of heroes and the saints who [[cephalophore|carry their own severed heads]], right down to ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', where the [[Green Knight]] picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off, just as [[Denis|St. Denis]] carried his head to the top of [[Montmartre]].\n\nA further example of this regeneration after beheading lies in the tales of [[Connemara]]'s [[St. Feichin]], who after being beheaded by Viking pirates carried his head to the Holy Well on [[Omey Island]] and on dipping the head into the well placed it back upon his neck and was restored to full health.\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]], in his 1st-century ''History'' had this to say about Celtic head-hunting:\n{{quote|They cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle and attach them to the necks of their horses. The blood-stained spoils they hand over to their attendants and striking up a paean and singing a song of victory; and they nail up these first fruits upon their houses, just as do those who lay low wild animals in certain kinds of hunting. They embalm in [[cedar oil]] the heads of the most distinguished enemies, and preserve them carefully in a chest, and display them with pride to strangers, saying that for this head one of their ancestors, or his father, or the man himself, refused the offer of a large sum of money. They say that some of them boast that they refused the weight of the head in gold.}}\n\nIn ''[[Gods and Fighting Men]]'', [[Lady Gregory]]'s [[Celtic Revival]] translation of [[Irish mythology]], heads of men killed in battle are described in the beginning of the story ''The Fight with the Fir Bolgs'' as pleasing to [[Macha]], one aspect of the war goddess [[Morrigan|Morrigu]].\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:BrigitteCelt.jpg|thumb|left|A statuette probably depicting [[Brigantia (goddess)|Brigantia]] (or Brigid), with iconography derived from Roman statues of [[Minerva]], first century AD, Museum of [[Brittany]], [[Rennes]]]]\n\n===Polytheism===\n{{Main article|Celtic polytheism|Celtic animism}}\n\nLike other European Iron Age tribal societies, the Celts practised a [[Celtic polytheism|polytheistic religion]].<ref name=\"Cunliffe\"/>\nMany [[List of Celtic gods|Celtic gods]] are known from texts and inscriptions from the Roman period.\nRites and sacrifices were carried out by priests known as [[druid]]s. The Celts did not see their gods as having human shapes until late in the Iron Age. Celtic [[shrine]]s were situated in remote areas such as hilltops, groves, and lakes.\n\nCeltic religious patterns were regionally variable; however, some patterns of deity forms, and ways of worshipping these deities, appeared over a wide geographical and temporal range. The Celts worshipped both gods and goddesses. In general, Celtic gods were deities of particular skills, such as the many-skilled [[Lugh]] and [[The Dagda|Dagda]], while goddesses were associated with natural features, particularly rivers (such as [[Boann]], goddess of the [[River Boyne]]). This was not universal, however, as goddesses such as [[Brigid|Brighid]] and [[Morr\u00edgan|The Morr\u00edgan]] were associated with both natural features ([[clootie well|holy wells]] and the River Unius) and skills such as blacksmithing and healing.<ref name=\"Sjoestedt\">[[Marie-Louise Sjoestedt|Sjoestedt, Marie-Louise]] (originally published in French, 1940, reissued 1982) ''Gods and Heroes of the Celts''.

For instance, the Irish god Lugh, associated with storms, [[lightning]], and culture, is seen in similar forms as [[Lugos]] in Gaul and [[Lleu]] in Wales.

Monard speculated that it was recorded by [[druid]]s wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the [[Julian calendar]] was imposed throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. However, the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars (or ''[[Almanac#Hemerologies and parapegmata|parapegmata]]'') found throughout the Greek and Roman world.<ref>Lehoux, D.

Roman culture had a profound effect on the Celtic tribes which came under the empire's control. Roman influence led to many changes in Celtic religion, the most noticeable of which was the weakening of the druid class, especially religiously; the druids were to eventually disappear altogether. Romano-Celtic deities also began to appear: these deities often had both Roman and Celtic attributes, combined the names of Roman and Celtic deities, and/or included couples with one Roman and one Celtic deity. Other changes included the adaptation of the [[Jupiter Column]], a sacred column set up in many Celtic regions of the empire, primarily in northern and eastern Gaul. Another major change in religious practice was the use of stone monuments to represent gods and goddesses. The Celts had only created wooden idols (including monuments carved into trees, which were known as sacred poles) previously to Roman conquest.<ref name=\"Inse Jones 1995\"/>\n\n[[File:Ccross.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|A [[Celtic cross]]]]\n\n===Celtic Christianity===\n{{Main article|Celtic Christianity}}\n\nWhile the regions under Roman rule adopted Christianity along with the rest of the Roman empire, unconquered areas of Ireland and Scotland began to move from [[Celtic polytheism]] to Christianity in the 5th century. Ireland was converted by missionaries from Britain, such as [[Saint Patrick]]. Later missionaries from Ireland were a major source of [[missionary|missionary work]] in Scotland, Anglo-Saxon parts of Britain, and central Europe (see [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]). [[Celtic Christianity]], the forms of Christianity that took hold in Britain and Ireland at this time, had for some centuries only limited and intermittent contact with Rome and continental Christianity, as well as some contacts with [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christianity]]. Some elements of Celtic Christianity developed, or retained, features that made them distinct from the rest of Western Christianity, most famously their conservative method of calculating the [[Easter controversy|date of Easter]]. In 664, the [[Synod of Whitby]] began to resolve these differences, mostly by adopting the current Roman practices, which the [[Gregorian Mission]] from Rome had introduced to [[Anglo-Saxon England]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Celtic Studies}}\n* [[List of ancient Celtic peoples and tribes]]\n* [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Alberro, Manuel and Arnold, Bettina (eds.), ''[http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/ e-Keltoi: Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies], [http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/index.html Volume 6: The Celts in the Iberian Peninsula]'', [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee]], Center for Celtic Studies, 2005.\n* Collis, John.

His prosperous father could have purchased Monet's exemption from conscription but declined to do so when his son refused to give up painting. While in Algeria Monet did only a few sketches of [[casbah]] scenes, a single landscape, and several portraits of officers, all of which have been lost. In a ''Le Temps'' interview of 1900 however he commented that the light and vivid colours of North Africa \"contained the germ of my future researches\".<ref>Jeffrey Meyers, \"Monet in Algeria\", pp 19\u201324 \"History Today\" April 2015</ref> After about a year of garrison duty in Algiers, Monet contracted typhoid fever and briefly went absent without leave. Following convalescence, Monet's aunt intervened to remove him from the army if he agreed to complete a course at an art school. It is possible that the Dutch painter [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], whom Monet knew, may have prompted his aunt on this matter.\n\nDisillusioned with the traditional art taught at art schools, in 1862 Monet became a student of [[Charles Gleyre]] in Paris, where he met [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille]] and [[Alfred Sisley]]. Together they shared new approaches to art, painting the effects of light ''[[en plein air]]'' with broken colour and rapid brushstrokes, in what later came to be known as [[Impressionism]].\n\n[[File:Monet dejeunersurlherbe.jpg|thumb|''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe'' (right section), 1865\u20131866, with [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille]] and Camille Doncieux, first wife of the artist, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], [[Paris, France|Paris]]<ref>[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/index-of-works/notice.html?no_cache=1&nnumid=025651&cHash=22986e3842 Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, ''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe'', Notice de l'\u0153uvre, Iconographie]</ref>]]\n\nIn January 1865 Monet was working on a version of ''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe'', aiming to present it for hanging at the Salon, which had rejected Manet's ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' two years earlier.<ref name=Stuckey11>Charles F.

At their first exhibition, held in April 1874, Monet exhibited the work that was to give the group its lasting name.

From that time, with a short interruption for military service, he dedicated himself to searching for new and improved methods of painterly expression. To this end, as a young man, he visited the Paris Salon and familiarised himself with the works of older painters, and made friends with other young artists.<ref name=GJ/> The five years that he spent at [[Argenteuil]], spending much time on the River Seine in a little floating studio, were formative in his study of the effects of light and reflections. He began to think in terms of colours and shapes rather than scenes and objects. He used bright colours in dabs and dashes and squiggles of paint. Having rejected the academic teachings of Gleyre's studio, he freed himself from theory, saying \"I like to paint as a bird sings.\"<ref>Jennings, p. 130</ref>\n\nIn 1877 a series of paintings at St-Lazare Station had Monet looking at smoke and steam and the way that they affected colour and visibility, being sometimes opaque and sometimes translucent. He was to further use this study in the painting of the effects of mist and rain on the landscape.<ref>Jennings, p. 132</ref> The study of the effects of atmosphere was to evolve into a number of series of paintings in which Monet repeatedly painted the same subject in different lights, at different hours of the day, and through the changes of weather and season. This process began in the 1880s and continued until the end of his life in 1926.\n\nHis first series exhibited as such was of [[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]], painted from different points of view and at different times of the day. Fifteen of the paintings were exhibited at the [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Galerie Durand-Ruel]] in 1891. In 1892 he produced what is probably his best-known series, twenty-six views of ''[[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]]''.<ref name=\"HelenGardner\" /> In these paintings Monet broke with painterly traditions by cropping the subject so that only a portion of the fa\u00e7ade is seen on the canvas. The paintings do not focus on the grand Medieval building, but on the play of light and shade across its surface, transforming the solid masonry.<ref>Jennings p. 137</ref>\n\nOther series include ''[[Poplar Series (Monet)|Poplars]]'', ''Mornings on the Seine'', and the ''[[Water Lilies]]'' that were painted on his property at Giverny.

The [[Carthage National Museum]] was founded in 1875 by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Charles Lavigerie]].\nExcavations performed by French archaeologists in the 1920s attracted an extraordinary amount of attention because of the evidence they produced for [[Religion in Carthage#Child sacrifice|child sacrifice]], in Greco-Roman and Biblical tradition associated with the Canaanite god [[Baal Hammon]].

The city's location made it master of the Mediterranean's maritime trade. All ships crossing the sea had to pass between [[Sicily]] and the coast of Tunisia, where Carthage was built, affording it great power and influence. Two large, artificial harbors were built within the city, one for harboring the city's massive navy of 220 warships and the other for mercantile trade. A walled tower overlooked both harbors. The city had massive walls, {{convert|23|mi|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} in length, longer than the walls of comparable cities. Most of the walls were located on the shore, thus could be less impressive, as Carthaginian control of the sea made attack from that direction difficult. The {{convert|2.5|to|3|mi|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} of wall on the [[isthmus]] to the west were truly massive and were never penetrated. The city had a huge [[necropolis]] or burial ground, religious area, market places, council house, towers, and a theater, and was divided into four equally sized residential areas with the same layout. Roughly in the middle of the city stood a high citadel called the [[Byrsa]].\n\nCarthage was one of the largest cities of the [[Hellenistic period]] and was among the largest cities in preindustrial history. Whereas by AD 14, Rome had at least 750,000 inhabitants and in the following century may have reached 1 million, the cities of Alexandria and Antioch numbered only a few hundred thousand or less.<ref name=\"CharlesworthEdwards2000\">{{cite book|author1=Martin Percival Charlesworth|author2=Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards|author3=John Boardman|author4=Frank William Walbank|title=The Cambridge Ancient History: The fourth century B.C., 2nd ed., 1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WgHhAAAAMAAJ&dq=\"Rome+was+larger\"|year=2000|publisher=University Press|page=813}}</ref> According to the not always reliable history of [[Herodian]], Carthage rivaled Alexandria for second place in the Roman empire.<ref name=\"Grant2004\">{{cite book|author=Robert McQueen Grant|title=Augustus to Constantine: The Rise and Triumph of Christianity in the Roman World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_vxEB7nT_QC&pg=PP54|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22772-2|pages=54\u2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Maison punique byrsa.jpg|thumb|right|Punic ruins in Byrsa]]\nOn top of [[Byrsa]] hill, the location of the [[Forum (Roman)|Roman Forum]], a residential area from the last century of existence (early second century BCE.) of the Punic city was excavated by the French archaeologist Serge Lancel. The neighborhood, with its houses, shops, and private spaces, is significant for what it reveals about daily life there over 2100 years ago.<ref>Serge Lancel and Jean-Paul Morel, \"Byrsa. Punic vestiges\"; ''To save Carthage. Exploration and conservation of the city Punic, Roman and Byzantine'', Unesco / INAA, 1992, pp. 43\u201359</ref>\n\nThe remains have been preserved under embankments, the substructures of the later Roman forum, whose foundation piles dot the district. The housing blocks are separated by a grid of straight streets about {{convert|6|m|abbr=on|0}} wide, with a roadway consisting of clay; ''[[in situ]]'' stairs compensate for the slope of the hill. Construction of this type presupposes organization and political will, and has inspired the name of the neighborhood, \"[[Hannibal]] district\", referring to the legendary Punic general or [[shophet|sufet]] (consul) at the beginning of the second century BCE.\n\nThe habitat is typical, even stereotypical. The street was often used as a storefront/shopfront; cisterns were installed in basements to collect water for domestic use, and a long corridor on the right side of each residence led to a courtyard containing a [[sump]], around which various other elements may be found. In some places, the ground is covered with mosaics called punica pavement, sometimes using a characteristic red mortar.\n\nThe merchant harbor at Carthage was developed, after settlement of the nearby Punic town of [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]]. Eventually the surrounding countryside was brought into the orbit of the Punic urban centers, first commercially, then politically. Direct management over cultivation of neighbouring lands by Punic owners followed.<ref>St\u00e9phanie Gsell, ''Histoire ancienne de l'Afrique du Nord'', volume four (Paris 1920).</ref> A 28-volume work on agriculture written in Punic by [[Mago (agricultural writer)|Mago]], a retired army general (c. 300), was translated into Latin and later into Greek.

A History'' (Paris: Arth\u00e8me Fayard 1992; Oxford: Blackwell 1995) at 273\u2013274 (Mago quoted by Columella), 278\u2013279 (Mago and [[Cato the Elder|Cato]]'s book), 358 (translations).</ref> [[Olive trees]] (e.g., [[grafting]]), fruit trees ([[pomegranate]], [[almond]], [[ficus|fig]], [[date palm]]), [[viniculture]], [[bee]]s, [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[poultry]], implements, and [[farm management]] were among the ancient topics which Mago discussed. As well, Mago addresses the wine-maker's art (here a type of [[sherry]]).<ref>[[Gilbert Charles-Picard|Gilbert]] and [[Colette Picard]], ''La vie quotidienne \u00e0 Carthage au temps d'Hannibal'' (Paris: Librairie Hachette 1958), translated as ''Daily Life in Carthage'' (London: George Allen & Unwin 1961; reprint Macmillan, New York 1968) at 83\u201393: 88 (Mago as retired general), 89\u201391 (fruit trees), 90 (grafting), 89\u201390 (vineyards), 91\u201393 (livestock and bees), 148\u2013149 (wine making).

Lancel says (at 274) that about wine making, Mago was silent. Punic agriculture and rural life are addressed at 269\u2013302.</ref>\n\nIn Punic farming society, according to Mago, the small estate owners were the chief producers. They were, two modern historians write, not absent landlords. Rather, the likely reader of Mago was \"the master of a relatively modest estate, from which, by great personal exertion, he extracted the maximum yield.\" Mago counselled the rural landowner, for the sake of their own 'utilitarian' interests, to treat carefully and well their managers and farm workers, or their overseers and slaves.<ref>G. and C. Charles-Picard, ''La vie quotidienne \u00e0 Carthage au temps d'Hannibal'' (Paris: Librairie Hachette 1958) translated as ''Daily Life in Carthage'' (London: George Allen and Unwin 1961; reprint Macmillan 1968) at 83\u201393: 86 (quote); 86\u201387, 88, 93 (management); 88 (overseers).</ref> Yet elsewhere these writers suggest that rural land ownership provided also a new power base among the city's nobility, for those resident in their country villas.<ref>G. C. and C.

Another modern historian opines that more often it was the urban merchant of Carthage who owned rural farming land to some profit, and also to retire there during the heat of summer.<ref>B. H. Warmington, in his ''Carthage'' (London: Robert Hale 1960; reprint Penguin 1964) at 155.</ref> It may seem that Mago anticipated such an opinion, and instead issued this contrary advice (as quoted by the Roman writer Columella):\n\n<blockquote>\"The man who acquires an estate must sell his house, lest he prefer to live in the town rather than in the country. Anyone who prefers to live in a town has no need of an estate in the country.\"<ref>[[Mago (agricultural writer)|Mago]], quoted by [[Columella]] at I, i, 18; in Charles-Picard, ''Daily Life in Carthage'' (1958; 1968) at 87, 101, n37.</ref> \"One who has bought land should sell his town house, so that he will have no desire to worship the household gods of the city rather than those of the country; the man who takes greater delight in his city residence will have no need of a country estate.\"<ref>Mago, quoted by Columella at I, i, 18; in Moscati, ''The World of the Phoenicians'' (1966; 1973) at 220, 230, n5.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe issues involved in rural land management also reveal underlying features of Punic society, its structure and [[Social stratification|stratification]]. The hired workers might be considered 'rural proletariat', drawn from the local Berbers. Whether or not there remained Berber landowners next to Punic-run farms is unclear. Some Berbers became sharecroppers. Slaves acquired for farm work were often prisoners of war. In lands outside Punic political control, independent Berbers cultivated grain and raised horses on their lands. Yet within the Punic domain that surrounded the city-state of Carthage, there were ethnic divisions in addition to the usual quasi [[feudal]] distinctions between lord and peasant, or master and serf. This inherent instability in the countryside drew the unwanted attention of potential invaders.<ref>Gilbert and Colette Charles-Picard, ''Daily Life in Carthage'' (1958; 1968) at 83\u201385 (invaders), 86\u201388 (rural proletariat).</ref> Yet for long periods Carthage was able to manage these social difficulties.<ref>E.g., Gilbert Charles Picard and Colette Picard, ''The Life and Death of Carthage'' (Paris 1970; New York 1968) at 168\u2013171, 172\u2013173 (invasion of Agathocles in 310 BC). The ''mercenary revolt'' (240\u2013237) following the First Punic War was also largely and actively, though unsuccessfully, supported by rural Berbers. Picard (1970; 1968) at 203\u2013209.</ref>\n\nThe many [[amphora]]e with Punic markings subsequently found about ancient Mediterranean coastal settlements testify to Carthaginian trade in locally made [[olive oil]] and [[wine]].<ref>[[Plato]] (c. 427 \u2013 c. 347) in his ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' at 674, a-b, mentions regulations at Carthage restricting the consumption of wine in specified circumstances. Cf., Lancel, ''Carthage'' (1997) at 276.</ref> Carthage's agricultural production was held in high regard by the ancients, and rivaled that of Rome\u2014they were once competitors, e.g., over their olive harvests. Under Roman rule, however, [[grain]] production ([wheat] and [[barley]]) for export increased dramatically in 'Africa'; yet these later fell with the rise in [[History of Roman Egypt|Roman Egypt]]'s grain exports. Thereafter olive groves and vineyards were re-established around Carthage. Visitors to the several growing regions that surrounded the city wrote admiringly of the lush green gardens, orchards, fields, [[irrigation]] channels, hedgerows (as boundaries), as well as the many prosperous farming towns located across the rural landscape.<ref>Warmington, ''Carthage'' (London: Robert Hale 1960, 2d ed. 1969) at 136\u2013137.</ref><ref>Serge Lancel, ''Carthage'' (Paris: Arth\u00e8me Fayard 1992) translated by Antonia Nevill (Oxford: Blackwell 1997) at 269\u2013279: 274\u2013277 (produce), 275\u2013276 (amphora), 269\u2013270 & 405 (Rome), 269\u2013270 (yields), 270 & 277 (lands), 271\u2013272 (towns).</ref>\n\nAccordingly, the Greek author and compiler [[Diodorus Siculus]] (fl. 1st century BCE), who enjoyed access to ancient writings later lost, and on which he based most of his writings, described agricultural land near the city of Carthage circa 310 BC:\n \n<blockquote>\"It was divided into market gardens and orchards of all sorts of fruit trees, with many streams of water flowing in channels irrigating every part. There were country homes everywhere, lavishly built and covered with stucco. ... Part of the land was planted with vines, part with olives and other productive trees. Beyond these, cattle and sheep were pastured on the plains, and there were meadows with grazing horses.\"<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Bibleoteca'', at XX, 8, 1\u20134, transl. as ''Library of History'' (Harvard University 1962), vol.10 [Loeb Classics, no.390); per Soren, Khader, Slim,, ''Carthage'' (1990) at 88.</ref><ref>Lancel, ''Carthage'' (Paris 1992; Oxford 1997) at 277.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ''Chora'' (farm lands of Carthage) encompassed a limited area: the north coastal ''tell'', the lower [[Medjerda River|Bagradas river valley]] (inland from Utica), [[Cape Bon]], and the adjacent ''sahel'' on the east coast. Punic culture here achieved the introduction of agricultural sciences first developed for lands of the eastern Mediterranean, and their adaptation to local African conditions.<ref>Charles-Picard, ''Daily Life in Carthage'' (1958; 1968) at 85 (limited area), at 88 (imported skills).</ref>\n\nThe ''urban landscape'' of Carthage is known in part from ancient authors,<ref>e.g., the Greek writers: [[Appian]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Polybius]]; and, the Latin: [[Livy]], [[Strabo]].</ref> augmented by modern digs and surveys conducted by archeologists. The \"first urban nucleus\" dating to the seventh century, in area about {{convert|10|ha|acres}}, was apparently located on low-lying lands along the coast (north of the later harbors). As confirmed by archaeological excavations, Carthage was a \"creation ''ex nihilo''\", built on 'virgin' land, and situated at the end of a peninsula (per the ancient coastline). Here among \"mud brick walls and beaten clay floors\" (recently uncovered) were also found extensive cemeteries, which yielded evocative grave goods like clay masks. \"Thanks to this burial archaeology we know more about archaic Carthage than about any other contemporary city in the western Mediterranean.\" Already in the eighth century, fabric [[dyeing]] operations had been established, evident from crushed shells of [[murex]] (from which the 'Phoenician purple' was derived). Nonetheless, only a \"meager picture\" of the cultural life of the earliest pioneers in the city can be conjectured, and not much about housing, monuments or defenses.<ref>Serge Lancel, ''Carthage'' (Paris 1992), as translated by A.

It had the advantageous position of being situated on the outlet of the [[Medjerda River]], Tunisia's only river that flowed all year long. However, grain cultivation in the Tunisian mountains caused large amounts of [[silt]] to erode into the river. This silt accumulated in the harbor until it became useless, and Rome was forced to rebuild Carthage.\n\nBy 122 BC, [[Gaius Gracchus]] founded a short-lived [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], called ''[[Colonia Junonia|Colonia Iunonia]]'', after the Latin name for the Punic goddess [[Tanit]], ''Iuno Caelestis''. The purpose was to obtain arable lands for impoverished farmers. The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] abolished the colony some time later, to undermine Gracchus' power.\n\nAfter this ill-fated attempt, a new city of Carthage was built on the same land by [[Julius Caesar]] in the period from 49 to 44 BC, and by the first century, it had grown to be the second-largest city in the western half of the [[Roman Empire]], with a peak population of 500,000.<ref>[http://weburbanist.com/2010/09/26/bridges-that-babble-on-15-amazing-roman-aqueducts ''Bridges That Babble On: 15 Amazing Roman Aqueducts'', Article by Steve, filed under Abandoned Places in the Architecture category]</ref> It was the center of the [[Africa (Roman province)|province of Africa]], which was a major breadbasket of the Empire.

In the first of a string of rather poorly reported councils at Carthage a few years later, no fewer than 70 bishops attended. [[Tertullian]] later broke with the mainstream that was increasingly represented in the West by the [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome]], but a more serious rift among Christians was the [[Donatism|Donatist controversy]], which [[Augustine of Hippo]] spent much time and parchment arguing against. At the [[Council of Carthage (397)]], the [[development of the Christian biblical canon|biblical canon for the western Church was confirmed]].\n\n[[File:NE 500ad.jpg|thumb|The [[Vandal Kingdom]] in 500, centered on Carthage]]\nThe political fallout from the deep disaffection of [[Christianity in Africa|African Christians]] is supposedly a crucial factor in the ease with which Carthage and the other centers were captured in the fifth century by [[Genseric]], king of the [[Vandals]], who defeated the Roman general [[Bonifacius]] and made the city the capital of the [[Vandal Kingdom]]. Genseric was considered a heretic, too, an [[Arianism|Arian]], and though Arians commonly despised [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christians, a mere promise of toleration might have caused the city's population to accept him.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to recapture the city in the fifth century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] finally subdued the Vandals in the [[Vandalic War]] in 533\u2013534. Thereafter, the city became the seat of the [[praetorian prefecture of Africa]], which was made into an [[exarchate]] during the emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice's]] reign, as was [[Ravenna]] on the Italian Peninsula. These two exarchates were the western bulwarks of the Byzantine Empire, all that remained of its power in the West. In the early seventh century [[Heraclius the Elder]], the exarch of Carthage, overthrew the Byzantine emperor [[Phocas]], whereupon his son [[Heraclius]] succeeded to the imperial throne.\n\n===Islamic period===\n{{main article|Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Battle of Carthage (698)}}\n\nThe Roman [[Exarchate of Africa]] was not able to withstand the seventh-century [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]].

In 695, [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] captured Carthage and advanced into the [[Atlas Mountains]]. An imperial fleet arrived and retook Carthage, but in 698, [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] returned and defeated Emperor [[Tiberios III]] at the [[Battle of Carthage (698)|698 Battle of Carthage]].

Under the [[Aghlabid]]s, the people of Tunis revolted numerous times, but the city profited from economic improvements and quickly became the second most important in the kingdom. It was briefly the national capital, from the end of the reign of [[Ibrahim II of Ifriqiya|Ibrahim II]] in 902, until 909, when the [[Shi'ite]] [[Berber people|Berbers]] took over [[Ifriqiya]] and founded the [[Fatimid Caliphate]].\n\n[[Carthage (episcopal see)|Carthage]] remained a residential see until the [[high medieval period]], mentioned in\ntwo letters of [[Pope Leo IX]] dated 1053,<ref>''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=r8EUAAAAQAAJ&redir_esc=y vol. 143, coll. 727\u2013731]</ref> written in reply to consultations regarding a conflict between the bishops of Carthage and [[Africa (Roman province)#Episcopal sees|Gummi]].\nIn each of the two letters, Pope Leo declares that, after the Bishop of Rome, the first archbishop and chief metropolitan of the whole of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] is the bishop of Carthage. \nLater, an archbishop of Carthage named Cyriacus was imprisoned by the Arab rulers because of an accusation by some Christians.

Business activity was accordingly both stimulated and challenged. [[Cyprus]] had been an early site of such commercial contests. The Phoenicians then had ventured into the western Mediterranean, founding trading posts, including Utica and Carthage. The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] followed, entering the western seas where the commercial rivalry continued. Eventually it would lead, especially in [[Sicily]], to several centuries of intermittent war.<ref>Cf., Charles-Picard, ''Daily Life in Carthage'' (Paris 195; Oxford 1961, reprint Macmillan 1968) at 165, 171\u2013177.</ref><ref>Donald Harden, ''The Phoenicians'' (New York: Praeger 1962, 2d ed. 1963) at 57\u201362 (Cyprus and Aegean), 62\u201365 (western Mediterranean); 157\u2013170 (trade); 67\u201370, 84\u201385, 160\u2013164 (the Greeks).</ref> Although Greek-made merchandise was generally considered superior in design, Carthage also produced trade goods in abundance. That Carthage came to function as a manufacturing colossus was shown during the [[Third Punic War]] with Rome. Carthage, which had previously disarmed, then was made to face the fatal Roman siege. The city \"suddenly organised the manufacture of arms\" with great skill and effectiveness. According to [[Strabo]] (63 BC \u2013 AD 21) in his ''[[Geographica]]'':\n\n<blockquote>\"[Carthage] each day produced one hundred and forty finished shields, three hundred swords, five hundred spears, and one thousand missiles for the catapults... . Furthermore, [Carthage although surrounded by the Romans] built one hundred and twenty decked ships in two months... for old timber had been stored away in readiness, and a large number of skilled workmen, maintained at public expense.\"<ref>[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'', XVII,3,15; as translated by H. L. Jones (Loeb Classic Library 1932) at VIII: 385.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe textiles industry in Carthage probably started in private homes, but the existence of professional weavers indicates that a sort of factory system later developed. Products included embroidery, carpets, and use of the purple murex dye (for which the Carthaginian isle of [[Djerba]] was famous). [[Metalwork]]ers developed specialized skills, i.e., making various weapons for the armed forces, as well as domestic articles, such as knives, forks, scissors, mirrors, and razors (all articles found in tombs). Artwork in metals included vases and lamps in bronze, also bowls, and plates. Other products came from such crafts as the [[pottery|potters]], the [[glassmaking|glassmakers]], and the [[goldsmith]]s. Inscriptions on votive stele indicate that many were not slaves but 'free citizens'.<ref>Sabatino Moscati, ''The World of the Phoenicians'' (1966; 1973) at 223\u2013224.</ref>\n \n[[File:PhoenicianTrade.png|right|thumb|Trade routes of Phoenicia (Byblos, Sidon, Tyre) & Carthage]]\n\nPhoenician and Punic merchant ventures were often run as a family enterprise, putting to work its members and its subordinate clients. Such family-run businesses might perform a variety of tasks: (a) own and maintain the [[trireme|ships]], providing the captain and crew; (b) do the negotiations overseas, either by [[barter]] or buy and sell, of (i) their own manufactured commodities and trade goods, and (ii) native products (metals, foodstuffs, etc.) to carry and trade elsewhere; and (c) send their [[agent (law)|agents]] to stay at distant outposts in order to make lasting local contacts, and later to establish a warehouse of shipped goods for exchange, and eventually perhaps a settlement. Over generations, such activity might result in the creation of a wide-ranging network of trading operations. Ancillary would be the growth of [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] between different family firms, foreign and domestic.<ref>Richard J.

Carthaginian generals marshalled mercenary armies and were separately elected. From about 550 to 450 the Magonid family monopolized the top military position; later the Barcid family acted similarly. Eventually it came to be that, after a war, the commanding general had to testify justifying his actions before a court of 104 judges.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warmington|first=B.

McKeon, translated by B. Jowett (Random House 1941), ''Politica'' at pages 1113\u20131316, \"Carthage\" at 1171\u20131174.</ref>  Later [[Polybius|Polybius of Megalopolis]] (c.204\u2013122, Greek) in his ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' would describe the [[Roman Republic]] in more detail as a mixed constitution in which the [[Roman consul|Consuls]] were the monarchy, the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] the aristocracy, and the [[Roman assemblies|Assemblies]] the democracy.<ref>Polybius, ''Histories'' VI, 11\u201318, translated as ''The Rise of the Roman Empire'' (Penguin 1979) at 311\u2013318.</ref>\n\nEvidently Carthage also had an institution of [[Elder (administrative title)|elders]] who advised the Suffets, similar to a Greek ''gerusia'' or the [[Roman Senate]].  We do not have a Punic name for this body. At times its members would travel with an army general on campaign.  Members also formed permanent [[committees]].  The institution had several hundred members drawn from the wealthiest class who held office for life.  Vacancies were probably filled by recruitment from among the elite, i.e., by [[co-option]]. From among its members were selected the [[Hundred and Four|104 Judges]] mentioned above. Later the 104 would come to evaluate not only army generals but other office holders as well. Aristotle regarded the 104 as most important; he compared it to the [[ephor]]ate of [[Sparta]] with regard to control over security. In Hannibal's time, such a Judge held office for life.  At some stage there also came to be independent self-perpetuating boards of five who filled vacancies and supervised (non-military) government administration.<ref>Warmington, ''Carthage'' (1960; Penguin 1964) at 147\u2013148.</ref>\n\nPopular [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]] also existed at Carthage. When deadlocked the Suffets and the quasi-senatorial institution of elders might request the assembly to vote; also, assembly votes were requested in very crucial matters in order to achieve political consensus and popular coherence. The assembly members had no ''legal'' wealth or birth qualification.  How its members were selected is unknown, e.g., whether by festival group or urban ward or another method.<ref>Warmington, ''Carthage'' (1960; Penguin 1964) at 148.</ref><ref>Aristotle presents a slightly more expansive interpretation of the role of assemblies. ''Politica'' II, 11, (1273a/6\u201311); McKeon, ed., ''Basic Works of Aristotle'' (1941) at 1172.</ref><ref>Compare [[Roman assemblies]].</ref>\n\nThe Greeks were favourably impressed by the constitution of Carthage; [[Aristotle]] had a separate study of it made which unfortunately is lost. In his ''Politica'' he states: \"The government of Carthage is oligarchical, but they successfully escape the evils of oligarchy by enriching one portion of the people after another by sending them to their colonies.\" \"[T]heir policy is to send some [poorer citizens] to their dependent towns, where they grow rich.\"<ref>Aristotle, ''Politica'' at II, 11, (1273b/17\u201320), and at VI, 5, (1320b/4\u20136) re colonies; in McKeon, ed., ''Basic Works of Aristotle'' (1941) at 1173, and at 1272.</ref><ref>\"Aristotle said that the oligarchy was careful to treat the masses liberally and allow them a share in the profitable exploitation of the subject territories.\" Warmington, ''Carthage'' (1960, 1964) at 149, citing Aristotle's ''Politica'' as here.</ref> Yet Aristotle continues, \"[I]f any misfortune occurred, and the bulk of the subjects revolted, there would be no way of restoring peace by legal means.\" Aristotle remarked also:\n\n<blockquote>\"Many of the Carthaginian institutions are excellent. The superiority of their constitution is proved by the fact that the common people remain loyal to the constitution; the Carthaginians have never had any rebellion worth speaking of, and have never been under the rule of a [[tyrant]].\"<ref>Aristotle, ''Politica'' at II, 11, (1273b/23\u201324) re misfortune and revolt, (1272b/29\u201332) re constitution and loyalty; in McKeon, ed., ''Basic Works of Aristotle'' (1941) at 1173, 1171.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHere one may remember that the city-state of Carthage, who citizens were mainly ''Libyphoenicians'' (of Phoenician ancestry born in Africa), dominated and exploited an agricultural countryside composed mainly of native Berber sharecroppers and farmworkers, whose affiliations to Carthage were open to divergent possibilities. Beyond these more settled Berbers and the Punic farming towns and rural manors, lived the independent Berber tribes, who were mostly pastoralists.\n\nIn the brief, uneven review of government at Carthage found in his ''Politica'' Aristotle mentions several faults. Thus, \"that the same person should hold many [[office]]s, which is a favorite practice among the Carthaginians.\" Aristotle disapproves, mentioning the flute-player and the shoemaker. Also, that \"magistrates should be chosen not only for their merit but for their wealth.\" Aristotle's opinion is that focus on pursuit of wealth will lead to [[oligarchy]] and its evils.\n\n<blockquote>\"[S]urely it is a bad thing that the greatest offices... should be bought. The law which allows this abuse makes wealth of more account than virtue, and the whole state becomes avaricious. For, whenever the chiefs of the state deem anything honorable, the other citizens are sure to follow their example; and, where virtue has not the first place, their aristocracy cannot be firmly established.\"<ref>Aristotle, ''Politica'' at II, 11, (1273b/8\u201316) re one person many offices, and (1273a/22\u20131273b/7) re oligarchy; in McKeon, ed., ''Basic Works of Aristotle'' (1941) at 1173, 1172\u20131273.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn Carthage the people seemed politically satisfied and submissive, according to the historian Warmington. They in their assemblies only rarely exercised the few opportunities given them to assent to state decisions. Popular influence over government appears not to have been an issue at Carthage. Being a commercial republic fielding a [[mercenary]] army, the people were not conscripted for military service, an experience which can foster the feel for popular political action. But perhaps this misunderstands the society; perhaps the people, whose values were based on small-group loyalty, felt themselves sufficiently connected to their city's leadership by the very integrity of the person-to-person linkage within their social fabric. Carthage was very stable; there were few openings for [[tyrants]]. Only after defeat by Rome devastated Punic imperial ambitions did the people of Carthage seem to question their governance and to show interest in political reform.<ref>Warmington, ''Carthage'' (1960, 1964) at 143\u2013144, 148\u2013150. \"The fact is that compared to Greeks and Romans the Carthaginians were essentially non-political.\" ''Ibid.'' at 149.</ref>\n\nIn 196, following the [[Second Punic War]] (218\u2013201), [[Hannibal Barca]], still greatly admired as a Barcid military leader, was elected [[suffet]]. When his reforms were blocked by a financial official about to become a judge for life, Hannibal rallied the populace against the 104 judges. He proposed a one-year term for the 104, as part of a major civic overhaul. Additionally, the reform included a restructuring of the city's revenues, and the fostering of trade and agriculture. The changes rather quickly resulted in a noticeable increase in prosperity. Yet his incorrigible political opponents cravenly went to Rome, to charge Hannibal with conspiracy, namely, plotting war against Rome in league with [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus]] the Hellenic ruler of [[Seleucid Empire|Syria]]. Although the Roman [[Scipio Africanus]] resisted such manoeuvre, eventually intervention by Rome forced Hannibal to leave Carthage. Thus, corrupt city officials efficiently blocked Hannibal Barca in his efforts to reform the government of Carthage.<ref>H. H. Scullard, ''A History of the Roman World, 753\u2013146 BC'' (London: Methuen 1935, 4th ed. 1980; reprint Routledge 1991) at 306\u2013307.</ref><ref>Warmington, ''Carthage'' at 240\u2013241, citing the Roman historian [[Livy]].</ref>\n\nMago (6th century) was King of Carthage; the [[head of state]], war leader, and religious figurehead.  His family was considered to possess a sacred quality.  Mago's office was somewhat similar to that of a [[pharaoh]], but although kept in a family it was not hereditary, it was limited by legal consent. Picard, accordingly, believes that the council of elders and the popular assembly are late institutions. Carthage was founded by the king of Tyre who had a royal monopoly on this trading venture. Thus it was the royal authority stemming from this traditional source of power that the King of Carthage possessed. Later, as other Phoenician ship companies entered the trading region, and so associated with the city-state, the King of Carthage had to keep order among a rich variety of powerful merchants in their negotiations among themselves and over risky commerce across the Mediterranean. Under these circumstance, the office of king began to be transformed. Yet it was not until the aristocrats of Carthage became wealthy owners of agricultural lands in Africa that a council of elders was institutionalized at Carthage.<ref>Picard, ''Life and Death of Carthage'' (1968) at 80\u201386</ref>\n\n==Contemporary sources ==\n\nMost ancient literature concerning Carthage comes from Greek and Roman sources as Carthage's own documents were destroyed by the Romans.<ref>Picard, ''Life and Death of Carthage'' (1968, 1969) at 40\u201341 (Greeks), .</ref><ref>Cf., Warmington, ''Carthage'' (1960; Penguin 1964) at 24\u201325 (Greeks), 259\u2013260 (Romans).</ref> Apart from [[inscriptions]], hardly any Punic literature has survived, and none in its own language and script.<ref>B.H.Warmington, \"The Carthiginian Period\" at 246\u2013260, 246 (\"No Carthaginian literature has survived.\"), in ''General History of Africa, volume III.

A stronger condition on a set of integers is '''pairwise coprime''', which means that {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are coprime for every pair {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} of different integers in the set. The set {{math|{2, 3, 4}}} is coprime, but it is not pairwise coprime since 2 and 4 are not relatively prime.\n\n== Properties ==\nThe numbers 1 and \u22121 are the only integers coprime to every integer, and they are the only integers that are coprime with 0.\n\nA number of conditions are equivalent to {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} being coprime:\n*No [[prime number]] divides both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}.\n*There exist integers {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} such that {{math|1=''ax'' + ''by'' = 1}} (see [[B\u00e9zout's identity]]).\n*The integer {{math|''b''}} has a [[modular multiplicative inverse|multiplicative inverse]] modulo {{math|''a''}}, meaning that there exists an integer {{math|''y''}} such that {{math|''by'' \u2261 1 (mod ''a'')}}.

The numbers 4 and 9 are coprime. Therefore, the diagonal of a 4 \u00d7 9 lattice does not intersect any other [[square lattice|lattice points]]]]\n\nThe two integers ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime if and only if the point with coordinates (''a'', ''b'') in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is \"visible\" from the origin (0,0), in the sense that there is no point with integer coordinates on the line segment  between the origin and (''a'', ''b''). (See figure 1.)\n\nIn a sense that can be made precise, the [[probability]] that two randomly chosen integers are coprime is 6/\u03c0<sup>2</sup> (see [[pi]]), which is about 61%. See below.\n\nTwo [[natural number]]s ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime if and only if the numbers 2<sup>''a''</sup> &minus; 1 and 2<sup>''b''</sup> &minus; 1 are coprime.<ref>{{harvnb|Rosen|1992|loc=p. 140}}</ref> As a generalization of this, following easily from the [[Euclidean algorithm]] in [[Radix|base]] ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1:\n\n: <math>\\gcd\\left(n^a - 1, n^b - 1\\right) = n^{\\gcd(a, b)} - 1.</math>\n\n== Coprimality in sets ==\n\nA [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of integers ''S'' = {''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, .... ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>} can also be called ''coprime'' or ''setwise coprime'' if the [[greatest common divisor]] of all the elements of the set is 1.  For example, the integers 6, 10, 15 are coprime because 1 is the only positive integer that divides all of them.\n\nIf every pair in a set of integers is coprime, then the set is said to be ''pairwise coprime'' (or ''pairwise relatively prime'', ''mutually coprime'' or ''mutually relatively prime''). Pairwise coprimality is a stronger condition than setwise coprimality; every pairwise coprime finite set is also setwise coprime, but the reverse is not true. For example, the integers 4, 5, 6 are (setwise) coprime (because the only positive integer dividing ''all'' of them is 1), but they are not ''pairwise'' coprime (because gcd(4, 6) = 2).\n\nThe concept of pairwise coprimality is important as a hypothesis in many results in number theory, such as the [[Chinese remainder theorem]].\n\nIt is possible for an [[infinite set]] of integers to be pairwise coprime.  Notable examples include the set of all prime numbers, the set of elements in [[Sylvester's sequence]], and the set of all [[Fermat numbers]].\n\n== Coprimality in ring ideals ==\n\nTwo [[ring ideal|ideals]] ''A'' and ''B'' in the [[commutative ring]] ''R'' are called '''coprime''' (or '''comaximal''') if ''A'' + ''B'' = ''R''. This generalizes [[B\u00e9zout's identity]]: with this definition, two [[principal ideal]]s (''a'') and (''b'') in the ring of integers '''Z''' are coprime if and only if ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime. If the ideals ''A'' and ''B'' of ''R'' are coprime, then ''AB'' = ''A''\u2229''B''; furthermore, if ''C'' is a third ideal such that ''A'' contains ''BC'', then ''A'' contains ''C''. The [[Chinese remainder theorem]] can be generalized to any commutative ring, using coprime ideals.\n\n==Probability of coprimality ==\n\nGiven two randomly chosen integers ''a'' and ''b'', it is reasonable to ask how likely it is that ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime. In this determination, it is convenient to use the characterization that ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime if and only if no prime number divides both of them (see [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]).\n\nInformally, the probability that any number is divisible by a prime (or in fact any integer) <math>p</math> is <math>1/p</math>; for example, every 7th integer is divisible by 7. Hence the probability that two numbers are both divisible by ''p'' is <math>1/p^2</math>, and the probability that at least one of them is not is <math>1-1/p^2</math>.  Any finite collection of divisibility events associated to distinct primes is mutually independent.  For example, in the case of two events, a number is divisible by primes ''p'' and ''q'' if and only if it is divisible by ''pq''; the latter event has probability 1/''pq''.  If one makes the heuristic assumption that such reasoning can be extended to infinitely many divisibility events, one is led to guess that the probability that two numbers are coprime is given by a product over all primes,\n\n: <math>\\prod_{\\text{prime } p} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{p^2}\\right) = \\left( \\prod_{\\text{prime } p} \\frac{1}{1-p^{-2}} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\zeta(2)} = \\frac{6}{\\pi^2} \\approx 0.607927102 \\approx 61\\%.</math>\n\nHere ''&zeta;'' refers to the [[Riemann zeta function]], the identity relating the product over primes to ''&zeta;''(2) is an example of an [[Euler product]], and the evaluation of ''&zeta;''(2) as ''&pi;''<sup>2</sup>/6 is the [[Basel problem]], solved by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1735.\n\nThere is no way to choose a positive integer at random so that each positive integer occurs with equal probability, but statements about \"randomly chosen integers\" such as the ones above can be formalized by using the notion of ''[[natural density]]''.  For each positive integer ''N'', let ''P''<sub>''N''</sub> be the probability that two randomly chosen numbers in <math>\\{1,2,\\ldots,N\\}</math> are coprime.   Although ''P''<sub>''N''</sub> will never equal <math>6/\\pi^2</math> exactly, with work<ref>This theorem was proved by [[Ernesto Ces\u00e0ro]] in 1881. For a proof, see {{harvnb|Hardy|Wright|2008|loc=Theorem 332}}</ref> one can show that in the limit as <math>N \\to \\infty</math>, the probability <math>P_N</math> approaches <math>6/\\pi^2</math>.\n\nMore generally, the probability of ''k'' randomly chosen integers being coprime is <math>1/{\\zeta(k)}</math>.\n\n==Generating all coprime pairs==\n[[File:Coprime8.svg|300px|thumb|The order of generation of coprime pairs by this algorithm.

The result of these routed data movements through various digital circuits (sub-units) within the processor produces the manipulated data expected by a software instruction (loaded earlier, likely from memory). It controls (conducts) data flow inside the processor and additionally provides several external control signals to the rest of the computer to further direct data and instructions to/from processor external destinations (i.e. memory).{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nExamples of devices that require a CU are CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs). The CU receives external instructions or commands which it converts into a sequence of control signals that the CU applies to the data path to implement a sequence of [[register-transfer level]] operations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Englander|first=Irv|title=The Architecture of Computer Hardware, Systems Software, & Networking, 4th Ed.|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken}}</ref>\n\nMore precisely, the Control Unit (CU) is generally a sizable collection of complex digital circuitry interconnecting and directing the many execution units (i.e. ALU, data buffers, registers) contained within a CPU. The CU is normally the first CPU unit to accept from an externally stored computer program, a single instruction (based on the CPU's [[instruction set]]). The CU then decodes this individual instruction into several sequential steps (fetching addresses/data from registers/ memory, managing execution [i.e. data sent to the ALU or I/O], and storing the resulting data back into registers/memory) that controls and coordinates the CPU's inner works to properly manipulate the data. The design of these sequential steps are based on the needs of each instruction and can range in number of steps, the order of execution, and which units are enabled.\n\nThus by only using a program of set instructions in memory, the CU will configure all the CPU's data flows as needed to manipulate the data correctly between instructions. This results in a computer that could run a complete program and require no human intervention to make hardware changes between instructions (as had to be done when using only [[Plugboard#Unit record equipment|punch cards]] for computations before stored programmed computers with CUs were invented). These detailed steps from the CU dictate which of the CPU's interconnecting hardware control signals to enable/disable or which CPU units are selected/de-selected and the unit's proper order of execution as required by the instruction's operation to produce the desired manipulated data. Additionally, the CU's orderly hardware coordination properly sequences these control signals then configures the many hardware units comprising the CPU, directing how data should also be moved, changed, and stored outside the CPU (i.e. memory) according to the instruction's objective.\n\nDepending on the type of instruction entering the CU, the order and number of sequential steps produced by the CU could vary the selection and configuration of which parts of the CPU's hardware are utilized to achieve the instruction's objective (mainly moving, storing, and modifying data within the CPU). This one feature, that efficiently uses just software instructions to control/select/configure a computer's CPU hardware (via the CU) and eventually manipulates a program's data, is a significant reason most modern computers are flexible and universal when running various programs. As compared to some 1930s or 1940s computers without a proper CU, they often required rewiring their hardware when changing programs. This CU instruction decode process is then repeated when the Program Counter is incremented to the next stored program address and the new instruction enters the CU from that address, and so on till the programs end.\n\nOther more advanced forms of  Control Units manage the translation of instructions (but not the data containing portion) into several micro-instructions and the CU manages the scheduling of the micro-instructions between the selected execution units to which the data is then channeled and changed according to the execution unit's  function (i.e., ALU contains several functions). On some processors, the Control Unit may be further broken down into additional units, such as an [[instruction unit]] or scheduling unit to handle scheduling, or a retirement unit to deal with results coming from the [[instruction pipeline]]. Again, the Control Unit orchestrates the main functions of the CPU: carrying out stored instructions in the software program then directing the flow of data throughout the computer based upon these instructions (roughly likened to how traffic lights will systematically control the flow of cars [containing data] to different locations within the traffic grid [CPU] until it parks at the desired parking spot [memory address/register].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} The car occupants [data] then go into the building [execution unit] and comes back changed in some way then get back into the car and returns to another location via the controlled traffic grid).\n\n== Hardwired control unit ==<!-- Front end processor redirects here -->\n'''Hardwired control units''' are implemented through use of [[combinational logic]] units, featuring a finite number of gates that can generate specific results based on the instructions that were used to invoke those responses.

It is played by [[Bow (music)|bowing]] or [[pizzicato|plucking]] its four strings, which are usually [[intonation (music)|tuned]] in [[perfect fifth]]s an octave lower than the [[viola]]: from low to high, [[scientific pitch notation|C<sub>2</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and A<sub>3</sub>]]. It is the bass member of the [[violin family]], which also includes the [[violin]], viola and the [[double bass]], which doubles the bass line an octave lower than the cello in much of the orchestral repertoire. After the double bass, it is the second-largest and second lowest (in pitch) [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[string instrument]] in the modern symphony orchestra. The cello is used as a solo instrument, as well as in [[chamber music]] ensembles (e.g., [[string quartet]]), [[string orchestra]]s, as a member of the [[string section]] of [[symphony orchestra]]s, and some types of [[cello rock|rock bands]]. \n\nMusic for the cello is generally written in the [[bass clef]], but both [[tenor clef]] and [[treble clef]] are used for higher-range parts, both in orchestral/chamber music parts and in solo cello works. A person who plays the cello is called a ''cellist'' or ''violoncellist''. In a small classical ensemble, such as a string quartet, the cello typically plays the [[bassline|bass part]], the lowest-pitched musical line of the piece. In an [[orchestra]] of the [[Baroque era]] (ca. 1600\u20131750) and [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (ca. 1725\u20131800), the cello typically plays the bass part, generally doubled an octave lower by the double basses. In Baroque-era music, the cello is often used to play the [[basso continuo]] bassline, typically along with a [[keyboard instrument]] (e.g., [[pipe organ]] or [[harpsichord]]) or a fretted, plucked stringed instrument (e.g., [[lute]] or [[theorbo]]). In such a Baroque performance, the cello player might be joined or replaced by other bass instruments, playing [[bassoon]], [[double bass]], [[viol]] or other low-register instruments.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''cello'' is derived from the ending of the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''violoncello'',<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/violoncello|title=Violoncello |publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=October 4, 2016}}</ref> which means \"little [[violone]]\". The [[violone]] (\"big viol\") was the lowest-pitched instrument of the [[viol]] family, the group of stringed instruments that went out of fashion around the end of the 17th century in most countries except France, where they survived another half-century before the louder [[violin]] family came into greater favour in that country as well. In modern symphony orchestras, it is the second largest stringed instrument (the [[double bass]] is the largest). Thus, the name \"violoncello\" contained both the [[augmentative]] \"''-one''\" (\"big\") and the [[diminutive]] \"''-cello''\" (\"little\").

Contrary to a popular misconception, the cello did not evolve from the viola da gamba, but existed alongside it for about two and a half centuries. The violin family is also known as the viola da braccio (meaning viola of the arm) family, a reference to the primary way the members of the family are held. This is to distinguish it from the viola da gamba (meaning viola of the leg) family, in which all the members are all held with the legs. The likely predecessors of the violin family include the [[lira da braccio]] and the [[rebec]]. The earliest surviving cellos are made by [[Andrea Amati]], the first known member of the celebrated [[Amati]] family of [[luthier]]s.<ref>.[http://collections.nmmusd.org/Cellos/Amati/Amaticello.html]</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}}<!--The instrument described is clearly stated to have been a three-string bass, later cut down and remade into a cello.-->\n\nThe direct ancestor to the violoncello was the [[bass violin]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Monteverdi referred to the instrument as \"basso de viola da braccio\" in ''Orfeo'' (1607). Although the first [[bass violin]], possibly invented as early as 1538, was most likely inspired by the viol, it was created to be used in consort with the violin. The bass violin was actually often referred to as a \"''violone''\", or \"large viola\", as were the viols of the same period. Instruments that share features with both the bass violin and the ''viola da gamba'' appear in Italian art of the early 16th century.\n\nThe invention of wire-wound [[String (music)|strings]] (fine wire around a thin gut core), around 1660 in [[Bologna]], allowed for a finer bass sound than was possible with purely gut strings on such a short body. Bolognese makers exploited this new technology to create the cello, a somewhat smaller instrument suitable for solo repertoire due to both the timbre of the instrument and the fact that the smaller size made it easier to play [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] passages.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} This instrument had disadvantages as well, however. The cello's light sound was not as suitable for church and ensemble playing, so it had to be doubled by [[organ (music)|organ]], [[theorbo]] or [[violone]].\n\nAround 1700, Italian players popularized the cello in northern Europe, although the bass violin (basse de violon) continued to be used for another two decades in France.{{citation needed|date=November 2007}}<!--I believe you, I would just like to know where you got the info--> Many existing bass violins were literally cut down in size to convert them into cellos according to the smaller pattern developed by [[Stradivarius]], who also made a number of old pattern large cellos (the 'Servais').<ref name=\"vrzuok\" >{{Cite journal|last= Cyr |first= Mary |title= Basses and basse continue in the Orchestra of the Paris Op\u00e9ra 1700\u20131764 |journal= Early Music |volume= X |issue= Apr., 1982 |pages= 155\u2013170 |doi=10.1093/earlyj/10.2.155|ref=harv }}\n</ref> The sizes, names, and tunings of the cello varied widely by geography and time.<ref name=\"vrzuok\"/> The size was not standardized until around 1750.\n\nDespite similarities to the [[viol|viola da gamba]], the cello is actually part of the [[viola da braccio]] family, meaning \"viol of the arm\", which includes, among others, the [[violin]] and [[viola]]. Though paintings like [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Bruegel]]'s \"The Rustic Wedding\", and [[Philibert Jambe de Fer|Jambe de Fer]] in his ''Epitome Musical'' suggest that the bass violin had alternate playing positions, these were short-lived and the more practical and ergonomic ''a gamba'' position eventually replaced them entirely.\n\n[[File:Cello strung gut.JPG|thumb|right|A baroque cello strung with gut strings. Note the absence of fine-tuning pins on the tailpiece.]]\n[[Baroque]]-era cellos differed from the modern instrument in several ways. The neck has a different form and angle, which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing.{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}<!--What?!--> Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theclassymusician.com/blog/the-endpin |title=The Endpin \u2013 The Classy Musician |website=Theclassymusician.com |date=March 7, 2016  |author=Marsh, Gregory and Elizabeth |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}</ref> while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the [[Bow frog|frog]]; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of [[Catgut|gut]], with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which make it much easier to tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello,{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.\n\nFew educational works specifically devoted to the cello existed before the 18th century, and those that do exist contain little value to the performer beyond simple accounts of instrumental technique. One of the earliest cello manuals is [[Michel Corrette]]'s ''M\u00e9thode, th\u00e8orique et pratique pour apprendre en peu de temps le violoncelle dans sa perfection'' (Paris, 1741).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cello.org/heaven/wasiel/18italy.htm |title=Cello Playing in 18th Century Italy |website=Cello.org |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Modern use==\n\n===Orchestral===\n[[File:FHM-Orchestra-mk2006-03.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cello section of the orchestra of the Munich University of Applied Sciences is shown here.]]\nCellos are part of the standard [[symphony orchestra]], which usually includes eight to twelve cello players. The cello section, in standard orchestral seating, is located on stage left (the audience's right) in the front, opposite the first violin section. However, some orchestras and conductors prefer switching the positioning of the viola and cello sections. The ''principal'' cellist is the section leader, determining bowings for the section in conjunction with other string principals, playing solos and leading entrances (when the section begins to play its part). Principal players always sit closest to the audience.\n\nThe cellos are a critical part of orchestral music; all symphonic works involve the cello section, and many pieces require cello soli or solos. Much of the time, cellos provide part of the low-register harmony for the orchestra. Often, the cello section plays the melody for a brief period, before returning to the harmony role. There are also cello [[concerto]]s, which are orchestral pieces that feature a solo cellist accompanied by an entire orchestra.\n\n===Solo===\nThere are numerous [[cello concerto]]s \u2013 where a solo cello is accompanied by an [[orchestra]] \u2013 notably 25 by [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], 12 by [[Luigi Boccherini|Boccherini]], at least 3 by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], 3 by [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;E. Bach]], 2 by [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], 2 by [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], and one each by [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[\u00c9douard Lalo|Lalo]], and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]. There were also some cellists who, while not otherwise composers, did write cello-specific repertoire, such as [[Nikolaus Kraft]] who wrote six cello concertos. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] for Cello, Violin and Piano and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] for Cello and Violin are also part of the concertante repertoire although in both cases the cello shares solo duties with at least one other instrument. Moreover, several composers wrote large-scale pieces for cello and orchestra, which are concertos in all but name. Some familiar \"concertos\" are [[Richard Strauss]]' [[tone poem]] ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'', [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'', [[Ernest Bloch|Bloch]]'s ''[[Schelomo]]'' and [[Max Bruch|Bruch]]'s ''[[Kol Nidrei (Bruch)|Kol Nidrei]]''.\n\nIn the 20th century, the cello repertoire grew immensely. This was partly due to the influence of virtuoso cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who inspired, commissioned and premiered dozens of new works. Among these, [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Symphony-Concerto (Prokofiev)|Symphony-Concerto]]'', [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]'s ''[[Cello Symphony]]'', the concertos of [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]] and [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski|Lutos\u0142awski]] as well as [[Henri Dutilleux|Dutilleux]]'s ''[[Tout un monde lointain...]]'' have already become part of the standard repertoire. Other major composers who wrote concertante works for him include [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]], [[Andr\u00e9 Jolivet|Jolivet]], [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]]. In addition, [[Malcolm Arnold|Arnold]], [[Samuel Barber|Barber]], [[Philip Glass|Glass]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti|Ligeti]], [[Nikolai Myaskovsky|Myaskovsky]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]], [[Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo|Rodrigo]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos|Villa-Lobos]] and [[William Walton|Walton]] also wrote major [[List of compositions for cello and orchestra|concertos]] for other cellists, notably for [[Gaspar Cassad\u00f3]], [[Aldo Parisot]], [[Gregor Piatigorsky]], [[Siegfried Palm]] and [[Julian Lloyd Webber]].\n\nThere are also many [[cello sonata|sonatas]] for cello and [[piano]]. Those written by [[Beethoven]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Brahms]], [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9|Faur\u00e9]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], [[Elliott Carter|Carter]], and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]] are particularly well known.\n\nOther important pieces for cello and piano include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s five ''St\u00fccke im Volkston'' and transcriptions like [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s [[Arpeggione Sonata]] (originally for [[arpeggione]] and piano), [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s [[Cello Sonata (Franck/Delsart)|Cello Sonata]] (originally a violin sonata, transcribed by [[Jules Delsart]] with the composer's approval), [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)#Suite italienne|Suite italienne]]'' (transcribed by the composer \u2013 with [[Gregor Piatigorsky]] \u2013 from his ballet ''Pulcinella'') and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s first rhapsody (also transcribed by the composer, originally for violin and piano).\n\nThere are pieces for [[List of solo cello pieces|cello solo]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.&nbsp;S. Bach]]'s six [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Suites for Cello]] (which are among the best-known solo cello pieces), [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly|Kod\u00e1ly]]'s [[Sonata for Solo Cello (Kod\u00e1ly)|Sonata for Solo Cello]] and Britten's three [[Cello Suites (Britten)|Cello Suites]]. Other notable examples include [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]]'s and [[Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe|Ysa\u00ffe]]'s Sonatas for Solo Cello, Dutilleux's ''Trois Strophes sur le Nom de Sacher'', Berio's ''Les Mots Sont All\u00e9s'', [[Gaspar Cassad\u00f3|Cassad\u00f3]]'s Suite for Solo Cello, [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti|Ligeti]]'s [[Sonata for Solo Cello (Ligeti)|Solo Sonata]], Carter's two ''Figment''s and [[Iannis Xenakis|Xenakis]]' ''[[Nomos Alpha]]'' and ''Kottos''.\n\n===Quartets and other ensembles===\nThe cello is a member of the traditional [[string quartet]] as well as [[string quintets]], [[string sextet|sextet]] or [[string trio|trios]] and other mixed ensembles.\nThere are also pieces written for two, three, four or more cellos; this type of ensemble is also called a \"cello choir\" and its sound is familiar from the introduction to [[Rossini]]'s [[William Tell Overture]] as well as Zaccharia's prayer scene in [[Verdi]]'s [[Nabucco]]. [[Tchaikovsky]]'s [[1812 Overture]] also starts with a cello ensemble, with four cellos playing the top lines and two violas playing the bass lines.  As a self-sufficient ensemble, its most famous repertoire is [[Villa-Lobos]]' first of his [[Bachianas Brasileiras]] for cello ensemble (the fifth is for soprano and 8 cellos). Other examples are [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s cello duets, quartet, and sextet, [[P\u00e4rt]]'s [[Fratres]] for 8 cellos and [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]]' ''Messagesquisse'' for 7 cellos, or even Villa-Lobos' rarely played ''Fantasia Concertante'' (1958) for 32 cellos. The 12 cellists of the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] (or \"the Twelve\" as they have since taken to being called) specialize in this repertoire and have commissioned many works, including arrangements of well-known popular songs.\n\n===Popular music, jazz, world music and neoclassical===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\n[[File:Apocalyptica - Ilosaarirock 2009.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Apocalyptica]] at the 2009 [[Ilosaarirock]] festival.]]\nThe cello is less common in [[popular music]] than in classical music. Several bands feature a cello in their standard line-up, e.g. Joe Kwon of [[The Avett Brothers]]. The more common use in [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] is to bring the instrument in for a particular song. In the 1960s, artists such as [[the Beatles]] and [[Cher]] used the cello in popular music, in songs such as The Beatles' \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]\", \"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\" and \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\", and Cher's \"[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]\". \"[[Good Vibrations]]\" by [[the Beach Boys]] includes the cello in its instrumental ensemble, which includes a number of instruments unusual for this sort of music. Bass guitarist [[Jack Bruce]], who had  originally studied music on a performance scholarship for cello, played a prominent cello part in \"As You Said\" on [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s ''[[Wheels of Fire]]'' studio album (1968).\n\nIn the 1970s, the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] enjoyed great commercial success taking inspiration from so-called \"Beatlesque\" arrangements, adding the cello (and violin) to the standard rock combo line-up and in 1978 the UK based rock band, [[Colosseum II]], collaborated with cellist Julian Lloyd Webber on the recording ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]''. Most notably, [[Pink Floyd]] included a cello solo in their 1970 epic instrumental \"[[Atom Heart Mother (suite)|Atom Heart Mother]]\". Bass guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]] of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] was originally a cellist and included some cello parts in their ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' album.\n\nEstablished non-traditional cello groups include [[Apocalyptica]], a group of Finnish cellists best known for their versions of [[Metallica]] songs, [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]], a group of cellists committed to an intricate cello style intermingled with Gothic music, the [[Massive Violins]], an ensemble of seven singing cellists known for their arrangements of rock, pop and classical hits, Von Cello, a cello fronted rock power trio, [[Break of Reality]] who mix elements of classical music with the more modern rock and metal genre, [[Cello Fury]], a cello rock band that performs original rock/classical crossover music, and Jelloslave, a Minneapolis-based Cello duo with two percussionists. These groups are examples of a style that has become known as [[cello rock]]. The crossover string quartet [[Bond (band)|bond]] also includes a cellist. Silenzium and Cellissimo Quartet are [[Russia]]n (Novosibirsk) groups playing rock and metal and having more and more popularity in [[Siberia]]. [[Cold Fairyland]] from [[Shanghai]], [[China]] is using a cello along a [[Pipa]] as the main solo instrument to create East meets West progressive (folk) rock.\n\nMore recent bands using the cello are [[Aerosmith]], [[The Auteurs]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[James (band)|James]], [[Talk Talk]], [[Phillip Phillips]], [[OneRepublic]], and the [[baroque rock]] band [[Arcade Fire]]. An Atlanta-based trio, King Richard's Sunday Best, also uses a cellist in their lineup. So-called \"chamber pop\" artists like [[Kronos Quartet]], The Vitamin String Quartet and Margot and the Nuclear So and So's have also recently made cello common in modern alternative rock. Heavy metal band [[System of a Down]] has also made use of the cello's rich sound. The indie rock band [[The Stiletto Formal]] are known for using a cello as a major staple of their sound, similarly, the indie rock band [[Canada (music group)|Canada]] employs two cello players in their lineup. The orch-rock group, [[The Polyphonic Spree]], which has pioneered the use of stringed and symphonic instruments, employs the cello in very creative ways for many of their \"[[psychedelia|psychedelic]]-esque\" melodies. The first wave [[screamo]] band ''I Would Set Myself On Fire For You'' featured a cello as well as a viola to create a more [[Folk music|folk]]-oriented sound. The band, [[Panic! at the Disco]] uses a cello in their song, \"Build God, Then We'll Talk\". The lead vocalist of the band, [[Brendon Urie]], also did the recording of the cello solo. [[The Lumineers]] added cellist Nela Pekarek to the band in 2010. She plays cello, sings harmony and duets.\n\nIn [[jazz]], bassists [[Oscar Pettiford]] and [[Harry Babasin]] were among the first to use the cello as a solo instrument; both tuned their instrument in fourths, an octave above the double bass. [[Fred Katz (cellist)|Fred Katz]] (who was not a bassist) was one of the first notable jazz cellists to use the instrument's standard tuning and arco technique. Contemporary jazz cellists include [[Abdul Wadud (musician)|Abdul Wadud]], [[Diedre Murray]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Dave Holland]], [[David Darling (musician)|David Darling]], [[Lucio Amanti]], Akua Dixon, [[Ernst Reijseger]], [[Fred Lonberg-Holm]], [[Tom Cora]] and [[Erik Friedlander]]. Modern musical theatre pieces like Jason Robert Brown's [[The Last Five Years]], Duncan Sheik's [[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]], Adam Guettel's [[Floyd Collins (musical)|Floyd Collins]], and Ricky Ian Gordon's [[My Life with Albertine]] use small string ensembles (including solo cellos) to a prominent extent.\n\nIn Indian Classical music [[Saskia Rao-de Haas]] is a well established soloist as well as playing duets with her sitarist husband Pt. [[Shubhendra Rao]]. Other cellists performing Indian classical music are: Nancy Lesh (Dhrupad) and Anup Biswas. Both Rao and Lesh play the cello sitting cross-legged on the floor.\n\nThe cello can also be used in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[folk music]], with notable players including [[Ben Sollee]] of the [[Sparrow Quartet]] and the \"Cajun cellist\" Sean Grissom, as well as [[Vyvienne Long]] who, in addition to her own projects, has played for those of [[Damien Rice]]. Cellists such as [[Natalie Haas]], Abby Newton and Liz Davis Maxfield have contributed significantly to the use of cello playing in Celtic folk music, often with the cello featured as a primary melodic instrument and employing the skills and techniques of traditional fiddle playing. [[Lindsay Mac]] is becoming well known for playing the cello like a guitar, with her cover of [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]\".\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Cello Parts.jpg|thumb|Main parts of the cello|230px]]\nThe cello is typically made from carved wood, although other materials such as [[carbon fiber]] or aluminum may be used. A traditional cello has a [[spruce]] top, with [[maple]] for the back, sides, and neck. Other woods, such as [[Populus|poplar]] or [[willow]], are sometimes used for the back and sides. Less expensive cellos frequently have tops and backs made of [[Plywood|laminated wood]]. Laminated cellos are widely used in elementary and secondary school orchestras and [[youth orchestra]]s, because they are much more durable than carved wood cellos (i.e., they are less likely to crack if bumped or dropped) and they are much less expensive.\n\nThe top and back are traditionally hand-carved, though less expensive cellos are often machine-produced. The sides, or ribs, are made by heating the wood and bending it around forms. The cello body has a wide top bout, narrow middle formed by two C-bouts, and wide bottom bout, with the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] and [[F holes]] just below the middle. The top and back of the cello has decorative border inlay known as [[purfling]]. While purfling is attractive, it is also functional: if the instrument is struck, the purfling can prevent cracking of the wood. A crack may form at the rim of the instrument, but spreads no further. Without purfling, cracks can spread up or down the top or back. Playing, traveling and the weather all affect the cello and can increase a crack if purfling is not in place. Less expensive instruments typically have painted purfling.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n===Alternative materials===\nCello manufacturer [[Luis and Clark|Luis & Clark]] constructs cellos from [[carbon fibre]]. Carbon fibre instruments are particularly suitable for outdoor playing because of the strength of the material and its resistance to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Luis & Clark has produced over 1000 cellos, some of which are owned by cellists such as [[Yo-Yo Ma]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/arts/music/19carb.html?_r=0 |title=Cold Case: Luis and Clark Carbon Expedition for Yo-Yo Ma? |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 18, 2009 |author=Chris Museler |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}</ref> and [[Josephine van Lier]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=van Lier|first1=Josephine|title=Luis and Clark Carbon Fibre Cells|url=http://www.albertastringassociation.ca/docs/ASANewsletterSummer2006.pdf|website=Alberta String Association|accessdate=4 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407090955/http://www.albertastringassociation.ca/docs/ASANewsletterSummer2006.pdf|archivedate=April 7, 2014|date=2006}}</ref> In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) as well as German luthier G.A. Pfretzschner produced an unknown number of aluminum cellos (in addition to aluminum double basses and violins).\n\n===Neck, fingerboard, pegbox, and scroll===\nAbove the main body is the carved neck. The neck has a curved cross-section on its underside, which is where the player's thumb runs along the neck during playing. The neck which leads to a [[pegbox]] and the [[scroll (music)|scroll]]. The neck, pegbox, and scroll are normally carved out of a single piece of wood, usually [[maple]]. The [[fingerboard]] is glued to the neck and extends over the body of the instrument. The fingerboard is given a curved shape, matching the curve on the bridge. Both the fingerboard and bridge need to be curved so that the performer can bow individual strings. If the cello were to have a flat fingerboard and bridge, as with a typical guitar, the performer would only be able to bow the \"outer\" two strings or bow all the strings. The performer would not be able to play the \"inner\" two strings alone.\n\nThe [[Nut (instrumental)|nut]] is a raised piece of wood, fitted where the fingerboard meets the pegbox, in which the strings rest in shallow slots or grooves to keep them the correct distance apart. The pegbox houses four tapered [[tuning peg]]s, one for each string. The pegs are used to tune the cello by either tightening or loosening the string. The pegs are called \"friction pegs\", because they maintain their position by friction. The scroll is a traditional ornamental part of the cello and a feature of all other members of the [[violin family]]. [[Ebony]] is usually used for the tuning pegs, fingerboard, and nut, but other hardwoods, such as [[Buxus|boxwood]] or [[rosewood]], can be used. Black fittings on low-cost instruments are often made from inexpensive wood that has been blackened or \"ebonized\" to look like [[ebony]], which is much harder and more expensive. Ebonised parts such as tuning pegs may crack or split, and the black surface of the fingerboard will eventually wear down to reveal the lighter wood underneath.\n\n===Strings===\nHistorically, cello [[String (music)|strings]] had cores made out of [[catgut]], which, despite its name is made from sheep or goat intestines which are dried out. Most modern strings used in the 2010s are wound with metallic materials like [[aluminum]], [[titanium]] and [[chromium]]. Cellists may mix different types of strings on their instruments. The pitches of the open strings are C, G, D, and A (black note heads in the playing range figure above), unless alternative tuning ([[scordatura]]) is specified by the composer. Some composers (e.g. [[Ottorino Respighi]] in the final movement of \u2018\u2019[[The Pines of Rome]]\u2019\u2019) ask that the low C be tuned down to a B{{Music|b}} or B so that the performer can play a different low note on the lowest open string.\n\n===Tailpiece and endpin===\nThe [[tailpiece]] and [[endpin]] are found in the lower part of the cello. The tailpiece is the part of the cello to which the \"ball ends\" of the strings are attached by passing them through holes. The tailpiece is attached to the bottom of the cello. The tailpiece is traditionally made of [[ebony]] or another hard wood, but can also be made of [[plastic]] or [[steel]] on lower-cost instruments. It attaches the strings to the lower end of the cello, and can have one or more fine tuners. The fine tuners are used to make smaller adjustments to the pitch of the string. The fine tuners can increase the tension of each string (raising the pitch) or decrease the tension of the string (lowering the pitch). When the performer is putting on a new string, the fine tuner for that string is normally reset to a middle position, and then the peg is turned to bring the string up to pitch. The fine turners are used for subtle, minor adjustments to pitch, such as tuning a cello to the oboe's 440&nbsp;Hz A note or to tune the cello to a piano.\n\nThe endpin or spike is made of wood, metal or rigid carbon fibre and supports the cello in playing position. The endpin can be retracted into the hollow body of the instrument when the cello is being transported in its case. This makes the cello easier to move about. When the performer wishes to play the cello, the endpin is pulled out to lengthen it. The endpin is locked into the player's preferred length with a screw mechanism. The adjustable nature of endpins enables performers of different ages and body sizes to adjust the endpin length to suit them.  In the Baroque period the cello was held between the calves, as there was no endpin at that time. The endpin was \"introduced by Adrien Servais {{circa}} 1845 to give the instrument greater stability\".<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite book|last=Stowell|first=Robin|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Cello|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvlhQgAACAAJ|date=June 28, 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62101-4}}</ref> Modern endpins are retractable and adjustable; older ones were removed when not in use. (The word \"endpin\" sometimes also refers to the button of wood located at this place in all instruments in the violin family, but this is usually called \"tailpin\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/stringed-instrument |title=Stringed instrument |website=britannica.com |author=Eric Halfpenny |author2=Theodore C Grame |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}</ref>) The sharp tip of the cello's endpin is sometimes capped with a rubber tip that protects the tip from dulling and prevents the cello from slipping on the floor. Many cellists use a rubber pad with a metal cup to keep the tip from slipping on the floor. A number of accessories to keep the endpin from slipping; these include ropes which attach to the chair leg and other devices.\n\n===Bridge and f-holes===\n[[File:Cello bridge2.JPG|right|thumb|The bridge of a cello, with a mute (the mute is not in use)]]\nThe [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] holds the strings above the cello and transfers their vibrations to the top of the instrument and the soundpost inside (see below). The bridge is not glued, but rather held in place by the tension of the strings. The bridge is usually positioned by the cross point of the \"f-hole\" (i.e., where the horizontal line occurs in the \"f\"). The [[sound-hole|f-holes]], named for their shape, are located on either side of the bridge, and allow air to move in and out of the instrument as part of the sound-production process.  They probably actually stand for an old style medial S, for words related to Sound.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The f-holes also act as access points to the interior of the cello for repairs or maintenance. Sometimes a small length of rubber hose containing a water-soaked sponge, called a Dampit, is inserted through the f-holes, and serves as a humidifier. This keeps the wood components of the cello from drying out.\n\n===Internal features===\nInternally, the cello has two important features: a [[bass bar]], which is glued to the underside of the top of the instrument, and a round wooden [[sound post]], a solid wooden cylinder which is wedged between the top and bottom plates. The bass bar, found under the bass foot of the bridge, serves to support the cello's top and distribute the vibrations from the strings to the body of the instrument. The sound post, found under the treble side of the bridge, connects the back and front of the cello. Like the bridge, the sound post is not glued, but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings. Together, the bass bar and sound post transfer the strings' vibrations to the top (front) of the instrument (and to a lesser extent the back), acting as a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] to produce the instrument's sound.\n\n===Glue===\nCellos are constructed and repaired using [[hide glue]], which is strong but reversible, allowing for disassembly when needed. Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs call for the removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks side-to-side, the glue holding it lets go, so the plate does not crack. Cellists repairing cracks in their cello do not use regular [[wood glue]], because it cannot be steamed open when a repair has to be made by a [[luthier]].\n\n===Bow===\n[[File:Bow hand Violoncello.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|A cello French bow<ref>As opposed to the German bow popular in baroque era, held underhand.</ref> ''sul ponticello'']]\nTraditionally, [[bow (music)|bows]] are made from [[Paubrasilia|pernambuco]] or [[brazilwood]]. Both come from the same species of tree (''Caesalpinia echinata''), but pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the heartwood of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity, <!--and high sound velocity-->which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows. Horsehair is stretched out between the two ends of the bow. The taut horsehair is drawn over the strings to produce the cello's characteristic tone. A small knob is twisted to increase or decrease the tension of the horsehair. The tension on the bow is released when the instrument is not being used. The amount of tension a cellist puts on the bow hair depends on the preferences of the player, the style of music being played, and for students, the preferences of their teacher.\n\nBows are also made from other materials, such as carbon-fibre\u2014stronger than wood\u2014and fiberglass (often used to make inexpensive, lower-quality student bows). An average cello bow is {{convert|73|cm|in|abbr=on}} long (shorter than a violin or viola bow) {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} high (from the frog to the stick) and {{convert|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The frog of a cello bow typically has a rounded corner like that of a viola bow, but is wider. A cello bow is roughly {{convert|10|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier than a viola bow, which in turn is roughly {{convert|10|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier than a violin bow. <!-- for example, see http://www.codabow.com/info_buyfirstbow.html -->\n\nBow hair is traditionally [[horsehair]], though synthetic hair, in varying colors, is also used. Prior to playing, the musician tightens the bow by turning a screw to pull the frog (the part of the bow under the hand) back, and increase the tension of the hair. [[Rosin]] is applied by the player to make the hairs sticky. Bows need to be re-haired periodically. [[Baroque]] style (1600\u20131750) cello bows were much thicker and were formed with a larger outward arch when compared to modern cello bows. The inward arch of a modern cello bow produces greater tension, which in turn gives off a louder sound.\n\nThe cello bow has also been used to play [[electric guitar]]s. Jimmy Page pioneered its application on tracks such as \"[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]\". The [[post-rock]] [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] band [[Sigur R\u00f3s]]'s lead singer often plays a guitar using a cello bow.\n\nIn 1989, the German cellist [[Michael Bach (musician)|Michael Bach]] began developing a [[curved bow]], encouraged by [[John Cage]], [[Dieter Schnebel]], Mstislav Rostropovich and [[Luigi Colani]]: and since then many pieces have been composed especially for it. This curved bow (''BACH.Bow'') is a convex curved bow which, unlike the ordinary bow, renders possible polyphonic playing on the various strings of the instrument. The solo repertoire for violin and cello by J. S. Bach the BACH.Bow is particularly suited to it: and it was developed with this in mind, polyphonic playing being required, as well as monophonic.\n\n[[File:Michael Bach, Cello with BACH.Bow.jpg|thumb|Michael Bach, Cello with [[curved bow|BACH.Bow]]]]\n\n==Physics==\n\n===Physical aspects===\nWhen a string is bowed or plucked, it vibrates and moves the air around it, producing sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not much air is moved by the string itself, and consequently if the string was not mounted on a hollow body, the sound would be weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger hollow wooden body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. Different designs of the instrument produces variations in the instrument\u2019s vibrational patterns and thus changes the character of the sound produced.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cowling|first=Elizabeth|title=The cello|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46gXAQAAIAAJ|year=1983|publisher=C. Scribner's Sons|isbn=978-0-684-17870-7}}</ref> A string\u2019s fundamental pitch can be adjusted by changing its stiffness, which depends on tension and length.

Shortening a string stiffens it by increasing its curvature during a distortion and subjecting it to larger net forces. Shortening the string also reduces its mass,  but does not alter the mass per unit length,  and it is the latter ratio rather than the total mass which governs the frequency.   The string vibrates in a standing wave whose speed of propagation is given by {{sqrt|''T''/''m''}},  where ''T'' is the tension and ''m'' is the mass per unit length;    there is a node at either end of the vibrating length,  and thus the vibrating length ''l'' is half a wavelength.    Since the frequency of any wave is equal to the speed divided by the wavelength,  we have frequency = {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|2''l''}} \u00d7 {{sqrt|''T''/''m''}}}}.   (Note that some writers,  including Muncaster (cited below) use the Greek letter ''\u03bc'' in place of ''m''.) Thus shortening a string increases the frequency,  and thus the pitch. Because of this effect, you can raise and change the pitch of a string by pressing it against the fingerboard in the cello\u2019s neck and effectively shortening it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Muncaster|first=Roger|title=A-level Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Knov8XAyf2cC|year=1993|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-1584-8}}</ref> Likewise strings with less mass per unit length,  if under the same tension,  will have a higher frequency and thus higher pitch than more massive strings.   This is a prime reason why the different strings on all string instruments have different fundamental pitches,  with the lightest strings having the highest pitches.\n\nA played note of E or F{{music|#}} has a frequency which is often very close to the natural resonating frequency of the body of the instrument,  and if the problem is not addressed this can set the body into near resonance.   This may cause an unpleasant sudden amplification of this pitch,  and additionally a loud beating sound results from the interference produced between these nearby frequencies; this is known as the \u201c[[wolf tone]]\u201d because it is an unpleasant growling sound. The wood resonance appears to be split into two frequencies by the driving force of the sounding string. These two periodic resonances beat with each other. This wolf tone must be eliminated or significantly reduced for the cello to play the nearby notes with a pleasant tone. This can be accomplished by modifying the cello front plate, attaching a wolf eliminator (a metal cylinder or a rubber cylinder encased in metal), or moving the sound post.<ref name=\"Berg, Richard E 2005. pp 314, 329\">{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Richard E.|last2=Stork|first2=David G.|title=The Physics of Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FpgQgAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-145789-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Spectrogram Cello D Arpeggio.png|thumb|100 px|[[Spectrogram]] of a D chord arpeggiated on the cello.

Each sound has a particular recipe of frequencies that combine to make the total sound.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chattopadhyay|first=D.|title=Elements Of Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eA7g3aXePRoC|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-1538-4}}</ref>\n\n==Playing technique==\n{{main|Cello technique}}\n[[File:Cello KSG 9829 PK.jpg|thumb|A cellist]]\nPlaying the cello is done while seated with the instrument supported on the floor by the endpin. The left hand fingertips stop the strings on the fingerboard, determining the pitch of the fingered note. The right hand plucks or bows the strings to sound the notes. The left hand fingertips stop the strings along their length, determining the pitch of each fingered note. Stopping the string closer to the bridge results in  higher-pitched sound, because the vibrating string length has been shortened. In the ''neck'' positions (which use just less than half of the fingerboard, nearest the top of the instrument), the thumb rests on the back of the neck; in ''[[thumb position]]'' (a general name for notes on the remainder of the fingerboard) the thumb usually rests alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes. The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, with the fingertips in contact with the string. If a finger is required on two (or more) strings at once to play perfect fifths (in double stops or chords) it is used flat. In slower, or more expressive playing, the contact point can move slightly away from the nail to the pad of the finger, allowing a fuller vibrato.\n\n[[Vibrato]] is a small oscillation in the pitch of a note, usually considered expressive. [[Harmonics]] played on the cello fall into two classes; natural and artificial. Natural harmonics are produced by lightly touching (but not depressing) the string with the finger at certain places, and then bowing (or, rarely, plucking) the string. For example, the halfway point of the string will produce a harmonic that is one octave above the unfingered (open) string. Natural harmonics only produce notes that are part of the [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] on a particular string. Artificial harmonics (also called false harmonics or stopped harmonics), in which the player depresses the string fully with one finger while touching the same string lightly with another finger, can produce any note above middle C. \n[[Glissando]] (Italian for \"sliding\") is an effect played by sliding the finger up or down the fingerboard without releasing the string. This causes the pitch to rise and fall smoothly, without separate, discernible steps.\n\nIn cello playing, the bow is much like the breath of a [[wind instrument]] player. Arguably, it is the major determinant in the expressiveness of the playing. The right hand holds the bow and controls the duration and character of the notes. The bow is drawn across the strings roughly halfway between the end of the [[fingerboard]] and the bridge, in a direction perpendicular to the strings. The bow is held with all five fingers of the right hand, the thumb opposite the fingers and closer to the cellist's body. Tone production and volume of sound depend on a combination of several factors. The three most important ones are: bow speed, weight applied to the string, and point of contact of the bow hair with the string.\n\n[[Double stop]]s involve the playing of two notes at the same time. Two strings are fingered simultaneously, and the bow is drawn so as to sound them both at once. In [[pizzicato]] playing, the string is plucked directly with the fingers or thumb. Pizzicato is often abbreviated as \"Pizz.\". Position of the hand is slightly over the finger board and away from the bridge.\n\nA player using the [[col legno]] technique strikes or rubs the strings with the wood of the bow rather than the hair. In [[spiccato]] playing, the strings are not \"drawn\" by the bow hair but struck by it, while still retaining some horizontal motion, to generate a more percussive, crisp sound. In [[staccato]], the player moves the bow a small distance and stops it on the string, making a short sound, the rest of the written duration being taken up by silence. \n[[Legato]] is a technique where the notes are smoothly connected without accents or breaks. It is noted by a slur (curved line) above or below \u2013 depending on their position on the staff \u2013 the notes of the passage that is to be played legato.\n\n''Sul ponticello'' (\"on the bridge\") refers to bowing closer to the bridge, while ''sul tasto'' (\"on the fingerboard\") calls for bowing nearer the end of the fingerboard. Sul tasto produces a more flute-like sound, with more emphasis on the fundamental frequency of the note, and softer overtones.\n\n==Sizes==\n[[File:Full size and fractional cello.jpg|thumb|{{frac|1|8}} size cello with full size cello]]\nStandard-sized cellos are referred to as \"full-size\" or \"{{frac|4|4}}\" but are also made in smaller (fractional) sizes (e.g. {{frac|7|8}}, {{frac|3|4}}, {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|1|8}}, {{frac|1|10}}, {{frac|1|16}}). The fractions refer to volume rather than length, so a 1/2 size cello is much longer than half the length of a full size.  The smaller cellos are identical to standard cellos in construction, range, and usage, but are simply scaled-down for the benefit of children and shorter adults.\n\nCellos in sizes larger than {{frac|4|4}} do exist, and cellists with unusually large hands may require such a non-standard instrument. Cellos made before approximately 1700 tended to be considerably larger than those made and commonly played today. Around 1680, changes in string-making technology made it possible to play lower-pitched notes on shorter strings. The cellos of [[Stradivari]], for example, can be clearly divided into two models: the style made before 1702, characterized by larger instruments (of which only three exist in their original size and configuration), and the style made during and after 1707, when Stradivari began making smaller cellos. This later model is the design most commonly used by modern luthiers. The [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]] of a {{frac|4|4}} cello is about {{convert|27+1/2|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The new size offered fuller tonal projection and greater range of expression. The instrument in this form was able to contribute to more pieces musically and offered the possibility of greater physical dexterity for the player to develop technique.<ref name=\"size\">{{cite book|last=Stowell|first=Robin|title=The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bJAZU27hWEC|date=November 13, 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00042-0}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The following luthiers are notable for the cellos they have produced:\n*[[Nicol\u00f2 Amati]] and others in the Amati family\n*[[Nicol\u00f2 Gagliano]]\n*[[Matteo Goffriller]]\n*[[Giovanni Battista Guadagnini]]\n*[[Giuseppe Guarneri]]\n*[[Charles Menn\u00e9gand]]\n*[[Domenico Montagnana]]\n*[[Giovanni Battista Rogeri]]\n*[[Francesco Ruggieri]]\n*[[Stefano Scarampella]]\n*[[Antonio Stradivari]]\n*[[David Tecchler]]\n*[[Carlo Giuseppe Testore]]\n*[[Jean Baptiste Vuillaume]]\n\n==Cellists==\n{{Main|List of cellists}}\nA person who plays the cello is called a ''cellist''. For a list of notable cellists, see the [[list of cellists]] and [[:Category:Cellists]].\n\n==Careers==\nCareers in cello vary widely by genre and by region or country. Most cellists earn their living from a mixture of performance and teaching jobs. The first step to getting most performance jobs is by playing at an [[audition]]. In some styles of music, cellists may be asked to [[sight reading|sight read]] printed music or perform standard repertoire with an ensemble.\n\nIn classical music, cellists audition for playing jobs in orchestras and for admission into university or Conservatory programs or degrees. At a classical cello audition, the performer typically plays a movement from a Bach suite or a movement from a concerto and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the [[conductor (music)|conductor]], the [[Concertmaster]], the Principal cellist and other principal players.\n\nThe most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a ''test week'', in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.\n\nPerformance jobs include playing as a freelancer in small groups, playing in a [[chamber music]] group, large ensembles, or performing solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio. Many cello players find extra work by substituting (\"subbing\") for cellists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for many cello players to be able to find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a cellist can come to this is in the case of those who win an audition at a professional orchestra. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral cellists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.\n\nTeaching work for cellists includes giving private lessons in the home or at colleges and universities; coaching cellists who are preparing for recordings or auditions; doing group coaching at music camps or for youth ensembles; and working as a high school music teacher. Due to the limited number of full-time orchestral jobs, many classical cellists are not able to find full-time work with a single orchestra. Some cellists increase their employ-ability by learning several different styles, such as folk or pop.\n\nIn some cases, cellists supplement their performing and teaching income with other related music jobs, such as working as a stringed instrument repairer (luthier); as a contractor who hires musicians for orchestras or big bands, composing music, songwriting, conducting, or organizing festivals (e.g., [[Julian Armour]]).\n\n==Famous instruments==\n{{See also|Category:Individual cellos}}\n[[File:Servais Stradivarius.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The Servais Stradivarius is preserved in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]]]]\nSpecific instruments are famous (or become famous) for a variety of reasons. An instrument's notability may arise from its age, the fame of its maker, its physical appearance, its acoustic properties, and its use by notable performers. The most famous instruments are generally known for all of these things. The most highly prized instruments are now collector's items, and are priced beyond the reach of most musicians. These instruments are typically owned by some kind of organization or investment group, which may loan the instrument to a notable performer.

It is usually accessed by a [[microsequencer]]. Early types of control store took the form of diode-arrays that were accessed via address decoders, but were later implemented as writable microcode that was stored in a form of [[read-only memory]] called a writable control store. The outputs generally had to go through a register to prevent a race condition from occurring. The register was clocked by the clock signal of the system it was running on.\n\n==Implementation==\n\n===Early use===\nEarly control stores were implemented as a diode-array accessed via address decoders, a form of read-only memory. This tradition dates back to the ''program timing matrix'' on the [[MIT Whirlwind]], first described in 1947. Modern [[VLSI]] processors instead use matrices of [[field-effect transistor]]s to build the [[Read-only memory|ROM]] and/or [[programmable logic array|PLA]] structures used to control the processor as well as its internal sequencer in a [[microcode]]d implementation. IBM System/360 used a variety of techniques:  [[CCROS]] (Card Capacitor Read-Only Storage) on the [[IBM System/360 Model 30|Model 30]],  [[TROS]]  (Transformer Read-Only Storage) on the [[IBM System/360 Model 40|Model 40]], and [[BCROS]] (Balanced Capacitor Read-Only Storage) on the [[IBM System/360 Model 50|Model 50]].\n\n===Writable stores===\n\nSome computers were built using \"writable microcode\" \u2014 rather than storing the microcode in ROM or hard-wired logic, the microcode was stored in a RAM called a ''writable control store'' or ''WCS''. Such a computer is sometimes called a ''Writable Instruction Set Computer'' or ''WISC''.<ref>[http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/forth/rochester_87.pdf \"Writable instruction set, stack oriented computers: The WISC Concept\"] article by Philip Koopman Jr. 1987</ref> Many of these machines were experimental laboratory prototypes, such as the WISC CPU/16<ref>[http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/sec4_2.html \"Architecture of the WISC CPU/16\"] by Phil Koopman 1989</ref> and the RTX 32P.<ref>[http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/sec5_3.html \"Architecture of the RTX 32P\"] by Philip Koopman 1989</ref>\n\nThe original [[IBM System/360|System/360]] models of [[IBM mainframe]] had read-only control store, but later System/360, [[IBM System/370|System/370]] and successor models loaded part or all of their microprograms from floppy disks or other DASD into a writable control store consisting of ultra-high speed [[random-access memory|random-access]] [[read-write memory]].

The outputs that go back into the sequencer to determine the next address have to go through some sort of register to prevent the creation of a [[race condition]]. In most designs all of the other bits also go through a register. This is because the machine will work faster if the execution of the next microinstruction is delayed by one cycle. This register is known as a pipeline register. Very often the execution of the next microinstruction is dependent on the result of the current microinstruction, which will not be stable until the end of the current microcycle. It can be seen that either way, all of the outputs of the control store go into one big register. Historically it used to be possible to buy EPROMs with these register bits on the same chip.\n\nThe [[clock signal]] determining the [[clock rate]], which is the cycle time of the system, primarily clocks this register.\n\n== References ==\n{{wikibooks\n |1= Microprocessor Design\n |2= Microcode\n}}\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n<!-- The link is dead and the paper can't be found on the server.\n* {{Cite paper | author=Everett, R.R., and Swain, F.E. | title=Whirlwind I Computer Block Diagrams | publisher=MIT Servomechanisms Laboratory | year=1947 | version=Report R-127 | url=http://www.cs.stthomas.edu/faculty/resmith/papers/WhirlwindR-127.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2006-06-21 }} -->\n* {{cite journal | last=Smith | first=Richard E. | title=A Historical Overview of Computer Architecture | journal=Annals of the History of Computing | year=1988 | volume=10 | issue=4 | pages=277\u2013303 | url=http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MAHC.1988.10039 | doi = 10.1109/MAHC.1988.10039 | accessdate=2006-06-21}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{CPU technologies}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Control Store}}\n[[Category:Instruction processing]]\n[[Category:Firmware]]", "sha1": "25g4yxfv7y7hofc7zgw2nqpeto218lf"}}, {"title": "Columba", "ns": "0", "id": "6561", "revision": {"id": "866318594", "parentid": "866318473", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T17:00:52Z", "contributor": {"username": "CASSIOPEIA", "id": "31051948"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/67.53.166.70|67.53.166.70]] ([[User talk:67.53.166.70|talk]]): unexplained content removal ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{distinguish|text=[[Columbanus]], the Irish missionary monk who founded monasteries in France and Italy}}\n{{other uses|Columba (disambiguation)|Saint Columba (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{Infobox saint\n|name= Saint Columba\n|image=Columba at Bridei's fort.jpg\n|caption=Saint Columba, Apostle to the [[Picts]]\n|titles=Apostle of the [[Picts]]\n|birth_date=7 December 521\n|birth_place=[[Gartan]], [[Ireland]]\n|death_date={{death date and age|df=yes|597|6|9|521|12|7}}\n|death_place=[[Iona]], Scotland\n|feast_day=9 June\n|venerated_in=[[Orthodox Church]]<br />[[Roman Catholic Church]]<br />[[Anglican Communion]]<br />[[Presbyterian Church]]\n|beatified_date=\n|beatified_place=\n|beatified_by=\n|canonized_date=\n|canonized_place=\n|canonized_by=\n|major_shrine=[[Iona]], Scotland\n|attributes=monk's robes, Celtic tonsure and crosier.\n|patronage=[[Derry]], [[floods]], [[bookbinding|bookbinders]], poets, Ireland, Scotland.\n|issues=\n|suppressed_date=\n}}\n'''Saint Columba''' ({{lang-ir|Colm Cille}}, 'church dove';{{Efn | Other names include Irish Gaelic ''Chille'', Scots Gaelic ''Calum Cille'', Manx Gaelic ''Colum Keeilley'', and Old Norse ''Kolban'' or ''Kolbj\u00f8rn''.}}<ref>{{Citation | last = Kenyon | first = Sherrilyn | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=y6mYHORNa5IC&pg=PA358 | title = The Writer's Digest character naming sourcebook | series = Writer's Digest Books | year = 2005 | page = 358}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.keltiskfromhet.no/ressurser/helligsky/pdf-filer/HlSky23_Columba.pdf| publisher = Keltiskfromhet | title = Columba | place = [[Norway|NO]] | language = no}}</ref> {{lang-sco|Columbkille}};{{sfn|Father Colgan|1844|p=11}} 7 December 521 \u2013 9 June 597) was an [[Gaelic Ireland|Irish]] [[abbot]] and missionary Evangelist credited with spreading Christianity in what is today [[Scotland]] at the start of the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]].

On his father's side, he was great-great-grandson of [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]], an [[High King of Ireland|Irish high king]] of the 5th century. He was [[Baptism|baptised]] in Temple-Douglas, in the County Donegal parish of [[Conwal and Leck|Conwal]] (midway between Gartan and [[Letterkenny]]), by his teacher and foster-uncle [[Saint Crunathan]].{{sfn|Reeves|1850|p=82}}{{sfn|Munn|1985|p=}}<ref name=\"Ordnance1986p\">{{Citation | title = Ordnance Survey Memoirs for the Parishes of Desertmartin and Kilcronaghan | publisher = Ballinascreen Historical Society | year = 1986}}.</ref> It is not known for sure if his name at birth was Colmcille or if he adopted this name later in life; [[Adomn\u00e1n]] (Eunan) of Iona thought it was his birth name but other Irish sources have claimed his name at birth was Crimthann (meaning 'fox').{{sfn|Adomnan of Iona|1995|p=}} In the Irish language his name means 'dove', which is the same name as the Prophet Jonah (Jonah in Hebrew is also 'dove'), which Adomn\u00e1n of Iona as well as other early Irish writers were aware of, although it is not clear if he was deliberately named after Jonah or not.\n\n[[File:St Columba's church, Gartan, Donegal.jpg|left|thumb|The remains of St. Columba's Church, [[Gartan]], [[County Donegal]].]]\nWhen sufficiently advanced in letters he entered the monastic school of Movilla, at [[Newtownards]], under St. [[Finnian of Movilla|Finnian]] who had studied at St. [[Ninian]]'s \"Magnum Monasterium\" on the shores of [[Galloway]]. He was about twenty, and a deacon when, having completed his training at Movilla, he travelled southwards into [[Leinster]], where he became a pupil of an aged bard named Gemman. On leaving him, Colmcille entered the monastery of [[Clonard Abbey|Clonard]], governed at that time by [[Finnian of Clonard|Finnian]], noted for sanctity and learning. Here he imbibed the traditions of the Welsh Church, for Finnian had been trained in the schools of [[Saint David|St. David]].<ref name=\"Edmonds\">{{CathEncy|last=Edmonds|first= Columba|title=St. Columba|id=04136a}}</ref>\n\nIn [[History of Ireland (400\u2013800)|early Catholic Ireland]] the [[druid]]ic tradition collapsed due to the spread of the new Roman Catholic faith. The study of [[Latin]] learning and [[Roman Catholic theology]] in [[Monastery|monasteries]] flourished. Colmcille became a pupil at the monastic school at [[Clonard Abbey]], situated on the [[River Boyne]] in modern [[County Meath]]. During the sixth century, some of the most significant names in the history of Irish Catholicism studied at the Clonard monastery. It is said that the average number of scholars under instruction at Clonard was 3,000.<ref name=\"Gratton-Flood1\" /> Colmcille was one of twelve students of [[Finnian of Clonard|St. Finnian]] who became known as the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]]. He became a monk and eventually was [[Ordination|ordained]] a [[Presbyter|priest]].\n\nAnother preceptor of Colmcille was [[Mobh\u00ed Cl\u00e1rainech|St. Mobhi]], whose monastery at [[Glasnevin]] was frequented by such famous men as [[St. Canice]], [[St. Comgall]], and [[St. Ciar\u00e1n]]. A pestilence which devastated Ireland in 544 caused the dispersion of Mobhi's disciples, and Colmcille returned to [[Ulster]], the land of his kindred. He was a striking figure of great stature and powerful build, with a loud, melodious voice which could be heard from one hilltop to another.<ref name= crawley>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/COLUMBA.htm |chapter=Saint Columba, Abbot and Confessor\u2014521-597 |last=Crawley |first=John J |title=Lives of the Saints |publisher=John J.

Thence he brought a copy of those gospels that had lain on the bosom of St. Martin for the space of 100 years. This relic was deposited in Derry.<ref name=\"Edmonds\" />\n\nTradition asserts that, sometime around 560, he became involved in a quarrel with [[Finnian of Moville|Saint Finnian]] of [[Movilla Abbey]] over a [[psalter]].  Colmcille copied the manuscript at the [[scriptorium]] under Saint Finnian, intending to keep the copy. Saint Finnian disputed his right to keep the copy. The dispute eventually led to the pitched [[Battle of C\u00fal Dreimhne]] in [[Cairbre Drom Cliabh]] (now in [[County Sligo]]) in 561, during which many men were killed. A second grievance that led him to induce the clan Neill to rise and engage in battle against King Diarmait at Cooldrevny in 561 was the king's violation of the right of sanctuary belonging to Colmcille's person as a monk on the occasion of the murder of Prince Curnan, the saint's kinsman.<ref name=\"Edmonds\" /> Prince Curnan of Connaught, who had fatally injured a rival in a hurling match and had taken refuge with Colmcille, was dragged from his protector's arms and slain by Diarmaid's men, in defiance of the rights of sanctuary.<ref name=crawley/>\n\nA [[synod]] of [[clerics]] and scholars threatened to [[Excommunication|excommunicate]] him for these deaths, but St. [[Brendan of Birr]] spoke on his behalf with the result that he was allowed to go into exile instead. Colmcille's own conscience was uneasy, and on the advice of an aged hermit, Molaise, he resolved to expiate his offence by going into exile and win for Christ as many souls as had perished in the terrible battle of C\u00fal Dreimhne. He left Ireland, to return only once, many years later. Colmcille's copy of the [[psalter]] has been traditionally associated with the [[Cathach of St. Columba|Cathach of St. Colmcille]].\n\n==Scotland==\nIn 563, he travelled to [[Scotland]] with twelve companions (said to include [[Odran of Iona]]) in a wicker [[currach]] covered with leather. According to legend he first landed on the [[Mull of Kintyre|Kintyre]] Peninsula, near [[Southend, Kintyre|Southend]]. However, being still in sight of his native land, he moved farther north up the west coast of Scotland. The island of [[Iona]] was made over to him by his kinsman [[Conall mac Comgaill]] [[List of kings of D\u00e1l Riata|King of D\u00e1l Riata]],  who perhaps had invited him to come to Scotland in the first place.<ref name=crawley/> However, there is a sense in which he was not leaving his native people, as the Ulster [[Gaels]] had been colonising the west coast of Scotland for the previous couple of centuries.{{sfn|Fletcher|1989|pp=23-24}} Aside from the services he provided guiding the only centre of [[literacy]] in the region, his reputation as a holy man led to his role as a diplomat among the tribes.<ref>[http://www.stcolumbaretreathouse.com/saint_columba.htm \"Who is St. Columba?\"] St. Columba Retreat House. Retrieved 6 October 2008.</ref> There are also many stories of miracles which he performed during his work to [[religious conversion|convert]] the Picts, the most famous being his encounter with an unidentified animal that some have equated with the [[Loch Ness Monster]] in 565. It is said that he banished a ferocious \"water beast\" to the depths of the [[River Ness]] after it had killed a Pict and then tried to attack Colmcille's disciple named Lugne (see Vita Columbae Book 2 below). He visited the [[Paganism|pagan]] King [[Bridei I of the Picts|Bridei]], King of [[Fortriu]], at his base in [[Inverness]], winning Bridei's respect, although not his conversion.  He subsequently played a major role in the politics of the country.  He was also very energetic in his work as a missionary, and, in addition to founding several churches in the [[Hebrides]], he worked to turn his monastery at Iona into a school for missionaries.  He was a renowned [[man of letters]], having written several [[hymns]] and being credited with having [[Calligraphy|transcribe]]d 300 books.  One of the few, if not the only, times he left Scotland was towards the end of his life, when he returned to Ireland to found the [[Durrow Abbey|monastery]] at [[Durrow, County Offaly|Durrow]].\n\nColmcille died on Iona and was buried in 597 by his [[monk]]s in the [[abbey]] he created. In 794 the Vikings descended on Iona. Colmcille's relics were finally removed in 849 and divided between Scotland and Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/columba/ |title=Scotland's History \u2013 Columba |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> The parts of the relics which went to Ireland are reputed to be buried in [[Downpatrick]], [[County Down]], with [[St. Patrick]] and [[St. Brigid]] or at Saul Church neighbouring Downpatrick.

The name of the city in [[Irish Gaelic|Irish]] is ''Doire Colmcille'' and is derived from the native oak trees in the area and the city's association with Colmcille. The Catholic Church of Saint Colmcille's Long Tower, and the Church of Ireland St Augustine's Church both claim to stand at the spot of this original settlement. The [[Church of Ireland]] Cathedral in Derry is dedicated to St Colmcille.\n\nSt. Columba's Primary School in Drumcondra is a girl's school named after the saint.\n \nSt. Colmcilles Primary School<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stcolmcilles.org/ |title= St Colmcilles |accessdate= 12 May 2014}}</ref> and St. Colmcilles Community School<ref>{{cite web| title =St. Colmcille\u2019s Community School |url=http://www.stcolmcilles.ie/ |date= 8 May 2014 |accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref> are two schools in [[Knocklyon]], Dublin, named after St. Colmcille, with the former having an annual day dedicated to the saint on 9 June.\n\nThe town of [[Swords, Dublin]] was reputedly founded by Saint Colmcille in 560 AD.<ref>Sidwell, Keith (1995), Reading Medieval Latin, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 70, {{ISBN|0-521-44747-X}}</ref> St Colmcille\u2019s Boys\u2019 National School and St. Colmcille\u2019s Girls\u2019 National School, both located in the town of Swords, are also named after the saint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stcolmcillesgns.scoilnet.ie/blog/|title=St. Colmcille's Girls' N.S. - F\u00e1ilte chuig su\u00edomh idirl\u00edon Scoil Cholmcille na gCail\u00edn\u00ed|website=stcolmcillesgns.scoilnet.ie}}</ref>\n\n[http://www.columba.ie/ The Columba Press], a religious and spiritual book company based in Dublin, is named after St. Colmcille.\n\n[[Aer Lingus]], Ireland's national [[flag carrier]] has named one of its [[Airbus A330]] aircraft in commemoration of the saint (reg: EI-DUO).\n\n===Scotland===\nColmcille is credited as being a leading figure in the revitalisation of [[monasticism]]. The [[Clan MacCallum|Clan Malcolm/Clan McCallum]] claims its name from Colmcille and was reputedly founded by the descendants of his original followers. It is also said that [[Clan Robertson]] Clan Donnachaidh / Duncan are heirs of Colmcille. [[Clan MacKinnon]] may also have some claim to being spiritual descendants of St Colmcille as after he founded his monastery on Isle [[Iona]], the MacKinnons were the [[abbot]]s of the Church for centuries.  This would also account for the fact that Clan MacKinnon is amongst the ancient clans of Scotland.{{sfn|Dowley|1977|p=}}\n\nThe cathedral of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles|Diocese of Argyll and the Isles]] is placed under the patronage of St. Colmcille, as are numerous [[Catholic school]]s and parishes throughout the nation.

[[Stained glass]] window in [[Iona Abbey]]]]\n\nThe main source of information about Saint Colmcille's life is the Vita Columbae (i.e. \"Life of Colmcille\"), a hagiography written in the style of \"saint's lives\" narratives that had become widespread throughout medieval Europe. Compiled and drafted by scribes and clergymen, these accounts were written in Latin and served as written collections of the deeds and miracles attributed to the saint, both during his or her life or after death. The canonization of a saint, especially one who had lived on the fringes of the medieval Catholic world like Saint Colmcille, required a well-written hagiography to be submitted to Rome, but popular belief and local cults of sainthood often led to the veneration of these men and women without official approval from the Catholic Church.\n\nWriting a century after the death of Saint Colmcille, the author [[Adomn\u00e1n]] (also known as Eunan), served as the ninth Abbot of Iona until his death in 704.<ref name=\"Gratton-Flood2\">{{CathEncy|first=W.H. |last=Gratton-Flood |title= St. Adamnan|id=01135c}}</ref> James Earle Fraser asserts that Adomn\u00e1n drew extensively from an existing body of accounts regarding the life of Saint Colmcille, including a Latin collection entitled \"De uirtutibus sancti Columbae\", composed c. 640 A.D. This earlier work is attributed to Cummene Find, who became the abbot of Iona and served as the leader of the monastic island community from 656 until his death in 668 A.D. or 669 A.D.{{sfn|Fraser|2009|p=98}}\n\nWhile the Vita Columbae often conflicts with contemporaneous accounts of various battles, figures, and dates, it remains the most important surviving work from early medieval Scotland and provides a wealth of knowledge regarding the Picts and other ethnic and political groups from this time period. The Vita also offers a valuable insight into the monastic practices of Iona and the daily life of the early medieval Gaelic monks.\n\nThe surviving manuscripts include:\n\n* Generalia 1 (A), Stadtbibliothek Schaffhausen, Switzerland; vellum, probably written before 713\n* British Library MS Add. 35110 (B1), folios 96v-143r, probably written before 1165.\n* British Library MS Cottonian Tiberius D III (B2), folios 192r-217r, written end of 12th to early 13th century. Due to fire damage in 1731, there are missing illegible portions on every page, and six folios [Book I, ch. 2 (diebus) to 22 (genibus) and 36 (viro) to 49 (omnia quae)] are missing completely.\n* British Library MS Royal 8 D IX (B3), folios 1r-70r, written in the fifteenth or early sixteenth century. The first 8 folios, [to I, 3 (haec puro pectore)] are missing.<ref name=\"Ucc.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T201040/index.html |title=Life of St. Columba |publisher=Ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nInstead of relying on chronological order, Adomn\u00e1n categorises the events recorded in the ''Vita Columbae'' into three different books: Columba\u2019s Prophecies, Columba\u2019s Miracles, and Columba\u2019s Apparitions.<ref name=\"Ucc.ie\" />\n\n===Book one (Of his Prophetic Revelations)===\n\nIn the first book, the author Adomn\u00e1n lists Saint Colmcille's prophetic revelations, which come as a result of the saint's ability to view the present and the future simultaneously. Most of the short chapters begin with Saint Colmcille informing his fellow monks that a person will soon arrive on the island or an event will imminently occur.\n\nIn one notable instance, Colmcille appears in a dream to King Oswald of Northumbria, and announces the king's incoming victory against the King Catlon (Cadwallon of Wales) in the Battle of Heavenfield. The people of Britain promise to convert to Catholicism and receive baptism after the conclusion of the war. This victory signals the re-Catholicizing of pagan England, and establishes King Oswald as ruler of the entirety of Britain.\n\nColmcille's other prophecies can be considered vindictive at times, as when he sends a man named Batain off to perform his penance, but then Colmcille turns to his friends and says Batain will instead return to Scotia and be killed by his enemies. Several of Saint Colmcille's prophecies reflect the scribal culture in which he was immersed, such his miraculous knowledge of the missing letter \"I\u201d from Baithene's psalter or when he prophecies that an eager man will knock over his inkhorn and spill its contents.{{sfn|Adomnan of Iona|1995|loc=Book one, Chapter 17}}\n\n=== Book two (Of his Miraculous Powers) ===\n\nIn the second book, Colmcille performs various miracles such as healing people with diseases, expelling malignant spirits, subduing wild beasts, calming storms, and even returning the dead to life. They have also made many schools in honour of St.Colmcille, one was founded by the Sisters of Charity.\n\nHe also performs agricultural miracles that would hold a special significance to the common people of Ireland and the Britain such as when he casts a demon out of a pail and restores the spilt milk to its container.\n\nThe Vita contains a story that has been interpreted as the first reference to the Loch Ness Monster. According to Adomn\u00e1n, Colmcille came across a group of Picts burying a man who had been killed by the monster. Colmcille saves a swimmer from the monster with the sign of the Cross and the imprecation, \"Thou shalt go no further, nor touch the man; go back with all speed.\" The beast flees, terrified, to the amazement of the assembled Picts who glorified Colmcille's God. Whether or not this incident is true, Adomnan's text specifically states that the monster was swimming in the River Ness \u2013 the river flowing from the loch \u2013 rather than in Loch Ness itself.{{sfn|Adomnan of Iona|1995|loc=Book two, Chapter 28}}\n\n=== Book three (The Apparitions of Angels) ===\n\nIn book three, Adomn\u00e1n describes different apparitions of the Saint, both that Colmcille receives and those that are seen by others regarding him. He mentions that, \"For indeed after the lapse of many years, ... St. Colmcille was excommunicated by a certain synod for some pardonable and very trifling reasons, and indeed unjustly\" (P.79- 80).\n\nIn one of the accounts, Saint Colmcille, in this period of excommunication, goes to a meeting held against him in Teilte. Saint Brend\u00e1n, despite of all the negative reactions among the seniors toward Colmcille, kisses him reverently and assures that Colmcille is the man of God and that he sees Holy Angels accompanying Colmcille on his journey through the plain.{{sfn|Adomnan of Iona|1995|loc=Book three, Chapter 3}}\n\nIn the last Chapter, Colmcille foresees his own death when speaking to his attendant: <blockquote>This day in the Holy Scriptures is called the Sabbath, which means rest. And this day is indeed a Sabbath to me, for it is the last day of my present laborious life, and on it I rest after the fatigues of my labours; and this night at midnight, which commenceth the solemn Lord's Day, I shall, according to the sayings of Scripture, go the way of our fathers. For already my Lord Jesus Christ deigneth to invite me; and to Him, I say, in the middle of this night shall I depart, at His invitation. For so it hath been revealed to me by the Lord himself. </blockquote>\n\nAnd when the bell strikes midnight, Colmcille goes to the church and kneels beside the altar. His attendant witnesses heavenly light in the direction of Colmcille, and Holy angels join the saint in his passage to the Lord: <blockquote>And having given them his holy benediction in this way, he immediately breathed his last. After his soul had left the tabernacle of the body, his face still continued ruddy, and brightened in a wonderful way by his vision of the angels, and that to such a degree that he had the appearance, not so much of one dead, as of one alive and sleeping.{{sfn|Adomnan of Iona|1995|loc=Book three, Chapter 23}} </blockquote>\n\n==Other early sources of Colmcille's life==\nBoth the ''Vita Columbae'' and the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]] (672/673-735) record Colmcille's visit to [[Bridei I of the Picts|Bridei]]. Whereas Adomn\u00e1n just tells us that Colmcille visited Bridei, Bede relates a later, perhaps Pictish tradition, whereby the saint actually converts the Pictish king. Another early source is a poem in praise of Colmcille, most probably commissioned by Colmcille's kinsman, the King of the [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]] clan. It was almost certainly written within three or four years of Colmcille's death and is the earliest vernacular poem in European history. It consists of 25 [[stanza]]s of four verses of seven syllables each, called the [[Amra]] Coluim Chille.\n\nThrough the reputation of its venerable founder and its position as a major European centre of learning, Colmcille's Iona became a place of [[pilgrimage]]. Colmcille is historically revered as a warrior saint, and was often invoked for victory in battle.\nHis relics were finally removed in 849 and divided between [[Alba]] and Ireland. Relics of Colmcille were carried before Scottish armies in the reliquary made at Iona in the mid-8th century, called the Brecbennoch. Legend has it that the Brecbennoch was carried to the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] (24 June 1314) by the vastly outnumbered Scots army and the intercession of Colmcille helped them to victory. Since the 19th century the \"Brecbennoch of St. Columba\" has been identified with the [[Monymusk Reliquary]], although this is now doubted by scholars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://local.nationalmusuems/explore-our-collections/stories/scottish-history-and-archaeology/monymusk-reliquary/|title=Monymusk reliquary|first1=Scottish|last1=History|first2=Archaeology 5 min|last2=read|website=National Museums Scotland}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Antiphoner]] of [[Inchcolm Abbey]], the \"Iona of the East\" (situated on an island in the [[Firth of Forth]]), a 14th-century prayer begins ''O Columba spes Scotorum...'' \"O Columbus, hope of the Scots\".{{sfn|Gillespie|2016|p=133}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Columba College]]\n*[[Irish Golden Age|Early Christian Ireland]]\n*[[Celtic Christianity]]\n*[[List of people on stamps of Ireland]]\n*[[Old High St Stephen's, Inverness]]\n*[[Sainte-Colombe (disambiguation)|Sainte-Colombe]]\n*[[Scoil Colmcille, Letterkenny|Scoil Colmcille]]\n*[[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages]]\n*[[St. Columba's School (disambiguation)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Reeves|first=William|title=Acts of Archbishop Colton in His Metropolitan Visitation of the Diocese of Derry, A.D. 1397; With a Rental of the See Estates at that Time; Edited, from the Original Roll Preserved in the Archiepiscopal Record Closet of Armagh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qa1jAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA82|year=1850|publisher=Irish Archaeological Society}}\n*{{Citation|last=Adomn\u00e1n |author-link=Adomn\u00e1n | origyear =c. 700|editor-last=Reeves |editor-first=William|title=Life of Saint Columba, Founder of Hy\n|publisher=Edmonston and Douglas|publication-date=1874|publication-place=Edinburgh|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T201040/|accessdate=14 September 2008}}\n* Anderson, Alan Orr and Anderson, Marjorie Ogilvie, eds.

Thus, the goal of a conditional proof is to demonstrate that if the CPA were true, then the desired conclusion [[Logical consequence|necessarily follows]]. The validity of a conditional proof does not require that the CPA be actually true, only that ''if it were true'' it would lead to the consequent.\n\nConditional proofs are of great importance in [[mathematics]]. Conditional proofs exist linking several otherwise unproven [[conjecture]]s, so that a proof of one conjecture may immediately imply the validity of several others. It can be much easier to show a proposition's truth to follow from another proposition than to prove it independently.\n\nA famous network of conditional proofs is the [[NP-complete]] class of complexity theory.  There are a [[List of NP-complete problems|large number]] of interesting tasks, and while it is not known if a polynomial-time solution exists for any of them, it is known that if such a solution exists for any of them, one exists for all of them. Similarly, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] has a large number of consequences already proven.\n\n== Symbolic logic ==\nAs an example of a conditional proof in [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], suppose we want to prove A \u2192 C (if A, then C) from the first two premises below:\n\n{|\n|-\n|align=right| 1. || A \u2192 B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; || (\"If A, then B\")\n|-\n|align=right| 2. || B \u2192 C || (\"If B, then C\")\n|-\n|colspan=3| <hr>\n|-\n|align=right| 3. || A ||(conditional proof assumption, \"Suppose A is true\")\n|-\n|align=right| 4. || B || (follows from lines 1 and 3, [[modus ponens]]; \"If A then B; A, therefore B\")\n|-\n|align=right| 5. || C || (follows from lines 2 and 4, [[modus ponens]]; \"If B then C; B, therefore C\")\n|-\n|align=right| 6. || A \u2192 C || (follows from lines 3\u20135, conditional proof; \"If A, then C\")\n|}\n\n==See also== \n* [[Deduction theorem]]\n* [[Logical consequence]]\n* [[Propositional calculus]]\n\n== References ==\n* Robert L.

English is spoken as a first or second language in most of the Commonwealth. In a few countries, such as [[Languages of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and [[Languages of Malaysia|Malaysia]], it does not have [[official language|official status]], but is widely used as a [[lingua franca]]. [[Mozambique]] is an exception \u2013 although English is widely spoken there, it is a former Portuguese colony which joined the Commonwealth in 1996.\n\nMany regions, notably [[Canadian English|Canada]], [[Australian English|Australia]], [[Indian English|India]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], [[Pakistani English|Pakistan]], [[South African English|South Africa]], [[Hong Kong English|Hong Kong]], [[Malaysian English|Malaysia]], [[Brunei English|Brunei]], [[Singapore English|Singapore]], [[Sri Lankan English|Sri Lanka]] and the [[Caribbean English|Caribbean]], have developed their own native varieties of the language.\n\nWritten English as used in the Commonwealth generally favours British spelling as opposed to American spelling, with some exceptions in Canada, where there is also a strong influence from neighbouring [[American English]] ([[North American English]]).\n\nThe report of the Inter-Governmental Group on Criteria for Commonwealth Membership states that English is a symbol of Commonwealth heritage and unity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/history-of-the-commonwealth/new-criteria-commonwealth-membership|title=New criteria for Commonwealth membership {{!}} The Commonwealth|last=(http://www.hydrant.co.uk)|first=Site designed and built by Hydrant|website=thecommonwealth.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n== Native varieties ==\n[[Southern Hemisphere]] native varieties of English began to develop during the 18th century, with the colonisation of Australasia and South Africa. [[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]] are closely related to each other, and share some similarities with [[South African English]]. The vocabularies of these dialects draw from both [[British English|British]] and [[American English]] as well as numerous native peculiarities.\n\n[[Canadian English]] is the variety of English spoken in Canada. It contains elements of British English and American English, as well as many Canadianisms. It is the product of several waves of immigration and settlement, from the United States, Britain, Ireland, and around the world, over a period of almost two centuries. Modern Canadian English has taken significant vocabulary and spelling from the shared political and social institutions of Commonwealth countries.\n\n=== The Caribbean ===\n[[Caribbean English]] is influenced by the English-based [[Creole language|Creole]] varieties spoken, but they are not one and the same. There is a great deal of variation in the way English is spoken, with a \"Standard English\" at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum and Creole languages at the other. These dialects have roots in 17th-century English and [[African language]]s; unlike most native varieties of English, West Indian dialects often tend to be syllable-timed rather than [[Timing (linguistics)|stress-timed]].\n\n== Non-native varieties ==\n\nSecond language varieties of English in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] have often undergone \"indigenisation\"; that is, each English-speaking community has developed (or is in the process of developing) its own standards of usage, often under the influence of local languages. These dialects are sometimes referred to as ''New Englishes'' (McArthur, p.&nbsp;36); most of them inherited [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]] from Southern British English.\n\n=== Africa ===\nSeveral dialects of [[West African English]] exist, with a lot of regional variation and some influence from indigenous languages. West African English tends to be [[Isochrony|syllable-timed]], and its phoneme inventory is much simpler than that of [[Received Pronunciation]]; this sometimes affects mutual intelligibility with native varieties of English. A distinctive [[East African English]] is spoken in countries such as [[Kenya]] or [[Tanzania]].\n\nSmall communities of native English speakers can be found in [[Zimbabwe]], [[Botswana]] and [[Namibia]]; the dialects spoken are similar to [[South African English]].\n\nIn countries such as [[Kenya]] - particularly in Nairobi and other cities where there is an expanding middle class - English is increasingly being used in the home as the first language, albeit often with significant influences from Bantu languages such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]].\n\n=== Asia ===\n[[India]] has the largest English-speaking population in the Commonwealth, although comparatively few speakers of [[Indian English]] are first language speakers (indeed, the same is true of English spoken in other parts of South Asia e.g. [[Pakistani English]], [[Bangladeshi English]]). [[South Asia]]n English phonology is highly variable; stress, rhythm and intonation are generally different from those of native varieties. There are also several peculiarities at the levels of morphology, syntax and usage, some of which can also be found among educated speakers.\n\n[[Southeast Asian English]] comprises [[Singapore English]], [[Malaysian English]] and [[Brunei English]]; it features some influence from [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] languages, as well as [[Indian English]].\n\n[[Hong Kong]] ceased to be part of the Commonwealth in 1997. Nonetheless, the English language still enjoys status as an official language, alongside Chinese (See [[Hong Kong English]]).\n\n==See also==\n* [[British English]]\n* [[North American English]]\n* [[EF English Proficiency Index]]\n* [[English-speaking world]]\n\n'''Other languages:'''\n* [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]]\n* [[Dutch Language Union|Dutch Union]]\n* [[Francophonie|La Francophonie]]\n* [[Latin Union]]\n* [[List of countries by spoken languages]]\n\n== References ==\n* McArthur, Tom (2002).

After correcting the manuscript, I burned it.\nWhat I kept for my own use was the atmosphere of secret life: How it worked on the five senses and what it did to the heart and mind. All the rest went up in flames, setting me free henceforth to make it all up. In all important matters, such as the creation of characters and the invention of plots, with rare and minor exceptions, that is what I have done. And, as might be expected, when I have been weak enough to use something that really happened as an episode in a novel, it is that piece of scrap, buried in a landfill of the imaginary, readers invariably refuse to believe.\"<ref name=\"Charles McCarry 1994\">McCarry, Charles, \"Between the Real and the Believable,\" ''Washington Post'', December 11, 1994.</ref>\n\nThroughout McCarry's fiction are statements and descriptions such as \"the average intelligence officer is a sort of latter-day Marcel Proust.

But since no one can claim to have read every America espionage novel ever written, let\u2019s just say that ''The Tears of Autumn'' is a perfect spy novel, and that its hero, Paul Christopher, should by all rights be known the world over as the thinking man\u2019s James Bond \u2014 and woman\u2019s too.\"\u2014Brendan Bernard, \"The Great American Spy Novel,\" March 31, 2005', LA Weekly''<ref name=\"laweekly.com\"/>\n\n\"''Old Boys'' is a large yarn that will make yummy reading between long looks at Nantucket Sound this summer. (And a boffo movie in the right hands.) But it is a tale that travels from the outlandish to the absurd. As long as readers don't expect the taut realism we have come to expect from the man, they'll be fine. If they're looking for vintage McCarry, though, this will produce unhappy campers. The book does not approach his better grownup fiction. It is not in the same league, for example, with ''The Miernik Dossier'', the small gem that made McCarry's career. Rather, it is something of a \"Treasure Island\" for lovers of spook fiction, a near-juvenile adventure that entrances adults who know better with fabulous writing. What they do get is a fleeting reprise of McCarry's great creation, Paul Christopher. Christopher, the spy whom many first met in McCarry's bestseller ''The Tears of Autumn'', is now an opaque older man and an ascetic survivor of a Chinese prison camp.\"--Sam Allis, \"McCarry's thriller 'Old Boys' is a trip past believable,\" Boston ''Globe'', July 26, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2004/07/26/mccarrys_thriller_old_boys_is_a_trip_past_believable/|title=McCarry's thriller 'Old Boys' is a trip past believable - The Boston Globe|website=archive.boston.com}}</ref>\n\n==McCarry and the JFK assassination in real life and in his fiction==\n--\"...the most credible account of President Kennedy\u2019s assassination.

According to the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res gestae]]'' (ch. 26) of [[Augustus]], the Cimbri were still found in the area around the turn of the 1st century AD:\n\n{{quote|My fleet sailed from the mouth of the Rhine eastward as far as the lands of the Cimbri, to which, up to that time, no Roman had ever penetrated either by land or by sea, and the Cimbri and [[Charudes|Charydes]] and [[Semnones]] and other peoples of the Germans of that same region through their envoys sought my friendship and that of the Roman people.}}\n\nThe contemporary Greek geographer [[Strabo]] testifies that the Cimbri still existed as a Germanic tribe, presumably in the \"Cimbric peninsula\" (since they are said to live by the [[North Sea]] and to have paid tribute to Augustus):\n\n{{quote|As for the Cimbri, some things that are told about them are incorrect and others are extremely improbable. For instance, one could not accept such a reason for their having become a wandering and piratical folk as this that while they were dwelling on a Peninsula they were driven out of their habitations by a great flood-tide; for in fact they still hold the country which they held in earlier times; and they sent as a present to Augustus the most sacred kettle in their country, with a plea for his friendship and for an amnesty of their earlier offences, and when their petition was granted they set sail for home; and it is ridiculous to suppose that they departed from their homes because they were incensed on account of a phenomenon that is natural and eternal, occurring twice every day.

After several unsuccessful battles with the [[Boii]] and other [[Celtic tribes]], they appeared ca 113 BC in [[Noricum]], where they invaded the lands of one of Rome's allies, the [[Taurisci]].\n\nOn the request of the Roman [[consul]] [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo (consul 113 BC)|Gnaeus Papirius Carbo]], sent to defend the Taurisci, they retreated, only to find themselves deceived and attacked at the [[Battle of Noreia]], where they defeated the Romans.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cimbri|volume=6|page=368|first=Frederick George Meeson |last=Beck}}</ref> Only a storm, which separated the combatants, saved the Roman forces from complete annihilation.\n\n===Invading Gaul===\nNow the road to Italy was open, but they turned west towards [[Gaul]]. They came into frequent conflict with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], who usually came out the losers. In [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]] the Aduaticii\u2014Belgians of Cimbrian origin\u2014repeatedly sided with Rome's enemies. In 109 BC, they defeated a Roman army under the consul [[Marcus Junius Silanus (consul 109 BC)|Marcus Junius Silanus]], who was the commander of [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. In 107 BC they defeated another Roman army under the consul [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Gaius Cassius Longinus]], who was killed at the [[Battle of Burdigala]] (modern day [[Bordeaux]]) against the [[Tigurini]], who were allies of the Cimbri.\n\n===Attacking the Roman Republic===\nIt was not until 105 BC that they planned an attack on the Roman Republic itself. At the [[Rh\u00f4ne]], the Cimbri clashed with the Roman armies.  Discord between the Roman commanders, the proconsul [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]] and the consul [[Gnaeus Mallius Maximus]], hindered Roman coordination and so the Cimbri succeeded in first defeating the legate [[Marcus Aurelius Scaurus]] and later inflicted a devastating defeat on Caepio and Maximus at the [[Battle of Arausio]]. The Romans lost as many as 80,000 men, according to [[Livy]], [[Mommsen]] thought that excluded auxiliary cavalry and non-combatants who brought the total loss closer to 112,000. Other estimates are much smaller, but by any account a large Roman army was routed.\n\nRome was in panic, and the ''terror cimbricus'' became proverbial. Everyone expected to soon see the ''new Gauls'' outside of the gates of Rome. Desperate measures were taken: contrary to the Roman constitution, [[Gaius Marius]], who had defeated [[Jugurtha]], was elected consul and supreme commander for five years in a row (104\u2013100 BC).\n\n===Defeat===\n[[File:The defeat of the Cimbri.jpg|right|thumb|''The Defeat of the Cimbri'' by [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps|Alexandre-Gabriel D\u00e9camps]]]]\nIn 104\u2013103 BC, the Cimbri had turned to the Iberian Peninsula where they pillaged far and wide, until they were confronted by a coalition of [[Celtiberians]].<ref>Livy: Periochae 67</ref> Defeated, the Cimbri returned to Gaul, where they joined their allies, the [[Teutons]]. During this time C. Marius had the time to prepare and, in 102 BC, he was ready to meet the Teutons and the Ambrones at the Rh\u00f4ne. These two tribes intended to pass into Italy through the western passes, while the Cimbri and the Tigurines were to take the northern route across the [[Rhine]] and later across the [[Central Eastern Alps]].\n\nAt the estuary of the [[Is\u00e8re (river)|Is\u00e8re]], the Teutons and the Ambrones met Marius, whose well-defended camp they did not manage to overrun. Instead, they pursued their route, and Marius followed them.  At [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae|Aquae Sextiae]], the Romans won two battles and took the Teuton king [[Teutobod]] prisoner.\n\nThe Cimbri had penetrated through the Alps into northern Italy. The consul [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus]] had not dared to fortify the passes, but instead he had retreated behind the river [[Po (river)|Po]], and so the land was open to the invaders. The Cimbri did not hurry, and the victors of Aquae Sextiae had the time to arrive with reinforcements. At the [[Battle of Vercellae]], at the confluence of the river [[Sesia]] with the [[Po (river)|Po]], in 101 BC, the long voyage of the Cimbri also came to an end.\n\nIt was a devastating defeat, two chieftains, [[Lugius]] and [[Boiorix]], died on the field, while the other chieftains [[Caesorix]] and [[Claodicus]] were captured.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sampson |first=Gareth S. |authorlink= |title=The crisis of Rome: the Jugurthine and Northern Wars and the rise of Marius |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUQpAQAAMAAJ&q=%22The+kings+Lugius+and+Boiorix+fell+on+the+battlefield;+Claodicus+and+Caesorix+were+captured%22&dq=%22The+kings+Lugius+and+Boiorix+fell+on+the+battlefield;+Claodicus+and+Caesorix+were+captured%22&hl=no&sa=X&ei=1DG6UP-DBcvU4QSZloCICQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA |accessdate=1 December 2012 |year=2010 |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |location= |isbn= |page=175 |pages=}}</ref> The women killed both themselves and their children in order to avoid slavery.

Edwards). They founded the city of Atuatuca in the land of the [[Belgae|Belgic]] [[Eburones]], whom they dominated. Thus [[Ambiorix]] king of the Eburones paid tribute and gave his son and nephew as hostages to the Atuatuci (''Gall.'' 6.27). In the first century AD, the Eburones were replaced or absorbed by the Germanic [[Tungri]], and the city was known as Atuatuca Tungrorum, i.e. the modern city of [[Tongeren]].\n\nThe population of modern-day [[Himmerland]] claims to be the heirs of the ancient Cimbri.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The adventures of the Cimbri are described by the Danish Nobel Prize\u2013winning author [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen|Johannes V. Jensen]], himself born in Himmerland, in the novel ''Cimbrernes Tog'' (1922), included in the epic cycle ''Den lange Rejse'' (English ''[[The Long Journey]]'', 1923). The so-called Cimbrian bull (\"[[Cimbrian Bull|Cimbrertyren]]\"), a sculpture by [[Anders Bundgaard]], was erected on 14 April 1937 in a central town square in [[Aalborg]], the capital of the [[Region Nordjylland|region of North Jutland]].\n\nA German ethnic minority speaking the [[Cimbrian language]], having settled in the mountains between Vicenza, Verona, and Trento in Italy (also known as [[Seven Communities]]), is also called the [[:it:Cimbri (minoranza linguistica)|''Cimbri'']]. For hundreds of years this isolated population and its present 4,400 inhabitants have claimed to be the direct descendants of the Cimbri retreating to this area after the Roman victory over their tribe. However, it is more likely that Bavarians settled here in the Middle Ages. Most linguists remain committed to the hypothesis of a medieval (11th to 12th century AD) immigration to explain the presence of small German-speaking communities in the north of Italy.<ref>James R.

On the other hand, the original place names in the region, from the specifically localized language known as 'Cimbro' are still in use alongside the more modern names today. These indicate a different origin (e.g., Asiago is known also by its original Cimbro name of ''Sleghe''). The Cimbrian origin myth was popularized by humanists in the 14th century.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nDespite these connections to southern Germany, belief in a Himmerland origin persisted well into modern times.  On one occasion in 1709, for instance, [[Frederick IV of Denmark]] paid the region's inhabitants a visit and was greeted as their king. The population, which kept its independence during the time of the Venice Republic, was later severely devastated by [[World War I]]. As a result, many Cimbri have left this mountainous region of Italy, effectively forming a worldwide diaspora.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Religion===\n[[File:Gundestrup E.jpg|thumb|Three [[carnyx]] players are depicted at right on plate E of the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].]]\n\nStrabo gives this vivid description of the Cimbric folklore (''Geogr.'' 7.2.3, trans. H.L. Jones):\n\n(The priestess mentioned below was called, in Danish: en V\u00f8lve (a voelve)).\n\n{{quote|Their wives, who would accompany them on their expeditions, were attended by priestesses who were seers; these were grey-haired, clad in white, with flaxen cloaks fastened on with clasps, girt with girdles of bronze, and bare-footed; now sword in hand these priestesses would meet with the prisoners of war throughout the camp, and having first crowned them with wreaths would lead them to a brazen vessel of about twenty amphorae; and they had a raised platform which the priestess would mount, and then, bending over the kettle, would cut the throat of each prisoner after he had been lifted up; and from the blood that poured forth into the vessel some of the priestesses would draw a prophecy, while still others would split open the body and from an inspection of the entrails would utter a prophecy of victory for their own people; and during the battles they would beat on the hides that were stretched over the wicker-bodies of the wagons and in this way produce an unearthly noise.}}\n\nThe Cimbri are depicted as ferocious warriors who did not fear death. The host was followed by women and children on carts. Aged women, [[priest]]esses, dressed in white sacrificed the prisoners of war and sprinkled their blood, the nature of which allowed them to see what was to come.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nIf the Cimbri did in fact come from Jutland, evidence that they practised ritualistic sacrifice may be found in the [[Haraldsk\u00e6r Woman]] discovered in Jutland in the year 1835.  Noosemarks and skin piercing were evident and she had been thrown into a bog rather than buried or cremated. Furthermore, the [[Gundestrup cauldron]], found in Himmerland, may be a sacrificial vessel like the one described in Strabo's text. The work itself was of Thracian origin.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Language===\nA major problem in determining whether the Cimbri were speaking a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] or a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] is that at this time the Greeks and Romans tended to refer to all groups to the north of their sphere of influence as Gauls, Celts, or Germani rather indiscriminately. Caesar seems to be one of the first authors to distinguish the two groups, and he had a political motive for doing so (it was an argument in favour of the Rhine border).<ref>A.A. Lund, ''Die ersten Germanen: Ethnizit\u00e4t und Ethnogenese'', Heidelberg 1998.</ref> Yet, one cannot always trust Caesar and Tacitus when they ascribe individuals and tribes to one or the other category, although Caesar made clear distinctions between the two cultures. Most ancient sources categorize the Cimbri as a Germanic tribe,<ref>[[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Gallic Wars]]'' 1.33.3-4; [[Strabo]], ''Geographica'' 4.4.3, 7.1.3; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 4.100; [[Tacitus]], ''Germania'' 37, ''History'' 4.73.</ref> but some ancient authors include the Cimbri among the Celts.<ref>[[Appian of Alexandria|Appian]], ''Civil Wars'' 1.4.29, ''Illyrica'' 8.3.</ref>\n\nThere are few direct testimonies to the language of the Cimbri: Referring to the Northern Ocean (the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] or the [[North Sea]]), [[Pliny the Elder]] states:<ref>''Naturalis Historia'', 4.95: ''Philemon Morimarusam a Cimbris vocari, hoc est mortuum mare, inde usque ad promunturium Rusbeas, ultra deinde Cronium''.</ref> \"Philemon says that it is called Morimarusa, i.e. the Dead Sea, by the Cimbri, until the promontory of Rubea, and after that Cronium.\" The contemporary Gaulish terms for \u201csea\u201d and \u201cdead\u201d appear to have been ''mori'' and ''*maruo-''; compare their well-attested modern [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] cognates ''muir'' and ''marbh'' ([[Irish language|Irish]]), ''m\u00f4r'' and ''marw'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), and ''mor'' and ''marv'' ([[Breton language|Breton]]).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ahl | first1 = F.

From 1965 to 1995, they made the playoffs 14 times, but did not win another championship or appear in the [[Super Bowl]] during that period.\n\nIn 1995, owner [[Art Modell]], who had purchased the Browns in 1961, announced plans to move the team to [[Baltimore]]. After threats of legal action from the city of Cleveland and fans, [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|a compromise]] was reached in early 1996 that allowed Modell to establish the [[Baltimore Ravens]] as a new franchise while retaining the contracts of all Browns personnel. The Browns' [[intellectual property]], including team name, logos, training facility, and history, were kept [[Trust law|in trust]] and the franchise was regarded by the NFL as suspended, with a new team to be established by 1999 either by [[expansion team|expansion]] or relocation.

Through the 2017 season, the Browns hold the [[List of NFL franchise post-season droughts|longest active playoff drought]] in the NFL, at 15 seasons.\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of the Cleveland Browns}}\n{{details|List of Cleveland Browns seasons}}\n\nThe history of the Cleveland Browns American football team began in 1944 when taxi-cab magnate Arthur B. \"Mickey\" McBride secured a Cleveland franchise in the newly formed [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC). [[Paul Brown]] was the team's namesake and first coach. The Browns began play in 1946 in the AAFC.  The Browns won each of the league's four championship games before the league dissolved in 1949. The team then moved to the more established National Football League (NFL), where it continued to dominate. Between 1950 and 1955, Cleveland reached the NFL championship game every year, winning three times.\n\nMcBride and his partners sold the team to a group of Cleveland businessmen in 1953 for a then-unheard-of $600,000. Eight years later, the team was sold again, this time to a group led by New York advertising executive [[Art Modell]]. Modell fired Brown before the 1963 season, but the team continued to win behind running back [[Jim Brown]]. The Browns won the championship in 1964 and reached the title game the following season, losing to the Green Bay Packers.\n\nWhen the AFL and NFL merged before the 1970 season, Cleveland became part of the new American Football Conference (AFC). While the Browns made it back to the playoffs in 1971 and 1972, they fell into mediocrity through the mid-1970s. A revival of sorts took place in 1979 and 1980, when quarterback Brian Sipe engineered a series of last-minute wins and the Browns came to be called the \"Kardiac Kids\". Under Sipe, however, the Browns did not make it past the first round of the playoffs. Quarterback Bernie Kosar, who the Browns drafted in 1985, led the team to three AFC Championship games in the late 1980s but lost each time to the [[Denver Broncos]]. In 1995, Modell announced he was relocating the Browns to Baltimore, sowing a mix of outrage and bitterness among Cleveland's dedicated fan base. Negotiations and legal battles led to an agreement where Modell was allowed to move the team, but Cleveland kept the Browns' name, colors and history.\n\nAfter three years of suspension while [[Cleveland Stadium]] was demolished and [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]] built in its place, the Browns started play again in 1999 under new owner [[Al Lerner]]. The Browns struggled throughout the 2000s and 2010s, posting a record of 88\u2013216 ({{winpct|88|216}}) since their 1999 return. The Browns have only posted two winning seasons and one playoff appearance ([[2002 Cleveland Browns season|2002]]) since returning to the NFL.  The team's struggles have been magnified since 2012, when the Lerner family sold the team to businessman [[Jimmy Haslam]].  In six seasons under the Haslam ownership, the Browns went through four head coaches and four general managers, none of whom had found success.  In 2016 and 2017 under head coach [[Hue Jackson]], the Browns went 1\u201331 ({{winpct|1|31}}), the worst two-year stretch in NFL history, and received the number one overall draft pick each of those years.\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n{{Main|Cleveland Browns logos and uniforms}}\n\n===Logos===\nThe Browns are the only National Football League team without a helmet logo. The logoless helmet serves as the Browns' official logo. The organization has used several promotional logos throughout the years; players' numbers were painted on the helmets from the [[1957 NFL season|1957]] to [[1960 NFL season|1960]]; and an unused \"CB\" logo<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.sportslogos.net/logos/7/155/full/5225.gif |title=Image of Cleveland Browns \"CB\" helmet |date= |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}</ref> was created in 1965,<ref>{{cite news|last=Grzegorek |first=Vince |url=http://www.clevescene.com/64-and-counting/archives/2010/02/09/the-hunt-for-the-great-orange-brown-and-white-whale-unraveling-the-mystery-of-the-1965-cb-cleveland-browns-helmet-logo |title=The Hunt for the Great Orange, Brown, and White Whale: Unraveling the Mystery of the 1965 \"CB\" Cleveland Browns Helmet Logo &#124; '64 and Counting: Scene's Sports Blog |publisher=Cleveland Scene |date=February 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}</ref> But for much of their history, the Browns' helmets have been an unadorned [[burnt orange]] color with a top stripe of dark brown (officially called \"[[seal brown]]\") divided by a white stripe.\n\nThe team has had various promotional logos throughout the years, such as the \"[[Brownie Elf]]\" mascot or a Brown \"B\" in a white football. While Art Modell did away with the Brownie Elf in the mid-1960s, believing it to be too childish, its use has been revived under the current ownership. The popularity of the Dawg Pound section at First Energy Stadium has led to a brown and orange dog being used for various Browns functions. But overall, the orange, logo-less helmet continues as the primary trademark of the Cleveland Browns.\n\nOn February 24, 2015, the team unveiled its new logos and word marks, the only differences being minor color changes to the helmet with the helmet design remaining largely as is.<ref name=\"NewBrownsLogos2015\"/><ref name=\"BrownsLogosSneakPeek\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Patra|first=Kevin|title=Cleveland Browns unveil new logos|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000473731/article/cleveland-browns-unveil-new-logos |publisher=[[National Football League]] |date=February 24, 2015 |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Uniforms===\nThe original designs of the jerseys, pants, and socks remained mostly the same, but the helmets went through many significant revisions throughout the years. The Browns uniforms saw their first massive change prior to the 2015 season.\n\n'''Jerseys:''' 1. Brown: Brown (officially \"[[seal brown]]\") with orange colored numbers and writing, and an orange-white-orange stripe sequence on the sleeves. 2. White (Away): white with orange numbers and writing, with a brown-orange-brown stripe sequence. 3. Orange: Orange with white numerals and writing, and a brown-white-brown stripe sequence.\n\n'''Pants:''' 1. Brown - Brown pants with an orange-white-orange stripe sequence down 2/3rds the length of the pants. the other third is the word \"BROWNS,\" written in orange. 2. White - white pants with a brown-orange-brown stripes. \"BROWNS\" Is written in Brown. 3. Orange - Orange pants with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence. \"BROWNS\" is written in brown.\n\n'''Socks:''' 1. Solid Brown. 2. Solid white. 3. solid Orange.\n\n'''Helmet:''' Solid white (1946\u20131949); solid white for day games and solid orange for night games (1950\u20131951); orange with a single white stripe (1952\u20131956); orange with a single white stripe and brown numerals on the sides (1957\u20131959); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence and brown numerals on the sides (1960); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence (1961\u20131995 and 1999\u2013present).\n\nOver the years, the Browns have had on-again / off-again periods of wearing white for their home games, particularly in the 1970s and 80s, as well as in the early 2000s after the team returned to the league. Until recently, when more NFL teams have started to wear white at home at least once a season, the Browns were the only non-[[subtropical]] team north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to wear white at home on a regular basis.\n\nNumerals (called \"TV numbers\") first appeared on the jersey sleeves in 1961. Over the years, there have been minor revisions to the sleeve stripes, the first occurring in 1968 (brown jerseys worn in early season) and 1969 (white and brown jerseys) when stripes began to be silk screened onto the sleeves and separated from each other to prevent color bleeding. However, the basic five-stripe sequence has remained intact (with the exception of the 1984 season). A recent revision was the addition of the initials \"AL\" to honor team owner [[Al Lerner]] who died in 2002; this was removed in 2013 upon Jimmy Haslam assuming ownership of the team.\n\nOrange pants with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence were worn from 1975 to 1983 and become symbolic of the \"Kardiac Kids\" era. The orange pants were worn again occasionally in 2003 and 2004.\n\nOther than the helmet, the uniform was completely redesigned for the 1984 season. New striping patterns appeared on the white jerseys, brown jerseys and pants. Solid brown socks were worn with brown jerseys and solid orange socks were worn with white jerseys. Brown numerals on the white jerseys were outlined in orange. White numerals on the brown jerseys were double outlined in brown and orange. (Orange numerals double outlined in brown and white appeared briefly on the brown jerseys in one pre-season game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kFlAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v1YMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1066,2673152|title=Browns' Home Jerseys Will Be Modified|newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator|date=August 8, 1984|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}</ref>) However, this particular uniform set was not popular with the fans, and in 1985 the uniform was returned to a look similar to the original design. It remained that way until 1995.\n\nIn 1999, the expansion Browns adopted the traditional design with two exceptions: first, the TV numbers, previously on the sleeves, were moved to the shoulders; and second, the orange-brown-orange pants stripes were significantly widened.\n\nExperimentation with the uniform design began in 2002. An alternate orange jersey was introduced that season as the NFL encouraged teams to adopt a third jersey, and a major design change was made when solid brown socks appeared for the first time since 1984 and were used with white, brown and orange jerseys. Other than 1984, striped socks (matching the jersey stripes) had been a signature design element in the team's traditional uniform. The white striped socks appeared occasionally with the white jerseys in 2003\u20132005 and 2007.\n\nExperimentation continued in 2003 and 2004 when the traditional orange-brown-orange stripes on the white pants were replaced by two variations of a brown-orange-brown sequence, one in which the stripes were joined (worn with white jerseys) and the other in which they were separated by white (worn with brown jerseys). The joined sequence was used exclusively with both jerseys in 2005. In 2006, the traditional orange-brown-orange sequence returned.\n\nAdditionally in 2006, the team reverted to an older uniform style, featuring gray face masks; the original stripe pattern on the brown jersey sleeves (The white jersey has had that sleeve stripe pattern on a consistent basis since the 1985 season.) and the older, darker shade of brown.\n\nThe Browns wore brown pants for the first time in team history on August 18, 2008, preseason game against the [[New York Giants]]. The pants contain no stripes or markings. The team had the brown pants created as an option for their away uniform when they integrated the gray facemask in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=8699 |title=Cleveland Browns &#124; Brown out |publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822033723/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=8699 |archivedate=August 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> They were not worn again until the Browns \"family\" scrimmage on August 9, 2009 with white-striped socks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2009/08/scrimmage_shows_offense_still.html|title=Scrimmage shows Cleveland Browns' offense still needs work|publisher=Cleveland.com|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref> The Browns have continued to wear the brown pants throughout the 2009 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/nfl/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/1248597145139770.xml&coll=2|title=Cleveland Browns might wear brown pants for all road games during 2009 NFL season|publisher=Cleveland.com|date=|accessdate=July 26, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623012714/http://www.cleveland.com/nfl/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fsports%2F1248597145139770.xml&coll=2|archivedate=June 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Browns quarterback [[Brady Quinn]] supported the team's move to wearing the brown pants full-time, claiming that the striped pattern on the white pants \"prohibit[ed] mobility\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2009/08/cleveland_browns_scrimmage_ans.html|title=Cleveland Browns' scrimmage answers some Brady Quinn concerns; WR Leggett impresses|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|accessdate=August 10, 2009}}</ref>\nHowever, the fans generally did not like the brown pants, and after being used for only one season, the team returned to their white shirt-on-white pants in 2010.

In addition, the team has had historical rivalries with the [[Indianapolis Colts]], [[Denver Broncos]], [[Buffalo Bills]], and [[Detroit Lions]].\n\nThe team's biggest rival in the AAFC was the [[San Francisco 49ers]], though this has cooled and in some cases turned into a friendly relationship, as the Browns now play in AFC and the 49ers play in the NFC. Additionally, many 49ers personnel helped the Browns relaunch in 1999 as well as former team President [[Mike Holmgren]] having started his NFL career in San Francisco. Also, 49ers owners [[John York]] and [[Denise DeBartolo York]] reside in [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], 60 miles southeast of Cleveland. Former long-time veteran placekicker and fan favorite, [[Phil Dawson]], signed with the 49ers in 2014, along with backup quarterback [[Colt McCoy]].\n\n===Divisional rivalries===\n\n====Pittsburgh Steelers====\n{{main|Browns\u2013Steelers rivalry}}\n\nOften called the \"Turnpike Rivalry\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kdka.com/local/Steelers.Browns.rivalry.2.564970.html |title=Steelers To Take On Browns For First Place In The AFC North |publisher=Kdka.com |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}</ref> the Browns' main rival has long been the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Though the Browns dominated this rivalry early in the series (winning the first eight matchups), the Steelers currently have the all-time edge 74\u201358, making it the oldest rivalry in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]]. Former Browns owner [[Art Modell]] scheduled home games against the Steelers on Saturday night from 1964 to 1970 to help fuel the rivalry. The rivalry has been fueled by the proximity of the two teams, number of championships both teams have won, players and personnel having played and/or coached for both sides, and personal bitterness. Though the rivalry has cooled in Pittsburgh due to the Modell move (as well as the Browns having a 6\u201333 record against the Steelers since returning to the league in 1999, including one playoff loss), the Steelers are still top rival for Cleveland.\n\n====Cincinnati Bengals====\n{{main|Bengals\u2013Browns rivalry}}\n\nOriginally conceived due to the personal animosity between [[Paul Brown]] and [[Art Modell]], the \"Battle of Ohio\" between the Browns and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] has been fueled by the sociocultural differences between [[Cincinnati]] and Cleveland, a shared history between the two teams, and even similar team colors, since Brown used the exact shade of orange for the Bengals that he used for the Browns. (Though this has changed since then, as the Bengals now use a brighter shade of orange.) Modell, in fact, moved the Browns to the AFC after the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] in order to have a rivalry with the Bengals. The rivalry has also produced two of the eight highest-scoring games in NFL history. Cincinnati has the all-time edge 50\u201339, having won the majority of games against the Browns since they returned to the NFL in 1999 (25 wins for Cincinnati and 12 wins for Cleveland).\n\n====Baltimore Ravens====\n{{main|Browns\u2013Ravens rivalry}}\nCreated as a result of the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy]], the rivalry between the Browns and [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]] was more directed at Art Modell than the team itself, and is simply considered a divisional game in Baltimore. Unlike the other two rivalries, this one is more lopsided: the Ravens lead 29\u20139. Additionally, this matchup is more bitter for Cleveland than the others due to the fact that the draft picks for 1995 to 1998 resulted in the rosters that won the [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl]] for the Ravens in 2000. Had the Browns stayed in Cleveland, these teams (drafted by general manager [[Ozzie Newsome]]) might have given the Browns the title after a 35-year drought.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rav/|title=Baltimore Ravens Team Encyclopedia|publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}</ref> This bitterness was compounded when the Ravens won their second [[Super Bowl XLVII|Super Bowl]] in 2012.\n\n===Other rivalries===\n\n====Detroit Lions====\nThe Lions rivalry began in the 1950s, when the Browns and Lions played each other in four NFL championships. The Lions won three of those championships, while the Browns won one. This was arguably one of the NFL's best rivalries in the 1950s. Since the NFL-AFL merger of 1970, the teams have met much less frequently with the Browns' move to the AFC. From 2002 to 2014, the two teams played an annual preseason game known as the \"Great Lakes Classic\".<ref name=\"The Great Lakes Classic\">{{cite news|url=http://www.morningjournal.com/articles/2009/11/22/sports/mj1925578.txt|title=Great Lakes Classic has lacked luster since its beginning|date=November 22, 2009|accessdate=March 21, 2009|author=Schudel, Jeff|publisher=[[The Morning Journal]]}}</ref>\n\n====Buffalo Bills====\nThe Bills rivalry had its roots back to the days of the AAFC, when there was a [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|team from Buffalo with the same name]] in that league. The Browns and AAFC Bills played six games, including a league championship game, before the Browns were selected to merge into the NFL and the Bills left out. After the current incarnation of the Bills joined the NFL, the Browns and Bills have played each other from time to time. Though the Browns and Bills are in different AFC divisions, a mellow rivalry has since developed between the teams due to the similarities between Buffalo and Cleveland and shared misfortune between the teams. Despite this \"rivalry\" being known for ugly games such as a 6-3 Browns win in which Browns quarterback [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] only completed 2 of 17 passes,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/browns-win-ugly-beat-buffalo-6-3/|title = Browns Win Ugly, Beat Buffalo 6-3|date = October 11, 2009|publisher = CBS News}}</ref> there have been some competitive moments between the Bills and Browns as well, such as a playoff game in 1990 and two games with playoff-implications in 2007 and 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2014/11/cleveland_browns_vs_buffalo_bi_8.html|title = Cleveland Browns vs. Buffalo Bills series has seen it all: A championship, a fired coach and blizzard|first = Tim|last = Warskinskey|work = [[The Plain Dealer]]|publisher = Cleveland.com|date = November 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts====\nThe Colts rivalry was hot in the 1960s. The Browns upset the Colts in the 1964 NFL championship (the last championship to date for the Browns) and the Colts avenged themselves by beating the Browns in the 1968 NFL Championship. The Browns also beat the Indianapolis Colts in a 1987 divisional playoff game.\n\n====Denver Broncos====\nThe Browns had a brief rivalry with the Broncos that arose from three AFC championship games from 1986 to 1989. In the 1986 AFC Championship, quarterback John Elway led [[The Drive]] to secure a tie in the waning moments at Cleveland Municipal Stadium; the Broncos went on to win in 23\u201320 in overtime. One year later, the two teams met again in the [[1986\u201387 NFL playoffs|1987 AFC Championship game]] at Mile High Stadium. Denver took a 21\u20133 lead, but Browns' quarterback Bernie Kosar threw four touchdown passes to tie the game at 31\u201331 halfway through the 4th quarter. After a long drive, John Elway threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to running back Sammy Winder to give Denver a 38\u201331 lead. Cleveland advanced to Denver's 8-yard line with 1:12 left, but Broncos' safety Jeremiah Castille stripped Browns' running back Earnest Byner of the football at the 2-yard line\u2014a play that has been called [[The Fumble]] by Browns' fans. The Broncos recovered it, gave Cleveland an intentional safety, and went on to win 38\u201333. The two teams met yet again in the 1989 AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium, which the Broncos easily won by a score of 37\u201321.\n\n==Fan base==\nA 2006 study conducted by ''Bizjournal'' determined that Browns [[fan (person)|fans]] are the most loyal fans in the NFL. The study, while not [[scientific]], was largely based on fan loyalty during winning and losing seasons, attendance at games, and challenges confronting fans (such as inclement weather or long-term poor performance of their team).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14686579/ |title=Cleveland No. 1 in NFL fan loyalty - NFL- nbcsports.msnbc.com |publisher=Msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211031008/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14686579 |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}</ref> The study noted that Browns fans filled 99.8% of the seats at Cleveland Browns Stadium during the last seven seasons, despite a combined record of 36-76 over that span.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/specials/slideshow/13.html |title=NFL Fan Support Rankings |publisher=Bizjournals.com |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229063926/http://www.bizjournals.com/specials/slideshow/13.html |archivedate=February 29, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Dawg Pound===\n{{main|Dawg Pound}}\nPerhaps the most visible Browns fans are those that can be found in the [[Dawg Pound]].

Carbines were short enough to be loaded and fired from horseback, but this was rarely done{{spaced ndash}}a moving horse is a very unsteady platform, and once halted, a soldier can load and fire more easily if dismounted, which also makes him a smaller target (Napoleonic-era and earlier cavalry did fight from horseback, but they fought with sabers and large muzzle-loading ''horse pistols'', so called because their large size meant they were most easily carried in a saddle holster, much like the later [[Colt Walker|Colt-Walker revolver]]). After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], cavalry began fighting dismounted, using the horses only for greater mobility, an early form of what is today known as [[mechanized infantry]]. By the [[American Civil War]], dismounted cavalry were mostly the rule. The principal advantage of the carbine was that its length made it very portable. Troops could carry full-length muskets comfortably enough on horseback if just riding from A to B (the practice of the original [[dragoon]]s and other [[mounted infantry]]). Cavalry proper (a \"Regiment of Horse\") had to ride with some agility and engage in sword-wielding mel\u00e9es with opposing cavalry or pursue running infantry, so carrying anything long would be a dangerous encumbrance. A carbine was typically no longer than a sheathed sabre, and like a sheathed sabre was carried arranged to hang clear of the rider's elbows and horse's legs.\n\nCarbines were usually less accurate and less powerful than the longer muskets (and later rifles) of the infantry, due to a shorter [[Sight (device)|sight]] plane and lower velocity of bullets fired from the shortened barrel. With the advent of fast-burning [[smokeless powder]], the velocity disadvantages of a shorter barrel became less of an issue (see [[internal ballistics]]). Eventually, the use of horse-mounted cavalry would decline. But carbines continued to be issued and used by many who preferred a lighter, more compact weapon even at the cost of reduced long-range accuracy and power, such as artillery troops, who might need to defend themselves from attack but would be hindered by keeping full-sized rifles around; thus, a common title for many short rifles in the late 19th century was ''artillery carbine''.\n\nDuring the early 19th century, carbines were often developed separately from the infantry rifles and, in many cases, did not even use the same ammunition, which made for supply difficulties. A notable weapon developed towards the end of the [[American Civil War]] by the Union was the [[Spencer carbine]], one of the very first [[Breech-loading weapon|breechloading]], [[Repeating rifle|repeating]] weapons. It had a spring-powered, removable [[Magazine (firearm)|tube magazine]] in the buttstock which held seven rounds and could be reloaded by inserting spare tubes. It was intended to give the cavalry a replacement weapon which could be fired from horseback without the need for awkward reloading after each shot (although it saw service mostly with dismounted troopers and infantrymen, as was typical of cavalry weapons during that war). In the late 19th century, it became common for a number of nations to make [[bolt-action]] rifles in both full-length and carbine versions. One of the most popular and recognizable carbines were the [[lever-action]] [[Winchester rifle|Winchester carbines]], with several versions available firing [[revolver]] cartridges. This made it an ideal choice for [[cowboy]]s and explorers, as well as other inhabitants of the [[Western United States|American West]], who could carry a revolver and a carbine, both using the same ammunition.\n\nThe [[Lee\u2013Enfield#Magazine Lee\u2013Enfield|Lee Enfield Cavalry Carbine]] (LEC) a shortened version of the standard British Army infantry rifle was introduced in 1896, although it did not become the standard British cavalry weapon until 1903.\n\n===Shorter rifles, shorter carbines: World War I and World War II===\n[[File:Garandcar.jpg|thumb|M1 Garand and M1 Carbine]]\n\nIn the decades following [[World War I]], the standard battle rifle used by armies around the world had been growing shorter, either by redesign or by the general issue of carbine versions instead of full-length rifles. This move was initiated by the US [[M1903 Springfield|Model 1903 Springfield]], which was originally produced in 1907 with a short 24-inch barrel, providing a short rifle that was longer than a carbine but shorter than a typical rifle, so it could be issued to all troops without need for separate versions. Other nations followed suit after World War I, when they learned that their traditional long-barreled rifles provided little benefit in the trenches and merely proved a hindrance to the soldiers. Examples include the Russian [[Mosin\u2013Nagant|Model 1891 rifle]], originally with an {{convert|800|mm|in|abbr=on}} barrel, later shortened to {{convert|730|mm|in|abbr=on}} in 1930, and to {{convert|510|mm|in|abbr=on}} in 1938, the German [[Mauser]] [[Gewehr 98]] rifles went from {{convert|740|mm|in|abbr=on}} in 1898 to {{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=on}} in 1935 as the ''[[Karabiner 98k]]'' (K98k or Kar98k), or \"short carbine\". The barrel lengths in rifles used by the [[United States]] did not change between the [[bolt-action]] [[M1903 Springfield rifle|M1903]] rifle of [[World War I]] and the [[World War II]] [[M1 Garand]] rifle, because the {{convert|610|mm|in|abbr=on}} barrel on the M1903 was still shorter than even the shortened versions of the Model 1891 and Gewehr 98. The US [[M1 carbine]] was more of a traditional carbine in that it was significantly shorter and lighter, with a {{convert|457.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} barrel, than the M1 Garand rifle, and that it was intended for rear-area troops who couldn't be hindered with full-sized rifles but needed something more powerful and accurate than a [[M1911 pistol|Model 1911 pistol]] (although this didn't stop soldiers from using them on the front line). Contrary to popular belief, and even what some books claim, in spite of both being designated \"M1\", the M1 Carbine was ''not'' a shorter version of the [[.30-06 Springfield|.30-06]] [[M1 Garand]], as is typical for most rifles and carbines, but a wholly different design firing [[.30 Carbine|a smaller, less-powerful cartridge]]. The \"M1\" designates each as the first model in the new US designation system, which no longer used the year of introduction, but a sequential series of numbers starting at \"1\": the M1 ''Carbine'' and M1 ''Rifle''.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom]] also developed a \"[[Jungle Carbine]]\" version of their [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] service rifle, featuring a shorter barrel, flash suppressor, and manufacturing modifications designed to decrease the rifle's weight. Officially titled ''Rifle, No. 5 Mk I'', it was introduced in the closing months of World War II, but it did not see widespread service until the [[Korean War]], the [[Mau Mau Uprising]], and the [[Malayan Emergency]].\n\n===After World War II===\n[[File:Karabiner 98k.jpg|thumb|right|Mauser ''[[Karabiner 98k|Karabiner 98 Kurz]]''. Translate as '''Carbine 98 Short''' or a shortened carbine of the [[Gewehr 98]].]]\n[[File:FAL IMG 1528.jpg|thumb|right|[[FN FAL]] rifle - (left) full size, (right) carbine/paratrooper variant with a folding stock and shortened barrel]]\nA shorter weapon was more convenient when riding in a truck, [[armored personnel carrier]], [[helicopter]], or aircraft, and also when engaged in close-range combat. Based on the combat experience of World War II, the criteria used for selecting infantry weapons began to change. Unlike previous wars, which were often fought mainly from fixed lines and trenches, World War II was a highly mobile war, often fought in cities, forests, or other areas where mobility and visibility were restricted. In addition, improvements in [[artillery]] made moving infantry in open areas even less practical than it had been.\n\nThe majority of enemy contacts were at ranges of less than {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=off}}, and the enemy was exposed to fire for only short periods of time as they moved from cover to cover. Most rounds fired were not aimed at an enemy combatant, but instead fired in the enemy's direction to keep them from moving and firing back (see [[suppressive fire]]). These situations did not require a heavy rifle, firing full-power rifle bullets with long-range accuracy. A less-powerful weapon would still produce casualties at the shorter ranges encountered in actual combat, and the reduced recoil would allow more shots to be fired in the short amount of time an enemy was visible. The lower-powered round would also weigh less, allowing a soldier to carry more ammunition. With no need of a long barrel to fire full-power ammunition, a shorter barrel could be used. A shorter barrel made the weapon weigh less, was easier to handle in tight spaces, and was easier to shoulder quickly to fire a shot at an unexpected target. [[Automatic firearm|Full-automatic]] fire was also considered a desirable feature, allowing the soldier to fire short bursts of three to five rounds, increasing the probability of a hit on a moving target.\n\nThe Germans had experimented with [[selective-fire]] carbines firing rifle cartridges during the early years of World War II. These were determined to be less than ideal, as the recoil of full-power rifle cartridges caused the weapon to be uncontrollable in full-automatic fire. They then developed an intermediate-power cartridge round, which was accomplished by reducing the power and the length of the standard [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser]] rifle cartridge to create the [[7.92\u00d733mm]] ''Kurz'' (Short) cartridge. A selective-fire weapon was developed to fire this shorter cartridge, eventually resulting in the [[Sturmgewehr 44]], later translated as \"[[assault rifle]]\" (also frequently called \"machine carbines\" by Allied intelligence, a quite accurate assessment, in fact). Very shortly after World War II, the USSR would adopt a similar weapon, the ubiquitous [[AK-47]], the first model in the famed [[Kalashnikov rifle|Kalashnikov-series]], which became the standard Soviet infantry weapon, and which has been produced and exported in extremely large numbers up through the present day. Although the United States had developed the [[M1 carbine|M2 Carbine]], a selective-fire version of the [[M1 carbine|M1 Carbine]] during WW2, the .30 Carbine cartridge was closer to a pistol round in power, making it more of a [[submachine gun]] than an assault rifle. It was also adopted only in very small numbers and issued to few troops (the semi-automatic M1 carbine was produced in a 10-to-1 ratio to the M2), while the AK47 was produced by the millions and was standard-issue to all Soviet troops, as well as those of many other nations. The US was slow to follow suit, insisting on retaining a full-power, [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] rifle, the [[M14 rifle|M14]] (although this ''was'' selective fire), until too-hastily adopting the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56mm]] [[M16 rifle]] in the mid-1960s, with initially poor results due to the rapidity of its introduction (but later to become a highly successful line of rifles and carbines).\n\nIn the 1950s, the British developed the [[.280 British]], an intermediate cartridge, and a select-fire [[bullpup]] assault rifle to fire it, the [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]]. They pressed for the US to adopt it so it could become a NATO-standard round, but the US insisted on retaining a full-power, .30 caliber round. This forced NATO to adopt the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] round (which in reality is only slightly different ballistically to the .30-06 Springfield), to maintain commonality. The British eventually adopted the 7.62mm [[FN FAL]], and the US adopted the 7.62mm [[M14 rifle|M14]]. These rifles are both what is known as ''[[battle rifle]]s'' and were a few inches shorter than the standard-issue rifles they replaced (22\" barrel as opposed to 24\" for the M1 Garand), although they were still full-powered rifles, with selective fire capability. These can be compared to the even shorter, less-powerful [[assault rifle]], which might be considered the \"carbine branch of weapons development\", although indeed, there are now carbine variants of many of the assault rifles which had themselves seemed quite small and light when adopted.\n\n[[File:M855 drop during 25-meter zeroing trajectory M16A2 M4.jpg|thumb|left|Bullet drop of the M16A2 rifle (yellow) vs M4 carbine (red)]]\nBy the 1960s, after becoming involved in [[Vietnam War|War in Vietnam]], the US did an abrupt about-face and decided to standardize on the intermediate [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56\u00d745mm]] round (based on the [[.223 Remington]] [[Varmint rifle|varmint cartridge]]) fired from the new, lightweight [[M16 rifle]], leaving NATO to hurry and catch up. Many of the NATO countries couldn't afford to re-equip so soon after the recent 7.62mm standardization, leaving them armed with full-power 7.62mm battle rifles for some decades afterwards, although by this point, the 5.56mm has been adopted by almost all NATO countries and many non-NATO nations as well. This 5.56mm NATO round was even lighter and smaller than the Soviet [[7.62\u00d739mm]] AK-47 cartridge, but possessed higher velocity. In U.S. service, the [[M16 rifle|M16 assault rifle]] replaced the M14 as the standard [[infantry]] weapon, although the M14 continued to be used by [[designated marksmen]]. Although at 20\", the barrel of the M16 was shorter than that of the M14, it was still designated a \"rifle\" rather than a \"carbine\", and it was still longer than the AK, which used a 16\" barrel. (The [[SKS]] \u2013 an interim, semi-automatic, weapon adopted a few years before the AK-47 was put into service \u2013 was designated a carbine, even though it's 20\" barrel was significantly longer than the AK series' 16.3\". This is because of the Kalashnikov's revolutionary nature, which altered the old paradigm. Compared to previous rifles, particularly the Soviets' initial attempts at semi-automatic rifles, such as the 24\" [[SVT-40]], the SKS was significantly shorter. The Kalashnikov altered traditional notions and ushered in a change in what was considered a \"rifle\" in military circles.)\n\nIn 1974, shortly after the introduction of the 5.56mm NATO, the USSR began to issue a new Kalashnikov variant, the [[AK-74]], chambered in the small-bore [[5.45\u00d739mm]] cartridge, which was a standard 7.62\u00d739mm necked down to take a smaller, lighter, faster bullet. It soon became standard issue in Soviet nations, although many of the nations with export Kalashnikovs retained the larger 7.62\u00d739mm round. In 1995, the [[China|People's Republic of China]] adopted a new [[5.8\u00d742mm]] cartridge to match the modern trend in military ammunition, replacing the previous 7.62\u00d739mm round as standard.\n\nLater, even lighter carbines variants of many of these short-barreled assault rifles came to be adopted as the standard infantry weapon. In much modern tactical thinking, only a certain number of soldiers now need to retain longer-range weapons, these serving as [[Designated marksman|designated marksmen]]. The rest can carry lighter, shorter-ranged weapons for [[Close quarters combat|close-quarters combat]] and [[suppressive fire]]. This is basically a more extreme extension of the idea that brought the original assault rifle. Another factor is that with the increasing weight of technology, sighting systems, [[Armour|ballistic armor]], etc., the only way to reduce the burden on the modern soldier was to equip him/her with a smaller, lighter weapon. Also, modern soldier rely a great deal on vehicles and helicopters to transport them around the battle area, and a longer weapon can be a serious hindrance to entering and exiting these vehicles. Development of lighter assault rifles continued, matched by developments in even lighter carbines. In spite of the short barrels of the new assault rifles, carbines variants like the [[5.45\u00d739mm]] [[AKS-74U]] and [[CAR-15|Colt Commando]] were being developed for use when mobility was essential and a submachine gun wasn't sufficiently powerful. The AKS-74U featured an extremely short 8.1\" barrel which necessitated redesigning and shortening the [[Gas-operated reloading|gas-piston]] and integrating front sights onto the gas tube; the Colt Commando was a bit longer, at 11.5\". Neither was adopted as standard issue, although the US did later adopt the somewhat-longer M4 carbine, with a 14.5\" barrel.\n\n==Modern history==\n\n===Contemporary military forces===\n{{Double image|right|AUG A1 508mm 04.jpg|200|AUG A1 407mm 03.jpg|176|[[Steyr AUG]] ''rifle'' ({{convert|508|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} barrel).|Steyr AUG ''carbine'' ({{convert|407|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} barrel). Carbine conversion is achieved by changing to a shorter barrel.}}\n[[File:OH-58D 2.jpg|thumb|right|Two M4 carbines stowed ahead of the [[flight instrument]] panel of a US Army OH-58D reconnaissance helicopter, over Iraq in 2004.]]\n\nBy the 1990s, the US had adopted the [[M4 carbine]], a derivative of the M16 family which fired the same [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56mm cartridge]] but was lighter and shorter (in overall length and barrel length), resulting in marginally reduced range and power, although offering better mobility and lighter weight to offset the weight of equipment and armor that a modern soldier has to carry.\n\nHowever, in spite of the benefits of the modern carbine, many armies are experiencing a certain backlash against the universal equipping of soldiers with carbines and lighter rifles in general, and are equipping selected soldiers, usually called [[Designated marksman|Designated Marksmen]], or DM, with higher-power rifles. Another problem comes from the loss of muzzle velocity caused by the shorter barrel, which when coupled with the typical small, lightweight bullets, causes effectiveness to be diminished; a 5.56mm gets its lethality from its high velocity, and when fired from the 14.5\" M4 carbine, its power, penetration, and range are diminished. Thus, there has been a move towards adopting a slightly more powerful round tailored for high performance from both long and short barrels. The US has done experiments regarding adopting a new, slightly larger and heavier caliber such as the [[6.5mm Grendel]] or [[6.8mm Remington SPC]], which are heavier and thus retain more effectiveness at lower muzzle velocities, but has for the time decided to retain the 5.56mm NATO round as standard issue.\n\nWhile the US Army adopted the M4 carbine in the 1990s, the US Marine Corps retained their 20\" barrel M16A4 rifles long afterwards, citing the increased range and effectiveness over the carbine version; officers were required to carry an M4 carbine rather than an M9 pistol, as Army officers do. Due to the Marine Corps emphasis on being [[Rifleman|riflemen]], the lighter carbine was considered a suitable compromise between a rifle and a pistol. Marines with restricted mobility such as vehicle operators, or a greater need for mobility such as squad leaders, were also issued M4 carbines. In July 2015, the Marine Corps approved the M4 carbine for standard issue to front-line Marines, replacing the M16A4 rifle. The rifles will be issued to support troops while the carbines go to the front-line Marines, in a reversal of the traditional roles of \"rifles for the front line, carbines for the rear\".\n\n===Special forces===\nSpecial forces need to perform fast, decisive operations, frequently airborne or boat-mounted. A [[pistol]], though light and quick to operate, is viewed as not having enough power, firepower, or range. A [[submachine gun]] has selective fire, but firing a pistol cartridge and having a short barrel and sight radius, it is not accurate or powerful enough at longer ranges. Submachine guns also tend to have poorer armor and cover penetration than rifles and carbines firing rifle ammunition. Consequently, carbines have gained wide acceptance among [[United States Special Operations Command|SOCOM]], [[United Kingdom Special Forces|UKSF]], and other communities, having relatively light weight, large magazine capacity, selective fire, and much better range and penetration than a submachine gun.\n\n==Usage==\nThe smaller size and relative lighter weight of carbines makes them easier to handle in close-quarter situations such as [[urban warfare|urban]] engagements, when deploying from military vehicles, or in any situation where space is confined. The disadvantages of carbines relative to rifles include inferior long-range accuracy and a shorter effective range. These comparisons refer to carbines (short-barreled rifles) of the same power and class as the regular full-sized rifles.\n\nCompared to [[submachine gun]]s, assault carbines have a greater effective range and are capable of penetrating the [[Combat helmet|helmet]]s and [[Personal armor|body armor]] used by modern [[infantry]]men.<ref name=\"defensereview.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.defensereview.com/submachine-guns-smgs-outpaced-by-today%E2%80%99s-modern-short-barreled-rifles-sbrssub-carbines-or-still-a-viable-tool-for-close-quarters-battleclose-quarters-combat-cqbcqc/ |title=Submachine Guns (SMG's): Outpaced by Today's Modern Short-Barreled Rifles (SBR's)/Sub-Carbines, or Still a Viable Tool for Close Quarters Battle/Close Quarters Combat (CQB/CQC)? |last=Gurwitch |first=Jeff |date=December 11, 2011 |website=Defense Review |access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref> However, submachine guns are still used by [[special forces|military special forces]] and [[SWAT|police SWAT teams]] for close quarters battle (CQB) because they are \"a pistol caliber weapon that's easy to control, and less likely to over-penetrate the target.\"<ref name=\"defensereview.com\"/> Also, carbines are harder to maneuver in tight encounters where superior range and [[stopping power]] at distance are not great considerations.\n\nFiring the same ammunition as standard-issue rifles or pistols gives carbines the advantage of standardization over those [[personal defense weapon]]s (PDWs) that require proprietary [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]].\n\nThe modern usage of the term carbine covers much the same scope as it always had, namely lighter weapons (generally rifles) with barrels up to 20 inches in length. These weapons can be considered carbines, while rifles with barrels longer than 20 inches are generally not considered carbines unless specifically named so. Conversely, many rifles have barrels ''shorter'' than 20\", yet aren't considered carbines. The AK series rifles has an almost universal barrel length of 16.3\", well within carbine territory, yet has always been considered a rifle, perhaps because it was designed as such and not shortened from a longer weapon. Modern carbines use ammunition ranging from that used in light pistols up to powerful rifle cartridges, with the usual exception of high-velocity magnum cartridges. In the more powerful cartridges, the short barrel of a carbine has significant disadvantages in velocity, and the high residual pressure, and frequently still-burning powder and gases, when the bullet exits the barrel results in substantially greater [[Muzzle flash|muzzle blast]]. [[Flash suppressor]]s are a common, partial solution to this problem, although even the best flash suppressors are hard put to deal with the excess flash from the still-burning powder leaving the short barrel (and they also add several inches to the length of the barrel, diminishing the purpose of having a short barrel in the first place). The shorter the barrel, the more difficult it is to hide the flash; the [[AK-74|AKS-74U]] has a complex, effective muzzle-booster/flash suppressor, yet it still suffers from extreme muzzle flash.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Pistol-caliber carbine===\n[[File:Marlin Model 1894C .357 Magnum.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Marlin Model 1894]]C \u2014 .357 Magnum carbine]]\nOne of the more atypical classes of carbine is the pistol-caliber carbine, or PCC. These first appeared soon after metallic cartridges became common. These were developed as \"companions\" to the popular [[revolver]]s of the day, firing the same cartridge but allowing more velocity and accuracy than the revolver. These were carried by [[cowboy]]s, lawmen, and others in the [[Old West]]. The classic combination would be a [[Winchester rifle|Winchester]] lever-action carbine and a [[Colt Single Action Army]] revolver in [[.44-40 Winchester|.44-40]] or [[.38-40 Winchester|.38-40]]. During the 20th century, this trend continued with more modern and powerful smokeless revolver cartridges, in the form of [[Winchester Model 1894|Winchester]] and [[Marlin Model 1894|Marlin]] lever action carbines [[chamber (firearms)|chambered]] in [[.38 Special]]/[[.357 Magnum]] and [[.44 Special]]/[[.44 Magnum]].\n\nModern equivalents include the [[Ruger Police Carbine]], which uses the same magazine as the Ruger [[pistol]]s of the same caliber, and the (discontinued) [[Marlin Camp Carbine]], which, in .45ACP, used M1911 magazines. The [[Ruger Model 44]] and [[Ruger Deerfield Carbine]] were both carbines chambered in [[.44 Magnum]]. The [[Beretta Cx4 Storm]] shares magazines with many [[Beretta]] pistols and is designed to be complementary to the [[Beretta Px4 Storm]] pistol. The [[Hi-Point 995 & 995ts Carbines]] are popular, economical and reliable alternatives to other pistol caliber carbines in the [[United States]], and their magazines can be used in the [[Hi-Point C-9 and C-9 Comp|Hi-Point C-9]] pistol. Another example is the [[Kel-Tec SUB-2000]] series chambered in either 9&nbsp;mm Luger or .40S&W, which can be configured to accept Glock, Beretta, S&W, or SIG pistol magazines. The SUB-2000 also has the somewhat unusual (although not unique) ability to fold in half.\n\n[[File:Kel-Tec SUB-2000.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Kel-Tec SUB-2000]] carbine in [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]].]]\nThe primary advantage of a carbine over a pistol using the same ammunition is controllability. The combination of firing from the shoulder, longer sight-radius, 3 points of contact (firing hand, support hand & shoulder), and precision offer a significantly more user-friendly platform. Carbines like the [[Kel-Tec SUB-2000]], [[Hi Point 995ts]] and [[Beretta Cx4 Storm]] have the ability to mount user friendly optics, lights and lasers thanks to them having accessory rails, which make target acquisition and engagement much easier.\n\nThe longer barrel can offer increased velocity and, with it, greater energy and effective range due to the propellant having more time to burn. However, loss in bullet velocity can happen where the propellant is utilised before the bullet reaches the muzzle, combined with the friction from the barrel on the bullet. As long guns, pistol-caliber carbines may be less legally restricted than handguns in some jurisdictions. Compared to carbines chambered in [[intermediate cartridge|intermediate]] or [[rifle cartridge|rifle]] calibers, such as [[.223 Remington]] and [[7.62\u00d754mmR]], pistol-caliber carbines generally experience less of an increase in [[external ballistics|external ballistic]] properties as a result of the [[smokeless powder#Physical variations|propellant]]. The drawback is that one loses the primary benefits of a handgun, i.e. portability and concealability, resulting in a weapon almost the size of, but less accurate than, a long-gun, but not much more powerful than a pistol.\n\nAlso widely produced are semi-automatic and typically longer-barreled derivatives of select-fire [[submachine gun]]s, such as the [[FN P90#Semi-automatic models|FN PS90]], [[Heckler & Koch UMP#Variants|HK USC]], [[KRISS Vector]], [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson carbine]], and the [[Uzi#Civilian variants|Uzi carbine]]. In order to be sold legally in many countries, the barrel must meet a minimum length (16\" in the USA). So the original submachine gun in given a legal-length barrel and made into a semi-automatic, transforming it into a carbine. Though less common, pistol-caliber conversions of [[Centerfire ammunition|centerfire]] rifles like the [[AR-15]] are commercially available.\n\n===Shoulder-stocked handgun===\nSome handguns used to come from the factory with mounting lugs for a shoulder stock, notably including the \"Broomhandle\" [[Mauser C96]], [[Luger pistol|Luger P.08]], and [[Browning Hi-Power]]. In the case of the first two, the pistol could come with a hollow wooden stock that doubled as a holster.\n\nCarbine conversion kits are commercially available for many other pistols, including [[M1911 pistol|M1911]] and most [[Glock]]s. These can either be simple shoulder stocks fitted to a pistol or full carbine conversion kits, which are at least {{convert|26|in|mm|abbr=on}} long and replace the pistol's barrel with one at least {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} long for compliance with the [[United States|US]] law. In the US, fitting a shoulder stock to a handgun with a barrel less than 16\" long legally turns it into a [[short-barreled rifle]], which is in violation of the [[National Firearms Act]].\n\n==Legal issues==\n\n===United States===\nUnder the [[National Firearms Act of 1934]], firearms with shoulder stocks or originally manufactured as a rifle and barrels less than {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} in length are classified as [[short-barreled rifle]]s. Short-barreled rifles are restricted similarly to [[Sawed-off shotgun#United States|short-barreled shotguns]], requiring a $200 tax paid prior to manufacture or transfer \u2013 a process which can take several months. Because of this, firearms with barrels of less than {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} and a shoulder stock are uncommon.

By replacing the pistol barrel with one at least {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} in length and having an overall length of at least {{convert|26|in|mm|abbr=on}}, a carbine converted pistol may be treated as a standard rifle under Title I of the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] (GCA).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.atf.gov/file/55526/download |title=ATF Rule 2011-4 pertaining to Carbine Conversion Units |website=Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives |accessdate=November 16, 2015}}</ref> However, certain \"Broomhandle\" [[Mauser C96]], [[Luger pistol|Luger]], and [[Browning Hi-Power]] Curio & Relic pistols with their originally issued stock attached only may retain their pistol classification.\n\nCarbines without a stock and not originally manufactured as a rifle are not classified as rifles or short barreled rifles. A carbine manufactured under {{convert|26|in|mm|abbr=on}} in length [[Foregrip#Legality on pistols in the United States|without a forward vertical grip]] will be a pistol and, state law notwithstanding, can be carried concealed without creating an unregistered [[Title II weapons#Any other weapon|Any Other Weapon]]. A nearly identical carbine with an overall length of {{convert|26|in|mm|abbr=on}} or greater is simply an unclassified firearm under Title I of the Gun Control Act of 1968, as the Any Other Weapon catch-all only applies to firearms under {{convert|26|in|mm|abbr=on}} or that have been concealed. However, a modification intending to fire from the shoulder and bypass the regulation of short-barreled rifles is considered the unlawful possession and manufacture of an unregistered short-barreled rifle.\n\nIn some historical cases, the term ''machine carbine'' was the official title for submachine guns, such as the British [[Sten]] and Australian [[Owen gun]]s. The semiautomatic-only version of the [[Sterling submachine gun]] was also officially called a \"carbine\". The original Sterling semi-auto would be classed a \"short barrel rifle\" under the U.S. [[National Firearms Act]], but fully legal long-barrel versions of the Sterling have been made for the U.S. collector market.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [[List of carbines]]\n* [[Personal defense weapon]]\n* [[Short-barreled rifle]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Beard, Ross E.

Because of the [[Chinese diaspora]] and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in [[Asia]], with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as [[rice]], [[soy sauce]], [[noodles]], [[tea]], and [[tofu]]; and utensils such as [[chopsticks]] and the [[wok]] can now be found worldwide.\n\nThe preference for [[seasoning]] and [[Chinese cooking techniques|cooking techniques]] of Chinese provinces depend on differences in [[history of Chinese cuisine|historical background]] and [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups]].

The first domesticated crops seem to have been the [[foxtail millet|foxtail]] and [[broomcorn millet|broomcorn]] varieties of [[millet]], while [[rice]] was cultivated in the south. By 2000 BC, wheat had arrived from western Asia. These grains were typically served as warm [[noodle]] soups instead of baked into bread as in Europe. Nobles hunted various wild game and consumed [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]], pork and [[Dog meat#Mainland China|dog]] as these animals were domesticated. Grain was stored against famine and flood and meat was preserved with salt, vinegar, curing, and fermenting. The flavor of the meat was enhanced by cooking it in animal fats though this practice was mostly restricted to the wealthy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibiblio.org/chineseculture/contents/food/p-food-c01s01.html|title=The Cultural Heritage of China :: Food & Drink :: Cuisine :: Introduction|last=Wertz|first=Richard R.|website=www.ibiblio.org|access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of [[Confucius]] in the [[Warring States period|late Zhou]], gastronomy had become a high art. Confucius discussed the principles of dining: \"The rice would never be too white, the meat would never be too finely cut... When it was not cooked right, man would not eat.

[[Prawn cracker]]s are an often-consumed snack in Southeast China.\n\n===Dairy products===\nChinese in earlier dynasties evidently drank milk and ate dairy products, although not necessarily from cows, but perhaps ''[[koumiss]]'' (fermented mare's milk) or goat's milk.\n\nMany Chinese have until recently avoided milk, partly because pasturage for milk producers in a monsoon rice ecology is not economic,<ref>Jack Goody, ''Cooking, Cuisine, and Class:  A Study in Comparative Sociology'' (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1982), p. 107; Chang, ed., ''Food in Chinese Culture: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', 7, 25, 105-06.</ref> and partly because of the high rate of [[Lactose intolerance#Epidemiology|lactose intolerance among the Chinese population]]. As such the use of dairy products in Chinese cuisine has historically been rare, with regional exceptions such as the \"[[double skin milk]]\" dessert in Guangdong Province.

In the rest part of China, soups are served between the main dish and staple foods, before desserts or fruit salad.\n\n==Drinks==\nTea plays an important role in Chinese dining culture. [[Baijiu]] and [[huangjiu]] as strong alcoholic beverages are preferred by many people as well.

This has resulted in a deep Chinese influence on other national cuisines such as [[Cambodian cuisine]], [[Thai cuisine]] and [[Vietnamese cuisine]]. There are also a large number of forms of [[fusion cuisine]], often popular in the country in question. Some, such as [[ramen]] ([[Japanese Chinese cuisine]]) have become popular internationally.\n\nDeep fried meat combined with [[sweet and sour]] sauce as a cooking style receives an enormous preference outside of China. Therefore, many similar international Chinese cuisines are invented based on sweet and sour sauce, including Sweet and sour chicken (Europe and North America), Manchurian chicken (India) or ''[[tangsuyuk]]'' (South Korea). The [[Hawaiian pizza]] was inspired by Chinese sweet and sour flavors.\n\nThe large Chinese population in the United States operates many restaurants, has developed distinctive dishes (such as [[chop suey]]) based originally on Cantonese cuisine, while those are not popular among American Chinese people.<ref>Andrew Coe, ''Chop Suey: A Cultural History of Chinese Food in the United States'' (2009)</ref><ref>Yong Chen, ''Chop Suey, USA: The Story of Chinese Food in America'' (2014)</ref>\n\n{{Columns\n|colwidth=50em |col1 =\n* [[American Chinese cuisine]]\n** [[Chop suey]], [[General Tso's chicken]], [[Egg foo young]]\n* [[Canadian Chinese cuisine]]\n* [[Caribbean Chinese cuisine]]\n* [[Filipino Chinese cuisine]]\n** [[Batchoy]], [[Pancit]]\n* [[Indian Chinese cuisine]]\n** [[Gobi manchurian]], [[Manchow soup]]\n* [[Indonesian Chinese cuisine]]\n** [[Bakso]], [[Cap cai]], [[Lumpia]], [[Mie goreng]], [[Swikee]]\n* [[Japanese Chinese cuisine]]\n** [[Ramen]], [[Gyoza]], [[Kakuni]], [[Tenshindon]]\n|col2 =\n* [[Korean Chinese cuisine]]\n** [[Jajangmyeon]]\n* [[Malaysian Chinese cuisine]]\n** [[Bak Kut Teh]], [[Char kway teow]], [[Yusheng|Yee sang]]\n* [[Pakistani Chinese cuisine]]\n** [[Jalfrezi]]\n* [[Peranakan cuisine]]\n** [[Fish head curry]], [[Laksa]]\n* [[Chifa|Peruvian Chinese cuisine]]\n** [[Arroz chaufa]]\n* [[Puerto Rican Chinese cuisine]]\n* [[Singaporean Chinese cuisine]]\n** [[Hainanese chicken rice]]\n}}\n\n==Dining etiquette==\n[[File:Song Dynasty silver chopsticks, cup, and spoon.JPG|thumb|Silverware from Song dynasty (10th -13th century) : Chopsticks, bowl and spoon]]\n{{Main article|Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining}}\nThe Chinese dining etiquette has that youths should not sit at the table before the elders. In addition to this, youths should not start eating before the elders start eating. When eating with a bowl, one should not hold it with its bottom part, because it resembles the act of begging. Also, when taking a break from eating at the table, one should not put the chopstick into the rice vertically, because it resembles the Chinese traditional funeral tribute, which involves putting chopstick inside a bowl of rice vertically.

A really well-cooked Chinese food would need to achieve all three of them. Also, there is teaching of food carving <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cchatty.com/article/Food-carving/ |title=Chinese food carving |publisher=cchatty |date= |accessdate=2018-01-29}}</ref> in Chinese culture, typically using vegetables as materials to carve the sculpture for animals and spiritual beings.\n\n==Relation to Chinese philosophy==\nIn Chinese philosophy, food is frequently used as the message that the author is trying to convey. A Chinese philosophy [[I Ching]] says, \u201cGentlemen use eating as a way to attain happiness.

Specific religions in China have their own cuisines such as the [[Taoist diet]], [[Buddhist cuisine]] and [[Chinese Islamic Cuisine]].

Considered a pioneer of [[modernism]], one of the most influential sculptors of the 20th-century, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i is called the patriarch of modern sculpture. As a child he displayed an aptitude for carving wooden [[farm tool]]s. Formal studies took him first to [[Bucharest]], then to [[Munich]], then to the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]] from 1905 to 1907. His art emphasizes clean [[geometry|geometrical lines]] that balance forms inherent in his materials with the [[symbolism (arts)|symbolic allusions]] of [[representational art]]. Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i sought inspiration in non-European cultures as a source of [[Primitivism|primitive]] [[exoticism]], as did [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]] and others.

Geometric patterns of the region are seen in his later works.\n\nHis parents Nicolae and Maria Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i were poor peasants who earned a meager living through back-breaking labor; from the age of seven, Constantin herded the family's flock of sheep. He showed talent for carving objects out of wood, and often ran away from home to escape the bullying of his father and older brothers.\n\nAt the age of nine, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i left the village to work in the nearest large town. At 11 he went into the service of a grocer in Slatina; and then he became a domestic in a public house in Craiova where he remained for several years. When he was 18, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i created a violin by hand with materials he found around his workplace. Impressed by Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i's talent for carving, an industrialist entered him in the Craiova School of Arts and Crafts (''\u0219coala de arte \u0219i meserii''), where he pursued his love for woodworking, graduating with honors in 1898.<ref name=brainjuice>[http://www.brain-juice.com/cgi-bin/show_bio.cgi?p_id=108 Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220115258/http://www.brain-juice.com/cgi-bin/show_bio.cgi?p_id=108 |date=2006-12-20 }} at brainjuice.com.

Exhibited in 1913 at the [[Armory Show]] and published in the ''Chicago Tribune'', 25 March 1913]]\nIn 1903, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i traveled to [[Munich]], and from there to [[Paris]]. In Paris, he was welcomed by the community of artists and intellectuals brimming with new ideas.<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/euwf/hod_1996.403.7ab.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art website]</ref> He worked for two years in the workshop of [[Antonin Merci\u00e9]] of the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]], and was invited to enter the workshop of [[Auguste Rodin]]. Even though he admired the eminent Rodin he left the Rodin studio after only two months, saying, \"Nothing can grow under big trees.\"<ref name=brainjuice/>\n\nAfter leaving Rodin's workshop, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i began developing the revolutionary style for which he is known. His first commissioned work, ''The Prayer'', was part of a gravestone memorial. It depicts a young woman crossing herself as she kneels, and marks the first step toward abstracted, non-literal representation, and shows his drive to depict \"not the outer form but the idea, the essence of things.\" He also began doing more carving, rather than the method popular with his contemporaries, that of modeling in clay or plaster which would be cast in metal, and by 1908 he worked almost exclusively by carving.\n\nIn the following few years he made many versions of ''Sleeping Muse'' and ''[[The Kiss (Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i)|The Kiss]]'', further simplifying forms to geometrical and sparse objects.\n\nHis works became popular in France, Romania and the United States. Collectors, notably [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], bought his pieces, and reviewers praised his works. In 1913 Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i's work was displayed at both the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] and the first exhibition in the U.S. of modern art, the [[Armory Show]].\n\n[[File:Edward Steichen - Brancusi's studio, 1920.jpeg|thumb|right|Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i's Paris studio, 1920, photograph by [[Edward Steichen]]]]\nIn 1920, he developed a notorious reputation with the entry of ''[[Princess X]]''<ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51035.html Philadelphia Museum of Art, ''Princess X'']</ref> in the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants|Salon]]. The phallic appearance of this large, gleaming bronze piece scandalized the Salon and, despite Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i's explanation that it was simply meant to represent the essence of womanhood, removed it from the exhibition. ''Princess X'' was revealed to be [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], direct descendant of the younger brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The sculpture has been interpreted by some as symbolizing her obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm, with the help of [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ldqAAAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=orgasm Princess Marie Bonaparte, ''De la Sexualit\u00e9 de la Femme'', Grove Press, 1962]</ref><ref>[http://www.archivesdefrance.culture.gouv.fr/action-culturelle/celebrations-nationales/recueil-2012/sciences-et-techniques/marie-bonaparte/ ''Marie Bonaparte'', Actions culturelle et p\u00e9dagogique, Comm\u00e9morations nationales, recueil 2012, Sciences et techniques, Archives de France]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/drivesaffectsbeh00loew Ryudolph Maurice Loewenstein, ed; Schur, Max, ed; Princess Marie Bonaparte, 1882-1962, ''Drives, affects, behavior'', New York,: International Universities Press]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/rroseisr00bles Jennifer Blessing; Judith Halberstam, 1961, ''Rrose is a rrose is a rrose : gender performance in photography'', 1961; Solomon R.

The works are based on his earlier ''M\u0103iastra'' series.<ref>[http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/collections/artisti/dettagli/opere_dett.php?id_art=26&id_opera=47 ''M\u0103iastra'']</ref> In Romanian folklore the M\u0103iastra is a beautiful golden bird who foretells the future and cures the blind. Over the following 20 years, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i made multiple versions of ''Bird in Space'' out of marble or bronze. [[Athena Tacha]] Spear's book, ''Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i's Birds,'' (CAA monographs XXI, NYU Press, New York, 1969), first sorted out the 36 versions and their development, from the early ''[[M\u0103iastra]]'', to the ''Golden Bird'' of the late teens, to the ''Bird in Space'', which emerged in the early 1920s and which Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i developed throughout his life.\n\nOne of these versions caused a major controversy in 1926, when photographer [[Edward Steichen]] purchased it and shipped it to the United States. Customs officers did not accept the ''Bird'' as a work of art and assessed customs duty on its import as an industrial item. After protracted court proceedings, this assessment was overturned, thus confirming the Bird's status as a duty-exempt work of art.<ref>[http://www.clubmoral.com/forcemental/16/page.php?sid=139 Force Metal ezine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621005339/http://www.clubmoral.com/forcemental/16/page.php?sid=139 |date=2006-06-21 }}</ref><ref>Tomkins, Calvin: ''Duchamp: A Biography'', pages 272, 275, 318.

Worldwide fame in 1933 brought him the commission of building a meditation temple in India for [[Maharaja]]h of [[Indore]], but when Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i went to India in 1937 to complete the plans and begin construction, the Mahrajah was away and lost interest in the project when he returned.\n\nIn 1938, he finished the [[World War I]] monument in [[T\u00e2rgu-Jiu]] where he had spent much of his childhood. ''[[Table of Silence]]'', ''[[The Gate of the Kiss]]'', and ''[[Endless Column]]'' commemorate the courage and sacrifice of Romanians who in 1916 defended T\u00e2rgu Jiu from the forces of the [[Central Powers]]. The restoration of this ensemble was spearheaded by the [[World Monuments Fund]] and was completed in 2004.\n\nThe [[Sculptural Ensemble of Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i at T\u00e2rgu Jiu|T\u00e2rgu Jiu ensemble]] marks the apex of his artistic career. In his remaining 19 years he created less than 15 pieces, mostly reworking earlier themes, and while his fame grew he withdrew. In 1955 [[Life magazine|''Life'' magazine]] reported, \"Wearing white pajamas and a yellow gnome-like cap, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i today hobbles about his studio tenderly caring for and communing with the silent host of fish, birds, heads, and endless columns which he created.\"\n\nBr\u00e2ncu\u0219i was cared for in his later years by a Romanian refugee couple. He became a French citizen in 1952 in order to make the caregivers his heirs, and to bequeath his studio and its contents to the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]] in Paris.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Brancusi, Roche, Satie & Foster 1923.jpg|thumb|right|200px|left|Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i (left) with [[Henri-Pierre Roch\u00e9]], [[Erik Satie]] and [[Jeanne Robert Foster]] playing golf in 1923]]\n\nBr\u00e2ncu\u0219i always dressed in the simple ways the Romanian peasants did. His studio was reminiscent of the houses of the peasants from his native region: there was a big slab of rock as a table and a primitive fireplace, similar to those found in traditional houses in his native [[Oltenia]], while the rest of the furniture was made by him out of wood.

He was a saint-like idealist and near ascetic, turning his workshop into a place where visitors noted the deep spiritual atmosphere. However, particularly through the 1910s and 1920s, he was known as a [[hedonism|pleasure seeker]] and merrymaker in his [[bohemianism|bohemian]] circle. He enjoyed cigarettes, good wine, and the company of women. He had one child, John Moore, with the New Zealand pianist [[Vera Moore]], whom he never acknowledged.<ref name=brainjuice/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1686039 |title= Constantin Brancusi (1876-1957) |publisher= [[Christie's]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/11955/lot/98/|title=Bonhams : Alfred Wallis (1855-1942) Two boats 10 x 14 cm.

One of these, constructed in 1925 using wood, stone, and marble (Richler 178) stands around 72&nbsp;inches tall and consists of a narrow feather standing erect on a wooden base. Similar models, but made from materials such as bronze, were also produced by Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i and placed in exhibitions.\n\n''Sleeping Muse I'' has different versions as well; one, from 1909\u201310, is made of marble and measures 6 \u00be in. in height (Adams 549). This is a model of a head, without a body, with markings to show features such as hair, nose, lips, and closed eyes. In ''A History of Western Art'', Adams says that the sculpture has \"an abstract, curvilinear quality and a smooth contour that create an impression of elegance\" (549).

Its actions went as far as political assassination.<ref>{{YouTube|oG24vg8js4o}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to the Church Committee:\n<blockquote>While the declared purposes of these programs were to protect the \"national security\" or prevent violence, Bureau witnesses admit that many of the targets were nonviolent and most had no connections with a foreign power. Indeed, nonviolent organizations and individuals were targeted because the Bureau believed they represented a \"potential\" for violence\u2014and nonviolent citizens who were against the war in Vietnam were targeted because they gave \"aid and comfort\" to violent demonstrators by lending respectability to their cause.\n\nThe imprecision of the targeting is demonstrated by the inability of the Bureau to define the subjects of the programs. The Black Nationalist program, according to its supervisor, included \"a great number of organizations that you might not today characterize as black nationalist but which were in fact primarily black.\" Thus, the nonviolent Southern Christian Leadership Conference was labeled as a Black Nationalist-\"Hate Group.\"\n\nFurthermore, the actual targets were chosen from a far broader group than the titles of the programs would imply. The CPUSA program targeted not only Communist Party members but also sponsors of the [[National Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee]] and civil rights leaders allegedly under Communist influence or deemed to be not sufficiently \"anti-Communist\". The Socialist Workers Party program included non-SWP sponsors of anti-war demonstrations which were cosponsored by the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance, its youth group. The Black Nationalist program targeted a range of organizations from the Panthers to SNCC to the peaceful Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and included every Black Student Union and many other black student groups. New Left targets ranged from the SDS to the InterUniversity Committee for Debate on Foreign Policy, from [[Antioch College]] (\"vanguard of the New Left\") to the New Mexico Free University and other \"alternate\" schools, and from underground newspapers to students' protesting university censorship of a student publication by carrying signs with four-letter words on them.</blockquote>\n\nExamples of surveillance, spanning all presidents from FDR to Nixon, both legal and illegal, contained in the Church Committee report:<ref>[https://my.ilstu.edu/~jkshapi/COINTELPRO.S.pdf Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans, Final Report of the Senate Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Activities]</ref>\n\n* [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] asked the FBI to put in its files the names of citizens sending telegrams to the White House opposing his \"national defense\" policy and supporting Col.

In letter writing campaigns (wherein false letters were sent on behalf of members of parties), the FBI ensured that groups would not unite in their causes. For instance they, launched a campaign specifically to alienate the Black Panther Party from the Mau Maus, Young Lords, Young Patriots and SDS. These racially diverse groups had been building alliances, in part due to charismatic leaders such as Fred Hampton and his attempts to create a \"Rainbow Coalition\". The FBI was concerned with ensuring that groups could not gain traction through unity, specifically across racial lines. One of the main ways of targeting these groups was to arouse suspicion between the different parties and causes. In this way the bureau took on a divide and conquer offensive.<ref name=Churchill_1990/>\n\nThe COINTELPRO documents show numerous cases of the FBI's intentions to prevent and disrupt protests against the [[Vietnam War]]. Many techniques were used to accomplish this task. \"These included promoting splits among antiwar forces, encouraging [[red-baiting]] of socialists, and pushing violent confrontations as an alternative to massive, peaceful demonstrations.\" One 1966 COINTELPRO operation tried to redirect the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] from their pledge of support for the antiwar movement.<ref>Blackstock, Nelson.

Their main purpose was to discredit, disrupt and negatively redirect action. Their very presence served to undermine trust and scare off potential supporters. The FBI and police exploited this fear to smear genuine activists as agents.\n# '''Psychological warfare:''' The FBI and police used myriad \"dirty tricks\" to undermine progressive movements. They planted false media stories and published bogus leaflets and other publications in the name of targeted groups. They forged correspondence, sent anonymous letters, and made anonymous telephone calls. They spread misinformation about meetings and events, set up pseudo movement groups run by government agents, and manipulated or strong-armed parents, employers, landlords, school officials and others to cause trouble for activists. They used [[bad-jacketing]] to create suspicion about targeted activists, sometimes with lethal consequences.<ref>{{Citation\n    |publisher = South End Press\n    |isbn = 978-0896086463\n    |title = Agents of Repression\n    |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL25433596M/Agents_of_Repression_The_FBI's_Secret_Wars_Against_the_Black_Panther_Party_and_the_American_Indian_M\n    |author = Ward Churchill\n    |edition = Agents of Repression: The FBI's Secret Wars Against the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement\n    |publication-date = 2002\n    |oclc = 50985124\n    |id = 0896086461\n    }}</ref>\n# '''Harassment via the legal system:''' The FBI and police abused the legal system to harass dissidents and make them appear to be criminals. Officers of the law gave perjured testimony and presented fabricated evidence as a pretext for false arrests and wrongful imprisonment. They discriminatorily enforced tax laws and other government regulations and used conspicuous surveillance, \"investigative\" interviews, and grand jury subpoenas in an effort to intimidate activists and silence their supporters.<ref name=\"icdc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIIc.htm|title=The FBI'S Covert Action Program to Destroy the Black Panther Party|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book3/html/ChurchB3_0001a.htm|title=Assassination Archive and Research Center|publisher=}}</ref>\n# '''Illegal force:''' The FBI conspired with local police departments to threaten dissidents; to conduct illegal break-ins in order to search dissident homes; and to commit vandalism, assaults, beatings and assassinations.<ref name=\"icdc.com\"/> The objective was to frighten or eliminate dissidents and disrupt their movements.\n# '''Undermine public opinion:''' One of the primary ways the FBI targeted organizations was by challenging their reputations in the community and denying them a platform to gain legitimacy. Hoover specifically designed programs to block leaders from \"spreading their philosophy publicly or through the communications media\". Furthermore, the organization created and controlled negative media meant to undermine black power organizations. For instance, they oversaw the creation of \"documentaries\" skillfully edited to paint the Black Panther Party as aggressive, and false newspapers that spread misinformation about party members. The ability of the FBI to create distrust within and between revolutionary organizations tainted their public image and weakened chances at unity and public support.<ref name=Churchill_1990/>\n\nThe FBI specifically developed tactics intended to heighten tension and hostility between various factions in the black power movement, for example between the Black Panthers and the [[US Organization]]. For instance, the FBI sent a fake letter to the US Organization exposing a supposed Black Panther plot to murder the head of the US Organization, Ron Karenga. They then intensified this by spreading falsely attributed cartoons in the black communities pitting the Black Panther Party against the US Organization.<ref name=Churchill_1990/> This resulted in numerous deaths, among which were San Diego Black Panther Party members John Huggins, Bunchy Carter and Sylvester Bell.<ref name=\"icdc.com\"/> Another example of the FBI's annonymous letter writing campaign is how they turned the Blackstone Rangers head, Jeff Fort, against former ally Fred Hampton, by stating that Hampton had a hit on Fort.<ref name=Churchill_1990/> They also were instrumental in developing the rift between Black Panther Party leaders Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton, as executed through false letters inciting the two leaders of the Black Panther Party.<ref name=Churchill_1990/>\n\n[[Dhoruba al-Mujahid bin Wahad|Dhoruba Bin Wahad]] a former Black Panther, reflects on how these tactics made him feel, saying he had a combat mentality and felt like he was at war with the government. When asked about why he thinks the Black Panthers were targeted he said, \"In the United States, the equivalent of the military was the local police. During the early sixties, at the height of the civil rights movement, and the human rights movement, the police in the United States became increasingly militaristic. They began to train out of military bases in the United States. The Law Enforcement Assistance Act supplied local police with military technology, everything from assault rifles to army personnel carriers. In his opinion, the Counterintelligence Program went hand-in-hand with the militarization of the police in the Black community, with the militarization of police in America.\"<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Dhoruba al-Mujahid bin Wahad |last=Bin Wahad |first=Dhoruba |authorlink2=Mumia Abu-Jamal |first2=Mumia |last2=Abu-Jamal |first3=Assata |last3=Shakur |authorlink3=Assata Shakur |title=Still Black, Still Strong |publisher=[[Semiotext(e)]] |date=1993 |pages=18\u201319 |isbn=978-0936756745}}</ref>\n\nThe FBI also conspired with the police departments of many U.S. cities (San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Philadelphia, Chicago) to encourage repeated raids on Black Panther homes\u2014often with little or no evidence of violations of federal, state, or local laws\u2014which resulted directly in the police killing many members of the Black Panther Party, most notably Chicago Black Panther Party Chairman [[Fred Hampton]] on December 4, 1969.<ref name=\"icdc.com\"/><ref name=\"FBI Secrets 1995\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Elaine |title=A Taste of Power: A Black Woman's Story |publisher=New York: Doubleday |date=1992 |pages=204\u201306 |isbn=978-0385471077}}</ref> Before the death of Hampton long-term infiltrator, William O'Neal, shared floor plans of his apartment with the COINTELPRO team.

The Government has often undertaken the secret surveillance of citizens on the basis of their political beliefs, even when those beliefs posed no threat of violence or illegal acts on behalf of a hostile foreign power. The Government, operating primarily through secret and biased informants, but also using other intrusive techniques such as wiretaps, microphone \"bugs\", surreptitious mail opening, and break-ins, has swept in vast amounts of information about the personal lives, views, and associations of [[American citizen]]s. Investigations of groups deemed potentially dangerous\u2014and even of groups suspected of associating with potentially dangerous organizations\u2014have continued for decades, despite the fact that those groups did not engage in unlawful activity.\n\nGroups and individuals have been assaulted, repressed, harassed and disrupted because of their political views, social beliefs and their lifestyles. Investigations have been based upon vague standards whose breadth made excessive collection inevitable. Unsavory, harmful and vicious tactics have been employed\u2014including anonymous attempts to break up marriages, disrupt meetings, ostracize persons from their professions, and provoke target groups into rivalries that might result in deaths. Intelligence agencies have served the political and personal objectives of presidents and other high officials. While the agencies often committed excesses in response to pressure from high officials in the Executive branch and Congress, they also occasionally initiated improper activities and then concealed them from officials whom they had a duty to inform.\n\nGovernmental officials\u2014including those whose principal duty is to enforce the law\u2014have violated or ignored the law over long periods of time and have advocated and defended their right to break the law.\n\nThe Constitutional system of checks and balances has not adequately controlled intelligence activities. Until recently the Executive branch has neither delineated the scope of permissible activities nor established procedures for supervising intelligence agencies. Congress has failed to exercise sufficient oversight, seldom questioning the use to which its appropriations were being put. Most domestic intelligence issues have not reached the courts, and in those cases when they have reached the courts, the judiciary has been reluctant to grapple with them.<ref name=\"Church\">{{cite web|title=Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans Book II, Final Report of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Activities United States Senate (Church Committee)|publisher=United States Senate|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIa.htm|accessdate=May 11, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019170937/http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIa.htm|archivedate=October 19, 2006|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"Slate\">{{cite web|title=Tapped Out Why Congress won't get through to the NSA.|work=Slate |date=February 2, 2006 |author=Patrick Radden Keefe |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2135325/|accessdate=May 11, 2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Post-COINTELPRO operations==\nWhile COINTELPRO was officially terminated in April 1971, domestic espionage continued.<ref>Bud Schultz, Ruth Schultz.

Cruise missiles are designed to deliver a large [[warhead]] over long distances with high precision. Modern cruise missiles are capable of travelling at [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] or high [[Aerodynamics#Incompressible aerodynamics|subsonic]] speeds, are self-navigating, and are able to fly on a non-[[Ballistics|ballistic]], extremely low-altitude trajectory.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Fieseler Fi-103.jpg|thumb|A Fieseler Fi-103, the German [[V-1 flying bomb]]]]\nThe idea of an \"aerial torpedo\" was shown in the British 1909 film ''[[The Airship Destroyer]]'', where flying torpedoes controlled wirelessly are used to bring down airships bombing London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/rpav_britain.html |title=Remote Piloted Aerial Vehicles : The 'Aerial Target' and 'Aerial Torpedo' in Britain |publisher=Ctie.monash.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1916, [[Lawrence Sperry]] built and patented an \"aerial torpedo\", the [[Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane]], a small biplane carrying a TNT charge, a Sperry [[autopilot]] and a barometric altitude control. Inspired by these experiments, the United States Army developed a similar flying bomb called the [[Kettering Bug]]. Germany had also flown trials with remote-controlled aerial gliders ''(Torpedogleiter)'' built by Siemens-Schuckert beginning in 1916.<ref>Roger Branfill-Cook, \"Torpedo\", Seaforth Publishing, Great Britain 2014</ref>\n\nIn the period between the World Wars the [[United Kingdom]] developed the [[RAE Larynx|Larynx (Long Range Gun with Lynx Engine)]], which underwent a few flight tests in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/twcruz_1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813001620/http://www.vectorsite.net/twcruz_1.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 August 2007|title=[1.0] The Aerial Torpedo|date=13 August 2007|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], [[Sergei Korolev]] headed the [[Group for the Study of Reactive Motion|GIRD]]-06 cruise missile project from 1932 to 1939, which used a rocket-powered boost-[[glide bomb]] design. The 06/III (RP-216) and 06/IV (RP-212) contained gyroscopic guidance systems.<ref>\"Object No. 212\", 1936 report in _Tvorcheskoi Nasledie Akedemika Sergeya Pavlovicha Koroleva_</ref> The vehicle was designed to boost to 28&nbsp;km altitude and glide a distance of 280&nbsp;km, but test flights in 1934 and 1936 only reached an altitude of 500 meters.\n\nIn 1944, [[Germany]] deployed the first operational cruise missiles in [[World War II]]. The [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]], often called a [[flying bomb]], contained a [[gyroscope]] guidance system and was propelled by a simple [[pulsejet]] engine, the sound of which gave it the nickname of \"buzz bomb\" or \"doodlebug\". Accuracy was sufficient only for use against very large targets (the general area of a city), while the range of 250&nbsp;km was significantly lower than that of a bomber carrying the same payload. The main advantages were speed (while not sufficient to outperform contemporary interceptors) and expendability. The production cost of a V-1 was only a small fraction of that of a [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] [[ballistic missile]], carrying a similar-sized warhead.<ref>Side note: Both missiles were manufactured under the heavy use of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|Nazi slave labour]].</ref> Unlike the V-2, however, the initial deployments of the V-1 required stationary launch ramps which were susceptible to bombardment. Nazi Germany, in 1943, also developed the [[Mistel]] [[composite aircraft]] program, which can be seen as a rudimentary air-launched cruise missile, where a piloted fighter-type aircraft was mounted atop an unpiloted bomber-sized aircraft that was packed with explosives to be released while approaching the target. Bomber-launched variants of the V-1 saw limited operational service near the end of the war, with the pioneering V-1's design reverse-engineered by the Americans as the [[Republic-Ford JB-2]] cruise missile.\n\nImmediately after the war the [[United States Air Force]] had 21 different guided missile projects, including would-be cruise missiles. All but four were cancelled by 1948,&nbsp;\u2014 the [[Air Materiel Command]] [[BANSHEE]], the [[SM-62 Snark]], the [[SM-64 Navaho]], and the [[MGM-1 Matador]]. The BANSHEE design was similar to [[Operation Aphrodite]]; like Aphrodite, it failed, and was cancelled in April 1949.<ref>[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA162646 The Evolution of the Cruise Missile by Werrell, Kenneth P.] see PDF page 92 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304213844/http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA162646 |date=4 March 2007 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] experimented further with the concept, deploying early cruise missiles from land, submarines and aircraft. The main outcome of the United States Navy submarine missile project was the [[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] missile, based upon the V-1.\n\nThe United States Air Force's first operational surface-to-surface missile was the winged, mobile, nuclear-capable [[MGM-1 Matador]], also similar in concept to the V-1. Deployment overseas began in 1954, first to West Germany and later to the Republic of China (Taiwan) and South Korea. On 7 November 1956, U.S. Air Force deployed Matador units in West Germany, whose missiles were capable of striking targets in the Warsaw Pact, from their fixed day-to-day sites to unannounced dispersed launch locations. This alert was in response to the crisis posed by the Soviet attack on Hungary which suppressed the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].\n\nBetween 1957 and 1961 the United States followed an ambitious and well-funded program to develop a nuclear-powered cruise missile, [[Supersonic Low Altitude Missile]] (SLAM). It was designed to fly below the enemy's radar at speeds above [[Mach number|Mach]] 3 and carry a number of [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]] that it would drop along its path over enemy territory. Although the concept was proven sound and the 500 [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatt]] engine finished a successful test run in 1961, no airworthy device was ever completed. The project was finally abandoned in favor of [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] development.\n\nWhile [[ballistic missile]]s were the preferred weapons for land targets, heavy nuclear and [[conventional weapon]] tipped cruise missiles were seen by the USSR as a primary weapon to destroy United States naval [[carrier battle group]]s. Large submarines (for example, [[Echo-class submarine|Echo]] and [[Oscar-class submarine|Oscar]] classes) were developed to carry these weapons and shadow United States battle groups at sea, and large bombers (for example, [[Tupolev Tu-22M|Backfire]], [[Tupolev Tu-95|Bear]], and [[Tupolev Tu-160|Blackjack]] models) were equipped with the weapons in their air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) configuration.\n\n==General design==\nCruise missiles generally consist of a [[guidance system]], payload, and [[aircraft propulsion]] system, housed in an [[airframe]] with small wings and [[empennage]] for flight control. Payloads usually consist of a conventional warhead or a [[Nuclear Weapon|nuclear warhead]]. Cruise missiles tend to be propelled by a [[jet engine]], [[turbofan]] engines being preferred due to their greater efficiency at low altitude and subsonic speed.\n\n===Guidance systems===\n{{Main article|Missile guidance}}\nGuidance systems also vary greatly. Low-cost systems use a [[radar altimeter]], barometric altimeter and [[clock]] to navigate a [[Digital data|digital]] strip [[map]]. More advanced systems use [[inertial guidance]], [[satellite guidance]] and [[TERCOM|terrain contour matching (TERCOM)]]. Use of an [[automatic target recognition|automatic target recognition (ATR)]] algorithm/device in the guidance system increases accuracy of the missile. The [[Standoff Land Attack Missile]] features an ATR unit from [[General Electric]].\n\n==Categories==\nCruise missiles can be categorized by size, speed (subsonic or supersonic), and range, and whether launched from land, air, surface ship, or submarine. Often versions of the same missile are produced for different launch platforms; sometimes air- and submarine-launched versions are a little lighter and smaller than land- and ship-launched versions.\n\nGuidance systems can vary across missiles. Some missiles can be fitted with any of a variety of navigation systems ([[Inertial navigation]], [[TERCOM]], or [[satellite navigation]]).

Both missile types are configurable for either conventional or nuclear warheads.\n\nBoth [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] (as BGM-109) and ALCM (AGM-86) were competing designs for the USAF.

The truck-launched versions, and also the Pershing II and SS-20 Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles, were later destroyed under the bilateral INF (Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces) treaty with the USSR.\n\nThe British [[Royal Navy]] (RN) also operates cruise missiles, specifically the U.S.-made Tomahawk, used by the RN's nuclear submarine fleet. UK conventional warhead versions were first fired in combat by the RN in 1999, during the [[Kosovo War]] (the United States fired cruise missiles in 1991). The [[Royal Air Force]] uses the [[Storm Shadow]] cruise missile on its [[Tornado GR4]] aircraft. It is also used by France, where it is known as SCALP EG, and carried by the [[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]'s [[Mirage 2000]] and [[Rafale]] aircraft.\n\n[[India]] and [[Russia]] have jointly developed the supersonic cruise missile [[BrahMos]]. There are three versions of the Brahmos: ship/land-launched, air-launched and sub-launched. The ship/land-launched version were operational as of late 2007. The Brahmos has the capability to attack targets on land. Russia also continues to operate other cruise missiles: the [[SS-N-12 Sandbox]], [[SS-N-19 Shipwreck]], [[SS-N-22 Sunburn]] and [[Kh-35|SS-N-25 Switchblade]]. [[Germany]] and [[Spain]] operate the [[KEPD 350|Taurus missile]] while [[Pakistan]] has copied the [[US]] supplied [[Harpoon_(missile)|Harpoon missile]] and made [[Babur missile]].

One consequence of this is that its users face difficult choices in [[targeting (warfare)|target allocation]], to avoid expending the missiles on targets of low value. For instance during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] the United States attacked targets of very low monetary value with cruise missiles, which led many to question the efficiency of the weapon. However, proponents of the cruise missile counter that the same argument applies to other types of [[unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s: they are cheaper than human pilots when total training and infrastructure costs are taken into account, not to mention the risk of loss of personnel. As demonstrated in [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]] and prior conflicts, cruise missiles are much more difficult to detect and intercept than other aerial assets (reduced radar cross-section, infrared and visual signature due to smaller size), suiting them to attacks against static air defense systems.  The development of hypersonic missiles systems is, however, problematic from a geopolitical perspective. In an article on this topic, Professor [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] warned that a test ban is very unlikely and that the technology will renew a strategic arms race and geopolitical rivalries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/11/hypersonic-missiles-and-global-security/|title=Hypersonic Missiles and Global Security|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Affordable Weapon System]]\n* [[Cruise missile submarine]]\n* [[Eugene Vielle]] (pioneer of technology that led to the Cruise missile)\n* [[Expendable launch system]]\n* [[List of cruise missiles]]\n* [[List of rocket aircraft]]\n* [[Lists of weapons]]\n* [[Low Cost Miniature Cruise Missile]]\n* [[NATO reporting name]] (has lists of various Soviet missiles)\n* [[Weapon of mass destruction]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons}}\n*[http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA162646 The Evolution of the Cruise Missile by Werrell, Kenneth P.]\n*[http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1981/jan-feb/werrell.htm The Cruise Missile: Precursors and Problems by Werrell, Kenneth P.]\n*[https://fas.org/nuke/intro/cm/index.html An introduction to cruise missiles]&nbsp;\u2014 From the website of the Federation of American Scientists (FAS)\n*[https://fas.org/irp/threat/missile/ADA377356.pdf Feasibility of Third World Advanced Ballistic & Cruise Missile Threat] NDIA 155 slide presentation from 1999\n*[http://www.aardvark.co.nz/pjet/cruise.shtml The DIY cruise missile]\n*[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/W80.html The W80 Warhead]\n*[http://www.ausairpower.net/TE-Cruise-Missiles-1985.html Cruise Missile Fundamentals]\n*[http://www.ausairpower.net/Tomahawk-Subtypes.html Tomahawk Variants]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060714202014/http://www.strategycenter.net/research/pubID.112/pub_detail.asp Bypassing the NMD: China and the Cruise Missile Proliferation Problem (Kh-55)]\n*[http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6e0f843efd Video of cruise missile formation over Iraq]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140316064525/http://skilligent.com/products/robot-navigation.shtml A commercial terrain matching image-based navigation system (with video)]\n\n{{Missile types}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cruise Missile}}\n[[Category:Cruise missiles| ]]\n[[Category:Missile types]]", "sha1": "s3s1fd9narj4bm29skl2m6qttgazx6h"}}, {"title": "Crete", "ns": "0", "id": "6591", "revision": {"id": "866275183", "parentid": "866272747", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T11:05:02Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ghmyrtle", "id": "1698793"}, "comment": "/* See also */ hard to see direct relevance to this article", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses|Crete (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}\n{{Infobox islands\n| name             = Crete\n| native name      = \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\n| native name link = Greek language\n| native_name_lang = el\n| sobriquet        = <!-- or |nickname= -->\n| image name       = Island of Crete, Greece.JPG\n| image size       =\n| image caption    = [[NASA]] photograph of Crete\n| image alt        =\n| map image        = Kriti in Greece.svg\n| map alt          =\n| map size         =\n| map caption      =\n| coordinates      = {{Coord|35|12.6|N|24|54.6|E|scale:5000000|display=inline,title}}\n| etymology        =\n| location         = [[Eastern Mediterranean]]\n| archipelago      =\n| waterbody        =\n| total islands    =\n| major islands    =\n| area km2         = 8303\n| area footnotes   =\n| rank             = 88\n| length km        = <!-- or |length m=  -->\n| length footnotes =\n| width km         = <!-- or |width m=  -->\n| width footnotes  =\n| coastline km     = <!-- or |coastline m=  -->\n| coastline footnotes =\n| elevation m      = 2456\n| elevation footnotes =\n| highest mount    = [[Mount Ida (Crete)|Mount Ida]] (Psiloritis)\n| country          = {{Flag|Greece}}\n| country admin divisions title     = [[Administrative regions of Greece|Region]]\n| country admin divisions           = [[#Administration|Crete]]\n| country capital                   = [[Heraklion]]\n| country largest city              = Heraklion\n| country largest city population   = 224,253\n| demonym          = Cretan ([[Greeks|Greek]])\n| population       = 623,065\n| population as of = 2011\n| population footnotes =\n| population rank = 73\n| population rank max =\n| density km2      = 75\n| density rank     =\n| density footnotes =\n| ethnic groups    =\n| timezone1        =\n| utc_offset1      =\n| timezone1_DST    =\n| utc_offset1_DST  =\n| website          =\n}}\n\n'''Crete''' ({{lang-el|\u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7}}, ''{{transl|el|Kr\u00edti}}'' {{IPA-el|'kriti|}};

A small sample of the islands includes:\n*[[Gramvousa]] ([[Kissamos]], [[Chania]]) the pirate island opposite the Balo lagoon\n*[[Elafonisi]] ([[Chania]]), which commemorates a shipwreck and an Ottoman massacre\n*[[Chrysi (island)|Chrysi]] island ([[Ierapetra]], [[Lasithi]]), which hosts the largest natural [[Cedrus libani|Lebanon cedar]] forest in Europe\n*[[Paximadia]] island (Agia Galini, [[Rethymno]]) where the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis were born\n*The Venetian fort and leper colony at [[Spinalonga]] opposite the beach and shallow waters of [[Elounda]] ([[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]], Lasithi)\n*[[Dionysades]] islands which are in an environmentally protected region together the Palm Beach Forest of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]] in the municipality of [[Sitia]], Lasithi\n\nOff the south coast, the island of [[Gavdos]] is located {{convert|26|nmi|km|0}} south of [[Hora Sfakion]] and is the [[Extreme points of Europe|southernmost]] point of [[Europe]].\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Greece}}\nCrete straddles two climatic zones, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the [[North African]], mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]. The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low-lying areas. While some mountain tops are snow-capped for most of the year, near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours. However, a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004, during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow. During the Cretan summer, average temperatures reach the high 20s-low 30s Celsius (mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), with maxima touching the upper 30s-mid 40s.\n\nThe south coast, including the [[Mesara Plain]] and [[Asterousia Mountains]], falls in the [[North Africa]]n climatic zone, and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, [[date palm]]s bear fruit, and [[Swallow (bird)|swallows]] remain year-round rather than migrate to [[Africa]]. The fertile region around [[Ierapetra]], on the southeastern corner of the island, is renowned for its exceptional year-round agricultural production, with all kinds of summer vegetables and fruit produced in [[greenhouse]]s throughout the winter.<ref>Rackham, O. & Moody, J., 1996.

However, agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3vxvYOZkj4C&pg=PR11&dq=economy+Crete&hl=en#v=onepage&q=economy%20Crete&f=false The rough guide to Crete, Introduction, p. ix] by J. Fisher and G. Garvey.</ref> The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, because of the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, whereas unemployment is at approximately 4%, one-sixth of that of the country overall.\n\nAs in many regions of Greece, [[viticulture]] and [[olive]] groves are significant; [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[Greek citron|citrons]] are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as [[mizithra]], [[anthotyros]], and [[kefalotyri]].\n\n===Transport infrastructure===\n[[File:Kreta - Europastra\u00dfe75 2.jpg|thumb|[[European route E75]] near [[Heraklion]]]]\n\nThe island has three significant airports, [[Heraklion International Airport, \"Nikos Kazantzakis\"|Nikos Kazantzakis]] at [[Heraklion]], the [[Chania International Airport|Daskalogiannis]] airport at [[Chania]] and a [[Sitia Public Airport|smaller one]] in [[Sitia]]. The first two serve international routes, acting as the main gateways to the island for travellers.  There is a long-standing plan to replace Heraklion airport with a completely new airport at Kastelli, where there is presently an air force base.\n\nThe island is well served by ferries, mostly from [[Athens]], by ferry companies such as [[Minoan Lines]] and [[ANEK Lines]].\n\nAlthough the road network leads almost everywhere, there is a lack of modern highways, although this is gradually changing with the completion of the northern coastal spine highway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/projects/greece/new-road-in-crete-set-to-improve-journey-times-and-safety|title=New road in Crete set to improve journey times and safety-Projects|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}</ref>\n\nAlso, during the 1930s there was a narrow-gauge industrial railway in Heraklion, from Giofyros in the west side of the city to the port.  There are now no railway lines on Crete. The government is planning the construction of a line from Chania to Heraklion via Rethymno.<ref name=\"books.google.gr\">Rackham, O. & Moody, J., 1996.

A number of city states developed in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]]. There was very limited contact with mainland Greece, and [[Greek historiography]] shows little interest in Crete, so that there are very few literary sources.\n\nDuring the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete was comparatively free from warfare. The [[Gortyn code]] (5th century BC) is evidence for how codified [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights.\n\nIn the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, [[Gortyn]], Kydonia ([[Chania]]), [[Lyctus|Lyttos]] and [[Polyrrhenia]] challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos.\n\nWhile the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like [[Macedon]] and its rivals [[Rhodes]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a [[Lyttian War|war between two opposing coalitions of cities]]. As a result, the Macedonian king [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] gained [[hegemony]] over Crete which lasted to the end of the [[Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC)]], when the [[Rhodes|Rhodians]] opposed the rise of Macedon and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] started to interfere in Cretan affairs.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC Ierapytna ([[Ierapetra]]) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.\n\n===Roman rule===\n{{Main|Crete and Cyrenaica}}\nCrete was involved in the [[Mithridatic Wars]], initially repelling an attack by Roman general [[Marcus Antonius Creticus]] in 71&nbsp;BC. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus (died 55&nbsp;BC)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69&nbsp;BC, earning for Metellus the title \"''Creticus''\". [[Gortyn]] was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with [[Cyrenaica]] that was called [[Creta et Cyrenaica]]. When Diocletian redivided the Empire, Crete was placed, along with Cyrene, under the diocese of Moesia, and later by Constantine I to the diocese of Macedonia.\n\n===Byzantine Empire \u2013 first period===\n{{Main|Byzantine Crete}}\n\n[[File:Crete MoniArkadiou1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|[[Arkadi Monastery]]]]\n\nCrete was separated from Cyrenaica {{circa|297}}. It remained a province within the eastern half of the Roman Empire, usually referred to as the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the establishment of a second capital in Constantinople by Constantine in 330. Crete was subjected to an attack by [[Vandals]] in 467, the great earthquakes of [[365 Crete earthquake|365]] and 415, a raid by [[Slavs]] in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century.

Many among them were [[crypto-Christians]] who converted back to Christianity in subsequent years, while many [[Cretan Turks]] fled Crete because of the unrest, settling in Turkey, Rhodes, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. By 1900, 11% of the population was Muslim. Those remaining were relocated in the 1924 [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].\n\nDuring Easter of 1770, a notable revolt against Ottoman rule, in Crete, was started by [[Daskalogiannis]], a shipowner from [[Sfakia]] who was promised support by [[Orlov Revolt|Orlov's fleet]] which never arrived. Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities. Today, the airport at Chania is named after him.\n\nCrete was left out of the modern Greek state by the [[London Protocol of 1830]], and soon it was yielded to [[Egypt]] by the Ottoman [[sultan]]. Egyptian rule was short-lived and sovereignty was returned to the Ottoman Empire by the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]] on 3 July 1840.\n\nHeraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, \"the deserted city\".<ref name=\"Greene\"/> The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach.<ref name=\"Greene\"/> The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of [[real-estate]] transactions during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In the deserted city, minorities received equal rights in purchasing property. Christians and Jews were also able to buy and sell in the real-estate market.\n\nThe [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u201369)|Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869]] or Great Cretan Revolution ({{lang-el|links=no|\u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1866}}) was a three-year uprising against Ottoman rule, the third and largest in a series of revolts between the end of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1830 and the establishment of the independent Cretan State in 1898. A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the ''Holocaust of Arkadi''. The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the [[Arkadi Monastery]], which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. In addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monastery's vaults, causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there.\n\n===Cretan State 1898\u20131908===\n{{Main|Cretan State|Theriso revolt|Candia massacre}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[File:Revolutionnaires therissos.jpg|thumb|Revolutionaries at [[Theriso]]]]\n\nFollowing the repeated uprisings in 1841, 1858, 1889, 1895 and 1897 by the Cretan people, who wanted to join Greece, the [[Great powers#History|Great Powers]] decided to restore order and in February 1897 sent in troops. The island was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia; Germany and Austro-Hungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898. During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers. In March 1898 the Powers decreed, with the very reluctant consent of the Sultan, that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman [[suzerainity]] in the near future.<ref>Pinar Senisik, ''The Transformation of Ottoman Crete, Revolts, Politics and Identity in the Late Nineteenth century'' p. 165. I. B. Tauris, 2011.</ref>\n\nIn September 1898 an outbreak of rioting in Candia, modern Heraklion, left over 500 Cretan Christians, and 14 British servicemen, dead. As a result, the Admirals ordered the expulsion of all Ottoman troops and administrators from the island, a move that was ultimately completed by early November. The decision to grant autonomy to the island was enforced and a High Commissioner, [[Prince George of Greece]], appointed, arriving to take up his post in December 1898.<ref name=Holland>Robert Holland and Diane Markides, ''The British and the Hellenes: Struggles for Mastery in the Eastern Mediterranean 1850\u20131960''. p. 81.

In 1908, taking advantage of domestic turmoil in Turkey as well as the timing of Zaimis's vacation away from the island, the Cretan deputies unilaterally declared union with Greece.

As a result of the fierce resistance from Allied forces and Cretan locals, [[Adolf Hitler]] forbade further large-scale [[paratroop]] operations. During the initial and subsequent occupation, German firing squads routinely executed male civilians in reprisal for the death of German soldiers; civilians were rounded up randomly in local villages for the mass killings, such as at the [[Massacre of Kondomari]] and the [[Viannos massacres]].

As a result, the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and poisonous snakes, to the labour of [[Hercules]] (who took a live Cretan bull to the [[Peloponnese]]). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of [[Zeus]] by removing all \"harmful\" and \"poisonous\" animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the [[Apostle Paul]], who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings.

The [[Paximadia]] islands were the birthplace of the goddess [[Artemis]] and the god [[Apollo]]. Their mother, the goddess [[Leto]], was worshipped at [[Phaistos]]. The goddess [[Athena]] bathed in Lake Voulismeni. The ancient Greek god [[Zeus]] launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the island of [[Dia (island)|Dia]]. The island can be seen from Knossos and it has the shape of a giant lizard. The islets of [[Souda (island)|Lefkai]] were the result of a musical contest between the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s and the [[Muses]]. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at [[Aptera, Greece|Aptera]] (\"featherless\") where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of [[Souda (island)|Souda]] and [[Leon (Souda Bay)|Leon]]).<ref>Caroline M.

[[Icarus]] and [[Daedalus]] were captives of [[King Minos]] and crafted wings to escape. After his death [[King Minos]] became a judge of the dead in [[Hades]], while [[Rhadamanthys]] became the ruler of the Elysian fields.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Greece}}\n{{See also|Cretan School|Cretan literature|Music of Crete|Cretan cuisine}}\n\nCrete has its own distinctive [[Mantinada|Mantinades]] poetry. The island is known for its Mantinades-based [[Music of Crete|music]] (typically performed with the [[Lyra (Cretan)|Cretan lyra]] and the [[laouto]]) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the [[Pentozali]].\n\nCretan authors have made important contributions to [[Greek Literature]] throughout the modern period; major names include [[Vikentios Kornaros]], creator of the 17th-century epic romance ''[[Erotokritos]]'' (Greek \u0395\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), and, in the 20th century, [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]. In the Renaissance, Crete was the home of the [[Cretan School]] of icon painting, which influenced [[El Greco]] and through him subsequent European painting.\nCrete is also famous for its traditional cuisine. The nutritional value of the Cretan cuisine was discovered by the American epidemiologist [[Ancel Keys]] in the 1960, being later often mentioned by epidemiologists as one of the best examples of the Mediterranean diet.<ref>Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Marques da Silva, ''[http://www.editions-harmattan.fr/index.asp?navig=catalogue&obj=livre&no=47265 La di\u00e8te m\u00e9diterran\u00e9enne.

They are one of the [[List of islands of Greece|island groups]] which constitute the Aegean [[archipelago]]. The name refers to the islands ''around'' (\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2) the sacred island of [[Delos]]. The largest island of the Cyclades is [[Naxos]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Cyclades}}\n[[File:Harp player, Cycladic civilization - Greece.JPG|thumb|left|140px|''Harp player'', example of Cycladic art, at the National Archeological Museum, Athens]]\n\nThe significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age [[Cycladic culture]] is best known for its schematic, flat idols carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle [[Bronze Age]] [[Minoan civilization]] arose in Crete to the south. (These figures have been looted from burials to satisfy a thriving Cycladic antiquities market since the early 20th century.)\n\nA distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on [[emmer]] and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites include [[Saliagos]] and Kephala (on [[Kea (island)|Kea]]) with signs of copperworking, Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter), and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout antiquity and until the emergence of [[Christianity]].\n\n===Archaeology===\n[[File:Ancient Greek theatre in Delos 01.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient theatre, [[Delos]]]]\n\nThe first archaeological excavations of the 1880s were followed by systematic work by the British School at Athens and by [[Christos Tsountas]], who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898\u20131899 and coined the term \"Cycladic civilization\". Interest lagged, then picked up in the mid-20th century, as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to sculpture by [[Jean Arp]] or [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]. Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these [[Cycladic art|Cycladic figurines]] has been mostly destroyed and their meaning may never be completely understood. \n\nAnother intriguing and mysterious object is that of the Cycladic [[frying pans]]. More accurate [[archaeology]] has revealed the broad outlines of a farming and seafaring culture that had immigrated from [[Anatolia]] c. 5000 BCE. Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between c.&nbsp;3300 \u2013 2000 BCE, when it was increasingly swamped in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. The culture of mainland Greece contemporary with Cycladic culture is known as the [[Helladic period]].\n\nIn recent decades the Cyclades have become popular with European and other [[tourism|tourists]], and as a result there have been problems with [[erosion]], [[pollution]], and water shortages.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Aegean Sea with island groups labeled.gif|thumb|240px|The Cyclades encircle the sacred island of [[Delos]]]]\n[[File:Syros ermoupolis 140707.jpg|thumb|[[Ermoupoli]], capital of the Cyclades.

There are also many minor islands including [[Donousa]], [[Eschati]], [[Gyaros]], [[Irakleia_(Cyclades)|Irakleia]], [[Koufonisia]], [[Makronisos]] and [[Schoinousa]]. The name \"Cyclades\" refers to the islands forming a circle (\"circular islands\") around the sacred island of Delos. Most of the smaller islands are uninhabited.\n\n[[Ermoupoli]] on Syros is the chief town and administrative center of the former prefecture.\n\nThe islands are peaks of a submerged mountainous terrain, with the exception of two [[volcano|volcanic islands]], Milos and Santorini. The climate is generally dry and mild, but with the exception of Naxos the soil is not very fertile; agricultural produce includes [[wine]], [[fruit]], [[wheat]], [[olive oil]], and [[tobacco]].  Cooler temperatures are in higher elevations and mainly do not receive wintry weather.\n\nThe Cyclades are bounded to the south by the [[Sea of Crete]].<ref>Saundry, Hogan & Baum. 2011</ref>\n\n==Administration==\n\nThe '''Cyclades Prefecture''' ({{lang-el|\u039d\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u039a\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd}}) was one of the [[prefectures of Greece]].

It was meant to mimic the [[human visual system]], as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior.<ref name=\"Szeliski2010\" /> In 1966, it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it \"describe what it saw\".<ref name=\"Seymour1966\" /><ref name=\"Boden2006\" />\n\nWhat distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of [[digital image processing]] at that time was a desire to extract [[three-dimensional]] structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the 1970s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including [[Edge detection|extraction of edges]] from images, labeling of lines, non-polyhedral and [[Polyhedron model|polyhedral modeling]], representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, [[optical flow]], and [[motion estimation]].<ref name=\"Szeliski2010\" />\n\nThe next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of [[Scale space|scale-space]], the inference of shape from various cues such as [[shading]], texture and focus, and [[Active contour model|contour models known as snakes]]. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] and [[Markov random field]]s.<ref name=\"Kanade20122\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0jtBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA191|title=Three-Dimensional Machine Vision|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4613-1981-8|author=Takeo Kanade}}</ref>\nBy the 1990s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in [[Projective geometry|projective]] [[3D reconstruction|3-D reconstructions]] led to better understanding of [[Camera resectioning|camera calibration]]. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in [[bundle adjustment]] theory from the field of [[photogrammetry]]. This led to methods for sparse [[3D reconstruction from multiple images|3-D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images]]. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi-view stereo techniques. At the same time, [[Graph cuts in computer vision|variations of graph cut]] were used to solve [[image segmentation]]. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images (see [[Eigenface]]). Toward the end of the 1990s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]] and computer vision. This included image-based rendering, [[Morphing|image morphing]], view interpolation, [[Image stitching|panoramic image stitching]] and early [[Light field|light-field rendering]].<ref name=\"Szeliski2010\" />\n\nRecent work has seen the resurgence of feature-based methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks.<ref name=\"Sebe2005\">{{cite book|author1=Nicu Sebe|author2=Ira Cohen|author3=Ashutosh Garg|author4=Thomas S.

A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing high-level information about the environment and the robot.\n\nArtificial intelligence and computer vision share other topics such as [[pattern recognition]] and learning techniques. Consequently, computer vision is sometimes seen as a part of the artificial intelligence field or the computer science field in general.\n\n===Information Engineering===\nComputer vision is often considered to be part of [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/academic-divisions/information-engineering|title=Information Engineering {{!}} Department of Engineering|website=www.eng.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/|title=Information Engineering Main/Home Page|website=www.robots.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref>\n\n===Solid-state Physics===\n\n[[Solid-state physics]] is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on [[image sensors]], which detect [[electromagnetic radiation]], which is typically in the form of either [[visible light|visible]] or [[infra-red light]]. The sensors are designed using [[quantum physics]]. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of [[optics]] which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated [[image sensors]] even require [[quantum mechanics]] to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process.<ref name=\"Szeliski2010\" /> Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.\n\n===Neurobiology===\n\nA third field which plays an important role is [[neurobiology]], specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how \"real\" vision systems operate in order to solve certain vision related tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision (''e.g.'' [[Artificial neural network|neural net]] and [[deep learning]] based image and feature analysis and classification) have their background in biology.\n\nSome strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of [[biological vision]] \u2013 indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fields.<ref name=\"TextbookP1\" />\n\n===Signal Processing===\n\nYet another field related to computer vision is [[signal processing]]. Many methods for processing of one-variable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of two-variable signals or multi-variable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision which have no counterpart in processing of one-variable signals. Together with the multi-dimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.\n\n===Other fields===\n\nBeside the above-mentioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on [[statistics]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] or [[geometry]]. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision; how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance.\n\n===Distinctions===\n\nThe fields most closely related to computer vision are [[image processing]], [[image analysis]] and [[machine vision]]. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented.\n\n[[Computer graphics]] produces image data from 3D models, computer vision often produces 3D models from image data <ref name=\"3DVAE\">{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Amir-Arsalan/Synthesize3DviaDepthOrSil|title=Soltani, A.

In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 1511-1519).|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, ''e.g.'', as explored in [[augmented reality]].\n\nThe following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally accepted:\n\n* [[Image processing]] and [[image analysis]] tend to focus on 2D images, how to transform one image to another, ''e.g.'', by pixel-wise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processing/analysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.\n* Computer vision includes 3D analysis from 2D images. This analyzes the 3D scene projected onto one or several images, ''e.g.'', how to reconstruct structure or other information about the 3D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.\n* [[Machine vision]] is the process of applying a range of technologies & methods to provide imaging-based automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance<ref name=\"NASAarticle\"/> in industrial applications.<ref name=\"TextbookP1\"/> Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, ''e.g.'', vision based robots and systems for vision based inspection, measurement, or picking (such as [[bin picking]]<ref>https://www.robots.com/blog/viewing/the-future-of-automated-random-bin-picking</ref>). This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that real-time processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.\n* There is also a field called [[imaging science|imaging]] which primarily focus on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, [[medical imaging]] includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.\n* Finally, [[pattern recognition]] is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and [[artificial neural networks]]. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.\n\n[[Photogrammetry]] also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., [[stereophotogrammetry]] vs. [[computer stereo vision]].\n\n==Applications==\nApplications range from tasks such as industrial [[machine vision]] systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computer vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems for:\n\n[[File:Synthesizing 3D Shapes via Modeling Multi-View Depth Maps and Silhouettes With Deep Generative Networks.png|thumb|Learning 3D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in [[deep learning]] has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct 3D shapes from single or multi-view depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently <ref name=\"3DVAE\" />]]\n\n* Automatic inspection, ''e.g.'', in manufacturing applications;\n* Assisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a [[Automated species identification|species identification]] system;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=W\u00e4ldchen|first=Jana|last2=M\u00e4der|first2=Patrick|date=2017-01-07|title=Plant Species Identification Using Computer Vision Techniques: A Systematic Literature Review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-016-9206-z|journal=Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering|language=en|pages=1\u201337|doi=10.1007/s11831-016-9206-z|issn=1134-3060}}</ref>\n* Controlling processes, ''e.g.'', an [[industrial robots|industrial robot]];\n* Detecting events, ''e.g.'', for visual surveillance or [[people counter|people counting]];\n* Interaction, ''e.g.'', as the input to a device for [[computer-human interaction]];\n* Modeling objects or environments, ''e.g.'', medical image analysis or topographical modeling;\n* Navigation, ''e.g.'', by an [[autonomous vehicle]] or [[mobile robot]]; and\n* Organizing information, ''e.g.'', for indexing databases of images and image sequences.\n\n[[File:DARPA Visual Media Reasoning Concept Video.ogv|thumb|[[DARPA]]'s Visual Media Reasoning concept video]]\nOne of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is detection of [[tumour]]s, [[arteriosclerosis]] or other malign changes; measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information: ''e.g.'', about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans\u2014ultrasonic images or X-ray images for example\u2014to reduce the influence of noise.\n\nA second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called [[machine vision]], where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a manufacturing process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called [[optical sorting]].<ref name=\"Davies-2005\" />\n\nMilitary applications are probably one of the largest areas for computer vision. The obvious examples are detection of enemy soldiers or vehicles and [[missile guidance]]. More advanced systems for missile guidance send the missile to an area rather than a specific target, and target selection is made when the missile reaches the area based on locally acquired image data. Modern military concepts, such as \"battlefield awareness\", imply that various sensors, including image sensors, provide a rich set of information about a combat scene which can be used to support strategic decisions. In this case, automatic processing of the data is used to reduce complexity and to fuse information from multiple sensors to increase reliability.\n\n[[File:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Artist's concept of a [[Mars Exploration Rover]], an example of an unmanned land-based vehicle. Notice the [[stereo cameras]] mounted on top of the rover.]]\nOne of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include [[submersible]]s, land-based vehicles (small robots with wheels, cars or trucks), aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles ([[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]). The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous (unmanned) vehicles to vehicles where computer vision based systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, i.e. for knowing where it is, or for producing a map of its environment ([[Simultaneous localization and mapping|SLAM]]) and for detecting obstacles. It can also be used for detecting certain task specific events, ''e.g.'', a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars, and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for [[Driverless car|autonomous driving of cars]], but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles, to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, ''e.g.'', NASA's [[Mars Exploration Rover]] and ESA's [[ExoMars]] Rover.\n\nOther application areas include:\n\n* Support of [[visual effects]] creation for cinema and broadcast, ''e.g.'', [[camera tracking]] (matchmoving).\n* [[Surveillance]].\n* Tracking and counting organisms in the biological sciences <ref name=\"BruijningVisser2018\">{{cite journal|last1=Bruijning|first1=Marjolein|last2=Visser|first2=Marco D.|last3=Hallmann|first3=Caspar A.|last4=Jongejans|first4=Eelke|last5=Golding|first5=Nick|title=trackdem: Automated particle tracking to obtain population counts and size distributions from videos in r |journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution|year=2018|issn=2041210X|doi=10.1111/2041-210X.12975}}</ref>\n\n==Typical tasks==\nEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks; more or less well-defined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.\n\nComputer vision tasks include methods for [[image sensor|acquiring]], [[Image processing|processing]], [[Image analysis|analyzing]] and understanding digital images, and extraction of [[high-dimensional]] data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, ''e.g.'', in the forms of decisions.<ref name=\"Klette-2014\" /><ref name=\"Shapiro-Stockman-2001\" /><ref name=\"Morris-2004\" /><ref name=\"Jahne-Haussecker-2000\" /> Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.<ref name=\"Forsyth-Ponce-2003\" />\n\n===Recognition===\nThe classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and [[machine vision]] is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature:{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n* '''[[Object recognition]]''' (also called '''object classification'''){{spaced ndash}}one or several pre-specified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their 2D positions in the image or 3D poses in the scene. Blippar, [[Google Goggles]] and LikeThat provide stand-alone programs that illustrate this functionality.\n* '''Identification'''{{spaced ndash}}an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of [[MNIST database|handwritten digits]], or identification of a specific vehicle.\n* '''[[Object detection|Detection]]'''{{spaced ndash}}the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.\n\nCurrently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on [[convolutional neural network]]s. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the [[ImageNet#ImageNet Challenge|ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge]]; this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and hundreds of object classes. Performance of convolutional neural networks, on the ImageNet tests, is now close to that of humans.<ref>O. Russakovsky et al., \"[https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge]\", 2014.</ref> The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters (an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras). By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into fine-grained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.\n\nSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such as:\n\n* '''[[Content-based image retrieval]]'''{{spaced ndash}}finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image (give me all images similar to image X), or in terms of high-level search criteria given as text input (give me all images which contains many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them).\n[[File:SRT Shape Recognition Technology.png|thumb|Computer vision for [[people counter]] purposes in public places, malls, shopping centres ]]\n* '''[[Pose (computer vision)|Pose estimation]]'''{{spaced ndash}}estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an [[assembly line]] situation or picking parts from a bin.\n* '''[[Optical character recognition]]''' (OCR){{spaced ndash}}identifying [[Character (computing)|characters]] in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or [[Search index|indexing]] (''e.g.'' [[ASCII]]).\n* '''2D Code reading''' Reading of 2D codes such as [[Data Matrix|data matrix]] and [[QR code|QR]] codes.\n* '''[[Facial recognition system|Facial recognition]]'''\n* ''' [[Pattern recognition|Shape Recognition Technology]]''' (SRT) in [[people counter]] systems differentiating human beings (head and shoulder patterns) from objects\n\n===Motion analysis===\nSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the 3D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images . Examples of such tasks are:\n\n* '''[[Egomotion]]'''{{spaced ndash}}determining the 3D rigid motion (rotation and translation) of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.\n* '''[[video tracking|Tracking]]'''{{spaced ndash}}following the movements of a (usually) smaller set of interest points or objects (''e.g.'', vehicles, humans or other organisms <ref name=\"BruijningVisser2018\">{{cite journal|last1=Bruijning|first1=Marjolein|last2=Visser|first2=Marco D.|last3=Hallmann|first3=Caspar A.|last4=Jongejans|first4=Eelke|last5=Golding|first5=Nick|title=trackdem: Automated particle tracking to obtain population counts and size distributions from videos in r |journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution|year=2018|issn=2041210X|doi=10.1111/2041-210X.12975}}</ref>) in the image sequence.\n* '''[[Optical flow]]'''{{spaced ndash}}to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding 3D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.\n\n===Scene reconstruction===\nGiven one or (typically) more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at [[3D reconstruction|computing a 3D model]] of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of 3D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete 3D surface model. The advent of 3D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Grid-based 3D sensing can be used to acquire 3D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple 3D images together into point clouds and 3D models <ref name='3DVAE' />.\n\n===Image restoration===\nThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise (sensor noise, motion blur, etc.) from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as low-pass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look like, a model which distinguishes them from the noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.\n\nAn example in this field is [[inpainting]].\n\n==System methods==\nThe organization of a computer vision system is highly application dependent. Some systems are stand-alone applications which solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a sub-system of a larger design which, for example, also contains sub-systems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, man-machine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on if its functionality is pre-specified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions which are found in many computer vision systems.\n\n* '''Image acquisition'''{{spaced ndash}}A digital image is produced by one or several [[image sensor]]s, which, besides various types of light-sensitive cameras, include [[rangefinder|range sensors]], tomography devices, radar, ultra-sonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary 2D image, a 3D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands (gray images or colour images), but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|nuclear magnetic resonance]].<ref name=\"Davies-2005\"/>\n* '''Pre-processing'''{{spaced ndash}}Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples are\n** Re-sampling in order to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.\n** Noise reduction in order to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.\n** Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.\n** [[Scale space]] representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.\n* '''[[Feature detection (computer vision)|Feature extraction]]'''{{spaced ndash}}Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data.<ref name=\"Davies-2005\"/> Typical examples of such features are\n** Lines, [[edge detection|edges]] and [[ridge detection|ridges]].\n** Localized [[interest point detection|interest points]] such as [[corner detection|corners]], [[blob detection|blobs]] or points.\n:More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.\n* '''Detection/segmentation'''{{spaced ndash}}At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing.<ref name=\"Davies-2005\"/> Examples are\n** Selection of a specific set of interest points\n** Segmentation of one or multiple image regions which contain a specific object of interest.\n** Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprised foreground, object groups, single objects or [[Salience (neuroscience)|salient]] object parts (also referred to as spatial-taxon scene hierarchy)<ref>Barghout, Lauren. \"Visual Taxometric Approach to Image Segmentation Using Fuzzy-Spatial Taxon Cut Yields Contextually Relevant Regions.\" Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems.

Many of these requirements are really topics for further research.\n\nThe representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are: representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.\n\nWhile inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are: search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence, Volume 1|last = Shapiro|first = Stuart C.|publisher = John WIley & Sons, Inc.|year = 1992|isbn = 0-471-50306-1|location = New York|pages = 643\u2013646}}</ref>\n\n==Hardware==\nThere are many kinds of computer vision systems, nevertheless all of them contain these basic elements: a power source, at least one image acquisition device (i.e. camera, ccd, etc.), a processor as well as control and communication cables or some kind of wireless interconnection mechanism. In addition, a practical vision system contains software, as well as a display in order to monitor the system. Vision systems for inner spaces, as most industrial ones, contain an illumination system and may be placed in a controlled environment. Furthermore, a completed system includes many accessories like camera supports, cables and connectors.\n\nMost computer vision systems use visible-light cameras passively viewing a scene at frame rates of at most 60 frames per second (usually far slower).\n\nA few computer vision systems use image acquisition hardware with active illumination or something other than visible light or both.\nFor example, a [[structured-light 3D scanner]], a [[thermographic camera]], a [[hyperspectral imager]], [[radar imaging]], a [[lidar]] scanner, a [[magnetic resonance image]], a [[side-scan sonar]], a [[synthetic aperture sonar]], or etc.\nSuch hardware captures \"images\" that are then processed often using the same computer vision algorithms used to process visible-light images.\n\nWhile traditional broadcast and consumer video systems operate at a rate of 30 frames per second, advances in [[digital signal processing]] and [[Graphics processing unit|consumer graphics hardware]] has made high-speed image acquisition, processing, and display possible for real-time systems on the order of hundreds to thousands of frames per second. For applications in robotics, fast, real-time video systems are critically important and often can simplify the processing needed for certain algorithms. When combined with a high-speed projector, fast image acquisition allows 3D measurement and feature tracking to be realised.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kagami|first1=Shingo|title=High-speed vision systems and projectors for real-time perception of the world|journal=IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition - Workshops|date=2010|volume=2010|pages=100\u2013107|doi=10.1109/CVPRW.2010.5543776|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=5543776|accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Egocentric vision]] systems are composed of a wearable camera that automatically take pictures from a first-person perspective. \n\nAs of 2016, [[vision processing unit]]s are emerging as a new class of processor, to complement CPUs and [[graphics processing units]] (GPUs) in this role.<ref name=\"the rise of VPUs\">{{cite web |title=A Third Type Of Processor For VR/AR: Movidius' Myriad 2 VPU |website=www.tomshardware.com |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/movidiud-myriad2-vpu-vision-processing-vr,30850.html |author=Seth Colaner |date=January 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Computational imaging]]\n* [[Computational photography]]\n* [[Machine vision glossary]]\n* [[Space mapping]]\n* [[Teknomo\u2013Fernandez algorithm]]\n* [[Visual system]]\n* [[Visual perception]]\n* [[Vision science]]\n* [[Egocentric vision]]\n* [[Visual agnosia]]\n\n=== Lists ===\n* [[List of computer vision topics]]\n* [[List of emerging technologies]]\n* [[Outline of artificial intelligence]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|\nrefs=\n<ref name=\"Klette-2014\">\n{{cite book|author=Reinhard Klette|title=Concise Computer Vision|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4471-6320-6}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Shapiro-Stockman-2001\">\n{{cite book|author1=[[Linda Shapiro|Linda G.

For example, in original traditional cuisines, the precise selection of spices for each dish is a matter of national or regional cultural tradition, religious practice, and, to some extent, family preference. Such dishes are called by specific names that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods.<ref>{{cite book|author=Collingham, Lizzie|title=Curry: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors|location=New York, NY|publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 2006|page=115}} \"No Indian, however, would have referred to his or her food as a curry. The idea of a curry is, in fact, a concept that the Europeans imposed on India's food culture. Indians referred to their different dishes by specific names ... But the British lumped all these together under the heading of curry.\"</ref>  Spices are used both whole and ground, cooked or raw, and they may be added at different times during the cooking process to produce different results.  The main spices found in most curry powders of the Indian subcontinent  are [[coriander]], [[cumin]], and [[turmeric]]. A wide range of additional spices may be included depending on the geographic region and the foods being included (fish, lentils, red or white meat, rice, and vegetables).<ref>{{cite book|author=Raghavan, S. |title=Handbook of Spices, Seasonings and Flavourings|publisher= CRC Press|date= 2007 |isbn=0-8493-2842-X|page= 302}}</ref> [[Curry powder]], a commercially prepared mixture of spices, is largely a Western creation, dating to the 18th century. Such mixtures are commonly thought to have first been prepared by Indian merchants for sale to members of the [[British Raj|British Colonial government and army]] returning to Britain.\n\nDishes called 'curry' may contain fish, meat, poultry, or shellfish, either alone or in combination with vegetables. Additionally, many instead are entirely vegetarian, eaten especially among those who hold ethical or religious proscriptions against eating meat or seafood.\n\nCurries may be either 'dry' or 'wet'.  Dry curries are cooked with very little liquid which is allowed to evaporate, leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture. Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on yogurt, cream, coconut milk, coconut cream, legume pur\u00e9e, tomato pur\u00e9e, saut\u00e9ed crushed onion or broth.\n\n==Etymology==\nCurry was adopted and anglicized from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word ''{{IAST|ka\u1e5fi}}'' meaning 'sauce' or 'relish for rice'.<ref name=\"oed\">{{cite web |title=Curry |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/curry#etymonline_v_491 |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper |accessdate=8 October 2018 |date=2018}}</ref> It is usually understood to mean vegetables or meat cooked with spices with or without a gravy, used first in English in 1747 when a curry recipe was published by [[Hannah Glasse]].<ref name=oed/><ref name=\"taylor\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/0/24432750|title=Curry: Where did it come from?|publisher=BBC: Food Knowledge and Learning|date=11 October 2013|author=Taylor, Anna-Louise|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n''Cury'' (from French cuire, meaning to cook) appeared in the 1390s in an English cookbook, ''The Forme of Cury'',<ref name=taylor/> and ''kari'' was first described in a mid-17th century [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]] cookbook<ref name=taylor/> by members of the British [[East India Company]] trading with Tamil (Indian) merchants along the [[Coromandel Coast]] of southeast India,<ref name = \"SahniCur\">Sahni, Julie.

Most Indian dishes are usually curry based, prepared by adding different types of vegetables, lentils or meats in the curry. The content of the curry and style of preparation varies per the region. Most curries are water based, with occasional use of dairy and coconut milk. Curry dishes are usually thick and spicy and are eaten along with steamed rice and variety of Indian breads.\n\n====Gujarat====\n{{Main article|Gujarati cuisine}}\nAlthough wet curries play a smaller role in Gujarat than elsewhere, there are a number of vegetarian examples with gravies based on buttermilk or coconut milk. The main ingredient may variously be brinjal ([[eggplant]]/aubergine), potatoes, fresh corn kernels, [[okra]], tomatoes, etc. In addition, there are several common [[kofta]] dishes which substitute vegetables for meat.<ref>Reejhsinghani, Aroona. ''Vegetarian Wonders from Gujarat.'' (Mumbai: Jaico Publishing House, c.2002), p.123-128.</ref> [[Undhiyu]], a Gujarati specialty, is a spicy 'wet' mixed-vegetable 'casserole' cooked in an earthenware pot, often eaten during the winter months.\n<!-- Curry varies in flavour and heat.

Coastal Maharashtrian \u2013 Konkani \u2013 curries use coconut extensively along with spices. In western Maharashtra, curries are very spicy, often with [[peanut]] powder. [[Vidarbha|Vidharba's cuisine]] is usually spicier than that of the coastal and southern regions. The ingredients commonly used are besan ([[gram flour]]), or [[chickpea]] flour, and groundnut powder. As a result of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule in the region, the cuisine of [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] has been highly influenced by the North Indian method of cooking. [[Khandesh]]i food is very spicy and the most famous dish is shev bhaji. Others include Eggplant [[Baingan bharta|bharta]] (wangyache bhareet), ([[Vigna mungo|urid dal]]), Stuffed eggplant (bharleli wangi),  bhaakari with [[thecha]]  etc.The majority of Maharashtrian  people are farmers living in the rural areas and therefore their traditional food is very simple.\n\n====Punjab====\n{{Unreferenced|date=October 2018}}\n{{Main article|Punjabi cuisine}}\nMost Punjabi dishes are prepared using ''[[Tempering (Spices)|tadka]]'', which is made with the frying of a \"[[masala (spice)|masala]]\", which is a mix of ginger, garlic, onions and tomatoes with some dried spices. This is followed by the addition of other ingredients, water, and occasionally milk. Normally spicy, spice levels vary greatly depending on the household itself. [[Ghee]] and [[mustard oil]] are the most commonly used cooking fats. Many popular Punjabi dishes such as [[butter chicken]] and [[rajma]] are curry-based. These dishes are usually served with steamed rice and [[chapati]]s.\n\n====Rajasthan====\n{{Unreferenced|date=October 2018}}\n{{Main article|Rajasthani cuisine}}\n\n[[Rajasthan]]i cuisine was influenced both by the war-like lifestyles of its inhabitants and the availability of ingredients in this arid region.<ref name=\"Dubey\">Krishna Gopal Dubey, The Indian Cuisine, PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd., pp.193</ref> Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. Scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have each had their effect on the cooking. Hence the curries in Rajasthan are usually made using dry spices and herbs and other dry items like gram flour. ''[[Kadhi]]'' is a popular gram flour curry, usually served with steamed rice and bread. To decrease the use of water in this desert state they use a lot of milk and milk-products to cook curries. [[Laal maans]] is a popular meat curry from Rajasthan.\n\n===Southern India===\n{{Main article|South Indian cuisine}}\n\n====Andhra Pradesh and Telangana====\n{{Main article|Telugu cuisine}}\n\nThe food in general from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, both with Telugu-speaking natives, is considered the hottest in India. The state, being the leading producer of red chilli and green chilli, influences the liberal use of spices, making their curries, chutneys, savories and pickles the hottest and spiciest in taste.\n\n====Goa====\n\nCurries known as [[vindaloo]] have become well known in Great Britain, America, and elsewhere, where the name is usually used simply to indicate a fiery dish of lamb or chicken frequently including potatoes. Such dishes are far from the Goan originals.\n\nThe name \"vindaloo\" derives from the Portuguese ''vinha d'alhos'' or wine (''vinho'') and garlic (''alho''), the two definitive flavour ingredients. The dish was originally made with pork, not taboo to the Christian Portuguese. The inclusion of potatoes was a later Indian addition, thought to be the result of confusion with the Hindi word for potato, ''aloo''. Throughout the years \"vindaloo\" has been altered to appeal to many people by adding spices and different wines.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.saveur.com/article/cooking/the-history-of-vindaloo|title=Fired Up: The History of Vindaloo|work=SAVEUR|access-date=27 November 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Karnataka====\n{{Main article|Cuisine of Karnataka}}\n\nThe curries of Karnataka are typically vegetarian or with meat and fish around mostly coastal areas. They use a wide variety of vegetables, spices, coconut and [[jaggery]]. There are dry and sauce-based curries. Some typical sauce-based dishes include [[saaru]], gojju, thovve, huli, majjige huli (which is similar to the ''kadi'' made in the north), sagu or kootu, which is eaten mixed with hot rice.\n\n====Kerala====\n{{Main article|Cuisine of Kerala}}\n\n[[Malayali]] curries of [[Kerala]] typically contain shredded [[coconut]] paste or [[coconut milk]], curry leaves, and various spices. Mustard seeds are used in almost every dish, along with onions, curry leaves, and sliced red chilies fried in hot oil. Most of the non-vegetarian dishes are heavily spiced. Kerala is known for its traditional [[sadya]], a vegetarian meal served with boiled rice and a host of side dishes such as [[parippu]] (green gram), [[papadum]], ghee, [[Sambar (dish)|sambar]], [[rasam]], [[aviyal]], [[kaalan]], [[kichadi]], [[pachadi]], [[injipuli]], [[Koottukari]], [[Indian pickle|pickles]] (mango, lime), [[thoran]], one to four types of [[payasam]], [[Boli (food)|boli]], [[Olan (dish)|olan]], pulissery, moru ([[buttermilk]]), upperi, and [[banana]] chips. The sadya is customarily served on a banana leaf.\n\n====Tamil Nadu====\n{{Main article|Tamil cuisine}}\n\n[[Tamil cuisine]]'s distinctive flavour and aroma is achieved by a blend and combination of [[spice]]s including curry leaves, [[tamarind]], [[coriander]], [[ginger]], [[garlic]], chili, [[black pepper|pepper]], [[poppy seed]]s, [[mustard seed]]s, [[cinnamon]], [[clove]]s, [[cardamom]], cumin, [[fennel]] or [[anise]] seeds, [[fenugreek seed]]s, [[nutmeg]], [[coconut]], turmeric root or powder, and [[rosewater]]. [[Lentil]]s, [[vegetable]]s and [[dairy product]]s are essential accompaniments and are often served with rice. Traditionally vegetarian foods dominate the menu with a range of non-vegetarian dishes including [[freshwater]] [[Fish (food)|fish]] and [[seafood]] cooked with spices and seasoning.\n\n===Kashmir===\n{{Main article|Kashmiri cuisine}}\nIn the West, the best-known [[Kashmir]]i curry is ''[[rogan josh]]'', a wet curry of lamb with a brilliant red gravy whose colour is derived from a combination of Kashmiri chillies and an extract derived from the red flowers of the [[Celosia|cockscomb plant]] (''mawal'').<ref>\"Rogan Josh,\" in Khan Mohammed Sharief Waza, Khan Mohammed Shafi Waza, and Khan Mohammed Rafiq Waza.

The spices added vary, but usually include turmeric, [[black mustard]] seed, and curry leaves. It is often eaten with rice. [[North India]], where dishes are classified as ''sukhi'' (dry) and ''tari'' (with liquid), the word ''curry'' is often confounded with the similar-sounding [[Hindi]] word ''tari'' (from the [[Persian language|Persian]]-derived ''tar'' meaning ''wet'') and has no implications for the presence or absence of spice, or whether the dish is Indian or not (e.g. any stew, spicy or not, would be considered a curry dish, simply because it is wet).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fk8FQa2ZSFQC |title=India| author=Sarina Singh |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=17 May 2010|quote=generally cooked sukhi (dry) or tari (in a sauce) | isbn=978-1-74059-694-7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2saAQAAIAAJ|title=Hanklyn-janklin: a stranger's rumble-tumble guide to some words, customs, and quiddities, Indian and Indo-British| author=Nigel B.

''Kukulhu riha'', [[chicken curry]], is cooked with a different mixture of spices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4398927/Eating_on_the_Islands_-_As_times_have_changed_so_has_the_Maldives_unique_cuisine_and_culture|title=Eating on the Islands - As times have changed, so has the Maldives' unique cuisine and culture|author=Xavier Romero-Frias|work=academia.edu}}</ref>\n\nTraditional vegetable curries in the Maldives include those that use ''bashi'' ([[eggplant|eggplant/aubergine]]), ''tora'' (''[[Luffa aegyptiaca]]''), ''barab\u014d'' ([[pumpkin]]), ''chichanda'' (''[[Trichosanthes cucumerina]]'') and ''muranga'' (''[[Moringa oleifera]]''), as well as green unripe [[banana]]s and certain leaves as their main ingredients.

Well known Indian spices are used less. Goat is a popular meat in the Himalayan region of Nepal.\n\n[[Daal bhaat]] (rice and [[lentil soup]]) is a staple dish of [[Nepal]]. [[Newa cuisine]] is a type of cuisine developed over centuries by the [[Newar]]s of Nepal.\n\n===Pakistan===\n{{Main article|Pakistani cuisine}}\n\nPakistani curries, especially in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh are basically similar to their counterparts in northern India. Mutton and beef are common ingredients. A typical Pakistani lunch or dinner often consists of some form of bread (such as naan or roti) or rice with a meat or vegetable-based curry. Barbecue style or roasted meats are also very popular in the form of kebabs.\n\nIt is worth noting that the term ''curry'' is virtually never used inside the country; instead, regional words such as ''salan'' or ''shorba'' are used to denote what is known outside the country as a \"curry\".\n\nSeveral different types of curries exist, depending on the cooking style, such as bhuna, bharta, roghan josh, qorma, qeema, and shorba. A favourite [[Pakistan]]i curry is [[karahi]], which is either mutton or chicken cooked in a cooking utensil called karahi, which is similar in shape to a wok. Lahori karahi incorporates garlic, ginger, fresh chillies, tomatoes and select spices. Peshawari karahi is another very popular version made with just meat, salt, tomatoes, and coriander.\n\n====Khyber Pakhtunkhwa====\n{{Main article|Afghan cuisine|Pashtun cuisine}}\n\nThe cuisine from the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province of [[Pakistan]] is somewhat similar to the cuisine of neighbouring [[Afghanistan]]. Extreme winters in some areas made the supply of fresh vegetables impossible, so a lot of dried fruits and vegetables are incorporated in the cuisine. The province still produces a large amount of nuts which are used abundantly in traditional cooking, along with cereals like wheat, maize, barley, and rice. Accompanying these staples are dairy products (yoghurt, whey), various nuts, native vegetables, and fresh and dried fruits. Peshawari karahi from the provincial capital of [[Peshawar]] is a popular curry all over the country.\n\n====Punjab====\n{{Main article|Punjabi cuisine}}\nCuisine in Pakistani Punjab differs from Indian Punjab on account of contents and religious diet rules. A typical Punjabi meal consists of some form of bread or rice with a ''salan'' (curry). Most preparations start with the frying of a [[spice mix|masala]] which is a concoction of ginger, garlic, onions, tomatoes,  and dried spices.  Various other ingredients are then added.  Spice level varies greatly depending on the sub-region as well as the household itself. A popular cooking fat is desi ghee with some dishes enriched with liberal amounts of [[butter]] and [[cream]]. There are certain dishes that are exclusive to Punjab, such as maash di dal and saron da saag (sarson ka saag). In Punjab and Kashmir, the only dish known as kardhi (curry) is a dish made of dahi (yogurt) and flour dumplings.\n\n====Sindh====\n{{Main article|Sindhi cuisine}}\n\nIn Pakistan, the provinces of [[Sindh]] and [[Balochistan]] border the [[Arabian Sea]]. Due to this, the Sindhi cuisine often has abundant use of fish in curries. Among Pakistani food, the Sindhi curries generally tend to be the hottest. The daily food in most Sindhi households consists of [[wheat]]-based flatbread ([[phulka]]) and rice accompanied by two dishes, one [[gravy]] and one dry.\n\n===Sri Lanka===\n{{Main article|Sri Lankan cuisine}}\n\nIn [[Sri Lanka]]n cuisine, [[rice]], which is usually consumed daily, can be found at any special occasion, while spicy curries are favourite dishes for lunch and dinner. \"[[Rice and curry]]\" refers to a range of Sri Lankan dishes.\n\n==Southeast Asia==\n{{See also|Cambodian cuisine|Lao cuisine|Singaporean cuisine}}\n\n===Burma===\n{{See also|Burmese cuisine}}\n[[Burma|Burmese]] cuisine is based on a very different understanding of curries. The principal ingredients of almost all Burmese curries are fresh onion (which provides the gravy and main body of the curry), Indian spices and red chilies. Usually, meat and fish are the main ingredients for popular curries.\n\nBurmese curries can be generalised into two types \u2013 the hot spicy dishes which exhibit north Indian or Pakistani influence, and the milder \"sweet\" curries. Burmese curries almost overwhelmingly lack coconut milk, setting them apart from most southeast Asian curries.\n\nRegular ingredients include fresh onion, garlic and [[Chili pepper paste|chili paste]]. Common spices include [[garam masala]], dried chili powder, cumin powder, turmeric and [[Cuisine of Burma#Ngapi|ngapi]], a fermented paste made from either fish or prawns. Burmese curries are quite oily, as the extra oil helps the food to last longer. A spaghetti equivalent called [[Nan gyi thohk]] exists, in which wheat or rice noodles are eaten with thick chicken curry.\n\n===Indonesia===\n{{See also|Indonesian cuisine}}\n[[File:Roti Cane Kari Kambing.jpg|thumb|''Kari kambing'' (mutton curry) served with ''[[roti canai]]'' in [[Sumatra]].]]\nIn [[Indonesia]] curry is called ''kari'' or ''kare''. The most common type of ''kari'' consumed in Indonesia is ''kari ayam'' (chicken curry) and ''kari kambing'' (goat meat curry). In [[Aceh]] and [[North Sumatra]] [[Roti Canai|roti cane]] is often eaten with ''kari kambing''. Other dishes such as [[gulai]] and [[Opor ayam|opor]] are dishes based on curry. They are often highly localised and reflect the meat and vegetables available. They can therefore employ a variety of meats (chicken, beef, water buffalo and goat as in the flavoursome ''gulai kambing''), seafood (such as prawn, crab, mussel, clam, and squid), fish (tuna, mackerel, carp, pangasius, catfish), or vegetables (young [[jackfruit]], common beans, [[cassava]] leaf) dishes in a spiced sauce. They use local ingredients such as chili peppers, [[kaffir lime]] leaves, [[lemongrass]], [[galangal]], [[Bay leaf#Taxonomy|Indonesian bay leaves]] (salam leaf), [[candlenut]]s, turmeric, turmeric leaves, [[Garcinia atroviridis|asam gelugur]] and [[Garcinia#Selected species|asam kandis]] (sour [[Garcinia|mangosteens]] similar to [[tamarind]]), [[terasi|shrimp paste]] (terasi), cumin, coriander seed and [[coconut milk]]. In Aceh, curries use ''daun salam koja'' or ''daun kari'' (''[[Murraya koenigii]]'') translated as \"curry leaves\".\n\nOne popular dish, [[rendang]] from [[Minangkabau cuisine|West Sumatran cuisine]], is often described as caramelised beef dry curry. In Indonesia, rendang is usually not considered to be curry since it is richer and contains less liquid than is normal for Indonesian curries. Authentic rendang uses water buffalo meat slow-cooked in thick coconut milk for a number of hours to tenderise, caramelise, and flavour the meat. [[Opor Ayam]] is another variation of curry, which tastes very similar to gulai. Opor is usually whitish in colour and uses neither cinnamon nor turmeric, while gulai may contain either or both. Opor is also often part of a family meal around [[Eid ul-Fitr|Lebaran]], while gulai can be commonly found in [[Padang food|Padang restaurants]].\n\n===Malaysia===\n{{See also|Malaysian cuisine}}\nBeing at the crossroads of ancient trade routes has left a mark on the Malaysian cuisine. While the curry may have initially found its way to Malaysian shores via the Indian population, it has since become a staple among the Malays and Chinese too. Malaysian curries differ from state to state, even within similar ethnic groupings, as they are influenced by many factors, be it cultural, religious, agricultural or economical.\n\nMalaysian curries typically use turmeric-rich curry powders, coconut milk, shallots, ginger, [[belacan]] (shrimp paste), chili peppers, and garlic. [[Tamarind]] is also often used. [[Rendang]] is another form of curry consumed in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines; it is drier and contains mostly meat and more coconut milk than a conventional Malaysian curry. Rendang was mentioned in Malay literature [[Hikayat Amir Hamzah]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rahQDaE0bD8C&pg=PA10&dq=rendang+hikayat |title=Hikayat Amir Hamzah |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=8 June 2009 | isbn=978-983-192-116-6|year=2008 }}</ref> (1550s) and is popular among Indonesians, Singaporeans and Malaysians. All sorts of things are curried in Malaysia, including mutton, chicken, shrimp, cuttlefish, fish, [[eggplant]]s, eggs, and vegetables. The vegetarians in Malaysia may make vegetarian curries with vegetables or tofu based products.\n\n===Philippines===\n[[File:Philippine Chicken curry.jpg|thumb|Chicken curry (La Familia, Baliuag, Bulacan, Philippines)]]\n{{See also|Philippine cuisine}}\nIn the Philippines, two kinds of curry traditions are seen corresponding with the cultural divide between the Westernised north and Islamised south. In the northern areas, a linear range of new curry recipes could be seen. Chicken is cooked in coconut milk, chillies and curry powder. This is the usual curry dish that northern Filipinos are familiar with. A typical northern Filipino curry dish would usually contain pork or chicken cooked in a similar manner to other local dishes such as ''[[adobo]]'', ''[[kaldereta]]'', and ''[[mechado]]'', with additions of ''patis'' ([[fish sauce]]), potatoes, bay leaf, birds eye chillies and coconut milk, sometimes complemented by lemongrass and carrots.\n\nIn southern areas of the [[Visayas]], Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago and southern Palawan, various older curry recipes are seen, and owe their origins to the Southern Philippines\u2019 non-colonised history, keeping a precolonised and very southeast Asian Malay World culture intact.\nThese Mindanaoan curries include ''Kulma'', synonymous with the Indian [[Korma]], ''Tiyula Itum'' which is a beef curry blackened with burned coconut-meat powder, and [[Rendang]], also eaten in Indonesia and Malaysia. Meats used in these curries include beef, goat, mutton, lamb, seafood and chicken. Pork is not used, in accordance with Islamic dietary laws.\n\n===Thailand===\n{{Main article|Thai curry}}\n[[File:Phanaeng mu.jpg|thumb|Thai ''phanaeng'' with pork]]\nIn Thai cuisine, curries are called ''kaeng'', and usually consist of meat, fish and/or vegetables in a sauce based on a paste made from chilies, onions or shallots, garlic, and [[shrimp paste]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thaicooking.nationmultimedia.com/?p=1382 |title=Thai cooking, food thai, Thai menu, pad thai recipe |publisher=Thaicooking.nationmultimedia.com |date= |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref> Additional spices and herbs define the type of curry. Local ingredients, such as chili peppers, [[kaffir lime]] leaves, [[lemon grass]], [[galangal]] are used and, in central and southern Thai cuisine, coconut milk. Northern and northeastern Thai curries generally do not contain coconut milk. Due to the use of sugar and coconut milk, Thai curries tend to be sweeter than Indian curries. In the West, some of the Thai curries are described by colour; [[red curry|red curries]] use red chilies while [[green curry|green curries]] use green chilies. [[Yellow curry]]\u2014called ''kaeng kari'' (by various spellings) in [[Thai language|Thai]], of which a literal translation could be \"curry soup\"\u2014is more similar to Indian curries, with the use of turmeric, cumin, and other dried spices.

It is more soup-like than Indian curry. The curry is usually eaten with a [[baguette]], rice [[vermicelli]] or steamed rice. Some dishes use a curry-based stew, such as [[snail]] dishes, [[ph\u00e1 l\u1ea5u]], stewed frogs or eels.\n\n==East Asia==\n\n===China===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n{{See also|Chinese cuisine}}\nChinese curries (\u5496\u54e9, g\u0101 l\u01d0) typically consist of chicken, beef, fish, lamb, or other meats, green peppers, onions, large chunks of potatoes, and a variety of other ingredients and spices in a mildly spicy yellow curry sauce, and topped over [[steamed rice]]. White pepper, soy sauce, hot sauce, and/or hot chili oil may be applied to the sauce to enhance the flavour of the curry.\n\nThe most common Chinese variety of curry sauce is usually sold in powder form.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The ethnic Cantonese being dominant in [[Kuala Lumpur]], this yellow [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese-Malaysian]] variety was naturally introduced to China by the Cantonese.

By the fourth edition of the book, other ingredients such as turmeric and ginger were called for. The use of hot spices was not mentioned, which reflected the limited use of chili in India \u2014 [[chili pepper|chili plants]] had only been introduced into India around the late 16th century and at that time were only popular in southern India.\n\nMany curry recipes are contained in 19th century cookbooks such as those of [[Charles Elm\u00e9 Francatelli]] and [[Mrs Beeton]]. In ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'', a recipe for curry powder is given that contains coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, cayenne, mustard, ginger, allspice and fenugreek; although she notes that it is more economical to purchase the powder at \"any respectable shop\".<ref>{{Cite book| title= Mrs. Beeton's book of household management | author=Isabella Mary Beeton | page=215 | isbn=0-304-35726-X | year = 1861}}</ref>\n\n<!--However, the use of fresh spices such as ginger and [[garlic]], and preparation of an initial masala from freshly ground dried spices are sometimes used.-->\nAccording to legend, one 19th century attempt at curry resulted in the invention of [[Worcestershire sauce]].<ref>{{Cite book| title= Curry: A tale of cooks and conquerors | author=Lizzie Collingham | isbn=0-09-943786-4 | year = 2006 | publisher = Vintage | chapter = Curry Powder| pages=149\u2013150 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, curry grew increasingly popular in Britain owing to the large number of British civil servants and military personnel associated with the [[British Raj]]. Following World War II, curry became even more popular in Britain owing to the large number of immigrants from South Asia.\n\nCurry has become an integral part of British cuisine, so much so that, since the late 1990s, [[chicken tikka masala]] has been referred to as \"a true British national dish\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/race/story/0,,657407,00.html|title=Robin Cook's chicken tikka masala speech|accessdate=12 December 2006 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=19 April 2001}}</ref>\n\nOther British curry derivatives include \"[[Coronation chicken]]\", a cold dish, often used as a sandwich filling, invented to commemorate the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953 \u2013 and '''curry sauce''' (or '''curry gravy'''), usually served warm with traditional British fast food dishes such as [[French fried potatoes|chips]]. Curry sauce occasionally includes [[Sultana (grape)|sultana]]s.\n\n====Curry house====\nIn 1810, the entrepreneur [[Sake Dean Mahomed]], from the [[Bengal Presidency]], opened the first Indian curry house in England: the [[Hindoostanee Coffee House]] in London.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Curry house founder is honoured|date=29 September 2005|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4290124.stm|accessdate=9 October 2008 | location=London}}</ref> (Curry was served prior to this in some London [[Coffee House|coffee houses]].) <ref>{{cite news |last=Jahangir |first=Rumeana |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8370054.stm |title=How Britain got the hots for curry |publisher=BBC News |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe first modern \"upscale\" Indian restaurant in Britain is thought to have been The Shafi in 1915,<ref>Grove, Peter and Colleen.

In London, they settled in the East End, which for centuries has been the first port of call for many immigrants working in the docks and shipping from east Bengal. Their regular stopover paved the way for food and curry outlets to be opened up catering for an all-male workforce as family migration and settlement took place some decades later. [[Brick Lane]] in the East [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] is famous for its many curry houses.\n\nUntil the early 1970s, more than three-quarters of Indian restaurants in Britain were identified as being owned and run by people of Bengali origin. Most were run by migrants from East Pakistan, which became Bangladesh in 1971. Bangladeshi restaurateurs overwhelmingly come from the northeastern division of [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]]. Until 1998, as many as 85% of curry restaurants in the UK were [[British Bangladeshi]] restaurants,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curryhouse.co.uk/scene/ethnshow.htm|title=UK Curry Scene|accessdate=12 December 2006}}</ref> but in 2003 this figure declined to just over 65%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/177_food/page5.shtml|title=Indian Curry in London|accessdate=12 December 2006}}</ref> The dominance of Bangladeshi restaurants is generally declining in some parts of London and the further north one travels.

This has been attributed to the sale of this style of food in generic restaurants, increased home cooking of this style of food with easy supermarket availability of ingredients, and [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|immigration restrictions brought in from 2008]] making the availability of low-wage chefs and other staff difficult.<ref name=observer-20120108>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/08/britains-curry-crisis-chefs-immigration |title=The curry crisis |author=Homa Khaleeli |newspaper=The Observer |date=8 January 2012 |accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=guardian-20170112>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/12/who-killed-the-british-curry-house |title=Who killed the great British curry house? |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 January 2017 |accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nRegardless of the ethnic origin of a restaurant's ownership, the menu will often be influenced by the wider [[South Asia]] (sometimes including [[Nepalese cuisine|Nepalese dishes]]), and sometimes cuisines from further afield (such as [[Cuisine of Iran|Persian dishes]]). Some British variations on Indian food are now being exported from the U.K. to India.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8635456.stm|title=Can the British curry take off in India?|accessdate=23 April 2010 | work=BBC News | date=21 April 2010}}</ref> Curry restaurants of  more-or-less the British style are also popular in [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].\n\nThis cuisine is characterised by the use of a common base for all the sauces to which spices are added when individual dishes are prepared. The standard \"feedstock\" is usually a saut\u00e9ed mixture of onion, garlic and fresh ginger, to which various spices are added, depending on the recipe, but which may include: cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, chilies, peppercorns, cumin and mustard seeds. Ground coriander seed is widely used as a thickening agent, and turmeric is added for colour and its digestive qualities.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Fresh or canned tomatoes and bell peppers are a common addition.\n\nBetter quality restaurants will normally make up new sauces on a daily basis, using fresh ingredients wherever possible and grinding their own spices. More modest establishments are more likely to resort to frozen or dried ingredients and pre-packaged spice mixtures.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n====Terminology====\nRestaurants in Great Britain have adopted a number of Indian terms to identify popular dishes. Although the names may derive from traditional dishes, often the recipes do not. Representative names include:\n\n* Bhuna \u2013 medium, thick sauce, some vegetables (''bhunna'' in Urdu means \"to be fried\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bhuna |title=Bhuna &#124; Define Bhuna at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Biryani]] \u2013 spiced rice and meat cooked together and usually served with vegetable curry sauce.\n* Curry \u2013 the most common name for a meat dish (most often chicken or lamb) with a medium-spicy, brown, gravy-like sauce.\n* [[Dhansak]] \u2013 in the curry house, it may be made with either lamb or chicken and frequently contains pineapple, though this is not original.<ref>Chapman, Pat.

Continental and British recipes have also evolved alongside [[Indian South African]] curries. Continental and British versions use mainly traditional recipes with the addition of [[wine|red wine]], [[milk]], [[cream]], vanilla or [[butter]] instead of ghee.\n\nBunny chow or a \"set\", a South African standard, has spread in popularity throughout the country and into other southern African countries and countries with large South African immigrant populations.<ref name=seid/><ref name=ishay/> It consists of either lamb, chicken or bean curry poured into a tunnelled-out loaf of [[bread]] to be eaten with one's fingers.<ref name=ishay/> The roti roll is another classic takeaway curry that could either be a curry in a flat roti bread (similar to a [[kebab]] bread) or the classic \"chip, cheese and curry\" roll which basically consists of [[French fries|fried chips]] with melted [[cheese]] and curry gravy rolled into a roti roll.\n\n==West Indies==\nIn the [[West Indies]], curry is a very popular dish. The Indian indentured servants that were brought over from India by different European powers brought this dish to the West Indies. In Jamaica and Trinidad, curried goat is prominently featured. Curry can be found at both inexpensive and upscale Caribbean restaurants, and ingredients can range from chicken or vegetables to shellfish such as shrimp and scallops. Examples of curries in the West Indies include:\n\n* [[Cuisine of Guyana|Guyana]]: Chicken, goat, duck, shrimp, beef, \"aloo\" (potato), channa, fish (different varieties) and crab curry are very popular among Guyana, most predominately within [[Indo-Guyanese people]].\n* [[Cuisine of Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad and Tobago]]: Especially curried chicken, crab, duck, goat, beef, shrimp, and \"aloo\" (potato), along with wild meats.\n* [[Cuisine of Jamaica|Jamaica]]: Especially curried chicken, [[Curry goat|goat]], fish and shrimp.\n* [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]]: Curried mutton (goat or lamb), curried chicken, curried pork chops.\n\n==Other countries==\n\n===Fiji===\nIn [[Fiji]] curries are made in most Indian homes and are eaten with rice or [[roti]]. Roti (circle or square) is mainly eaten for breakfast with vegetable curries. Lunch is often dal and rice with some side dishes. Most working people take roti and curry for their lunch.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Dinner is usually curry, rice with some chutneys. Curries are normally cooked in vegetable oil. Ghee is mainly used to fry dal, to make puris or sweets. To make a curry, spices like cumin, fenugreek, mustard, and curry leaves are added to the hot oil. Onion is chopped or sliced and garlic crushed and added to the pot. Once the onion and garlic have turned slightly golden then turmeric and garam masala are added. For every 1 tsp turmeric normally 2 tsp masala is added.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Salt and chillies are added according to taste. Curry  is simmered on low heat until well cooked. Water is added so that it can be mixed with rice. If coriander leaves are available then they are added for extra flavour.\n\nSometimes potatoes or vegetables are also added to curries to increase volume and make them more nutritious. Often coconut cream is added to seafood curries, such as prawn, crab or fish curries. Dal is often cooked with only turmeric and then fried in cumin, onion, and garlic. Sometimes carrots and leafy vegetables like ''chauraiya'' or ''saijan'' are added for extra flavor and nutrients.\n\n===Similar dishes===\n* [[African cuisine|Central Africa]]: Groundnut stew, though not technically a curry, is a similar style.\n* [[Central Europe]]: [[Goulash]] is a spicy stew or soup usually made with paprika, garlic, potatoes, beef or pork and dill. Not served with rice.\n* [[Ethiopian cuisine|Ethiopia]]: [[Wat (food)|Wat]], a thick, heavily spiced stew.\n* [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]], and [[Tonga]]: Generally known as \"kare\" or \"kale\", curry is popular in curried lamb, mutton, and chicken stew. Often prepared with coconut milk and accompanied by rice or taro.\n* [[German cuisine|Germany]]: [[Currywurst]].\n* [[Mexico]]: Mole, which also originally meant sauce, features different regional variations and combinations of chilies, spices, and chocolate.\n\n==Curry powder==\n{{Main article| Curry powder}}\nCurry powder is a spice mixture of widely varying composition developed by the British during the days of the Raj as a means of approximating the taste of Indian cuisine at home. [[spice mix|Masala]] refers to spices, and this is the name given to the thick and pasty sauce based on a combination of spices with ghee (clarified butter), butter, palm oil or coconut milk. Most commercial curry powders available in Britain, the U.S. and Canada rely heavily on ground turmeric, in turn producing a very yellow sauce. Lesser ingredients in these Western yellow curry powders are often coriander, cumin, [[fenugreek]], mustard, chili, black pepper and salt. By contrast, curry powders and curry pastes produced and consumed in India are extremely diverse; some red, some yellow, some brown; some with five spices and some with as many as 20 or more. Besides the previously mentioned spices, other commonly found spices in different curry powders in India are allspice, white pepper, ground mustard, ground ginger, cinnamon, roasted cumin, cloves, nutmeg, mace, green cardamom seeds or black cardamom pods, bay leaves and coriander seeds.\n\nCurry powder is used as an incidental ingredient in other cuisines, including for example a \"curry sauce\" (''sauce au curry'', sometimes even ''au cari'') variation of the classic French [[b\u00e9chamel]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Curry Awards]]\n* [[Fish curry (disambiguation)|Fish curry]]\n* [[Mutton curry]]\n* [[Rice and curry]]\n* [[Shrimp curry]]\n\n* [[The British Curry Awards]]\n* [[The Curry Club]]\n* [[Wrap roti]]\n{{div col end}}\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Chicken makhani.jpg|right|[[Butter chicken]] served in an Indian restaurant\nFile:Red roast duck curry.jpg|Red roast duck curry (hot and spicy) from [[Thailand]]\nFile:Rice and chenopodium album leaf curry with potatoes and onions40.JPG|[[Rice]] and ''[[Chenopodium album]]'' leaf curry with onions and potatoes; a [[vegetarian]] curry\nFile:Homemade chicken tikka masala.jpg|Homemade [[chicken tikka masala]]\nFile:Balti gosht.jpg|A Balti lamb curry\nFile:Kadhi Chawal from India.jpg|yoghurt and gram flour curry\nFile:Vindalho.jpg|Pork Vindaloo in a Goan restaurant\nFile:Karnatakadishes.jpg|Karnataka Food\nFile:Rogan josh02.jpg|Rogan Josh curry\nFile:Chicken Curry 1.JPG|[[Curry chicken]] from Pakistan\nFile:Nihari.JPG|Nihari with nihari salad\nFile:Korean curry rice.jpg|Korean Curry rice\nFile:Kaeng kari kai.JPG|Yellow Curry\nFile:Meen curry 2.JPG|IndiaFish Curry \n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Piatkus.

As [[working animal]]s, camels&mdash;which are uniquely suited to their desert habitats&mdash;are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. There are three surviving species of camel.

This ... has generated extensive discussion regarding the date of the earliest domestic camel in the southern Levant (and beyond) (e.g., Albright 1949: 207; Epstein 1971: 558\u2013584; Bulliet 1975; Zarins 1989; K\u00f6hler-Rollefson 1993; Uerpmann and Uerpmann 2002; Jasmin 2005; 2006; Heide 2010; Rosen and Saidel 2010; Grigson 2012).

The data indicate that this event occurred not earlier than the last third of the 10th century [BC] and most probably during this time. The coincidence of this event with a major reorganization of the copper industry of the region\u2014attributed to the results of the campaign of Pharaoh [[Shoshenq I]]\u2014raises the possibility that the two were connected, and that camels were introduced as part of the efforts to improve efficiency by facilitating trade.<ref name=\"Sapir-Hen 2013 277\u2013285\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Textiles===\n{{Main|Camel hair}}\nDesert tribes and Mongolian nomads use camel hair for tents, [[yurt]]s, clothing, bedding and accessories.

When his arrangements were complete, he gave his troops orders to slay all the other Lydians who came in their way without mercy, but to spare Croesus and not kill him, even if he should be seized and offer resistance. The reason why Cyrus opposed his camels to the enemy's horse was because the horse has a natural dread of the camel, and cannot abide either the sight or the smell of that animal. By this stratagem he hoped to make Croesus's horse useless to him, the horse being what he chiefly depended on for victory. The two armies then joined battle, and immediately the Lydian war-horses, seeing and smelling the camels, turned round and galloped off; and so it came to pass that all Croesus's hopes withered away. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121201230133/http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.html | archivedate = 1 December 2012 | df =  }}</ref><ref name=\"historygroup-nz\">{{cite web | publisher = History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage | title = Cameliers and camels at war | work = New Zealand History online | accessdate = 5 December 2012 | date = 30 August 2009 | url = http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/camel-corps | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/67k0AH48W?url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/camel-corps | archivedate = 18 May 2012 | df =  }}</ref>\n\n====19th and 20th centuries====\n[[File:Camels on the way to Catalca, 1912.jpg|thumb|alt= A photo of Bulgarian military-transport camels in 1912|A [[camel train|camel caravan]] of the [[Military of Bulgaria|Bulgarian military]] during the [[First Balkan War]], 1912]]\nThe [[United States Army]] established the [[U.S. Camel Corps]], stationed in [[California]], in the late 19th century.<ref name=sandiegozoo /> One may still see stables at the [[Benicia Arsenal]] in [[Benicia, California]], where they nowadays serve as the Benicia Historical Museum.<ref name=\"military-museum\">{{cite web | publisher = The California State Military Museum | title = The Posts at Benicia | accessdate = 4 December 2012 | url = http://www.militarymuseum.org/Benicia.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120928195539/http://www.militarymuseum.org/Benicia.html | archivedate = 28 September 2012 | df =  }}</ref> Though the experimental use of camels was seen as a success ([[John B.

The earliest waves consisted of [[Suteans]] and [[Arameans]], followed a century or so later by the ''Kaldu'', a group who became known later as the ''Chaldeans'' or the ''Chaldees''. The [[Hebrew Bible]] uses the term {{lang|he|\u05db\u05e9\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd}} (''Ka\u015bdim'') and this is translated as Chaldaeans in the [[Septuagint]], although there is some dispute as to whether ''Kasdim'' in fact means Chaldean or refers to the south Mesopotamian Kaldu. These migrations did not affect the powerful kingdom of [[Assyria]] in the northern half of Mesopotamia, which repelled these incursions.\n\nThe short-lived 11th dynasty of the [[Kings of Babylon]] (6th century BC) is conventionally known{{Citation needed|reason=See Talk|date=January 2018}} to historians as the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire#Neo-Babylonian dynasty|Chaldean Dynasty]], although the last rulers, [[Nabonidus]] and his son [[Belshazzar]], were from Assyria.<ref>Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq''</ref>\n\nThese nomad Chaldeans settled in the far southeastern portion of Babylonia, chiefly on the left bank of the [[Euphrates]]. Though for a short time the name later commonly referred to the whole of southern Mesopotamia in Hebraic literature, this was a geographical and historical misnomer, as Chaldea proper was in fact only the plain in the far southeast formed by the deposits of the Euphrates and the [[Tigris]], extending about four hundred miles along the course of these rivers, and averaging about a hundred miles in width.\n{{anchor|Etymology|Names}}\n\n==Name==\nThe names ''Chaldea'' and ''Chaldaea'' are [[Latinisation of names|latinization]]s of the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''{{transl|grc|Khalda\u00eda}}'' ({{lang|grc|\u03a7\u03b1\u03bb\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03b1}}), a [[hellenization]] of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''{{transl|akk|m\u0101t Kaldu}}'' or ''{{transl|akk|Ka\u0161du}}''. The name appears in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in the [[Bible]] as ''{{transl|he|Ka\u015bdim}}'' ({{lang|he|\u05db\u05e9\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd}}){{sfn|McCurdy|Rogers|1902|pp=661-662}} and in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] as ''{{transl|arc|Kaldo}}'' ({{lang|arc|\u071f\u0720\u0715\u0718}}). Its inhabitants are called Chaldeans. The Hebrew word first appears in the Bible alongside [[Urfa]] as [[Arphaxad|Arfa-ksad]] (\u05d0\u05e8\u05e4\u05be\u05db\u05e9\u05d3), the City of the Chaldeans (\u05d0\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8 \u05db\u05b7\u05bc\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd), and as one of the five original [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semitic]] nations of the Bible, which include [[Lud, son of Shem|Lud]], [[Biblical Elam|Elam]], [[Ashur]] and [[Aram, son of Shem|Aram]]. [[Jews|Jewish]] Historian [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] also corroborates the link between [[Arpachshad|Arphaxad]] and Chaldea, in his [[Antiquities of the Jews]], stating, <blockquote>\u201cArphaxad named the Arphaxadites, who are now called Chaldeans.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0146:book=1:section=143&highlight=chaldeans|title=Antiquities of the Jews|last=Josephus|first=Flavius|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Book 1, section 143}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Land==\nIn the early period, between the early 9th century and late 7th century BC, ''mat Kaldi'' was the name of a small sporadically independent migrant-founded territory under the domination of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911-605 BC) in southeastern Babylonia, extending to the western shores of the [[Persian Gulf]].{{sfn|McCurdy|Rogers|1902|pp=661-662}}  \n\nThe expression ''mat Bit Y\u00e2kin'' is also used, apparently synonymously.\n''Bit Y\u00e2kin'' was the name of the largest and most powerful of the five tribes of the Chaldeaens, or equivalently, their territory.<ref>''bit'' is the \"house of\" tribal denominator, ''Y\u00e2kin'' (''Ia-kin'') is presumably the name of a king of the Arabian Sealand. Sargon mentions ''Yakini'' as the name of the [[Marduk-Baladan]]'s father. G. W. Bromiley (ed.), ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' (1995), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=Zkla5Gl_66oC&pg=PA325  p. 325].</ref>\nThe original extension of ''Bit Y\u00e2kin'' is not known precisely, but it extended from the lower Tigris into Arabia. [[Sargon II]] mentions it as extending as far as [[Dilmun]] or \"sea-land\" (littoral Eastern Arabia).<ref>Raymond Philip Dougherty, ''The Sealand of Ancient Arabia'', Yale University Press, 1932, 66ff.</ref>\n\"Chaldea\" or ''mat Kaldi'' generally referred to the low, marshy, alluvial land around the estuaries of the Tigris and Euphrates, which at the time discharged their waters through separate mouths into the sea. \n\nThe tribal capital ''Dur Y\u00e2kin'' was the original seat of [[Marduk-Baladan]].<ref>Trevor Bryce, ''The Routledge Handbook of the Peoples and Places of Ancient Western Asia: From the Early Bronze Age to the Fall of the Persian Empire'' (2009), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=QD9GrxiILH8C&pg=PA130  p. 130].</ref>\n\nThe king of Chaldea was also called the king of Bit Yakin, just as the kings of Babylonia and Assyria were regularly styled simply king of [[Babylon]] or [[Assur]], the capital city in each case. In the same way, what is now known as the Persian Gulf was sometimes called \"the Sea of Bit Yakin\", and sometimes \"the Sea of the Land of Chaldea\".\n\n\"Chaldea\" came to be used in a wider sense, of Mesopotamia in general, following the ascendancy \nof the Chaldeans during 608&ndash;557 BC. This is especially the case in the [[Hebrew Bible]], which\nwas substantially composed during this period (roughly corresponding to the period of [[Babylonian captivity]]). The [[Book of Jeremiah]] makes frequent reference to the Chaldeans (KJV ''Chaldees'' following [[LXX]] {{lang|grc|\u03a7\u03b1\u03bb\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03b9}}; in Biblical Hebrew as ''Kasd\u00eey(m\u00e2h)'' {{lang|he|\u05db\u05b7\u05bc\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05de\u05b8\u05d4}} \"[[Kassites]]\"). \n[[Habbakuk]] 1:6 calls them  \"that bitter and hasty nation\" ({{lang|he|\u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05b9\u05bc\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05b7\u05de\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b7\u05e0\u05b4\u05bc\u05de\u05b0\u05d4\u05b8\u05e8}}).\n\n==The Chaldean tribes==\nUnlike the [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-speaking [[Akkadians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]], whose ancestors had been established in Mesopotamia since at least the 30th century BC, the Chaldeans were not a native Mesopotamian people, but were late 10th or early 9th century BC [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] [[Levant]]ine migrants to the south eastern corner of the region, who had played no part in the previous 3,000 years or so of [[Sumero-Akkadian]] and [[Assyro-Babylonian]] [[Mesopotamian civilization]] and history.<ref>F Leo Oppenheim \u2013 Ancient Mesopotamia</ref><ref>Georges Roux \u2013 Ancient Iraq</ref>\n\nThe ancient Chaldeans seem to have migrated into Mesopotamia sometime between c. 940\u2013860 BC, a century or so after other new [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semitic arrivals]], the [[Arameans]] and the [[Suteans]], appeared in Babylonia, c. 1100 BC. They first appear in [[Recorded history|written record]] in the annals of the Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser III]] during the 850s BC. This was a period of weakness in Babylonia, and its ineffectual native kings were unable to prevent new waves of semi-nomadic foreign peoples from invading and settling in the land.<ref>F. Leo Oppenheim, ''Ancient Mesopotamia''</ref>\n\nThough belonging to the same West Semitic speaking ethnic group and migrating from the same Levantine regions as the earlier arriving Aramaeans, they are to be differentiated; the Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]], for example, carefully distinguishes them in his inscriptions.\n\nThe Chaldeans were rapidly and completely assimilated into the dominant Assyro-Babylonian culture, as was the case for the earlier [[Amorites]], [[Kassites]] and Suteans before them. By the time Babylon fell in 539 BC, the Chaldean tribes had already disappeared as a distinct race, becoming completely absorbed into the general population of southern Mesopotamia, and the term \"Chaldean\" was no longer used or relevant in describing a specific ethnicity or race of men. However, the term lingered in some quarters until the [[Seleucid]] period, after which it disappeared, but this later term was used only in relation to a socio-economic class of astrologers with no ethnic implications, and not a race of people or land. The nation of Chaldea in southeast Mesopotamia seems to have disappeared even before the fall of Babylon, and the succeeding [[Achaemenid Empire]] (546\u2013332 BC) did not retain a province or land called Chaldea, and made no mention of a Chaldean race in its annals.\n\nThe Chaldeans originally spoke a [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] language similar to but distinct from Aramaic. However, they eventually adopted the [[Akkadian language]] of the Assyrians and Babylonians. During the [[Assyrian Empire]], the Assyrian king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] introduced an [[Eastern Aramaic]] dialect as the [[lingua franca]] of his empire in the mid-8th century BC. As a result of this innovation, in late periods both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of Akkadian became marginalised, and [[Mesopotamian]] Aramaic took its place across Mesopotamia, including among the Chaldeans. This language in the form of [[Eastern Aramaic]] neo-Aramaic dialects still remains the mother-tongue of the now Christian Assyrian people of northern Iraq, north-east Syria, south-eastern Turkey and north-western Iran to this day.\n\nOne form of this once widespread language is used in Daniel and Ezra, but the use of the name \"Chaldee\" to describe it, first introduced by [[Jerome]], is linguistically incorrect and a misnomer.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the prophet [[Abraham]] is stated to have originally come from \"[[Ur of the Chaldees]]\" ([[Ur Ka\u015bdim]]). If this city is identified with the ancient [[Sumer]]ian [[city state]] of [[Ur]], it would be within what would only ''many centuries later'' become the Chaldean homeland south of the Euphrates.\n\nHowever, it must be pointed out that no evidence has been discovered indicating that the Chaldeans existed in Mesopotamia (or anywhere else in historical record) at the time Abraham (circa 1800\u20131700 BC) lived, the evidence instead shows the Chaldeans as arriving some eight or nine hundred years later.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=18-19}}. Thus the Biblical text in relation to Abraham and Ur of the Chaldees is in actuality a [[retrospective]] use of the term, used simply because at the time these Talmudic/Biblical texts were written down in the 6th century BC in Babylon, the Chaldean dynasty was then in power in Babylonia. The traditional identification with a site in Assyria (a nation in [[Upper Mesopotamia]] predating Chaldea by well over thirteen hundred years, and never recorded in historical annals as ever having been inhabited by the much later arriving Chaldeans) would then imply the much later sense of \"Babylonia\".\n\nSome interpreters have additionally identified Abraham's birthplace with [[Chaldia]] in Anatolia on the [[Black Sea]], a distinct region utterly unrelated geographically, culturally and ethnically to the southeast Mesopotamian Chaldea. According to the ''[[Book of Jubilees]]'', Ur Ka\u015bdim (and Chaldea) took their names from Ura and Kesed, descendants of [[Arpachshad]].{{sfn|Dever|2002|p=98 and fn. 2}}\n\n===Modern Chaldean Christians===\nThe term \"Chaldean\" has fairly recently been revived, initially to describe those Assyrians who broke from the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries and entered communion with the [[Catholic Church]]. This is a historic, ethnic and geographic inaccuracy. After initially calling it \"The Church of Assyria and Mosul\" in 1553 AD and designating its first leader as the \"Patriarch of the East Assyrians\", it was later renamed the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] in 1683. However, this line also reverted to the original Assyrian church, whereas the modern Chaldean Catholic Church was only founded in northern Mesopotamia 1830. The term \"Chaldean Catholic\" should thus be understood purely as a [[Christian denomination]] (much like [[Baptist]] or [[Anglican]]) rather than a racial, ethnic or historical term, as the modern Chaldean Catholics are accepted as Assyrian people,<ref>From a lecture by J. A. Brinkman: \"There is no reason to believe that there would be no racial or cultural continuity in Assyria, since there is no evidence that the population of Assyrians were removed.\" Quoted in Efram Yildiz's \"The Assyrians\" Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, 13.1, p. 22, ref 24</ref> later converts to Catholicism, and long indigenous to the [[Assyrian homeland]] in northern Mesopotamia, rather than relating to long extinct Chaldeans who hailed from the Levant and settled in the far southeastern parts Mesopotamia before wholly disappearing during the sixth century BC. There has been no accredited  study nor historical, archaeological, linguistic, genetic, geographic or anthropological evidence that links the modern Chaldean Catholics of northern Iraq to the ancient Chaldeans of southeastern Iraq. The evidence points clearly to their being one and the same people as, and hailing from the same region as, the Assyrians. In other words, they are in fact a part of the [[Assyrian continuity]].\n\nThe naming by Rome is believed to be due to a misinterpretation of the term ''Ur Kasdim'', the supposed north Mesopotamian birthplace of Abraham in Hebraic tradition as ''Ur of the Chaldees'', and a reluctance to use the earlier terms, such as Assyrians, East Assyrians, East Syrians and Nestorians, due to their connotations with the Assyrian Church of the East and [[Syriac Orthodox Church]].<ref>Biblical Archaeology Review May/June 2001: Where Was Abraham's Ur?.</ref>\n\nIt is noteworthy that the term \"Chaldeans\" already had a long history of misapplication by Rome,<ref>Council of Florence, Bull of union with the Chaldeans and the Maronites of Cyprus Session 14, 7 August 1445 [1]</ref> having been previously officially used by the Council of Florence in 1445 AD as a new name for a group of [[Greeks|Greek]] Nestorians of [[Cyprus]] who entered in Full Communion with the Catholic Church. Rome then used the term Chaldeans to indicate the members of the ''Church of the East in Communion with Rome'' primarily in order to avoid the terms ''Nestorian'', ''Assyrian'' and ''Syriac'', which were theologically unacceptable, having connotations to churches doctrinally and politically at odds with The Vatican. This was also done in 1681 AD for Joseph I and later, after his line reverted to the Assyrian church, in 1830 AD when Yohannan Hormizd, of the line of [[Alqosh]], became the first so called \"Patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans\" of the modern Chaldean Catholic Church. In addition, Rome had also long inaccurately used the name ''Chaldea'' to designate the completely unrelated [[Chaldia]] in [[Asia Minor]] on the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Neo-Babylonian Empire}}\nThe region that the Chaldeans eventually made their homeland was in relatively poor southeastern Mesopotamia, at the head of the Persian Gulf. They appear to have migrated into southern Babylonia from the Levant at some unknown point between the end of the reign of [[Ninurta-kudurri-usur II]] (a contemporary of [[Tiglath-Pileser II]]) circa 940 BC, and the start of the reign of [[Marduk-zakir-shumi I]] in 855 BC, although there is no historical proof of their existence prior to the late 850s BC.<ref>Georges Roux \u2013 Ancient Iraq p. 298</ref>\n\nFor perhaps a century or so after settling in the area, these semi-nomadic migrant Chaldean tribes had no impact on the pages of history, seemingly remaining subjugated by the native Akkadian speaking kings of Babylon or by perhaps regionally influential Aramean tribes. The main players in southern Mesopotamia during this period were Babylonia and Assyria, together with [[Elam]] to the east and the Aramaeans, who had already settled in the region a century or so prior to the arrival of the Chaldeans.\n\nThe very first ''written historical attestation'' of the existence of Chaldeans occurs in 852 BC,<ref>A. K. Grayson (1996). Assyrian Rulers of the Early First Millennium BC II (858\u2013745 B.C.) (RIMA 3). Toronto University Press. pp. 31, 26\u201328. iv 6</ref> in the annals of the Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser III]], who mentions invading the southeastern extremes of Babylonia and subjugating one [[Mushallim-Marduk]], the chief of the [[Amukani]] tribe and overall leader of the Kaldu tribes,<ref>Door fitting from the [[Balawat]] Gates, BM 124660.</ref> together with capturing the town of [[Baqani]], extracting tribute from [[Adini]], chief of the [[Bet-Dakkuri]], another Chaldean tribe.\n\nShalmanesser III had invaded Babylonia at the request of its own king, [[Marduk-zakir-shumi I]], the Babylonian king being threatened by his own rebellious relations, together with powerful Aramean tribes pleaded with the more powerful Assyrian king for help. The subjugation of the Chaldean tribes by the Assyrian king appears to have been an aside, as they were not at that time a powerful force, or a threat to the native Babylonian king.\n\nImportant Kaldu regions in southeastern Babylonia were [[Bit-Y\u00e2kin]] (the original area the Chaldeans settled in on the Persian Gulf), [[Bet-Dakuri]], [[Bet-Adini]], [[Bet-Amukkani]], and [[Bet-Shilani]].\n\nChaldean leaders had by this time already adopted Assyro-Babylonian names, religion, language and customs, indicating that they had become Akkadianized to a great degree.\n\nThe Chaldeans remained quietly ruled by the native Babylonians (who were in turn subjugated by their Assyrian relations) for the next seventy-two years, only coming to historical prominence for the first time in Babylonia in 780 BC, when a previously unknown Chaldean named [[Marduk-apla-usur]] usurped the throne from the native Babylonian king [[Marduk-bel-zeri]] (790\u2013780 BC). The latter was a vassal of the Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser IV]] (783\u2013773 BC), who was otherwise occupied quelling a civil war in Assyria at the time.\n\nThis was to set a precedent for all future Chaldean aspirations on Babylon during the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]]; always too weak to confront a strong Assyria alone and directly, the Chaldeans awaited periods when Assyrian kings were distracted elsewhere in their vast empire, or engaged in internal conflicts, then, in alliance with other powers stronger than themselves (usually [[Elam]]), they made a bid for control over Babylonia.\n\nShalmaneser IV attacked and defeated Marduk-apla-usur, retaking northern Babylonia and forcing on him a border treaty in Assyria's favour. The Assyrians allowed him to remain on the throne, although subject to Assyria. [[Eriba-Marduk]], another Chaldean, succeeded him in 769 BC and his son, [[Nabu-shuma-ishkun]] in 761 BC, with both being dominated by the new Assyrian king [[Ashur-Dan III]] (772\u2013755 BC). Babylonia appears to have been in a state of chaos during this time, with the north occupied by Assyria, its throne occupied by foreign Chaldeans, and continual civil unrest throughout the land.\n\nChaldean rule proved short lived. A native Babylonian king named [[Nabonassar]] (748\u2013734 BC) defeated and overthrew the Chaldean usurpers in 748 BC, restored indigenous rule, and successfully stabilised Babylonia. The Chaldeans once more faded into obscurity for the next three decades. During this time both the Babylonians and the Chaldean and Aramean migrant groups who had settled in the land once more fell completely under the yoke of the powerful Assyrian king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] (745\u2013727 BC), a ruler who introduced [[Imperial Aramaic]] as the [[lingua franca]] of his empire. The Assyrian king at first made Nabonassar and his successor native Babylonian kings [[Nabu-nadin-zeri]], [[Nabu-suma-ukin II]] and [[Nabu-mukin-zeri]] his subjects, but decided ruled Babylonia directly from 729 BC. He was followed by [[Shalmaneser V]] (727\u2013722 BC), who also ruled Babylon in person.\n\nWhen [[Sargon II]] (722\u2013705 BC) ascended the throne of the Assyrian Empire in 722 BC after the death of Shalmaneser V, he was forced to launch a major campaign in his subject states of [[Persia]], [[Mannea]] and [[Media (region)|Media]] in [[Ancient Iran]] to defend his territories there. He defeated and drove out the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] who had attacked Assyria's Persian and [[Median]] vassal colonies in the region. At the same time, [[Egypt]] began encouraging and supporting rebellion against Assyria in [[Israel]] and [[Canaan]], forcing the Assyrians to send troops to deal with the Egyptians.\n\nThese events allowed the Chaldeans to once more attempt to assert themselves. While the Assyrian king was otherwise occupied defending his Iranian colonies from the Scythians and Cimmerians and driving the Egyptians from Canaan, [[Marduk-apla-iddina II]] (the Biblical [[Marduk-apla-iddina II|Merodach-Baladan]]) of Bit-Y\u00e2kin, allied himself with the powerful [[Elamite]] kingdom and the native Babylonians, briefly seizing control of Babylon between 721 and 710 BC. With the Scythians and Cimmerians vanquished, the Medes and Persians pledging loyalty, and the [[Egyptians]] defeated and ejected from southern Canaan, [[Sargon II]] was free at last to deal with the Chaldeans, Babylonians and Elamites. He attacked and deposed Marduk-apla-iddina II in 710 BC, also defeating his Elamite allies in the process. After defeat by the Assyrians, Merodach-Baladan fled to his protectors in Elam.\n\nIn 703, Merodach-Baladan very briefly regained the throne from a native [[Akkadian]]-Babylonian ruler [[Marduk-zakir-shumi II]], who was a puppet of the new Assyrian king, Sennacherib (705\u2013681 BC). He was once more soundly defeated at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], and once again fled to Elam where he died in exile after one final failed attempt to raise a revolt against Assyria in 700 BC, this time not in Babylon, but in the Chaldean tribal land of Bit-Y\u00e2kin. A native Babylonian king named [[Bel-ibni]] (703\u2013701 BC) was placed on the throne as a puppet of Assyria.\n\nThe next challenge to Assyrian domination came from the [[Elamites]] in 694 BC, with [[Nergal-ushezib]] deposing and murdering [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]] (700\u2013694 BC), the Assyrian prince who was king of Babylon and son of Sennacherib. The Chaldeans and Babylonians again allied with their more powerful Elamite neighbours in this endeavour. This prompted the enraged Assyrian king Sennacherib to invade and subjugate Elam and Chaldea and to sack Babylon, laying waste to and largely destroying the city. Babylon was regarded as a sacred city by all Mesopotamians, including the Assyrians, and this act eventually resulted to Sennacherib's being murdered by his own sons while he was praying to the god [[Nisroch]] in [[Nineveh]].\n\n[[Esarhaddon]] (681\u2013669 BC) succeeded Sennacherib as ruler of the Assyrian Empire. He completely rebuilt Babylon and brought peace to the region. He conquered Egypt, [[Nubia]] and [[Libya]] and entrenched his mastery over the Persians, Medes, Parthians, Scythians, Cimmerians, Arameans, Israelites, Phoenicians, Canaanites, Urartians, Pontic Greeks, Cilicians, Phrygians, Lydians, Manneans and Arabs. For the next 60 or so years Babylon and Chaldea remained peacefully under direct Assyrian control. The Chaldeans remained subjugated and quiet during this period, and the next major revolt in Babylon against the Assyrian empire was fermented not by a Chaldean, Babylonian or Elamite, but by [[Shamash-shum-ukin]], who was an Assyrian king of Babylon, and elder brother of [[Ashurbanipal]] (668-627 BC), the new ruler of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\n\n[[Shamash-shum-ukin]] (668\u2013648 BC) had become infused with Babylonian nationalism after sixteen years peacefully subject to his brother, and despite being Assyrian himself, declared that the city of Babylon and not Nineveh or Ashur should be the seat of the empire.\n\nIn 652 BC, he raised a powerful coalition of peoples resentful of their subjugation to Assyria against his own brother [[Ashurbanipal]]. The alliance included the Babylonians, [[Persia]]ns, Chaldeans, [[Medes]], [[Elamites]], Suteans, Arameans, [[Israelites]], [[Arabs]] and [[Canaanites]], together with some disaffected elements among the Assyrians themselves. After a bitter struggle lasting five years, the Assyrian king triumphed over his rebellious brother in 648 BC, Elam was utterly destroyed, and the Babylonians, Persians, Medes, Chaldeans, Arabs and others were savagely punished. An Assyrian governor named [[Kandalanu]] was then placed on the throne of Babylon to rule on behalf of Ashurbanipal. The next 22 years were peaceful, and neither the Babylonians nor Chaldeans posed a threat to the dominance of Ashurbanipal.\n\nHowever, after the death of the mighty [[Ashurbanipal]] (and Kandalanu) in 627 BC, the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] descended into a series of bitter internal dynastic civil wars that were to be the cause of its downfall.\n\n[[Ashur-etil-ilani]] (626\u2013623 BC) ascended to the throne of the empire in 626 BC, but was immediately engulfed in a torrent of fierce rebellions instigated by rival claimants. He was deposed in 623 BC by an Assyrian general (''turtanu'') named [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] (623\u2013622 BC), who was also declared king of Babylon. [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] (622\u2013612 BC), the brother of Ashur-etil-ilani, took back the throne of empire from Sin-shumu-lishir in 622 BC, but was then himself faced with unremitting rebellion against his rule by his own people. Continual conflict among the Assyrians led to a myriad of subject peoples, from [[Cyprus]] to Persia and [[The Caucasus]] to Egypt, quietly reasserting their independence and ceasing to pay tribute to Assyria.\n\n[[Nabopolassar]], a previously obscure and unknown Chaldean chieftain, followed the opportunistic tactics laid down by previous Chaldean leaders to take advantage of the chaos and anarchy gripping Assyria and Babylonia and seized the city of Babylon in 620 BC with the help of its native Babylonian inhabitants.\n\n[[Sin-shar-ishkun]] amassed a powerful army and marched into Babylon to regain control of the region. Nabopolassar was saved from likely destruction because yet another massive Assyrian rebellion broke out in Assyria proper, including the capital Nineveh, which forced the Assyrian king to turn back in order to quell the revolt. Nabopolassar took advantage of this situation, seizing the ancient city of [[Nippur]] in 619 BC, a mainstay of pro-Assyrianism in Babylonia, and thus Babylonia as a whole.\n\nHowever, his position was still far from secure, and bitter fighting continued in the Babylonian heartlands from 620 to 615 BC, with Assyrian forces encamped in Babylonia in an attempt to eject Nabopolassar. Nabopolassar attempted a counterattack, marched his army into Assyria proper in 616 BC, and tried to besiege Assur and [[Arrapha]] (modern [[Kirkuk]]), but was defeated by Sin-shar-ishkun and chased back into Babylonia after being driven from [[Idiqlat]] (modern [[Tikrit]]) at the southernmost end of Assyria. A stalemate seemed to have ensued, with Nabopolassar unable to make any inroads into Assyria despite its greatly weakened state, and Sin-shar-ishkun unable to eject Nabopolassar from Babylonia due to constant rebellions and civil war among his own people.\n\nNabopolassar's position, and the fate of the Assyrian empire, was sealed when he entered into an alliance with another of Assyria's former vassals, the Medes, the now dominant people of what was to become Persia. The Median [[Cyaxares]] had also recently taken advantage of the anarchy in the Assyrian Empire, while officially still a vassal of Assyria, he took the opportunity to meld the [[Iranian peoples]]; the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Sagartians]] and [[Parthia|Parthians]], into a large and powerful Median-dominated force. The Medes, Persians, Parthians, Chaldeans and Babylonians formed an alliance that also included the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] to the north.\n\nWhile Sin-shar-ishkun was fighting both the rebels in Assyria and the Chaldeans and Babylonians in southern Mesopotamia, [[Cyaxares]] (hitherto a vassal of Assyria), in alliance with the Scythians and Cimmerians launched a surprise attack on civil-war-bleaguered Assyria in 615 BC, sacking [[Kalhu]] (the Biblical [[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]) and taking [[Arrapkha]] (modern [[Kirkuk]]). Nabopolassar, still pinned down in southern Mesopotamia, was not involved in this major breakthrough against Assyria. From this point however, the alliance of Medes, Persians, Chaldeans, Babylonians, Sagartians, Scythians and Cimmerians fought in unison against Assyria.\n\nDespite the sorely depleted state of Assyria, bitter fighting ensued. Throughout 614 BC the alliance of powers continued to make inroads into Assyria itself, although in 613 BC the Assyrians somehow rallied to score a number of counterattacking victories over the Medes-Persians, Babylonians-Chaldeans and Scythians-Cimmerians. This led to a coalition of forces ranged against it to unite and launch a massive combined attack in 612 BC, finally besieging and sacking Nineveh in late 612 BC, killing [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] in the process.\n\nA new Assyrian king, [[Ashur-uballit II]] (612\u2013605 BC), took the crown amidst the house-to-house fighting in Nineveh, and refused a request to bow in vassalage to the rulers of the alliance. He managed to fight his way out of Nineveh and reach the northern Assyrian city of [[Harran]], where he founded a new capital. Assyria resisted for another seven years until 605 BC, when the remnants of the Assyrian army and the army of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]s (whose dynasty had also been installed as puppets of the Assyrians) were defeated at [[Karchemish]]. Nabopolassar and his Median, Scythian and Cimmerian allies were now in possession of much of the huge [[Neo Assyrian Empire]]. The Egyptians had belatedly come to the aid of Assyria, fearing that, without Assyrian protection, they would be the next to succumb to the new powers, having already been raided by the Scythians.\n\nThe Chaldean king of Babylon now ruled all of southern [[Mesopotamia]] (Assyria in the north was ruled by the Medes),<ref>Ran Zadok (1984), Assyrians in Chaldean and Achaemenians Babylonia. Page 2.</ref> and the former Assyrian possessions of [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] ([[Syria]]), [[Phoenicia]], Israel, [[Cyprus]], [[Edom]], [[Philistia]], and parts of [[Arabia]], while the Medes took control of the former Assyrian colonies in [[Ancient Iran]], [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Caucasus]].\n\nNabopolassar was not able to enjoy his success for long, dying in 604 BC, only one year after the victory at Karchemish. He was succeeded by his son, who took the name [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], after the unrelated 12th century BC native Akkadian-Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar I]], indicating the extent to which the migrant Chaldeans had become infused with native Mesopotamian culture.\n\n[[Nebuchadnezzar II]] and his allies may well have been forced to deal with remnants of Assyrian resistance based in and around [[Dur-Katlimmu]], as Assyrian imperial records continue to be dated in this region between 604 and 599 BC.<ref>Assyria 1995: Proceedings of the 10th Anniversary Symposium of the Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project / Helsinki, September 7\u201311, 1995.</ref> In addition, the Egyptians remained in the region, possibly in an attempt to aid their former Assyrian masters and to carve out an empire of their own.\n\nNebuchadnezzar II was to prove himself to be the greatest of the Chaldean rulers, rivaling another non-native ruler, the 18th century BC [[Amorite]] king [[Hammurabi]], as the greatest king of Babylon. He was a patron of the cities and a spectacular builder, rebuilding all of Babylonia's major cities on a lavish scale. His building activity at Babylon, expanding on the earlier major and impressive rebuilding of the Assyrian king [[Esarhaddon]], helped to turn it into the immense and beautiful city of legend. Babylon covered more than three square miles, surrounded by moats and ringed by a double circuit of walls. The Euphrates flowed through the center of the city, spanned by a beautiful stone bridge. At the center of the city rose the giant [[ziggurat]] called [[Etemenanki]], \"House of the Frontier Between Heaven and Earth,\" which lay next to the Temple of [[Marduk]]. He is also believed by many historians to have built [[The Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] (although others believe these gardens were built much earlier by an Assyrian king in Nineveh) for his wife, a [[Median]] princess from the green mountains, so that she would feel at home.\n\nA capable leader, Nebuchadnezzar II conducted successful military campaigns; cities like [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]] and [[Damascus]] were subjugated. He also conducted numerous campaigns in [[Asia Minor]] against the [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]], and [[Lydians]]. Like their Assyrian relations, the Babylonians had to campaign yearly in order to control their colonies.\n\nIn 601 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II was involved in a major but inconclusive battle against the [[Egyptians]]. In 599 BC, he invaded Arabia and routed the Arabs at [[Qedar]]. In 597 BC, he invaded [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], captured [[Jerusalem]], and deposed its king [[Jehoiachin]]. Egyptian and Babylonian armies fought each other for control of the Near East throughout much of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, and this encouraged king [[Zedekiah]] of Judah to revolt. After an eighteen-month siege, Jerusalem was captured in 587 BC, thousands of Jews were deported to Babylon, and Solomon's Temple was razed to the ground.\n\nNebuchadnezzar successfully fought the Pharaohs [[Psammetichus II]] and [[Apries]] throughout his reign, and during the reign of Pharaoh [[Amasis II|Amasis]] in 568 BC it is rumoured that he may have briefly invaded Egypt itself.\n\nBy 572, Nebuchadnezzar was in full control of Babylonia, Chaldea, [[Aramea]] ([[Syria]]), [[Phonecia]], Israel, [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Philistia]], [[Samarra]], [[Jordan]], northern Arabia, and parts of [[Asia Minor]]. Nebuchadnezzar died of illness in 562 BC after a one-year co-reign with his son, [[Amel-Marduk]], who was deposed in 560 BC after a reign of only two years.\n\n===End of the Chaldean dynasty===\n[[Neriglissar]] succeeded Amel-Marduk. It is unclear as to whether he was in fact an ethnic Chaldean or a native Babylonian nobleman, as he was not related by blood to Nabopolassar's descendants, having married into the ruling family. He conducted successful military campaigns against the [[Greeks|Hellenic]] inhabitants of [[Cilicia]], which had threatened Babylonian interests. Neriglissar reigned for only four years and was succeeded by the youthful [[Labashi-Marduk]] in 556 BC. Again, it is unclear whether he was a Chaldean or a native Babylonian.\n\nLabashi-Marduk reigned only for a matter of months, being deposed by [[Nabonidus]] in late 556 BC. Nabonidus was certainly not a Chaldean, but an Assyrian from [[Harran]], the last capital of Assyria, and proved to be the final native Mesopotamian king of Babylon. He and his son, the regent [[Belshazzar]], were deposed by the Persians under Cyrus II in 539 BC.\n\nWhen the Babylonian Empire was absorbed into the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]], the name \"Chaldean\" lost its meaning in reference a particular ethnicity or land, but lingered for a while as a term solely and explicitly used to describe a societal class of astrologers and astronomers in southern Mesopotamia. The original Chaldean tribe had long ago became Akkadianized, adopting Akkadian culture, religion, language and customs, blending into the majority native population, and eventually wholly disappearing as a distinct race of people, as had been the case with other preceding migrant peoples, such as the Amorites, Kassites, Suteans and Arameans of Babylonia.\n\nThe Persians considered this ''Chaldean societal class'' to be masters of reading and writing, and especially versed in all forms of incantation, sorcery, witchcraft, and the magical arts. They spoke of astrologists and astronomers as ''Chaldeans'', and it is used with this specific meaning in the [[Book of Daniel]] (Dan. i. 4, ii. 2 et seq.) and by classical writers, such as [[Strabo]].\n\nThe disappearance of the Chaldeans as an ethnicity and Chaldea as a land is evidenced by the fact that the Persian rulers of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539\u2013330 BC) did not retain a province called \"Chaldea\", nor did they refer to \"Chaldeans\" as a race of people in their written annals. This is in contrast to Assyria, and for a time Babylonia also, where the Persians retained the names Assyria and Babylonia as designations for distinct [[geo-political]] entities within the Achaemenid Empire. In the case of the Assyrians in particular, Achaemenid records show Assyrians holding important positions within the empire, particularly with regards to military and civil administration.<ref>\"Assyrians after Assyria\". Nineveh.com. 4 September 1999. Archived from the original on 14 July 2011. Retrieved 19 June 2011.</ref>\n\nThis absence of Chaldeans from the historical record continues throughout the [[Macedonian Empire]], [[Seleucid Empire]], [[Parthian Empire]], [[Roman Empire]], [[Sassanid Empire]], [[Byzantine Empire]] and after the [[Arab Islamic conquest]] and [[Mongol Empire]].\n\nBy the time of [[Cicero]] in the 2nd century BC, \"Chaldean\" appears to have completely disappeared even as a societal term for Babylonian astronomers and astrologers; Cicero refers to \"Babylonian astrologers\" rather than Chaldean astrologers.<ref>Cicero, Pro Murena, ch. 21</ref> [[Horace]] does the same, referring to \"Babylonian horoscopes\" rather than Chaldean<ref>Horace, Odes 1.11</ref> in his famous [[Carpe Diem]] ode. Cicero views the Babylonian astrologers as holding obscure knowledge, while Horace thinks that they are wasting their time and would be happier \"going with the flow\".\n\nThe terms Chaldee and Chaldean were henceforth only found only in Hebraic and [[Biblical]] sources dating from the 6th and 5th centuries BC, and referring specifically to the period of the Chaldean Dynasty of Babylon.\n\nAfter an absence from history of 2,236 years, the name was revived in 1683 AD by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the form of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] as the new name for the \"Church of Assyria and Mosul\" (so named in 1553 AD). This was a church founded and populated not by the long extinct Chaldean tribe of southeastern Mesopotamia, who had disappeared from the pages of history over twenty two centuries previously, but founded in northern Mesopotamia by a breakaway group of ethnic Assyrians long indigenous to [[Upper Mesopotamia]] (Assyria) who had hitherto been members of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] before entering communion with Rome.<ref>George V.

For example, a function that takes two arguments, one from ''X'' and one from ''Y'', and produces outputs in ''Z,'' by currying is translated into a function that takes a single argument from ''X'' and produces as outputs ''functions'' from ''Y'' to ''Z.'' Currying is related to, but not the same as, [[partial application]].\n\nCurrying is useful in both practical and theoretical settings. In [[functional programming language]]s, and many others, it provides a way of automatically managing how arguments are passed to functions and exceptions. In [[theoretical computer science]], it provides a way to study functions with multiple arguments in simpler theoretical models which provide only one argument. The most general setting for the strict notion of currying and uncurrying is in the [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal categories]], which underpins a vast generalization of the [[Curry\u2013Howard correspondence]] of proofs and programs to a correspondence with many other structures, including quantum mechanics, cobordisms and string theory.<ref name=\"rosetta\"/>  It was introduced by [[Gottlob Frege]],<ref>[[Willard Van Orman Quine]], introduction to \"Bausteine der mathematischen Logik\", pp.&nbsp;305&ndash;316.

It takes a [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>f</math> whose return value is another function <math>g</math>, and yields a new function <math>f'</math> that takes as parameters the arguments for both <math>f</math> and <math>g</math>, and returns, as a result, the application of <math>f</math> and subsequently, <math>g</math>, to those arguments.  The process can be iterated.\n\n==Motivation==\nCurrying provides a way for working with functions that take multiple arguments, and using them in frameworks where functions might take only one argument. For example, some [[#Definition|analytical techniques]] can only be applied to [[function (mathematics)|function]]s with a single argument. Practical functions frequently take more arguments than this. [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] showed that it was sufficient to provide solutions for the single argument case, as it was possible to transform a function with multiple arguments into a chain of single-argument functions instead. This transformation is the process now known as currying.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/faq.html#currying|title=Frequently Asked Questions for comp.lang.functional: Currying|author=Graham Hutton|work=nott.ac.uk}}</ref> All \"ordinary\" functions that might typically be encountered in [[mathematical analysis]] or in [[computer programming]] can be curried.  However, there are categories in which currying is not possible; the most general categories which allow currying are the [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal categories]].\n\nSome [[programming language]]s almost always use curried functions to achieve multiple arguments; notable examples are [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], where in both cases all functions have exactly one argument. This property is inherited from [[lambda calculus]], where multi-argument functions are usually represented in curried form.\n\nCurrying is related to, but not the same as [[partial application]]. In practice, the programming technique of [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]] can be used to perform partial application and a kind of currying, by hiding arguments in an environment that travels with the curried function.\n\n=== Illustration ===\nSuppose we have a function  <math>f:\\Bbb{R}\\times\\Bbb{R}\\to\\Bbb{R}</math> which takes two real arguments and outputs real numbers, and it is defined by <math>f(x,y)=x+y^2</math>. Currying translates this into a function  <math>h</math> which takes a single real argument and outputs functions from  <math>\\Bbb{R}</math> to  <math>\\Bbb{R}</math>. In symbols,  <math>h:\\Bbb{R}\\to\\Bbb{R}^\\Bbb{R}</math>, where <math>\\Bbb{R}^\\Bbb{R}</math>denotes the set of all functions that take a single real argument and produce real outputs.   For every real number <math>x</math>, define the function <math>h_x : \\Bbb{R}\\to\\Bbb{R}</math> by <math>h_x(y)=x+y^2</math>, and then define the function <math>h:\\Bbb{R}\\to\\Bbb{R}^\\Bbb{R}</math> by <math>h(x)=h_x</math>. So for instance, <math>h(2)</math> is the function that sends its real argument <math>y</math> to the output <math>2+y^2</math>, or <math>h(2)(y)=h_2(y)=2+y^2</math>. We see that in general \n\n:<math>h(x)(y)=x+y^2=f(x,y)</math>\n\nso that the original function <math>f</math> and its currying <math>h</math> convey exactly the same information. In this situation, we also write \n\n:<math>\\text{curry}(f) = h.</math>\n\nThis also works for functions with more than two arguments. If <math>f</math> were a function of three arguments <math>f(x,y,z)</math>, its currying <math>h</math> would have the property\n\n:<math>f(x,y,z)=h(x)(y)(z).</math>\n\n== History ==\nThe name \"currying\", coined by [[Christopher Strachey]] in 1967, is a reference to logician [[Haskell Curry]].  The alternative name \"Sch\u00f6nfinkelisation\" has been proposed as a reference to [[Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel]].<ref>I. Heim and A. Kratzer (1998). ''Semantics in Generative Grammar''. Blackwell.</ref>  In the mathematical context, the principle can be traced back to work in 1893 by [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]].\n\n== Definition ==\nCurrying is most easily understood by starting with an informal definition, which can then be molded to fit many different domains. First, there is some notation to be established.  The notation <math>X \\to Y </math> denotes all [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from <math>X</math> to <math>Y</math>.  If <math>f</math>  is such a function, we write  <math>f \\colon X \\to Y </math>.  Let <math>X \\times Y</math> denote the [[ordered pair]]s of the elements of <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> respectively, that is, the [[Cartesian product]] of <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>. Here, <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> may be sets, or they may be types, or they may be other kinds of objects, as explored below. \n\nGiven a function\n\n:<math>f \\colon (X \\times Y) \\to Z </math>, \n\n'''currying''' constructs a new function\n\n:<math>h \\colon X \\to (Y \\to Z) </math>. \n\nThat is, <math>h </math> takes an argument from <math>X</math> and returns a function that maps <math>Y</math> to <math>Z</math>. It is defined by\n\n:<math>h(x)(y)=f(x,y)</math>\n\nfor <math>x</math> from <math>X</math> and <math>y</math> from <math>Y</math>. We then also write\n\n:<math>\\text{curry}(f)=h.</math>\n\n'''Uncurrying''' is the reverse transformation, and is most easily understood in terms of its right adjoint, the [[apply|function <math>\\operatorname{apply}.</math>]]\n\n=== Set theory ===\nIn [[set theory]], the notation <math>Y^X</math> is used to denote the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of functions from the set <math>X</math> to the set <math>Y</math>. Currying is the [[natural equivalence|natural bijection]] between the set <math>A^{B\\times C}</math> of functions from <math>B\\times C</math> to <math>A</math>, and the set <math>(A^C)^B</math> of functions from <math>B</math> to the set of functions from <math>C</math> to <math>A</math>.  In symbols:\n\n:<math>A^{B\\times C}\\cong (A^C)^B</math>\n\nIndeed, it is this natural bijection that justifies the [[exponential notation]] for the set of functions. As is the case in all instances of currying, the formula above describes an [[Adjoint functors|adjoint pair of functors]]: for every fixed set <math>C</math>, the functor <math>B\\mapsto B\\times C</math> is left adjoint to the functor <math>A \\mapsto A^C</math>.\n\nIn the [[category of sets]], the [[Mathematical object|object]] <math>Y^X</math> is called the [[exponential object]].\n\n=== Function spaces ===\nIn the theory of [[function space]]s, such as in [[functional analysis]] or [[homotopy theory]], one is commonly interested in [[continuous function]]s between [[topological space]]s. One writes <math>\\text{Hom}(X,Y)</math> (the [[Hom functor]]) for the set of ''all'' functions from <math>X</math> to <math>Y</math>, and uses the notation <math>Y^X</math> to denote the subset of continuous functions. Here, <math>\\text{curry}</math> is the [[bijection]]\n\n:<math>\\text{curry}:\\text{Hom}(X\\times Y, Z) \\to \\text{Hom}(X, \\text{Hom}(Y,Z)) ,</math>\n\nwhile uncurrying is the inverse map. If the set <math>Y^X</math> of continuous functions from <math>X</math> to <math>Y</math> is given the [[compact-open topology]], and if the space <math>Y</math> is [[locally compact Hausdorff]], then\n\n:<math>\\text{curry} : Z^{X\\times Y}\\to (Z^Y)^X</math> \n\nis a [[homeomorphism]].  This is also the case when <math>X</math>, <math>Y</math> and <math>Y^X</math> are [[Compactly generated space|kaonized]],<ref name=\"may\">J.P. May, ''[http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/CONCISE/ConciseRevised.pdf A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology]'', (1999) Chicago Lectures in Mathematics {{ISBN|0-226-51183-9}}</ref>{{rp|at=chapter 5}}<ref>{{nlab|id=compactly+generated+topological+space|title=Compactly generated topological space}}</ref> although there are more cases.<ref>P.

Another important result is that the [[apply|application map]], usually called \"evaluation\" in this context, is continuous (note that [[eval]] is a strictly different concept in computer science.) That is,\n\n<math>\\begin{align} &&\\text{eval}:Y^X \\times X \\to Y \\\\\n                     && (f,x) \\mapsto f(x) \\end{align}</math>\n\nis continuous when <math>Y^X</math> is compact-open and <math>Y</math> locally compact Hausdorff.<ref name=rotman>Joseph J. Rotman, ''An Introduction to Algebraic Topology'' (1988) Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|0-387-96678-1}} ''(See Chapter 11 for proof.)''</ref> These two results are central for establishing the continuity of [[homotopy]], i.e. when <math>X</math> is the unit interval <math>I</math>, so that <math>Z^{I\\times Y} \\cong (Z^Y)^I</math> can the thought of as either a homotopy of two functions from <math>Y</math> to <math>Z</math>, or, equivalently, a single (continuous) path in <math>Z^Y</math>.\n\n=== Algebraic topology ===\nIn [[algebraic topology]], currying serves as an example of [[Eckmann\u2013Hilton duality]], and, as such, plays an important role in a variety of different settings. For example, [[loop space]] is adjoint to [[reduced suspension]]s; this is commonly written as\n:<math>[\\Sigma X,Z] \\approxeq [X, \\Omega Z]</math>\nwhere <math>[A,B]</math> is the set of [[homotopy class]]es of maps <math>A \\rightarrow B</math>, and <math>\\Sigma A</math> is the [[Suspension (topology)|suspension]] of ''A'', and <math>\\Omega A</math> is the [[loop space]] of ''A''.  In essence, the suspension <math>\\Sigma X</math> can be seen as the cartesian product of <math>X</math> with the unit interval, modulo an equivalence relation to turn the interval into a loop.  The curried form then maps the space <math>X</math> to the space of functions from loops into <math>Z</math>, that is, from <math>X</math> into <math>\\Omega Z</math>.<ref name=rotman/> Then <math>\\text{curry}</math> is the [[adjoint functor]] that maps suspensions to loop spaces, and uncurrying is the dual.<ref name=rotman/>\n\nThe duality between the [[mapping cone (topology)|mapping cone]] and the mapping fiber ([[cofibration]] and [[fibration]])<ref name=may/>{{rp|at=chapters 6,7}} can be understood as a form of currying, which in turn leads to the duality of the [[long exact sequence|long exact]] and coexact [[Puppe sequence]]s.\n\nIn [[homological algebra]], the relationship between currying and uncurrying is known as [[tensor-hom adjunction]].  Here, an interesting twist arises: the [[Hom functor]] and the [[tensor product]] functor might not [[lift (mathematics)|lift]] to an [[exact sequence]]; this leads to the definition of the [[Ext functor]] and the [[Tor functor]].\n\n=== Domain theory ===\nIn [[order theory]], that is, the theory of [[lattice (order)|lattices]] of [[partially ordered set]]s, <math>\\text{curry}</math> is a [[continuous function]] when the lattice is given the [[Scott topology]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barendregt |first1=H.P. |authorlink1=Henk Barendregt |title=The Lambda Calculus |year=1984 |publisher=North-Holland |isbn=0-444-87508-5}} ''(See theorems 1.2.13, 1.2.14)''</ref> Scott-continuous functions were first investigated in the attempt to provide a semantics for [[lambda calculus]] (as ordinary set theory is inadequate to do this).  More generally, Scott-continuous functions are now studied in [[domain theory]], which encompasses the study of [[denotational semantics]] of computer algorithms. Note that the Scott topology is quite different than many common topologies one might encounter in the [[category of topological spaces]]; the Scott topology is typically [[final topology|finer]], and is not [[sober space|sober]].\n\nThe notion of continuity makes its appearance in [[homotopy type theory]], where, roughly speaking, two computer programs can be considered to be homotopic, i.e. compute the same results, if they can be \"continuously\" [[code refactoring|refactored]] from one to the other.\n\n=== Lambda calculi ===\nIn [[theoretical computer science]], currying provides a way to study functions with multiple arguments in very simple theoretical models, such as the [[lambda calculus]], in which functions only take a single argument. Consider a function <math>f(x,y)</math> taking two arguments, and having the type <math>(X \\times Y)\\to Z</math>, which should be understood to mean that ''x'' must have the type <math>X</math>, ''y'' must have the type <math>Y</math>, and the function itself returns the type <math>Z</math>. The curried form of ''f'' is defined as\n\n:<math>\\text{curry}(f) = \\lambda x.(\\lambda y.(f(x,y)))</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\lambda</math> is the abstractor of lambda calculus. Since curry takes, as input, functions with the type <math>(X\\times Y)\\to Z</math>, one concludes that the type of curry itself is\n\n:<math>\\text{curry}:((X \\times Y)\\to Z) \\to (X \\to (Y \\to Z))</math>\n\nThe \u2192 operator is often considered [[right-associative]], so the curried function type <math>X \\to (Y \\to Z)</math> is often written as <math>X \\to Y \\to Z</math>.  Conversely,  [[function application]] is considered to be [[Operator associativity|left-associative]], so that <math>f(x, y)</math> is equivalent to\n\n:<math>((\\text{curry}(f) \\; x) \\;y) = \\text{curry}(f) \\; x \\;y</math>.\n\nThat is, the parenthesis are not required to disambiguate the order of the application.\n\nCurried functions may be used in any [[programming language]] that supports [[closure (computer science)|closure]]s; however, uncurried functions are generally preferred for efficiency reasons, since the overhead of partial application and closure creation can then be avoided for most function calls.\n\n=== Type theory ===\nIn [[type theory]], the general idea of a [[type system]] in computer science is formalized into a specific algebra of types. For example, when writing <math>f \\colon X \\to Y </math>, the intent is that <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are [[type system|types]], while the arrow <math>\\to</math> is a [[type constructor]], specifically, the [[function type]] or arrow type.  Similarly, the Cartesian product <math>X \\times Y</math> of types is constructed by the [[product type]] constructor <math>\\times</math>.\n\nThe type-theoretical approach is expressed in programming languages such as [[ML (programming language)|ML]] and the languages derived from and inspired by it: [[CaML]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]].\n\nThe type-theoretical approach provides a natural complement to the language of [[category theory]], as discussed below. This is because categories, and specifically, [[monoidal categories]], have an [[internal language]], with [[simply-typed lambda calculus]] being the most prominent example of such a language.  It is important in this context, because it can be built from a single type constructor, the arrow type.  Currying then endows the language with a natural product type. The correspondence between objects in categories and types then allows programming languages to be re-interpreted as logics (via [[Curry\u2013Howard correspondence]]), and as other types of mathematical systems, as explored further, below.\n\n=== Logic ===\nUnder the [[Curry\u2013Howard correspondence]], the existence of currying and uncurrying is equivalent to the logical theorem <math>(A \\land B) \\to C \\Leftrightarrow A \\to (B \\to C)</math>, as [[tuple]]s ([[product type]]) corresponds to conjunction in logic, and function type corresponds to implication.\n\nThe [[exponential object]] <math>Q^P</math> in the category of [[Heyting algebra]]s is normally written as [[Material conditional|material implication]] <math>P\\to Q</math>. Distributive Heyting algebras are [[Boolean algebra]]s, and the exponential object has the explicit form <math>\\neg P \\lor Q</math>, thus making it clear that the exponential object really is [[Material implication (rule of inference)|material implication]].<ref>Saunders Mac Lane and Ieke Moerdijk, ''Sheaves in Geometry and Logic'' (1992) Springer {{ISBN|0-387-97710-4}} (''See Chapter 1, pp.48-57'')</ref>\n\n=== Category theory ===\nThe above notions of currying and uncurrying find their most general, abstract statement in [[category theory]]. Currying is a [[universal property]] of an [[exponential object]], and gives rise to an [[Adjunction (category theory)|adjunction]] in [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed categories]]. That is, there is a [[Natural transformation|natural]] [[isomorphism]] between the [[morphism (category theory)|morphisms]] from a [[product (category theory)|binary product]] <math>f \\colon (X \\times Y) \\to Z </math> and the morphisms to an exponential object <math>g \\colon X \\to Z^Y </math>.  \n\nThis generalizes to a broader result in [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal categories]]: Currying is the statement that the [[monoidal category|tensor product]] and the [[internal Hom]] are [[adjoint functors]]; that is, for every object <math>B</math> there is a [[natural transformation|natural isomorphism]]: \n\n:<math> \\mathrm{Hom}(A\\otimes B, C) \\cong \\mathrm{Hom}(A, B\\Rightarrow C) .</math>\n\nHere, ''Hom'' denotes the (external) Hom-functor of all morphisms in the category, while <math>B\\Rightarrow C</math> denotes the internal hom functor in the closed monoidal category.  For the [[category of sets]], the two are the same. When the product is the cartesian product, then the internal hom <math>B\\Rightarrow C</math> becomes the exponential object <math>C^B</math>.\n\nCurrying can break down in one of two ways. One is if a category is not [[closed category|closed]], and thus lacks an internal hom functor (possibly because there is more than one choice for such a functor). Another ways is if it is not [[monoidal category|monoidal]], and thus lacks a product (that is, lacks a way of writing down pairs of objects). Categories that do have both products and internal homs are exactly the closed monoidal categories.\n\nThe setting of cartesian closed categories is sufficient for the discussion of [[classical logic]]; the more general setting of closed monoidal categories is suitable for [[quantum computation]].<ref>Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke, \"[https://arxiv.org/abs/quantph/0402130/ A Categorical Semantics for Quantum Protocols].\"</ref>\n\nThe difference between these two is that the [[product (mathematics)|product]] for cartesian categories (such as the [[category of sets]], [[complete partial order]]s or [[Heyting algebra]]s) is just the [[Cartesian product]]; it is interpreted as an [[ordered pair]] of items (or a list).  [[Simply typed lambda calculus]] is the [[internal language]] of cartesian closed categories; and it is for this reason that pairs and lists are the primary [[type system|types]] in the [[type theory]] of [[LISP]], [[scheme (programming language)|scheme]] and many [[functional programming language]]s.\n\nBy contrast, the product for [[monoidal category|monoidal categories]] (such as [[Hilbert space]] and the [[vector space]]s of [[functional analysis]]) is the [[tensor product]]. The internal language of such categories is [[linear logic]], a form of [[quantum logic]]; the corresponding [[type system]] is the [[linear type system]]. Such categories are suitable for describing [[entangled quantum states]], and, more generally, allow a vast generalization of the [[Curry\u2013Howard correspondence]] to [[quantum mechanics]], to [[cobordism]]s in [[algebraic topology]], and to [[string theory]].<ref name=\"rosetta\">John C.

'''813''', Springer, Berlin, 2011, pp. 95-174.</ref>  The [[linear type system]], and [[linear logic]] are useful for describing [[synchronization primitive]]s, such as mutual exclusion locks, and the operation of vending machines.\n\n== Contrast with partial function application ==\n{{main article|Partial application}}\nCurrying and partial function application are often conflated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncarved.com/blog/not_currying.mrk|title=The Uncarved Blog: Partial Function Application is not Currying|work=uncarved.com}}</ref> (Reference is a blog). One of the significant differences between the two is that a call to a partially applied function returns the result right away, not another function down the currying chain; this distinction can be illustrated clearly for functions whose [[arity]] is greater than two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slid.es/gsklee/functional-programming-in-5-minutes|title=Functional Programming in 5 Minutes|work=Slides}}</ref>\n\nGiven a function of type <math>f \\colon (X \\times Y \\times Z) \\to N </math>, currying produces <math>\\text{curry}(f) \\colon X \\to (Y \\to (Z \\to N)) </math>.  That is, while an evaluation of the first function might be represented as <math>f(1, 2, 3)</math>, evaluation of the curried function would be represented as <math>f_\\text{curried}(1)(2)(3)</math>, applying each argument in turn to a single-argument function returned by the previous invocation.  Note that after calling <math>f_\\text{curried}(1)</math>, we are left with a function that takes a single argument and returns another function, not a function that takes two arguments.\n\nIn contrast, '''partial function application''' refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity.  Given the definition of <math>f</math> above, we might fix (or 'bind') the first argument, producing a function of type <math>\\text{partial}(f) \\colon (Y \\times Z) \\to N</math>.  Evaluation of this function might be represented as <math>f_\\text{partial}(2, 3)</math>.  Note that the result of partial function application in this case is a function that takes two arguments.\n\nIntuitively, partial function application says \"if you fix the first [[parameter (computer science)|argument]] of the function, you get a function of the remaining arguments\". For example, if function ''div'' stands for the division operation ''x''/''y'', then ''div'' with the parameter ''x'' fixed at 1 (i.e., ''div'' 1) is another function: the same as the function ''inv'' that returns the multiplicative inverse of its argument, defined by ''inv''(''y'') =&nbsp;1/''y''.\n\nThe practical motivation for partial application is that very often the functions obtained by supplying some but not all of the arguments to a function are useful; for example, many languages have a function or operator similar to <code>plus_one</code>. Partial application makes it easy to define these functions, for example by creating a function that represents the addition operator with 1 bound as its first argument.\n\nPartial application can be seen as evaluating a curried function at a fixed point, e.g. given <math>f \\colon (X \\times Y \\times Z) \\to N </math> and <math>a \\in X</math> then <math>\\text{curry}(\\text{partial}(f)_a)(y)(z) = \\text{curry}(f)(a)(y)(z) </math> or simply <math>\\text{partial}(f)_a = \\text{curry}_1(f)(a) </math> where <math>\\text{curry}_1</math> curries f's first parameter. \n\nThus, partial application is reduced to a curried function at a fixed point. Further, a curried function at a fixed point is (trivially), a partial application.  Thus, by reduction, a curried function at a fixed point is a partial application.  For further evidence, note that, given any function <math>f(x,y)</math>, a function <math>g(y,x)</math> may be defined such that <math>g(y,x) = f(x,y)</math>.  Thus, any partial application may be reduced to a single curry operation.  As such, curry is more suitably defined as an operation which, in many theoretical cases, is often applied recursively, but which is theoretically indistinguishable (when considered as an operation) from a partial application.\n\nSo, a partial application can be defined as the objective result of a single application of the curry operator on some ordering of the inputs of some function.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Tensor-hom adjunction]]\n* [[Lazy evaluation]]\n* [[Closure (computer science)]]\n* [[smn theorem|s<sub>mn</sub> theorem]]\n* [[Closed monoidal category]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal|last=Sch\u00f6nfinkel|first=Moses|title=\u00dcber die Bausteine der mathematischen Logik|journal=[[Math.

Most notably it refers to [[Cyrus the Great]]. Cyrus is also the name of [[Cyrus I of Anshan]] (ca. 650 BC), King of Persia the grandfather of Cyrus the Great; and [[Cyrus the Younger]] (died 401 BC), brother to the Persian King [[Artaxerxes II of Persia]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nCyrus, as a word in English, is the [[Latin]]ized form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:\u039a\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|\u039a\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2]], ''K\u0233ros'', from [[Old Persian]] {{lang|peo|[[wikt:\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfbd\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfc1|\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfbd\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfc1]]}} ''K\u016bru\u0161''.<ref name=cyrusthename>{{harv|Schmitt|1996a}}</ref> According to the inscriptions the name is reflected in [[Elamite]] ''Kura\u0161'', [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] ''Ku(r)-ra\u0161/-ra-\u00e1\u0161'' and [[Imperial Aramaic]] ''kwr\u0161''. The modern Persian form of the name is [[Koorosh (name)|Koorosh]].\n\nThe etymology of Cyrus has been and continues to be a topic of discussion amongst [[historians]], [[linguists]], and scholars of [[Iranology]]. The Old Persian name \"kuru\u0161\" has been interpreted in various forms from \"the Sun\", \"like Sun\", \"young\", \"hero\" to \"humiliator of the enemy in verbal contest\" and the Elamite \"kura\u0161\" has been translated as one \"who bestows care\".\n\nThe name has appeared on many monuments and inscriptions in Old Persian.<ref name=chicyrus>{{harv|Gershevitch|1985|pp=392\u20135}}</ref> There is also the record of a small inscription in Morghab (southwestern Iran) on which there is the sentence (''adam k\u016bru\u0161 x\u0161\u0101ya\u019fiya hax\u0101mani\u0161iya'') in [[Old Persian]] meaning (''I am Cyrus the [[Achaemenian#Achaemenid kings and leaders|Achaemenian]] King'').<ref name=murghabinscription>{{harv|Tolman|1908|p=55}}</ref> After a questionable<ref name=kurusname>{{harv|Tolam|1908|p=82}}</ref> proposal by the German linguist F. H. Weissbach that [[Darius the Great]] was the first to inscribe in [[Old Persian|Persian]], it had previously been concluded by some scholars that the inscription in Morghab refers to Cyrus the Younger. This proposal was the result of a false interpretation of a passage in paragraph 70 of [[Behistun inscription]] by Darius the Great.<ref>{{harv|Gershevitch|1985|p=395}}</ref> Based on many arguments,<ref>{{harv|Ghirshman|1965|p=246}}</ref> the accepted theory among modern scholars is that the inscription does belong to Cyrus the Great.<ref name=cyrustheyounger>{{harv|Schmitt|1996b}}</ref>\n\nThere are interpretations of name of Cyrus by classical authors identifying with or referring to the Persian word for \u201cSun\u201d.

That is, according to Tavernier, ''kura\u0161'' is an Elamite name and means \"to bestow care\".<ref name=Tavernier/> Others, such as Schmitt, Hoffmann maintain that the Persian ''Kuru\u0161'', which according to Skalmowsky, may be connected to (or a borrowing from) the [[Proto-Indo-European language|IE]] ''K\u00faru-'' from [[Old Indic]] can give an etymology of the Elamite ''kura\u0161''.<ref name=cyrusthename/><ref name=Tavernier/> In this regard  the Old Persian ''kuru\u0161'' is considered with the following etymologies: One proposal is discussed by the linguist [[Janos Harmatta]] that refers to the common Iranian root \"kur-\" (be born) of many words in Old, middle, and new [[Iranian languages]] (e.g. [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]). Accordingly, the name K\u016bru\u0161 means \"young, youth...\".<ref name=harmatta>{{harv|Harmatta|1971|pp=5\u20136}}</ref> Other Iranian etymologies have been proposed. The Indian proposal of Skalmowsky goes down to \"to do, accomplish\". Another theory is the suggestion of [[Karl Hoffmann (German historian)|Karl Hoffmann]] that ''kuru\u0161''  goes down to a ''-ru'' derivation from the IE root ''*(s)kau'' meaning \"to humiliate\"<ref name=Tavernier/>  and accordingly \"kuru\u0161\" (hence \"Cyrus\") means \"''humiliator'' (of the enemy in verbal contest)\".<ref name=cyrusthename/>\n\nPeople and fictional characters named Cyrus include:\n\n==People==\n===Given name===\n====Ancient world====\n*[[Cyrus I]] (ca. 650 BC), King of Anshan\n*[[Cyrus the Great]]  (ca. 600 BC or 576 BC\u2013530 BC) \u2013 also known as Cyrus II \u2013 the grandson of Cyrus I, an Achaemenid ruler and founder of the Great Persian Empire\n*[[Cyrus the Younger]] (died 401 BC), brother to the Persian King Artaxerxes\n*[[Cyrus (architect)]], 1st century Greek architect who worked in Rome\n*Saint Cyrus (see [[Cyrus and John]]), 4th century Coptic saint\n*[[Cyrus of Alexandria]], Melkite Patriarch and co-founder of Monothelism\n*[[Cyrus of Panopolis]], 5th-century Byzantine writer and official\n\n====Modern era====\n*[[Cyrus Leroy Baldridge]] (1889-1977), American artist, illustrator, author and adventurer\n*[[Cyrus Townsend Brady]] (1861-1920), American journalist, historian and adventure writer\n*[[Cyrus Broacha]] (born 1971), MTV India VJ\n*[[Cyrus Christie]] (born 1992), professional footballer who plays as right back for Middlesbrough F.C.\n*[[Cyrus Chothia]] (born 1942), British scientist\n*[[Cyrus Edwin Dallin]] (1861-1944), American sculptor\n*[[Cyrus S.

Also, the results of displaying such a model can be called a '''render'''. A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or [[data structure]]; it would contain geometry, viewpoint, [[texture mapping|texture]], [[lighting]], and [[shading]] information as a description of the virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a [[digital image]] or [[raster graphics]] image file. The term \"rendering\" may be by analogy with an \"artist's rendering\" of a scene.\n\nThough the technical details of rendering methods vary, the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a 3D representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the [[graphics pipeline]] along a rendering device, such as a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]. A GPU is a purpose-built device able to assist a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] in performing complex rendering calculations. If a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting, the rendering software should solve the [[rendering equation]]. The rendering equation doesn't account for all lighting phenomena, but is a general lighting model for computer-generated imagery. 'Rendering' is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing program to produce final video output.\n\nRendering is one of the major sub-topics of [[3D computer graphics]], and in practice is always connected to the others. In the [[graphics pipeline]], it is the last major step, giving the final appearance to the models and animation. With the increasing sophistication of computer graphics since the 1970s, it has become a more distinct subject.\n\nRendering has uses in [[Architectural rendering|architecture]], [[video game]]s, [[simulation|simulators]], [[film|movie]] or TV [[visual effects]], and design visualization, each employing a different balance of features and techniques. As a product, a wide variety of renderers are available. Some are integrated into larger modeling and animation packages, some are stand-alone, some are free open-source projects. On the inside, a renderer is a carefully engineered program, based on a selective mixture of disciplines related to: [[optics|light physics]], [[visual system|visual perception]], [[mathematics]], and [[software engineering|software development]].\n\nIn the case of 3D graphics, rendering may be done slowly, as in [[pre-rendered|pre-rendering]], or in realtime.  Pre-rendering is a computationally intensive process that is typically used for movie creation, while [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] rendering is often done for 3D video games which rely on the use of graphics cards with 3D [[hardware accelerators]].\n\n== Usage ==\nWhen the pre-image (a [[wireframe model|wireframe]] sketch usually) is complete, rendering is used, which adds in [[bitmap textures]] or [[procedural textures]], lights, [[bump mapping]] and relative position to other objects. The result is a completed image the consumer or intended viewer sees.\n\nFor movie animations, several images (frames) must be rendered, and stitched together in a program capable of making an animation of this sort. Most 3D image editing programs can do this.\n\n== Features ==\nA rendered image can be understood in terms of a number of visible features. Rendering [[research and development]] has been largely motivated by finding ways to simulate these efficiently. Some relate directly to particular algorithms and techniques, while others are produced together.\n\n* [[Shading]]{{snd}} how the color and brightness of a surface varies with lighting\n* [[Texture mapping|Texture-mapping]]{{snd}} a method of applying detail to surfaces\n* [[Bump mapping|Bump-mapping]]{{snd}} a method of simulating small-scale bumpiness on surfaces\n* [[Distance fog|Fogging/participating medium]]{{snd}} how light dims when passing through non-clear atmosphere or air\n* [[Shadow]]s{{snd}} the effect of obstructing light\n* [[Soft shadows]]{{snd}} varying darkness caused by partially obscured light sources\n* [[Reflection (computer graphics)|Reflection]]{{snd}} mirror-like or highly glossy reflection\n* [[Transparency (optics)]], [[transparency (graphic)]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]]{{snd}} sharp transmission of light through solid objects\n* [[Translucency]]{{snd}} highly scattered transmission of light through solid objects\n* [[Refraction]]{{snd}} bending of light associated with transparency\n* [[Diffraction]]{{snd}} bending, spreading, and interference of light passing by an object or aperture that disrupts the ray\n* [[Global illumination|Indirect illumination]]{{snd}} surfaces illuminated by light reflected off other surfaces, rather than directly from a light source (also known as global illumination)\n* [[Caustic (optics)|Caustics]] (a form of indirect illumination){{snd}} reflection of light off a shiny object, or focusing of light through a transparent object, to produce bright highlights on another object\n* [[Depth of field]]{{snd}} objects appear blurry or out of focus when too far in front of or behind the object in focus\n* [[Motion blur]]{{snd}} objects appear blurry due to high-speed motion, or the motion of the camera\n* [[Non-photorealistic rendering]]{{snd}} rendering of scenes in an artistic style, intended to look like a painting or drawing\n\n== Techniques ==\nMany rendering '''{{visible anchor|algorithms}}''' have been researched, and software used for rendering may employ a number of different techniques to obtain a final image.\n\n[[Vectorization (image tracing)|Tracing]] every [[photon|particle of light]] in a scene is nearly always completely impractical and would take a stupendous amount of time. Even tracing a portion large enough to produce an image takes an inordinate amount of time if the sampling is not intelligently restricted.\n\nTherefore, a few loose families of more-efficient light transport modelling techniques have emerged:\n* [[rasterization]], including [[scanline rendering]], geometrically projects objects in the scene to an image plane, without advanced optical effects;\n* [[ray casting]] considers the scene as observed from a specific point of view, calculating the observed image based only on geometry and very basic optical laws of reflection intensity, and perhaps using [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] techniques to reduce artifacts;\n* [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] is similar to ray casting, but employs more advanced optical simulation, and usually uses Monte Carlo techniques to obtain more realistic results at a speed that is often orders of magnitude faster.\nThe fourth type of light transport technique, [[Radiosity (computer graphics)|radiosity]] is not usually implemented as a rendering technique, but instead calculates the passage of light as it leaves the light source and illuminates surfaces. These surfaces are usually rendered to the display using one of the other three techniques.\n\nMost advanced software combines two or more of the techniques to obtain good-enough results at reasonable cost.\n\nAnother distinction is between [[Image and object order rendering|image order]] algorithms, which iterate over pixels of the image plane, and [[Image and object order rendering|object order]] algorithms, which iterate over objects in the scene. Generally object order is more efficient, as there are usually fewer objects in a scene than pixels.\n\n=== {{Anchor|Rasterisation}}Scanline rendering and rasterisation ===\n{{main|Rasterisation}}\n[[File:Latest Rendering of the E-ELT.jpg|thumb|Rendering of the [[European Extremely Large Telescope]].]]\n\nA high-level representation of an image necessarily contains elements in a different domain from pixels.  These elements are referred to as [[Primitives (computer graphics)|{{visible anchor|primitive}}s]].  In a schematic drawing, for instance, line segments and curves might be primitives.  In a graphical user interface, windows and buttons might be the primitives.  In rendering of 3D models, triangles and polygons in space might be primitives.\n\nIf a pixel-by-pixel (image order) approach to rendering is impractical or too slow for some task, then a primitive-by-primitive (object order) approach to rendering may prove useful.  Here, one loops through each of the primitives, determines which pixels in the image it affects, and modifies those pixels accordingly.  This is called '''rasterization''', and is the rendering method used by all current [[graphics card]]s.\n\nRasterization is frequently faster than pixel-by-pixel rendering.  First, large areas of the image may be empty of primitives; rasterization will ignore these areas, but pixel-by-pixel rendering must pass through them.  Second, rasterization can improve [[cache coherency]] and reduce redundant work by taking advantage of the fact that the pixels occupied by a single primitive tend to be contiguous in the image.  For these reasons, rasterization is usually the approach of choice when [[interactivity|interactive]] rendering is required; however, the pixel-by-pixel approach can often produce higher-quality images and is more versatile because it does not depend on as many assumptions about the image as rasterization.\n\nThe older form of rasterization is characterized by rendering an entire face (primitive) as a single color.  Alternatively, rasterization can be done in a more complicated manner by first rendering the vertices of a face and then rendering the pixels of that face as a blending of the vertex colors.  This version of rasterization has overtaken the old method as it allows the graphics to flow without complicated textures (a rasterized image when used face by face tends to have a very block-like effect if not covered in complex textures; the faces are not smooth because there is no gradual color change from one primitive to the next).  This newer method of rasterization utilizes the graphics card's more taxing shading functions and still achieves better performance because the simpler textures stored in memory use less space. Sometimes designers will use one rasterization method on some faces and the other method on others based on the angle at which that face meets other joined faces, thus increasing speed and not hurting the overall effect.\n\n=== Ray casting ===\n{{Main|Ray casting}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}\nIn '''ray casting''' the geometry which has been modeled is parsed pixel by pixel, line by line, from the point of view outward, as if casting rays out from the point of view. Where an object is intersected, the color value at the point may be evaluated using several methods. In the simplest, the color value of the object at the point of intersection becomes the value of that pixel. The color may be determined from a [[texture mapping|texture-map]]. A more sophisticated method is to modify the colour value by an illumination factor, but without calculating the relationship to a simulated light source. To reduce artifacts, a number of rays in slightly different directions may be averaged.\n\nRay casting involves calculating the \"view direction\" (from camera position), and incrementally following along that \"ray cast\" through \"solid 3d objects\" in the scene, while accumulating the resulting value from each point in 3D space.  This is related and similar to \"ray tracing\" except that the raycast is usually not \"bounced\" off surfaces (where the \"ray tracing\" indicates that it is tracing out the lights path including bounces). \"Ray casting\" implies that the light ray is following a straight path (which may include travelling through semi-transparent objects).  The ray cast is a vector that can originate from the camera or from the scene endpoint (\"back to front\", or \"front to back\").  Sometimes the final light value is a derived from a \"transfer function\" and sometimes it's used directly.\n\nRough simulations of optical properties may be additionally employed: a simple calculation of the ray from the object to the point of view is made. Another calculation is made of the angle of incidence of light rays from the light source(s), and from these as well as the specified intensities of the light sources, the value of the pixel is calculated. Another simulation uses illumination plotted from a radiosity algorithm, or a combination of these two.\n\n=== Ray tracing ===\n[[Image:SpiralSphereAndJuliaDetail1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Spiral Sphere and Julia, Detail'', a computer-generated image created by visual artist Robert W. McGregor using only [[POV-Ray]] 3.6 and its built-in scene description language.]]\n{{Main|Ray tracing (graphics)}}\n'''Ray tracing''' aims to simulate the natural flow of light, interpreted as particles. Often, ray tracing methods are utilized to approximate the solution to the [[rendering equation]] by applying [[Monte Carlo methods]] to it. Some of the most used methods are [[path tracing]], [[path tracing#Bidirectional path tracing|bidirectional path tracing]], or [[Metropolis light transport]], but also semi realistic methods are in use, like [[Whitted Style Ray Tracing]], or hybrids. While most implementations let light propagate on straight lines, applications exist to simulate relativistic spacetime effects.<ref>{{cite journal | citeseerx = 10.1.1.56.830 | title = Relativistic Ray-Tracing: Simulating the Visual Appearance of Rapidly Moving Objects }}</ref>\n\nIn a final, production quality rendering of a ray traced work, multiple rays are generally shot for each pixel, and traced not just to the first object of intersection, but rather, through a number of sequential 'bounces', using the known laws of optics such as \"angle of incidence equals angle of reflection\" and more advanced laws that deal with refraction and surface roughness.\n\nOnce the ray either encounters a light source, or more probably once a set limiting number of bounces has been evaluated, then the surface illumination at that final point is evaluated using techniques described above, and the changes along the way through the various bounces evaluated to estimate a value observed at the point of view. This is all repeated for each sample, for each pixel.\n\nIn [[distribution ray tracing]], at each point of intersection, multiple rays may be spawned. In [[path tracing]], however, only a single ray or none is fired at each intersection, utilizing the statistical nature of [[Monte Carlo methods|Monte Carlo]] experiments.\n\nAs a brute-force method, ray tracing has been too slow to consider for real-time, and until recently too slow even to consider for short films of any degree of quality, although it has been used for special effects sequences, and in advertising, where a short portion of high quality (perhaps even [[photorealism|photorealistic]]) footage is required.\n\nHowever, efforts at optimizing to reduce the number of calculations needed in portions of a work where detail is not high or does not depend on ray tracing features have led to a realistic possibility of wider use of ray tracing. There is now some hardware accelerated ray tracing equipment, at least in prototype phase, and some game demos which show use of real-time software or hardware ray tracing.\n\n== Radiosity ==\n{{Main|Radiosity (computer graphics)}}\n'''Radiosity''' is a method which attempts to simulate the way in which directly illuminated surfaces act as indirect light sources that illuminate other surfaces.  This produces more realistic shading and seems to better capture the '[[Shading#Ambient lighting|ambience]]' of an indoor scene. A classic example is the way that shadows 'hug' the corners of rooms.\n\nThe optical basis of the simulation is that some diffused light from a given point on a given surface is reflected in a large spectrum of directions and illuminates the area around it.\n\nThe simulation technique may vary in complexity. Many renderings have a very rough estimate of radiosity, simply illuminating an entire scene very slightly with a factor known as ambiance. However, when advanced radiosity estimation is coupled with a high quality ray tracing algorithm, images may exhibit convincing realism, particularly for indoor scenes.\n\nIn advanced radiosity simulation, recursive, finite-element algorithms 'bounce' light back and forth between surfaces in the model, until some recursion limit is reached. The colouring of one surface in this way influences the colouring of a neighbouring surface, and vice versa. The resulting values of illumination throughout the model (sometimes including for empty spaces) are stored and used as additional inputs when performing calculations in a ray-casting or ray-tracing model.\n\nDue to the iterative/recursive nature of the technique, complex objects are particularly slow to emulate. Prior to the standardization of rapid radiosity calculation, some [[digital artists]] used a technique referred to loosely as [[false radiosity]] by darkening areas of texture maps corresponding to corners, joints and recesses, and applying them via self-illumination or diffuse mapping for scanline rendering. Even now, advanced radiosity calculations may be reserved for calculating the ambiance of the room, from the light reflecting off walls, floor and ceiling, without examining the contribution that complex objects make to the radiosity\u2014or complex objects may be replaced in the radiosity calculation with simpler objects of similar size and texture.\n\nRadiosity calculations are viewpoint independent which increases the computations involved, but makes them useful for all viewpoints. If there is little rearrangement of radiosity objects in the scene, the same radiosity data may be reused for a number of frames, making radiosity an effective way to improve on the flatness of ray casting, without seriously impacting the overall rendering time-per-frame.\n\nBecause of this, radiosity is a prime component of leading real-time rendering methods, and has been used from beginning-to-end to create a large number of well-known recent feature-length animated 3D-cartoon films.\n\n== Sampling and filtering ==\nOne problem that any rendering system must deal with, no matter which approach it takes, is the '''sampling problem'''.  Essentially, the rendering process tries to depict a [[continuous function]] from image space to colors by using a finite number of pixels.  As a consequence of the [[Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem]] (or Kotelnikov theorem), any spatial waveform that can be displayed must consist of at least two pixels, which is proportional to [[image resolution]].  In simpler terms, this expresses the idea that an image cannot display details, peaks or troughs in color or intensity, that are smaller than one pixel.\n\nIf a naive rendering algorithm is used without any filtering, high frequencies in the image function will cause ugly [[aliasing]] to be present in the final image.  Aliasing typically manifests itself as [[jaggies]], or jagged edges on objects where the pixel grid is visible.  In order to remove aliasing, all rendering algorithms (if they are to produce good-looking images) must use some kind of [[low-pass filter]] on the image function to remove high frequencies, a process called [[Spatial anti-aliasing|antialiasing]].\n\n== Optimization ==\n\n\nDue to the large number of calculations, a work in progress is usually only rendered in detail appropriate to the portion of the work being developed at a given time, so in the initial stages of modeling, wireframe and ray casting may be used, even where the target output is ray tracing with radiosity. It is also common to render only parts of the scene at high detail, and to remove objects that are not important to what is currently being developed.\n\n\nFor real-time, it is appropriate to simplify one or more common approximations, and tune to the exact parameters of the scenery in question, which is also tuned to the agreed parameters to get the most 'bang for the buck'.\n\n== Academic core ==\n{{Main|Unbiased rendering}}\n\nThe implementation of a realistic renderer always has some basic element of physical simulation or emulation &mdash; some computation which resembles or abstracts a real physical process.\n\nThe term \"''physically based''\" indicates the use of physical models and approximations that are more general and widely accepted outside rendering. A particular set of related techniques have gradually become established in the rendering community.\n\nThe basic concepts are moderately straightforward, but intractable to calculate; and a single elegant algorithm or approach has been elusive for more general purpose renderers. In order to meet demands of robustness, accuracy and practicality, an implementation will be a complex combination of different techniques.\n\nRendering research is concerned with both the adaptation of scientific models and their efficient application.\n\n=== The rendering equation ===\n{{Main|Rendering equation}}\n\nThis is the key academic/theoretical concept in rendering. It serves as the most abstract formal expression of the non-perceptual aspect of rendering. All more complete algorithms can be seen as solutions to particular formulations of this equation.\n\n: <math>L_o(x, \\vec w) = L_e(x, \\vec w) + \\int_\\Omega f_r(x, \\vec w', \\vec w) L_i(x, \\vec w') (\\vec w' \\cdot \\vec n) \\mathrm{d}\\vec w'</math>\nMeaning: at a particular position and direction, the outgoing light (L<sub>o</sub>) is the sum of the emitted light (L<sub>e</sub>) and the reflected light. The reflected light being the sum of the incoming light (L<sub>i</sub>) from all directions, multiplied by the surface reflection and incoming angle. By connecting outward light to inward light, via an interaction point, this equation stands for the whole 'light transport' &mdash; all the movement of light \u2014 in a scene.\n\n=== The bidirectional reflectance distribution function ===\nThe '''[[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]]''' (BRDF) expresses a simple model of light interaction with a surface as follows:\n\n: <math>f_r(x, \\vec w', \\vec w) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}L_r(x, \\vec w)}{L_i(x, \\vec w')(\\vec w' \\cdot \\vec n) \\mathrm{d}\\vec w'}</math>\n\nLight interaction is often approximated by the even simpler models: diffuse reflection and specular reflection, although both can ALSO be BRDFs.\n\n=== Geometric optics ===\nRendering is practically exclusively concerned with the particle aspect of light physics &mdash; known as [[geometrical optics]]. Treating light, at its basic level, as particles bouncing around is a simplification, but appropriate: the wave aspects of light are negligible in most scenes, and are significantly more difficult to simulate. Notable wave aspect phenomena include diffraction (as seen in the colours of [[Compact disc|CDs]] and [[DVD]]s) and polarisation (as seen in [[Liquid-crystal display|LCDs]]). Both types of effect, if needed, are made by appearance-oriented adjustment of the reflection model.\n\n=== Visual perception ===\nThough it receives less attention, an understanding of [[human visual perception]] is valuable to rendering. This is mainly because image displays and human perception have restricted ranges. A renderer can simulate an almost infinite range of light brightness and color, but current displays &mdash; movie screen, computer monitor, etc. &mdash; cannot handle so much, and something must be discarded or compressed. Human perception also has limits, and so does not need to be given large-range images to create realism. This can help solve the problem of fitting images into displays, and, furthermore, suggest what short-cuts could be used in the rendering simulation, since certain subtleties won't be noticeable. This related subject is [[tone mapping]].\n\nMathematics used in rendering includes: [[linear algebra]], [[calculus]], [[numerical analysis|numerical mathematics]], [[digital signal processing|signal processing]], and [[Monte Carlo methods]].\n\nRendering for movies often takes place on a network of tightly connected computers known as a [[render farm]].\n\nThe current{{when|date=February 2014}} state of the art in 3-D image description for movie creation is the [[Mental Ray|mental ray]] [[scene description language]] designed at [[Mental Images|mental images]] and [[RenderMan Shading Language]] designed at [[Pixar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1185657.1185817|title=A brief introduction to RenderMan|first=Saty|last=Raghavachary|date=30 July 2006|publisher=ACM|pages=2|accessdate=7 May 2018|via=dl.acm.org|doi=10.1145/1185657.1185817}}</ref> (compare with simpler 3D fileformats such as [[VRML]] or [[application programming interface|APIs]] such as [[OpenGL]] and [[DirectX]] tailored for 3D hardware accelerators).\n\nOther renderers (including proprietary ones) can and are sometimes used, but most other renderers tend to miss one or more of the often needed features like good texture filtering, texture caching, programmable shaders, highend geometry types like hair, subdivision or nurbs surfaces with tesselation on demand, geometry caching, raytracing with geometry caching, high quality [[shadow mapping]], speed or patent-free implementations.  Other highly sought features these days may include [[interactive photorealistic rendering]]&nbsp;(IPR) and hardware rendering/shading.\n\nSome renderers execute on the [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] instead of the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] (eg. [[FurryBall]], Redshift, Octane). The parallelized nature of GPUs can be used for shorter render times. However, GPU renderers are constrained by the amount of video memory available.\n\n== Chronology of important published ideas ==\n[[File:ESTCube orbiidil 2.jpg|thumb|Rendering of an [[ESTCube-1]] satellite]]\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* 1968 ''[[Ray casting]]''<ref>{{cite conference | authorlink = Arthur Appel | last = Appel | first = A. | year = 1968 | url = http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/Appel.pdf | title = Some techniques for shading machine renderings of solids | booktitle = Proceedings of the Spring Joint Computer Conference | volume = 32 | pages = 37\u201349 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120313214110/http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/Appel.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-13 | df =  }}</ref>\n* 1970 ''[[Scanline rendering]]''<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = W.

Established by [[Greg Stafford]] in 1975, its first title was the board game ''[[White Bear and Red Moon]]'' (later renamed ''Dragon Pass''), set in Stafford's fictional fantasy gaming world of [[Glorantha]]. Over the years Chaosium has published many acclaimed and award-winning games. These include the roleplaying games ''[[RuneQuest]]'', set in Glorantha, and ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', based on the stories of [[H.P. Lovecraft]].\n\nWhile Stafford himself has been described as \"one of the most decorated game designers of all time\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1861515217/prince-valiant-storytelling-game-by-greg-stafford|title=Prince Valiant\u00ae Storytelling Game by Greg Stafford|author=|date=|work=kickstarter.com|accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref> and \"the grand shaman of gaming\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://juegosydados.wordpress.com/2016/07/19/interview-with-robin-d-laws/|title=Interview with Robin D.

Rusli|date=6 November 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1975-: Early years===\nGreg Stafford founded \"The Chaosium\" in 1975 to publish his board game ''[[White Bear and Red Moon]]''. He derived the name partly from his home, which was near the [[Oakland Coliseum]], combining \"coliseum\" with \"chaos.\"\n\nIn 1978 Chaosium published Steve Perrin's roleplaying game ''[[RuneQuest]]'', set in Stafford's mythic fantasy setting [[Glorantha]], following up with a second edition in 1980 and various supplements over the next six years.\n\n===1980s: Growth and licensing with Avalon Hill===\nIn 1980, the company officially incorporated as Chaosium Inc. That year, Stafford and Lynn Willis simplified the RuneQuest rules into the 16-page [[Basic Role-Playing]] (BRP). These [[GNS Theory#Simulationism|simulationist]], skill-based generic rules formed the basis of many of Chaosium's later [[Dice notation#Percentile dice|\"d100\"]] RPGs, most notably ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', first published in 1982, which has remained a significant hit through subsequent editions.\n\nChaosium entered into a licensing agreement with [[Avalon Hill]] in 1983 to produce a third edition of ''RuneQuest''. Avalon Hill manufactured and marketed the game, while Chaosium was responsible for acquisitions, design, development and layout. This relationship was not financially successful for Chaosium, although several high quality and well-received products were produced in a so-called \"RuneQuest Renaissance\" after Avalon Hill brought acclaimed game designer [[Ken Rolston]] on board to manage the line as \"Rune Czar\".\n\n===Late 1990s-: Financial struggle===\nIn 1996 it was prematurely reported that Chaosium had secured the rights to publish a collectible card game based on the video game [[Doom (series)|Doom]].<ref name=\"Duelist3\">{{Citation | last = Varney | first = Allen | title = Inside the Industry| pages = 84 | newspaper = The Duelist | date = February 1997 | issue =#15}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, following the financial failure of the collectable card game ''[[Mythos (card game)|Mythos]]'', Greg Stafford resigned as Chaosium president and left the company, along with Sandy Petersen (although they both remained shareholders). Chaosium effectively split up into various successor companies, each maintaining its focus on a few of the company's products. Stafford took the rights to his game setting Glorantha, setting up the company [[Issaries, Inc.]] to continue publishing this line (later licensing it to [[Moon Design Publications]], along with the game [[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]).\n\nLong-time employees and part-owners Charlie Krank and Lynn Willis remained at Chaosium as President and Editor-in-Chief respectively, continuing on with ''Call of Cthulhu'' as the main product line. Lynn Willis retired in 2008 due to poor health and died in 2013.\n\n===Recent years===\nProblems and delays fulfilling the [[Kickstarter]]s for the 7th edition of ''Call of Cthulhu'' led Stafford and Petersen to return to an active role at Chaosium in June 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/448333182/call-of-cthulhu-7th-edition/posts/1251694|title=Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition|website=Kickstarter|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> Charlie Krank subsequently left the company.\n\nLater that year at [[Gen Con]] 2015, Stafford and Petersen announced Moon Design Publications were now part of the Chaosium ownership, and the four principals of Moon Design ([[Rick Meints]], [[Jeff Richard]], [[Michael O'Brien (game designer)|Michael O'Brien]] and [[Neil Robinson (game designer)|Neil Robinson]]) had become the new Chaosium management team. Chaosium once again became the licensed publisher for ''RuneQuest'', ''HeroQuest'' and other products related to Gloranthan universe, and continue to publish the ''Call of Cthulhu'' line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chaosium.com/blog/greg-stafford-announces-new-ownership-group-for-chaosium-at-gen-con|title=Greg Stafford Announces New Ownership Group For Chaosium At Gen Con|author=Michael O'Brien|date=30 July 2015|work=Chaosium Blog|accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref> Stafford and Petersen remained as board members (Stafford as chair), and creative consultants to the company.\n\nAs part of its financial reorganization, the new management closed the company office and warehouse in [[Hayward, California]], ending Chaosium's long association with the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yog-sothoth.com/articles.html/_/main/chaosium-leaves-california|title=Chaosium Leaves California|date=23 September 2015|work=Yog-Sothoth}}</ref> The company is now based in [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]] and uses a [[fulfillment house]] model for distribution of product.\n\nDelivery of the core rewards of the Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition Kickstarter finally commenced in April 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cthulhu Company Kickstarted itself to Death, Then This Happened|url=http://geekandsundry.com/cthulhu-company-kickstarted-itself-to-death-then-this-happened|author=Ben Riggs|work=Geek and Sundry|date=29 April 2016}}</ref> The new edition went on to win nine of the ten awards it was nominated for at the [[Gen Con]] 2017 [[ENnies|ENnie Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2017 Noms and Winners|url=http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/2017-noms-and-winners|website=ENnie Awards}}</ref>\n\n==Fiction==\nChaosium began publishing a line of non-game books (primarily fiction) in 1993.

Their rivalry with the Chicago Cardinals, the oldest in the NFL (and a crosstown rival from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out of the first six league titles. During the league's first six years, the Bears lost twice to the [[Canton Bulldogs]] (who took two league titles over that span), and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4\u20134\u20132 against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated the Bears more than a single time. During that span, the Bears posted 34 shutouts.\n\nThe Bears' rivalry with the [[Green Bay Packers]] is one of the oldest and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921 (the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent their signing a particular player, and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Brian |title=Love-Hate Relationship: Bears-Packers Rivalry Always Bittersweet |url=http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ |publisher=Green Bay Packers |date=September 28, 2000 |accessdate=June 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107015852/http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ |archivedate=7 January 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1924bears.jpg|left|thumb|The 1924 team photo]]The franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing the NFL Championship in {{nfly|1921}} and remaining competitive throughout the decade.

They faced the problem of increased operating costs and flatlined attendance. The Bears would only draw roughly 5,000\u20136,000 fans a game, while a University of Chicago game would draw 40,000\u201350,000 fans a game. By adding top college football draw Red Grange to the roster, the Bears knew that they found something to draw more fans to their games. C.C. Pyle was able to secure a $2,000 per game contract for Grange, and in one of the first games, the Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers, 21\u20130. However, Grange remained on the sidelines while learning the team's plays from Bears quarterback [[Joey Sternaman]]. Later in 1925, The Bears would go on a barnstorming tour, showing off the best football player of the day. 75,000 people paid to see Grange lead the Bears to a 17\u20137 victory over the Los Angeles Tigers, who were a quickly put together team of West Coast college all-stars.

The Bears also lost star quarterback [[Joey Sternaman]], who joined the Chicago Bulls of the AFL. The Bears replaced Grange with Paddy Driscoll, a star football player in his own right. The Bears used the money made from the Grange barn-storming tour to sign the man that replaced him. Grange split his time between making movies and playing football. However, the time was not right to have two competing pro football leagues, and the AFL folded after only one season. Grange would return to the Bears.<ref name=\"ChicagoBears\" />\n\nAfter the financial losses of the {{nfly|1932}} Championship season, Halas' partner Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on for forty seasons, an NFL record. In the [[NFL Playoff Game, 1932|1932 \"Unofficial\" NFL Championship]], the Bears defeated the [[Portsmouth Spartans]] in the first indoor American football game at [[Chicago Stadium]].\n\nThe success of the playoff game led the NFL to institute a championship game.

The movie was later released for theater screenings after first being shown on television. Despite Hall of Fame careers, Butkus and Sayers would also have their careers cut short due to injuries, hamstringing the Bears of this era.\n\nHalas retired as coach in [[1967 Chicago Bears season|1967]] and spent the rest of his days in the front office. He became the only person to be involved with the NFL throughout the first 60 years of its existence. He was also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's first induction class in 1963. As the only living founder of the NFL at the February 1970 [[AFL-NFL Merger|merger]] between the NFL and the [[American Football League]], the owners honored Halas by electing him the first President of the [[National Football Conference]], a position that he held until his death in 1983.

His gritty personality earned him the nickname \"Iron Mike\". The team reached the NFC Championship game in 1984. In the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985]] season the fire in the Bears\u2013Packers rivalry was re-lit when Ditka used 315 pound defensive tackle [[William Perry (football)|\"Refrigerator\" Perry]] as a running back in a [[touchdown]] play at [[Lambeau Field]], against the Packers. The Bears won their ninth NFL Championship, first since the [[AFL-NFL merger]], in Super Bowl XX after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their then-revolutionary [[46 defense]] and a cast of characters that recorded the novelty rap song \"[[The Super Bowl Shuffle]]\". The season was notable in that the Bears had only one loss, the \"unlucky 13th\" game of the season, a [[Monday Night Football|Monday night]] affair in which they were defeated by the [[Miami Dolphins]]. At the time, much was made of the fact that the {{nfly|1972}} [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] were the only franchise in history to have had an [[perfect season|undefeated season and post-season]].

While both head coaches led the team to the playoffs once (Wannstedt in 1994 and Jauron in 2001), neither was able to accumulate a winning record or bring the Bears back to the Super Bowl.

The Bengals compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC North|North]] division. Their home stadium is [[Paul Brown Stadium]] in [[downtown Cincinnati]]. Their head coach is [[Marvin Lewis]], who has held the position since 2003 and is currently the second-longest tenured head coach in the NFL, behind the [[New England Patriots]]' [[Bill Belichick]]. Their divisional opponents are the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Cleveland Browns]], and the [[Baltimore Ravens]].\n\nThe Bengals were founded in {{nfly|1966}} as a member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL) by former Cleveland Browns head coach [[Paul Brown]]. Brown was the Bengals' head coach from their inception to {{nfly|1975}}. After being dismissed as the Browns' head coach by [[Art Modell]] (who had purchased majority interest in the team in {{nfly|1961}}) in January {{nfly|1963}}, Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city, [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]], and [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Cincinnati Reds]] (who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete [[Crosley Field]]) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build [[Riverfront Stadium|a multipurpose stadium]] which could host both baseball and football games.\n\nDue to the [[AFL&ndash;NFL merger|impending merger]] of the AFL and the NFL, which was scheduled to take full effect in the {{nfly|1970}} season, Brown agreed to join the AFL as its tenth and final franchise. The Bengals, like the other former AFL teams, were assigned to the AFC following the merger. Cincinnati was also selected because, like their neighbors the Reds, they could draw from several large neighboring cities ([[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and [[Lexington, Kentucky]]; [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], and [[Springfield, Ohio]]) that are all no more than {{convert|110|mi}} away from downtown Cincinnati.\n\nThe Bengals won the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC championship]] in {{nfly|1981}} and {{nfly|1988}}, but lost [[Super Bowl]]s [[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]] and [[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]] to the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. After Paul Brown's death in 1991, controlling interest in the team was inherited by his son, [[Mike Brown (Cincinnati Bengals owner)|Mike Brown]]. In 2011, Brown purchased shares of the team owned by the estate of co-founder [[Austin Knowlton]] and is now the majority owner of the Bengals franchise.<ref>{{cite news|last=Katzowitz|first=Josh|title=Mike Brown Now Owns Most of Bengals Franchise|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22475988/34008660|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|website=CBSSports.com|date=December 23, 2011|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe 1990s and the 2000s were a period of great struggle.

It also was a nod to Paul Brown's Massillon, Ohio, roots where he coached the high school team known as the Tigers.\n\nIn [[1967 AFL season|1967]], an ownership group led by Paul Brown was granted a franchise in the [[American Football League]]. Brown named the team the Bengals in order \"to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Team Chronology|url=http://prod.static.bengals.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/2017/17-history.pdf#page=2|publisher=Cincinnati Bengals|date=June 26, 2017|accessdate=May 7, 2018}}</ref> Another Bengals team had existed in the city and played in three previous American Football Leagues<ref>[[American Football League (1936)|AFL II]] 1937, [[American Football League (1938)|AFL/APFA]] 1939, [[American Football League (1940)|AFL III]] 1940\u20131941</ref> from [[1937 American Football League season|1937]] to [[1942 in sports|1942]]. The city's world-renowned [[Cincinnati Zoo|zoo]] was also home to a rare white [[Bengal tiger]]. However, possibly as an insult to [[Art Modell]], or possibly as a homage to his own start as a head coach to the [[Massillon Washington High School|Massillon Tigers]], Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word \"BENGALS\" in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in [[1981 in sports|1981]] and which is still in use to this day; however, that design featured yellow stripes on a turquoise helmet{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} which were more uniform in width.\n\nIn 1966, the American Football League agreed to [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|a merger]] with its older and more established rival, the [[National Football League]]. Among the terms of the merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise. One of the reasons the NFL agreed to this was that they wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added that brought the combined total number clubs in the merged league to twenty-six teams. The NFL was content for that team to be in the American Football League because it meant that the existing nine AFL clubs were the ones that had to provide players in the ensuing [[expansion draft]] and the NFL owners preferred for the ensuing dilution of talent to occur in what they had always considered to be an inferior league.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million\u2013400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement.\n\nPrior to the merger being announced, Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League, and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that \"I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conigliofamily.com/PaulBrown.htm|title=Paul Brown|publisher=Conigliofamily.com|accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref> However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short to medium term. He ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL when after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970.\n\nThere was also a complication: [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Cincinnati Reds]] were in need of a facility to replace the antiquated, obsolete [[Crosley Field]], which they had used since [[1912 Major League Baseball season|1912]]. Parking nightmares had plagued the city as far back as the 1950s, the little park lacked modern amenities, and New York City, which in [[1957 Major League Baseball season|1957]] had lost both its [[National League]] teams (the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] and the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]]) to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, was actively courting Reds owner [[Powel Crosley]]. However, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated worsening problems with the Crosley Field location, which were exacerbated by the [[Millcreek Expressway]] ([[I-75]]) project that ran alongside the park.\n[[File:Cincinnati-paul-brown-stadium2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Paul Brown Stadium]], home of the Bengals.]]\nWith assistance from Ohio governor James A. Rhodes, [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city. The new facility had to be ready by the opening of the [[1970 NFL season]] and was officially named [[Riverfront Stadium]]. With the completion of the merger in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], the Cleveland Browns were moved to the AFL-based American Football Conference and placed in the [[AFC Central]], the same division as the Bengals. An instant [[Battle of Ohio (NFL)|rivalry was born]], fueled initially by Paul Brown's rivalry with Art Modell.\n\nFor their first two seasons, the Bengals played at [[Nippert Stadium]] which is the current home of the [[University of Cincinnati]] [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Bearcats]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a6JQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u1wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4236,1676508&dq=nippert+stadium+cincinnati+bengals&hl=en|title=Hot Football Time in Old Cincy Tonight|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|agency=Associated Press|date=August 3, 1968|page=2C|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref> The team held training camp at [[Wilmington College (Ohio)|Wilmington College]] in [[Wilmington, Ohio]], through the 1968 preseason.

One of Brown's college draft strategies was to draft players with above-average intelligence. Punter/wide receiver [[Pat McInally]] attended [[Harvard University]] and linebacker Reggie Williams attended [[Dartmouth College]] and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players were highly articulate and went on to have successful careers in [[Play-by-play|commentary]] and [[broadcasting]] as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Verderame|first1=Matt|title=Paul Brown and his Lasting Influence on the NFL|url=http://fansided.com/2016/09/06/paul-brown-nfl-browns-bengals-innovations/|website=Fansided|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=22 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium, a home they shared with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] until the team moved to [[Paul Brown Stadium]] in [[2000 NFL season|2000]].

The team appeared in the playoffs in [[1990 NFL season|1990]], making it to the second round  before losing to the Los Angeles Raiders. Before the [[1991 NFL Season|following season]] got underway, Paul Brown died at age 82. He had already transferred control to his son, [[Mike Brown (football team owner)|Mike Brown]], but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team.  The Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse as the team posted 14 consecutive non-winning seasons and were saddled with numerous draft busts. They began to emerge from that dismal period into a new era of increased consistency, however, after the hiring of [[Marvin Lewis]] as head coach in 2003. [[Carson Palmer]], the future star quarterback, was drafted in [[2003 NFL Draft|2003]], but did not play a snap that whole season, as [[Jon Kitna]] had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year). Despite Kitna's success, Palmer was promoted to starting quarterback the [[2004 NFL season|following season]]. Under Palmer, the team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1990 in the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], which also was the first time the team had a winning percentage above .500 since 1990.\n\nThe Bengals returned to the playoffs again in [[2009 NFL season|2009]] in a season that included the franchise's first ever division sweep. This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals (the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens) had both made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/sports/football/17lewis.html|title=Bengals\u2019 Lewis Is N.F.L.

When the Bengals refused to do so, Palmer announced his retirement from the NFL.  He later was moved at the NFL trade deadline to the [[Oakland Raiders]].  In the [[2011 NFL draft]], the Bengals selected wide receiver [[A. J. Green|AJ Green]] in the first round, and quarterback [[Andy Dalton]] in the second round.  The Bengals improved to 9\u20137 in the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]], and clinched a playoff spot. Dalton and Green became the most prolific rookie WR-QB duo in history, connecting 65 times for 1,057 yards.  However, they lost to the [[Houston Texans]] 31\u201310 in the Wild Card Round. In the [[2012 NFL season|2012 season]], the Bengals clinched a playoff spot once more with a win over the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], going to the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time since 1982. However, the Bengals faced the Texans in the first round yet again and took another early exit, losing 19\u201313.\n\nIn the [[2013 NFL season|2013 season]], for the third straight year, the Bengals clinched a playoff berth and also won the AFC North, finishing with an 11\u20135 record. But once again, the Bengals were defeated in the wild card round, this time by the [[San Diego Chargers]], 27\u201310. Most of the blame was put on Andy Dalton, who threw 2 interceptions and fumbled on a forward dive. This made the Bengals 0\u20135 in playoff games since Mike Brown took over as owner. The [[2014 NFL season|2014 season]] started well with the Bengals winning their first three contests against the Baltimore Ravens, the Atlanta Falcons, and the Tennessee Titans. However, they lost their week 5 matchup at the New England Patriots, 43\u201317. An overtime tie to the [[Carolina Panthers]] and shutout loss to the [[Indianapolis Colts]] followed the primetime loss to the Patriots. Finishing the season 10\u20135\u20131 as the 5th seed, they lost to the Colts, 26\u201310, in the first round of the playoffs. This was the first time the franchise made the playoffs four straight seasons.\n\nIn 2015, the Bengals got out to a franchise-best 8\u20130 start with a 31\u201310 win over the [[Cleveland Browns]], But then they the lost multiple games in a row losing their undefeated title but still winning their division and clinching a playoff berth.  However, they lost to the division rival [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], 18\u201316, in the Wild Card round in the final minute, making them the first franchise in NFL history to lose five straight opening round playoff games. This frustration continued in 2016 for the Bengals. The Bengals finished the 2016 campaign with a 6\u20139\u20131 record, losing several key players to injury including AJ Green, [[Giovani Bernard]], and [[Jeremy Hill]]. They missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010, marking the first time Andy Dalton missed the playoffs as the Bengals' starting quarterback. One notable game was a 27\u201327 tie against the [[Washington Redskins]] which was played in [[London]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://pro32.ap.org/article/redskins-bengals-battle-27-27-tie-london|title=Redskins, Bengals battle to 27-27 tie in London|date=October 30, 2016|work=Pro32: Head to Head|access-date=March 15, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a rough 2016 season, the Bengals looked forward into 2017.

When Paul Brown was fired by [[Art Modell]], Brown still owned the equipment used by Cleveland. So after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment, which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were brown, orange, and white, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest.\n\nThe Bengals' team colors were orange, black, and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word \"Bengals\" in black block letters (with a white outline) on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL as they did not have secondary uniform numbers on the jerseys (called ''TV numbers'') until the 1980 season, when they appeared on the sleeves; they were the only NFL team that did not have them prior to that point. That same year, the team changed their helmet facemask color from gray to black. The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced. Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced the orange helmets with black tiger stripes that are still in use today.\n\nIn 1997, the Bengals designed a logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves (with this, the ''TV numbers'' moved to the shoulder). Another alternate logo consisted of a Bengal's head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the trademark. In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange tiger-striped sleeves and white side panels, while the white jerseys began to use black tiger-striped sleeves and orange shoulders.<ref>{{cite web|title=2004-Present: The New Stripes|url=http://www.bengals.com/team/history/uniforms-2004.html|publisher=Cincinnati Bengals|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> A new logo consisting of an orange \"B\" covered with black tiger stripes was introduced.<ref name=\"BengalsLogoHistory\" /> The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey, with white side panels and black tiger-striped sleeves. The Bengals have worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, with some exceptions such as the 1970 season when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season, and most of the 1971 season. Since 2005, the Bengals wear white for September home games where the heat could become a factor.\n\n==Mascots==\nThe team's official mascot is a [[Bengal tiger]] named Who Dey.<ref name=\"WhoDey\" /> Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the [[Cincinnati Ben\u2013Gals]], the team's [[NFL Cheerleading|cheerleading squad]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bengals.com/cheerleaders/index.html|title=Ben-Gals Cheerleaders Home|publisher=Bengals.com|accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref> which included [[Laura Vikmanis]], the oldest cheerleader in league history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1349473/Laura-Vikmanis-42-NFLs-oldest-cheerleader-Can-younger-girls.html|title=Laura Vikmanis, 42, is NFL's oldest cheerleader: Can she keep up with younger girls?|publisher=Dailymail.co.uk|date=2011-01-22|accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref>\n\n==Contributions to NFL culture==\n\n===No-huddle offense===\nA [[no-huddle offense]] was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However, [[Sam Wyche]], the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator [[Bruce Coslet]], made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly substituting and setting up for the next play\u2014often within 5\u201310 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds\u2014the Bengals hindered the other team's defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactical purpose, and resting. In response the NFL instituted rules allowing the defense ample time for substitutions when offensive substitutions were made.\n\nThe hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy during this time was the [[Buffalo Bills]], coached by [[Marv Levy]], who also used a version of the no-huddle offense starting with the 1989 season.  The Bengals had beaten the Bills three times in 1988 (pre-season, regular season, and the AFC Championship Game). Marv Levy threatened to fake injuries if the Bengals used the \"no-huddle\" in the AFC Championship. Wyche was notified that the commissioner had ordered the \"no-huddle\" illegal for the game.  The official notified Wyche and the Bengals' team just two hours before the game kickoff.  Wyche asked to talk directly to the commissioner and word immediately came back that the \"no-huddle\" would not be penalized.  Levy did not have his players fake injuries in the game, but installed his version the next year, 1989.  The Bengals first used the \"no-huddle\" in 1984.  Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules.  Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time.  This allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers time to repair an equipment defect.\n\n===West Coast offense===\nThe [[West Coast offense]] is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. Walsh formulated what has become popularly known as the West Coast offense during his tenure as assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975, while working under the tutelage of Brown (and before embarking on his legendary coaching tenure with the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s). Bengals quarterback [[Virgil Carter]] was the first player to successfully implement Walsh's system, leading the NFL in pass completion percentage in 1971. [[Ken Anderson (quarterback)|Ken Anderson]] later replaced Carter as Cincinnati's starting quarterback, and was even more successful. In his 16-year career in the NFL, Anderson made four trips to the Pro Bowl, won four passing titles, was named NFL MVP in 1981, and set the record for completion percentage in a single season in 1982 with 70.66%.\n\n===Zone blitz===\nThe defense created to combat the West Coast offense also came from Cincinnati. Then-Bengals [[defensive coordinator]] [[Dick LeBeau]] (who later served as the team's head coach from 2000\u20132002) created the [[zone blitz]] in the 1980s in response to the West Coast offense.\n\n==Season-by-season records==\n{{main article|List of Cincinnati Bengals seasons}}\n\n==Players of note==\n{{Category see also|Cincinnati Bengals players}}\n\n===Current roster===\n{{Cincinnati Bengals roster}}\n\n===Retired numbers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=5 style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"| '''Cincinnati Bengals retired numbers'''\n|-\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|No.\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|Player\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|Position\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|Seasons\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|Retired\n|-\n| '''54''' || [[Bob Johnson (American football)|Bob Johnson]] || [[Center (American football)|C]] || 1968\u201379 || 1978\n|}\n\n===Pro Football Hall of Fame members===\nThree members of the Hall of Fame have spent some portion of their career with the Bengals, only one spent their entire career with the Bengals.

The entire chant is: \"Who dey, who dey, who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?\" The answer screamed in unison, \"Nobody.\" Sometimes fans will instead shout \"Who Dey?\" to represent the entire cheer. \"Who Dey\" is also the name of the team's [[mascot]], a [[Bengal tiger]].<ref name=\"WhoDey\" />\n\nThe Who Dey chant's first known to be used by the New Orleans Saints, in the form of Who Dat. It was later adopted by fans of the [[1980 Cincinnati Bengals season|1980 Cincinnati Bengals]]. While the origin of the chant is unsettled, one possible source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: \"Who's going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!\" Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/who-dey-vs-who-dat/ | title=Who Dey vs. Who Dat | publisher=[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]] | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 14, 2006 | accessdate=June 15, 2011 | author=Monkovic, Toni}}</ref>\n\nThe Who Dey chant is also steeped in local beer lore. Hudy, a leading product of [[Hudepohl Brewing Company]] through the late 1980s, bears a phonetic similarity to the \"Who Dey\" chant. Beer vendors who carried full cases of bottled local beer up and down the steep upper stairs of what was then Riverfront Stadium would call out \"Hudy\", \"Berger\" and other local beer names. Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out. During the 1980 season the banter with the Hudepohl vendors grew organically into the now famous (Hu-Dey) -Who They?- chant.<ref>This is an eye witness account from a Cincinnati Bengals season ticket holder.  This family held season tickets for the Bengals from their inaugural season in 1968 through the 2000 season when the Bengals moved to Paul Brown Stadium.</ref>\n\nThe chant bears some similarities to the phrase \"[[Who Dat?]]\", which was officially adopted by the [[New Orleans Saints]] in 1983 but had been used by Louisiana's high school team fans for some time. The saying \"Who Dat?\" originated in [[minstrel shows]] and vaudeville acts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then it was taken up by [[Dixieland|New Orleans Jazz]] and various Big band folks in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s, local [[Louisiana]] High Schools, [[St. Augustine High School (New Orleans)|St. Augustine High School]] and [[Patterson High School (Louisiana)|Patterson High School]] reportedly have been using the cheer and Gulf Coast fans of [[Alcorn State University]] and [[Louisiana State University]] picked up the cheer in the 1970s. Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana claims to have originated the cheer in the late 1960s in their version: \"Who dat talking 'bout beating dem Jags?\"<ref>{{cite web

In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above {{convert|5000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} to less than {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The headwaters of the Yangtze are situated at an elevation of about {{convert|4900|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}.

Between Chongqing and Yichang (I-ch'ang), at an altitude of {{convert|40|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} and a distance of about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|sp=us}}, it passes through the spectacular [[Yangtze Gorges]], which are noted for their natural beauty but are dangerous to shipping.\n\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at [[Yibin]]. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through [[Mount Wushan]] bordering [[Chongqing]] and [[Hubei]] to create the famous [[Three Gorges]]. Eastward of the Three Gorges, [[Yichang]] is the first city on the [[Yangtze Plain]].\n\nAfter entering Hubei, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is [[Dongting Lake]], which is located on the border of [[Hunan]] and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At [[Wuhan]], it receives its biggest tributary, the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], bringing water from its northern basin as far as [[Shaanxi]].\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi, [[Lake Poyang]], the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]] provinces, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the [[East China Sea]] at [[Shanghai]].\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River.

This is the largest comprehensive [[irrigation]] project in the world and has a significant impact on [[Agriculture in China|China's agriculture]]. Its proponents argue that it will free people living along the river from floods that have repeatedly threatened them in the past and will offer them [[electricity]] and [[water transport]]\u2014though at the expense of permanently flooding many existing towns (including numerous ancient cultural relics) and causing large-scale changes in the local [[ecology]].\n\nOpponents of the dam point out that there are three different kinds of floods on the Yangtze River: floods which originate in the upper reaches, floods which originate in the lower reaches, and floods along the entire length of the river. They argue that the Three Gorges dam will actually make flooding in the upper reaches worse and have little or no impact on floods which originate in the lower reaches. Twelve hundred years of low water marks on the river were recorded in the inscriptions and the carvings of carp at [[Baiheliang]], now submerged.\n\nThe Yangtze is flanked with metallurgical, power, chemical, auto, building materials and machinery industrial belts and high-tech development zones. It is playing an increasingly crucial role in the river valley's economic growth and has become a vital link for international shipping to the inland provinces. The river is a major transportation artery for China, connecting the interior with the coast.\n\nThe river is one of the world's busiest waterways. Traffic includes commercial traffic transporting bulk goods such as coal as well as manufactured goods and passengers. Cargo transportation reached 795 million tons in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-01/23/content_4089542.htm|title=Xinhua - English|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-02/04/content_4133140.htm|title=Xinhua - English|publisher=}}</ref> River cruises several days long, especially through the beautiful and scenic [[Three Gorges]] area, are becoming popular as the tourism industry grows in China.\n\nFlooding along the river has been a major problem. The [[rainy season]] in China is May and June in areas south of Yangtze River, and July and August in areas north of it. The huge river system receives water from both southern and northern flanks, which causes its flood season to extend from May to August. Meanwhile, the relatively dense population and rich cities along the river make the floods more deadly and costly. The most recent major floods were the [[1998 Yangtze River Floods]], but more disastrous were the [[1954 Yangtze River Floods]], which killed around 30,000 people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Yangtze-River-floods|title=Yangtze River floods|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|The Sand Pebbles (novel)|The Sand Pebbles (film)|USS Asheville (PG-21)|Yangtze Patrol}}\n\n=== Geologic history ===\nAlthough the mouth of the [[Yellow River]] has fluctuated widely north and south of the [[Shandong peninsula]] within the historical record, the Yangtze has remained largely static.

Adopting [[Chinese characters]], political institutions, and military technology, they were among the most powerful [[Ancient Chinese states|states]] during the later [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]]. In the middle Yangtze, the [[state of Jing]] seems to have begun in the upper Han River valley a minor Zhou polity, but it adapted to native culture as it expanded south and east into the Yangtze valley. In the process, it changed its name to [[state of Chu|Chu]].<ref>Lothar von Falkenhausen, Chinese Society in the Age of Confucius (1000\u2013250 BC): The Archaeological Evidence (Los Angeles: Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, 2006), 262\u201388; Constance A.

They fell in against themselves, however. Chu's growing power led its rival [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu's capital [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]] in 506&nbsp;BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu's southern flank. In 473&nbsp;BC, [[King Goujian of Yue]] fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its [[Wu (city)|eponymous capital]] at modern Suzhou. In 333&nbsp;BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the [[Minyue]] kingdom in [[Fujian]]. [[state of Qin|Qin]] was able to unite China by first subduing [[state of Ba|Ba]] and [[state of Shu|Shu]] on the upper Yangtze in modern [[Sichuan]], giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river.\n\nThe state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region, previous heartland of Chu, in 278 BC, and incorporated the region into its expanding empire. Qin then used its connections along the Yangtze River the [[Xiang River]] to expand China into [[Hunan]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Guangdong]], setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the [[collapse of the Qin Dynasty]], these southern commanderies became the independent [[Nanyue Empire]] under [[Zhao Tuo]] while Chu and Han [[Chu-Han Contention|vied with each other]] for control of the north.\n\nFrom the [[Han Dynasty]], the region of the Yangtze River became more and more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is [[Dujiangyan Irrigation System|Dujiangyan]], northwest of Chengdu, built during the [[Warring States]] period) made agriculture very stable and productive. The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands, maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods.<ref>Brian Lander, \"State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region.\" T\u2019oung Pao 100.4-5 (2014): 325\u2013362.</ref> By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river. Early in the Qing dynasty, the region called [[Jiangnan]] (that includes the southern part of [[Jiangsu]], the northern part of [[Zhejiang]], and the southeastern part of [[Anhui]]) provided \u2153\u2013\u00bd of the nation's revenues.\n\nThe Yangtze has long been the backbone of China's inland water transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the [[Jiangnan]] region south of the river ([[Wuxi]], [[Suzhou]], [[Hangzhou]]) and with northern China (all the way from [[Yangzhou]] to [[Beijing]]). The less well known ancient [[Lingqu Canal]], connecting the upper [[Xiang River]] with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the [[Pearl River Delta]].<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5339/ Lingqu Canal (Xiang'an County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Qin Dynasty)] (Nomination for the UNESCO Heritage List)</ref>\n\nHistorically, the Yangtze became the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see [[History of China]]) because of the difficulty of crossing the river. This occurred notably during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], and the [[Southern Song]]. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in 208 AD during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.\n\nThe Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the [[Song dynasty]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] during the [[Jin\u2013Song wars]]. In the [[Battle of Caishi]] of 1161, the ships of the Jin emperor [[Wanyan Liang]] clashed with the [[Naval history of China|Song fleet]] on the Yangtze. Song soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulphur using trebuchets at the Jurchen warships. The battle was a Song victory that halted the invasion by the Jin.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jing-shen|last=Tao|chapter=A Tyrant on the Yangtze: The Battle of T'sai-shih in 1161|title=Excursions in Chinese Culture|year=2002|publisher=Chinese University Press|isbn=978-962-201-915-7|pages=149\u2013155}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Needham|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Military technology: The Gunpowder Epic, Volume 5, Part 7|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-30358-3|page=166}}</ref> The [[Battle of Tangdao]] was another Yangtze naval battle from the same year.\n\nPolitically, [[Nanjing]] was the capital of China several times, although most of the time its territory only covered the southeastern part of China, such as the [[Eastern Wu|Wu kingdom]] in the Three Kingdoms period, the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]], and during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] and [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] periods. Only the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] occupied most parts of China from their capital at [[Nanjing]], though it later moved the capital to [[Beijing]]. The [[Republic of China|ROC]] capital was located in [[Nanjing]] in the periods 1911\u201312, 1927\u201337, and 1945\u201349.\n\n{{wide image|Anonymous-Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River.jpg|5000px|''Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River'', a [[Ming Dynasty]] landscape painting.}}\n\n=== Age of steam ===\n{{Main|Steamboats on the Yangtze River|China Station}}\n\nThe first merchant steamer in China, the ''Jardine'', was built to order for the firm of [[Jardine Matheson Holdings|Jardine Matheson]] in 1835. She was a small vessel intended for use as a mail and passenger carrier between [[Lintin Island]], [[Macao]] and [[Whampoa Dock|Whampoa]]. However, after several trips, the Chinese authorities, for reasons best known to themselves, prohibited her entrance into the river. [[Lord Palmerston]], the British Foreign Secretary who personified [[gunboat diplomacy]], decided to wage war on China mainly on the \"suggestions\" of Jardine Matheson{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannon fire aimed at a British ship, the ''Royal Saxon'', the British started the [[First Opium War]]. The Imperial Government, forced to surrender, gave in to the demands of the British. British military was vastly superior during the conflict. British warships, constructed using such innovations as steam power combined with sail and the use of iron in shipbuilding, wreaked havoc on coastal towns; such ships (like the ''[[Nemesis (1839)|Nemesis]]'') were not only virtually indestructible using contemporary available weapons, but also highly mobile and able to support a gun platform with very heavy guns. In addition, the British troops were armed with modern rifled muskets and cannons, unlike the Qing forces. After the British took [[Guangzhou|Canton]], they sailed up the Yangtze and took the tax barges, a devastating blow to the Empire as it slashed the revenue of the imperial court in Beijing to just a small fraction of what it had been.\n\nIn 1842, the Qing authorities sued for peace, which concluded with the [[Treaty of Nanjing]] signed on a gunboat in the river, negotiated in August of that year and ratified in 1843. In the treaty, China was forced to pay an indemnity to Britain, open five ports to Britain, and cede [[Hong Kong]] to [[Queen Victoria]]. In the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, the Qing empire also recognized Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects extraterritorial privileges in treaty ports.\n[[File:1937 Yangtze Gorges VP8.webm|thumb|left|Yangtze River steam boats filmed in 1937]]\n\n=== U.S. and French conflicts ===\nThe US, at the same time, wanting to protect its interests and expand trade, ventured the ''[[USS Wachusett (1861)|USS Wachusett]]'' six-hundred miles up the river to [[Hankou District|Hankow]] sometime in the 1860s, while the ''[[USS Ashuelot (1865)|USS Ashuelot]]'', a sidewheeler, made her way up the river to [[Yichang]] in 1874. The first ''[[USS Monocacy (1864)|USS Monocacy]]'', a sidewheel gunboat, began charting the Yangtze River in 1871. The first ''[[USS Palos (1865)|USS Palos]]'', an armed tug, was on [[Asiatic Squadron|Asiatic Station]] into 1891, cruising the Chinese and Japanese coasts, visiting the open treaty ports and making occasional voyages up the Yangtze River. From June to September 1891, anti-foreign riots up the Yangtze forced the warship to make an extended voyage as far as [[Hankow]], 600 miles upriver. Stopping at each open treaty port, the gunboat cooperated with naval vessels of other nations and repairing damage. She then operated along the north and central China coast and on the lower Yangtze until June 1892. The cessation of bloodshed with the [[Taiping Rebellion]], [[Europeans]] put more steamers on the river. The [[France|French]] engaged the Chinese in war over the rule of [[Vietnam]]. The [[Sino-French War]]s of the 1880s emerged with the [[Battle of Shipu]] having French cruisers in the lower Yangtze.\n[[File:USSLuzonPG-7.jpg|left|thumb|[[USS Luzon (PG-47)|USS ''Luzon'']]]]\n[[The China Navigation Company]] was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in [[London]], initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after and in 1883 a regular service to [[Australia]] was initiated. Most of the company's ships were seized by [[Japan]] in 1941 and services did not resume until 1946. [[Robert Dollar]] was a later shipping magnate, who became enormously influential moving Californian and Canadian lumber to the Chinese and Japanese market.\n\n[[Yichang]], or Ichang, {{convert|1600|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} from the sea, is the head of navigation for river steamers; oceangoing vessels may navigate the river to [[Hankow]], a distance of almost {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} from the sea. For about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} inland from its mouth, the river is virtually at sea level.\n\nThe Chinese Government, too, had steamers. It had its own naval fleet, the [[Nanyang Fleet]], which fell prey to the French fleet. The Chinese would rebuild its fleet, only to be ravaged by another war with [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan (1895)]], [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution (1911)]] and ongoing inefficiency and corruption. Chinese companies ran their own steamers, but were second tier to European operations at the time.\n\n===Navigation on the upper river===\n[[File:Yangtze kiang 1915.jpg|thumb|Yangtze in 1915]]\n[[File:Cruise boats on yangtze.jpg|thumb|Cruise boats on Yangtze]]\n[[File:A vehicle carrier on yangtze.jpg|thumb|A vehicle carrier on Yangtze]]\n[[File:A container carrier on yangtze.jpg|thumb|A container carrier on Yangtze]]\n\nSteamers came late to the upper river, the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But  summer was better navigationally and the [[three gorges]], described as an \"150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass\", posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 \u2013 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70 - 80 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges.<ref>Lyman P. Van Slyke, ''Yangtze, Nature, History and the River'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc., Massachusetts, 1988, p.18-19 and 121-123.</ref> Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the [[Chefoo Convention]] opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built ''Kuling'' but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes.  ''Kuling'' was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service.  In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native crafts.  In 1895, the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade.  Little took up residence in Chongqing and built ''Leechuan'', to tackle the gorges in 1898.  In March ''Leechuan'' completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers.  ''Leechuan'' was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot.<ref>''Ibid.'', p. 170-172.</ref>  In 1898, Little persuaded Captain [[Samuel Cornell Plant]] to come out to China to lend his expertise.  Captain Plant had just completed navigation of [[Iran|Persia]]'s Upper [[Karun River]] and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on ''Leechuan'' at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had ''SS Pioneer'' built with Plant in command.  In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing.  ''Pioneer'' was sold to [[British Royal Navy]] after its first run due to threat from the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and renamed ''HMS Kinsha''.  Germany's steamship effort that same year on ''SS Suixing'' ended in catastrophe.  On ''Suixing's'' maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze.  In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing.  Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, ''SS Shutung'' and ''SS Shuhun''. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too.  Plant was appointed by [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service]] as First Senior River Inspector in 1915.  In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems.  He also wrote ''Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River'', a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction.  Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze.  Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, [[Jardine Matheson]], [[Butterfield and Swire]] and [[Standard Oil]] added their own steamers on the river between 1917 - 1919.  Between 1918 -1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shih Brandmeyer | first1 = Polly | year = 2014 | title = Cornell Plant, Lost Girls and Recovered Lives - Sino-British Relations at the Human Level in Late Qing and Early Republican China | url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=875703566361829;res=IELHSS | journal = Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 106\u2013110 }}</ref> ''Shutung'' was commandeered by warlords and ''Shuhun'' was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping.<ref>\"Returns of Trade and Trade Reports 1918,\" ''China - The Maritime Customs'', published by Order of the Inspector General of Customs.</ref> In 1921, when Captain Plant died tragically at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation.

In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners.  One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English.  Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.<ref>Peter Simpson, \"Hell and High Water,\" ''South China Morning Post Magazine'', October 2, 2011, p.24-30.</ref><ref>Plant Memorial Brochure, 20th March 1923, ''National Maritime Museum'', Greenwich, Archive Collection, \"Papers of Capt.

In that year, however, these were merged into the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company Ltd, a public company under the management of Jardine's. The Jardine company pushed inland up the Yangtsze River on which a specially designed fleet was built to meet all requirements of the river trade. For many years, this fleet gave unequalled service. Jardine's established an enviable reputation for the efficient handling of shipping. As a result, the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] invited the firm to attend to the Agency of their Shire Line which operated in the [[Far East]]. Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were all destroyed on December 12, 1937 when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.<ref>Mender, P., Thirty Years A Mariner in the Far East 1907-1937, The Memoirs of Peter Mender, A Standard Oil Ship Captain on China's Yangtze River, p.53, {{ISBN|978-1-60910-498-6}}</ref>\n\n===Navy ships===\n[[File:Japanese cruiser Izumo in Shanghai.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] [[armored cruiser]] ''[[Japanese cruiser Izumo|Izumo]]'' at Shanghai in 1937. She sank [[riverboat]]s on the Yangtze in 1941.]]\n{{see also|Yangtze Incident}}\nWith the [[Treaty Ports]], the [[Great power|European powers]] and Japan were allowed to sail navy ships into China's waters. The British, Americans, and French did this. A full international fleet featured on Chinese waters: [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[German Empire|German]] navy ships came to Shanghai and the treaty ports. The Japanese engaged in open warfare with the Chinese over conquest of the Chinese [[Qing Empire]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894-1895, and with Russia over Qing Empire territory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905. Incidentally, both the [[French Navy|French]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] navies were heavily involved in running [[opium]] and [[narcotics]] to Shanghai, where it was refined into [[morphine]]. It was then transhipped by liner back to [[Marseille]] and [[France]] (i.e. [[French Connection]]) for processing in [[German Empire|Germany]] and eventual sale in the U.S. or [[Europe]].\n\nIn 1909 the gunboat {{USS|Samar|PG-41|6}} changed station to Shanghai, where she regularly patrolled the lower Yangtze River up to [[Nanking]] and Wuhu. Following an anti-foreign riots in [[Changsha]] in April 1910, which destroyed a number of missions and merchant warehouses, Samar sailed up the Yangtze River to [[Hankow]] and then Changsa to show the flag and help restore order. The gunboat was also administratively assigned to the [[Asiatic Fleet]] that year, which had been reestablished by the Navy to better protect, in the words of the Bureau of Navigation, \"American interests in the Orient.\" After returning to Shanghai in August, she sailed up river again the following summer, passing Wuhu in June but then running aground off Kichau on July 1, 1911.\n\nAfter staying stuck in the mud for two weeks, Samar broke free and sailed back down river to coal ship. Returning upriver, the gunboat reached Hankow in August and [[Ichang]] in September where she wintered over owing to both the dry season and the outbreak of rebellion at [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] in October 1911. Tensions eased and the gunboat turned downriver in July 1912, arriving at Shanghai in October. Samar patrolled the lower Yangtze after fighting broke out in the summer 1913, a precursor to a decade of conflict between provincial [[warlord]]s in China. In 1919, she was placed on the disposal list at Shanghai following a collision with a Yangtze River steamer that damaged her bow.\n\nThe [[Spain|Spanish]] boats were replaced in the 1920s by {{USS|Luzon|PG-47|6}} and {{USS|Mindanao|PR-8|6}} were the largest, {{USS|Oahu|PR-6|6}} and {{USS|Panay|PR-5|6}} next in size, and {{USS|Guam|PG-43|6}} and {{USS|Tutuila|PG-44|6}} the smallest. China in the first fifty years of the 20th century, was in low-grade chaos. Warlords, revolutions, natural disasters, civil war and invasions contributed. Yangtze boats were involved in the [[Nanking incident of 1927]] when the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] and [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalists]] broke into open war. The [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|massacre of the Communists]] in Shanghai in 1927 furthered the unrest, [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] with tanks were landed. River steamers were popular targets for both Nationalists and Communists, and peasants who would take periodic pot-shots at vessels. During the course of service the second {{USS|Palos|PG-16|6}} protected American interests in China down the entire length of the Yangtze, at times convoying U.S. and foreign vessels on the river, evacuating American citizens during periods of disturbance and in general giving credible presence to U.S. consulates and residences in various Chinese cities. In the period of great unrest in central China in the 1920s, Palos was especially busy patrolling the upper Yangtze against bands of warlord soldiers and outlaws. The warship engaged in continuous patrol operations between Ichang and [[Chongqing|Chungking]] throughout 1923, supplying armed guards to merchant ships, and protecting Americans at Chungking while that city was under siege by a warlord army.\n\nThe British [[Royal Navy]] had a series of [[Insect-class gunboat]]s which patrolled between Chungking and [[Shanghai]]. Cruisers and destroyers and [[Fly-class gunboat]]s{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} also patrolled. The most infamous incident was when ''Panay'' and {{HMS|Bee|1915|6}} in 1937, were dive-bombed by Japanese aeroplanes during the notorious [[Nanking Massacre]]. The Westerners were forced to leave the Yangtze River with the Japanese takeover in 1941. The former steamers were either sabotaged or pressed into Japanese or Chinese service. Probably the most curious incident involved {{HMS|Amethyst|F116|6}} in 1949 during the [[Chinese Civil War]] between [[Kuomintang]] and [[People's Liberation Army]] forces; and led to the award of the [[Dickin Medal]] to the ship's cat [[Simon (cat)|Simon]].\n\n==Hydrology==\n\n===Periodic floods===\n\nTens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes. The floods large enough to overflow the dikes have caused great distress to those who live and farm there.\nFloods of note include 1931, 1935, 1954, 1998.\n\n{{see also|1931 China floods}}\n\nThe 1931 Central China floods or the Central China floods of 1931 were a series of floods that occurred in the Republic of China. The floods are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted). Estimates of the total death toll range from 145,000 to between 3.7 million and 4 million.\n\nThe Yangtze again flooded in 1935, causing great loss of life.\n\n{{see also|1954 Yangtze River Floods}}\n\nFrom June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at around 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\n{{See also|1998 Yangtze River floods}}\n\nThe 1998 Yangtze River floods ({{lang|zh-hans|1998\u5e74\u4e2d\u56fd\u6d2a\u6c34}}) was a major flood that lasted from middle of June to the beginning of September 1998 in the [[People's Republic of China]] at the [[Yangtze River]].<ref name=\"cnews\">Chinanews.com.cn. \"[https://archive.is/20130101151742/http://big5.chinanews.com.cn:89/special/guoqing/60/2009/06-25/127.shtml Chinanews.com.cn].\" {{lang|zh|98\u5e74\u7279\u5927\u6d2a\u6c34}}.

More than a hundred lakes were thus cut off from the main river.<ref name=\"WWF UK\"/> There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ma|first=Jun|title=China's Water Crisis|publisher=An International Rivers Network Book|pages=55\u201356|year=2004}}</ref> Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, [[Baidang Lake]] shrunk from {{convert|100|km2|sp=us}} in the 1950s to {{convert|40|km2|sp=us}} in 2005. [[Zhangdu Lake]] dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as [[Poyang Lake]] and [[Dongting Lake]], remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of [[carp]] who thrived in [[Eutrophication|eutrophic]] water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage.<ref name=\"WWF UK\" /><ref name=\"Lakes reunited\">{{cite web |last = [[China Daily]] |title=Isolated Yangtze lakes reunited with mother river |url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200507/12/eng20050712_195638.html |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |date = July 12, 2005}}</ref> In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution.<ref name=\"Yangtze River Turns Red and Turns Up a Mystery\">{{cite web |last = [[ABC News]] |title = Yangtze River Turns Red and Turns Up a Mystery |url = http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/yangtze-river-turns-red-and-turns-up-a-mystery/ |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |date=September 7, 2012}}</ref> The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable \"iron barrier\" that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the [[Baiji Dolphin]], [[narrow-ridged finless porpoise]] and the [[Yangtze Alligator]]. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.<ref>Ellen Wohl.

The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were [[Zhangdu Lake]], [[Honghu Lake]], and [[Tian'e-Zhou]] in [[Hubei]] province on the middle Yangtze. In 2005 Baidang Lake in [[Anhui]] Province was also reconnected.<ref name=\"Lakes reunited\" />\n\nReconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea.<ref>{{cite web |last=WWF China |title=The Yangtze Forum |url=http://www.wwfchina.org/english/downloads/Yangtze%20Forum.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425091933/http://www.wwfchina.org/english/downloads/Yangtze%20Forum.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 }}</ref> In 2006 China\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes.

For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry.  On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the ''[[Zhong\u2019anlun Monument|Zhong\u2019anlun]]'' disaster (October 15, 1945).\n\nThe river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China.  In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] and [[Pukou]], and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from [[Wuchang Railway Station|Wuchang]] or [[Nanjing West Railway Station|Nanjing West]].\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], a dual-use [[list of road-rail bridges|road-rail bridge]], built from 1955 to 1957.  It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River.  The second bridge across the river was built a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959.  The [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in [[Nanjing]].  It was built after the [[Sino-Soviet Split]] and did not receive foreign assistance.  Road-rail bridges were then built in [[Zhicheng]] (1971) and Chongqing (1980).\n\nBridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century.  The [[Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge]] was built in 1992 as part of the [[Jingjiu railway|Beijing-Jiujiang Railway]].  A [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|second bridge in Wuhan]] was completed in 1995.  By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai.  These include some of the longest [[suspension bridge|suspension]] and [[cable-stayed bridge]]s in the world on the Yangtze Delta: [[Jiangyin Suspension Bridge]] (1,385 m, opened in 1999), [[Runyang Bridge]] (1,490 m, opened 2005), [[Sutong Bridge]] (1,088 m, opened 2008).

The player controls the protagonist and his companions in the game's [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[fictional universe|fictional world]], consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an [[overworld]] map, depicting the landscape from a scaled-down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled-down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure [[item (gaming)|items]] and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. ''Chrono Trigger''{{'}}s gameplay deviates from that of traditional Japanese RPGs in that, rather than appearing in [[random encounter]]s, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.<ref name=\"npreview2\">{{Cite journal |date=July 1995 |volume=74 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Epic Center: Chrono Trigger |pages=&nbsp;53}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ChronoTriggerInside.PNG|thumb|left|Unlike most other role-playing games at the time, combat in ''Chrono Trigger'' occurs in the same area where general navigation occurs, with all enemies visible on screen.|alt=A wooded area rendered in the Super NES' graphics, two gray status bars (one at the top, one at the bottom of the screen), three \"Blue Imp\" enemies surrounding the character Crono in the middle of the area, Crono slashing at the topmost imp which has a surprised expression on its face]]\n\nPlayers and enemies may use physical or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves.  Each character and enemy has a certain number of [[hit point]]s; successful attacks reduce that character's hit points, which can be restored with potions and spells. When a playable character loses all hit points, they faint; if all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously [[saved game|saved]] chapter, except in specific storyline-related battles that allow or force the player to lose. Between battles, the player can equip his/her characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power or defense against magic), and various consumable items can be used both in and out of battles.  Items and equipment can be purchased in shops or found on field maps, often in [[treasure chest (video games)|treasure chests]]. By exploring new areas and fighting enemies, players progress through ''Chrono Trigger''{{'}}s story.\n\n''Chrono Trigger'' uses an [[Conditional Turn-Based Battle|Active Time Battle]] system\u2014a staple of Square's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game series designed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]] for ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''\u2014named \"Active Time Battle 2.0.\"<ref name=\"Battle 2.0\">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co. | publisher =Square Soft | date=August 22, 1995 | platform =Super NES | quote='''Menu screen:''' Active Time Battle 2.0}}</ref> Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer dependent on the character's speed [[Attribute (role-playing games)|statistic]] counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques are handled through a system called \"Techs.\" Techs deplete a character's [[magic point]]s (a numerical meter similar to hit points), and often have special areas of effect; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques exist.<ref name=\"npreview2\" /> Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others' to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono's sword-spinning ''Cyclone'' Tech can be combined with Lucca's ''Flame Toss'' to create ''Flame Whirl''. When characters with compatible Techs have enough magic points available to perform their techniques, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.\n\n''Chrono Trigger'' features several other distinct gameplay traits, including time travel. Players have access to seven eras of the game world's history, and past actions affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete side quests, and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called \"time gates\", as well as a [[time travel|time machine]] named ''Epoch''. The game contains thirteen unique endings; the ending the player receives depends on when and how they reach and complete the game's final battle.<ref name=\"nppreview\">{{Cite journal| volume=73 |date=June 1995 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Chrono Trigger: A New Standard for RPGs | pages=&nbsp;37}}</ref> ''Chrono Trigger DS'' features a new ending that can be accessed from the End of Time upon completion of the final extra dungeon and optional final boss.<ref name=\"dsultimania\">{{cite book|year=2009 |editor=Studio BentStuff |title=Chrono Trigger Ultimania |page=581 |language=Japanese |publisher=Square Enix |url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Supporting_Material_Translation.html#Chrono_Trigger_Ultimania |isbn=978-4-7575-2469-9 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119231921/http://chronocompendium.com/Term/Supporting_Material_Translation.html |archivedate=November 19, 2010 }}</ref> ''Chrono Trigger'' also introduces a [[New Game Plus]] option; after completing the game, the player may begin a new game with the same character [[Experience point|levels]], [[Statistic (role-playing games)|techniques]], and equipment, excluding money, with which they ended the previous playthrough. However, certain items central to the storyline are removed and must be found again, such as the sword Masamune. Square has since employed the New Game Plus concept in later titles, including ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', ''[[Parasite Eve (video game)|Parasite Eve]]'', ''[[Vagrant Story]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', and ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Setting===\n''Chrono Trigger'' takes place in a world similar to Earth, with eras such as the prehistoric age, in which primitive [[human]]s and dinosaurs share the earth; the [[Middle Ages]], replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future, where destitute humans and sentient robots struggle to survive. The characters frequently [[time travel|travel through time]] to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year [[Infinity|\u221e]]), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the ''Wings of Time,'' nicknamed the ''Epoch.'' The vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period without first having to travel to the End of Time.\n\n===Characters===\n{{main|Characters of Chrono Trigger}}\n''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s six playable characters (plus one optional character) come from different eras of history. ''Chrono Trigger'' begins in AD 1000 with [[Crono (Chrono Trigger)|Crono]], [[Marle (Chrono Trigger)|Marle]] and [[Lucca Ashtear|Lucca]]. Crono is the silent protagonist, characterized as a fearless young man who wields a [[katana]] in battle. Marle (Princess Nadia) lives in Guardia Castle; though sheltered, at heart she's a princess who enjoys hiding her royal identity. Lucca is a friend of Crono's and a mechanical genius; her home is filled with laboratory equipment and machinery. From the era of AD 2300 comes [[Robo (Chrono Trigger)|Robo]], or Prometheus (designation R-66Y), a robot with near-human personality created to assist humans. Lying dormant in the future, Robo is found and repaired by Lucca, and joins the group out of gratitude.<ref name=\"characters\">{{cite book | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles instruction manual | pages=&nbsp;32\u201333 | publisher=Square Enix  | id=SLUS-01363}}</ref> The fiercely confident [[Ayla (Chrono Trigger)|Ayla]] dwells in 65,000,000 BC. Unmatched in raw strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village and leads her people in war against a species of humanoid [[reptile]]s known as Reptites.\n\nThe last two playable characters are [[Glenn (Chrono Trigger)|Frog]] and [[Magil|Magus]]. Frog originated in AD 600. He is a former [[squire]] once named Glenn, who was turned into an [[Kemono|anthropomorphic]] frog by Magus, who also killed his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus. Meanwhile, Guardia in AD 600 is in a state of conflict against the Mystics (known as Fiends in the US/DS port), a race of demons and intelligent animals who wage war against humanity under the leadership of Magus, a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]]. Magus's seclusion conceals a long-lost past; he was formerly known as Janus, the young prince of the Kingdom of Zeal, which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 BC. The incident sent him forward through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods over the fate of his sister, [[Schala]].<ref name=\"characters\" /> Lavos, the game's main antagonist who awakens and ravages the world in AD 1999, is an extraterrestrial, parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the Earth's energy for its own growth.\n\n===Story===\nIn AD 1000, Crono and Marle watch Lucca and her father demonstrate her new [[Teleportation|teleporter]] at the Millennial Fair. When Marle volunteers to be teleported, her pendant interferes with the device and creates a time portal into which she is drawn.<ref name=\"portal\">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=August 22, 1995 |platform =Super NES |level=Leene Square |quote='''Taban:''' What's going on Lucca?

Lucca realizes that this time period's kingdom has mistaken Marle for an ancestor of hers who had been kidnapped, thus putting off the recovery effort for her ancestor and creating a [[grandfather paradox]]. Crono and Lucca, with the help of Frog, restore history to normal by recovering the kidnapped queen. After the three part ways with Frog and return to the present, Crono is arrested on charges of kidnapping the princess and sentenced to death by the current chancellor of Guardia. Lucca and Marle help Crono to flee, haphazardly using another time portal to escape their pursuers. This portal lands them in AD 2300, where they learn that an advanced civilization has been wiped out by a giant creature known as Lavos that appeared in 1999.<ref name=\"dayoflavos\">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=August 22, 1995 | platform =Super NES |level=Arris Dome |quote='''Marle:''' Say, what does this button do? / '''Lucca:''' 1999 A.D.?

Entering a gate created by the newly-landed Lavos, they go to BC 12,000, an ice age, where the party finds the Kingdom of Zeal, who recently discovered Lavos and seeks to drain its power to achieve immortality through the Mammon Machine. Zeal's leader, Queen Zeal, imprisons Crono and friends on orders of the Prophet, a mysterious figure who has recently begun advising the queen. Though Zeal's daughter Schala frees them, the Prophet forces her to banish them from the realm and seal the time gate they used to travel to the Dark Ages. They return next to AD 2300 to find a time machine called the Wings of Time (or ''Epoch''), which can access any time period without using a time gate. They travel back to BC 12000 to stop Zeal from activating the Mammon Machine in the Ocean Palace.

When Lavos appeared after his battle with Crono and his allies, he was cast back to the time of Zeal and presented himself to them as a prophet. At this point, Magus is either killed by the party, killed in a duel with Frog, or spared and convinced to join the party. As Crono's friends depart, the ruined Ocean Palace rises into the air as the Black Omen.

The methods of compactification are various, but each is a way of controlling points from \"going off to infinity\" by in some way adding \"points at infinity\" or preventing such an \"escape\".\n\n==An example==\n\nConsider the [[real line]] with its ordinary topology. This space is not compact; in a sense, points can go off to infinity to the left or to the right. It is possible to turn the real line into a compact space by adding a single \"point at infinity\" which we will denote by \u221e. The resulting compactification can be thought of as a circle (which is compact as a closed and bounded subset of the Euclidean plane). Every sequence that ran off to infinity in the real line will then converge to \u221e in this compactification.\n\nIntuitively, the process can be pictured as follows: first shrink the real line to the [[open interval]] (-[[pi|\u03c0]],\u03c0) on the ''x''-axis; then bend the ends of this interval upwards (in positive ''y''-direction) and move them towards each other, until you get a circle with one point (the topmost one) missing. This point is our new point \u221e \"at infinity\"; adding it in completes the compact circle.\n\nA bit more formally: we represent a point on the [[unit circle]] by its [[angle]], in [[radian]]s, going from -\u03c0 to \u03c0 for simplicity.  Identify each such point \u03b8 on the circle with the corresponding point on the real line [[tangent|tan]](\u03b8/2).  This function is undefined at the point \u03c0, since tan(\u03c0/2) is undefined; we will identify this point with our point \u221e.\n\nSince tangents and inverse tangents are both continuous, our identification function is a [[homeomorphism]] between the real line and the unit circle without \u221e. What we have constructed is called the ''Alexandroff one-point compactification'' of the real line, discussed in more generality below. It is also possible to compactify the real line by adding ''two'' points, +\u221e and -\u221e; this results in the [[extended real line]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nAn [[embedding]] of a topological space ''X'' as a [[dense set|dense]] subset of a compact space is called a '''compactification''' of ''X''. It is often useful to embed [[topological space]]s in [[compact space]]s, because of the special properties compact spaces have.\n\nEmbeddings into compact [[Hausdorff space]]s may be of particular interest. Since every compact Hausdorff space is a [[Tychonoff space]], and every subspace of a Tychonoff space is Tychonoff, we conclude that any space possessing a Hausdorff compactification must be a Tychonoff space.  In fact, the converse is also true; being a Tychonoff space is both necessary and sufficient for possessing a Hausdorff compactification.\n\nThe fact that large and interesting classes of non-compact spaces do in fact have compactifications of particular sorts makes compactification a common technique in topology.\n\n===Alexandroff one-point compactification===\n{{main|One-point compactification}}\nFor any topological space ''X'' the ('''Alexandroff''') '''one-point compactification''' \u03b1''X'' of ''X'' is obtained by adding one extra point \u221e (often called a ''point at infinity'') and defining the [[open set]]s of the new space to be the open sets of ''X'' together with the sets of the form ''G''&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;{\u221e}, where ''G'' is an open subset of ''X'' such that ''X'' \\ ''G'' is compact. The one-point compactification of ''X'' is Hausdorff if and only if ''X'' is Hausdorff and [[locally compact]].<ref>{{citation|first=Pavel S.|last= Alexandroff|authorlink=Pavel Alexandroff| journal=  [[Mathematische Annalen]] |volume= 92|issue=3-4  |year=1924|pages= 294\u2013301|title= \u00dcber die Metrisation der im Kleinen kompakten topologischen R\u00e4ume | url=https://eudml.org/doc/159072 | doi=10.1007/BF01448011 | jfm=50.0128.04 }}</ref>\n\n===Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification===\n{{main|Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification}}\nOf particular interest are Hausdorff compactifications, i.e., compactifications in which the compact space is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]. A topological space has a Hausdorff compactification if and only if it is [[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]. In this case, there is a unique ([[up to]] [[homeomorphism]]) \"most general\" Hausdorff compactification, the [[Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification]] of ''X'', denoted by \u03b2''X''; formally, this exhibits the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of Compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps as a [[reflective subcategory]] of the category of Tychonoff spaces and continuous maps.\n\n\"Most general\" or formally \"reflective\" means that the space \u03b2''X'' is characterized by the [[universal property]] that any [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]] from ''X'' to a compact Hausdorff space ''K'' can be extended to a continuous function from \u03b2''X'' to ''K'' in a unique way. More explicitly, \u03b2''X'' is a compact Hausdorff space containing ''X'' such that the [[subspace topology|induced topology]] on ''X'' by \u03b2''X'' is the same as the given topology on ''X'', and for any continuous map ''f'':''X'' \u2192 ''K'', where ''K'' is a compact Hausdorff space, there is a unique continuous map ''g'':\u03b2''X'' \u2192 ''K'' for which ''g'' restricted to ''X'' is identically ''f''.\n\nThe Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification can be constructed explicitly as follows: let ''C'' be the set of continuous functions from ''X'' to the closed interval [0,1].  Then each point in ''X'' can be identified with an evaluation function on ''C''.  Thus ''X'' can be identified with a subset of [0,1]<sup>''C''</sup>, the space of ''all'' functions from ''C'' to [0,1].  Since the latter is compact by [[Tychonoff's theorem]], the closure of ''X'' as a subset of that space will also be compact.  This is the Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification.<ref>{{cite book|first=Eduard|last= \u010cech|authorlink=Eduard \u010cech| title=On bicompact spaces|journal=  [[Annals of Mathematics]] |volume= 38  |year=1937  |pages= 823\u2013844|doi=10.2307/1968839|issue=4|jstor=1968839}}</ref>\n<ref>{{citation|first=Marshall H.|last= Stone|authorlink=Marshall Harvey Stone|title=Applications of the theory of Boolean rings to general topology  |journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume= 41  |year=1937|pages= 375\u2013481\n|issue=3|doi=10.2307/1989788 |jstor=1989788}}</ref>\n\n==Projective space==\n[[Real projective space]] '''RP'''<sup>''n''</sup> is a compactification of Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. For each possible \"direction\" in which points in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> can \"escape\", one new point at infinity is added (but each direction is identified with its opposite). The Alexandroff one-point compactification of '''R''' we constructed in the example above is in fact homeomorphic to '''RP'''<sup>1</sup>. Note however that the [[projective plane]] '''RP'''<sup>2</sup> is ''not'' the one-point compactification of the plane '''R'''<sup>2</sup> since more than one point is added.\n\n[[Complex projective space]] '''CP'''<sup>''n''</sup> is also a compactification of  '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>; the Alexandroff one-point compactification of the plane '''C''' is (homeomorphic to) the complex projective line '''CP'''<sup>1</sup>, which in turn can be identified with a sphere, the [[Riemann sphere]].\n\nPassing to projective space is a common tool in [[algebraic geometry]] because the added points at infinity lead to simpler formulations of many theorems. For example, any two different lines in '''RP'''<sup>2</sup> intersect in precisely one point, a statement that is not true in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. More generally, [[B\u00e9zout's theorem]], which is fundamental in [[intersection theory]], holds in projective space but not affine space. This distinct behavior of intersections in affine space and projective space is reflected in [[algebraic topology]] in the [[cohomology ring]]s \u2013 the cohomology of affine space is trivial, while the cohomology of projective space is non-trivial and reflects the key features of intersection theory (dimension and degree of a subvariety, with intersection being [[Poincar\u00e9 dual]] to the [[cup product]]).\n\nCompactification of [[moduli space]]s generally require allowing certain degeneracies \u2013 for example, allowing certain singularities or reducible varieties. This is notably used in the Deligne\u2013Mumford compactification of the [[Moduli of algebraic curves|moduli space of algebraic curves]].\n\n==Compactification and discrete subgroups of Lie groups==\n\nIn the study of [[discrete space|discrete]] subgroups of [[Lie group]]s, the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of [[coset]]s is often a candidate for more subtle '''compactification''' to preserve structure at a richer level than just topological.\n\nFor example, [[modular curve]]s are compactified by the addition of single points for each [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]], making them [[Riemann surface]]s (and so, since they are compact, [[algebraic curve]]s). Here the cusps are there for a good reason: the curves parametrize a space of [[lattice (group)|lattices]], and those lattices can degenerate ('go off to infinity'), often in a number of ways (taking into account some auxiliary structure of ''level''). The cusps stand in for those different 'directions to infinity'.\n\nThat is all for lattices in the plane. In ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] the same questions can be posed, for example about SO(n)\\SL<sub>''n''</sub>('''R''')/SL<sub>''n''</sub>('''Z'''). This is harder to compactify. There are a variety of compactifications, such as the [[Borel-Serre compactification]], the [[reductive Borel-Serre compactification]], and the [[Satake compactification]]s, that can be formed.\n\n==Other compactification theories==\n\n*The theories of [[end (topology)|ends of a space]] and [[prime end]]s.\n*Some 'boundary' theories such as the [[collaring of an open manifold]], [[Martin boundary]], [[Shilov boundary]] and [[Furstenberg boundary]].\n*The [[Bohr compactification]] of a [[topological group]] arises from the consideration of [[almost periodic function]]s.\n*The [[projective line over a ring]] for a [[topological ring]] may compactify it.\n*The [[Baily-Borel compactification]] of a quotient of a [[Hermitian symmetric space]].\n*The [[wonderful compactification]] of a quotient of algebraic groups.\n*The compactifications that are simultaneously convex subsets in a locally convex space are called [[convex compactification]]s, their additional linear structure allowing e.g. for developing a differential calculus and more advanced considerations e.g. in relaxation in variational calculus or optimization theory.<ref>{{cite book | last=Roub\u00ed\u010dek | first=T. | authorlink=Tomas Roubicek | title=Relaxation in Optimization Theory and Variational Calculus | publisher=[[W. de Gruyter]] |place = Berlin | year=1997 | isbn=3-11-014542-1}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Compactification| ]]", "sha1": "s382lfuc9fp4oqcqjlzoh2bi9gpfdg1"}}, {"title": "Cotangent space", "ns": "0", "id": "6620", "revision": {"id": "768000608", "parentid": "767170040", "timestamp": "2017-03-01T05:07:56Z", "contributor": {"username": "Lepricavark", "id": "28779459"}, "comment": "Disambiguated: [[Ralph Abraham]] \u2192 [[Ralph Abraham (mathematician)]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "In [[differential geometry]], one can attach to every point ''x'' of a [[smooth manifold|smooth (or differentiable) manifold]] a [[vector space]] called the '''cotangent space''' at ''x''. Typically, the cotangent space is defined as the [[dual space]] of the [[tangent space]] at ''x'', although there are more direct definitions (see below). The elements of the cotangent space are called '''cotangent vectors''' or '''tangent covectors'''.\n\n==Properties==\nAll cotangent spaces on a connected manifold have the same [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]], equal to the dimension of the manifold. All the cotangent spaces of a manifold can be \"glued together\" (i.e. unioned and endowed with a topology) to form a new differentiable manifold of twice the dimension, the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.\n\nThe tangent space and the cotangent space at a point are both real vector spaces of the same dimension and therefore [[isomorphic]] to each other via many possible isomorphisms. The introduction of a [[Riemannian metric]] or a [[symplectic form]] gives rise to a [[natural isomorphism]] between the tangent space and the cotangent space at a point, associating to any tangent covector a canonical tangent vector.\n\n==Formal definitions==\n\n===Definition as linear functionals===\n\nLet ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''x'' be a point in ''M''. Let ''T''<sub>''x''</sub>''M'' be the [[tangent space]] at ''x''. Then the cotangent space at ''x'' is defined as the [[dual space]] of ''T''<sub>''x''</sub>''M'':\n:''T''<sub>''x''</sub><sup>*</sup>''M'' = (''T''<sub>''x''</sub>''M'')<sup>*</sup>\nConcretely, elements of the cotangent space are [[linear functional]]s on ''T''<sub>''x''</sub>''M''. That is, every element \u03b1 \u2208 ''T''<sub>''x''</sub><sup>*</sup>''M'' is a [[linear map]]\n:&alpha; : ''T''<sub>''x''</sub>''M'' &rarr; '''F'''\nwhere '''F''' is the underlying [[field (mathematics)|field]] of the vector space being considered. For example, the field of [[real number]]s. The elements of ''T''<sub>''x''</sub><sup>*</sup>''M'' are called cotangent vectors.\n\n===Alternative definition===\n\nIn some cases, one might like to have a direct definition of the cotangent space without reference to the tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of [[equivalence class]]es of smooth functions on ''M''. Informally, we will say that two smooth functions ''f'' and ''g'' are equivalent at a point ''x'' if they have the same first-order behavior near ''x'', analogous to their linear Taylor polynomials; two functions ''f'' and ''g'' have the same first order behaviour near ''x'' if and only if the derivative of the function ''f''-''g'' vanishes at ''x''. The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near ''x''.\n\nLet ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''x'' be a point in ''M''. Let ''I''<sub>''x''</sub> be the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of all functions in C<sup>\u221e</sup>(''M'') vanishing at ''x'', and let ''I''<sub>''x''</sub><sup>2</sup> be the set of functions of the form <math>\\sum_i f_i g_i\\,</math>, where ''f''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''g''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2208 ''I''<sub>''x''</sub>. Then ''I''<sub>''x''</sub> and ''I''<sub>''x''</sub><sup>2</sup> are real vector spaces and the cotangent space is defined as the [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] ''T''<sub>''x''</sub><sup>*</sup>''M'' = ''I''<sub>''x''</sub> / ''I''<sub>''x''</sub><sup>2</sup>.\n\nThis formulation is analogous to the construction of the cotangent space to define the [[Zariski tangent space]] in algebraic geometry. The construction also generalizes to [[locally ringed space]]s.\n\n==The differential of a function==\n\nLet ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''f'' \u2208 C<sup>\u221e</sup>(''M'') be a [[smooth function]]. The differential of ''f'' at a point ''x'' is the map\n:d''f''<sub>''x''</sub>(''X''<sub>''x''</sub>) = ''X''<sub>''x''</sub>(''f'')\nwhere ''X''<sub>''x''</sub> is a [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]] at ''x'', thought of as a derivation. That is <math>X(f)=\\mathcal{L}_Xf</math> is the [[Lie derivative]] of ''f'' in the direction ''X'', and one has d''f''(''X'')=''X''(''f'').  Equivalently, we can think of tangent vectors as tangents to curves, and write\n:d''f''<sub>''x''</sub>(&gamma;&prime;(0)) = (''f'' o &gamma;)&prime;(0)\nIn either case, d''f''<sub>''x''</sub> is a linear map on ''T''<sub>''x''</sub>''M'' and hence it is a tangent covector at ''x''.\n\nWe can then define the differential map d : C<sup>\u221e</sup>(''M'') \u2192 ''T''<sub>''x''</sub><sup>*</sup>''M'' at a point ''x'' as the map which sends ''f'' to d''f''<sub>''x''</sub>. Properties of the differential map include:\n\n# d is a linear map: d(''af'' + ''bg'') = ''a'' d''f'' + ''b'' d''g'' for constants ''a'' and ''b'',\n# d(''fg'')<sub>''x''</sub> = ''f''(''x'')d''g''<sub>''x''</sub> + ''g''(''x'')d''f''<sub>''x''</sub>,\n\nThe differential map provides the link between the two alternate definitions of the cotangent space given above. Given a function ''f'' \u2208 ''I''<sub>''x''</sub> (a smooth function vanishing at ''x'') we can form the linear functional d''f''<sub>''x''</sub> as above. Since the map d restricts to 0 on ''I''<sub>''x''</sub><sup>2</sup> (the reader should verify this), d descends to a map from ''I''<sub>''x''</sub> / ''I''<sub>''x''</sub><sup>2</sup> to the dual of the tangent space, (''T''<sub>''x''</sub>''M'')<sup>*</sup>. One can show that this map is an isomorphism, establishing the equivalence of the two definitions.\n\n==The pullback of a smooth map==\n\nJust as every differentiable map ''f'' : ''M'' \u2192 ''N'' between manifolds induces a linear map (called the ''pushforward'' or ''derivative'') between the tangent spaces\n:<math>f_{*}^{}\\colon T_x M \\to T_{f(x)} N</math>\nevery such map induces a linear map (called the ''[[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]]'') between the cotangent spaces, only this time in the reverse direction:\n:<math>f^{*}\\colon T_{f(x)}^{*} N \\to T_{x}^{*} M</math>\nThe pullback is naturally defined as the dual (or transpose) of the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]]. Unraveling the definition, this means the following:\n:<math>(f^{*}\\theta)(X_x) = \\theta(f_{*}^{}X_x)</math>\nwhere \u03b8 \u2208 ''T''<sub>''f''(''x'')</sub><sup>*</sup>''N'' and ''X''<sub>''x''</sub> \u2208 ''T''<sub>''x''</sub>''M''. Note carefully where everything lives.\n\nIf we define tangent covectors in terms of equivalence classes of smooth maps vanishing at a point then the definition of the pullback is even more straightforward. Let ''g'' be a smooth function on ''N'' vanishing at ''f''(''x''). Then the pullback of the covector determined by ''g'' (denoted d''g'') is given by\n:<math>f^{*}\\mathrm dg = \\mathrm d(g \\circ f).</math>\nThat is, it is the equivalence class of functions on ''M'' vanishing at ''x'' determined by ''g'' o ''f''.\n\n==Exterior powers==\n\nThe ''k''-th [[exterior power]] of the cotangent space, denoted \u039b<sup>''k''</sup>(''T''<sub>''x''</sub><sup>*</sup>''M''), is another important object in differential geometry. Vectors in the ''k''th exterior power, or more precisely sections of the ''k''-th exterior power of the [[cotangent bundle]], are called [[differential form|differential ''k''-forms]]. They can be thought of as alternating, [[multilinear map]]s on ''k'' tangent vectors. \nFor this reason, tangent covectors are frequently called ''[[one-form]]s''.\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last1=Abraham | first1=Ralph H. | author1-link=Ralph Abraham (mathematician) | last2=Marsden | first2=Jerrold E. | author2-link=Jerrold E.

They have two basic body forms: swimming [[Medusa (biology)|medusa]]e and [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] [[polyp]]s, both of which are [[Symmetry (biology)#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] with mouths surrounded by [[Tentacle|tentacles]] that bear cnidocytes. Both forms have a single [[Body orifice|orifice]] and body cavity that are used for [[digestion]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Many cnidarian species produce [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] that are single organisms composed of [[medusa]]-like or [[polyp]]-like zooids, or both (hence they are [[Trimorphism|trimorphic]]). Cnidarians' activities are coordinated by a decentralized [[nerve]] net and simple receptors. Several free-swimming species of [[Cubozoa]] and [[Scyphozoa]] possess balance-sensing [[statocyst]]s, and some have simple eyes.

Both are [[Symmetry (biology)#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]], like a wheel and a tube respectively. Since these animals have no heads, their ends are described as \"oral\" (nearest the mouth) and \"aboral\" (furthest from the mouth). Most have fringes of tentacles equipped with cnidocytes around their edges, and medusae generally have an inner ring of tentacles around the mouth. Some hydroids may consist of colonies of [[zooid]]s that serve different purposes, such as defense, reproduction and catching prey. The [[mesoglea]] of polyps is usually thin and often soft, but that of medusae is usually thick and springy, so that it returns to its original shape after muscles around the edge have contracted to squeeze water out, enabling medusae to swim by a sort of [[jet propulsion]].<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Skeletons===\nIn medusae the only supporting structure is the [[mesoglea]]. ''[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and most [[sea anemone]]s close their mouths when they are not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as ''[[Tubularia]]'' use columns of water-filled cells for support. [[Sea pen]]s stiffen the mesoglea with [[calcium carbonate]] [[wikt:spicule|spicule]]s and tough fibrous [[protein]]s, rather like [[sponge]]s.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nIn some colonial polyps, a [[chitin]]ous [[periderm]] gives support and some protection to the connecting sections and to the lower parts of individual polyps. [[Scleractinia|Stony coral]]s secrete massive calcium carbonate [[exoskeleton]]s. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with [[sediment]] particles.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Main cell layers===\nCnidaria are [[diploblastic]] animals; in other words, they have two main cell layers, while more complex animals are [[triploblast]]s having three main layers. The two main cell layers of cnidarians form [[epithelia]] that are mostly one cell thick, and are attached to a fibrous [[basement membrane]], which they [[secrete]]. They also secrete the jelly-like [[mesoglea]] that separates the layers. The layer that faces outwards, known as the [[ectoderm]] (\"outside skin\"), generally contains the following types of cells:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n*Epitheliomuscular cells whose bodies form part of the epithelium but whose bases extend to form [[muscle]] fibers in parallel rows.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004MuscleTissue\">{{cite book\n|author1=Ruppert, E.E. |author2=Fox, R.S. |author3=Barnes, R.D.  |last-author-amp=yes | title=Invertebrate Zoology\n| publisher=Brooks / Cole| edition=7| isbn=0-03-025982-7| year=2004| pages=103\u2013104| chapter=Introduction to Metazoa\n}}</ref> The fibers of the outward-facing cell layer generally run at right angles to the fibers of the inward-facing one.

[[Sensory neuron|Sensory]] cells appear between or sometimes on top of the muscle cells,<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> and communicate via [[synapse]]s (gaps across which chemical signals flow) with [[motor nerve]] cells, which lie mostly between the bases of the muscle cells.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n*Interstitial cells, which are unspecialized and can replace lost or damaged cells by transforming into the appropriate types. These are found between the bases of muscle cells.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nIn addition to epitheliomuscular, nerve and interstitial cells, the inward-facing [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]] (\"stomach skin\") contains [[gland]] cells that secrete digestive [[enzyme]]s.

Spirocysts do not have cilia.\n*A tough capsule, the [[cnida]], which houses the thread, its payload and a mixture of chemicals that may include venom or [[adhesive]]s or both. (\"cnida\" is derived from the Greek word \u03ba\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7, which means \"nettle\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary| contribution=Cnida\n|author1=Trumble, W. |author2=Brown, L.\n| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2002\n}}</ref>)\n*A tube-like extension of the wall of the cnida that points into the cnida, like the finger of a rubber glove pushed inwards. When a cnidocyte fires, the finger pops out. If the cell is a venomous nematocyte, the \"finger\"'s tip reveals a set of barbs that anchor it in the prey.\n*The thread, which is an extension of the \"finger\" and coils round it until the cnidocyte fires. The thread is usually hollow and delivers chemicals from the cnida to the target.\n*An [[Operculum (animal)|operculum]] (lid) over the end of the cnida. The lid may be a single hinged flap or three flaps arranged like slices of pie.\n*The cell body, which produces all the other parts.\n\nIt is difficult to study the firing mechanisms of cnidocytes as these structures are small but very complex. At least four hypotheses have been proposed:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n*Rapid contraction of fibers round the cnida may increase its internal pressure.\n*The thread may be like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released.\n*In the case of ''[[Chironex]]'' (the \"sea wasp\"), chemical changes in the cnida's contents may cause them to expand rapidly by [[polymerization]].\n*Chemical changes in the liquid in the cnida make it a much more [[concentration|concentrated]] solution, so that [[osmotic pressure]] forces water in very rapidly to dilute it. This mechanism has been observed in nematocysts of the class [[Hydrozoa]], sometimes producing pressures as high as 140 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]], similar to that of [[Scuba set|scuba]] air tanks, and fully extending the thread in as little as 2&nbsp;milliseconds (0.002&nbsp;second).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nCnidocytes can only fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when capturing a [[brine shrimp]]. Used cnidocytes have to be replaced, which takes about 48&nbsp;hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby [[sensory neuron|sensory]] cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, the rest of the group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Locomotion===\n[[File:Chrysaora quinquecirrha-Sea nettle (jellyfish).ogg|thumb| right| 200px| A swimming sea nettle known as the purple-striped jelly (''[[Chrysaora colorata]]'')]]\nMedusae swim by a form of jet propulsion: muscles, especially inside the rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]s and some [[sea anemone]]s can move slowly over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means: creeping like snails, crawling like [[Geometer moth|inchworm]]s, or by [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|somersault]]ing. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Nervous system and senses===\nCnidarians are generally thought to have no brains or even central nervous systems. However, they do have integrative areas of neural tissue that could be considered some form of centralization. Most of their bodies are innervated by decentralized nerve nets that control their swimming musculature and connect with sensory structures, though each clade has slightly different structures.<ref name=SatterlieCentral>{{Cite journal|last=Satterlie|first=Richard A.|date=15 April 2011|title=Do jellyfish have central nervous systems?|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1215|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|language=en|volume=214|issue=8|pages=1215\u20131223|doi=10.1242/jeb.043687|issn=0022-0949|pmid=21430196}}</ref> These sensory structures, usually called rhopalia, can generate signals in response to various types of stimuli such as light, pressure, and much more. Medusa usually have several of them around the margin of the bell that work together to control the motor nerve net, that directly innervates the swimming muscles. Most Cnidarians also have a parallel system. In scyphozoans, this takes the form of a diffuse nerve net, which has modulatory effects on the nervous system.<ref name=SatterlieControl>{{Cite journal|last=Satterlie|first=Richard A|date=2002-10-01|title=Neuronal control of swimming in jellyfish: a comparative story|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z02-132|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=80|issue=10|pages=1654\u20131669|doi=10.1139/z02-132|issn=0008-4301}}</ref> As well as forming the \"signal cables\" between sensory neurons and motoneurons, intermediate neurons in the nerve net can also form ganglia that act as local coordination centers. Communication between nerve cells can occur by chemical synapses or gap junctions in hydrozoans, though gap junctions are not present in all groups. Cnidarians have many of the same neurotransmitters as many animals, including chemicals such as glutamate, GABA, and acetylcholine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kass-Simon|first=G.|last2=Pierobon|first2=Paola|date=1 January 2007|title=Cnidarian chemical neurotransmission, an updated overview|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1095643306004077|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology|volume=146|issue=1|pages=9\u201325|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.09.008|pmid=17101286}}</ref>\n\nThis structure ensures that the musculature is excited rapidly and simultaneously, and can be directly stimulated from any point on the body, and it also is better able to recover after injury.<ref name=SatterlieCentral/><ref name=SatterlieControl />\n\nMedusae and complex swimming colonies such as [[siphonophore]]s and [[chondrophore]]s sense tilt and acceleration by means of [[statocyst]]s, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called statoliths.

Most species have [[ocelli]] (\"simple eyes\"), which can detect sources of light. However, the agile [[box jellyfish]] are unique among Medusae because they possess four kinds of true eyes that have [[retinas]], [[cornea]]s and [[lens (anatomy)|lenses]].<ref name=\"live\">{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/7243-jellyfish-human-eyes.html|title=Jellyfish Have Human-Like Eyes|publisher=www.livescience.com|date=April 1, 2007|accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref> Although the eyes probably do not form images, Cubozoa can clearly distinguish the direction from which light is coming as well as negotiate around solid-colored objects.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"live\" />\n\n===Feeding and excretion===\nCnidarians feed in several ways: [[predation]], absorbing dissolved [[organic matter|organic]] chemicals, [[filter feeding|filtering]] food particles out of the water, obtaining [[nutrients]] from [[symbiotic]] [[algae]] within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain the majority of their food from predation but some, including the [[coral]]s ''[[Hetroxenia]]'' and ''[[Leptogorgia]]'', depend almost completely on their [[endosymbiont]]s and on absorbing dissolved nutrients.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae [[carbon dioxide]], some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nPredatory species use their [[cnidocyte]]s to poison or entangle prey, and those with venomous [[nematocyst]]s may start digestion by injecting digestive [[enzyme]]s. The \"smell\" of fluids from wounded prey makes the tentacles fold inwards and wipe the prey off into the mouth. In medusae the tentacles round the edge of the bell are often short and most of the prey capture is done by \"oral arms\", which are extensions of the edge of the mouth and are often frilled and sometimes branched to increase their surface area. Medusae often trap prey or suspended food particles by swimming upwards, spreading their tentacles and oral arms and then sinking. In species for which suspended food particles are important, the tentacles and oral arms often have rows of [[cilia]] whose beating creates currents that flow towards the mouth, and some produce nets of [[mucus]] to trap particles.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Their digestion is both intra and extracellular.\n\nOnce the food is in the digestive cavity, [[gland]] cells in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]] release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach all parts of the digestive cavity.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by [[diffusion]] or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick [[mesoglea]]s, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nIndigestible remains of prey are expelled through the mouth. The main waste product of cells' internal processes is [[ammonia]], which is removed by the external and internal water currents.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Respiration===\nThere are no respiratory organs, and both cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel [[carbon dioxide]] into the surrounding water. When the water in the digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some [[Anthozoa]] have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nCnidaria that carry [[photosynthetic]] [[symbiont]]s may have the opposite problem, an excess of oxygen, which may prove [[Oxygen toxicity|toxic]]. The animals produce large quantities of [[antioxidant]]s to neutralize the excess oxygen.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\n===Regeneration===\nAll cnidarians can [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]], allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]]. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\n==Reproduction==\n{{Annotated image| float=right| caption=Life cycle of a [[jellyfish]]:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /><br>'''1\u20133''' Larva searches for site<br>'''4\u20138''' Polyp grows<br>'''9\u201311''' Polyp [[strobilation|strobilates]]<br>'''12\u201314''' Medusa grows| image=Schleiden-meduse-2.jpg| width=193| image-width=200| height=292| annot-font-weight=bold| annot-background-color=yellow| annot-font-size=10\n| annotations=\n{{Annotation|100|231|&nbsp;1&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|60|232|&nbsp;2&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|9|232|&nbsp;3&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|4|260|&nbsp;4&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|40|260|&nbsp;5&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|78|260|&nbsp;6&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|120|260|&nbsp;7&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|151|216|&nbsp;8&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|166|147|&nbsp;9&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|104|159|&nbsp;10&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|50|162|&nbsp;11&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|29|38|&nbsp;12&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|87|60|&nbsp;13&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|161|62|&nbsp;14&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n}}\n\n===Sexual===\n\nCnidarian [[sexual reproduction]] often involves a complex life cycle with both [[polyp]] and [[Medusa (biology)|medusa]] stages. For example, in [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) a [[larva]] swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally into a series of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called [[strobilation]]. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have [[gonad]]s in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]], and these release [[ovum|ova]] and [[sperm]] into the water in the breeding season.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nThis phenomenon of succession of differently organized generations (one asexually reproducing, sessile polyp, followed by a [[free-swimming]] medusa or a sessile polyp that reproduces sexually)<ref>Vernon A.

[[Hydrozoa]] have a variety of life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. ''[[hydra (genus)|hydra]]'') have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain attached to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (''Turritopsis dohrnii''<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.icm.csic.es/scimar/pdf/56/sm56n2137.pdf|title = Bi-directional conversion in Turritopsis nutricula (Hydrozoa)|last = Bavestrello|date = 1992|journal = Scientia Marina|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-31|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and ''Laodicea undulata''<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|title = Evidence of reverse development in Leptomedusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): the case of Laodicea undulata (Forbes and Goodsir 1851)|last = De Vito|date = 2006|journal = Marine Biology|doi = 10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-31|display-authors=etal|volume=149|pages=339\u2013346}}</ref>) and Scyphozoa (''Aurelia'' sp.1<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|title = Life Cycle Reversal in Aurelia sp.1 (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa)|last = He|date = 21 December 2015|journal = PLOS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|pmid = 26690755|access-date = 2015-12-31|display-authors=etal|pmc=4687044|volume=10|pages=e0145314|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1045314H}}</ref>). [[Anthozoa]] have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nSpawning is generally driven by environmental factors such as changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the [[Lunar phase|phase of the moon]]. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, so that there are too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage&nbsp;\u2014 one famous example is the [[Great Barrier Reef]], where at least 110 [[coral]]s and a few non-cnidarian [[invertebrate]]s produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nThe fertilized eggs develop into larvae by dividing until there are enough cells to form a hollow sphere ([[blastula]]) and then a depression forms at one end ([[gastrulation]]) and eventually becomes the digestive cavity. However, in cnidarians the depression forms at the end further from the yolk (at the [[animal pole]]), while in [[bilaterian]]s it forms at the other end ([[vegetal pole]]).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> The larvae, called [[planula]]e, swim or crawl by means of [[cilia]].<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> They are cigar-shaped but slightly broader at the \"front\" end, which is the aboral, vegetal-pole end and eventually attaches to a substrate if the species has a polyp stage.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nAnthozoan larvae either have large [[yolk]]s or are capable of feeding on [[plankton]], and some already have [[endosymbiotic]] [[algae]] that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding capabilities extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and [[metamorphose]] into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Asexual===\nAll known cnidaria can reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] by various means, in addition to regenerating after being fragmented. [[Hydrozoa]]n polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. [[Scyphozoa]]n polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, [[Anthozoa]] can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n==Classification==\nCnidarians were for a long time grouped with [[Ctenophore]]s in the phylum [[Coelenterata]], but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main [[class (biology)|classes]]:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> sessile [[Anthozoa]] ([[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s); swimming [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies); and [[Hydrozoa]], a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and colonial swimmers such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]]. [[Staurozoa]] have recently been recognised as a [[class (biology)|class]] in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic [[Myxozoa]] and [[Polypodiozoa]] are now recognized as highly derived cnidarians rather than more closely related to the [[bilateria]]ns.<ref name=\"E.

The life cycles of most have polyp stages, which are limited to locations that offer stable substrates. Nevertheless, major cnidarian groups contain species that have escaped these limitations. [[Hydrozoan]]s have a worldwide range: some, such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'', live in freshwater; ''[[Obelia]]'' appears in the coastal waters of all the oceans; and ''Liriope''<!--****** at present the DAB page does not link to a cnidarian called Liriope ******--> can form large shoals near the surface in mid-ocean. Among [[anthozoa]]ns, a few [[scleractinia]]n [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s and [[gorgonia|sea fan]]s live in deep, cold waters, and some sea anemones inhabit polar seabeds while others live near [[hydrothermal vent]]s over {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} below sea-level.

In 1881, it was proposed that Ctenophora and Bilateria were more closely related to each other, since they shared features that Cnidaria lack, for example muscles in the middle layer ([[mesoglea]] in Ctenophora, [[mesoderm]] in Bilateria). However more recent analyses indicate that these similarities are rather vague, and the current view, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that Cnidaria and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to Ctenophora. This grouping of Cnidaria and Bilateria has been labelled \"[[Planulozoa]]\" because it suggests that the earliest Bilateria were similar to the [[planula]] larvae of Cnidaria.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\">{{cite journal\n| author=Collins, A.G.| date=May 2002\n| title=Phylogeny of Medusozoa and the Evolution of Cnidarian Life Cycles\n| journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology| volume=15| issue=3| pages=418\u2013432\n| doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00403.x\n| url=http://cima.uprm.edu/~n_schizas/CMOB_8676/Collins2002.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate=2008-11-27\n}}</ref><ref name=\"WallbergEtAl2004PhylogeneticPositionOfCtenophora\">{{cite journal\n| author=Wallberg, A. | author2=Thollesson, M. | author3=Farris, J.S. | author4=Jondelius, U. |last-author-amp=yes\n| title=The phylogenetic position of the comb jellies (Ctenophora) and the importance of taxonomic sampling\n| journal=Cladistics| volume=20| year=2004| pages=558\u2013578\n| doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2004.00041.x\n| issue=6\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin the Cnidaria, the Anthozoa (sea anemones and corals) are regarded as the sister-group of the rest, which suggests that the earliest cnidarians were [[sessility (zoology)|sessile]] polyps with no medusa stage. However, it is unclear how the other groups acquired the medusa stage, since [[Hydrozoa]] form medusae by budding from the side of the polyp while the other Medusozoa do so by splitting them off from the tip of the polyp. The traditional grouping of [[Scyphozoa]] included the [[Staurozoa]], but morphology and molecular phylogenetics indicate that Staurozoa are more closely related to [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) than to other \"Scyphozoa\". Similarities in the double body walls of Staurozoa and the extinct [[Conulariida]] suggest that they are closely related. The position of Anthozoa nearest the beginning of the cnidarian family tree also implies that Anthozoa are the cnidarians most closely related to Bilateria, and this is supported by the fact that Anthozoa and Bilateria share some genes that determine the main [[Axis of symmetry|axes]] of the body.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\" /><ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Marques, A.C. |author2=Collins, A.G.| year=2004\n| title=Cladistic analysis of Medusozoa and cnidarian evolution\n| journal=Invertebrate Biology| volume=123| issue=1| pages=23\u201342| doi=10.1111/j.1744-7410.2004.tb00139.x\n| url=http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=sourceget&id=38492| accessdate=2008-11-27\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid suggested that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of [[triploblastic]] animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have [[striated muscle]], which in bilaterians arises from the [[mesoderm]].

The Conservative rabbinate therefore employs modern [[Historical criticism|historical-critical]] research, rather than only traditional methods and sources, and lends great weight to its constituency when determining its stance on matters of law. The movement considers its approach as the authentic and most appropriate continuation of ''halakhic'' discourse, maintaining both fealty to received forms and flexibility in their interpretation. It also eschews strict theological definitions, lacking a consensus in matters of faith and allowing great pluralism.\n\nWhile regarding itself as the heir of Rabbi [[Zecharias Frankel]]'s 19th-century Positive-Historical School in Europe, Conservative Judaism fully institutionalized as a denomination only in the United States during the mid-20th century. Its largest center today is in North America, where its main congregational arm is the [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]] and the New York\u2013based [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] operates as rabbinic seminary. Worldwide, affiliated communities are united within the umbrella organization [[Masorti Olami]]. Conservative Judaism is estimated to represent close to 1.1 million people, both more than 600,000 registered adult congregants and many non-member identifiers.\n\nThe term ''conservative'' was meant to signify that Jews should attempt to conserve Jewish tradition, rather than reform or abandon it, and does not imply the movement's adherents are [[Conservatism|politically conservative]].\n\n==Theology==\n===Attitude===\nConservative Judaism, from its earliest stages, was marked by ambivalence and ambiguity in all matters theological. Rabbi [[Zecharias Frankel]], considered its intellectual progenitor, believed the very notion of theology was alien to traditional Judaism. He was often accused of obscurity on the subject by his opponents, both Reform and Orthodox. The American movement largely espoused a similar approach, and its leaders mostly avoided the field. Only in 1985 did a course about Conservative theology open in the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTS). The hitherto sole major attempt to define a clear credo was made in 1988, with the Statement of Principles ''Emet ve-Emunah'' (Truth and Belief), formulated and issued by the [[Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism]]. The introduction stated that \"lack of definition was useful\" in the past but a need to articulate one now arose. The platform provided many statements citing key concepts such as God, revelation and [[Election of Israel|Election]], but also acknowledged that a variety of positions and convictions existed within denominational ranks, eschewing strict delineation of principles and often expressing conflicting views.<ref>[[Daniel Gordis]], ''Conservative Judaism: The Struggle between Ideology and Popularity'', in: Jacob Neusner ed., ''The Blackwell Companion to Judaism'', [[Blackwell Publishing]], 2003. pp. 338-342.</ref><ref name=\"AS\">[[Alan Silverstein]], ''Modernists vs. Traditionalists: Competition for Legitimacy within American Conservative Judaism'', in: ''Studies in Contemporary Jewry, Volume XVII'', Oxford University Press, 2001. pp. 40-43.</ref><ref>[[Daniel J.

Dorff]] and [[Gordon Tucker]] clarified that \"the great diversity\" within the movement \"makes the creation of a theological vision shared by all neither possible nor desirable\".<ref>''\u201dIf you are My witnesses...\u201d: Special Issue on Theology''. Conservative Judaism 51, no. 2 (Winter 1999). p. 13.</ref>\n\n===God and eschatology===\nConservative Judaism largely upholds the [[theistic]] notion of a [[personal God]]. ''Emet ve-Emunah'' stated that \"we affirm our faith in God as the Creator and Governor of the universe. His power called the world into being; His wisdom and goodness guide its destiny.\"   \nConcurrently, the platform also noted that His nature was \"elusive\" and subject to many options of belief. A [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] conception of divinity, regarding it as inseparable from the mundane world, once had an important place within the denomination, especially represented by [[Mordecai Kaplan]]. After Kaplan's [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionism]] fully coalesced into an independent movement, these views were marginalized.<ref>''\u201dIf you are My witnesses...\u201d'', pp. 41, 59.; Gordis, 353-354.</ref>\n\nA similarly inconclusive position is expressed toward other precepts. Most theologians adhere to the [[Immortality of the Soul]], but while references to the [[Resurrection of the Dead]] are maintained, English translations of the prayers obscure the issue. In ''Emet'', it was stated that death is not tantamount to the end of one's personality. Relating to the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messianic ideal]], the movement rephrased most petitions for the restoration of the [[Korban|Sacrifices]] into past tense, rejecting a renewal of animal offerings, though not opposing a [[Gathering of Israel|Return to Zion]] and even a [[Third Temple|new Temple]]. The 1988 platform announced that \"some\" believe in classic eschathology, but dogmatism in this matter was \"philosophically unjustified\". The notions of [[Election of Israel]] and God's covenant with it were basically retained as well.<ref>[[Elliot N. Dorff]], ''Conservative Judaism: Our Ancestors To Our Descendants'', United Synagogue New York, 1996. pp. 49 ,201-202; Martha Himmelfarb, ''Resurrection'', in: Adele Berlin (ed.), ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'', Oxford University Press, 2011. p. 624</ref>\n\n===Revelation===\nConservative conception of [[Revelation]] encompasses an extensive spectrum. Zecharias Frankel himself applied critical-scientific methods to analyze the stages in the development of the [[Oral Torah]], pioneering modern study of the [[Mishnah]]. He regarded the [[Chazal|Beatified Sages]] as innovators who added their own, original contribution to the canon, not merely as expounders and interpreters of a legal system given in its entirety to [[Moses]] on Mount Sinai. Yet he also vehemently rejected utilizing these disciplines on the Pentateuch, maintaining it was beyond human reach and wholly celestial in origin. Frankel never elucidated his beliefs, and the exact correlation between human and divine in his thought is still subject to scholarly debate.<ref name=\"MM\">Michael Meyer, ''Response to Modernity: A History of the Reform Movement in Judaism'', Wayne State, 1995. pp. 84-89, 414.</ref> A similar negative approach toward [[Higher Criticism]], while accepting an evolutionary understanding of Oral Law, defined Rabbi [[Alexander Kohut]], [[Solomon Schechter]] and the early generation of American Conservative Judaism. When JTS faculty began to embrace Biblical criticism in the 1920s, they adapted a theological view consistent with it: an original, verbal revelation did occur at Sinai, but the text itself was composed by later authors. The latter, classified by Dorff as a relatively moderate metamorphosis of the old one, is still espoused by few traditionalist right-wing Conservative rabbis, though it is marginalized among senior leadership.<ref name=\"AS\"/><ref>Dorff, pp. 103-105</ref>\n\nA small but influential segment within the JTS and the movement adhered, from the 1930s, to Mordecai Kaplan's philosophy that denied any form of revelation but viewed all scripture as a purely human product. Along with other Reconstructionist tenets, it dwindled as the latter consolidated into a separate group. Kaplan's views and the permeation of Higher Criticism gradually swayed most Conservative thinkers towards a non-verbal understanding of theophany, which has become dominant in the 1970s. This was en sync with the wider trend of lowering rates of Americans who accepted the Bible as the Word of God.<ref name=\"AS\"/><ref>Dorff, pp. 107-108.</ref> Dorff categorized the proponents of this into two schools. One maintains that God projected some form of message which inspired the human authors of the Pentateuch to record what they perceived. The other is often strongly influenced by  [[Franz Rosenzweig]] and other [[Jewish existentialism|existentialists]], but also attracted many [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivists]] who consider human reason paramount. The second school states that God conferred merely his presence on those he influenced, without any communication, and the experience drove them to spiritual creativity. While they differ in the theoretical level surrounding revelation, both practically regard all scripture and religious tradition as a human product with certain divine inspiration \u2013 providing an understanding that recognizes Biblical Criticism and also justifies major innovation in religious conduct. The first doctrine, advocated by such leaders as rabbis [[Ben-Zion Bokser]] and [[Robert Gordis]], largely imparted that some elements within Judaism are fully divine but determining which would be impractical, and therefore received forms of interpretation should be basically upheld. Exponents of the latter view, among them rabbis [[Louis Jacobs]] and [[Neil Gillman]], also emphasized the encounter of God with the Jews as a collective and the role of religious authorities through the generations in determining what it implied. The stress on the supremacy of community and tradition, rather than individual consciousness, defines the entire spectrum of Conservative thought.<ref>Dorff, pp. 107-114.</ref>\n\n==Ideology==\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|expanded=denominations}}\nThe Conservative mainstay was the adoption of the historical-critical method in understanding Judaism and setting its future course. In accepting an evolutionary approach to the religion, as something that developed over time and absorbed considerable external influences, the movement distinguished between the original meaning implied in traditional sources and the manner they were grasped by successive generations, rejecting belief in an unbroken chain of interpretation from God's original Revelation, immune to any major extraneous effects. This evolutionary perception of religion, while relatively moderate in comparison with more radical modernizers&nbsp;\u2013 the scholarship of the Positive-Historical school, for example, sought to demonstrate the continuity and cohesiveness of Judaism along the years&nbsp;\u2013 still challenged Conservative leaders.\n\nThey regarded tradition and received mores with reverence, especially the continued adherence to the mechanism of Religious Law (''[[Halakha]]''), opposing indiscriminate modification, and emphasized they should be changed only with care and caution, and remain observed by the people. Rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]], summarizing his movement's position, wrote:\n{{quote|We may now understand the apparent contradiction between the theory and practice... One may conceive of the origin of [[Sabbath]] as the professor at university would, yet observe the smallest detail known to strict Orthodoxy... The sanctity of the Sabbath reposes not upon the fact that it was proclaimed on Sinai, but on the fact that it found for thousands of years its expression in Jewish souls. It is the task of the historian to examine into the beginnings and developments of customs and observances; practical Judaism on the other hand is not concerned with origins, but regards the institutions as they have come to be.}}\nThis discrepancy between scientific criticism and insistence on heritage had to be compensated by a conviction that would forestall either deviation from accepted norms or laxity and apathy.<ref>Dorff, pp. 20-23; [[David Golinkin]], ''Halakha For Our Time: A Conservative Approach To Jewish Law'', United Synagogue, 1991. pp. 13-17. See also: S.H. Schwartz, [http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=8820 Conservative Judaism's 'Ideology' Problem.]</ref>\n\nA key doctrine which was to fulfill this capacity was the collective will of the Jewish people. Conservatives lent it great weight in determining religious practice, both in historical precedent and as a means to shape present conduct. [[Zecharias Frankel]] pioneered this approach; as Michael A. Meyer commented, \"the extraordinary status which he ascribed to the ingrained beliefs and practices of the community is probably the most original element of his thought.\" He turned it into a source of legitimacy for both change and preservation, but mostly the latter. The basic moderation and traditionalism of the majority among the people were to guarantee a sense of continuity and unity, restraining the guiding rabbis and scholars who at his age were intent on reform, but also allowing them maneuverability in adopting or discarding certain elements.<ref name=\"MM\"/> [[Solomon Schechter]] espoused a similar position. He turned the old rabbinic concept of ''K'lal Yisrael'', which he translated as \"Catholic Israel\", into a comprehensive worldview. For him, the details of divine Revelation were of secondary significance, as historical change dictated its interpretation through the ages notwithstanding: \"the center of authority is actually removed from the Bible\", he surmised, \"and placed in some living body... in touch with the ideal aspirations and the religious needs of the age, best able to determine... This living body, however, is not represented by... priesthood, or Rabbihood, but by the collective conscience of Catholic Israel.\"<ref>[[Neil Gillman]], ''Conservative Judaism: The New Century'', Behrman House, 1993. pp. 54-56.</ref>\n\nThe scope, limits and role of this corpus were a matter for contention in Conservative ranks. Schechter himself used it to oppose any major break with either traditionalist or progressive elements within American Jewry of his day, while some of his successors argued that the idea became obsolete due to the great alienation of many from received forms, that had to be countered by innovative measures to draw them back. The Conservative rabbinate often vacillated on to which degree may the non-practicing, religiously apathetic strata be included as a factor within Catholic Israel, providing impulse for them in determining religious questions; even avant-garde leaders acquiesced that the majority could not serve that function. Right-wing critics often charged that the movement allowed its uncommitted laity an exaggerated role, conceding to its demands and successively stretching ''halakhic'' boundaries beyond any limit.<ref>Dorff, pp. 24-25;  Michael R. Cohen, ''The Birth of Conservative Judaism: Solomon Schechter's Disciples and the Creation of an American Religious Movement'', Columbia University Press, 2012. pp. 13-14, 18; Daniel H. Gordis, ''[http://danielgordis.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Positive-Historical-Judaism-Exhausted-Reflections-on-a-Movements-Future.pdf Positive-Historical Judaism Exhausted]''. in: [[Conservative Judaism (journal)|Conservative Judaism]], XLVII.</ref>\n\nThe Conservative leadership had limited success in imparting their worldview to the general public. While the rabbinate perceived itself as bearing a unique, original conception of Judaism, the masses lacked much interest, regarding it mainly as a compromise offering a channel for religious identification that was more traditional than [[Reform Judaism]] yet less strict than Orthodoxy. Only a low percentage of Conservative congregants actively pursue an observant lifestyle: in the mid-1980s, [[Charles Liebman]] and [[Daniel J. Elazar]] calculated that barely 3 to 4 per cent held to one quite thoroughly. This gap between principle and the public, more pronounced than in any other Jewish denomination, is often credited at explaining the decline of the Conservative movement. While some 41 per cent of American Jews identified with it in the 1970s, it had shrunk to an estimated 18 per cent (and 11 per cent among those under 30) in 2013.<ref>Gordis, ''Struggle between Ideology and Popularity'', pp. 345-248; Geffen, Elazar, pp. 4-5, 73, 105-106; Gordis, [http://jewishreviewofbooks.com/articles/566/requiem-for-a-movement/ Conservative Judaism: A Requiem], [[Jewish Review of Books]], Winter 2014.</ref>\n\n==Jewish law==\n{{main|Conservative Halakha}}\n\n===Role===\nFidelity and commitment to ''[[Halakha]]'', while subject to criticism as disingenuous both from within and without, were and remain a cornerstone doctrine of Conservative Judaism:<ref>Neil Gillman, ''Doing Jewish Theology: God, Torah and Israel in Modern Judaism'', Jewish Lights, 2008. p. 188.; Dana Evan Kaplan, ''Contemporary American Judaism: Transformation and Renewal'', Columbia University Press, 2013. p. 123;  Leonard Levin, [https://www.academia.edu/7818172 Is the \u201cHalakhic Authenticity\u201d of Conservative Judaism a Broken Myth?] in: Daniel Plevan ed., ''Personal Theology: Essays in Honor of Neil Gillman'', Academic Studies Press.</ref> The movement views the legalistic system as normative and binding, and believes Jews must practically observe its precepts, like Sabbath, dietary ordinances, ritual purity, daily prayer with [[Teffilin|phylacteries]] and the like. Concurrently, examining [[Jewish history]] and [[rabbinic literature]] through the lens of academic criticism, it maintained that these laws were always subject to considerable evolution, and must continue to do so. ''Emet ve-Emunah'' titled its chapter on the subject with \"The Indispensability of Halakha\", stating that \"''Halakha'' in its developing form is an indispensable element of a traditional Judaism which is vital and modern.\" Conservative Judaism regards itself as the authentic inheritor of a flexible legalistic tradition, charging the Orthodox with petrifying the process and Reform with abandoning it.\n\nThe tension between \"tradition and change\" \u2013 which were also the motto adopted by the movement since the 1950s \u2013 and the need to balance them were always a topic of intense debate within Conservative Judaism. In its early stages, the leadership opposed pronounced innovation, mostly adopting a relatively rigid position. [[Mordecai Kaplan]]'s Reconstructionism raised the demand for thoroughgoing modification without much regard for the past or ''halakhic'' considerations, but senior rabbis opposed him vigorously. Even in the 1940s and 1950s, when Kaplan's influence grew, his superiors rabbis Ginzberg, [[Louis Finkelstein]] and [[Saul Lieberman]] espoused a very conservative line. Since the 1970s, with the strengthening of the liberal wing within the denomination, the majority in the Rabbinic Assembly opted for quite radical reformulations in religious conduct, but rejected the Reconstructionist non-''halakhic'' approach, insisting that the legalistic method be maintained.<ref>Elazer, Minz-Geffen, pp. 63-65.</ref> The ''halakhic'' commitment of Conservative Judaism has been subject to much criticism, from within and without. Right-wing discontents, including the [[Union for Traditional Judaism]] which seceded in protest of the 1983 resolution to ordain women rabbis \u2014 adopted at an open vote, where all JTS faculty regardless of qualification were counted \u2014 contested the validity of this description, as well as progressives like Rabbi [[Neil Gillman]], who exhorted the denomination to cease describing itself as ''halakhic'' in 2005, stating that after repeated concessions, \"our original claim has died a death by a thousand qualifications... It has lost all factual meaning.\"<ref>Gillman, ''Doing Jewish Theology'', p. 190.</ref>\n\nThe main body entrusted with formulating rulings, responsa and statues is the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] (CJLS), a panel with 25 voting legalistic specialists and further 11 observers. There is also the smaller ''Va'ad ha-Halakha'' (Law Committee) of Israel's Masorti Movement. Every responsa must receive a minimum of six voters to be considered an official position of the CJLS. Conservative Judaism explicitly acknowledges the principle of ''halachik'' pluralism, enabling the panel to adopt more than one resolution in any given subject. The final authority in each Conservative community is the local rabbi, the ''mara d'atra'' (Lord of the Locality, in traditional terms), enfranchised to adopt either minority or majority opinions from the CJLS or maintain local practice. Thus, on the issue of admitting openly Homosexual rabbinic candidates, the Committee approved two resolutions, one in favour and one against; the JTS took the lenient position, while the [[Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano]] still adheres to the latter. Likewise, while most Conservative synagogues approved of egalitarianism for women in religious life, some still maintain traditional gender roles and do not count females for [[Minyan|prayer quorums]].\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe Conservative treatment of ''Halakha'' is defined by several features, though the entire range of denominational ''Halakhic'' discourse cannot be sharply distinguished from either the traditional or Orthodox one. Rabbi [[David Golinkin]], who attempted to classify its parameters, stressed that quite often rulings merely reiterate conclusions reached in older sources or even Orthodox ones. for example, in the details of preparing Sabbath [[Eruv|ritual enclosures]], it draws directly on the opinions of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' and Rabbi [[Hayim David HaLevi]]. Another tendency prevalent among the movement's rabbis, yet again not particular to it, is the adoption of the more lenient positions on the matters at question \u2014 though this is not universal, and responsa also took stringent ones not infrequently.<ref>Golinkin, ''Halakha For Our Time'', pp. 5, 9, 13.</ref>\n\nA more distinctive characterization is a greater proclivity to base rulings on earlier sources, in the ''[[Rishonim]]'' or before them, as far back as the Talmud. Conservative [[Posek|decisors]] frequently resort to less canonical sources, isolated responsa or minority opinions. They demonstrate more fluidity in regards to established precedent and continuum in rabbinic literature, mainly those by the later authorities, and lay little stress on the perceived hierarchy between major and minor legalists of the past. They are far more inclined to contend (''machloket'') with old rulings, to be flexible towards [[Minhag|custom]] or to wholly disregard it. This is especially expressed in less hesitancy to rule against or notwithstanding the major codifications of Jewish Law, like ''[[Mishne Torah]]'', ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and especially the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' with its [[Hamapah|Isserles Gloss]] and later commentaries. Conservative authorities, while often relying on the ''Shulchan Aruch'' themselves, criticize the Orthodox for relatively rarely venturing beyond it and overly canonizing Rabbi [[Joseph Karo]]'s work. In several occasions, Conservative rabbis discerned that the ''Shulchan Aruch'' ruled without firm precedent, sometimes deriving his conclusions from the ''[[Kabbalah]]''. An important example is the ruling of Rabbi Golinkin \u2014 contrary to the majority consensus among the ''[[Acharonim]]'' and the more prominent ''Rishonim'', but based on many opinions of the lesser ''Rishonim'' which is derived from a minority view in the Talmud \u2014 that the [[Sabbatical year (Bible)|Sabbatical Year]] is not obligatory in present times at all (neither [[List of Talmudic principles#De'oraita and derabanan|''de'Oraita'' nor ''de'Rabanan'']]) but rather an [[Hasidim|act of piety]].<ref>Golinkin, ''Halakha For Our Time'', pp. 26-31; See also [[Binyamin Lau]], \u05d4\u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d4 \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3 / \u05d4\u05db\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dd \u05d4\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05e1\u05e8\u05d1\u05d8\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05e2\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05d1\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d4, ''De'ot'', December 1999.</ref>\n\nEthical considerations and the weight due to them in determining ''halakhic'' issues, mainly to what degree may modern sensibilities shape the outcome, are subject to much discourse. Right-wing [[Posek|decisors]], like Rabbi [[Joel Roth]], maintained that such elements are naturally a factor in formulating conclusions, but may not alone serve as a justification for adopting a position. The majority, however, basically subscribed to the opinion evinced already by Rabbi [[Seymour Siegel]] in the 1960s, that the cultural and ethical norms of the community, the contemporary equivalents of Talmudic ''[[Aggadah]]'', should supersede the legalistic forms when the two came into conflict and there was a pivotal ethical concern. Rabbi Elliot Dorff concluded that in contrast to the Orthodox, the denomination maintains that the juridical details and processes mainly serve higher moral purposes and could be modified if they no longer do so: \"in other words, the ''Aggadah'' should control the ''Halakha''.\" The liberal Rabbi [[Gordon Tucker]], along with Gillman and other progressives, supported a far-reaching implementation of this approach, making Conservative Judaism much more ''Aggadic'' and allowing moral priorities an overriding authority at all occasions. This idea became very popular among the young generation, but it was not fully embraced either. In the 2006 resolution on homosexuals, the CJLS chose a middle path: they agreed that the ethical consideration of human dignity was of supreme importance, but not sufficient to uproot the express Biblical prohibition on not to lie with mankind as with womankind (traditionally understood as banning full anal intercourse). All other limitations, including on other forms of sexual relations, were lifted.<ref>Shai Cherry, ''[https://www.academia.edu/9047067/ Ethical Theories in the Conservative Movement]'', in: Elliot N.

The CJLS and the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members frequently state that circumstances were profoundly transformed in modern times, fulfilling the criteria mandating new rulings in various fields (based on general talmudic principles like ''Shinui ha-I'ttim'', \"Change of Times\"). This, along with the ethical aspect, was a main argument for revolutionizing the role of women in religious life and embracing egalitarianism.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of Conservative legalistic discourse, in which it is conspicuously and sharply different from Orthodoxy, is the incorporation of critical-scientific methods into the process. Deliberations almost always delineate the historical development of the specific issue at hand, from the earliest known mentions until modern times. This approach enables a thorough analysis of the manner in which it was practiced, accepted, rejected or modified in various periods, not necessarily en sync with the received rabbinic understanding. Archaeology, philology and [[Judaic Studies]] are employed; rabbis use comparative compendiums of religious manuscripts, sometimes discerning that sentences were only added later or include spelling, grammar and transcription errors, changing the entire understanding of certain passages. This critical approach is central to the movement, for its historicist underpinning stresses that all religious literature has an original meaning relevant in the context of its formulation. This meaning may be analyzed and discerned, and is distinct from the later interpretations ascribed by traditional commentators. Decisors are also far more prone to include references to external scientific sources in relevant fields, like veterinarian publications in ''halakhic'' matters concerning livestock.<ref>Golinkin, ''Halakha For Our Time'', pp. 30-41; Dorff, pp. 101-107 etc.</ref>\n\nConservative authorities, as part of their promulgation of a dynamic ''Halakha'', often cite the manner in which the sages of old used rabbinic statues (''[[Takkanah]]'') that enabled to bypass prohibitions in the Pentateuch, like the ''[[Prozbul]]'' or ''[[Heter iska|Heter I'ska]]''. In 1948, when employing those was first debated, Rabbi [[Isaac Klein]] argued that since there was no consensus on leadership within Catholic Israel, formulation of significant ''takkanot'' should be avoided. Another proposal, to ratify them only with a two-thirds majority in the RA, was rejected. New statues require a simple majority, 13 supporters among the 25 members of the CJLS. In the 1950s and 1960s, such drastic measures&nbsp;\u2014 as Rabbi Arnold M. Goodman cited in a 1996 writ allowing members of the priestly caste to marry divorcees, ''[[Acharonim|Later authorities]] were reluctant to assume such unilateral authority... fear that invoking this principle would create the proverbial slippery slope, thereby weakening the entire ''halakhic'' structure... thus imposed severe limitations on the conditions and situations where it would be appropriate''&nbsp;\u2014 were carefully drafted as temporal, emergency ordinances (''Horaat Sha'ah''), grounded on the need the avoid a total rift of many nonobservant Jews. Later on, these ordinances became accepted and permanent on the practical level. The Conservative movement issued a wide range of new, thoroughgoing statues, from the famous 1950 responsum that allowed driving to the synagogue on the Sabbath and up to the 2000 decision to ban rabbis from inquiring about whether someone was a [[Mamzer|Bastard]], de facto abolishing this legal category.<ref>Diana Villa, ''[http://www.bmj.org.il/userfiles/akdamot/27/vila.pdf \u05ea\u05d4\u05dc\u05d9\u05db\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e4\u05e1\u05d9\u05e7\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05e1\u05e8\u05d1\u05d8\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5]'', Akdamot 27, 2012.</ref>\n\n===Rulings and policies===\n[[File:Kotel masorti.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|A mixed-gender, egalitarian Conservative service at [[Robinson's Arch]], [[Western Wall]]]]\nThe RA and CJLS reached many decisions through the years, shaping a distinctive profile for Conservative practice and worship. In the 1940s, when the public demanded mixed seating of both sexes in synagogue, some rabbis argued there was no precedent but obliged on the ground of dire need ([[It is time to work for the Lord|Eth la'asot]]); others noted that archaeological research showed no partitions in ancient synagogues. Mixed seating became commonplace in almost all congregations. In 1950, it was ruled that using electricity (that is, closure of an [[electrical circuit]]) did not constitute [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat#Igniting a fire|kindling a fire]] unto itself, not even in [[incandescent bulb]]s, and therefore was not a forbidden labour and could be done on the Sabbath. On that basis, while performing banned labours is of course forbidden \u2013 for example, video recording is still constituted as writing \u2013 switching lights and other functions are allowed, though the RA strongly urges adherents to keep the sanctity of the Sabbath (refraining from doing anything that may imitate the atmosphere of weekdays, like loud noise reminiscent of work).\n\nThe need to encourage arrival at synagogue also motivated the CJLS, during the same year, to issue a temporal statue allowing driving on that day, for that purpose alone; it was supported by decreeing that the combustion of fuel did not serve any of the acts prohibited during the construction of the [[Tabernacle]], and could therefore be classified, according to their interpretation of the [[Tosafists]]' opinion, as \"redundant labour\" (''Sh\u2019eina Tzricha L\u2019gufa'') and be permitted. The validity of this argument was heavily disputed within the denomination. In 1952, [[Kohen|members of the priestly caste]] were allowed to marry divorcees, conditioned on forfeiture of their privileges, as termination of marriage became widespread and women who underwent it could not be suspected of unsavory acts. In 1967, the ban on priests marrying converts was also lifted.\n\nIn 1954, the issue of ''[[agunot]]'' (women refused divorce by their husbands) was largely settled by adding a clause to the [[Ketubah|prenuptial contract]] under which men had to pay alimony as long as they did not concede. In 1968, this mechanism was replaced by a retroactive expropriation of the [[bride price]], rendering the marriage void. In 1955, more girls were celebrating [[Bat Mitzvah]] and demanded to be allowed ascents to the Torah, the CJLS agreed that the ordinance under which women were banned from this due to respect for the congregation (''Kvod ha'Tzibur'') was no longer relevant. In 1972 it was decreed that [[rennet]], even if derived from unclean animals, was so transformed that it constituted a wholly new item (''Panim Chadashot ba'u l'Khan'') and therefore all [[hard cheese]] could be considered [[kosher]].\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of women's rights on the main agenda. Growing pressure led the CJLS to adopt a motion that females may be counted as part of a quorum, based on the argument that only the ''Shulchan Aruch'' explicitly stated that it consist of men. While accepted, this was very controversial in the Committee and heavily disputed. A more complete solution was offered in 1983 by Rabbi [[Joel Roth]], and was also enacted to allow women rabbinic ordination. Roth noted that some decisors of old acknowledged that women may bless when performing positive time-bound commandments (from which they are exempted, and therefore unable to fulfill the obligation for others), especially citing the manner in which they assumed upon themselves the [[Counting of the Omer]]. He suggested that women voluntarily commit to pray thrice a day et cetera, and his responsa was adopted. Since then, female rabbis were ordained at JTS and other seminaries. In 1994, the movement accepted [[Judith Hauptman]]'s principally egalitarian argument, according to which equal prayer obligations for women were never banned explicitly and it was only their inferior status that hindered participation. In 2006, openly gay rabbinic candidates were also to be admitted into the JTS. In 2012, a commitment ceremony for same-sex couples was devised, though not defined as ''[[Erusin|kiddushin]]''. In 2016, the rabbis passed a resolution supporting transgender rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/06/01/the-rabbis-of-conservative-judaism-pass-a-resolution-supporting-transgender-rights/|title=The rabbis of Conservative Judaism pass a resolution supporting transgender rights|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-06-02}}</ref>\n\nConservative Judaism in the United States held a relatively strict policy regarding intermarriage. Propositions for acknowledging Jews by patrilineal descent, as in the Reform movement, were overwhelmingly dismissed. Unconverted spouses were largely barred from community membership and participation in rituals; clergy are banned from any involvement in interfaith marriage on pain of dismissal. However, as the rate of such unions rose dramatically, Conservative congregations began describing gentile family members as ''K'rov Yisrael'' (Kin of Israel) and be more open toward them. The Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism stated in 1995: \"we want to encourage the Jewish partner to maintain his/her Jewish identity, and raise their children as Jews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mishkantefila.com/Intermarriage.html|title=LEADERSHIP COUNCIL OF CONSERVATIVE JUDAISM, Statement on Intermarriage, Adopted March 7, 1995|publisher=|access-date=May 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406140247/http://www.mishkantefila.com/Intermarriage.html|archive-date=April 6, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Organization and demographics==\nThe term ''Conservative Judaism'' was used, still generically and not yet as a specific label, already in the 1887 dedication speech of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] by Rabbi [[Alexander Kohut]]. By 1901, the JTS alumni formed the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], of which all ordained Conservative clergy in the world are members. As of 2010, there were 1,648 rabbis in the RA. In 1913, the [[United Synagogue of America]], renamed the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism in 1991, was founded as a congregational arm of the RA. The movement established the World Council of Conservative Synagogues in 1957. Offshoots outside North America mostly adopted the Hebrew name \"Masorti\", traditional', as did the Israeli Masorti Movement, founded in 1979, and the British Assembly of Masorti Synagogues, formed in 1985. The World Council eventually changed its name to \"Masorti Olami\", Masorti International. Besides the RA, the international [[Cantors Assembly]] supplies prayer leaders for congregations worldwide.\n\nThe United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, covering the United States and Canada, is by far the largest constituent of Masorti Olami. While most congregations defining themselves as \"Conservative\" are affiliated with the USCJ, some are independent. While accurate information of Canada is scant, it is estimated that some third of religiously affiliated Canadian Jews are Conservative.<ref>Arnold Dashefsky, Ira Sheskin, ''American Jewish Year, Book 2012'', Springer Science & Business Media, 2012. p. 75.</ref> In 2008, the more traditional Canadian Council of Conservative Synagogues seceded from the parent organization. It numbered seven communities as of 2014. According to the [[Pew Research Center]] survey in 2013, 18 per cent of Jews in the United States identified with the movement, making it the second largest denomination in the country. [[Steven M. Cohen]] calculated that 962,000 U.S. Jewish adults considered themselves Conservative: 570,000 were registered congregants and further 392,000 were not members in a synagogue but identified. In addition, Cohen assumed in 2006 that 57,000 unconverted non-Jewish spouses were also registered (12 per cent of member households had one at the time): 40 per cent of members intermarry. Conservatives are also the most aged group: among those aged under 30 only 11 per cent identified as such, and there are three people over 55 for every single one aged between 35 and 44. As of November 2015, the USCJ had 580 member congregations (a sharp decline from 630 two years prior), 19 in Canada and the remainder in the United States.<ref>Steven M.

The British Assembly of Masorti Synagogues has 13 communities and estimates its membership at over 4,000. More than 20 communities are spread across Europe, and there are 3 in Australia and 2 in Africa. The Masorti Movement in Israel incorporates some 70 communities and prayer groups with several thousand full members. In addition, while Hungarian [[Neolog Judaism]], with a few thousands of adherents and forty partially active synagogues, is not officially affiliated with Masorti Olami, Conservative Judaism regards it as a fraternal, \"non-Orthodox but halakhic\" movement.<ref>Elazar, Geffen.

Their communal corporate rights were abolished, and the process of [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] and [[acculturation]] that followed quickly transformed the values and norms of the public. Estrangement and apathy toward Judaism were rampant. The process of communal, educational and civil reform could not be restricted from affecting the core tenets of the faith. The new academic, critical study of Judaism (''[[Wissenschaft des Judentums]]'') soon became a source of controversy. Rabbis and scholars argued to what degree, if at all, its findings could be used to determine present conduct. The [[Torah im Derech Eretz|modernized Orthodox]] in Germany, like rabbis [[Isaac Bernays]] and [[Azriel Hildesheimer]], were content to cautiously study it while stringently adhering to the sanctity of holy texts and refusing to grant ''Wissenschaft'' any say in religious matters. On the other extreme were Rabbi [[Abraham Geiger]], who would emerge as the founding father of [[Reform Judaism]], and his supporters. They opposed any limit on critical research or its practical application, laying more weight on the need for change than on continuity.\n\n[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia e15 334-0.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rabbi Zecharias Frankel]]\nThe [[Prague]]-born Rabbi [[Zecharias Frankel]], appointed chief rabbi of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] in 1836, gradually rose to become the leader of those who stood at the middle. Besides working for the civic betterment of local Jews and educational reform, he displayed keen interest in ''Wissenschaft''. But Frankel was always cautious and deeply reverent towards tradition, privately writing in 1836 that \"the means must be applied with such care and discretion... that forward progress will be reached unnoticed, and seem inconsequential to the average spectator.\" He soon found himself embroiled in the great disputes of the 1840s. In 1842, during the second [[Hamburg Temple controversy]], he opposed the new Reform prayerbook, arguing the elimination of petitions for a future Return to Zion led by the Messiah was a violation of an ancient tenet. But he also opposed the ban placed on the tome by Rabbi Bernays, stating this was a primitive behaviour. In the same year, he and [[S.L. Rapoport]] were the only ones of nineteen respondents who negatively answered the [[Breslau]] community's enquiry on whether the deeply unorthodox Geiger could serve there. In 1843, Frankel clashed with the radical Reform rabbi [[Samuel Holdheim]], who argued that the act of [[marriage in Judaism]] was a civic (''memonot'') rather than sanctified (''issurim'') matter and could be subject to the Law of the Land. In December 1843 Frankel launched the magazine ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Religi\u00f6sen Interessen des Judenthums''. In the preamble, he attempted to present his approach to the present plight: \"the further development of Judaism cannot be done through Reform that would lead to total dissipation... But must be involved in its study... pursued via scientific research, on a ''positive, historical'' basis.\" The term Positive-Historical became associated with him and his middle way. The ''Zeitschrift'' was, along the convictions of its publisher, neither dogmatically orthodox nor overly polemic, wholly opposing [[Biblical criticism]] and arguing for the antiquity of custom and practice.\n\nIn 1844, Geiger and like-minded allies arranged a conference in [[Braunschweig]] that was to have enough authority (since 1826, Rabbi [[Aaron Chorin]] called for the convocation of a new ''[[Sanhedrin]]'') to debate and enact thoroughgoing revisions. Frankel was willing to agree only to a meeting without any practical results, and refused the invitation. When the protocols, which contained many radical statements, were published, he denounced the assembly for \"applying the scalpel of criticism\" and favouring the spirit of the age over tradition. However, he later agreed to attend the second conference, held in [[Frankfurt am Main]] on 15 July 1845&nbsp;\u2013 in spite of warnings from Rapoport, who cautioned that compromise with Geiger was impossible and he would only damage his reputation among the traditionalists. On the 16th, the issue of Hebrew in the liturgy arose. Most present were inclined to retain it, but with more German segments. A small majority adopted a resolution stating there were subjective, but no objective, imperatives to keep it as the language of service. Frankel then astounded his peers by vehemently protesting, stating it was a breach with the past and Hebrew was of dire importance and great sentimental value. The others immediately began quoting all passages in rabbinic literature allowing prayer in the vernacular. Frankel could not contend with the ''halakhic'' validity of their decision as he perceived it as a sign of profound differences between them. On the 17th he formally withdrew, publishing a lambasting critique of the procedures. \"Opponents of the conference, who feared he went to the other side,\" noted historian Michael A. Meyer, \"now felt reassured of his loyalty\".\n\n[[File:Posithis.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Frankel's speech in the protocol of the Frankfurt conference, mentioning \"Positive-Historical Judaism\" (second row, 2-4 words from left)]]\nThe rabbi of Saxony had many sympathizers, who supported a similarly moderate approach and change only on the basis of the authority of the Talmud. When Geiger began preparing a third conference in Breslau, [[Hirsch B\u00e4r Fassel]] convinced Frankel to organize one of his own in protest. He invited colleagues to an assembly in [[Dresden]], which was to be held on 21 October 1846. He announced that one measure he was willing to countenance was the possible abolition of the [[second day of festivals]], though only based on a broad consensus and much deliberation. Attendants were to include Rapoport, Fassel, [[Adolf Jellinek]], [[Leopold L\u00f6w]], [[Michael Sachs]], [[Abraham Kohn]] and others. However, the Dresden assembly soon drew heated Orthodox resistance, especially from Rabbi [[Jacob Ettlinger]], and was postponed indefinitely.\n\nIn 1854, Frankel was appointed Chancellor in the new [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]], the first modern rabbinical seminary in Germany. His opponents on both flanks were incensed. Geiger and the Reform camp long accused him of theological ambiguity, hypocrisy and attachment to stagnant remnants, and now protested the \"medieval\" atmosphere in the seminary, which was mainly concerned with teaching Jewish Law. The hardline Orthodox [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], who fiercely opposed ''Wissenschaft'' and emphasized the divine origin of the entire ''halakhic'' system in the Theophany at Sinai, was deeply suspicious of his beliefs, use of science and constant assertions the Law was flexible and evolving.\n\nThe final schism between Frankel and the Orthodox occurred after the 1859 publication of his ''Darke ha-Mishna'' (Ways of the [[Mishna]]). He heaved praise on the [[Chazal|Beatified Sages]], presenting them as bold innovators, but not once affirmed the divinity of the [[Oral Torah]]. On the ordinances classified as [[Law given to Moses at Sinai]], he quoted [[Asher ben Jehiel]] that stated several of those were only apocryphally dubbed as such; he applied the latter's conclusion to all, noting they were \"so evident ''as if'' given at Sinai\". Hirsch branded him a heretic, demanding he announce whether he believed that both the Oral and Written Torah were of celestial origin. Rabbis [[Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach]], [[Solomon Klein]] and others published more complaisant tracts, but also requested an explanation. Rapoport marshaled to Frankel's aid, assuring that his words were merely reiterating ben Jehiel's and that he would soon release a statement that would belie Hirsch's accusations. But then the Chancellor of Breslau issued an ambiguous defence, writing his book was not concerned with theology and avoiding giving any clear answer. Now even Rapoport joined his critics.\n\n[[File:Breslauseminar.png|thumb|left|[[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]]]]\nHirsch succeeded, severely tarnishing his rival's reputation among most concerned. Along with fellow Orthodox Rabbi [[Azriel Hildesheimer]], he launched a protracted public campaign through the 1860s. They ceaselessly stressed the chasm between an Orthodox understanding of ''halakha'' as derived and revealed, applied differently to different circumstances and subject to human judgement and possibly error, yet unchanging and divine in principle \u2013 as opposed to an evolutionary, historicist and non-dogmatic approach in which past authorities were not just elaborating but consciously innovating, as taught by Frankel. Hildesheimer often repeated that this issue utterly overshadowed any specific technical argument with the Breslau School (the students of which were often more lenient on matters of headcovering for women, [[Chalav Yisrael]] and other issues). He was concerned that Jewish public opinion perceived no practical difference between them; though he cared to distinguish the observant acolytes of Frankel from the Reform camp, he noted in his diary: \"how meager is the principal difference between the Breslau School, who don silk gloves at their work, and Geiger who wields a sledgehammer.\" In 1863, when Breslau faculty member [[Heinrich Graetz]] published an article where he appeared to doubt the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messianic belief]], Hildesheimer immediately seized upon the occasion to prove once more the dogmatic, rather than practical, divide. He denounced Graetz as a heretic.   \n\nThe Positive-Historical School was influential, but never institutionalized itself as thoroughly as its opponents. Apart from the many graduates of Breslau, [[Isaac Noah Mannheimer]], [[Adolf Jellinek]] and Rabbi [[Moritz G\u00fcdemann]] led the central congregation in [[Vienna]] along a similar path. In Jellinek's local seminary, [[Meir Friedmann]] and [[Isaac Hirsch Weiss]] followed Frankel's moderate approach to critical research. The rabbinate of the liberal [[Neolog Judaism|Neolog public]] in Hungary, which formally separated from the Orthodox, was also permeated with the \"Breslsu spirit\". Many of its members studied there, and its [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Budapest]] was modeled after it, though the assimilationist congregants cared little for rabbinic opinion. In Germany itself, Breslau alumni founded in 1868 a short-lived society, the J\u00fcdisch-Theologische Verein. It was dissolved within a year, boycotted by both Reform and Orthodox. [[Michael Sachs]] led the Berlin congregation in a very conservative style, eventually resigning when an organ was introduced in services. [[Manuel Jo\u00ebl]], another of the Frankelist party, succeeded Geiger in Breslau. He maintained his predecessor's truncated German translation of the liturgy for the sake of compromise, but returned the full Hebrew text.\n\nThe Breslau Seminary and the Reform [[Hochschule f\u00fcr die Wissenschaft des Judentums]] maintained very different approaches; but on the communal level, the former's alumni failure to organize or articulate a coherent agenda, coupled with the declining prestige of Breslau and the conservatism of the Hochschule's alumni \u2013 a necessity in heterogeneous communities which remained unified, especially after the Orthodox gained the right to secede in 1876 \u2013 imposed a rather uniform and mild character on what was known in Germany as \"Liberal Judaism\". In 1909, 63 rabbis associated with Breslau approach founded the Freie j\u00fcdische Vereinigung, another brief attempt at institutionalization, but it too failed soon. Only in 1925 did the Religi\u00f6se Mittelpartei f\u00fcr Frieden und Einheit succeed in driving the same agenda. It won several seats in communal elections, but was small and of little influence.\n\n===Jewish Theological Seminary===\n[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|thumb|The [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], the main rabbinical seminary of Conservative Judaism]]\nJewish immigration to the United States bred an amalgam of loose communities, lacking strong tradition or stable structures. In this free-spirited environment, a multitude of forces was at work. As early as 1866, Rabbi Jonas Bondi of New York wrote that a Judaism of the \"golden middleway, which was termed Orthodox by the left and heterodox or reformer by the right\" developed in the new country. The rapid ascendancy of [[Reform Judaism]] by the 1880s left few who opposed it: merely a handful of congregations and ministers remained outside the [[Union of American Hebrew Congregations]]. These included [[Sabato Morais]] and Rabbi [[Henry Pereira Mendes]] of the elitist [[Sephardi]] congregations, along with rabbis [[Bernard Drachman]] (ordained at Breslau, though he regarded himself as Orthodox) and Henry Schneeberger.\n\nWhile spearheaded by radical and principled Reformers like Rabbi [[Kaufmann Kohler]], the UAHC was also home to more conservative elements. President [[Isaac Meyer Wise]], a pragmatist intent on compromise, hoped to forge a broad consensus that would turn a moderate version of Reform to dominant in America. He kept the [[kosher|dietary laws]] at home and attempted to assuage traditionalists. On 11 July 1883, apparently due to negligence by the Jewish caterer, non-kosher dishes were served to UAHC rabbis in Wise's presence. Known to posterity as the \"[[trefa banquet]]\", it purportedly made some guests abandon the hall in disgust, but little is factually known about the incident. In 1885, the traditionalist forces were bolstered upon the arrival of Rabbi [[Alexander Kohut]], an adherent of Frankel. He publicly excoriated Reform for disdaining ritual and received forms, triggering a heated polemic with Kohler. The debate was one of the main factors which motivated the latter to compose the [[Pittsburgh Platform]], which unambiguously declared the principles of Reform Judaism: \"to-day we accept as binding only the moral laws, and maintain only such ceremonies as elevate and sanctify our lives.\"\n\nThe explicit wording alienated a handful of conservative UAHC ministers: Henry Hochheimer, [[Frederick de Sola Mendes]], [[Aaron Wise]], [[Marcus Jastrow]], and [[Benjamin Szold]]. They joined Kohut, Morais and the others in seeking to establish a traditional rabbinic seminary that would serve as a counterweight to [[Hebrew Union College]]. In 1886, they founded the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City. Kohut, professor of Talmud who held to the Positive-Historical ideal, was the main educational influence in the early years, prominent among the founders who encompassed the entire spectrum from progressive Orthodox to the brink of Reform; to describe what the seminary intended to espouse, he used the term \"Conservative Judaism\", which had no independent meaning at the time and was only in relation to Reform. In 1898, Pereira Mendes, Schneeberger and Drachman also founded the [[Orthodox Union]], which maintained close ties with the seminary.\n\nThe JTS was a small, fledgling institution with financial difficulties, and was ordaining merely a rabbi per year. But soon after Chancellor Morais' death in 1897, its fortunes turned. Since 1881, a wave of Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe was inundating the country \u2013 by 1920, 2.5 million of them had arrived, increasing American Jewry tenfold. They came from regions where civil equality or emancipation were never granted, while acculturation and modernization made little headway. Whether devout or irreligious, they mostly retained strong traditional sentiments in matters of faith, accustomed to old-style rabbinate; the hardline [[Agudas HaRabbanim]], founded by emigrant clergy, opposed secular education or vernacular sermons, and its members spoke almost only [[Yiddish]]. The Eastern Europeans were alienated by the local Jews, who were all assimilated in comparison, and especially aghast by the mores of Reform. The need to find a religious framework that would both accommodate and Americanize them motivated [[Jacob Schiff]] and other rich philanthropists, all Reform and of German descent, to donate $500,000 to the JTS. The contribution was solicited by Professor [[Cyrus Adler]]. It was conditioned on the appointment of [[Solomon Schechter]] as Chancellor. In 1901, the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] was established as the fraternity of JTS alumni.\n\n[[File:SolomonSchechter3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Solomon Schechter]]]]\nSchechter arrived in 1902, and at once reorganized the faculty, dismissing both Pereira Mendes and Drachman for lack of academic merit. Under his aegis, the institute began to draw famous scholars, becoming a center of learning on par with HUC. Schechter was both traditional in sentiment and quite unorthodox in conviction. He maintained that theology was of little importance and it was practice that must be preserved. He aspired to solicit unity in American Judaism, denouncing sectarianism and not perceiving himself as leading a new denomination: \"not to create a new party, but to consolidate an old one\". The need to raise funds convinced him that a congregational arm for the Rabbinical Assembly and the JTS was required. On 23 February 1913, he founded the United Synagogue of America (since 1991: United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism), which then consisted of 22 communities. He and Mendes first came to major disagreement; Schechter insisted that any alumnus could be appointed to the USoA's managerial board, and not just to serve as communal rabbi, including several the latter did not consider sufficiently devout, or who tolerated mixed seating in their synagogues (though some of those he still regarded as Orthodox). Mendes, president of the Orthodox Union, therefore refused to join. He began to distinguish between the \"Modern Orthodoxy\" of himself and his peers in the OU, and \"Conservatives\" who tolerated what was beyond the pale for him. However, this first sign of institutionalization and separation was far from conclusive. Mendes himself could not clearly differentiate between the two groups, and many he viewed as Orthodox were members of the USoA. The epithets \"Conservative\" and \"Orthodox\" remained interchangeable for decades to come. JTS graduates served in OU congregations; many students of the Orthodox [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] and members of the OU's [[Rabbinical Council of America]], or RCA, attended it. In 1926, RIETS and the JTS even negotiated a possible merger, though it was never materialized. Upon Schechter's death in 1915, the first generation of his disciples kept his non-sectarian legacy of striving for a united, traditional American Judaism. He was replaced by Cyrus Adler.<ref>Cohen, ''The Birth of Conservative Judaism'', pp. 80\u201382.</ref>\nThe USoA grew rapidly as the Eastern European immigrant population slowly integrated. In 1923 it already had 150 affiliated communities, and 229 before 1930. Synagogues offered a more modernized ritual: English sermons, choir singing, late Friday evening services which tacitly acknowledging that most had to work until after the Sabbath began, and often mixed-gender seating. Men and women sat separately with no partition, and some houses of prayer already introduced family pews. Motivated by popular pressure and frowned upon by both RA and seminary faculty \u2013 in its own synagogue, the institute maintained a partition until 1983 \u2013 this was becoming common among the OU as well. As both social conditions and apathy turned American Jews away from tradition (barely 20 per cent were attending prayers weekly), a young professor named [[Mordecai Kaplan]] promoted the idea of transforming the synagogue into a community center, a \"Shul with a Pool\", a policy which indeed stymied the tide somewhat.<ref>[[Jack Wertheimer]], ''[http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=3040 The Conservative Synagogue]'', Cambridge University Press, 1987.</ref>\n\n[[File:East Midwood Jewish Center building 1.JPG|thumb|left|[[East Midwood Jewish Center]], a United Synagogue affiliate built in 1926, during the early years of the union]]\nIn 1927, the RA also established its own Committee of Jewish Law, entrusted with determining ''halakhic'' issues. Consisting of seven members, it was chaired by the traditionalist Rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]], who already distinguished himself in 1922, drafting a responsa that allowed to use grape juice rather than fermented wine for ''[[Kiddush]]'' on the background of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. Kaplan himself, who rose to become an influential and popular figure within the JTS, concluded that his fellow rabbis' ambiguity in matters of belief and the contradiction between full observance and critical study were untenable and hypocritical. He formulated his own approach of [[Judaism as a Civilization]], rejecting the concept of [[Revelation]] and any supernatural belief in favour of a cultural-ethnic perception. While valuing received mores, he eventually suggested giving the past \"a vote, not a veto\". Though popular among students, Kaplan's nascent [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionism]] was opposed by the new traditionalist Chancellor [[Louis Finkelstein]], appointed in 1940, and a large majority among the faculty.\n\nTensions within the JTS and RA grew. The Committee of Jewish Law consisted mainly of scholars who had little field experience, almost solely from the seminary's Talmudic department. They were greatly concerned with ''halakhic'' licitness and indifferent to the pressures exerted on the pulpit rabbis, who had to contend with an Americanized public which cared little for such considerations or for tradition in general. In 1935, the RA almost adopted a groundbreaking motion: Rabbi Louis Epstein offered a solution to the [[agunah]] predicament, a clause that would have had husbands appoint wives as their proxies to issue divorce. It was repealed under pressure from the Orthodox Union. As late as 1947, CJL Chair Rabbi [[Boaz Cohen]], himself a historicist who argued that the Law evolved much through time, rebuked pulpit clergy who requested lenient or radical rulings, stating he and his peers were content to \"progress in inches... Free setting up of new premises and the introduction of novel categories of ritual upon the basis of pure reason and thinking would be perilous, if not fatal, to the principles and continuity of Jewish Law.\"\n\n===A third movement===\nThe boundaries between Orthodox and Conservative Judaism in America were institutionalized only in the aftermath of World War II. The 1940s saw the younger generation of JTS graduates less patient with the prudence of the CJL and Talmud faculty in face of popular demand. Kaplan's Reconstructionism, while its fully committed partisans were few, had much influence. The majority among recent alumni eschewed the epithet \"Orthodox\" and tended to employ \"Conservative\" exclusively. Succeeding Schechter's direct disciples who headed the RA, JTS and United Synagogue in the interwar period, a new strata of activist leaders was rising. Rabbi [[Robert Gordis]], RA president in 1944\u20131946, represented the junior members in advocating more flexibility; Rabbi [[Jacob Agus]], a RIETS graduate who joined the body only in 1945, clamored that \"we need a law making body, not a law interpreting committee.\" Agus argued that the breach between the Jewish public and tradition was too wide to be bridged conventionally, and that the RA would always remain inferior to the Orthodox as long as it retained its policy of merely adopting lenient precedents in rabbinic literature. He offered to extensively apply the tool of ''[[takkanah]]'', rabbinic ordinance.\n\n[[File:Shaarey Zadek.jpg|thumb|The Conservative [[Congregation Shaarey Zedek]], [[Southfield, Michigan]], whose synagogue was built in 1962, after the migration to suburbia]]\nIn 1946, a committee chaired by Gordis issued the ''Sabbath and Festival Prayerbook'', the first clearly Conservative liturgy: references to the sacrificial cult were in the past tense instead of a petition for restoration, and it rephrased blessings such as \"who hast made me according to thy will\" for women to \"who hast made me a woman\". During the movement's national conference in [[Chicago]], held 13\u201317 May 1948, the pulpit rabbis in the RA gained the upper hand. Spurned by Gordis, Agus and fellow leaders, They voted to reorganize the CJL into a Committee of Jewish Law and Standards, enfranchised to issue ''takkanot'' by a majority. Membership was conditioned on having experience as a congregational rabbi, and unseasoned JTS faculty were thus denied entrance. While the RA was asserting a Conservative distinctive identity, the seminary remained more cautious. Finkelstein opposed sectarianism and preferred the neutral epithet \"traditional\", later commenting that \"Conservative Judaism is a gimmick to get Jews back to real Judaism\". He and the very right-wing Talmud professor [[Saul Lieberman]], who maintained ties with the Orthodox while also viewing them as obstructionist and ossified, dominated the JTS, providing a counterweight to the liberals in the Assembly. Kaplan, meanwhile, spent more time on consolidating his Society for Advancement of Judaism. [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], who espoused a [[Jewish mysticism|mysticist understanding of Jewish religion]], also became an important figure among the faculty.\n[[File:Heschel.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Rabbi [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] in 1964]]\n\nThe CJLS now proceeded to demonstrate its independence. Sabbath was widely desecrated by a large majority of Jews, and the board believed arrival at synagogues should be encouraged. They therefore enacted an ordinance that allowed driving on the Sabbath (for worship alone) and the use of electricity. The driving responsum was later severely criticized by Conservative rabbis, and was charged with imparting the movement was overly keen to condone the laxity of congregants. It also signified the final break with the Orthodox, who were themselves being bolstered by more strictly observant immigrants from Europe. In 1954, the RCA reverted its 1948 ruling that allowed the use of microphones on Sabbath and festivals and declared that praying without a partition between sexes was banned. Though enforced slowly&nbsp;\u2014 in 1997, there were still seven OU congregations with no physical barrier, and so-called \"[[Conservadox]]\" remain extant&nbsp;\u2014 these two attributes became a demarcation line between Orthodox and Conservative synagogues. RA converts were denied ablution in Orthodox ritual baths, and rabbis from one denomination would gradually cease serving in the other's communities.\n\nRather than a force within American Judaism, the JTS-centered movement emerged as a third denomination. The historicist and critical approach to ''halakha'', as well as other features, were emphasized by leaders eager to demonstrate their uniqueness. In their efforts to solidify a coherent identity, Conservative thinkers like [[Mordecai Waxman]] in his 1957 ''Tradition and Change'', ventured beyond Schechter's deem conceptions to Rabbi Zecharias Frankel and Breslau, presenting themselves as its direct inheritors via [[Alexander Kohut]] and others. The CJLS continued to issue groundbreaking ordinances and rulings.\n\nThe postwar decades were a time of immense growth for the Conservative movement. Most of the 500,000 decommissioned Jewish GI's left the densely populated immigrant neighbourhoods of the East Coast, moving to [[suburbia]]. They were Americanized but still retained traditional sentiments, and Reform Judaism was too radical for most. The United Synagogue of America offered Jewish education for children and a familiar religious environment which was also comfortable and not strict. It expanded from 350 communities by 1945 to 832 by 1971, becoming the largest denomination, with some 350,000 member households (1.5 million people) at synagogues and over 40 per cent of American Jewry identifying with it in polls, adding an estimated million more non-registered supporters.\n\nAlready in a 1955 study, [[Marshall Sklare]] defined Conservative Judaism as the quintessential American Jewish movement, but recognized the gap between laity and clergy, noting \"rabbis now recognize that they are not making decisions or writing responsa, but merely taking a poll of their membership.\" Most congregants, commented [[Edward S. Shapiro]], were \"Conservative Jews because their rabbi kept kosher and the Sabbath... Not because of their religious behavior.\" The movement established its presence outside the U.S. and Canada: In 1962, the young Rabbi [[Marshall Meyer]] founded the [[Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano]] in [[Buenos Aires]], which would serve as the basis for Conservative expansion in South America. In 1979, four communities formed the Israel Masorti Movement. Rabbi [[Louis Jacobs]], dismissed in 1964 from the British Orthodox rabbinate on the charge of heresy after espousing a non-literal understanding of the Torah, joined with the Conservatives and founded his country's first Masorti community. The new branches were all united within the World Council of Synagogues, later to be named Masorti Olami.\n\nThe denomination peaked in numbers in the 1970s. During that decade, the tensions between the various elements within it intensified. The right wing, conservative in ''halakhic'' matters and often adhering to a verbal understanding of revelation, was dismayed by the failure to bolster observance among the laity and the resurgence of Orthodoxy. The left was influenced by the Reconstructionists, who formed [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College|their own seminary]] in 1968 and were slowly coalescing, as well as the growing appeal of Reform, which turned more traditional and threatened to sway congregants. While the rightists opposed further modifications, their peers demanded them. The [[Chavurah]] movement, consisting of nonaligned prayer quorums of young (and frequently, Conservative-raised) worshipers who sought a more intense religious experience, also weakened congregations. In 1972, the liberal wing gained an influential position with the appointment of Gerson D. Cohen as JTS Chancellor. During the same year, after Reform began to ordain female rabbis, a strong lobby rose to advocate the same. The CJLS rapidly enacted an ordinance which allowed women to be tallied for a ''[[minyan]]'', and by 1976 the percentage of synagogues allowing them to bless during the reading of the Torah grew from 7 per cent to 50 per cent. In 1979, ignoring the denominational leadership, [[Beth Israel Congregation of Chester County]] accepted the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College|RRC]]-ordained Rabbi [[Linda Joy Holtzman]]. Pressures to allow women to assume rabbinical positions was mounting from the congregational level, though the RA agreed to delay any action until the JTS scholars would concur.\n\nFemale ordination was a matter of great friction until 1983, when Rabbi [[Joel Roth]] devised a solution that entailed women voluntarily accepting the obligation to pray regularly. The leadership passed it not by scholarly consensus but via a popular vote of all JTS faculty, including non-specialists. Two years later, the first JTS-ordained female rabbi, [[Amy Eilberg]], was admitted into the RA. [[David Weiss Halivni]], professor of the Talmud faculty, claimed that Roth's method must have required waiting until a considerable number of women did prove sufficient commitment. He and his sympathizers regarded the vote as belying any claim to ''halakhic'' integrity. They formed the [[Union for Traditional Judaism|Union for Traditional Conservative Judaism]] in 1985, a right-wing lobby which numbered some 10,000 supporters from the Conservative observant elite. The UTJC withdrew from the denomination and erased the word \"Conservative\" in 1990, attempting to merge with moderate Orthodox organizations.\n\nIn the very same year, the Reconstructionist also seceded fully, joining the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]] under observer status. The double defection narrowed the movement's spectrum of opinions, at a time when large swaths of congregants were abandoning in favour of Reform, which was more tolerant of intermarriage. RA leaders were engaged in introspection through the later 1980s, resulting in the 1988 ''Emet ve-Emunah'' platform, while Reform slowly bypassed them and became the largest denomination.\n\nAfter the issue of egalitarianism for women subsided, LGBT acceptance replaced it as the main source of contention between the declining right-wing wing and the liberal majority. A first attempt was rebuffed in 1992 by a harsh responsum written by Roth. The retirement of Chancellor [[Ismar Schorsch]], a staunch opponent, allowed the CJLS to endorse a motion which still banned anal intercourse but not any other physical contact, and allowed the ordination of openly LGBT rabbis, in 2006. Roth and three other supporters resigned from the panel in protest, claiming the responsum was not valid; Masorti affiliates in South America, Israel and Hungary objected severely. The Seminario is yet to accept the resolution, while several Canadian congregations seceded from the United Synagogue in 2008 to form an independent union in protest of the slide to the left. Since the 2013 Pew survey, which assessed that only 18 per cent of American Jews identify with it, Conservative leadership is engaged in attempting to solve the denomination's demographic crisis.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Conservative Judaism: An American Religious Movement''.
