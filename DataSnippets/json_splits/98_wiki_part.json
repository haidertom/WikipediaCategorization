From 1898 to 1922, the competition was organised into regional groups. Because of ever growing teams attending regional championships, the [[Italian Football Federation]] (FIGC) split the CCI (Italian Football Confederation) in 1921. When CCI teams rejoined the FIGC created two interregional divisions renaming Categories into Divisions and splitting FIGC sections into two North-South leagues. In 1926, due to internal crises, the FIGC changed internal settings, adding southern teams to the national division, ultimately leading to the 1929\u201330 final settlement. No title was awarded in 1927 after [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] were stripped of the championship by the FIGC. Torino were declared champions in the [[1948\u201349 Serie A|1948\u201349 season]] following [[Superga air disaster|a plane crash]] near the end of the season in which the entire team was killed.\n\nThe Serie A Championship title is often referred to as the ''scudetto'' (\"small shield\") because since the 1924\u201325 season, the winning team will bear a small coat of arms with the [[flag of Italy|Italian tricolour]] on their strip in the following season. The [[Football records in Italy#Most successful clubs overall (1898\u2013present)|most successful club]] is [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] with 34 championships, followed by both [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]], with 18 championships apiece. From the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305 season]] onwards, an actual trophy was awarded to club on the pitch after the last turn of the championship. The trophy, called the [[Coppa Campioni d'Italia]], has officially been used since the [[1960\u201361 Serie A|1960\u201361 season]], but between 1961 and 2004 was consigned to the winning clubs at the head office of the [[Lega Nazionale Professionisti]].\n\nIn April 2009, Serie A announced a split from Serie B. Nineteen of the twenty clubs voted in favour of the move in an argument over television rights; the relegation-threatened [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] had voted against the decision. Maurizio Beretta, the former head of Italy's employers' association, became president of the new league.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8027857.stm |title=Serie A to form breakaway league - BBC Sport |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/165281-serie-a-clubs-to-set-up-their-own-league |title=Serie A clubs to set up their own league |publisher=Bleacher Report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20141226012045/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/165281-serie-a-clubs-to-set-up-their-own-league |archivedate=2014-12-26 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"skysports\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11854_5260115,00.html |title=Serie A set for breakaway |publisher=SkySports |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/30/serie-a-b-european-football-italy |title=Italian league splits in two after meeting ends in stalemate |publisher=Guardian |date= 2009-04-30|accessdate=2010-10-03 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, it was announced that Serie A was selected by the [[International Football Association Board]] to test video replays, which were initially private for the [[2016\u201317 Serie A|2016\u201317 season]], allowing them to become a live pilot phase, with replay assistance implemented in the [[2017\u201318 Serie A|2017\u201318 season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/103940/serie-will-start-var|title=Serie A will start with VAR|publisher=Football Italia|date=10 June 2017|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> On the decision, FIGC President [[Carlo Tavecchio]] said, \"We were among the first supporters of using technology on the pitch and we believe we have everything required to offer our contribution to this important experiment.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/serie-selected-ifab-test-video-replay/|title=Serie A selected by IFAB to test video replay|publisher=sportsnet.ca|date=14 April 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nFor most of Serie A's history, there were 16 or 18 clubs competing at the top level. Since [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305]], however, there have been 20 clubs altogether. One season (1947\u201348) was played with 21 teams for political reasons. Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league's history;\n* 18 clubs: 1929\u20131934\n* 16 clubs: 1934\u20131943\n* 20 clubs: 1946\u20131947\n* 21 clubs: 1947\u20131948\n* 20 clubs: 1948\u20131952\n* 18 clubs: 1952\u20131967\n* 16 clubs: 1967\u20131988\n* 18 clubs: 1988\u20132004\n* 20 clubs: 2004\u2013present\n\n[[File:Scudetto.svg|thumb|upright=0.65|''[[Scudetto]]'' patch]]\nDuring the season, which runs from August to May, each club plays each of the other teams twice; once at home and once away, totalling 38 games for each team by the end of the season. Thus, in Italian football a true [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format is used. In the first half of the season, called the ''andata'', each team plays once against each league opponent, for a total of 19 games. In the second half of the season, called the ''ritorno'', the teams play in exactly the same order that they did in the first half of the season, the only difference being that home and away situations are switched. Since the 1994\u201395 season, teams are awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and no points for a loss.\n\nThe top four teams in the Serie A qualify straight to the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stages (from the 2017\u201318 season). Teams finishing fifth and sixth qualify for the [[UEFA Europa League]] tournament. A third UEFA Europa League spot is reserved for the winner of the [[Coppa Italia]]. If the Coppa Italia champion already qualified for European football by finishing among the top seven teams in Serie A, the seventh-ranked team in Serie A is awarded the UEFA Europa League spot. The three lowest-placed teams are [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] to [[Serie B]].\n\nFrom 2005\u201306 [[2005\u201306 Serie A|season]] if two or more teams are tied in points (for any place), the deciding tie-breakers are as follows:\n\n# Head-to-head records (results and points)\n# [[Goal difference]] of head-to-head games\n# Goal difference overall\n# Higher number of goals scored\n# Draw\n\nUntil 2004\u201305 [[2004\u201305 Serie A|season]], a playoff would be used to determine the champions, European spots or relegation, if the two teams were tied on points. Any play-off was held after the end of regular season. The last championship playoff occurred in the [[1963\u201364 Serie A|1963\u201364 season]] when Bologna and Inter both finished on 54 points. Bologna won the play-off 2\u20130.\n\n==Serie A clubs==\n{{further|List of Italian Football Championship clubs}}\nPrior to 1929, many clubs competed in the top level of Italian football as the earlier rounds were competed up to 1922 on a [[regional]] basis then interregional up to 1929.

A gas used as a propellant in [[whipped cream]] aerosol containers, nitrous oxide, is used as a recreational drug. Pressurized canisters of [[propane]] and [[butane]] gas, both of which are intended for use as fuels, are used as inhalants.\n\n====Medical anesthetics====\nSeveral medical anesthetics are used as recreational drugs, including [[diethyl ether]] (a drug that is no longer used medically, due to its high flammability and the development of safer alternatives) and [[nitrous oxide]], which is widely used in the 2010s by dentists as an [[anxiolytic|anti-anxiety drug]] during dental procedures. Diethyl ether has a long history of use as a recreational drug. The effects of ether intoxication are similar to those of [[ethanol|alcohol]] intoxication, but more potent. Also, due to NMDA antagonism, the user may experience all the psychedelic effects present in classical dissociatives such as [[ketamine]] in forms of thought loops and feeling of mind being disconnected from one's body. Nitrous oxide is a dental anesthetic which is used as a recreational drug, either by users who have access to medical-grade gas canisters (e.g., dental hygienists or dentists) or by using the gas contained in [[whipped cream]] aerosol containers. Nitrous oxide inhalation can cause [[Analgesic|pain relief]], [[depersonalisation]], [[derealisation]], [[dizziness]], [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], and some sound distortion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Giannini |first=A.

Solvents such as [[toluene]] and [[gasoline]] act as [[depressant]]s, causing users to feel relaxed and sleepy.

Other agents may have more direct effects at receptors, as inhalants exhibit a variety of mechanisms of action. The mechanisms of action of many non-medical inhalants have not been well elucidated. Anesthetic gases used for surgery, such as nitrous oxide or [[enflurane]], are believed to induce anesthesia primarily by acting as [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s, open channel blockers that bind to the inside of the calcium channels on the outer surface of the [[neuron]], and provide high levels of NMDA receptor blockade for a short period of time.\n\nThis makes inhaled anesthetic gases different from other NMDA antagonists, such as [[ketamine]], which bind to a [[regulatory site]] on the NMDA-sensitive calcium transporter complex and provide slightly lower levels of NMDA blockade, but for a longer and much more predictable duration. This makes a deeper level of anesthesia achievable more easily using anesthetic gases but can also make them more dangerous than other drugs used for this purpose.\n\n[[File:Contact-cement 000000.jpg|thumb|100px|Contact cement, a fast-drying glue, is widely used as an inhalant, as it typically contains solvents such as [[toluene]] which vaporize at room temperature.]]\n\n===Chemical structure===\nInhalants can also be classified by chemical structure.<ref name=\"urlInhalants: eMedicine Neurology\">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1174630-overview |title=Inhalants: eMedicine Neurology |work= |accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> Classes include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Nitrous oxide gases from whipped cream aerosol cans, aerosol hairspray or non-stick frying spray are sprayed into plastic bags. Some nitrous oxide users spray the gas into balloons. When inhaling non-stick cooking spray or other aerosol products, some users may filter the aerosolized particles out with a rag. Some gases, such as propane and butane gases, are inhaled directly from the canister. Once these solvents or gases are inhaled, the extensive capillary surface of the [[human lung|lung]]s rapidly absorb the solvent or gas, and blood levels peak rapidly. The intoxication effects occur so quickly that the effects of inhalation can resemble the intensity of effects produced by intravenous injection of other psychoactive drugs.<ref>{{cite web\n |last = Joseph\n |first = Donald E.\n |title = Inhalants\n |work = Drugs of Abuse\n |publisher = United States Drug Enforcement Administration\n |year = 2005\n |url = http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/abuse/doa-p.pdf\n |accessdate = 26 January 2011\n |deadurl = yes\n |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110101125817/http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/abuse/doa-p.pdf\n |archivedate = 1 January 2011\n |df = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref> Some [[harm reduction]] experts encourage glue sniffers to use paper bags rather than thin plastic bags, because plastic bags greatly increase the risk of [[suffocation]], as plastic bags are more likely to stick to the users' nose and mouth while she or he is intoxicated.\n\nEthanol is also inhaled, either by vaporizing it by pouring it over [[dry ice]] in a narrow container and inhaling with a straw or by pouring alcohol in a corked bottle with a pipe, and then using a bicycle pump to make a [[spray (liquid drop)|spray]].

A person who has inhaled a small amount of rubber cement or paint thinner vapor may be impaired in a manner resembling alcohol inebriation. A person who has inhaled a larger quantity of solvents or gases, or a stronger chemical, may experience stronger effects such as distortion in perceptions of time and space, [[hallucination]]s, and emotional disturbances. The effects of inhalant use are also modified by the combined use of inhalants and alcohol or other drugs.\n\nIn the short term, many users experience headache, nausea and vomiting, slurred speech, loss of [[motor coordination]], and wheezing. A characteristic \"glue sniffer's rash\" around the nose and mouth is sometimes seen after prolonged use. An odor of paint or solvents on clothes, skin, and breath is sometimes a sign of inhalant abuse, and paint or solvent residues can sometimes emerge in sweat.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = The Public Health Bush Book\n | publisher = Northern Territory Government, Department of Health and Community Services\n |year= 2002\n | url = http://www.nt.gov.au/health/healthdev/health_promotion/bushbook/volume2/chap1/petrol.htm\n | accessdate = 27 December 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:canned-air.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-cleaning dusters are dangerous to inhale, because the gases expand and cool rapidly upon being sprayed.]]\n\nAccording to NIH, even a single session of inhalant abuse \"can disrupt heart rhythms and lower oxygen levels\", which can lead to death. \"Regular abuse can result in serious harm to the brain, heart, kidneys and liver.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/inhalants.html|title=Inhalants: MedlinePlus|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Dangers and health problems==\n[[File:Rational harm assessment of drugs radar plot.svg|thumb|left|Addiction experts in psychiatry, chemistry, pharmacology, forensic science, epidemiology, and the police and legal services engaged in [[Delphi method|delphic analysis]] regarding 20 popular recreational drugs.

One major risk is [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (lack of oxygen), which can occur due to inhaling fumes from a plastic bag, or from using proper inhalation mask equipment (e.g., a medical mask for nitrous oxide) but not adding oxygen or room air. Another danger is freezing the throat. When a gas that was stored under high pressure is released, it cools abruptly and can cause [[frostbite]] if it is inhaled directly from the container. This can occur, for example, with inhaling nitrous oxide. When nitrous oxide is used as an automotive [[Nitrous|power adder]], its cooling effect is used to make the fuel-air charge denser. In a person, this effect is potentially lethal. Many inhalants are volatile [[organic chemicals]] and can catch fire or explode, especially when combined with smoking. As with many other drugs, users may also injure themselves due to loss of coordination or impaired judgment, especially if they attempt to drive.\n\nSolvents have many potential risks in common, including pneumonia, [[cardiac failure]] or arrest,<ref name=\"gdcada.org\"/> and aspiration of vomit. The inhaling of some solvents can cause hearing loss, limb spasms, and damage to the central nervous system and brain.<ref name=\"gdcada.org\"/> Serious but potentially reversible effects include liver and kidney damage and blood-oxygen depletion. Death from inhalants is generally caused by a very high concentration of fumes. Deliberately inhaling solvents from an attached paper or plastic bag or in a closed area greatly increases the chances of suffocation. Brain damage is typically seen with chronic long-term use as opposed to short-term exposure.<ref name=\"emedicine.com\"/> [[Parkinsonism]] (see: [[Signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease]]) has been associated with huffing.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ana.410350516 |title=Parkinsonism induced by solvent abuse |year=1994 |last1=Uitti |first1=Ryan J. |last2=Snow |first2=Barry J. |last3=Shinotoh |first3=Hitoshi |last4=Vingerhoets |first4=Francois J.

There is some evidence of birth defects and disabilities in babies born to women who sniffed solvents such as gasoline.\n\nIn the short term, death from solvent abuse occurs most commonly from [[drowning|aspiration of vomit]] while unconscious or from a combination of [[respiratory depression]] and [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], the second cause being especially a risk with heavier-than-air vapors such as [[butane]] or [[gasoline]] vapor. Deaths typically occur from complications related to excessive sedation and vomiting. Actual overdose from the drug does occur, however, and inhaled solvent abuse is statistically more likely to result in life-threatening respiratory depression than [[intravenous]] use of opiates such as [[heroin]]. Most deaths from solvent abuse could be prevented if individuals were resuscitated quickly when they stopped breathing and their airway cleared if they vomited. However, most inhalant abuse takes place when people inhale solvents by themselves or in groups of people who are intoxicated. Certain solvents are more hazardous than others, such as gasoline.\n\nIn contrast, a few inhalants like amyl nitrate and [[diethyl ether]] have medical applications and are not toxic in the same sense as solvents, though they can still be dangerous when used recreationally. Nitrous oxide is thought to be particularly non-toxic, though heavy long-term use can lead to a variety of serious health problems linked to destruction of [[vitamin B12]] and [[folic acid]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12751548 |year=2003 |last1=Weimann |first1=J |title=Toxicity of nitrous oxide |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=47\u201361 |journal=Best practice & research.

Since reflexive breathing is prompted by elevated carbon dioxide levels (rather than diminished blood oxygen levels), breathing a concentrated, relatively inert gas (such as computer-duster [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|tetrafluoroethane]] or nitrous oxide) that removes carbon dioxide from the blood without replacing it with oxygen will produce no outward signs of suffocation even when the brain is experiencing hypoxia. Once full symptoms of hypoxia appear, it may be too late to breathe without assistance, especially if the gas is heavy enough to lodge in the lungs for extended periods. Even completely inert gases, such as [[argon]], can have this effect if oxygen is largely excluded.\n\n==Legal aspects==\n\n===Solvent glue===\nEven though solvent glue is normally a legal product, there is a case where a court has ruled that supplying glue to children is illegal. [[Khaliq v HM Advocate]] was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] criminal case decided by the [[High Court of Justiciary]] on appeal, in which it was decided that it was an offence at [[common law]] to supply glue sniffing materials that were otherwise legal in the knowledge that they would be used recreationally by children. Two shopkeepers in [[Glasgow]] were arrested and charged with supplying to children \"glue-sniffing kits\" consisting of a quantity of petroleum-based glue in a plastic bag. They argued there was nothing illegal about the items that they had supplied. On appeal, the High Court took the view that, even though glue and plastic bags might be perfectly legal, everyday items, the two shopkeepers knew perfectly well that the children were going to use the articles as inhalants and the charge on the indictment should stand.<ref>SCCR p 492</ref> When the case came to trial at Glasgow High Court the two were sentenced to three years' imprisonment.\n\n\"Thirty-eight of 50 [US] states have enacted laws making various inhalants unavailable to those under the age of 18.

The [[Ramones]], an influential early US punk band, referred to inhalant use in several of their songs. The song \"[[Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue]]\" describes [[adolescent]] boredom, and the song \"Carbona not Glue\" states, \"My brain is stuck from shooting glue.\" An influential punk [[fanzine]] about the subculture and music took its name (''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'') from the Ramones song. The 1980s punk band [[The Dead Milkmen]] wrote a song, \"Life is Shit\" from their album ''[[Beelzebubba]]'', about two friends hallucinating after sniffing glue. Punk-band-turned-hip-hop group the [[Beastie Boys]] penned a song \"Hold it Now \u2013 Hit It\", which includes the line \"cause I'm beer drinkin, breath stinkin, sniffing glue.\" [[Pop punk]] band [[Sum 41]] wrote a song, \"[[Fat Lip]]\", which refers to a character who does not \"make sense from all the gas you be huffing...\" The song ''Lan\u00e7a-perfume'', written and performed by Brazilian popstar [[Rita Lee]], became a national hit in 1980. The song is about chloroethane and its widespread recreational sale and use during the rise of Brazil's carnivals.\n\nInhalants are referred to by bands from other genres, including several [[grunge]] bands\u2014an early 1990s genre that was influenced by punk rock. The 1990s [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], which was influenced by punk music, penned a song, \"[[Dumb (Nirvana song)|Dumb]]\", in which [[Kurt Cobain]] sings \"my heart is broke/But I have some glue/help me inhale /And mend it with you\". [[L7 (band)|L7]], an all-female grunge band, penned a song titled \"Scrap\" about a skinhead who inhales spray-paint fumes until his mind \"starts to gel\". Also in the 1990s, the [[Britpop]] band [[Suede (band)|Suede]] had a UK hit with their song \"[[Animal Nitrate]]\" whose title is a thinly veiled reference to [[amyl nitrite]]. The [[Beck]] song \"Fume\" from his \"Fresh Meat and Old Slabs\" release is about inhaling [[nitrous oxide]]. Another Beck song, \"Cold Ass Fashion\", contains the line \"O.G. \u2013 Original Gluesniffer!\" [[Primus (band)|Primus]]'s 1998 song \"[[Lacquer Head]]\" is about adolescents who use inhalants to get high. [[Hip hop]] performer [[Eminem]] wrote a song, \"Bad Meets Evil\", which refers to breathing \"... ether in three lethal amounts.\" The Brian Jonestown Massacre, a retro-rock band from the 1990s, has a song \"Hyperventilation\", which is about sniffing model-airplane cement. Frank Zappa's song \"Teenage Wind\" from 1981 has a reference to glue sniffing: \"Nothing left to do but get out the 'ol glue; Parents, parents; Sniff it good now...\"\n\n===Films===\nA number of films have depicted or referred to the use of solvent inhalants. In the 1980 comedy film ''[[Airplane!]]'', the character of McCroskey ([[Lloyd Bridges]]) refers to his inhalant use when he states, \"I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.\" In the 1996 film ''[[Citizen Ruth]]'', the character Ruth ([[Laura Dern]]), a homeless drifter, is depicted inhaling [[patio sealant]] from a paper bag in an alleyway. In the tragicomedy ''[[Love Liza]]'', the main character, played by [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], plays a man who takes up building remote-controlled airplanes as a hobby to give him an excuse to sniff the fuel in the wake of his wife's [[suicide]].\n\n[[Harmony Korine]]'s 1997 ''[[Gummo]]'' depicts adolescent boys inhaling contact cement for a high. Edet Belzberg's 2001 documentary ''[[Children Underground]]'' chronicles the lives of Romanian street children addicted to inhaling paint. In ''[[The Basketball Diaries (film)|The Basketball Diaries]]'', a group of boys are huffing carbona cleaning liquid at 3 minutes and 27 seconds into the movie; further on, a boy is reading a diary describing the experience of sniffing the cleaning liquid.\n\nIn the [[David Lynch]] film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', the bizarre and manipulative character played by [[Dennis Hopper]] uses a mask to inhale amyl nitrite.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', [[Steve Martin]]'s character dies from nitrous oxide inhalation. The 1999 independent film ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' depicts two young low-income women inhaling [[aerosol computer cleaner]] (compressed gas) for a buzz. In ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'', [[Michael Caine]]'s character is addicted to inhaling ether vapors.\n\nIn ''[[Thirteen (2003 film)|Thirteen]]'', the main character, a teen, uses a can of aerosol computer cleaner to get high. In the action movie ''[[Shooter (2007 film)|Shooter]]'', an ex-serviceman on the run from the law ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) inhales nitrous oxide gas from a number of Whip-It! whipped cream canisters until he becomes unconscious. The South African film ''[[The Wooden Camera]]'' also depicts the use of inhalants by one of the main characters, a homeless teen, and their use in terms of socio-economic stratification. The title characters in ''[[Samson and Delilah (2009 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' sniff petrol; in Samson's case, possibly causing brain damage.\n\nIn the 2004 film ''[[Taxi (2004 film)|Taxi]]'', [[Queen Latifah]] and [[Jimmy Fallon]] are trapped in a room with a burst tank containing nitrous oxide. Queen Latifah's character curses at Fallon while they both laugh hysterically. Fallon's character asks if it is possible to die from nitrous oxide, to which Queen Latifah's character responds with \"It's laughing gas, stupid!\" Neither of them suffered any side effects other than their voices becoming much deeper while in the room.\n\nIn the French horror film ''[[Them (2006 film)|Them]]'', (2006) a French couple living in Romania are pursued by a gang of street children who break into their home at night. Olivia Bonamy's character is later tortured and forced to inhale aurolac from a silver-colored bag. During a flashback scene in the 2001 film ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'', Hannibal Lecter gets Mason Verger high on amyl nitrite poppers, then convinces Verger to cut off his own face and feed it to his dogs.\n\n===Books===\nThe [[science fiction]] story \"[[Waterspider]]\" by [[Philip K. Dick]] (first published in January 1964 in [[If (magazine)|''If'' magazine]]) contains a scene in which characters from the future are discussing the culture of the early 1950s. One character says: \"You mean he sniffed what they called 'airplane dope'? He was a 'glue-sniffer'?\", to which another character replies: \"Hardly. That was a mania among adolescents and did not become widespread in fact until a decade later. No, I am speaking about imbibing alcohol.\"<ref name=\"Dick\">Philip K. Dick: ''Minority Report'', Millennium Books, 2000 ({{ISBN|978-1-85798-947-2}}). See page 221.</ref>\n\nThe book ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (book)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' describes how the two main characters inhale [[diethyl ether]] and [[amyl nitrite]]. \n\n===Television===\nIn the comedy series ''[[Newman and Baddiel in Pieces]]'', Rob Newman's inhaling gas from a foghorn was a running joke in the series. One episode of the ''[[Jeremy Kyle Show]]'' featured a woman with a 20-year butane gas addiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0sVEJxVQ5Y&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL|title=A Mum Hooked On Butane Gas (PART 1)|website=YouTube|accessdate=19 July 2017}}</ref> In the series ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'', [[Charlie Kelly (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia)|Charlie Kelly]] has an addiction to huffing glue. Additionally, season nine episode 8 shows Dennis, Mac and Dee getting a can of gasoline to use as a solvent, but instead end up taking turns huffing from the canister.\n\nA 2008 episode of the reality show ''[[Intervention (TV series)|Intervention]]'' (season 5, episode 9) featured Allison, who was addicted to huffing [[computer duster]] for the short-lived, psychoactive effects. Allison has since achieved a small but significant [[cult following]] among bloggers and [[YouTube]] users. Several [[remixes]] of scenes from Allison's episode can be found online.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Since 2009, Allison has worked with drug and alcohol treatment centers in Los Angeles County. In the third episode of season 5 of ''[[American Dad!]]'', titled \"Home Adrone\", [[Roger Smith (American Dad!)|Roger]] asks an airline stewardess to bring him industrial adhesive and a plastic bag. In the seventh episode of the fourteenth season of South Park, Towelie, an anthropomorphic towel, develops an addiction to inhaling computer duster. In the show ''[[Squidbillies|Squidbilles]]'', the main character Early Cuyler is often seen inhaling gas or other substances.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Inhaler]] or puffer, a medical device used for delivering medication into the body via the lungs (often used in the treatment of asthma)\n*''[[Khaliq v HM Advocate]]'', a Scottish criminal case in which the court ruled that it is an offense to supply materials that were used for sniffing\n*[[Mt Theo Program]], a successful petrol-sniffing prevention program run by the indigenous Warlpiri community in Central [[Australia]]\n*[[Jenkem]]\n*[[List of medical inhalants]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last= Burk |first= Isabel |title= Inhalant Prevention Resource Guide |publisher= The Health Network |date= 2001 |url= http://www.inhalants.org/Inhalantbook.pdf |format= pdf |edition= 2nd |work= VA Dpt Ed }}\n* {{cite book |last= Chier |first= Ruth |title= Danger: Inhalants |work= The Drug Awareness Library |publisher= Powerkids Press |pages= 24 |date= 2003 |orig-year= 1997 |isbn= 9780823923403 }} \n* {{cite book |last= Lobo |first= Ingrid A. |title= Inhalants |series= Drugs: the Straight Facts |date= 2004 |pages= 112 |isbn= 9780791076361 }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://inhalants.drugabuse.gov/ Inhalants] at [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]]\n* \"[http://teens.drugabuse.gov/drug-facts/inhalants NIDA for Teens: Inhalants]\" at [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]]\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/drugfact/inhalants |title= Inhalants \u2013 Facts and Figures |archive-date= July 2012 |archive-url= http://www.treatment-centers.net/inhalants.html\n |publisher= [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] }}\n\n{{Psychoactive substance use}}\n{{Poisoning and toxicity}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Inhalant Abuse}}\n[[Category:Inhalants|01]]\n[[Category:Substance abuse]]\n[[Category:Drugs acting on the nervous system]]\n[[Category:Drugs acting on the respiratory system]]\n[[Category:Euphoriants]]\n[[Category:Household chemicals]]\n[[Category:Sedatives]]\n[[Category:Hypnotics]]\n[[Category:Psychedelic drugs]]\n[[Category:Dissociative drugs]]\n[[Category:Aerosol propellants]]\n[[Category:Industrial gases]]\n[[Category:General anesthetics]]", "sha1": "f6t3l7rhkhvnmo9cq1e640baoa3n3at"}}, {"title": "Incubus film", "ns": "0", "id": "15503", "redirect": {"title": "Incubus (disambiguation)"}, "revision": {"id": "417624586", "parentid": "343657761", "timestamp": "2011-03-07T16:52:56Z", "contributor": {"username": "Fortdj33", "id": "9056972"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Fixed redirect", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Incubus (disambiguation)]]", "sha1": "3qsg9iedv54jd240vys4oio7hivdkwh"}}, {"title": "Iceman (Marvel Comics)", "ns": "0", "id": "15505", "revision": {"id": "863948107", "parentid": "863929773", "timestamp": "2018-10-14T03:32:02Z", "contributor": {"ip": "76.231.73.99"}, "comment": "rvt - is that a reliable source?", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|Marvel Comics superhero}}\n{{About|the X-Men character|the DC Comics character Ice Man|Underworld Unleashed}}\n{{Infobox comics character\n| image          = Iceman (Bobby Drake).png\n| caption        = Art by [[Carlos Pacheco]]\n| character_name = Iceman\n| real_name      = Robert Louis \"Bobby\" Drake\n| species        = [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Human mutant]]\n| publisher      = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| debut          = ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #1 (September 1963)\n| creators       = [[Stan Lee]] (Writer) <br />[[Jack Kirby]] (Artist)\n| alliances      = {{Plain list |\n* [[X-Men]]\n* [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]\n* [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]]\n* [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]\n}}\n| aliases        = Drake Roberts, Mister Friese, Frosty\n| powers         = \n* Cold and ice manipulation\n* Ability to assume an enhanced physical form made of solid [[ice]] \n}}\n\n'''Iceman''' ('''Robert Louis \"Bobby\" Drake''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]] and is a founding member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in [[Uncanny X-Men|''The X-Men'']] #1 (September 1963).\n\nIceman is a member of a subspecies of humans known as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s, who are born with superhuman abilities. He has the ability to manipulate ice and cold by freezing [[water vapor]] around him. This allows him to freeze objects, as well as turn his body into [[ice]].\n\nThe character has been frequently present in X-Men and [[Spider-Man]]-related [[American comic book|comics]], video games, animated series, and movies. [[Shawn Ashmore]] portrayed Iceman in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]], and voices the character in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\nCreated by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1963 in comics#September|September 1963]]). Lee later admitted that Iceman was created essentially as a copy of the [[Human Torch]], only using the opposite element for his power.<ref>{{cite news | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = Patrick Daniel | last2 = Lee | first2 = Stan | authorlink2 = Stan Lee | date = August 1993 | title = X Marks the Spot | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 8\u20139 | quote = Then I wanted a character sort of like the Torch.

M. DeMatteis]] and another in the 2000s by Andy Lanning and Dan Abnett, with art by [[Karl Kerschl]]. DeMatteis said of the first series, \"It was my idea, so there was no one to blame but myself. I'll just say that it was a mistake and if the series made any sense whatsoever it was due to [editor] [[Bob Budiansky]].

He was a main character in the first volume of ''X-Factor'', and a star in flashback stories when he was a teenager in ''X-Men: The Hidden Years'' and ''X-Men: First Class''.\n\nIn April 2015, in issue 40 of ''All-New X-Men'', a time-displaced version of the teenaged Iceman was revealed as [[gay]] by his teammate, [[Jean Grey]], who discerned this with her telepathic ability.<ref>Hanks, Henry.

His father is [[Irish-American]] [[Catholic]], and his mother is [[Jewish-American|Jewish]].<ref>''Iceman'' #1 (December 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref> Bobby's powers first manifested when he was on a date with Judy Harmon, and a local bully by the name of Rocky Beasely tried to take Judy away for himself. Knowing Judy could not put up a good fight, Bobby pointed his hand at Beasely and encased him in a block of ice. Later, the local townspeople, having heard of the incident, came looking for him in the form of an angry mob. The local sheriff had no choice but to put Bobby in jail for his own \"protection\". While Bobby sat in his cell at the sheriff station, the outer wall was blown open, and a young man named [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] walked in and offered to take Bobby with him. After Bobby turned him down, the two mutants got into a short battle, which was soon ended by the arrival of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]].<ref>''X-Men'' #44-46</ref>\n\nAfter Xavier spoke with Bobby and his parents, Bobby's parents suggested that he go with Professor Xavier to his \"school for gifted youngsters\". Bobby took the suggestion and left with Professor Xavier and Cyclops to become the second member of the [[X-Men]]. He is later joined by [[Beast (comics)|Henry \"Hank\" McCoy]], [[Jean Grey]], and [[Warren Worthington III]] as the founding members of the X-Men. Drake remains self-conscious regarding the fact that he is the youngest member of the group. Appearing in his original snow covered form, he first battles [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] along with the rest of the team,<ref>''X-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and later the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].<ref>''X-Men'' #4</ref> Bobby Drake's first girlfriend is Zelda.<ref>''X-Men'' #7.

Marvel Comics.</ref> He also battles [[Professor Power]]'s [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] while with the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' #127-129. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Defenders disband, Drake embarks on his career as an accountant.\n\nSome time later, Iceman encounters Mirage, the \"daughter\" of [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]]. Iceman journeys back in time and meets his parents before he was born, and battles Oblivion and Mirage. He then reconciles with his parents.<ref>''Iceman'' #1-4.

Marvel Comics.</ref> With this new team, he encounters [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] for the first time.<ref>''X-Factor'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring his time with the team, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] captures Bobby, hoping to use him to gain control over the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. Loki enhances Bobby's powers and then extracts them to restore the size of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. Iceman is rescued by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Thor'' #377-378. Marvel Comics.</ref> Loki's tampering increases Bobby's powers to such an extent that he begins to lose control of his abilities. During a later battle with the [[The Right (comics)|Right]], he is fitted with a power-dampening belt which actually helps him control his abilities. Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice, Bobby finds he can encase the entirety of the [[Empire State Building]]. With time, Bobby gains sufficient control over his augmented powers and is able to stop using the inhibitor belt. Believing he has achieved his full potential, Bobby does not attempt to develop his abilities further.\n\nWith X-Factor, Bobby then defeats [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Apocalypse's Horsemen]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman helps watch over many of the younger superheroes, something he once was. Most notably, he and Beast help [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]] gain a more normal life. For a brief while, he also helps supervise the [[New Mutants]] and their sister team, the [[X-Terminators]]. They, in turn, save him from the deadly kiss of [[Infectia]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #29-31. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBobby also develops a romantic relationship with [[Opal Tanaka]]. After a session of ice sledding, she discovers threatening mail in her mailbox, a precursor to harassment by her cybernetically-enhanced relatives of the Tatsu Clan of the Yakuza, which Bobby helps her out with.<ref>''X-Factor'' #63-64. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter the \"[[Muir Island Saga]]\", Iceman rejoins the X-Men along with the rest of X-Factor.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281; ''X-Men'' vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\n====Back with the X-Men====\nWhen he rejoined the X-Men it seemed that he learned to control his powers and no longer needed the inhibitor belt, this made him believe he reached the limit of his powers.<ref>''X-Factor'' #70</ref> The X-Men were separated into two groups, Iceman was placed in the gold team, led by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], along with fellow original X-Men Jean Grey (now sans codename) and Archangel.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOne day he took Opal to eat with his parents, however his dad began humiliating her because of her Japanese heritage. The four are attacked by the Cyber-Samurai, which added to William Drake's prejudices about the girl.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #289. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Bobby came across [[Mikhail Rasputin]] he used his mutant abilities on him. Bobby discovered that his potential was still far from being reached as he converted his body into ice, not just covered by it.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #292. Marvel Comics.</ref> By turning his entire body to ice, instead of just wearing an icy exterior, Bobby now was capable of using his power in new, aggressive ways, adding spikes and padding to his ice structure.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #300. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nToo busy with the many threats that the X-Men faced every day, Bobby let his relationship with Opal deteriorate and, when they finally saw each other again after weeks, it was only to save her from an attack by mutant haters. Annoyed that she could only gain his attention by nearly getting killed, Opal broke off their relationship.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #305. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, as he was checking on [[Emma Frost]] who was in a comatose state after the mutant [[Trevor Fitzroy]] unleashed the mutant-hunting Sentinels on Emma Frost and her students known as the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]], the mansion was hit by an electricity breakdown.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #311. Marvel Comics.</ref> Emma woke up disoriented, possessed Bobby's mind, and used his powers in ways Bobby never had; she froze an entire river and traveled through water. She was looking for her pupils but after finding out they were dead, she left Bobby's body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #314. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBobby invites Rogue to tag along on a visit to his parents. Wrongly assuming a romantic relation, his father disapproves of Rogue, verbally attacking them with the same prejudices he expressed with Opal. This time, Bobby had enough and left after telling his father that he should just accept the fact that he is a mutant and he would never fit the definition he has of normal. He was upset that Emma exhibited greater control of his powers than he had. Since Rogue was having problems with Gambit, the two of them go on a road trip to ease their minds.<ref name=\"Uncanny319\"/>\n\nDuring the Legion Quest, Iceman was one of the X-Men who went back in time to stop [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] from killing Magneto. They succeed, but only partially. Legion does not kill Magneto, but instead accidentally murdered Xavier, his own father, years before Legion had been conceived much less born. This paradox caused the events of the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. At the last moment before the original reality ended, Iceman's fellow X-Men, Rogue and Gambit shared a kiss. When reality resumed, Rogue's mind-absorbing touch renders Gambit comatose. Having absorbed some secret haunting memories, she needs to get away from the X-Men and Iceman volunteers to join her on a road trip, though at the same time he was starting to see visions of Emma Frost. When Gambit awoke from his coma, he tracked them down and confronted Rogue about what she saw in his mind. She broke off their relationship officially and left for good. Iceman and Gambit returned to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men (2nd series)'' #45.

They were pitted against a servant of Onslaught named [[Post (comics)|Post]], in a specific battle area of harsh environment to test the extent of their abilities. They won and were returned to the mansion. However, Iceman's chest had been shattered in his ice form during battle, making it impossible to change back to human form.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol 2) #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> He confronted Emma Frost and demanded to know what she did to his powers in his body and how to save himself. She refused to help since she knew that Bobby would have to do it himself. When he captured her with his ice powers, she telepathically showed him his insecurities. By confronting Opal and his father in her simulation, Iceman realized that Emma was right and managed to transform back to his human body with his chest fully intact.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #331\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #331. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Graydon Creed was running for President (with a heavy anti mutant campaign), Bobby was chosen to infiltrate in the campaign. His father stood out in a crowd and spoke in favor of the mutants, which came as a surprise to Bobby. His father's connection with Bobby was discovered, so the people that worked for Graydon captured him and almost beat him to death. Bobby decided to stay away from the X-Men for a while to be with his dad.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #340. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nZero Tolerance came across and Bobby found and helped Cecilia Reyes who was trying to keep a secret that she was a mutant. They also joined with Charlotte Jones and the morlock Marrow. After Bastion was defeated, he took Cecilia and Marrow to the mansion, and soon left the X-Men again for a while to be with his parents.<ref>''X-Men (Vol 2)'' #69. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMuch later, the X-Men found evidence in one of Destiny's journals of a group known as the Twelve, including Xavier, Magneto, Cyclops, Phoenix, Iceman, Polaris, Storm, Cable, Bishop, Sunfire, Mikhail Rasputin and the [[Living Monolith]]. They also learned that the Apocalypse\u2019s Horsemen had been kidnapping these mutants from around the globe. Iceman was captured in the woods near his home by Deathbird, who had become the Horseman War.<ref>''X-Men'' (2nd series) #96. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gathering the remaining Twelve, the X-Men traveled to Egypt and confronted Apocalypse and the Skrulls. Apocalypse and his forces captured all of the Twelve during the battle, using them in a ritual to give the Chaos-Bringer a new body and incredible power. Magneto and Polaris created opposite magnetic polarities, Iceman, Storm, and Sunfire provided elemental extremes, Cyclops, Phoenix, and Cable gave the sheer power of family, Xavier represented the power of mind and Bishop and Mikhail stood for time and space, while the Monolith linked all their energies together. Nate Grey was to be Apocalypse's new host, a powerhouse to store his massive lifeforce. The Twelve managed to free themselves and Cyclops sacrificed his own body and lifeforce to keep Apocalypse from getting Nate. Though the new Apocalypse was defeated, Cyclops seemed lost forever.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol 2) #97. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter that incident, Iceman helped the Beast to secretly enter Genosha, as he wanted to study the legacy-infected mutates. When the High Evolutionary released his anti-mutation wave, they were trapped in the war-ravaged country. With the aid of Magneto, they escaped and joined forces with the rest of the scattered X-Men. They raided the Evolutionary's satellite, disabled the mutation field and defeated Sinister, who had been manipulating the Evolutionary.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #379.

In this journey Iceman developed his powers even further, which led him to no longer be afraid of the natural course of his powers and he returned to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Forever'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref> He joined a new team of X-Men, consisting of Angel, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], Wolverine and Chamber. He was using his abilities in a whole new way now, just channeling the power and not turning his body into ice.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #395. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Second mutation====\n{{MOS|date=March 2015}}\nDuring a heated battle with a recently evolved [[Black Tom Cassidy]], he received a chest wound. After returning to normal his chest did not fully recover and some parts of it remained icy, and he was unable to return them to normal. At first he became afraid of it but in time it made him gain a new attitude in life, even rude at some times.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #413. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nNobody seemed to realize it at the time, but evidently this was an early sign of Iceman undergoing a secondary mutation of his own. When he repeatedly tried to evade his regular medical check-ups, school nurse [[Annie Ghazikhanian]] recognized that something odd was going on with him and pressured him to show her the wound. Bobby made her promise not to tell anyone and showed her that parts of his chest are now made of ice and he is unable to change them back to flesh and blood. Iceman wonders if he will entirely turn into ice on a permanent basis.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #415\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #415. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe developed an attitude that, to some of the newer addition to the X-Men, like [[Stacy X]], [[Juggernaut (Marvel Comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], he comes across as rather arrogant, denouncing their status as team members, as they have not been around as long as he. Iceman even went as far as offending [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] by claiming that only the original five, and no one else, has the right to call themselves an X-Man.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #420. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBobby was further frustrated when Havok and Polaris announced their imminent wedding, him having carried a torch for Lorna for quite some time. In his frustration he turned to Annie, who had problems with the wedding too, as she was secretly in love with Havok. The nurse surprised him with the accusation of him being a racist - feeling comfortable as a mutant who could pass like a human when needed, opposed to being a fully obvious mutant or a \"mere\" human. With his secondary mutation manifesting, though, Iceman was in danger of losing this status. Shocked by the truth of her words, Bobby fully opened up about his fears, that as a man fully made of ice he could never feel the warmth of a physical relationship again. Touched, Annie allowed him to kiss her, but when Havok called off the wedding, wanting to be with Annie instead, she quickly dumped Bobby.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #426\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #426. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUpon encountering [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] and his followers, Iceman's body is shattered from the neck down. Afterward, he regains his entire ice form, but cannot change back to his human appearance. As a result, Bobby becomes both bitter and despondent because of this drastic change.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #429\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #429.

They are pursued by [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]; they manage to get the better of him and take him prisoner, but not before he manages to cripple the jet. While Sunfire is unconscious, Iceman and Sam discuss the Mauraders' plan to eliminate all precognitive mutants and anyone with knowledge of the future as well as retrieving Destiny's Diaries before the Marauders can. During this time, Bobby displayed sub-atomic control of energy transfers when he prevented Sunfire from using his fire-based powers.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #202. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nCannonball and Bobby, telepathically prompted by Emma Frost, attempt to recover the diaries which are hidden in a dilapidated brewery. Mr. Sinister uses the reverse-engineered version of Xavier's [[Cerebro]] to track the pair of X-Men to the brewery. The Marauders attack Cannonball and Iceman and overtake them. Bobby, while in his ice form, suffers a gunshot wound from Mystique, which severs one of his arms above the elbow. Mister Sinister, who takes Cannonball prisoner, attempts to telepathically erase his mind so that the X-Men will find him as an empty shell.  Iceman attacks Sinister, distracting him, which allows both of the X-Men to escape.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #203.

On the way back, they found that the [[Sentinel (comics)#Sentinel Squad O*N*E|O*N*E* Sentinels]] guarding the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]] had become infected by nano-Sentinels and attacked the school. Iceman and New X-Man [[X-23]] helped out in the battle with the O*N*E* Sentinels.  With the help of [[Dust (comics)|Dust]] and X-23, the X-Men were able to survive this battle but the nano-Sentinel infected human escaped.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #493.

Art by [[Walt Simonson]].]]\nIceman possesses the power to instantly decrease the temperature of ambient [[water vapor]] in his immediate environment to below zero degrees Celsius, thereby freezing it into ice. He is able to make ice that will not break unless he wills it to. In this manner he is able to quickly form a great variety of ice structures, including projectiles, shields, ladders, baseball bats, etc. Iceman often makes ice slides which form rapidly beneath and behind his feet, moving him along the slick surface at high speeds.  He is also able to form exceedingly complicated structures within relative short time, such as miniature cities.<ref name=\"Uncanny319\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #319. Marvel Comics.</ref> Originally, Iceman's own body temperature would lower dramatically when his powers were active, reaching {{convert|-105|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} within a few tenths of a second (now his body usually converts to organic ice; see below).  Iceman is immune to sub-zero temperatures; he is also able to perceive the [[thermal energy]] level of objects around him. Because [[cold]] is the absence of heat, Iceman does not actually 'emanate' cold; rather, he decreases thermal energy. As mentioned by writer [[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]], Iceman is \"an [[mutant (Marvel Comics)#Omega-level mutants|Omega-level mutant]]...[and] has powers that can influence the ecosystem of the entire world.\"<ref name=\"Carey\"/> Iceman has yet to tap into his full mutant potential, but over the years he has taken more interest in developing his abilities.{{issue|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn his early appearances, Iceman generally covered his body in a thick layer of what appeared to be snow; hence he looked more like a traditional snowman than an ice-man. Upon further training in the use of his powers, he was able to fashion an armor of solid ice around his body when using his powers, which afforded him some degree of protection against concussive force and projectiles. Later on, he manifested the ability to convert the tissue of his body into organic ice. He sometimes augments his organic ice form with razor sharp adornments to his shoulders, elbows, knees, and fists. Iceman has also been able to move rapidly to another distant location while in his organic ice form, being able to deposit his bodily mass into a river and reconstitute his entire mass a great distance away in a matter of minutes (by temporarily merging his molecules with those of the river). On one occasion, Iceman suffered a severe chest injury while in his ice form and was able to heal himself by converting back into his normal human form.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\n\nIceman is also able to reconstitute his organic ice form if any part of it is damaged, or even if it is completely shattered, without permanently harming himself. He can temporarily add the mass of a body of water to his own, increasing his mass, size, and strength. He can survive not only as ice, but as liquid water and water vapor. He can also transform his body from a gaseous state back to a solid, although it is physically and mentally taxing.<ref name=\"X-Men vol. 2 #190\"/><ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #193. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman can also freeze sea water, as seen during the \"[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]\" [[story arc]]. While he usually does not use his powers in lethal ways, his powers are so vast that they extend to the molecular level, to the point that he can freeze all of the molecules of an object/being with a thought; he once froze every single molecule of water within the body of [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David Haller]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman is also able to dissolve his own icy constructs.<ref name=\"Uncanny319\"/>\n\nIceman's powers were pushed to their limit while possessed by Emma Frost, who used Iceman to discover the fate of her [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]].  During this time Iceman was able to control all forms of moisture, freeze fluids inside people's bodies, travel as a liquid, solid or gas. Not even the combined might of the X-Men Gold team was able to stop Emma Frost in Iceman's body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #313-314. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following this, Bobby confronted Emma about how she was able to use his powers so effectively. While together they made some initial progress, she refused to train him further.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #331\"/> Instead he turned to Storm because they share similar elemental powers and she agreed to tutor him.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #48. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Iceman was injected with Mister Sinister's neuro-inhibiter by Mystique, he was able to save himself by drawing in all of the ambient moisture around him, rapidly replacing his poisoned cells with healthy material before the injection could kill him.<ref name=\"X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3\">''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the 2013\u20132014 \"[[Battle of the Atom]]\" storyline, Iceman's future self revealed that he has the ability to create semi-independent ice structures that can act on their own,<ref name=\"WolX37\">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #37. Marvel Comics.</ref> although one of these structures\u2014demonstrating a Hulk-like physique and intellect\u2014has gone on to join the future version of the Brotherhood.<ref name=\"WolX38\">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #38. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAside from his superhuman powers, Iceman is also a fair hand-to-hand combatant, and received combat training at Xavier's School as well as coaching from the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] while serving with the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions of Los Angeles]]. Iceman has taken as much combat training as Cyclops or Beast.<ref name=\"Carey\">Richards, Dave (August 28, 2008).

[[Comic Book Resources]].</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\n\n===Personality===\nAccording to writer Mike Carey \"one of Iceman's best personality traits is that emotionally Bobby Drake is like the ice he manipulates -- not cold but transparent. 'He's devastatingly honest. He is very up-front with his emotions and his thoughts all the time.'\"<ref name=\"Carey\"/> \"Also, he's obviously incredibly brave both in terms of facing external, physical danger as well as facing up to unpleasant situations and admitting his own mistakes.\"<ref name=\"Carey\"/>\n\n===Friendships and relationships===\nIceman had a brief relationship with a Japanese-American New Yorker named Opal. He subsequently exhibited strong feelings for his fellow X-Man [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], but she did not return those feelings, due to her feelings towards Havok. [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] developed an unrequited crush for Iceman during their time on the same team, though Iceman never did find out about this.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #415\"/> Iceman later had a brief relationship with the Xavier School's nurse, Annie, but she eventually left him for Havok, who had just left Polaris at the altar.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #426\"/> When Iceman attempted to rekindle his relationship with Polaris, that too ended abruptly, and Polaris returned to Havok.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #429\"/> Iceman then had a relationship with the X-Men's enemy Mystique, who later betrayed him, despite her continued fixation on him, in as much as she stated that she would either kill him or cure him of his personal uncertainty.<ref name=\"X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3\"/>\n\n===Sexuality===\nIn ''All-New X-Men'' #40, the time-displaced Iceman is revealed to be gay, which eventually forces the youth to confront the adult version of himself about the matter. As both speak, the adult Iceman confirms the fact and that he had put all his energy into just being an X-Man as he couldn't cope with being a mutant and gay simultaneously. With the help of his younger self and Jean Grey, however, he finally comes to terms with his own sexuality,<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #600\"/> and comes out to fellow gay X-Man [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] in ''Extraordinary X-Men'' #6.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===1602===\nIceman is Roberto Trefusis in the miniseries ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', a member of the group of \"witchbreeds\" founded by [[Alternative versions of Professor X#1602|Carlos Javier]] and led by [[Alternative versions of Cyclops#1602|Scotius Summerisle]]. He is the nephew of naval commander [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]. As in the Marvel Universe, he generates ice and can assume a physical ice form.\n\n===\"Age of Apocalypse\"===\n{{Main|Age of Apocalypse}}\nIn the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline, Bobby, along with the rest of the X-Men, is trained by [[Magneto (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Magneto]].<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> Because Magneto is harder on his students than [[Professor X]], Bobby lacks his 616-counterpart's sense of humor.  Instead, Bobby becomes very cold and inhuman, making his teammates feel uncomfortable. In addition to his normal abilities, Bobby is capable of breaking down his body and merging it with another body of water to travel great distances in a matter of seconds. He can bring others along through a process that he calls \"moisture [[Molecule|molecular]] inversion\", though it is a painful process for the passengers.

Nightcrawler is quickly overwhelmed by Drake's avatars, but eventually forces Iceman into a factory boiler room, where there's not enough moisture in the air for him to effectively use his powers.

In a few episodes, he appears with his and [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]]'s former teammates, the X-Men. In the episode \"Vengeance Of Loki\", he's revealed to be a government agent; his codename is \"Windchill Factor Zero\". In the episode \"Mission: Save The Guardstar\", [[Aurora Dante]] (Lightwave) (his half-sister) was introduced. One entire episode was devoted to Iceman's origin story. Throughout the series, Iceman has a romantic infatuation with [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]].\n* He appeared in the [[X-Men (1992 TV series)|1992 ''X-Men'' animated series]], voiced by [[Dennis Akayama]].

He appears as a member of the X-Men who left after [[Professor X]] went M.I.A. after the Institute was destroyed. Wolverine and Beast went to re-recruit him back on to the X-Men but his parents refused to allow him to return to the team after what happened. Being 18, Bobby had the choice to either stay at home or return to the X-Men and he made the choice to rejoin the team. Since he is still in his teens, he's shown at times acting like a typical teenage boy (such as his facial expression after [[Emma Frost]] walks by him in episode 3). He is also not fond of reading and is a bit lazy as he was napping on a pile of books instead of giving them to Kitty to put away. He apparently has a crush on Shadowcat, as he is caught staring at her dreamily before asking her out for a bite to eat (although they were already eating). It is also hinted she may share those feelings, as in episode 3 when Kitty elbows him for looking at Emma.

Bobby is one of the first students to reach out to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and begins a romantic relationship with her. In ''X2'', he has an uneasy friendship/rivalry with [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]]. His relationship with his family is also strained, and his brother actually turns Bobby in to the police out of jealousy. In ''X-Men: The Last Stand'', his relationship with Rogue appears to be deteriorating, strained by their inability to have physical contact and by his close friendship with [[Kitty Pryde]]. During a battle with Pyro, now working for Magneto's Brotherhood, he achieves the ability to transform into his ice form from the comics. In the original dystopian timeline of ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'',<ref>[https://twitter.com/BryanSinger/status/324237075299856384]</ref>  Iceman is more powerful, transforming into ice and travelling on ice slides, but is nevertheless killed while fighting the [[Sentinel (Marvel Comics)|Sentinels]].

New York: St Martin's Press, 1995, pp. 79-86.</ref>\n\nIsidore received his elementary education in the Cathedral school of Seville. In this institution, the first of its kind in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], a body of learned men including Archbishop Saint Leander of Seville taught the [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]], the classic [[liberal arts]]. Saint Isidore applied himself to study diligently enough that he quickly mastered Latin,<ref>\"His literary style, though lucid, is pedestrian\": Katherine Nell MacFarlane's observation, in \"Isidore of Seville on the Pagan Gods (Origines VIII. 11)\", ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'', New Series, '''70'''.3 (1980):1-40, p. 4, reflects mainstream secular opinion.</ref> and acquired some [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].\n\nTwo centuries of Gothic control of Iberia incrementally suppressed the ancient institutions, classic learning, and manners of the [[Roman Empire]]. The associated culture entered a period of long-term decline. The ruling [[Visigoths]] nevertheless showed some respect for the outward trappings of Roman culture. [[Arianism]] meanwhile took deep root among the Visigoths as the form of Christianity that they received.\n\nScholars may debate whether Isidore ever personally embraced monastic life or affiliated with any religious order, but he undoubtedly esteemed the monks highly.\n\n===Bishop of Seville===\n[[Image:Isidoro de Sevilla (Jos\u00e9 Alcoverro) 01.jpg|thumb|A statue of Isidore of Seville by [[Jos\u00e9 Alcoverro]], 1892, outside the [[Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a]], in [[Madrid]]]]\n[[Image:San Isidoro, Portada del Bautismo de la Catedral de Sevilla.jpg|thumb|[[Seville Cathedral]]. Sculpture of [[Lorenzo Mercadante|Lorenzo Mercadante de Breta\u00f1a]]]]\n\nAfter the death of Saint [[Leander of Seville]] on 13 March 600 or 601, Isidore succeeded to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seville|See of Seville]]. On his elevation to the [[Bishop|episcopate]], he immediately constituted himself as protector of monks.\n\nSaint Isidore recognized that the spiritual and material welfare of the people of his See depended on assimilation of remnant Roman and ruling barbarian cultures, and consequently attempted to weld the peoples and subcultures of the Visigothic kingdom into a united nation. He used all available religious resources toward this end and succeeded. Isidore practically eradicated the heresy of [[Arianism]] and completely stifled the new [[heresy]] of [[Acephali]] at its very outset. Archbishop Isidore strengthened religious discipline throughout his See.\n\nArchbishop Isidore also used resources of education to counteract increasingly influential Gothic barbarism throughout his episcopal jurisdiction. His quickening spirit animated the educational movement centered on Seville. Saint Isidore introduced [[Aristotle]] to his countrymen long before the Arabs studied Greek philosophy extensively.\n\nIn 619, Saint Isidore of Seville pronounced anathema against any ecclesiastic who in any way should molest the monasteries.\n\n===Second Synod of Seville (November 619)===\n{{Main|Second Synod of Seville}}\n\nSaint Isidore presided over the Second Council of Seville, begun on 13 November 619, in the reign of King [[Sisebut]], a provincial council attended by eight other bishops, all from the ecclesiastical province of Baetica in southern Spain. The Acts of the Council fully set forth the nature of Christ, countering the conceptions of Gregory, a Syrian representing the heretical Acephali.\n\n===Third Synod of Seville (624)===\n{{Main|Third Synod of Seville}}\n\nBased on a few surviving canons found in the [[Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals]], Saint Isidore is known to have presided over an additional provincial council around 624.\n\nThe council dealt with a conflict over the [[Episcopal see|See]] of \u00c9cija, and wrongfully stripped bishop Martianus of his see, a situation that was rectified by the Fourth Council of Toledo. It also addressed a concern over Jews who had been forced to convert to Christianity by Sisebut failing to present their children for baptism.\n\nThe records of the council, unlike the First and Second Councils of Seville were not preserved in the [[Collections of ancient canons|Hispana]], a collection of canons and decretals likely edited by Saint Isidore himself.<ref>Rachel Stocking, \"Martianus, Aventius and Isidore: provincial councils in seventh-century Spain\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' 6 (1997) 169-188.</ref>\n\n===Fourth National Council of Toledo===\n{{Main|Fourth Council of Toledo}}\n\nAll bishops of Hispania attended the Fourth National Council of Toledo, begun on 5 December 633. The aged Archbishop Saint Isidore presided over its deliberations and originated most enactments of the council.\n\nThrough Isidore's influence, this Council of Toledo promulgated a decree, commanding all bishops to establish seminaries in their cathedral cities along the lines of the cathedral school at Seville, which had educated Saint Isidore decades earlier. The decree prescribed the study of Greek, Hebrew, and the liberal arts and encouraged interest in law and medicine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Isidore's own work regarding medicine is examined by {{cite journal |last1=Sharpe |first1=William D. |year=1964 |title=Isidore of Seville: The Medical Writings |journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |volume=54 |issue=2}}</ref> The authority of the Council made this education policy obligatory upon all bishops of the Kingdom of the Visigoths. The council granted remarkable position and deference to the king of the Visigoths. The independent Church bound itself in allegiance to the acknowledged king; it said nothing of allegiance to the [[Papacy|Bishop of Rome]].\n\n===Death===\nSaint Isidore of Seville died on 4 April 636 after serving more than 32 years as archbishop of Seville.\n\n==Work==\n{{Catholic philosophy}}\nIsidore's Latin style in the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' and elsewhere, though simple and lucid, reveals increasing local Visigothic traditions.\n\n===''Etymologiae''===\n{{Main|Etymologiae}}\n\n[[Image:Isidoro di siviglia, etimologie, fine VIII secolo MSII 4856 Bruxelles, Bibliotheque Royale Albert I, 20x31,50, pagina in scrittura onciale carolina.jpg|thumb|A page of ''Etymologiae'', [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] manuscript (8th century), [[Brussels]], [[Royal Library of Belgium]]]]\n[[File:Isidori Hispalensis Opera Omnia.tif|thumb|''Isidori Hispalensis Opera Omnia'' (1797)]]\n\nIsidore was the first Christian writer to try to compile a ''[[summa]]'' of universal knowledge, in his most important work, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (taking its title from the method he uncritically used in the transcription of his era's knowledge).

In the process, many fragments of classical learning are preserved which otherwise would have been hopelessly lost; \"in fact, in the majority of his works, including the ''Origines'', he contributes little more than the mortar which connects excerpts from other authors, as if he was aware of his deficiencies and had more confidence in the ''stilus maiorum'' than his own\" his translator Katherine Nell MacFarlane remarks.<ref>MacFarlane 1980:4; MacFarlane translates ''Etymologiae'' viii.</ref>\n\nSome of these fragments were lost in the first place because Isidore's work was so highly regarded\u2014[[Braulio of Zaragoza|Braulio]] called it ''quecunque fere sciri debentur'', \"practically everything that it is necessary to know\"\u2014<ref>Braulio, ''Elogium'' of Isidore appended to Isidore's ''[[De viris illustribus]]'', heavily indebted itself to [[Jerome]].</ref> that it superseded the use of many individual works of the classics themselves, which were not recopied and have therefore been lost: \"all secular knowledge that was of use to the Christian scholar had been winnowed out and contained in one handy volume; the scholar need search no further\".<ref>MacFarlane 1980:4.</ref>\n\nThe fame of this work imparted a new impetus to encyclopedic writing, which bore abundant fruit in the subsequent centuries of the [[Middle Ages]]. It was the most popular compendium in [[medieval]] libraries. It was printed in at least ten editions between 1470 and 1530, showing Isidore's continued popularity in the [[Renaissance]].

Other less known oxides include [[carbon suboxide]] (C<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and [[mellitic anhydride]] (C<sub>12</sub>O<sub>9</sub>).  There are also numerous unstable or elusive oxides, such as [[dicarbon monoxide]] (C<sub>2</sub>O), [[oxalic anhydride]] (C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), and [[carbon trioxide]] (CO<sub>3</sub>). \n\nThere are several [[oxocarbon anion]]s, negative ions that consist solely of oxygen and carbon. The most common are the [[carbonate]] (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>) and [[oxalate]] (C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>).  The corresponding acids are the highly unstable [[carbonic acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and the quite stable [[oxalic acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), respectively.  These anions can be partially deprotonated to give the [[bicarbonate]] (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>) and [[hydrogenoxalate]]  (HC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>).

With its roots in [[market research]], \"competitive intelligence\" has been described as the \"application of principles and practices from military and national intelligence to the domain of global business\";{{sfn|Walker|1996}} it is the business equivalent of [[open-source intelligence]].\n\nThe difference between competitive intelligence and economic or industrial espionage is not clear; one needs to understand the legal basics to recognize how to draw the line between the two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhesq.com/CI/CIR.pdf |title=The Economic Espionage Act: The Rules Have Not Changed, Competitive Intelligence Review, July/August 1998 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhesq.com/CI/Hopefully%20For%20The%20Last%20Time.pdf |title=Competitive Intelligence, Law, and Ethics: The EEA Revisited Again (and Hopefully for the Last Time), Competitive Intelligence Magazine, July/September 2011 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}</ref>  Others maintain it is sometimes quite difficult to tell the difference between legal and illegal methods, especially if considering the ethical side of information gathering, making the definition even more elusive.\n\n==Forms of economic and industrial espionage==\n\nEconomic or industrial espionage takes place in two main forms. In short, the purpose of espionage is to gather knowledge about (an) organization(s). It may include the acquisition of [[intellectual property]], such as information on industrial manufacture, ideas, techniques and processes, recipes and formulas. Or it could include sequestration of proprietary or operational information, such as that on customer datasets, pricing, sales, marketing, research and development, policies, prospective bids, planning or marketing strategies or the changing compositions and locations of production.{{sfn|Nasheri|2005|pp=8, 10, 73}} It may describe activities such as theft of [[trade secrets]], [[bribery]], [[blackmail]] and technological surveillance. As well as orchestrating espionage on commercial organizations, governments can also be targets \u2014 for example, to determine the terms of a tender for a government contract so that another tenderer\n\n==Target industries==\n[[File:Lincoln MKC test vehicle.jpg|thumb|left|During testing, automakers commonly disguise upcoming car models with [[camouflage]] paint patterns designed to obfuscate the vehicle's lines. Padded covers, or deceptive decals are also often used. This is also to prevent Motoring Media-outlets from spoiling the model's big reveal.]] \nEconomic and industrial espionage is most commonly associated with technology-heavy industries, including computer software and hardware, [[biotechnology]], [[aerospace]], [[telecommunications]], transportation and engine technology, [[automobiles]], [[machine tools]], [[Electrical power industry|energy]], [[Materiel|materials]] and [[coatings]] and  so on. [[Silicon Valley]] is known to be one of the world's most targeted areas for espionage, though any industry with information of use to competitors may be a target.{{sfn|Nasheri|2005|p=9}}\n\n==Information theft and sabotage==\n\nInformation can make the difference between success and failure; if a [[trade secret]] is stolen, the competitive playing field is leveled or even tipped in favor of a competitor.\nAlthough a lot of information-gathering is accomplished legally through competitive intelligence, at times corporations feel the best way to get information is to take it.{{sfn|Scalet|2003|p=3}} Economic or industrial espionage is a threat to any business whose livelihood depends on information.\n\nIn recent years, economic or industrial espionage has taken on an expanded definition. For instance, attempts to sabotage a corporation may be considered industrial espionage; in this sense, the term takes on the wider connotations of its parent word. That espionage and [[sabotage]] (corporate or otherwise) have become more clearly associated with each other is also demonstrated by a number of profiling studies, some government, some corporate. The United States government currently has a polygraph examination entitled the \"Test of Espionage and Sabotage\" (TES), contributing to the increasingly popular, though not consensus, notion, by those studying espionage and sabotage countermeasures, of the interrelationship between the two.{{sfn|Department of Defense|2002}} In practice, particularly by \"trusted insiders\", they are generally considered functionally identical for the purpose of informing countermeasures.\n\n==Agents and the process of collection==\n\nEconomic or industrial espionage commonly occurs in one of two ways. Firstly, a dissatisfied employee appropriates information to advance interests or to damage the company. Secondly, a competitor or foreign government seeks information to advance its own technological or financial interest.{{sfn|Nasheri|2005|p=7}} \"[[Mole (espionage)|Moles]]\", or trusted insiders, are generally considered the best sources for economic or industrial espionage.{{sfn|Nasheri|2005|pp=80-81}} Historically known as a \"patsy\", an insider can be induced, willingly or under duress, to provide information. A patsy may be initially asked to hand over inconsequential information and, once compromised by committing a crime, bribed into handing over more sensitive material.{{sfn|Palmer|1974|p=12}} Individuals may leave one company to take up employment with another and take sensitive information with them.{{sfn|Reuters|1996}} Such apparent behavior has been the focus of numerous industrial espionage cases that have resulted in legal battles.{{sfn|Reuters|1996}} Some countries hire individuals to do spying rather than use of their own intelligence agencies.{{sfn|Nasheri|2005|p=80}} Academics, business delegates, and students are often thought to be used by governments in gathering information.{{sfn|Nasheri|2005|p=88}} Some countries, such as Japan, have been reported to expect students be debriefed on returning home.{{sfn|Nasheri|2005|p=88}} A spy may follow a guided tour of a factory and then get \"lost\".{{sfn|Palmer|1974|p=12}} A spy could be an engineer, a maintenance man, a cleaner, an insurance salesman, or an inspector: anyone who has legitimate access to the premises.{{sfn|Palmer|1974|p=12}}\n\nA spy may break into the premises to steal data and may search through waste paper and refuse, known as \"dumpster diving\".{{sfn|Nasheri|2005|p=82}} Information may be compromised via unsolicited requests for information, marketing surveys or use of technical support or research or software facilities. Outsourced industrial producers may ask for information outside the agreed-upon contract.{{sfn|Nasheri|2005|p=84}}\n\nComputers have facilitated the process of collecting information because of the ease of access to large amounts of information through physical contact or the Internet.\n\n==Use of computers and the Internet==\n\n===Personal computers===\nComputers have become key in exercising industrial espionage due to the enormous amount of information they contain and its ease of being copied and transmitted. The use of computers for espionage increased rapidly in the 1990s. Information has been commonly stolen by being copied from unattended computers in offices, those gaining unsupervised access doing so through subsidiary jobs, such as cleaners or repairmen. [[Laptop]]s were, and still are, a prime target, with those traveling abroad on business being warned not to leave them for any period of time. Perpetrators of espionage have been known to find many ways of conning unsuspecting individuals into parting, often only temporarily, from their possessions, enabling others to access and steal information.{{sfn|Boggon|1996}} A \"bag-op\" refers to the use of hotel staff to access data, such as through laptops, in hotel rooms. Information may be stolen in transit, in [[taxicab|taxi]]s, at airport baggage counters, [[baggage carousel]]s, on [[train]]s and so on.{{sfn|Nasheri|2005|p=82}}\n\n===The Internet===\nThe rise of the internet and computer networks has expanded the range and detail of information available and the ease of access for the purpose of industrial espionage.{{sfn|DeWeese|Krekel|Bakos|Barnet|2009}} Worldwide, around 50,000 companies a day are thought to come under [[cyberattack]] with the rate estimated as doubling each year.{{sfn|Glover|2010}} This type of operation is generally identified as state backed or sponsored, because the \"access to personal, financial or analytic resources\" identified exceed that which could be accessed by cybercriminals or individual hackers. Sensitive military or defense engineering or other industrial information may not have immediate monetary value to criminals, compared with, say, bank details. Analysis of cyberattacks suggests deep knowledge of networks, with targeted attacks, obtained by numerous individuals operating in a sustained organized way.{{sfn|DeWeese et al|2009}}\n\n===Opportunities for sabotage===\nThe rising use of the internet has also extended opportunities for industrial espionage with the aim of sabotage. In the early 2000s, it was noticed that energy companies were increasingly coming under attack from hackers. Energy power systems, doing jobs like monitoring power grids or water flow, once isolated from the other computer networks, were now being connected to the internet, leaving them more vulnerable, having historically few built-in security features.{{sfn|Piller|2002}} The use of these methods of industrial espionage have increasingly become a concern for governments, due to potential attacks by terrorist groups or hostile foreign governments.\n\n===Malware===\nOne of the means of perpetrators conducting industrial espionage is by exploiting vulnerabilities in computer software. [[Malware]] and [[spyware]] as \"a tool for industrial espionage\", in \"transmitting digital copies of trade secrets, customer plans, future plans and contacts\". Newer forms of malware include devices which surreptitiously switch on mobile phones camera and recording devices. In attempts to tackle such attacks on their intellectual property, companies are increasingly keeping important information off network, leaving an \"air gap\", with some companies building \"Faraday cages\" to shield from electromagnetic or cellphone transmissions.{{sfn|Lohr|2010}}\n\n===Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack===\nThe [[distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) attack uses  compromised computer systems to orchestrate a flood of requests on the target system, causing it to shut down and deny service to other users.{{sfn|Nasheri|2005|p=112}} It could potentially be used for economic or industrial espionage with the purpose of sabotage. This method was allegedly utilized by Russian secret services, over a period of two weeks on a [[Cyberwarfare|cyberattack]] on Estonia in May 2007, in response to the removal of a Soviet era war memorial.{{sfn|Anderson|2007}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Lettre du pere Entrecolles 1712 du Halde 1735.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The work of Father [[Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles]] to reveal to Europe the manufacturing methods of [[Chinese porcelain]] in 1712, is sometimes considered an early case of industrial espionage{{sfn|Rowe|Brook|2009|p=84}}]]Economic and industrial espionage has a long history.

One such operation, known as \"Operation Brunnhilde\" operated from the mid-1950s until early 1966 and made use of spies from many [[Communist Bloc]] countries. Through at least 20 forays, many western European industrial secrets were compromised.{{sfn|Palmer |1974|p=13}} One member of the \"Brunnhilde\" ring was  a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[chemical engineer]], Dr. Jean Paul Soupert (also known as \"Air Bubble\"), living in [[Brussels]].

Writing in the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]], Philip Hanson detailed a ''spetsinformatsiya'' system in which 12 industrial branch ministries formulated requests for information to aid technological development in their military programs. Acquisition plans were described as operating on 2 year and 5 year cycles with about 3000 tasks under way each year. Efforts were aimed at civilian as well as military industrial targets, such as in the [[Petrochemical industry|petrochemical industries]]. Some information was garnered so as to compare levels of competitor to Soviet technological advancement. Much unclassified information was also gathered, blurring the boundary with \"competitive intelligence\".{{sfn|Hanson|1987}}\n\nThe [[Soviet military#The Cold War|Soviet military]] was recognised as making much better use of acquired information, compared to civilian industry, where their record in replicating and developing industrial technology was poor.{{sfn|Hanson|1987}}\n\n===The legacy of Cold War espionage===\nFollowing the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the [[Cold War]], commentators, including the [[United States Congress|US Congressional]] Intelligence Committee, noted a redirection amongst the espionage community from military to industrial targets, with Western and former communist countries making use of \"underemployed\" spies and expanding programs directed at stealing such information.{{sfn|Nodoushani|Nodoushani|2002}}{{sfn|Nasheri|2005|p=53}}\n\nThe legacy of Cold War spying included not just the redirection of personnel but  the use of spying apparatus such as computer databases, [[Covert listening device|scanners for eavesdropping]], [[spy satellites]], [[Covert listening device|bugs]] and [[Covert listening device|wires]].{{sfn|Nasheri|2005|pp=53-54}}\n\n==Notable cases==\n\n===France and the United States===\nBetween 1987 and 1989, [[IBM]] and [[Texas Instruments]] were thought to have been targeted by French spies with the intention of helping France's [[Groupe Bull]].{{sfn|New York Times: Paris|1991}}  In 1993, U.S. aerospace companies were also thought to have been targeted by French interests.{{sfn|Jehl|1993}} During the early 1990s, France was described as one of the most aggressive pursuers of espionage to garner foreign industrial and technological secrets.{{sfn|New York Times: Paris|1991}} France accused the U.S. of attempting to sabotage its high tech industrial base.{{sfn|New York Times: Paris|1991}} The government of France has been alleged to have conducted ongoing industrial espionage against American aerodynamics and satellite companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hanford.gov/files.cfm/frenchesp.pdf |author=John A.

Using targeted emails it compromised thousands of computers in governmental organisations, enabling attackers to scan for information and transfer this back to a \"digital storage facility in China\".{{sfn|Markoff|Barboza|2010}}\n\n===Google and Operation Aurora===\nOn 13 January 2010, [[Google]] announced that operators, from within China, had hacked into their Google China operation, stealing intellectual property and, in particular, accessing the email accounts of human rights activists.{{sfn|Harvey|2010}}{{sfn|Branigan|2010}} The attack was thought to have been part of a more widespread cyber attack on companies within China which has become known as [[Operation Aurora]].{{sfn|Branigan|2010}} Intruders were thought to have launched a [[zero-day attack]], exploiting a weakness in the [[Microsoft]] [[Internet Explorer]] browser, the malware used being a modification of the [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan]] \"Hydraq\".{{sfn|Lohr|2010}} Concerned about the possibility of hackers taking advantage of this previously unknown weakness in Internet Explorer, the governments of Germany and, subsequently France, issued warnings not to use the browser.{{sfn|Ahmed|2010}}\n\nThere was speculation that \"insiders\" had been involved in the attack, with some Google China employees being denied access to the company's internal networks after the company's announcement.{{sfn|Beaumont|2010}}{{sfn|Reuters Shanghai|2010}} In February 2010, computer experts from the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] claimed that the attacks on Google probably originated from two Chinese universities associated with expertise in computer science,  [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] and the [[Shandong Lanxiang Vocational School]], the latter having close links to the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese military]].{{sfn|Markoff|Barboza|2010}}\n\nGoogle claimed at least 20 other companies had also been targeted in the cyber attack, said by the ''London [[The Times|Times]]'', to have been part of an \"ambitious and sophisticated attempt to steal secrets from unwitting corporate victims\" including \"defence contractors, finance and technology companies\".{{sfn|Branigan|2010}}{{sfn|Harvey|2010}}{{sfn|Ahmed|2010}} Rather than being the work of individuals or organised criminals, the level of sophistication of the attack was thought to have been \"more typical of a nation state\".{{sfn|Harvey|2010}} Some commentators speculated as to whether the attack was part of what is thought to be a concerted Chinese industrial espionage operation aimed at getting \"high-tech information to jump-start China's economy\".{{sfn|Lawson|2010}} Critics pointed to what was alleged to be a lax attitude to the intellectual property of foreign businesses in China, letting them operate but then seeking to copy or [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] their technology for the benefit of Chinese \"national champions\".{{sfn|Rogin|2010}} In Google's case, they may have (also) been concerned about the possible misappropriation of source code or other technology for the benefit of Chinese rival [[Baidu]]. In March 2010 Google subsequently decided to cease offering censored results in China, leading to the closing of its Chinese operation.\n\n===CyberSitter and Green Dam===\nThe US based firm [[CyberSitter]] announced in January 2010 that it was suing the Chinese government, and other US companies, for stealing its anti pornography software, with the accusation that it had been incorporated into China's [[Green Dam]] program, used by the state to censor children's internet access. CyberSitter accused Green Dam creators as having copied around 3000 lines of code. They were described as having done 'a sloppy job of copying,' with some lines of the copied code continuing to direct people to the CyberSitter website. The [[lawyer|attorney]] acting for CyberSitter maintained \"I don't think I have ever seen such clear-cut stealing\".{{sfn|Newman|2010}}\n\n===''USA v. Lan Lee, et al.''===\nThe United States charged two former NetLogic Inc. engineers, Lan Lee and Yuefei Ge, of committing economic espionage against TSMC and NetLogic, Inc. A jury acquitted the defendants of the charges with regard to TSMC and deadlocked on the charges with regard to NetLogic. In May 2010, a federal judge dismissed all the espionage charges against the two defendants. The judge ruled that the U.S. Government presented no evidence of espionage.{{sfn|Levine|2010}}\n\n===Dongxiao Yue and Chordiant Software, Inc.===\nIn May 2010, the federal jury convicted Chordiant Software, Inc., a U.S. corporation, of stealing Dongxiao Yue's JRPC technologies and used them in a product called Chordiant Marketing Director.

The exact date of his birth is uncertain, but most probably it was November 21, 1902, a date that Singer gave both to his official biographer Paul Kresh,{{Sfn | Kresh | 1979 | p = 390}} and his secretary Dvorah Telushkin.{{Sfn | Telushkin | 1997 | p = 266}}  It is also consistent with the historical events he and his brother refer to in their childhood memoirs. The often-quoted birth date, July 14, 1904 was made up by the author in his youth, most probably to make himself younger to avoid the draft.{{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | pp = 18\u201319}}\n\nHis father was a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[rabbi]] and his mother, Bathsheba, was the daughter of the rabbi of [[Bi\u0142goraj]]. Singer later used her name in his pen name \"Bashevis\" (Bathsheba's). Both his older siblings, sister [[Esther Kreitman]] (1891\u20131954) and brother [[Israel Joshua Singer]] (1893\u20131944), became writers as well.  Esther was the first of the family to write stories.{{Sfn | Carr | 1992}}\n\nThe family moved to the court of the Rabbi of Radzymin in 1907, where his father became head of the Yeshiva. After the Yeshiva building burned down in 1908, the family moved to a flat at ul. Krochmalna 10. In the spring of 1914, the Singers moved to No. 12.<ref>{{Citation |first=J |last=Leociak |title=Spojrzenia na warszawskie getto.

There his father served as a rabbi, and was called on to be a judge, arbitrator, religious authority and spiritual leader in the Jewish community.{{Sfn | Singer | 1967}} The unique atmosphere of pre-war Krochmalna Street can be found both in the collection of ''Varshavsky-stories'', which tell stories from Singer's childhood,<ref>Best known: ''My Father's Court'' 1966</ref> as well as in those novels and stories which take place in pre-war Warsaw.<ref>''Die familye Mushkat''/''The Family Moskat'' 1950, ''Shoym'' 1967/Scum 1991, etc.</ref>\n\n===World War I===\nIn 1917, because of the hardships of World War I, the family split up. Singer moved with his mother and younger brother Moshe to his mother's hometown of Bi\u0142goraj, a traditional ''[[shtetl]],'' where his mother's brothers had followed his grandfather as rabbis.{{Sfn | Singer | 1967}}  When his father became a village rabbi again in 1921, Singer returned to [[Warsaw]]. He entered the [[Tachkemoni]] Rabbinical Seminary and soon decided that neither the school nor the profession suited him. He returned to Bi\u0142goraj, where he tried to support himself by giving [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] lessons, but soon gave up and joined his parents, considering himself a failure. In 1923 his older brother Israel Joshua arranged for him to move to Warsaw to work as a proofreader for the Jewish ''Literarische Bleter,'' of which the brother was an editor.{{Sfn | Singer | 1976}}\n\n===United States===\nIn 1935, four years before the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]], Singer emigrated from [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] to the United States. He was fearful of the growing Nazi threat in neighboring Germany.<ref>{{Citation | first = Kristina | last = Maul | title = Communication and Society in Jewish American Short Stories | publisher = GRIN Verlag | year = 2007 | page = 19 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sl1jSXDV7nwC&pg=PA19&as_brr=3}}.</ref> The move separated the author from his common-law first wife Runia Pontsch and son Israel Zamir (1929\u20132014); they emigrated to [[Moscow]] and then [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. The three met again twenty years later in 1955.\n\nSinger settled in [[New York City]], where he took up work as a journalist and columnist for ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' ({{lang |yi|\u05e4\u05bf\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05f0\u05e2\u05e8\u05d8\u05e1}}), a Yiddish-language newspaper.  After a promising start, he became despondent and for some years felt \"''Lost in America''\" (title of his 1974 novel published in Yiddish; published in English in 1981).\n\nIn 1938, he met Alma Wassermann [[n\u00e9e]] Haimann (1907\u20131996), a German-Jewish refugee from [[Munich]]. They married in 1940, and their union seemed to release energy in him; he  returned to prolific writing and to contributing to the ''Forward''. In addition to his pen name of \"Bashevis,\" he published under the pen names of \"Warszawski\" (pron.

The full academic scholarship for undergraduate students at the [[University of Miami]] is also named in his honor.\n\n==Literary career==\nSinger's first published story won the literary competition of the ''literarishe bletter'' and garnered him a reputation as a promising talent. A reflection of his formative years in \"the kitchen of literature\"{{Sfn | Telushkin | 1997 | p = 123}} can be found in many of his later works. IB Singer published his first novel, ''Satan in Goray'', in installments in the literary magazine ''Globus'', which he had co-founded with his life-long friend, the Yiddish poet [[Aaron Zeitlin]] in 1935. The book recounts events of 1648 in the village of Goraj (close to [[Bi\u0142goraj]]), where the Jews of Poland lost a third of their population in a wholesale attack by [[Cossacks]]. It explores the effects of the seventeenth-century faraway false messiah, [[Shabbatai Zvi]], on the local population. Its last chapter imitates the style of a medieval Yiddish chronicle. With a stark depiction of innocence crushed by circumstance, the novel appears to foreshadow coming danger. In his later work, ''The Slave'' (1962), Singer returns to the aftermath of 1648, in a love story between a Jewish man and a [[Gentile]] woman.  He portrays the traumatized and desperate survivors of the historic catastrophe with even deeper understanding.\n\n===''The Family Moskat''===\nSinger became a literary contributor to the ''Forward'' only after his older brother Israel died in 1945. That year, Singer published ''The Family Moskat'' in his brother's honor. His own style showed in the daring turns of his action and characters, with double adultery during the holiest of nights of Judaism, the evening of [[Yom Kippur]] (despite being printed in a Jewish family newspaper in 1945). He was almost forced to stop writing the novel by his legendary editor-in-chief, [[Abraham Cahan]], but was saved by readers who wanted the story to go on. After this, his stories\u2014which he had published in Yiddish literary newspapers before\u2014were printed in the ''Forward'' as well. Throughout the 1940s, Singer's reputation grew.\n\nSinger believed in the power of his native language and thought that there was still a large audience, including in New York, who longed to read in Yiddish. In an interview in ''Encounter'' (February 1979), he claimed that although the [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews of Poland]] had died, \"something\u2014call it spirit or whatever\u2014is still somewhere in the universe. This is a mystical kind of feeling, but I feel there is truth in it.\"\n\nSome of his colleagues and readers were shocked by his all-encompassing view of human nature. He wrote about female homosexuality (\"Zeitl and Rickel\",{{Sfn | Singer | 1968}} \"Tseytl un Rikl\"), published in ''The Seance and Other Stories''{{Sfn | Singer | 1968a}}), [[transvestism]] (\"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy\" in ''Short Friday''), and of rabbis corrupted by demons (\"Zeidlus the Pope\" in ''Short Friday''). In those novels and stories which refer to events in his own life, he portrays himself unflatteringly (with some degree of accuracy) as an artist who is self-centered yet has a keen eye for the sufferings and tribulations of others.\n\n===Literary influences===\nSinger had many literary influences; besides the religious texts he studied, he grew up with a rich array of Jewish folktales and worldly Yiddish detective-stories about \"[[Max Spitzkopf]]\" and his assistant \"Fuchs\".{{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | p = 35}} He read Russian, including [[Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' at the age of fourteen.{{Sfn | Bashevis | 1967}} He wrote in memoirs about the importance of the Yiddish translations donated in book-crates from America, which he studied as a teenager in Bilgoraj: \"I read everything: Stories, novels, plays, essays... I read [[Avrom Reyzen|Rajsen]], [[Strindberg]], Don Kaplanowitsch, [[Turgenev]], [[Tolstoy]], [[Maupassant]] and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]].\"{{Sfn | Bashevis | 1967}}  He studied many philosophers, among them [[Spinoza]],{{Sfn | Bashevis | 1967}}  [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],{{Sfn | Carr | 1992}} and [[Otto Weininger]].{{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | p = 68}}  Among his Yiddish contemporaries, Singer considered his older brother to be his greatest artistic example; he was also a life-long friend and admirer of the author and poet [[Aaron Zeitlin]].\n\nOf his non-Yiddish-contemporaries, he was strongly influenced by the writings of [[Knut Hamsun]], many of whose works he later translated, while he had a more critical attitude towards [[Thomas Mann]], whose approach to writing he considered opposed to his own.{{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | p = 88}} Contrary to Hamsun's approach, Singer shaped his world not only with the egos of his characters, but also using the moral commitments of the Jewish tradition known from his youth and embodied by his father in the stories about Singer's youth. There was a dichotomy between the life his heroes lead and the life they feel they should lead \u2014 which gives his art a modernity his predecessors did not express. His themes of witchcraft, mystery and legend draw on traditional sources, but they are contrasted with a modern and ironic consciousness. They are also concerned with the bizarre and the grotesque.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nAnother important strand of his art is intra-familial strife, which he experienced firsthand when taking refuge with his mother and younger brother at his uncle's home in Bi\u0142goraj. This is the central theme in Singer's big family chronicles, such as ''The Family Moskat'' (1950), ''The Manor'' (1967), and ''The Estate'' (1969). Some critics believe these show the influence of [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''Buddenbrooks''; Singer had translated Mann's ''Der Zauberberg'' (''[[The Magic Mountain]]'') into Yiddish as a young writer.\n\n===Language===\nSinger always wrote and published in Yiddish. His novels were serialized in newspapers, which also published his short stories. He edited his novels and stories for their publication in English in the United States; these versions were used as the basis for translation into other languages. He referred to his English version as his \"second original\". This has led to an ongoing controversy whether the \"real Singer\" can be found in the Yiddish original, with its finely tuned language and sometimes rambling construction, or in the more tightly edited American versions, where the language is usually simpler and more direct.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Many of Singer's stories and novels have not yet been translated.\n\nIn the short story form, in which many critics feel he made his most lasting contributions, his greatest influences were writers [[Anton Chekhov]] and [[Guy de Maupassant]], Russian and French, respectively. From Maupassant, Singer developed a finely grained sense of drama.  Like those of the French master, Singer's stories can pack enormous visceral excitement in the space of a few pages.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} From Chekhov, Singer developed his ability to draw characters of enormous complexity and dignity in the briefest of spaces.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In the foreword to his personally selected volume of his finest short stories he describes the two aforementioned writers as the greatest masters of the short story form.\n\n===Illustrators===\nSeveral respected artists have illustrated Singer's novels, short stories, and children's books, including [[Raphael Soyer]], [[Maurice Sendak]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Irene Lieblich]]. Singer personally selected Lieblich to illustrate two of his books for children, ''A Tale of Three Wishes'' and ''The Power of Light: Eight Stories for Hanukkah,'' after seeing her paintings at an Artists Equity exhibition in New York City. A Holocaust survivor, Lieblich was from Zamosc, Poland, a town adjacent to the area where Singer was raised. As their memories of shtetl life were so similar, Singer found Lieblich's images ideally suited to illustrate his texts. Of her style, Singer wrote that \"her works are rooted in Jewish folklore and are faithful to Jewish life and the Jewish spirit.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Summary===\nSinger published at least 18 novels, 14 children's books, a number of memoirs, essays and articles. He is best known as a writer of short stories, which have been published in more than a dozen collections. The first collection of Singer's short stories in English, ''[[Gimpel the Fool]]'', was published in 1957. The title story was translated by [[Saul Bellow]] and published in May 1953 in the ''[[Partisan Review]]''. Selections from Singer's \"Varshavsky-stories\" in the ''Daily Forward'' were later published in anthologies such as ''My Father's Court'' (1966). Later collections include ''A Crown of Feathers'' (1973), with notable masterpieces in between, such as ''The Spinoza of Market Street'' (1961) and ''A Friend of Kafka'' (1970). His stories and novels reflect the world of the East European Jewry in which he grew up. After his many years in America, his stories also portrayed the world of the immigrants and their pursuit of an elusive American dream, which seems always beyond reach.\n\nPrior to Singer's winning the Nobel Prize, English translations of dozens of his stories were frequently published in popular magazines such as ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''. They were publishing literary works and included his stories among their best; in turn, he found them to be appropriate outlets for his work.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Singer continued to write on questions of personal morality. Because of the controversial aspects of his plots, he was a target of scathing criticism from many quarters, some of it for not being \"moral\" enough, some for writing stories that no one wanted to hear. To his critics he replied, \"Literature must spring from the past, from the love of the uniform force that wrote it, and not from the uncertainty of the future.\" {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nSinger was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978.<ref name=nobellecture>{{Citation | year = 1978 | last = Singer | first = Isaac Bashevis | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1978/singer-lecture.html | publisher = Nobel prize | title = Lecture}}.</ref>\n\n===Film adaptations===\nHis novel ''Enemies, a Love Story'' was adapted as a [[Enemies, a Love Story (film)|film by the same name]] (1989) and was quite popular, bringing new readers to his work. He featured a Holocaust survivor who deals with varying desires, complex family relationships, and a loss of faith.\n\nSinger's story, \"[[Yentl|Yentl, the Yeshiva Boy]],\" was adapted into a [[Yentl (film)|film by that name]] (1983) starring and directed by [[Barbra Streisand]].\n\n[[Alan Arkin]] starred as Yasha, the principal character in the 1979 film version of [[The Magician of Lublin]], which also featured [[Shelley Winters]], [[Louise Fletcher]], [[Valerie Perrine]] and [[Lou Jacobi]].  In the final scene, Yasha achieves his lifelong ambition of being able to fly, though not quite as the magic trick he had originally planned.\n\nPerhaps the most fascinating{{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | p = 161}} Singer-inspired film is 1974's ''Mr. Singer's Nightmare or Mrs. Pupkos Beard,'' directed by [[Bruce Davidson (photographer)|Bruce Davidson]], a renowned photographer who became Singer's neighbor. This unique film is a half-hour mixture of documentary and fantasy for which Singer wrote the script and played the leading role.\n\nThe 2007 film ''[[Love Comes Lately]]'', starring [[Otto Tausig]], was adapted from several of Singer's stories.\n\n==Beliefs==\n\n===Judaism===\nSinger's relationship to Judaism was complex and unconventional. He identified as a skeptic and a loner, though he felt a connection to his Orthodox roots. Ultimately, he developed a view of religion and philosophy, which he called \"private mysticism: Since God was completely unknown and eternally silent, He could be endowed with whatever traits one elected to hang upon Him.\"<ref>Grace Farrell, ''Isaac Bashevis Singer: Conversations'', p. 236, University Press of Mississippi, 1992.</ref>{{Sfn | Singer | 1984 | p = 99}}\n\nSinger was raised Orthodox and learned all the Jewish prayers, studied Hebrew, and learned Torah and Talmud.  As he recounted in the autobiographical short story \"In My Father's Court\", he broke away from his parents in his early twenties. Influenced by his older brother, who had done the same, he began spending time with non-religious Bohemian artists in Warsaw. Although Singer believed in a God, as in traditional Judaism, he stopped attending Jewish religious services of any kind, even on the High Holy Days. He struggled throughout his life with the feeling that a kind and compassionate God would never support the great suffering he saw around him, especially the [[Holocaust]] deaths of so many of the Polish Jews from his childhood. In one interview with the photographer Richard Kaplan, he said, \"I am angry at God because of what happened to my brothers\": Singer's older brother died suddenly in February 1944, in New York, of a [[thrombosis]]; his younger brother perished in Soviet Russia around 1945, after being deported with his mother and wife to Southern [[Kazakhstan]] in Stalin's purges.\n\nDespite the complexities of his religious outlook, Singer lived in the midst of the Jewish community throughout his life. He did not seem to be comfortable unless he was surrounded by Jews; particularly Jews born in Europe. Although he spoke English, [[Hebrew]], and [[Polish language|Polish]] fluently, he always considered [[Yiddish]] his natural tongue. He always wrote in Yiddish and he was the last notable American author to be writing in this language. After he had achieved success as a writer in New York, Singer and his wife began spending time during the winters in Miami with its Jewish community, many of them New Yorkers.\n\nEventually, as senior citizens, they moved to Miami. They identified closely with the European Jewish community. After his death, Singer was buried in a traditional Jewish ceremony in a Jewish cemetery.\n\nEspecially in his short fiction, Singer often wrote about various Jews having religious struggles; sometimes these struggles became violent, bringing death or mental illness. In one story his narrator meets a young woman in New York whom he knew from an Orthodox family in Poland. She has become a kind of hippie, sings American folk music with a guitar, and rejects Judaism, although the narrator comments that in many ways she seems typically Jewish. The narrator says that he often meets Jews who think they are anything but Jewish, and yet still are.\n\nIn the end, Singer remains an unquestionably Jewish writer, yet his precise views about Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish God are open to interpretation. Whatever they were, they lay at the center of his literary art.\n\n===Vegetarianism===\nSinger was a prominent [[Jewish vegetarianism|Jewish vegetarian]]<ref>{{Citation |publisher=IVU |url=http://www.ivu.org/history/northam20b/singer.html |title=History of Vegetarianism |contribution=Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904\u20131991)}}.</ref> for the last 35 years of his life and often included vegetarian themes in his works. In his short story, ''The Slaughterer'', he described the anguish of an appointed slaughterer trying to reconcile his compassion for animals with his job of killing them. He felt that the ingestion of meat was a denial of all ideals and all religions: \"How can we speak of right and justice if we take an innocent creature and shed its blood?\" When asked if he had become a vegetarian for health reasons, he replied: \"I did it for the health of the chickens.\"\n\nIn ''The Letter Writer'', he wrote \"In relation to [animals], all people are Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]].\"{{Sfn | Singer| 1982|p = 271}} which became a classical reference in the discussions about the legitimacy of the [[Animal rights and the Holocaust|comparison of animal exploitation with the Holocaust]].\n\nIn the preface to Steven Rosen's ''Food for Spirit: Vegetarianism and the World Religions'' (1986), Singer wrote, \"When a human kills an animal for food, he is neglecting his own hunger for justice. Man prays for mercy, but is unwilling to extend it to others. Why should man then expect mercy from God? It's unfair to expect something that you are not willing to give. It is inconsistent. I can never accept inconsistency or injustice. Even if it comes from God. If there would come a voice from God saying, \"I'm against vegetarianism!\" I would say, \"Well, I am for it!\" This is how strongly I feel in this regard.\"\n\n===Politics===\nSinger described himself as \"[[conservative]],\" adding that \"I don't believe by flattering the masses all the time we really achieve much.\"<ref>{{Citation |jstor=25304019 |title=Chicago Review |volume=31 |number=4 |date=Spring 1980 |page=57}}</ref> His conservative side was most apparent in his Yiddish writing and journalism, where he was openly hostile to [[Marxist]] sociopolitical agendas. In ''[[Forverts]]'' he once wrote, \"It may seem like terrible ''apikorses'' [heresy], but conservative governments in America, England, France, have handled Jews no worse than liberal governments.... The Jew's worst enemies were always those elements that the modern Jew convinced himself (really hypnotized himself) were his friends.\"{{Sfn | Hadda| 2003|pp = 137\u201338}}<ref name=yivo>{{Citation |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Singer_Isaac_Bashevis |contribution=Singer, Isaac Bashevis |title=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe}}.</ref>\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n*Nobel Prize for Literature, 1978.\n*[[National Book Award|National Book Award (United States)]], 1974 <ref>\n[http://www.nbafictionblog.org/nba-winning-books-blog/1974-1.html 1974] (one of two).</ref>\n*A street in [[Surfside, Florida]] named in his honor.\n*A street in New York City named in his honor (W. 86th st.)\n\n==Published works==\n'''Note:''' Publication dates refer to English editions, not the Yiddish originals, which often predate the versions in translation by 10 to 20 years.\n\n===Novels===\n* ''[[Satan in Goray]]'' (1935)\n* ''Eulogy to a Shoelace''\n* ''[[The Family Moskat]]'' (1950)\n* ''[[The Magician of Lublin (novel)|The Magician of Lublin]]'' (1960)\n* ''[[The Slave (Singer novel)|The Slave]]'' (1962)\n* ''The Manor'' (1967)\n* ''[[The Estate (Singer novel)|The Estate]]'' (1969)\n* ''[[Enemies, a Love Story]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[The Wicked City (Singer novel)|The Wicked City]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Shosha (novel)|Shosha]]'' (1978)\n* ''Old Love'' (1979)\n* ''Reaches of Heaven: A Story of the Baal Shem Tov'' (1980)\n* ''[[The Penitent]]'' (1983)\n* ''Teibele and Her Demon'' (1983) (play)\n* ''The King of the Fields'' (1988)\n* ''Scum'' (1991)\n* ''[[The Certificate]]'' (1992) <ref name=\"oxfordscholarship.com\">[http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195112030.001.0001/acprof-9780195112030-chapter-13 The Perils of Translation: Isaac Bashevis Singer]</ref>\n* ''Meshugah'' (1994)<ref name=\"oxfordscholarship.com\"/>\n* ''[[Shadows on the Hudson]]'' (1997)\n\n===Short story collections===\n* ''Gimpel the Fool and Other Stories'' (1957)\n* ''The Spinoza of Market Street'' (1963)\n* ''Short Friday and Other Stories'' (1963)\n* ''The S\u00e9ance and Other Stories (1968)\n* ''A Friend of Kafka and Other Stories'' (1970)\n* ''The Fools of Chelm and Their History'' (1973)\n* ''[[A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories]]'' (1974) \u2014 shared the National Book Award, Fiction, with ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]]<ref name=nba1974>[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1974.html \"National Book Awards \u2013 1974\"].

Historically, Sunni Islam considers religious authority as being derived from the caliph, who was appointed by the companions of Muhammad at his death. The Sunnis view the Mahdi as the successor of Mohammad; the Mahdi is expected to arrive to rule the world and reestablish righteousness.<ref name=\"Arjomand 2007\">{{cite journal|last=Arjomand|first=Said Amir|title=Islam in Iran vi., the Concept of Mahdi in Sunni Islam|journal=Encyclopaedia Iranica|date=Dec 2007|volume=XIV|issue=Fasc. 2|pages=134\u2013136|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/islam-in-iran-vi-the-concept-of-mahdi-in-sunni-islam}}</ref> Some Sunnis share a belief that there may be no actual Mahdi, but that a series of mujaddid will instead lead to an Islamic revolution of a renewal of faith and avoidance of deviation from God's path.

Ali was appointed the first Imam; and according to [[Twelver]] interpretation, he was followed by eleven more. [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], otherwise known as the Twelfth Imam, went into hiding in 873 at the age of four. His father was [[Hasan al-Askari|al-`Askari]], who had been murdered; and so he was hidden from the authorities of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. He maintained contact with his followers until 940, when he entered [[the Occultation]]. Twelverism believes that al-Mahdi is the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|current Imam]], and will emerge at the end of the current age. Some scholars say that, although unnoticed by others present, the Mahdi of Twelver Islam continues to make an annual pilgrimage while he resides outside of Mecca.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Daniel C.|title=Eschatology|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0223?_hi=0&_pos=1#TheMahd |work=Oxford Islamic Studies |publisher=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islamic Studies (subscription required).}}</ref>  In contradistinction, Sunni Islam foresees him as a separate and new person.<ref name=\"Red\">{{cite book|title=Islam and the Last days|last=Rogers|first=Ed |date=26 Oct 2011 |publisher=Connection Publishing|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00605KLP8/ref=docs-os-doi_0}}</ref> The present Ayatollahs of Iran see themselves as joint caretakers of the office of the Imam until he returns.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aslan |first1=Reza  |authorlink=Reza Aslan |title=[[No god but Allah : the origins, evolution, and future of Islam]] |year=2006 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=1-4000-6213-6}}</ref>\n\nThe Mahdi is not described in the Qur\u02be\u0101n, only in hadith, with scholars suggesting he arose when Arabian tribes were settling in Syria under Muawiya. \"They anticipated 'the Mahdi who will lead the rising people of the Yemen back to their country' in order to restore the glory of their lost Himyarite kingdom.

One of these men, [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]], was said to have judgment and character over rival caliphs; and mysteries of his death arose in the 8th century.  It was believed he had in fact not died and would one day return as the Mahdi.  The sect of Mahdavis arose as followers of another claimant, Muhammad Mahdi of Janpur, in the 15th century.  Furthermore, a potential Mahdi, [[Muhammad Ahmad]] of Sudan, was believed to hold the title following his self-proclamation, in 1881, and stand against the Turco-Egyptian government, as well as the British.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hermansen|first=Marcia|title=Mahdi |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=RELEVANCE&inPS=true&prodId=GVRL&userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&tabID=T003&searchId=R1&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&contentSegment=&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=4&contentSet=GALE%7CCX3403500283&&docId=GALE%7CCX3403500283&docType=GALE |work=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA (subscription required).}}</ref>  Additionally, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] of [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] claimed to be the Mahdi during the same period as Muhammad Ahmad, but was considered a heretic by Orthodox Muslims, though he amassed a substantial following of 10 to 20 million and is credited with founding the [[Ahmadiyya]] sect,<ref name=\"Gale Virtual Reference Library\">{{cite web|last=Waldman|first=Marilyn Robinson|title=Eschatology: Islamic Eschatology |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=RELEVANCE&inPS=true&prodId=GVRL&userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&tabID=T003&searchId=R1&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&contentSegment=&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=2&contentSet=GALE%7CCX3424500949&&docId=GALE%7CCX3424500949&docType=GALE |work=Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA (subscription required).}}</ref> which, today, is established in over 200 countries and territories of the world.\n\nTwo 19th-century religious movements\u2014linked to [[Shia|Shi'ism]], [[B\u00e1bism]], and the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]\u2014believe that their prophets, the [[B\u00e1b]] (d. 1850) and [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]], fulfilled the prophecy. The B\u00e1b is thought to be the return of the Twelfth Imam, who is also the Mahdi according to the twelver tradition, and Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h that of Jesus.

Though Isa is said to descend upon the world once again, the Mahdi will already be present.\n\n:''What will be your reaction when the son of Mary (Jesus) descends and your Imam is from among yourselves?'' (Sahih Muslim, bab nuzul 'isa, Vol. 2; Sahih Bukhari, kitab bad' al-khalq wa nuzul 'isa, Vol. 4)\n\n===Masih ad-Dajjal===\nMasih ad-Dajjal does not appear in the Quran but is a prominent figure in hadith and Islamic eschatology as a whole. He appears gruesome and is blind in his right eye. His one eye is thought to be a symbol that correlates with how single-minded he is in achieving his goal of converting Muslims to his side. Al-Dajjal has the intention of gaining followers through his miracle working and apparent wealth and generosity. To resist such munificence is a test for true believers of Islam, who have been warned about Al-Dajjal's power, and who must resist his material temptations. It is thought that Al-Dajjal will appear prior to the Day of Judgment, where he will engage in an epic battle with, and be killed by, Jesus. Al-Dajjal functions symbolically as a key cog in the overall Islamic eschatological picture, which emphasises the world coming to an end, of good finally triumphing over evil, and of the remarkable events that will prefigure the replacement of the mortal world with a more authentic form of existence in the afterlife. Various Muslim political movements use the concept of Al-Dajjal to comment on contemporary events, and often identify him with opposing regimes or other worldly forces that they consider as harmful to Islam.<ref>{{cite web|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=Dajj\u0101l, Al-|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e1018?_hi=3&_pos=2|work=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|publisher=Oxford University Press (subscription required).}}</ref>\n\n===Ya'juj and Ma'juj===\n{{main article|Gog and Magog}}\nThe fourth major sign of the end time will be that the wall which imprisons the nations of [[Gog and Magog|Ya'juj and Ma'juj]] will break, and they will surge forth.

In Islamic tradition, Iblis is often identified with ''[[Shaitan|Al-Shaitan]]'' (\"the Devil\").

More often occurs the term [[Shaitan]], that is, sometimes related to Iblis. The different fragments of Iblis' story are scattered over the Quran, comprised it can be summed up as the following<ref>Peter J. Awn ''Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Ibl\u012bs in Sufi Psychology'' BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 18</ref>:\n\nThen God created Adam, He ordered all the [[angels in Islam|angels]] to bow before the new creation. All the angels bowed down, but Iblis refused to do so. He argued that since he himself was created from fire, he is superior to humans, made from mud, and that he should not prostrate himself before Adam.<ref>{{cite quran|7|12|s=ns}}</ref> For his haughtiness, he was banished from heaven and condemned to hell. Therefore, Iblis made a request for the ability to try to mislead Adam and his descendants. God grants his request but also warned that he will have no power over God's servants.<ref>{{cite quran|17|65|s=ns|q=\"As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have over them:\" Enough is thy Lord for a Disposer of affairs.}}</ref>\n\n===Sufism===\n[[Sufism]] developed an unusual perspective of Iblis' refusal and regard [[Muhammed in Islam|Muhammed]] and Iblis as the two true monotheists. Therefore, some Sufis hold, Iblis refused to bow to Adam because he was fully devoted to God alone and refused to bow to anyone else. By weakening the evil in the satanic figure, dualism is also degraded, that corresponds with the [[Sufi cosmology]] of [[unity of opposites|unity of existence]] rejecting [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] tendecies. The belief in dualism or that ''Evil'' is caused by something else than God, even if only by one's own will, is regarded as ''[[shirk]]'' by some Sufis.<ref>Peter J. Awn ''Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Ibl\u012bs in Sufi Psychology'' BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 104</ref> For Iblis' preference to be dammed to hell, than prostrating himself before someone else other than the \"Beloved\" (here referring to God), Iblis also became an example for [[unrequited love]].\n\nA famous narration about an encounter between [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] and Iblis  on the slopes of [[Sinai]], told by [[Mansur al-Hallaj]], [[Ruzbihan Baqli]]<ref>Peter J. Awn ''Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Ibl\u012bs in Sufi Psychology'' BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 104</ref> and [[Ghazzali]], emphasizes the nobility of Iblis. Accordingly, Moses asks Iblis why he refused God's order. Iblis replied that the command was actually a test. Then Moses replied, obviously Iblis was punished by being turned from an angel to a [[shaitan|devil]]. Iblis responds, his form is just temporary and his love towards God remains the same.<ref>Richard Gramlich ''Der eine Gott: Grundz\u00fcge der Mystik des islamischen Monotheismus'' Otto Harrassowitz Verlag 1998 {{ISBN|978-3-447-04025-9}} page 44</ref><ref>Joseph E.

[[Rumi]]'s viewpoint on Iblis is much more in tune with Islamic orthodoxy. Rumi views Iblis as the manifestation of the [[Seven deadly sins|great sins]] [[pride|haughtiness]] and [[envy]]. He states: \"(Cunning) intelligence is from Iblis, and love from Adam.\"<ref>Annemarie Schimmel The Triumphal Sun: A Study of the Works of Jalaloddin Rumi Annemarie Schimmel SUNY Press 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-791-41635-8}} page 255</ref> Iblis represents the principle of  \"one-eyed\" intellect; he only saw the outward earthly form of Adam, but was blind to the Divine spark hidden in him, using an illicit method of comparison.<ref>Wal\u012b All\u0101h al-Dihlaw\u012b ''Sh\u0101h Wal\u012b All\u0101h of Delhi's Hujjat All\u0101h Al-b\u0101ligha'' BRILL 1996 {{ISBN|978-9-004-10298-9}} page 350</ref> [[Hasan of Basra]] holds that Iblis was the first who used \"analogy\", comparing himself to someone else, this causing his sin. Iblis therefore also represents humans' psyche moving towards sin or shows how love can cause envy and anxiety losing a beloved one.<ref>Jal\u0101l ad-D\u012bn Muhammad R\u016bm\u012b, Rumi ''Collected Poetical Works of Rumi (Delphi Classics)'' Delphi Classics 2015 story XI</ref>\n\n=== Affilation ===\n[[File:Adam and the Angels watched by Iblis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Illustration from an Arabic manuscript of the ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings|Annals of al-Tabari]]'' showing Iblis refusing to prostrate before the newly created Adam]]\nIslam differs in regard of Iblis' nature. For some scholars such as [[Tabari]], [[Ash'ari]],<ref>Miguel Asin Palacios ''Islam and the Divine Comedy'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-134-53643-6}} page 109</ref> and [[Al-Baydawi]]<ref>Stephen J. Vicchio ''Biblical Figures in the Islamic Faith'' Wipf and Stock Publishers 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-556-35304-8}} page 183</ref> regard him as an angel. Tabari argued for an angelic origin of Iblis in his  [[Tafsir al-Tabari|tafsir]]: <blockquote>\"The reason people held this opinion [that Iblis was not an angel] is that God stated in His Book that He created Iblis from the fire of the Samum (15:27) and from smokeless fire (55:15), but did not state  that He created the angels from any like of that. And God states he was of the jinn, so they said that it is not possible that he should be related to that which God does not relate him to; they said that Iblis had progeny and offspring, but the angels do not procreate or have children.\n\n(. .)\n\nBut these reasons only bespeak the weakness of these people's knowledge, for there is nothing objectionable in that God should have created the categories of His angels from all kinds of things that He had created: He created some of them from light, some of them from fire, and some of them from what He willed apart from that. There sis thus nothing in God's omitting to state what He created His angels from what He created His angels from, and in His stating what He created Iblis from, which necessarily implies that Iblis is outside of the meaing of [angel], for it is possible that He created a category of His angels, among whom was Iblis, from fire, and even that Iblis was unique in that He created him, and no other angels of His, from the fire of the Samum.\nLikewise, he cannot be excluded from being an angel by fact that he had progeny or offspring , beause passion and lust, from which the other angels were free, was compounded in him when God willed disobedience in him. As for God's statement that he was <one of the jinn>, it is not to be rejected that everything which hides itself (ijtanna) from the sight is a 'jinn', . . . and Iblis and the angels should then be among them, because they hide themselves from the eyes of mankind.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn the other hand, the Quranexegete [[Ibn Kathir]], prefered to regard him as a jinni, an opinnion shared by scholars such as Hasan of Basra, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]],<ref>Mahmoud M. Ayoub ''Qur'an and Its Interpreters, The, Volume 1, Band 1'' SUNY Press {{ISBN|978-0-791-49546-9}} page 86</ref> and [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Al-Munajjid]], stating in his tafsir:\n<blockquote>\n\"When Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Iblis was included in this command. Although Iblis was not an angel, he was trying- and pretending - to imitate the angels' behavior and deeds, and this is why he was also included in the command to the angels to prostrate before Adam. Satan was criticized for defying that command, (. . .)\n\n(So they prostrated themselves except Iblis. He was one of the Jinn;) meaning, his original nature betrayed him. He had been created from smokeless fire, whereas the angels had been created from light, (. . .)\n\nWhen matters crucial every vessel leaks that which to contains and is betrayed by its true nature. Iblis used to do, what the angels did and resembled them in their devotion and worship, so he was included when they were addressed, but he disobeyed and went what he was told to do. So Allah points out here that he was one of the Jinn, he was created from fire, as He says elsewhere.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe theological viewpoints can be summarized as follows:<ref>Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} page 135</ref>\n* Iblis is from a type of angel, who was created from fire..<ref>Stephen J. Vicchio ''Biblical Figures in the Islamic Faith'' Wipf and Stock Publishers 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-556-35304-8}} page 183</ref>\n* Iblis is a jinni differing from the angels, who are made out of light.\n* Once an angel, Iblis turned into a Jinn by his act of disobedience.\n\n== Iconography ==\n[[File:Iblis_with_turban.jpg|thumb|right|Another painting of angels prostrating before Adam with Iblis refusing, here depicted with a headcover]]\nIllustrations of Iblis in Islamic paintings often depict him black-faced, a feature which would later symbolize any Satanic figure or heretic, and with a black body, to symbolize his corrupted nature. Another common depiction of Iblis shows him wearing special headcovering, clearly different from the traditional Islamic turban. In one painting however, Iblis wears a traditional Islamic headcovering.<ref>Na'ama Brosh, Rachel Milstein, Muze\u02bcon Yi\u015bra\u02bcel (Jerusalem) ''Biblical stories in Islamic painting'' Israel Museum 1991 page 27</ref> The turban probably refers to a narration of Iblis' fall: there he wore a turban, then he was sent down from heaven.<ref>A\u1e25mad ibn Mu\u1e25ammad Tha\u02bblab\u012b, William M.

He may either be a [[fallen angel]] or a [[jinni]] or something entirely unique. These contradictions arise from the Quran itself<ref>Tobias N\u00fcnlist ''D\u00e4monenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 51 (German)</ref>, while Iblis is included into the command adressed to the angels and appearently among them, he is identified as a ''jinni'' ('\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0650\u0646\u0650\u0651') in Surah {{cite quran|18|50|s=ns|b=n}}. This combined with the fact, he himself boasts to be created from fire (nar), suggests that he is not angel but a jinni, since according to ''[[hadith]]'' the angels are created from ''light'' (nur) and the jinn from ''fire'' (nar). But the term ''jinni'' itself is ambiguous. In [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] the term denoted any type of invisible creature including angels known from [[Arab Christians]], [[Arab Jews]] and [[Zoroastrianism|Zorastrians]].<ref>Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 34</ref> Additionally, the Quran does not mention ''light'' as a speparate source from which the angels are supposed to be created. Otherwise in [[Ancient Near East]]ern traditions, the nature of angels was associated with fire, therefore Iblis could indeed be intended to represent an angel, such as a [[Seraphim]].<ref>Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02bc\u0101n'' BRILL 2003 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} Band 3 p. 46</ref> \n\nOtherwise, the nature of the jinn in later Islamic tradition is not always clear either. Some hold the jinn to be a sub-category of \"fiery angels\" who are guardians of ''[[Jannah|jannah]]'', differing from the earthly jinn, who are like monsters or demons. Accordingly they are named 'Jinni', because of their relation to heaven.<ref>Roger Allen ''Studying Modern Arabic Literature'' Edinburgh University Press 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-474-40349-8}} Notes </ref><ref>Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} page 135</ref> On the other hand, in another story, the earthen jinn themselves are related to angels. Therefore, they were sent down to earth to experience bodily pleassure and although they remained obedient towards God during the beginning, they later found themselves lost in wars, bloodshed, and other unjust deeds. Iblis, disgusted from his fellow beings, prayed for his return to heaven until his prayers were answered.<ref>M.J. KISTER ADAM: ''A STUDY OF SOME LEGENDS IN TAFSIR AND HADIT LITERATURE'' Approaches to the History 0f the Interpretation of The Qur'an, Oxford 1988 S. 129</ref>\n\nAssuming Iblis was one of the jinn, who differ from the angels, scholars tried to explain his stay among the angels. According to a narrative provided by [[Ibn Kathir]], Iblis was once an ordinary earthly creature, but, due to his piety and constant worship, elevated among the angels. He lived there for thousand of years, until his non-angelic origin was forgotten and only God remembered Iblis' true identity. To reveal his haughtiness, God commanded the angels, Iblis, due to his rank among the angels included, to prostrate himself before Adam. But Iblis refused, thus his own nature betrayed him, leading to his downfall.<ref>Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman ''Tafsir Ibn Kathir Juz' 1 (Part 1): Al-Fatihah 1 to Al-Baqarah 141 2nd Edition'' MSA Publication Limited 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-861-79826-8}} page 136</ref>\n\nOther scholars, such as [[Hasan of Basra]] and  [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], do not provide an explanation for his abode among the angels. In this case, his stay in heaven is self explanatory, because every creature is created in heaven first. Here, although created in heaven, Iblis is not regarded as an angel, but the equivalent father of the jinn, compared to what Adam is to humanity. Iblis, as the father of the jinn, was cast out of heaven due to his own sin, just as Adam was banished after his corresponding transgression of God's orders not to eat from the [[Forbidden fruit|Forbidden Tree]].\n\nThose scholars, who argue against Iblis' angelic origin also refer to his progeny, since, angels do not procreate in Islam, pointing at {{cite quran|18|51|s=ns|b=n}}. [[List of Islamic studies scholars|Islamic study scholar]] [[Fritz Meier]] also insist, that the Islamic Iblis can not be hold as an angel, since angels have no progeny by definition.<ref>Tobias N\u00fcnlist ''D\u00e4monenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 54 (German)</ref> Otherwise [[Walther Eickmann]] argued that the ''progeny of Iblis'' does not correspond with \"progeny\" in a literal sense, but just refers to the cohorts of Iblis.<ref>Walther Eickmann ''Die Angelologie und D\u00e4monologie des Korans im Vergleich zu der Engel- und Geisterlehre der Heiligen Schrift'' Eger 1908 p. 27 (german)</ref>  Actually, according to some Islamic traditions, Iblis is indeed an asexuel being just like the other angels.<ref>Abdelwahab Bouhdiba ''Sexuality in Islam'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-135-03037-7}} page 59</ref> On the other hand, he occures as a hermaphrodite creature, whose children split from himselfor that he lays eggs, that is characteristical for [[Shayatin]] (demons).<ref>Tobias N\u00fcnlist ''D\u00e4monenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p.53-54 (German)</ref> The Quran exegete [[Tabari]] however, who defends Iblis' angelic origin,<ref>Brannon M. Wheeler ''Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis'' A&C Black, 18.06.2002 page 16 {{ISBN|978-0-826-44957-3}}</ref> asserts, that Iblis did not procreate until he lost his angelic state and became a demon. Therefore, the fact Iblis has progeny could not exclude him from an angelic origin.\n\nAnother central argument to determine Iblis essence, also relating to his theological significance, deals with his disobedience. Since according to Islam, angels are merely God's servants, Iblis' disobedience speaks against his angelic nature, as oppnents of Iblis' angelic origin argue.<ref>Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 46</ref> Unlike the angels, he was endowed with the ability to choose, but he decided to disobey due to his own arrogance. His nature to disregard God is thought of a part of the free-will given to jinn. On the otherhand, scholars who adhere to Iblis' angelic nature, do not regard him as ''free''. Actually Iblis is seen as just another instrument of God, a tester who acts within God's plan.<ref>Ludo Abicht ''Islam & Europe: Challenges and Opportunities'' Leuven University Press 2008 {{ISBN|978-9-058-67672-6}} page 128</ref><ref>Peter J.

Awn ''Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Ibl\u012bs in Sufi Psychology'' BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 104</ref> Therefore, his disobedience was in accordance with God's will. The reason, why he choose to refuse the command, unlike the other angels, is tried to be explained by several narrations. According to one, Iblis, as the teachers of the angels, was more knowledgeable than the others and knew about a command, not to prostrate himself, when all the other angels do.<ref>Peter J.

Knowing about Adams future, he was no longer able to prostrate himself. However, this narrative is more unconvincing, since other angels protested alike, knowing about the corruption.<ref>Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 45</ref> In another explanation, Iblis is endowed with the task to seduce humans, comparable to other angels, such as [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]] is endowed with the transmission of revelation,<ref>Peter J. Awn Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Ibl\u012bs in Sufi Psychology BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 97</ref> and created for this purpose from fire differing from the other angels.<ref>Peter J.

He was the teacher of the other angels, and God gave him authority over the lower heavens. When the jinn increasingly caused corruption on earth, God sent him with an army of angels to battle the jinn and they drove them into the [[Mount Qaf|mountains]]. Iblis felt superior to any other creature, especially since he was, unlike the other angels, created from fire. Then God created Adam and commanded the angels to prostrate before him, Iblis felt humiliated, and refused to accept the superiority of man, who was, according to Iblis, just another fallible entity, who would corrupt God's earth, like the jinn he just defeated before, while he would ''praise God's glory day and night''.<ref>James William Hampson Stobart ''Islam & Its Founder'' Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge 1876 digitized 2006 original: Oxford University page 114</ref> Therefore, he was cast out of heaven, but God allows him to proof Iblis objection concerning humanity by tempting them into sin, and gave him a chance to redeem himself.<ref>Jamal J.

One of these was Iblis, who grew up among the angels in heaven, and because of his piety was elevated to their rank, however remaining a jinn but gaining the shape of an angel. When God ordered the angels and Iblis to prostrate themselves before Adam, Iblis abused his free-will and refused haughtily, considering himself superior because of his physical nature constituted of fire and not of clay.<ref>Ali Unal ''The Qur'an with Annotated Interpretation in Modern English'' Tughra Books 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-597-84144-3}} page 29</ref>Therefore, he was damned to hell but was given respite until the Day of Judgment.\n\n===Iblis and the serpent===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   = \n| width     = \n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Expulsion_from_'the_Garden'.jpg\n| width1    = 200\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Painting of the expulsion from \"The Garden\" by Al-Hakim Nishapuri.The main actors of the narration about Adams fall are drawn: Adam, Hawwa (Eve), Iblis, the serpent, the peacock and an Angel, probably [[Ridwan (name)|Ridwan]], who guards paradise.\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Adam and Eve from a copy of the Falnama.jpg\n| width2    = 216\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = This painting is coming from a copy of the F\u0101ln\u0101meh (Book of Omens) ascribed to Ja\u00b4far al-S\u0101diq.

Then Iblis invents a plan to trick the guardian. He approaches a peacock and tells him that all creatures will die and the peacock's beauty will perish.  But if he gets the fruit of eternity, every creature will last forever. Therefore, the peacock convinces the serpent to slip Iblis into the Garden, by carrying him in his mouth. In the Garden, Iblis speaks through the serpent to Adam and Eve, and tricks them into eating from the forbidden tree.

In the U.S., satellite operators such as [[PanAmSat]], Orion Communications, Columbia Communications, Iridium, Globalstar, TRW and others formed under the umbrella of the Alliance for Competitive International Satellite Services (ACISS) to press for an end to the IGOs and the monopoly position of [[COMSAT]] the US signatory to Intelsat and Inmarsat.

In April 1998, to address US government concerns about market power, Intelsat's senior management spun off five of its older satellites to a private Dutch entity, [[New Skies Satellites]], which became a direct competitor to Intelsat.  To avert the US government's interference with Intelsat, Intelsat's senior management unsuccessfully considered relocating the IGO to another country.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n===Privatisation===\nOn 18 July 2001, Intelsat became a private company, 37 years after formation. Prior to Intelsat's privatisation in 2001, ownership and investment in INTELSAT (measured in shares) was distributed among INTELSAT members according to their use of services. Investment shares determined each member\u2019s percentage of the total contribution needed to finance capital expenditures. The organisation\u2019s primary source of revenue was satellite usage fees which, after deduction of operating costs, was redistributed to INTELSAT members in proportion to their shares as repayment of capital and compensation for use of capital.

Before that epoch, the [[Brahmi numeral]] system was in use; that system did not encompass the concept of the place-value of numbers. Instead, Brahmi numerals included additional symbols for the tens, as well as separate symbols for ''hundred'' and ''thousand''.\n\nThe Indian place-system numerals  spread to neighboring [[Persia]], where they were picked up by the conquering [[Arab]]s. In 662, [[Severus Sebokht]] - a [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] bishop living in Syria wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I will omit all discussion of the science of the Indians ...  of their subtle discoveries in astronomy \u2014 discoveries that are more ingenious than those of the Greeks and the Babylonians - and of their valuable methods of calculation which surpass description. I wish only to say that this computation is done by means of nine signs. If those who believe that because they speak Greek they have arrived at the limits of science would read the Indian texts they would be convinced even if a little late in the day that there are others who know something of value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/PrintHT/Arabic_numerals.html|title=Arabic numerals|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe addition of [[0 (number)|zero]] as a tenth positional digit is documented from the 7th century by [[Brahmagupta]], though the earlier [[Indian mathematics#Bakhshali Manuscript|Bakhshali Manuscript]], written sometime before the 5th century, also included zero. But it is in [[Khmer numerals]] of modern [[Cambodia]] where the first extant material evidence of [[Zero#Zero as a decimal digit|zero as a numerical figure]], dating its use back to the seventh century, is found.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New zeroes and Old Khmer |first=Anthony |last=Diller |publisher=Australian National University |year=1996 |url=http://www.lc.mahidol.ac.th/Documents/Publication/MKS/25/diller1996new.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220013805/http://www.lc.mahidol.ac.th/Documents/Publication/MKS/25/diller1996new.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-20 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAs it was from the Arabs that the Europeans learned this system, the Europeans called them ''[[Arabic numerals]];'' the Arabs refer to their numerals as ''Indian numerals''. In academic circles they{{which|date=August 2018}} are called the ''Hindu\u2013Arabic'' or ''Indo\u2013Arabic'' numerals.\n\nThe significance of the development of the positional number system is probably best described by the French mathematician [[Laplace|Pierre Simon Laplace]] (1749\u20131827) who wrote:\n\n<blockquote>It is India that gave us the ingenious method of expressing all numbers by the means of ten symbols, each symbol receiving a value of position, as well as an absolute value; a profound and important idea which appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit, but its very simplicity, the great ease which it has lent to all computations, puts our arithmetic in the first rank of useful inventions, and we shall appreciate the grandeur of this achievement when we remember that it escaped the genius of Archimedes and Apollonius, two of the greatest minds produced by antiquity.</blockquote>\n\n[[Tobias Dantzig]]<ref>The father of [[George Dantzig]].</ref> had this to say in ''Number'':<ref>{{citation|first=Tobias|last=Dantzig|title=Number / The Language of Science|edition=4th|year=1954|publisher=The Free Press (Macmillan)|isbn=0-02-906990-4|pages=29\u201330}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qvnjXOCjv7EC&pg=PA197 Geometry] By Roger Fenn, Springer, 2001</ref>\n\n<blockquote>This long period of nearly five thousand years saw the rise and fall of many civilizations, each leaving behind a heritage of literature, art, philosophy, and religion. But what was the net achievement in the field of reckoning, the earliest art practiced by man? An inflexible numeration so crude as to make progress well nigh impossible, and a calculating device so limited in scope that even elementary calculations called for the services of an expert. [...] man used these devices for thousands of years [...] without contributing a single important idea to the system!\n    [...] even when compared with the slow growth of ideas during the Dark Ages, the history of reckoning presents a peculiar picture of desolate stagnation.\n    When viewed in this light, the achievements of the unknown Hindu, who some time in the first centuries of our era discovered the ''principle of position'' assumes the importance of a world event.</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Western Arabic numerals]]\n* [[Eastern Arabic numerals]]\n* [[Bengali-Assamese numerals]]\n* [[Tamil numerals]]\n* [[Sinhala numerals]]\n* [[Indian Numbering System|Indian numbering system]]\n* [[Khmer numerals]]\n* [[Burmese numerals]]\n* [[Thai numerals]]\n* [[Lao alphabet#Numerals|Lao numerals]]\n* [[Javanese numerals]]\n* [[Balinese numerals]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Indian numerals}}\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n;Sources\n*Georges Ifrah, ''The Universal History of Numbers.''

Botham''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 24 November 1955) is an English former [[cricket]]er and current [[sports commentator|cricket commentator]]. Widely regarded as one of the greatest [[all-rounder]]s in cricket history,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/14265/10668803/100-greatest-cricketers-sir-ian-botham-included-in-players-20-11||title=100 Greatest Cricketers: Sir Ian Botham included in players 20-11|date=30 November 2016|first=Benedict|last=Bermange|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]}}</ref> Botham represented [[England cricket team|England]] in both Test and One-Day International cricket. He played most of his first-class cricket for [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]], and also for [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]], [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] and [[Queensland cricket team|Queensland]]. He was an aggressive right-handed [[batting (cricket)|batsman]] and, as a right arm [[fast bowling|fast-medium bowler]], was noted for his [[swing bowling]]. He generally [[fielding (cricket)|fielded]] close to the [[wicket]], predominantly [[slip (cricket)|in the slips]]. In Test cricket, Botham scored 14 [[century (cricket)|centuries]] with a highest score of 208, and from 1986 to 1988, he held the world record for the most Test wickets until overtaken by fellow all-rounder [[Sir Richard Hadlee]]. He took five wickets in an innings 27 times and 10 wickets in a match four times. In 1980, he became the second player in Test history to complete the \"match double\" of scoring 100 runs and taking 10 wickets in the same match.\n\nBotham has at times been involved in controversy including a highly publicised court case involving rival all-rounder [[Imran Khan]] and an ongoing dispute with the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] (RSPB). These incidents, allied to his on-field success, have attracted media attention, especially from the tabloid press. Botham has made effective use of the fame given to him by the publicity because he is actively concerned about [[leukaemia]] in children and has undertaken several long distance walks to raise money for research into the disease. These efforts have been highly successful and have realised millions of [[pound sterling|pounds]] for [[Bloodwise]], of which he became president. In recognition of his services to [[charity (practice)|charity]], he was awarded a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] in the 2007 New Years Honours List. On 8 August 2009, he was inducted into the [[ICC Cricket Hall of Fame]].\n\nBotham has a wide range of sporting interests outside cricket. He was a talented [[association football|footballer]] at school and had to choose between cricket and football as a career. He chose cricket but, even so, he did play professional football for a few seasons and made eleven appearances in [[the Football League]] for [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]]. He is a keen [[golf]]er and his other pastimes include [[angling]] and [[shooting]].\n\n==Early life and development as a cricketer (1955\u20131973)==\nIan Botham was born in [[Heswall]], [[Cheshire]], to Herbert Leslie (\"Les\") Botham and Violet Marie, {{n\u00e9e}} Collett.<ref name=\"doust33\">Doust (1981), p. 33.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/education/2007/12/15/fadet115.xml |title=Family detective: Sir Ian Botham |last=Barratt |first=Nick |work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=15 December 2007 |accessdate=28 August 2009}}</ref> His father had been in the [[Fleet Air Arm]] for twenty years spanning the [[World War II|Second World War]]; his mother was a nurse. The family moved to [[Yeovil]] before Botham's third birthday after his father got a job as a test engineer at [[Westland Helicopters]].<ref name=WCY78/><ref name=\"doust33\"/> Both his parents played cricket: his father for Westland Sports Club while his mother captained a nursing services team at [[Sherborne]].<ref>Farmer (1979), p. 52.</ref> Botham developed an eagerness for the game before he had started school: he would climb through the fence of the Yeovil Boys' Grammar School to watch the pupils play cricket. At the age of around four, he came home with a cricket ball and asked his mother \"Do you know how to hold a ball when you're going to bowl a daisy-cutter?\" He subsequently demonstrated the grip and went away to practise bowling it.<ref>Murphy (1988), p. 12.</ref> \n\nBotham attended Milford Junior School in the town and it was there that his \"love affair\" with sport began. He played both cricket and football for the school's teams at the age of nine; two years earlier than most of his contemporaries.<ref>Doust (1981), p. 34.</ref><ref name=\"botham 36-37\">{{cite book |last=Botham| first=Ian |title=Botham: My Autobiography |publisher=CollinsWillow |year=1994 |pages=36\u201337 |chapter=A Bouncing Baby Botham |isbn = 0-00-218316-1}}</ref> Playing against the older boys forced Botham to learn to hit the ball hard, and improve to their standard. At the same age he went to matches with his father, who played for Westland Sports Club, and if one of the teams was short, he would try to get a match. His father recalled that though he never got to bowl, and rarely got to bat, he received praise for the standard of his fielding.<ref>Murphy (1988), pp. 12\u201314.</ref> He joined the [[Boys' Brigade]] where more sporting opportunities were available.<ref name=WCY78/> By the time he was nine, he had begun to \"haunt\" local recreation grounds with his kit always ready, looking to play for any team that was short of players.<ref name=WCY78/> By the age of twelve he was playing occasional matches for Yeovil Cricket Club's second team.<ref>Murphy (1988), p. 15.</ref>\n\nBotham went on to [[Bucklers Mead Community School|Bucklers Mead Comprehensive School]] where he continued to do well in sport and played for the school's cricket and football teams. He became captain of their under-16 cricket team when he was thirteen. His performances for the school drew the attention of [[Somerset County Cricket Club]]'s youth coach [[Bill Andrews (cricketer)|Bill Andrews]]. Still thirteen, he scored 80 runs on debut for Somerset's under-15s side against Wiltshire, but the team captain [[Phil Slocombe]] did not call on him to bowl as he considered him to be a specialist batsman.<ref>Doust (1981), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Two years later, Botham had the opportunity to choose between football and cricket: [[Bert Head]], manager of [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] offered him apprentice forms with the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club.<ref>Doust (1981), pp. 38\u201339.</ref> He already had a contract with Somerset and, after discussing the offer with his father, decided to continue to pursue a cricket career, as he believed he was a better cricketer.<ref>Murphy (1988), pp. 16\u201317.</ref> When informed that he wanted to be a sportsman, Botham's careers teacher said to him: \"Fine, everyone wants to play sport, but what are you really going to do?\"<ref name=TC>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkcricket.co.uk/guides/cricket_legends_sir_ian_botham.html |title=Talk Cricket |publisher=Fubra Limited |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lord's Pavilion.jpg|thumb|right|The pavilion at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]], where Botham served as a ground boy in 1972 and 1973.]]\nIn 1972, at the age of 16, Botham left school intent on playing cricket for Somerset, who retained his contract but felt he was too young to justify a full professional deal.<ref>Murphy (1988), pp. 18\u201319.</ref> So, Botham joined the ground staff at [[Lord's]].<ref>Doust (1981), p. 39.</ref> As a ground boy, he had numerous tasks such as \"cleaning the pavilion windows, pushing the roller on matchdays, selling scorecards, pressing electronic buttons on the scoreboards and rushing bowling analyses to the dressing-room\".<ref>Murphy (1988), pp. 22\u201323.</ref> He also received coaching and plenty of time in the practice nets, and was often the first to arrive and the last to leave practice.<ref>Murphy (1988), p. 22.</ref> Despite his time in the nets, Botham was only considered by [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) coach [[Harry Sharp]] to have the potential to become a \"good, average county cricketer.\"<ref name=\"doust41\">Doust (1981), p. 41.</ref> Botham travelled to play for Somerset under-25s a number of times during the season, but failed to excel in any of the matches. His appearances for the MCC were of a similar vein: he rarely scored more than 50 runs, and was used sparingly as a bowler.<ref name=\"doust41\"/> In one such match against \"Scotland A\", the MCC Young Cricketers used eight bowlers in their second innings, but Botham was not among them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/32/32705.html |title=Marylebone Cricket Club Young Cricketers v Scotland A: Scotland A in England 1972 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, still a ground boy at Lord's, Botham was asked to return to play for Somerset's under-25s more often. Against [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan U-25]], he scored 91 runs and took three [[Batting order (cricket)#Lower order or tail|tail-end]] wickets,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/33/33368.html |title=Somerset Under-25s v Glamorgan Under-25s: Under-25 County Cricket Competition 1973 (Western Zone) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> while just under a month later he claimed a further three wickets against Hampshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/33/33526.html |title=Somerset Under-25s v Hampshire Under-25s: Under-25 County Cricket Competition 1973 (Western Zone) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> He advanced to play for the county's second team in the [[Minor Counties Cricket Championship|Minor Counties Championship]], and although he was still used sparingly as a bowler, he made some good scores with the bat, most significantly against [[Cornwall County Cricket Club|Cornwall]], against whom he aggregated 194 runs in four innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/93/93607.html |title=Cornwall v Somerset Second XI: Minor Counties Championship 1973 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/93/93667.html |title=Somerset Second XI v Cornwall: Minor Counties Championship 1973 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> During winter nets prior to the season, Botham had caught the eye of the former [[England cricket team|England]] Test cricketer [[Tom Cartwright]], who coached at [[Millfield School]] in addition to playing for Somerset. Cartwright was impressed with Botham's foot-work and physical co-ordination, and helped him learn the basics of [[swing bowling]], something Botham picked up \"astonishly quickly\" according to Cartwright.<ref>Murphy (1988), p. 24.</ref>\n\n==Cricket career (1973\u20131993)==\n===Somerset (1973\u20131975)===\nBotham had done well for the Second XI and he later acknowledged the help and advice he received from Somerset players [[Peter Robinson (cricketer)|Peter Robinson]], [[Graham Burgess (cricketer)|Graham Burgess]] and [[Ken Palmer]].<ref name=WCY78/> Botham made his senior debut, aged 17, for [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] on Sunday, 2 September 1973 when he played in a [[List A cricket|List A]] [[Pro40|John Player League]] (JPL) match (38 [[over (cricket)|overs]] each) against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] at the [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|County Ground, Hove]].<ref>Murphy (1988) p. 24.</ref> The match was in the same week that his time on the Lord's ground staff was completed.<ref>Doust (1981), p. 42.</ref> Somerset [[batting (cricket)|batted]] first and Botham, number seven in the batting order, scored two [[run (cricket)|runs]] before he was [[dismissal (cricket)|dismissed]] [[leg before wicket]] (lbw) by [[Mike Buss]].

Botham [[bowling (cricket)|bowled]] three overs without success, conceding 22 runs. He did impress, however, by taking a diving [[caught|catch]] to dismiss his future [[England cricket team|England]] colleague [[Tony Greig]] off the bowling of his [[captain (cricket)|captain]] [[Brian Close]].<ref>Murphy (1988), pp. 24\u201325.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/33/33763.html |title=Sussex v Somerset (JPL), 1973 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nA week later, Botham made a second appearance in the JPL against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] at [[The Oval]] in the final match of the season.

[[Viv Richards]], from [[Antigua and Barbuda]], made his County Championship d\u00e9but for Somerset in the same match and Lancashire's team included [[Clive Lloyd]], two players who would loom large in Botham's future Test career. Brian Close won the toss and decided to bat first. On day one, Somerset were all out for 285 and Lancashire reached 41 for none. Botham batted at number seven and scored 13 before being [[caught]]. Day two was rain-affected and Lancashire advanced to 200 for none. Their innings closed on the final day at 381 for eight. Botham bowled only three overs and his figures were none for 15; he held one catch to dismiss [[Jack Simmons (cricketer)|Jack Simmons]]. Somerset played for the draw and were 104 for two at the end. Botham did not bat again.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/34/34122.html |title=Somerset v Lancashire (CC), 1974 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 June 1974, he played against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] at Taunton in a [[Benson & Hedges Cup]] (B&H Cup) quarter-final. Hampshire won the toss and decided to bat. They scored 182 all out with Botham taking two for 33 including the prize wicket of [[Barry Richards]], bowled for 13. Botham was number nine in Somerset's batting order and came in with his team struggling at 113 for 7. Almost immediately, that became 113 for 8 and he had only the [[tailender]]s [[Hallam Moseley]] and [[Bob Clapp]] to support him. He was facing the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indian]] [[fast bowling|fast bowler]] [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]] who delivered a [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] which hit him in the mouth. Despite heavy bleeding and the eventual loss of four teeth, Botham refused to leave the field and carried on batting. He hit two sixes and made 45[[not out|*]], enabling Somerset to win by one wicket.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/34/34289.html |title=Somerset v Hampshire (B&H Q/F), 1974 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref> He won the [[man of the match|Gold Award]]. Later, he said he should have left the field but was full of praise for Moseley and Clapp.<ref name=WCY78/>\n\nIn a County Championship match on 13 July 1974, Botham scored his first half-century in first-class cricket. He made 59 in Somerset's first innings against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] at Taunton, the highest individual score in a low-scoring match which Somerset won by 73 runs. Middlesex's captain was [[Mike Brearley]], who would become a very influential figure in Botham's career.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/34/34447.html |title=Somerset v Middlesex (CC), 1974 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> A month later, in a match against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] at [[Clarence Park, Weston-super-Mare]], Botham achieved his first-ever five wickets in an innings (5wI) with five for 59. He took seven in the match which Somerset won by 179 runs, largely thanks to Close who scored 59 and 114*.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/34/34609.html |title=Somerset v Leicestershire (CC), 1974 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nBotham showed great promise in 1974, his first full season in which Somerset finished fifth in the County Championship and a close second to Leicestershire in the JPL. They also reached the semi-finals in both the [[Friends Provident Trophy|Gillette Cup]] and the B&H Cup. In 18 first-class appearances, Botham scored 441 runs with a highest of 59, took 30 first-class wickets with a best of five for 59 and held 15 catches.<ref name=CAbatFC>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1529/f_Batting_by_Season.html |title=First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Ian Botham |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=CAballFC>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1529/f_Bowling_by_Season.html |title=First-class Bowling in Each Season by Ian Botham |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> He played in 18 List A matches too, scoring 222 runs with a highest of 45[[not out|*]] (his Gold Award innings against Hampshire), took 12 wickets with a best of two for 16 and held four catches.<ref name=CAbatLA/><ref name=CAballLA/>\n\nBotham continued to make progress in 1975. Somerset struggled in the County Championship, winning only four of their twenty matches and finished joint 12th. In the JPL, they slumped badly from second to 14th. They reached the quarter-final of the B&H Cup but only the second round of the Gillette Cup. Botham played in 22 first-class and 23 List A matches so it was a busy season for him. In first-class, he scored 584 runs with a highest of 65, one of two half-centuries, and held 18 catches. He took 62 wickets, doubling his 1974 tally, with a best of five for 69, his only 5wI that season.<ref name=CAbatFC/><ref name=CAballFC/> In List A, he scored 232 runs with a highest of 38* and held seven catches. He took 32 wickets with a best of three for 34.<ref name=CAbatLA/><ref name=CAballLA/>\n\n===Somerset and England (1976)===\n1976 was a significant season for Botham as he scored over 1,000 runs for the first time, completed his first [[century (cricket)|century]] and earned international selection by [[England cricket team|England]] in two [[Limited Overs International]]s. Somerset improved in the County Championship to finish seventh, winning seven matches. They were one of five teams tied for first place in the JPL but their run rate was less than that of [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]], who were declared the champions. Somerset lost their opening match in the Gillette Cup and were eliminated at the group stage of the B&H Cup. Botham, though, came on in leaps and bounds. He totalled 1,022 first-class runs in 20 matches with a highest of 167*, his first-ever century and he also scored six half-centuries.<ref name=CAbatFC/> With the ball, he took 66 wickets with a best of six for 16. He had four 5wI and, for the first time, ten wickets in a match (10wM).<ref name=CAballFC/> He played in a total of 22 List A matches, including the two for England, scoring 395 runs with a highest of 46.<ref name=CAbatLA/> He took 33 wickets with a best of four for 41.<ref name=CAballLA/>\n\nIn the County Championship match against Sussex at Hove in May, Botham came very close to his maiden century but was dismissed for 97, his highest score to date. The match was drawn.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/36/36053.html |title=Sussex v Somerset (CC), 1976 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> At the end of the month, Somerset played [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] in a remarkable match at Taunton. Batting first, Somerset scored 333 for seven (innings closed) and then, thanks to six for 25 by Botham, bowled out Gloucestershire for only 79. The follow-on was enforced but Gloucestershire proved a much tougher nut to crack second time around. With [[Zaheer Abbas]] scoring 141, they made 372 and left Somerset needing 118 to win. Botham took five for 125 in the second innings for a match analysis of 11 for 150, his maiden 10wM. This match ended the same way as the famous Test at Headingley in 1981 but the boot was on the other foot for Botham here because he was on the team that enforced the follow-on \u2013 and lost. [[Mike Procter]] and [[Tony Brown (English cricketer)|Tony Brown]] did the damage and bowled Somerset out for 110 in 42 overs, Gloucestershire winning by just eight runs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/36/36135.html |title=Somerset v Gloucestershire (CC), 1976 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> \n\nBotham scored his maiden first-class century at [[Trent Bridge]] on Tuesday 3 August 1976 in the County Championship game against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] (Notts) who won the toss and decided to bat first. [[Derek Randall]] scored 204* and the Notts innings closed at 364 for 4 (Botham one for 59). Somerset were 52 for one at close of play. On day two, Somerset scored 304 for 8 (innings closed) and Botham, batting at number six, scored 80. At close of play, Notts in their second innings were 107 for four, thus extending their lead to 167 with six wickets standing. On day three, Notts advanced to 240 for nine declared (Botham one for 16), leaving Somerset with a difficult target of 301. At 40 for two and with both their openers gone, Brian Close changed his batting order and summoned Botham to come in at number four. Close himself had gone in at three but he was out soon afterwards for 35. With support from Graham Burgess (78), Botham laid into the Notts bowling and scored an impressive 167 not out. Somerset reached 302 for four in only 65 overs and won by six wickets.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/36/36135.html |title=Nottinghamshire v Somerset (CC), 1976 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nBotham's international d\u00e9but for [[England cricket team|England]] was on 26 August 1976 in a [[Limited Overs International]] (LOI) against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] at the [[North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough]]. The series was called the Prudential Trophy and the teams had 55 overs each per innings. Botham, still only 20, was the youngest player. At Scarborough, England captain [[Alan Knott]] lost the toss and Clive Lloyd, captaining the West Indies, elected to field first. Botham was number seven in the batting order and came in at 136 for five to join [[Graham Barlow]]. He scored only one before he was caught by [[Roy Fredericks]] off the bowling of his future ''[[Sky Sports]]'' colleague [[Michael Holding]]. England's innings closed at 202 for eight with Barlow 80 not out. West Indies lost Fredericks almost immediately but that brought Viv Richards to the crease and he hit 119 not out, winning the man of the match award, and leading West Indies to victory in only 41 overs by six wickets. Botham had the consolation of taking his first international wicket when he had [[Lawrence Rowe]] caught by [[Mike Hendrick]] for 10. He bowled only three overs and took some punishment from Richards, his return being one for 26.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/36/36537.html |title=England v West Indies (1st LOI), 1976 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> \n\nIn the second match at [[Lord's]], Botham was replaced by returning England captain Tony Greig. England lost by 36 runs as Richards, this time with 97, was again the difference between the teams. Having lost the series, England recalled Botham for the final match at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] on 30\u201331 August. The match was extended to two days and overs reduced to 32 per side. Tony Greig won the toss and decided to field. England began well and dismissed Fredericks and Richards, for a duck, in only the second over. West Indies were then seven for one but a powerful innings by Clive Lloyd pulled them out of trouble and they reached 223 for nine, innings closed. Botham bowled three very expensive overs, conceding 31 runs, but he did manage to bowl out Michael Holding for his second international wicket. England were never in the hunt and were bowled out for 173, West Indies winning by 50 runs and claiming the series 3\u20130. Botham again batted at number seven and made a good start, scoring 20 at a run a ball, but he was then caught by [[Bernard Julien]] off Fredericks and England were 151 for seven with only Knott and the tailenders left.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/36/36556.html |title=England v West Indies (1st LOI), 1976 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Grade cricket in Australia (1976\u201377)===\nIn the winter of 1976\u201377, after he had made his first two international appearances, Botham played [[Grade cricket]] in Australia for the [[University of Melbourne Cricket Club]]. He was joined by Yorkshire's [[Graham Stevenson]]. They were signed for the second half of the season on a sponsorship arranged through the [[Test and County Cricket Board]] (TCCB) by [[Whitbread|Whitbread's Brewery]]. Five of the competition's 15 rounds were abandoned because of adverse weather.<ref>Doust (1981), p. 50.</ref> It was apparently on this trip that Botham originally fell out with the former [[Australia national cricket team|Australian]] captain [[Ian Chappell]]. The cause seems to have been a cricket-related argument in a bar, which may have resulted in Chappell being pushed off his stool (the story is widely sourced but accounts differ). This became a long-running feud and, as late as the [[2010\u201311 Ashes series]], there was an altercation between Botham and Chappell in a car park at the [[Adelaide Oval]].<ref>{{cite news |date=7 December 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/theashes/8185931/The-Ashes-2010-Sir-Ian-Botham-and-Ian-Chappell-clash-in-Adelaide-car-park.html |title= The Ashes 2010: Sir Ian Botham and Ian Chappell clash in Adelaide car park |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |accessdate=7 December 2010 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wisdencricketer/content/current/story/321663.html |title=Botham v Chappell: time for a drink |publisher=Cricinfo |last=Mitchell |first=Kevin |date=December 2007 |accessdate=28 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Somerset and England (1977)===\nBotham produced a number of good batting and bowling performances for Somerset in 1977 and these impressed the [[Test cricket|Test]] selectors who included him in the team for the third Test against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] at [[Trent Bridge]], starting on 28 July. Having captured 36 first-class wickets through May and June, Botham had something of a purple patch in July which earned him his Test call-up. In the match against Sussex at Hove, which Somerset won by an innings and 37 runs, he took four for 111 and six for 50 for his second 10wM. In Somerset's innings of 448 for eight, he shared a 4th wicket partnership of 174 with Viv Richards. Botham scored 62, Richards 204.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/37/37236.html |title=Sussex v Somerset (CC), 1977 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> He took 22 more wickets, including two 5wI, in the next three County Championship games before his Test debut.

They reached the semi-final of the Gillette Cup but, without the injured Botham, were well beaten by eventual winners Middlesex. They were a poor tenth in the JPL and were eliminated from the B&H Cup at the group stage.\n\nBotham made his Test d\u00e9but at [[Trent Bridge]] on 28 July 1977 in the third Test against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]]. His d\u00e9but was somewhat overshadowed by the return from self-imposed Test exile of [[Geoffrey Boycott]]. England went into the match with a 1\u20130 series lead having won the second Test after the first had been drawn. The series was played against the background of the so-called \"[[Kerry Packer|Packer Affair]]\" which resulted in the establishment of [[World Series Cricket]] in the next Australian season. Because of Tony Greig's involvement, he had been stripped of the England captaincy but remained in the team under new captain [[Mike Brearley]]. England had three all-rounders at Trent Bridge with Greig, [[Geoff Miller]] and Botham all playing. Australian captain [[Greg Chappell]] won the toss and decided to bat first. Australia scored 243 and were all out shortly before the close on day one. Botham, aged 21, made an immediate impact and took five for 74, the highlight being the wicket of Chappell, bowled for just 19. England batted all through day two and into day three as Boycott, in his first Test innings since 1974, and Knott both made centuries. Botham came in at number eight on day three and scored 25 before he was bowled by [[Max Walker]]. England were all out not long afterwards for 364, a first innings lead of 121. Botham had no joy in Australia's second innings with none for 60. A century by [[Rick McCosker]] enabled Australia to score 309 before they were all out in the evening session on day four. [[Bob Willis]] took five for 88. England needed 189 to win and completed the job, by seven wickets, well into the final day with Brearley scoring 81 and Boycott, who batted on all five days, 80 not out. Botham didn't get a second innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/37/37378.html |title=England v Australia, 3rd Test, 1977 |accessdate=6 May 2017|work=espncricinfo}}</ref>\n\nBotham's impressive bowling at Trent Bridge meant he was an automatic choice for the fourth Test at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] two weeks later. England won the toss, decided to bat first and went on to win by an innings and 85 runs to secure a winning 3\u20130 lead in the series and regain [[The Ashes]], which they had lost in 1974\u201375. The match is famous for Boycott's one hundredth career century, scored on his home county ground and in his second Test since his return to the England fold. Botham was bowled third ball by [[Ray Bright]] without scoring. He made amends with the ball by taking five for 21 in only eleven overs, Australia being bowled out for only 103. The [[follow-on]] was enforced and Australia this time made 248, but Botham (none for 47) did not take a wicket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/37/37445.html |title=England v Australia, 4th Test, 1977 |accessdate=7 May 2017|work=espncricinfo}}</ref> He was injured during the second innings when he accidentally trod on the ball and broke a bone in his foot.

''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' commented that his 1977 season \"was marred only by a week's cricket idleness carrying the drinks at the Prudential matches, and a foot injury which ruined for him the end of the season and probably robbed him of a rare double. He finished with 88 wickets and 738 runs\".<ref name=WCY78/> Importantly, the foot injury was a broken toe sustained when he trod on the ball at Headingley and Botham subsequently needed treatment for it at his local hospital in Taunton. It was while going to one of his appointments that he took a wrong turn and ended up on a children's ward where he learned that some of the children were dying of [[leukaemia]].

It became a memorable season for Somerset as they built on their form in 1978 to win both the Gillette Cup and the JPL, their first-ever senior trophies.

England won the first at Edgbaston by an innings and 83 runs after opening with a massive total of 633 for five declared.

Thanks to a brilliant 221 by [[Sunil Gavaskar]], India came agonisingly close to pulling off a remarkable last day victory but ran out of time on 429 for eight (Botham three for 97), just nine runs short, and so England won the series 1\u20130 with three draws.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/39/39662.html |title=England v India, First Test, 1979 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe shambolic state of international cricket at the end of the 1970s was illustrated by the panic resulting from a hastily convened settlement between World Series Cricket and [[Cricket Australia|the Australian Board of Control]]. Although they had visited Australia only twelve months earlier to play for the Ashes, England were persuaded to go there again and play another three Tests, but with the Ashes not at stake.  As ''Wisden'' put it, the programme did not have the best interests of cricket at heart, particularly Australian cricket below Test level, which had been \"swamped by the accent on Test and one-day internationals, neatly parcelled to present a cricketing package suitable for maximum exploitation on television\".<ref name=W79>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/69697.html |title=England in Australia and India, 1979\u201380 |publisher=WisdenOnline |accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref> The matches were widely perceived to be semi-official only and received \"a definite thumbs down\".<ref name=W79/> Botham was a member of the England team and played in all three matches which, rightly or wrongly, count towards his Test statistics.

In the first match, played at the [[WACA Ground]], Botham had match figures of eleven for 176 but to no avail as Australia won by 138 runs. Having excelled with the ball in that match, Botham did so with his bat in the third one, scoring an unbeaten 119 in the second innings of the third.<ref name=ITBTests/> Australia won all three matches of a series best forgotten for all its attendant politics, but Botham had enhanced his reputation as a world-class all-rounder.<ref name=W79/>\n\n===Jubilee Test, India, February 1980===\nBotham's third overseas tour was to [[English cricket team in India in 1979\u201380|India in February 1980]].<ref name=ITBTests>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1529/Test_Matches.html |title=Test matches played by Ian Botham |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=1 May 2017}}</ref> It was the fiftieth anniversary of India's entry into Test cricket and so England played a single commemorative Test at the [[Wankhede Stadium]] in [[Mumbai|Bombay]].

England replied with 296, the highlight being Botham's 114 from just 144 balls; he began his innings with England in trouble at 57 for four. This quickly became 58 for five and Botham was joined by England's other match hero Taylor. England's first five batsmen had contributed just 51 to the total. Botham was often unfairly labelled a \"big hitter\" but in fact his style was very orthodox (i.e., he \"played straight\") and in this innings he scored 17 fours but, significantly, no sixes. Taylor provided dogged support and their sixth wicket partnership realised 171 runs. When Botham was out near the end of day two, the score was 229 for six and England reached 232 for six at close of play, still ten runs behind. On the third morning, Taylor led England past India's total and, with useful batting performances by the specialist bowlers, England totalled 296 to gain a first innings lead of 54.<ref name=IvE80/>\n\nIndia's second innings was a disaster and they lost eight wickets by the close of play on the third day with only [[Kapil Dev]] offering any resistance. They were all out early on the fourth day for 149. Botham was the outstanding performer again, taking seven for 48 which gave him match figures of thirteen for 106. [[Geoffrey Boycott]] and [[Graham Gooch]] scored the necessary runs for England to win by ten wickets with a day to spare.<ref name=IvE80/>\n\n===Somerset and England (1980 to 1980\u201381)===\nMike Brearley announced his retirement from Test cricket after the Jubilee Test in Bombay and, somewhat surprisingly given his lack of captaincy experience, Botham was appointed to replace him as England's [[captain (cricket)|captain]] for the forthcoming home series against [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], who were at the time the world's outstanding team. Botham led England in twelve Tests in 1980 and 1981 but he was unsuccessful, the team achieving no wins, eight draws and four defeats under his leadership. In addition, his form suffered and was eventually dismissed from the post, although he did actually resign just before the selectors were about to fire him. In Botham's defence, nine of his matches as captain were against West Indies, who afterwards won twelve of their next thirteen Tests against England. The other three were all against Australia.\n\nIn 1980, which was a wet summer, West Indies had the better of all five Test matches, although, with the rain constantly intervening, they were able to win only one of them. Botham had a poor season as a bowler and, in all first-class cricket, took just 40 wickets at the high average of 34.67 with a best return of only four for 38. He did better as a batsman, scoring 1,149 runs (the second time, after 1976, that he topped a thousand in a season) at 42.55. He completed two centuries and six other half-centuries. His highest score in the season was ultimately the highest of his career: 228 for Somerset against Gloucestershire at Taunton in May. He batted for just over three hours, hitting 27 fours and ten sixes. With Gloucestershire batting out time for a draw on the final day, Somerset used all eleven players as bowlers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/40/40145.html |title=Somerset v Gloucestershire (CC), 1980 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=9 May 2010}}</ref> Apart from an innings of 57 in the first Test, Botham contributed little to England in the series and that innings was the only time he reached 50 in all his twelve Tests as England captain.\n\nSomerset came close to retaining their JPL title in 1980 but had to be content with second place, only two points behind [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]]. They finished a credible fifth in the County Championship but were eliminated from both the Gillette and B&H Cups in the opening phase.\n\nBotham led England on the controversial tour of the West Indies from January to April 1981. The second Test, scheduled to be played at [[Bourda]], was cancelled after the [[Guyana|Guyanese government]] revoking the visa of [[Robin Jackman]] because of his playing and coaching links with [[South Africa]]. The other four Tests were played and West Indies won the series 2\u20130 but England were helped by rain in the two drawn matches. Botham took the most wickets for England, but ''Wisden'' said \"his bowling never recovered the full rhythm of a year before\". His batting, however, apart from one good LOI performance, \"was found wanting in technique, concentration and eventually in confidence\". In ''Wisden's'' view, Botham's loss of form \"could be cited as eloquent evidence of the undesirability of saddling a fast bowler and vital all-rounder with the extra burden of captaincy\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152217.html |title=England in West Indies, 1980\u201381 |publisher=WisdenOnline |accessdate=9 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Somerset and England (1981)===\nThe England captaincy had affected Botham's form as a player and in his last Test as captain, against Australia at [[Lord's]] in 1981, he was dismissed for a [[List of cricket terms#P|pair]].<ref name=EA81II>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/41/41354.html |title=England v Australia, Second Test 1981 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> According to ''Wisden'' editor [[Matthew Engel]], writing in ''[[ESPNcricinfo]]'', Botham \"resigned (a minute before being sacked), his form shot to pieces\" after that match.<ref name=ME/> Australia were then leading the series 1\u20130 after two Tests with four more to be played. Botham was replaced by the returning [[Mike Brearley]], who had been his predecessor until retiring from Test cricket in 1980.\n\nBotham continued to play for England under Brearley and achieved the highpoint of his career in the next three Tests as England recovered to win [[The Ashes]]. In the third Test at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]], Australia opened with 401 for 9 declared, despite good bowling by Botham who took 6 for 95. England responded poorly and were dismissed for 174. Botham was the only batsman to perform at all well and scored 50, which was his first Test half-century since he had been awarded the captaincy thirteen Tests earlier.

Botham had a poor series and tour. He played in nine first-class matches and scored only 434 runs at the low average of 24.11 with a highest of 65.

In the County Championship, they finished seventh in 1984 and then dropped to 17th (bottom of the table) in 1985. In the JPL, they were 15th in 1984 and eleventh in 1985. They made little impression in either of the B&H Cup or the NatWest Trophy so, all in all, Botham's captaincy period was a lean time for the club who had enjoyed its most successful period ever in the preceding seasons.\n\nBotham played in 18 Tests from 1984 to 1986, ten of them (five home, five away) against West Indies. Throughout Botham's Test career, the highest international standards were set by West Indies and Botham was generally unsuccessful against them. In both of these series, 1984 and 1985\u201386, West Indies beat England 5\u20130 in whitewashes that were dubbed \"blackwash\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/engvwi/content/story/292033.html | title=England v West Indies: 1980\u20131995|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=|accessdate=4 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nIronically, his highest score and both his best and worst bowling performances against West Indies occurred in the same match at Lord's in 1984.

This was Botham's best-ever bowling performance against West Indies by some distance. England began their second innings and had been reduced to 88 for four when Botham joined [[Allan Lamb]]. They reached 114 for four at day three close. There was no Sunday play and England resumed on the Monday 155 runs ahead with six wickets standing. Botham and Lamb added 128 for the fifth wicket before Botham was out for 81, including nine fours and one six, easily his highest score and best innings against West Indies. Lamb made a century and England were all out on the Tuesday morning (final day) for exactly 300. West Indies needed 342 to win in five and a half hours. They lost [[Desmond Haynes]] to a run out at 57 for 0, whereupon [[Larry Gomes]] (92 not out) joined [[Gordon Greenidge]] (214 not out) and West Indies went on to win by nine wickets with 11.5 of the last twenty overs to spare.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/44/44895.html |title=England v West Indies, Lord's, 1984 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref> Although ''Wisden'' does not name Botham except as an \"inattentive\" fielder who dropped a catch, it describes the England bowlers \"looking second-rate and nobody but Willis bowling the right line or setting the right field to the powerful and phlegmatic Greenidge\".

He scored 250 runs at 31.25 with a highest of 85.

affinity with [[Brian Close]], his first county captain who became a mentor to him, as they shared a determination to do well and win matches. ''Wisden'' has commented on another shared characteristic: \"outstanding courage\", mainly because Botham would readily field anywhere, generally in the slips but also in dangerous positions near the batsman and he was a brilliant fielder.<ref name=WCY78>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154495.html |title=Ian Botham: Cricketer of the Year |publisher=John Wisden & Co. |date=1978 |accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref> As a batsman, Botham was often wrongly labelled by the tabloid press as a \"big hitter\" (effectively inferring that he was a \"[[Pinch hitter (cricket)|slogger]]\") but, while it is true that his strength enabled him to drive a ball for six and his courage to hook one for six, Botham actually had a very correct batting style as he stood side-on and played straight: ''Wisden'' praised his \"straight hitting and square cutting\".<ref name=WCY78/> Botham might not have been good enough to retain a regular England place as a specialist batsman (his Test career [[batting average]] was a fairly modest 33.54) but as a bowler who was capable of taking 383 Test wickets, he certainly would. ''Wisden'' praised [[Tom Cartwright]] for helping to develop Botham's technique as a [[swing bowling|swing bowler]] and, by the time he made his Test debut in 1977, Botham had mastered change of pace, the [[outswinger]] and the fast [[inswinger|inswinging]] [[yorker]], all formidable parts of his repertoire which eventually enabled him to break the world Test wicket record.<ref name=WCY78/>\n\nWriting in ''Barclays World of Cricket'' (1986), former England captain [[Tony Lewis]] commented upon Botham's strength, enthusiasm and aggression \"which he took into every game\".<ref name=BSW157>Barclay's, pp. 157\u2013158.</ref> Lewis, however, pointed out that Botham's exuberance often reduced the efficiency of his play, in that he would take too many risks or refuse to give up on a bowling tactic despite ongoing heavy cost. He summarised Botham as an exciting cricketer who lacked self-discipline.<ref name=BSW157/> Botham was in the middle of his career when the book was published but Lewis emphasised the speed at which Botham had achieved certain milestones such as 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in Test cricket. At that time, there seemed no reason why Botham should not go on reaching milestones but he had already peaked and, in retrospect, his career had a meteoric aspect. His rival [[Imran Khan]] asserted this when he said: \"Botham was someone who I don't think ever did justice to his talent. When he started he could have done anything, but he declined very quickly. In a way our careers were the opposite of each other. I started quite slowly but got better, maximised my talent. He went the other way, I think\".<ref name=OG2006/>\n\n==Status as a player==\nBecause of Botham's natural exuberance, allied to the more outstanding all-round performances of his early Test career and his tendency to court controversy, he became a so-called \"celebrity\" in the eyes of the tabloid press and, as [[Derek Birley]] put it: \"for the young he was the great hero (at Headingley in 1981)\".<ref name=DB324>Birley, p. 324.</ref> As a result, media hacks ignorantly proclaimed him to be the greatest cricketer England ever had, the world's greatest-ever all-rounder, etc. and this syndrome is still evident in 2017 when a contributor to ''[[ESPNcricinfo]]'' writes about Botham \"revelling in his status as cricket's first [[superstar]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2017/content/story/1084595.html |title=It is a challenge but I will rise to it |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |date=2017 |accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref> So-called \"superstardom\" is a concept that in fact dates right back to the 18th century in cricket because, in [[The Cricketers of My Time|his classic book]], [[John Nyren]] described [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]]'s master batsman [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] as \"a star of the first magnitude\" (i.e., a \"superstar\").<ref>Nyren, p. 57.</ref> A century after Small came [[W. G. Grace]], something of a \"superstar\" himself, whom [[C. L. R. James]] in [[Beyond A Boundary|another classic book]] placed among the three most eminent Victorians.<ref>James, p. 212.</ref> In the 20th century, the likes of [[Jack Hobbs]], [[Wilfred Rhodes]], [[Wally Hammond]], [[Denis Compton]], [[Fred Trueman]] and [[Gary Sobers]] were all \"superstars\" in their day; as was an Australian called [[Don Bradman]].\n\nThe tabloid/juvenile hagiography of Botham has caused many knowledgeable commentators to assert that Botham was overrated, a problem for him that dates right back to his first Test series in 1977. When naming him as a [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Cricketer of the Year]] in its 1978 edition, ''Wisden'' described Botham as \"a determined character who knows where he is aiming, and who will, quite naturally and fiercely, address himself to the interesting view that he is overrated\".<ref name=WCY78/> [[Denis Compton]], another great English cricketer who was idolised by the media, dismissed Botham as \"overrated\" and said he \"only did well because all the best players had joined [[Kerry Packer|Packer]]\": i.e., for [[World Series Cricket]] (WSC).<ref name=DB324/> The point made by Compton about WSC concerns its impact on the Australian team. In 1981 and 1985, their squads to England in the aftermath of WSC were two of their weakest ever, as the Test series results confirm because, apart from [[Allan Border]], they lacked top-class batsmen. Birley countered Compton's point by writing that \"a player can hardly be blamed for the quality of the opposition he faces\".<ref name=DB324/> As described above, Botham excelled in 1981 after he shed the millstone of captaincy and he was England's main strike bowler in 1985 but, in 1989, after the post-Packer tide had turned and Australia could put a world-class team into the field again, Botham was made to look ordinary.\n\nGiven all the arguments about whether Botham was the greatest or whether he was overrated, it must be stressed that there is no evidence anywhere of Botham himself claiming, [[Muhammad Ali]]-style (or even [[Fred Trueman]]-style), that he ever was \"the greatest\" or of him \"revelling in superstar status\". Rather, he would readily give praise to his colleagues and effectively assert that cricket is a team game in which he always did his best and played to win (just like Brian Close, his mentor): for example, the credit which Botham gave to his batting partners [[Hallam Moseley]] and [[Bob Clapp]] after the 1974 Benson and Hedges quarter-final against Hampshire;<ref name=WCY78/> and to [[Bob Willis]] who, after all, was the actual match-winner at Headingley in 1981.<ref name=W327>{{cite book |last=Wisden |title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 119th edition |edition=1982 |editor-last=Woodcock |editor-first=John |editor-link=John Woodcock (cricket writer) |publisher=MacDonald Queen Anne Press |location=London |page=327}}</ref> Botham's innings there was an outstanding performance but, in match terms, it gave England a ray of hope which, without Willis's brilliant bowling on the final day, would have been extinguished for, as ''Wisden'' said: \"This was Willis' hour\".<ref name=W327/> Botham has turned all the publicity to good use in one important respect as it made him famous outside cricket and that has generated increased public interest, and investment, in his charity fundraising efforts.\n\nBotham cannot be dismissed as \"overrated\" or lauded as \"the greatest\", but he was unquestionably an outstanding player, especially in the first half of his career, as the table above demonstrates. As a Test batsman, he scored 14 centuries with a highest score of 208 against India in 1982. Thirteen of his centuries were scored before his thirtieth birthday in November 1985.<ref name=CAbat>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1529/t_Batting_by_Season.html |title=Test Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Ian Botham |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref> It is a similar picture in terms of his Test bowling.

His first, in 1985, was a 900-mile trek from [[Land's End to John o' Groats|John o' Groats to Land's End]]. His efforts were inspired after a visit to [[Taunton]]'s [[Musgrove Park Hospital]] in 1977 whilst receiving treatment for a broken toe.

Geoff Boycott was also in attendance, along with Fred Trueman's widow Veronica and [[Colin Graves]] who, as [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]] chairman, accepted the honour on behalf of Wilfred Rhodes.

''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' is often considered as the first true FPS, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' was a game that popularized the genre and PC gaming in general, and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' was id's first true 3D FPS.\n\nOn June 24, 2009, [[ZeniMax Media]] acquired the company.

In September 1990, [[John Carmack]] developed [[adaptive tile refresh|an efficient way to rapidly side-scroll graphics]] on the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]. Upon making this breakthrough, Carmack and [[Tom Hall]] stayed up late into the night making a replica of the first level of the popular 1988 [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', inserting stock graphics of [[John Romero]]'s Dangerous Dave character in lieu of Mario. When Romero saw the [[game demo|demo]], entitled \"Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement\", he realized that Carmack's breakthrough could have potential. The team that would later form id Software immediately began moonlighting, going so far as to \"borrow\" company computers that were not being used over the weekends and at nights while they designed their own remake of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.\n\nDespite their work, Nintendo turned them down, saying they had no interest in expanding to the PC market, and that Mario games were to remain exclusive to Nintendo consoles. Around this time, [[Scott Miller (programmer)|Scott Miller]] of [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]] learned of the group and their exceptional talent, having played one of Romero's Softdisk games, ''Dangerous Dave'', and contacted Romero under the guise of multiple fan letters that Romero came to realize all originated from the same address.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with John Romero |url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2006/05/the_apogee_legacy_19.html |date=May 15, 2006 |accessdate=July 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110121949/http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2006/05/the_apogee_legacy_19.html |archivedate=November 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=20 Years of Evolution: Scott Miller and 3D Realms |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4112/20_years_of_evolution_scott_.php |date=August 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808123226/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4112/20_years_of_evolution_scott_.php |archivedate=August 8, 2013}}</ref> When he confronted Miller, Miller explained that the deception was necessary since Softdisk screened letters it received. Although disappointed by not actually having received mail from multiple fans, Romero and other Softdisk developers began proposing ideas to Miller, including ''[[Commander Keen]]'' in December 1990, which became a very successful [[shareware]] game.

Brainstormed by [[John Romero]], id Software held a weekend session titled \"The id Summer Seminar\" in the summer of 1991 with prospective buyers including [[Scott Miller (programmer)|Scott Miller]], [[George Broussard]], Ken Rogoway, Jim Norwood and [[Todd Replogle]]. One of the nights, id Software put together an impromptu game known as \"Wac-Man\" to demonstrate not only the technical prowess of the ''Keen'' engine, but also how it worked internally.\n\nid Software has developed their own game engine for each of their titles when moving to the next technological milestone, including ''Commander Keen'', ''Wolfenstein 3D'', ''[[ShadowCaster]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Kushner |first=David |authorlink=David Kushner |title=[[Masters of Doom]] |edition=paperback |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year=2004 |pages=119\u2013122 |isbn=0-8129-7215-5}}</ref> ''Doom'', ''Quake'', ''Quake II'', and ''Quake III'', as well as the technology used in making ''Doom 3''. After being used first for id Software's in-house game, the engines are licensed out to other developers. According to ''Eurogamer.net'', \"id Software has been synonymous with PC game engines since the concept of a detached game engine was first popularized\". During the mid to late 1990s, \"the launch of each successive round of technology it's been expected to occupy a headlining position\", with the ''Quake III'' engine being most widely adopted of their engines. However [[id Tech 4]] had far fewer licensees than the [[Unreal Engine]] from [[Epic Games]], due to the long development time that went into ''Doom 3'' which id Software had to release before licensing out that engine to others.\n\nIn conjunction with his self-professed affinity for sharing [[source code]], John Carmack has open-sourced most of the major id Software engines under the [[GNU General Public License]]. Historically, the [[source code]] for each engine has been released once the code base is 5 years old. Consequently, many home grown projects have sprung up porting the code to different platforms, cleaning up the source code, or providing major modifications to the core engine. ''Wolfenstein 3D'', ''DOOM'' and ''Quake'' engine ports are ubiquitous to nearly all platforms capable of running games, such as hand-held PCs, iPods, the PSP, the Nintendo DS and more. Impressive core modifications include DarkPlaces which adds stencil shadow volumes into the original ''Quake'' engine along with a more efficient network protocol. Another such project is [[ioquake3]], which maintains a goal of cleaning up the source code, adding features and fixing bugs. Even earlier id Software code, namely for ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'' and ''[[Catacomb 3D]]'', was released in June 2014 by [[Flat Rock Software]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTcxMjM |title=id Software's Softdisk Open-Sources Some Really Old Games |first=Michael |last=Larabel |date=June 6, 2014 |accessdate=June 6, 2014 |publisher=[[Phoronix]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609231037/http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTcxMjM |archivedate=June 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe GPL release of the ''Quake III'' engine's source code was moved from the end of 2004 to August 2005 as the engine was still being licensed to commercial customers who would otherwise be concerned over the sudden loss in value of their recent investment.\n\nOn August 4, 2011, [[John Carmack]] revealed during his [[QuakeCon]] 2011 keynote that they will be releasing the source code of the ''[[Doom 3]]'' engine ([[id Tech 4]]) during the year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doom 3 Source-Code To Be Released This Year |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTc1MQ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011045711/http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTc1MQ |archivedate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nid Software publicly stated they would not support the [[Wii]] console (possibly due to technical limitations),<ref>{{cite web |title=id Software boss unconvinced by Wii |url=http://play.tm/news/24147/id-software-boss-unconvinced-by-wii/ |date=April 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413101828/http://play.tm/news/24147/id-software-boss-unconvinced-by-wii/ |archivedate=April 13, 2009}}</ref> although they have since indicated that they may release titles on that platform (although it would be limited to their games released during the 1990s).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001953/http://www.cubed3.com/news/6961/1/id_Properties_Coming_to_Wii \"id Properties Coming to Wii\"] from Cubed3</ref>\n\nSince id Software revealed their engine [[id Tech 5]], they call their engines \"[[id Tech]]\", followed by a version number.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.idsoftware.com/business/technology |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215034944/http://www.idsoftware.com/business/technology |archivedate=December 15, 2007 |title=id Software: Technology licensing |publisher=idsoftware.com |accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref> Older engines have retroactively been renamed to fit this scheme, with the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]] as id Tech 1.\n\n=== Linux gaming ===\n[[File:Timothee-Besset.jpg|thumb|right|Timothee Besset has been responsible for many Linux ports of id Software's games]]\nid Software was an early pioneer in the [[Linux gaming]] market,<ref>[http://gaming.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=1011&page=3 HEXUS.gaming \u2013 Feature \u2013 Linux Gaming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719184812/http://gaming.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=1011&page=3 |date=July 19, 2011 }} Jo Shields, March 25, 2005</ref> and id Software's [[Linux]] games have been some of the most popular of the platform.

The game was very successful and spawned a whole series of titles. It was also the series of id Software that designer [[Tom Hall]] was most affiliated with. The first ''Commander Keen'' trilogy was released on December 14, 1990.\n\n=== ''Wolfenstein'' ===\n{{Main article|Wolfenstein (series)}}\nThe company's breakout product was released on May 5, 1992: ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', a [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) with smooth 3D graphics that were unprecedented in computer games, and with violent gameplay that many gamers found engaging. After essentially founding an entire genre with this game, id Software created ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', ''[[Quake II]]'', ''[[Quake III Arena]]'', ''[[Quake 4]]'', and ''[[Doom 3]]''. Each of these first-person shooters featured progressively higher levels of graphical technology. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' spawned a prequel and a sequel: the prequel called ''[[Spear of Destiny (computer game)|Spear of Destiny]]'', and the second, ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', using the [[id Tech 3]] [[game engine|engine]]. A third ''Wolfenstein'' sequel, simply titled ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'', was released by [[Raven Software]], using the [[id Tech 4]] [[game engine|engine]]. Another sequel, named ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]''; was developed using the [[id Tech 5]] engine and released by [[MachineGames]] in 2014, with it getting a prequel by the name of ''[[Wolfenstein: The Old Blood]]'' a year later; followed by a direct sequel titled ''[[Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus]]'' in 2017.\n\n=== ''Doom'' ===\n{{Main article|Doom (series)}}\nEighteen months after their release of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', on December 10, 1993, id Software released ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' which would again set new standards for graphic quality and graphic violence in computer gaming. ''Doom'' featured a [[science fiction|sci-fi]]/[[horror fiction|horror]] setting with graphic quality that had never been seen on personal computers or even [[video game console]]s. ''Doom'' became a cultural phenomenon and its violent theme would eventually launch a new wave of [[Video game controversy|criticism]] decrying the dangers of violence in video games. ''Doom'' was ported to numerous platforms, inspired many knock-offs, and was eventually followed by the technically similar ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]''. id Software made its mark in video game history with the [[shareware]] release of ''Doom'', and eventually revisited the theme of this game in 2004 with their release of ''[[Doom 3]]''. John Carmack said in an interview at QuakeCon 2007 that there will be a ''[[Doom 4]]''. It began development on May 7, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0803.1731.12214.htm?Page=2 |title=QuakeCon 2007: John Carmack Talks Rage, id Tech 5 And More |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=October 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029050912/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0803.1731.12214.htm?Page=2 |archivedate=October 29, 2007}}</ref> ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', the fourth installation and a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the Doom series, was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on May 13, 2016, and was later released on Nintendo Switch on November 10, 2017.\n\n=== ''Quake'' ===\n{{Main article|Quake (series)}}\nOn June 22, 1996, the release of ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' marked the second milestone in id Software history. ''Quake'' combined a cutting edge fully 3D engine, the [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]], with a distinctive art style to create critically acclaimed graphics for its time. Audio was not neglected either, having recruited [[Nine Inch Nails]] frontman [[Trent Reznor]] to facilitate unique sound effects and ambient music for the game. (A small homage was paid to Nine Inch Nails in the form of the band's logo appearing on the ammunition boxes for the nailgun weapon.) It also included the work of [[Michael Abrash]]. Furthermore, ''Quake'''s main innovation, the capability to play a deathmatch (competitive gameplay between living opponents instead of against computer-controlled characters) over the Internet (especially through the add-on ''[[QuakeWorld]]''), seared the title into the minds of gamers as another smash hit.\n\nIn 2008, id Software was honored at the 59th Annual [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s for the pioneering work ''Quake'' represented in user modifiable games.<ref>[http://kotaku.com/342028/2008-tech-emmy-winners 2008 Tech Emmy Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929094303/http://kotaku.com/342028/2008-tech-emmy-winners |date=September 29, 2012 }} from Kotaku.com</ref> id Software is the only game development company ever honored twice by the [[National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]], having been given an Emmy Award in 2007 for creation of the 3D technology that underlies modern [[Shooter game|shooter]] video games.<ref>[http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/010710_id_carmack_emmys.x \"John Carmack and id Software's pioneering development work in 3d games recognized with two Technology Emmy Awards\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705061409/http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/010710_id_carmack_emmys.x |date=July 5, 2008 }} from [[Shacknews]]</ref>\n\nThe [[Quake (series)|''Quake'' series]] continued with ''[[Quake II]]'' in 1997. Activision purchased a 49% stake in id Software, making it a second party which took publishing duties until 2009. However, the game is not a storyline sequel, and instead focuses on an assault on an alien planet, Stroggos, in retaliation for [[Strogg]] attacks on [[Earth]]. Most of the subsequent entries in the ''Quake'' franchise follow this storyline. ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' (1999), the next title in the series, has minimal plot, but centers around the \"Arena Eternal\", a gladiatorial setting created by an alien race known as the Vadrigar and populated by combatants plucked from various points in time and space. Among these combatants are some characters either drawn from or based on those in ''Doom'' (\"[[Doomguy]]\"), ''Quake'' (Ranger, Wrack), and ''Quake II'' (Bitterman, Tank Jr., Grunt, Stripe). ''[[Quake IV]]'' (2005) picks up where ''Quake II'' left off \u2013 finishing the war between the humans and Strogg. The spin-off ''[[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars]]'' acts as a prequel to ''Quake II'', when the Strogg first invade Earth. It should be noted that ''Quake IV'' and ''Enemy Territory: Quake Wars'' were made by outside developers and not id.\n\nThere have also been a few other spin off games such as [[Quake (video game)#Quake Mobile|Quake Mobile]] in 2005 and ''[[Quake Live]]'', an internet browser based modification of ''Quake III''. A game called ''Quake Arena DS'' was planned and canceled for the [[Nintendo DS]]. John Carmack stated, at [[QuakeCon]] 2007, that the ''[[id Tech 5]]'' engine would be used for a new ''Quake'' game.\n\n=== ''Rage'' ===\n{{Main article|Rage (video game)}}\nTodd Hollenshead announced in May 2007 that id Software had begun working on an all new series that would be using a new engine. Hollenshead also mentioned that the title would be completely developed in-house, marking the first game since 2004's ''[[Doom 3]]'' to be done so.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://tgnforums.stardock.com/?forumid=141&aid=154029 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025815/http://tgnforums.stardock.com/?forumid=141&aid=154029 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |title=New IP Coming From id Software |publisher=Totalgaming.net |date=May 31, 2007 |accessdate=June 1, 2007}}</ref> At 2007's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|WWDC]], John Carmack showed the new engine called [[id Tech 5]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2007/06/11/wwdc-game-on/ |title=WWDC: Game On |publisher=MacRumors |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=June 11, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170810/http://www.macrumors.com/2007/06/11/wwdc-game-on/ |archivedate=March 3, 2016}}</ref> Later that year, at [[QuakeCon]] 2007, the title of the new game was revealed as ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48289 |title=id Reveals Rage, Implies PS3, 360 and PC Versions |publisher=shacknews |date=August 3, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235543/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48289 |archivedate=September 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn July 14, 2008, id Software announced at the 2008 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] event that they would be publishing ''Rage'' through [[Electronic Arts]], and not id's longtime publisher [[Activision]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=193022 |title=id Software, EA Partner For RAGE Publishing Deal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730003532/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=193022 |archivedate=July 30, 2008}}</ref> However, since then ZeniMax has also announced that they are publishing ''Rage'' through [[Bethesda Softworks]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bethblog.com/index.php/2009/12/15/bethesda-softworks-to-publish-rage/ |title=ZeniMax/Bethesda to publish RAGE}}</ref>\n\nOn August 12, 2010, during Quakecon 2010, id Software announced ''Rage'' US ship date of September 13, 2011, and a European ship date of September 15, 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gamespot.com/events/quakecon2010/story.html?sid=6273462 |title=id shows more Rage and announces release date |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819145447/http://www.gamespot.com/events/quakecon2010/story.html?sid=6273462 |archivedate=August 19, 2010}}</ref> During the keynote, id Software also demonstrated a ''Rage'' spin-off title running on the [[iPhone]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/08/12/quakecon-rage-coming-to-iphone-running-at-60fps/ |title=QuakeCon: Rage coming to iPhone, running at 60fps |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218110711/http://www.joystiq.com/2010/08/12/quakecon-rage-coming-to-iphone-running-at-60fps/ |archivedate=December 18, 2010}} from Joystiq.com</ref> This technology demo later became ''Rage HD''.\n\nOn May 14, 2018, Bethesda Softworks announced ''[[Rage 2]]'', a co-development between id Software and [[Avalanche Studios]].\n\n=== Other games ===\n[[File:Keen3Gameplay.png|thumb|right|180px|Screenshot of a ''Commander Keen'' game, ''Keen Must Die!'']]\n[[File:Doom ingame 1.png|thumb|180px|A screenshot from the first episode of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'']]\nDuring its early days, id Software produced much more varied games; these include the early 3D first-person shooter experiments that led to ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' and ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' \u2013 ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'' and ''[[Catacomb 3D]]''. There was also the ''[[Rescue Rover]]'' series, which had two games \u2013 ''Rescue Rover'' and ''Rescue Rover 2''. Also there was [[John Romero]]'s ''[[Dangerous Dave]]'' series, which included such notables as the tech demo (''In Copyright Infringement'') which led to the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' engine, and the decently popular ''[[Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion]]''. ''In the Haunted Mansion'' was powered by the same engine as the earlier id Software game ''[[Shadow Knights]]'', which was one of the several games written by id Software to fulfill their contractual obligation to produce games for [[Softdisk]], where the id Software founders had been employed. id Software has also overseen several games using its technology that were not made in one of their IPs such as ''[[ShadowCaster]]'', (early-[[Doom engine|id Tech 1]]), ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'', ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'' (id Tech 1), ''[[Hexen II]]'' ([[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]]), and ''[[Orcs and Elves]]'' (''[[Doom RPG]]'' engine).\n\n== Other media ==\nid Software has also been associated with novels since the publication of the original [[Doom novels|''Doom'' novels]]. This has been restarted from 2008 onward with [[Matthew J.

While many of the killers\u2014like the vast majority of young teenage boys\u2014did play video games, this study did not find a relationship between game play and school shootings.

Despite the fact that Nazis are portrayed as the enemy in ''Wolfenstein'', the use of those symbols is a federal offense in Germany unless certain circumstances apply. Similarly, the [[Atari Jaguar]] version was confiscated following a verdict by the Amtsgericht Berlin Tiergarten on December 7, 1994.\n\nDue to concerns from Nintendo of America, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] version was modified to not include any swastikas or Nazi references; furthermore, blood was replaced with sweat to make the game seem less violent, and the attack dogs in the game were replaced by giant mutant rats. Employees of id Software are quoted in ''The Official DOOM Player Guide'' about the reaction to ''Wolfenstein'', claiming it to be ironic that it was morally acceptable to shoot people and rats, but not dogs. Two new weapons were added as well. The Super NES version was not as successful as the PC version.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n== People ==\nIn 2003, the book ''[[Masters of Doom]]'' chronicled the development of id Software, concentrating on the personalities and interaction of John Carmack and John Romero. Below are the key people involved with id's success.\n\n=== John Carmack ===\n{{Main article|John Carmack}}\nCarmack's skill at [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[computer programming|programming]] is widely recognized in the software industry and from its inception, he was id's [[lead programmer]]. On August 7, 2013, he joined [[Oculus VR]], a company developing [[virtual reality headset]]s, and left id Software on November 22, 2013.<ref name=carmack-leaves-id />\n\n=== John Romero ===\n{{Main article|John Romero}}\nJohn Romero, who was forced to resign after the release of ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', later formed the ill-fated company [[Ion Storm]]. There, he became infamous through the development of ''[[Daikatana]]'', which was received negatively from reviewers and gamers alike upon release.\n\nBoth Tom Hall and John Romero have reputations as designers and idea men who have helped shape some of the key PC gaming titles of the 1990s.\n\n=== Tom Hall ===\n{{Main article|Tom Hall}}\nTom Hall was forced to resign by id Software during the early days of ''Doom'' development, but not before he had some impact; for example, he was responsible for the inclusion of teleporters in the game. He was let go before the shareware release of ''Doom'' and then went to work for Apogee, developing ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'' with the \"Developers of Incredible Power\". When he finished work on that game, he found he was not compatible with the ''[[Prey (2006 video game)|Prey]]'' development team at Apogee, and therefore left to join his ex-id Software compatriot John Romero at [[Ion Storm]]. Hall has frequently commented that if he could obtain the rights to ''[[Commander Keen]]'', he would immediately develop another Keen title.\n\n=== Sandy Petersen ===\n{{Main article|Sandy Petersen}}\nSandy Petersen was a level designer for 19 of the 27 levels in the original ''Doom'' title as well as 17 of the 32 levels of ''Doom II''. As a fan of [[H.P. Lovecraft]], his influence is apparent in the Lovecraftian feel of the monsters for ''Quake'', and he created ''Inferno'', the third \"episode\" of the first DOOM. He was forced to resign from id Software during the production of ''Quake II'' and most of his work was scrapped before the title was released.\n\n=== American McGee ===\n{{Main article|American McGee}}\nAmerican McGee was a [[level designer]] for ''Doom II'', ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Quake'', and ''Quake II''. He was asked to resign after the release of ''Quake II'', then moved to [[Electronic Arts]] where he gained industry notoriety with the development of his own game ''[[American McGee's Alice]]''. After leaving Electronic Arts, he became an independent entrepreneur and game developer. McGee now heads [[independent game development]] house [[Spicy Horse]] in Shanghai, where he works on various projects.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* Kushner, David (2003).

Integration is one of the two main operations of [[calculus]], with its inverse operation, [[derivative|differentiation]], being the other. Given a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{mvar|f}} of a [[Real number|real]] [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] {{mvar|x}} and an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} of the [[real line]], the '''definite integral'''\n\n: <math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx</math>\n\nis defined informally as the signed [[area (geometry)|area]] of the region in the {{mvar|xy}}-plane that is bounded by the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of {{mvar|f}}, the {{mvar|x}}-axis and the vertical lines {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''b''}}. The area above the {{mvar|x}}-axis adds to the total and that below the {{mvar|x}}-axis subtracts from the total.\n\nThe operation of integration, up to an additive constant, is the inverse of the operation of differentiation. For this reason, the term ''integral'' may also refer to the related notion of the [[antiderivative]], a function {{mvar|F}} whose derivative is the given function {{mvar|f}}. In this case, it is called an [[indefinite integral]] and is written:\n:<math>F(x) = \\int f(x)\\,dx.</math>\n\nThe integrals discussed in this article are those termed ''definite integrals''. It is the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] that connects differentiation with the definite integral: if {{mvar|f}} is a continuous real-valued function defined on a [[closed interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, then, once an antiderivative {{mvar|F}} of {{mvar|f}} is known, the definite integral of {{mvar|f}} over that interval is given by\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b \\, f(x) dx = \\left[ F(x) \\right]_{a}^{b} = F(b) - F(a) \\, .</math>\n\nThe principles of integration were formulated independently by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in the late 17th century, who thought of the integral as an infinite sum of rectangles of [[infinitesimal]] width. [[Bernhard Riemann]] gave a rigorous mathematical definition of integrals. It is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a [[Curvilinear coordinates|curvilinear]] region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs. Beginning in the nineteenth century, more sophisticated notions of integrals began to appear, where the type of the function as well as the [[Domain of a function|domain]] over which the integration is performed has been generalised. A [[line integral]] is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is replaced by a [[curve]] connecting the two endpoints. In a [[surface integral]], the curve is replaced by a piece of a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] in [[three-dimensional space]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of calculus}}\n\n===Pre-calculus integration===\nThe first documented systematic technique capable of determining integrals is the [[method of exhaustion]] of the [[ancient Greek]] astronomer [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] (''ca.'' 370 BC), which sought to find areas and volumes by breaking them up into an infinite number of divisions for which the area or volume was known. This method was further developed and employed by [[Archimedes]] in the 3rd century BC and used to calculate areas for [[parabola]]s and an approximation to the [[area of a circle]].\n\nA similar method was independently developed in China around the 3rd century AD by [[Liu Hui]], who used it to find the area of the circle. This method was later used in the 5th century by Chinese father-and-son mathematicians [[Zu Chongzhi]] and [[Zu Geng (mathematician)|Zu Geng]] to find the volume of a sphere ({{harvnb|Shea | 2007}}; {{harvnb|Katz|2004|pp=125\u2013126}}).\n\nThe next significant advances in integral calculus did not begin to appear until the 17th century. At this time, the work of [[Bonaventura Cavalieri|Cavalieri]] with his [[method of Indivisibles]], and work by [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]], began to lay the foundations of modern calculus, with Cavalieri computing the integrals of {{math|''x''<sup>''n''</sup>}} up to degree {{math|''n'' {{=}} 9}} in [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]]. Further steps were made in the early 17th century by [[Isaac Barrow|Barrow]] and [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricelli]], who provided the first hints of a connection between integration and [[Differential calculus|differentiation]]. Barrow provided the first proof of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. [[John Wallis|Wallis]] generalized Cavalieri's method, computing integrals of {{mvar|x}} to a general power, including negative powers and fractional powers.\n\n===Newton and Leibniz===\nThe major advance in integration came in the 17th century with the independent discovery of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. The theorem demonstrates a connection between integration and differentiation. This connection, combined with the comparative ease of differentiation, can be exploited to calculate integrals. In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus allows one to solve a much broader class of problems. Equal in importance is the comprehensive mathematical framework that both Newton and Leibniz developed. Given the name infinitesimal calculus, it allowed for precise analysis of functions within continuous domains. This framework eventually became modern [[calculus]], whose notation for integrals is drawn directly from the work of Leibniz.\n<!--- Please, do not remove: helpful for verification\nThe last sentence originally said 'work of Newton and Leibniz', but for integrals, only Leibniz's notation is used. --->\n\n===Formalization===\nWhile Newton and Leibniz provided a systematic approach to integration, their work lacked a degree of [[Rigor#Mathematical rigour|rigour]]. [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] memorably attacked the vanishing increments used by Newton, calling them \"[[The Analyst#Content|ghosts of departed quantities]]\". Calculus acquired a firmer footing with the development of [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]]. Integration was first rigorously formalized, using limits, by [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]. Although all bounded piecewise continuous functions are Riemann-integrable on a bounded interval, subsequently more general functions were considered\u2014particularly in the context of [[Fourier analysis]]\u2014to which Riemann's definition does not apply, and [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]] formulated a [[#Lebesgue integral|different definition of integral]], founded in [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]] (a subfield of [[real analysis]]). Other definitions of integral, extending Riemann's and Lebesgue's approaches, were proposed. These approaches based on the real number system are the ones most common today, but alternative approaches exist, such as a definition of integral as the [[standard part]] of an infinite Riemann sum, based on the [[hyperreal number]] system.\n\n===Historical notation===\n[[Isaac Newton]] used a small vertical bar above a variable to indicate integration, or placed the variable inside a box. The vertical bar was easily confused with {{math|{{overset|'''.'''|''x''}}}} or {{math|''x''\u2032}}, which are used to indicate differentiation, and the box notation was difficult for printers to reproduce, so these notations were not widely adopted.\n\nThe modern notation for the indefinite integral was introduced by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1675 ({{Harvnb|Burton|1988|loc=p.&nbsp;359}}; {{Harvnb|Leibniz|1899|loc=p.&nbsp;154}}). He adapted the [[integral symbol]], '''\u222b''', from the letter ''\u017f'' ([[long s]]), standing for ''summa'' (written as ''\u017fumma''; Latin for \"sum\" or \"total\"). The modern notation for the definite integral, with limits above and below the integral sign, was first used by [[Joseph Fourier]] in ''M\u00e9moires'' of the French Academy around 1819\u201320, reprinted in his book of 1822 ({{Harvnb|Cajori|1929|loc=pp.&nbsp;249\u2013250}}; {{Harvnb|Fourier|1822|loc=\u00a7231}}).\n\n==Applications==\n{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}\n\nIntegrals are used extensively in many areas of mathematics as well as in many other areas that rely on mathematics.\n\nFor example, in [[probability theory]], integrals are used to determine the probability of some [[random variable]] falling within a certain range. Moreover, the integral under an entire [[probability density function]] must equal 1, which provides a test of whether a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with no negative values could be a density function or not.\n\nIntegrals can be used for computing the [[area]] of a two-dimensional region that has a curved boundary, as well as [[Volume integral|computing the volume]] of a three-dimensional object that has a curved boundary.\n\nIntegrals are also used in physics, in areas like [[kinematics]] to find quantities like [[displacement (vector)|displacement]], [[time]], and [[velocity]]. For example, in rectilinear motion, the displacement of an object over the time interval <math>[a,b]</math> is given by: \n\n:<math>x(b)-x(a) = \\int_a^b v(t) \\,dt,</math>\n\nwhere <math>v(t)</math> is the velocity expressed as a function of time. The work done by a force <math>F(x)</math> (given as a function of position) from an initial position <math>A</math> to a final position <math>B</math> is:\n\n:<math>W_{A\\rightarrow B} = \\int_A^B F(x)\\,dx.</math>\n\nIntegrals are also used in [[thermodynamics]], where [[thermodynamic integration]] is used to calculate the difference in free energy between two given states.\n\n==Terminology and notation==\n\n===Standard===\nThe integral with respect to {{mvar|x}} of a [[real-valued function]] {{math|''f''(''x'')}} of a real variable {{mvar|x}} on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is written as\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx</math>.\n\nThe integral sign {{math|\u222b}} represents integration. The symbol {{mvar|dx}}, called the [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] of the variable {{mvar|x}}, indicates that the variable of integration is {{mvar|x}}. The function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} to be integrated is called the integrand. The symbol {{mvar|dx}} is separated from the integrand by a space (as shown). If a function has an integral, it is said to be integrable. The points {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b|}} are called the limits of the integral. An integral where the limits are specified is called a definite integral. The integral is said to be over the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.\n\nIf the integral goes from a finite value ''a'' to the upper limit infinity, the integral expresses the limit of the integral from ''a'' to a value ''b'' as ''b'' goes to infinity. If the value of the integral gets closer and closer to a finite value, the integral is said to [[convergence (mathematics)|converge]] to that value. If not, the integral is said to diverge.\n\nWhen the limits are omitted, as in\n:<math>\\int f(x) \\,dx,</math>\nthe integral is called an indefinite integral, which represents a class of functions (the [[antiderivative]]) whose derivative is the integrand. The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] relates the evaluation of definite integrals to indefinite integrals. Occasionally, limits of integration are omitted for definite integrals when the same limits occur repeatedly in a particular context. Usually, the author will make this convention clear at the beginning of the relevant text.\n\nThere are several extensions of the notation for integrals to encompass integration on unbounded domains and/or in multiple dimensions (see later sections of this article).\n\n=== Meaning of the symbol ''dx'' ===\nHistorically, the symbol ''dx'' was taken to represent an infinitesimally \"small piece\" of the independent variable ''x'' to be multiplied by the integrand and summed up in an infinite sense. While this notion is still heuristically useful, later mathematicians have deemed infinitesimal quantities to be untenable from the standpoint of the real number system.<ref>In the 20th century, [[Non-standard analysis|nonstandard analysis]] was developed as a new approach to calculus that incorporates a rigorous concept of infinitesimals by using an expanded number system called the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreal numbers]]. Though placed on a sound axiomatic footing and of interest in its own right as a new area of investigation, nonstandard analysis remains somewhat controversial from a pedagogical standpoint, with proponents pointing out the intuitive nature of infinitesimals for beginning students of calculus and opponents criticizing the logical complexity of the system as a whole.</ref> In introductory calculus, the expression ''dx'' is therefore not assigned an independent meaning; instead, it is viewed as part of the symbol for integration and serves as its delimiter on the right side of the expression being integrated. \n\nIn more sophisticated contexts, ''dx'' can have its own significance, the meaning of which depending on the particular area of mathematics being discussed. When used in one of these ways, the original Leibnitz notation is co-opted to apply to a generalization of the original definition of the integral. Some common interpretations of ''dx'' include: an integrator function in [[Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral|Riemann-Stieltjes integration]] (indicated by ''d\u03b1''(''x'') in general), a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] in Lebesgue theory (indicated by ''d\u03bc'' in general), or a [[differential form]] in exterior calculus (indicated by <math>dx^{i_1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^{i_k}</math> in general). In the last case, even the letter ''d'' has an independent meaning \u2014 as the [[exterior derivative]] operator on differential forms.\n\nConversely, in advanced settings, it is not uncommon to leave out ''dx'' when only the simple Riemann integral is being used, or the exact type of integral is immaterial. For instance, one might write <math display=\"inline\">\\int_a^b (c_1f+c_2g) = c_1\\int_a^b f + c_2\\int_a^b g </math> to express the linearity of the integral, a property shared by the Riemann integral and all generalizations thereof.\n\n===Variants===\nIn [[modern Arabic mathematical notation]], a reflected integral symbol [[File:ArabicIntegralSign.svg|16px]] is used instead of the symbol {{math|\u222b}}, since the Arabic script and mathematical expressions go right to left.<ref>{{Harv|W3C|2006}}.</ref> Some authors, particularly of European origin, use an upright \"d\" to indicate the variable of integration (i.e., {{math|d''x''}} instead of {{math|''dx''}}), since properly speaking, \"d\" is not a variable. Also, the symbol {{mvar|dx}} is not always placed after {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, as for instance in\n:<math>\\int\\limits_0^1 \\frac{3\\ dx}{x^2+1}\\quad</math> or <math>\\quad\\int_{0}^{1} dx \\int_{0}^{1} dy\\ e^{-(x^2+y^2)} </math>.\nIn the first expression, the differential is treated as an infinitesimal \"multiplicative\" factor, formally following a \"commutative property\" when \"multiplied\" by the expression 3/(''x''<sup>2</sup>+1). In the second expression, showing the differentials first highlights and clarifies the variables that are being integrated with respect to, a practice particularly popular with physicists.\n\n==Interpretations of the integral==\nIntegrals appear in many practical situations. If a swimming pool is rectangular with a flat bottom, then from its length, width, and depth we can easily determine the volume of water it can contain (to fill it), the area of its surface (to cover it), and the length of its edge (to rope it). But if it is oval with a rounded bottom, all of these quantities call for integrals. Practical approximations may suffice for such trivial examples, but [[precision engineering]] (of any discipline) requires exact and rigorous values for these elements.\n\n[[File:Integral approximations.svg|thumb|right|Approximations to integral of {{radic|{{mvar|x}}}} from 0 to 1, with 5 <span style=\"color:#fec200\">\u25a0</span>&nbsp; (yellow) right endpoint partitions and 12 <span style=\"color:#009246\">\u25a0</span>&nbsp; (green) left endpoint partitions|alt=Integral approximation example]]\nTo start off, consider the curve {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} between {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} with {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''}}}} (see figure). We ask:\n:What is the area under the function {{mvar|f}}, in the interval from 0 to 1?\nand call this (yet unknown) area the (definite) '''integral''' of {{mvar|f}}. The notation for this integral will be\n:<math>\\int_0^1 \\sqrt{x}\\ dx.</math>\n\nAs a first approximation, look at the unit square given by the sides {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} to {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(0) {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(1) {{=}} 1}}. Its area is exactly 1. Actually, the true value of the integral must be somewhat less than 1. Decreasing the width of the approximation rectangles and increasing the number of rectangles gives a better result; so cross the interval in five steps, using the approximation points 0, 1/5, 2/5, and so on to 1. Fit a box for each step using the right end height of each curve piece, thus {{math|{{sqrt|1/5}}}}, {{math|{{sqrt|2/5}}}}, and so on to {{math|{{sqrt|1}} {{=}} 1}}. Summing the areas of these rectangles, we get a better approximation for the sought integral, namely\n:<math>\\textstyle \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5}}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}-0\\right)+\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}}\\left(\\frac{2}{5}-\\frac{1}{5}\\right)+\\cdots+\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{5}}\\left(\\frac{5}{5}-\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\approx 0.7497.</math>\n\nWe are taking a sum of finitely many function values of {{mvar|f}}, multiplied with the differences of two subsequent approximation points. We can easily see that the approximation is still too large. Using more steps produces a closer approximation, but will always be too high and will never be exact. Alternatively, replacing these subintervals by ones with the left end height of each piece, we will get an approximation that is too low: for example, with twelve such subintervals we will get an approximate value for the area of 0.6203. \n\nThe key idea is the transition from adding ''finitely many'' differences of approximation points multiplied by their respective function values to using infinitely many fine, or ''[[infinitesimal]]'' steps. When this transition is completed in the above example, it turns out that the area under the curve within the stated bounds is 2/3.\n\nThe notation\n:<math>\\int f(x)\\ dx</math>\nconceives the integral as a weighted sum, denoted by the elongated {{mvar|s}}, of function values, {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, multiplied by infinitesimal step widths, the so-called ''differentials'', denoted by {{mvar|dx}}.\n\n<!-- Note: Today's limits of integration were not part of the notation until much later, due to Fourier. -->Historically, after the failure of early efforts to rigorously interpret infinitesimals, Riemann formally defined integrals as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of weighted sums, so that the {{mvar|dx}} suggested the limit of a difference (namely, the interval width). Shortcomings of Riemann's dependence on intervals and continuity motivated newer definitions, especially the [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integral]], which is founded on an ability to extend the idea of \"measure\" in much more flexible ways. Thus the notation\n:<math>\\int_A f(x)\\ d\\mu</math>\nrefers to a weighted sum in which the function values are partitioned, with {{mvar|\u03bc}} measuring the weight to be assigned to each value. Here {{mvar|A}} denotes the region of integration.\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 300\n<!-- Extra parameters -->\n| header = Darboux sums\n| header_align = center\n| header_background = \n| footer = \n| footer_align = \n| footer_background = \n| background color =\n\n|image1=Riemann Integration and Darboux Upper Sums.gif\n|width1=300\n|caption1=<div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Darboux upper sums of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup></div>}}\n|alt1=Upper Darboux sum example\n\n|image2=Riemann Integration and Darboux Lower Sums.gif\n|width2=300\n|caption2=<div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Darboux lower sums of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup></div>}}\n|alt2=Lower Darboux sum example\n}}\n\n==Formal definitions==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n\n| image1    = Integral Riemann sum.png\n| alt1      = Riemann integral approximation example\n| caption1  = <div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Integral example with irregular partitions (largest marked in red)</div>\n\n| image2    = Riemann sum convergence.png\n| alt2      = Riemann sum convergence\n| caption2  = <div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Riemann sums converging</div>\n}}\n\nThere are many ways of formally defining an integral, not all of which are equivalent. The differences exist mostly to deal with differing special cases which may not be integrable under other definitions, but also occasionally for pedagogical reasons. The most commonly used definitions of integral are Riemann integrals and Lebesgue integrals.\n\n===Riemann integral===\n{{Main|Riemann integral}}\n\nThe Riemann integral is defined in terms of [[Riemann sum]]s of functions with respect to ''tagged partitions'' of an interval.<ref>{{MathWorld |title=Riemann Sum |id=RiemannSum}}</ref> Let {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} be a [[Interval (mathematics)|closed interval]] of the real line; then a ''tagged partition'' of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is a finite sequence\n\n:<math> a = x_0 \\le t_1 \\le x_1 \\le t_2 \\le x_2 \\le \\cdots \\le x_{n-1} \\le t_n \\le x_n = b . \\,\\!</math>\n\nThis partitions the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} into {{mvar|n}} sub-intervals {{math|[''x''<sub>''i''\u22121</sub>, ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>]}} indexed by {{mvar|i}}, each of which is \"tagged\" with a distinguished point {{math|''t''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2208 [''x''<sub>''i''\u22121</sub>, ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>]}}. A ''Riemann sum'' of a function {{mvar|f}} with respect to such a tagged partition is defined as\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(t_i) \\Delta_i ; </math>\nthus each term of the sum is the area of a rectangle with height equal to the function value at the distinguished point of the given sub-interval, and width the same as the sub-interval width. Let {{math|\u0394<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>\u2212''x''<sub>''i''\u22121</sub>}} be the width of sub-interval {{mvar|i}}; then the ''mesh'' of such a tagged partition is the width of the largest sub-interval formed by the partition, {{math|max<sub>''i''{{=}}1...''n''</sub> \u0394<sub>''i''</sub>}}. The ''Riemann integral'' of a function {{mvar|f}} over the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is equal to {{mvar|S}} if:\n:For all {{math|''\u03b5'' &gt; 0}} there exists {{math|''\u03b4'' &gt; 0}} such that, for any tagged partition {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} with mesh less than {{mvar|\u03b4}}, we have\n::<math>\\left| S - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(t_i)\\Delta_i \\right| < \\varepsilon.</math>\nWhen the chosen tags give the maximum (respectively, minimum) value of each interval, the Riemann sum becomes an upper (respectively, lower) [[Darboux integral|Darboux sum]], suggesting the close connection between the Riemann integral and the [[Darboux integral]].\n\n===Lebesgue integral===\n{{Main|Lebesgue integration}}\n[[Image:RandLintegrals.svg|thumb|250px|Riemann\u2013Darboux's integration (top) and Lebesgue integration (bottom)|alt=Comparison of Riemann and Lebesgue integrals]]\n\nIt is often of interest, both in theory and applications, to be able to pass to the limit under the integral. For instance, a sequence of functions can frequently be constructed that approximate, in a suitable sense, the solution to a problem. Then the integral of the solution function should be the limit of the integrals of the approximations. However, many functions that can be obtained as limits are not Riemann-integrable, and so such limit theorems do not hold with the Riemann integral. Therefore, it is of great importance to have a definition of the integral that allows a wider class of functions to be integrated {{Harv|Rudin|1987}}.\n\nSuch an integral is the Lebesgue integral, that exploits the following fact to enlarge the class of integrable functions: if the values of a function are rearranged over the domain, the integral of a function should remain the same. Thus [[Henri Lebesgue]] introduced the integral bearing his name, explaining this integral thus in a letter to [[Paul Montel]]:\n{{quote|I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected in my pocket. I take the bills and coins out of my pocket and give them to the creditor in the order I find them until I have reached the total sum. This is the Riemann integral. But I can proceed differently. After I have taken all the money out of my pocket I order the bills and coins according to identical values and then I pay the several heaps one after the other to the creditor. This is my integral.|{{harvtxt|Siegmund-Schultze|2008}}}}\n\nAs {{Harvtxt|Folland|1984|loc=p.&nbsp;56}} puts it, \"To compute the Riemann integral of {{mvar|f}}, one partitions the domain {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} into subintervals\", while in the Lebesgue integral, \"one is in effect partitioning the range of {{mvar|f}} \". The definition of the Lebesgue integral thus begins with a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]], \u03bc. In the simplest case, the [[Lebesgue measure]] {{math|''\u03bc''(''A'')}} of an interval {{math|''A'' {{=}} [''a'', ''b'']}} is its width, {{math|''b'' \u2212 ''a''}}, so that the Lebesgue integral agrees with the (proper) Riemann integral when both exist. In more complicated cases, the sets being measured can be highly fragmented, with no continuity and no resemblance to intervals.\n\nUsing the \"partitioning the range of {{mvar|f}} \" philosophy, the integral of a non-negative function {{math|''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}} should be the sum over {{mvar|t}} of the areas between a thin horizontal strip between {{math|1=''y'' = ''t''}} and {{math|1=''y'' = ''t'' + ''dt''}}. This area is just {{math|''\u03bc''{ ''x'' : ''f''(''x'') > ''t''}\u2009''dt''}}. Let {{math|1=''f''<sup>\u2217</sup>(''t'') = ''\u03bc''{ ''x'' : ''f''(''x'') > ''t''}}}. The Lebesgue integral of {{mvar|f}} is then defined by {{harv|Lieb|Loss|2001}}\n:<math>\\int f = \\int_0^\\infty f^*(t)\\,dt</math>\nwhere the integral on the right is an ordinary improper Riemann integral ({{math|''f''<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is a strictly decreasing positive function, and therefore has a [[well-defined]] improper Riemann integral). For a suitable class of functions (the [[measurable function]]s) this defines the Lebesgue integral.\n\nA general measurable function {{mvar|f}} is Lebesgue-integrable if the sum of the absolute values of the areas of the regions between the graph of {{mvar|f}} and the {{mvar|x}}-axis is finite:\n:<math>\\int_E |f|\\,d\\mu < + \\infty.</math>\nIn that case, the integral is, as in the Riemannian case, the difference between the area above the {{mvar|x}}-axis and the area below the {{mvar|x}}-axis:\n:<math>\\int_E f \\,d\\mu = \\int_E f^+ \\,d\\mu - \\int_E f^- \\,d\\mu</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{3}\n & f^+(x) &&{}={} \\max \\{f(x),0\\} &&{}={} \\begin{cases}\n               f(x), & \\text{if } f(x) > 0, \\\\\n               0, & \\text{otherwise,}\n             \\end{cases}\\\\\n & f^-(x) &&{}={} \\max \\{-f(x),0\\} &&{}={} \\begin{cases}\n               -f(x), & \\text{if } f(x) < 0, \\\\\n               0, & \\text{otherwise.}\n             \\end{cases}\n\\end{alignat}</math>\n\n===Other integrals===\nAlthough the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals are the most widely used definitions of the integral, a number of others exist, including:\n* The [[Darboux integral]], which is constructed using Darboux sums and is equivalent to a [[Riemann integral]], meaning that a function is Darboux-integrable if and only if it is Riemann-integrable. Darboux integrals have the advantage of being simpler to define than Riemann integrals.\n* The [[Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral]], an extension of the Riemann integral.\n* The [[Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integration|Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integral]], further developed by [[Johann Radon]], which generalizes the [[Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral|Riemann\u2013Stieltjes]] and [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integrals]].\n* The [[Daniell integral]], which subsumes the Lebesgue integral and [[Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integration|Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integral]] without the dependence on [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s.\n* The [[Haar integral]], used for integration on locally compact topological groups, introduced by [[Alfr\u00e9d Haar]] in 1933.\n* The [[Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral]], variously defined by [[Arnaud Denjoy]], [[Oskar Perron]], and (most elegantly, as the gauge integral) [[Jaroslav Kurzweil]], and developed by [[Ralph Henstock]].\n* The [[It\u00f4 integral]] and [[Stratonovich integral]], which define integration with respect to [[semimartingale]]s such as [[Wiener process|Brownian motion]].\n<!--* The [[Darboux integral]], equivalent to the Riemann integral.-->\n<!--* The [[Haar integral]], which is the Lebesgue integral with [[Haar measure]].-->\n* The [[Young integral]], which is a kind of Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral with respect to certain functions of [[Bounded variation|unbounded variation]].\n* The [[rough path]] integral, which is defined for functions equipped with some additional \"rough path\" structure and generalizes stochastic integration against both [[semimartingale]]s and processes such as the [[fractional Brownian motion]].\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Linearity===\nThe collection of Riemann-integrable functions on a closed interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} forms a [[vector space]] under the operations of [[pointwise addition]] and multiplication by a scalar, and the operation of integration\n:<math> f \\mapsto \\int_a^b f(x) \\; dx</math>\n<!--- redundant\nfor an integrable [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{mvar|f}} on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}\n--->\nis a [[linear functional]] on this vector space. Thus, firstly, the collection of integrable functions is closed under taking [[linear combination]]s; and, secondly, the integral of a linear combination is the linear combination of the integrals,\n\n<!--- leftover from the past text; redundant\nFor example, in Riemann integration, if {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are [[real number|real-valued]] integrable functions on a [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, and {{mvar|\u03b1}} and {{mvar|\u03b2}} are real numbers, then the function {{math|''\u03b1f'' + ''\u03b2g''}} defined by {{math|(''\u03b1f'' + ''\u03b2g'')(''x'') {{=}} ''\u03b1f''(''x'') + ''\u03b2g''(''x'')}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is integrable, with\n--->\n:<math> \\int_a^b (\\alpha f + \\beta g)(x) \\, dx = \\alpha \\int_a^b f(x) \\,dx + \\beta \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx. \\,</math>\n\nSimilarly, the set of [[real number|real]]-valued Lebesgue-integrable functions on a given [[Measure (mathematics)|measure space]] {{mvar|E}} with measure {{mvar|\u03bc}} is closed under taking linear combinations and hence form a vector space, and the Lebesgue integral\n\n: <math> f\\mapsto \\int_E f \\, d\\mu </math>\n\nis a linear functional on this vector space, so that\n\n:<math> \\int_E (\\alpha f + \\beta g) \\, d\\mu = \\alpha \\int_E f \\, d\\mu + \\beta \\int_E g \\, d\\mu. </math>\n\nMore generally, consider the vector space of all [[measurable function]]s on a measure space {{math|(''E'',''\u03bc'')}}, taking values in a [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] [[complete metric space|complete]] [[topological vector space]] {{mvar|V}} over a locally compact [[Topological ring|topological field]] {{math|''K'', ''f'' : ''E'' \u2192 ''V''}}. Then one may define an abstract integration map assigning to each function {{mvar|f}} an element of {{mvar|V}} or the symbol {{math|''\u221e''}},\n:<math> f\\mapsto\\int_E f \\,d\\mu, \\,</math>\nthat is compatible with linear combinations. In this situation, the linearity holds for the subspace of functions whose integral is an element of {{mvar|V}} (i.e. \"finite\"). The most important special cases arise when {{mvar|K}} is {{math|'''R'''}}, {{math|'''C'''}}, or a finite extension of the field {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} of [[p-adic number]]s, and {{mvar|V}} is a finite-dimensional vector space over {{mvar|K}}, and when {{math|''K'' {{=}} '''C'''}} and {{mvar|V}} is a complex [[Hilbert space]].\n\nLinearity, together with some natural continuity properties and normalisation for a certain class of \"simple\" functions, may be used to give an alternative definition of the integral. This is the approach of [[Daniell integral|Daniell]] for the case of real-valued functions on a set {{mvar|X}}, generalized by [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] to functions with values in a locally compact topological vector space. See {{Harv|Hildebrandt|1953}} for an axiomatic characterisation of the integral.\n\n===Inequalities===\nA number of general inequalities hold for Riemann-integrable [[function (mathematics)|functions]] defined on a [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and can be generalized to other notions of integral (Lebesgue and Daniell).\n\n* ''Upper and lower bounds.'' An integrable function {{mvar|f}} on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, is necessarily [[bounded function|bounded]] on that interval. Thus there are [[real number]]s {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|M}} so that {{math|''m'' \u2264 ''f''\u2009(''x'') \u2264 ''M''}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. Since the lower and upper sums of {{mvar|f}} over {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} are therefore bounded by, respectively, {{math|''m''(''b'' \u2212 ''a'')}} and {{math|''M''(''b'' \u2212 ''a'')}}, it follows that\n:: <math> m(b - a) \\leq \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\leq M(b - a). </math>\n\n* ''Inequalities between functions.'' If {{math|''f''(''x'') \u2264 ''g''(''x'')}} for each {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} then each of the upper and lower sums of {{mvar|f}} is bounded above by the upper and lower sums, respectively, of {{mvar|g}}.

The integral\n:<math> \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx </math>\nover an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is defined if {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}}.

In some cases such integrals may be defined by considering the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a [[sequence]] of proper [[Riemann integral]]s on progressively larger intervals.\n\nIf the interval is unbounded, for instance at its upper end, then the improper integral is the limit as that endpoint goes to infinity.\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{\\infty} f(x)\\,dx = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx</math>\nIf the integrand is only defined or finite on a half-open interval, for instance {{math|<nowiki>(</nowiki>''a'', ''b''<nowiki>]</nowiki>}}, then again a limit may provide a finite result.\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\int_{a+\\epsilon}^{b} f(x)\\,dx</math>\n\nThat is, the improper integral is the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of proper integrals as one endpoint of the interval of integration approaches either a specified [[real number]], or {{math|\u221e}}, or {{math|\u2212\u221e}}. In more complicated cases, limits are required at both endpoints, or at interior points.\n\n===Multiple integration===\n{{Main|Multiple integral}}\n[[File:Volume under surface.png|right|thumb|Double integral as volume under a surface]]\nJust as the definite integral of a positive function of one variable represents the [[area]] of the region between the graph of the function and the ''x''-axis, the ''double integral'' of a positive function of two variables represents the [[volume]] of the region between the surface defined by the function and the plane that contains its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]]. For example, a function in two dimensions depends on two real variables, ''x'' and ''y'', and the integral of a function ''f'' over the rectangle ''R'' given as the [[Cartesian product]] of two intervals <math>R=[a,b]\\times [c,d]</math> can be written\n\n:<math>\\int_R f(x,y)\\,dA</math>\n\nwhere the differential {{math|''dA''}} indicates that integration is taken with respect to area. This [[double integral]] can be defined using [[Riemann sum]]s, and represents the (signed) volume under the graph of {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'',''y'')}} over the domain ''R''. Under suitable conditions (e.g., if ''f'' is continuous), then [[Fubini's theorem]] guarantees that this integral can be expressed as an equivalent iterated integral\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b\\left[\\int_c^d f(x,y)\\,dy\\right]\\,dx.</math>\n\nThis reduces the problem of computing a double integral to computing one-dimensional integrals. Because of this, another notation for the integral over ''R'' uses a double integral sign:\n:<math>\\iint_R f(x,y) dA.</math>\n\nIntegration over more general domains is possible. The integral of a function ''f'', with respect to volume, over a subset ''D'' of  \u211d<sup>n</sup> is denoted by notation such as\n\n:<math>\\int_D f(\\mathbf x)d^n\\mathbf x,\\quad \\int_D f\\,dV</math>\n\nor similar. See [[volume integral]].\n\n===Line integrals===\n{{Main|Line integral}}\n[[File:Line-Integral.gif|right|thumb|A line integral sums together elements along a curve.]]\nThe concept of an integral can be extended to more general domains of integration, such as curved lines and surfaces. Such integrals are known as line integrals and surface integrals respectively. These have important applications in physics, as when dealing with [[vector field]]s.\n\nA ''line integral'' (sometimes called a ''path integral'') is an integral where the [[function (mathematics)|function]] to be integrated is evaluated along a [[curve]]. Various different line integrals are in use. In the case of a closed curve it is also called a ''contour integral''.\n\nThe function to be integrated may be a [[scalar field]] or a [[vector field]]. The value of the line integral is the sum of values of the field at all points on the curve, weighted by some scalar function on the curve (commonly [[arc length]] or, for a vector field, the [[Inner product space|scalar product]] of the vector field with a [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] vector in the curve). This weighting distinguishes the line integral from simpler integrals defined on [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s. Many simple formulas in physics have natural continuous analogs in terms of line integrals; for example, the fact that [[Mechanical work|work]] is equal to [[force]], {{math|'''F'''}}, multiplied by displacement, {{math|'''s'''}}, may be expressed (in terms of vector quantities) as:\n:<math>W=\\mathbf F\\cdot\\mathbf s.</math>\nFor an object moving along a path {{mvar|''C''}} in a [[vector field]] {{math|'''F'''}} such as an [[electric field]] or [[gravitational field]], the total work done by the field on the object is obtained by summing up the differential work done in moving from {{math|'''s'''}} to {{math|'''s''' + ''d'''''s'''}}. This gives the line integral\n:<math>W=\\int_C \\mathbf F\\cdot d\\mathbf s.</math>\n\n===Surface integrals===\n{{Main|Surface integral}}\n[[File:Surface integral illustration.svg|right|thumb|The definition of surface integral relies on splitting the surface into small surface elements.]]\nA ''surface integral'' is a definite integral taken over a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] (which may be a curved set in [[space]]); it can be thought of as the [[Multiple integral|double integral]] analog of the [[line integral]]. The function to be integrated may be a [[scalar field]] or a [[vector field]]. The value of the surface integral is the sum of the field at all points on the surface. This can be achieved by splitting the surface into surface elements, which provide the partitioning for Riemann sums.\n\nFor an example of applications of surface integrals, consider a vector field {{math|'''v'''}} on a surface {{math|''S''}}; that is, for each point {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''S''}}, {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} is a vector. Imagine that we have a fluid flowing through {{math|''S''}}, such that {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} determines the velocity of the fluid at {{mvar|x}}. The [[flux]] is defined as the quantity of fluid flowing through {{math|''S''}} in unit amount of time. To find the flux, we need to take the [[dot product]] of {{math|'''v'''}} with the unit [[Normal (geometry)|surface normal]] to {{math|''S''}} at each point, which will give us a scalar field, which we integrate over the surface:\n:<math>\\int_S {\\mathbf v}\\cdot \\,d{\\mathbf {S}}.</math>\nThe fluid flux in this example may be from a physical fluid such as water or air, or from electrical or magnetic flux. Thus surface integrals have applications in physics, particularly with the [[classical theory]] of [[electromagnetism]].\n\n===Contour integrals===\n\nIn [[complex analysis]], the integrand is a [[complex-valued function]] of a complex variable {{mvar|z}} instead of a real function of a real variable {{mvar|x}}. When a complex function is integrated along a curve <math>\\gamma</math> in the complex plane, the integral is denoted as follows\n\n:<math>\\int_{\\gamma} f(z)\\,dz</math>.\n\nThis is known as a [[contour integral]].\n\n===Integrals of differential forms===\n{{Main|differential form}}\nA [[differential form]] is a mathematical concept in the fields of [[multivariable calculus]], [[differential topology]], and [[tensor]]s. Differential forms are organized by degree. For example, a one-form is a weighted sum of the differentials of the coordinates, such as:\n:<math>E(x,y,z)\\,dx + F(x,y,z)\\,dy + G(x,y,z)\\, dz</math>\nwhere ''E'', ''F'', ''G'' are functions in three dimensions. A differential one-form can be integrated over an oriented path, and the resulting integral is just another way of writing a line integral. Here the basic differentials ''dx'', ''dy'', ''dz'' measure infinitesimal oriented lengths parallel to the three coordinate axes.\n\nA differential two-form is a sum of the form\n:<math>G(x,y,z)dx\\wedge dy + E(x,y,z)dy\\wedge dz + F(x,y,z)dz\\wedge dx.</math>\nHere the basic two-forms <math>dx\\wedge dy, dz\\wedge dx, dy\\wedge dz</math> measure oriented areas parallel to the coordinate two-planes. The symbol <math>\\wedge</math> denotes the [[wedge product]], which is similar to the [[cross product]] in the sense that the wedge product of two forms representing oriented lengths represents an oriented area. A two-form can be integrated over an oriented surface, and the resulting integral is equivalent to the surface integral giving the flux of <math>E\\mathbf i+F\\mathbf j+G\\mathbf k</math>.\n\nUnlike the cross product, and the three-dimensional vector calculus, the wedge product and the calculus of differential forms makes sense in arbitrary dimension and on more general manifolds (curves, surfaces, and their higher-dimensional analogs). The [[exterior derivative]] plays the role of the [[gradient]] and [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of vector calculus, and [[Stokes' theorem]] simultaneously generalizes the three theorems of vector calculus: the [[divergence theorem]], [[Green's theorem]], and the [[Kelvin-Stokes theorem]].\n\n===Summations===\nThe discrete equivalent of integration is [[summation]]. Summations and integrals can be put on the same foundations using the theory of [[Lebesgue integral]]s or [[time scale calculus]].\n\n==Computation==\n\n===Analytical===\nThe most basic technique for computing definite integrals of one real variable is based on the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. Let {{math|''f''(''x'')}} be the function of {{mvar|x}} to be integrated over a given interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. Then, find an antiderivative of {{mvar|f}}; that is, a function {{mvar|F}} such that {{math|''F''\u2032 {{=}} ''f''}} on the interval. Provided the integrand and integral have no [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] on the path of integration, by the fundamental theorem of calculus,\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx=F(b)-F(a).</math>\n\nThe integral is not actually the antiderivative, but the fundamental theorem provides a way to use antiderivatives to evaluate definite integrals.\n\nThe most difficult step is usually to find the antiderivative of {{mvar|f}}. It is rarely possible to glance at a function and write down its antiderivative. More often, it is necessary to use one of the many techniques that have been developed to evaluate integrals. Most of these techniques rewrite one integral as a different one which is hopefully more tractable. Techniques include:\n* [[Integration by substitution]]\n* [[Integration by parts]]\n* [[Inverse function integration]]\n* [[Order of integration (calculus)|Changing the order of integration]]\n* [[trigonometric substitution|Integration by trigonometric substitution]]\n* [[Tangent half-angle substitution]]\n* [[Partial fractions in integration|Integration by partial fractions]]\n* [[Integration by reduction formulae]]\n* [[Integration using parametric derivatives]]\n* [[Integration using Euler's formula]]\n* [[Euler substitution]]\n* [[Differentiation under the integral sign]]\n* [[Methods of contour integration|Contour integration]]\nAlternative methods exist to compute more complex integrals. Many [[nonelementary integral]]s can be expanded in a [[Taylor series]] and integrated term by term. Occasionally, the resulting infinite series can be summed analytically. The method of convolution using [[Meijer G-function]]s can also be used, assuming that the integrand can be written as a product of Meijer G-functions. There are also many less common ways of calculating definite integrals; for instance, [[Parseval's identity]] can be used to transform an integral over a rectangular region into an infinite sum. Occasionally, an integral can be evaluated by a trick; for an example of this, see [[Gaussian integral]].\n\nComputations of volumes of [[solid of revolution|solids of revolution]] can usually be done with [[disk integration]] or [[shell integration]].\n\nSpecific results which have been worked out by various techniques are collected in the [[Lists of integrals|list of integrals]].\n\n===Symbolic===\n{{Main|Symbolic integration}}\n\nMany problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering involve integration where an explicit formula for the integral is desired. Extensive [[Lists of integrals|tables of integrals]] have been compiled and published over the years for this purpose. With the spread of computers, many professionals, educators, and students have turned to [[computer algebra system]]s that are specifically designed to perform difficult or tedious tasks, including integration. Symbolic integration has been one of the motivations for the development of the first such systems, like [[Macsyma]].\n\nA major mathematical difficulty in symbolic integration is that in many cases, a closed formula for the antiderivative of a rather simple-looking function does not exist. For instance, it is known that the antiderivatives of the functions {{math|exp(''x''<sup>2</sup>), ''x''<sup>''x''</sup>}} and {{math|(sin ''x'')/''x''}} cannot be expressed in the closed form involving only [[rational function|rational]] and [[exponential function|exponential]] functions, [[logarithm]], [[trigonometric functions]] and [[inverse trigonometric functions]], and the operations of multiplication and composition; in other words, none of the three given functions is integrable in [[elementary function]]s, which are the functions which may be built from  rational functions, [[Root of a function|roots of a polynomial]], logarithm, and exponential functions. The [[Risch algorithm]] provides a general criterion to determine whether the antiderivative of an elementary function is elementary, and, if it is, to compute it. Unfortunately, it turns out that functions with closed expressions of antiderivatives are the exception rather than the rule. Consequently, computerized algebra systems have no hope of being able to find an antiderivative for a randomly constructed elementary function. On the positive side, if the 'building blocks' for antiderivatives are fixed in advance, it may be still be possible to decide whether the antiderivative of a given function can be expressed using these blocks and operations of multiplication and composition, and to find the symbolic answer whenever it exists. The [[Risch algorithm]], implemented in [[Mathematica]] and other [[computer algebra system]]s, does just that for functions and antiderivatives built from  rational functions, [[Nth root|radicals]], logarithm, and exponential functions.\n\nSome special integrands occur often enough to warrant special study. In particular, it may be useful to have, in the set of antiderivatives, the [[special functions]] (like the [[Legendre function]]s, the [[hypergeometric function]], the [[gamma function]], the [[incomplete gamma function]] and so on&nbsp;\u2014 see [[Symbolic integration]] for more details). Extending the Risch's algorithm to include such functions is possible but challenging and has been an active research subject.\n\nMore recently a new approach has emerged, using [[D-finite function|''D''-finite functions]], which are the solutions of [[linear differential equation]]s with polynomial coefficients. Most of the elementary and special functions are ''D''-finite, and the integral of a ''D''-finite function is also a ''D''-finite function. This provides an algorithm to express the antiderivative of a ''D''-finite function as the solution of a differential equation.\n\nThis theory also allows one to compute the definite integral of a ''D''-function as the sum of a series given by the first coefficients, and provides an algorithm to compute any coefficient.<ref>[http://algo.inria.fr/chyzak/mgfun.html Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chyzak's Mgfun Project: Introduction to the Package Mgfun and Related Packages]</ref>\n\n===Numerical===\n{{Main|Numerical integration}}\n\nSome integrals found in real applications can be computed by closed-form antiderivatives. Others are not so accommodating. Some antiderivatives do not have closed forms, some closed forms require special functions that themselves are a challenge to compute, and others are so complex that finding the exact answer is too slow. This motivates the study and application of numerical approximations of integrals. This subject, called ''numerical integration'' or ''numerical quadrature'', arose early in the study of integration for the purpose of making hand calculations. The development of general-purpose computers made numerical integration more practical and drove a desire for improvements. The goals of numerical integration are accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and generality, and sophisticated modern methods can vastly outperform a naive method by all four measures ({{Harvnb|Dahlquist|Bj\u00f6rck|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Kahaner|Moler|Nash|1989}}; {{Harvnb|Stoer|Bulirsch|2002}}).\n\nConsider, for example, the integral\n:<math> \\int_{-2}^{2} \\tfrac{1}{5} \\left( \\tfrac{1}{100}(322 + 3 x (98 + x (37 + x))) - 24 \\frac{x}{1+x^2} \\right) dx </math>\nwhich has the exact answer {{nowrap|94/25 {{=}} 3.76}}. (In ordinary practice, the answer is not known in advance, so an important task&nbsp;\u2014 not explored here&nbsp;\u2014 is to decide when an approximation is good enough.) A \u201ccalculus book\u201d approach divides the integration range into, say, 16 equal pieces, and computes function values.\n:{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color:white\"\n|+ Spaced function values\n|-\n!

The accuracy is not impressive, but calculus formally uses pieces of infinitesimal width, so initially this may seem little cause for concern. Indeed, repeatedly doubling the number of steps eventually produces an approximation of 3.76001. However, 2<sup>18</sup> pieces are required, a great computational expense for such little accuracy; and a reach for greater accuracy can force steps so small that arithmetic precision becomes an obstacle.\n\nA better approach replaces the rectangles used in a Riemann sum with trapezoids. The [[trapezoid rule]] is almost as easy to calculate; it sums all 17 function values, but weights the first and last by one half, and again multiplies by the step width. This immediately improves the approximation to 3.76925, which is noticeably more accurate. Furthermore, only 2<sup>10</sup> pieces are needed to achieve 3.76000, substantially less computation than the rectangle method for comparable accuracy. The idea behind the trapezoid rule, that more accurate approximations to the function yield better approximations to the integral, can be carried further. [[Simpson's rule]] approximates the integrand by a piecewise quadratic function. Riemann sums, the trapezoid rule, and Simpson's rule are examples of a family of quadrature rules called [[Newton\u2013Cotes formulas]]. The degree {{math|''n''}} Newton\u2013Cotes quadrature rule approximates the polynomial on each subinterval by a degree {{math|''n''}} polynomial. This polynomial is chosen to interpolate the values of the function on the interval. Higher degree Newton-Cotes approximations can be more accurate, but they require more function evaluations (already Simpson's rule requires twice the function evaluations of the trapezoid rule), and they can suffer from numerical inaccuracy due to [[Runge's phenomenon]]. One solution to this problem is [[Clenshaw\u2013Curtis quadrature]], in which the integrand is approximated by expanding it in terms of [[Chebyshev polynomials]]. This produces an approximation whose values never deviate far from those of the original function.\n\n[[Romberg's method]] builds on the trapezoid method to great effect. First, the step lengths are halved incrementally, giving trapezoid approximations denoted by {{math|''T''(''h''<sub>0</sub>), ''T''(''h''<sub>1</sub>)}}, and so on, where {{math|''h''<sub>''k''+1</sub>}} is half of {{math|''h''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. For each new step size, only half the new function values need to be computed; the others carry over from the previous size (as shown in the table above). But the really powerful idea is to [[Interpolation|interpolate]] a polynomial through the approximations, and extrapolate to {{math|''T''(0)}}. With this method a numerically ''exact'' answer here requires only four pieces (five function values). The [[Lagrange polynomial]] interpolating {{math|{''h''<sub>''k''</sub>,''T''(''h''<sub>''k''</sub>)}<sub>''k'' {{=}} 0...2</sub> {{=}}}} {(4.00,6.128), (2.00,4.352), (1.00,3.908)} is 3.76 + 0.148{{math|''h''<sup>2</sup>}}, producing the extrapolated value 3.76 at {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\n[[Gaussian quadrature]] often requires noticeably less work for superior accuracy. In this example, it can compute the function values at just two {{mvar|x}} positions, {{math|\u00b12 \u2044 {{sqrt|3}}}}, then double each value and sum to get the numerically exact answer. The explanation for this dramatic success lies in the choice of points. Unlike Newton\u2013Cotes rules, which interpolate the integrand at evenly spaced points, Gaussian quadrature evaluates the function at the roots of a set of [[orthogonal polynomials]]. An {{mvar|n}}-point Gaussian method is exact for polynomials of degree up to {{math|2''n'' \u2212 1}}. The function in this example is a degree 3 polynomial, plus a term that cancels because the chosen endpoints are symmetric around zero. (Cancellation also benefits the Romberg method.)\n\nIn practice, each method must use extra evaluations to ensure an error bound on an unknown function; this tends to offset some of the advantage of the pure Gaussian method, and motivates the popular [[Gauss\u2013Kronrod quadrature formula]]e. More broadly, [[adaptive quadrature]] partitions a range into pieces based on function properties, so that data points are concentrated where they are needed most.\n\nThe computation of higher-dimensional integrals (for example, volume calculations) makes important use of such alternatives as [[Monte Carlo integration]].\n\nA calculus text is no substitute for numerical analysis, but the reverse is also true. Even the best adaptive numerical code sometimes requires a user to help with the more demanding integrals. For example, improper integrals may require a change of variable or methods that can avoid infinite function values, and known properties like symmetry and periodicity may provide critical leverage. For example, the integral <math>\\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} e^{-x}\\,dx</math> is difficult to evaluate numerically because it is infinite at {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}. However, the substitution {{math|1=''u'' = {{radic|''x''}}}} transforms the integral into <math>2\\int_0^1 e^{-u^2}\\,du</math>, which has no singularities at all.\n\n===Mechanical===\nThe area of an arbitrary two-dimensional shape can be determined using a measuring instrument called [[planimeter]]. The volume of irregular objects can be measured with precision by the fluid [[displacement (fluid)|displaced]] as the object is submerged.\n\n===Geometrical===\n{{main|Quadrature (mathematics)}}\nArea can sometimes be found via [[geometrical]] [[compass-and-straightedge construction]]s of an equivalent [[square]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Integral equation]]\n* [[Integral symbol]]\n* [[Multiplicative calculus#History|Non-Newtonian calculus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{Citation | last=Apostol | first=Tom M. | author-link=Tom M.

Because sIBM affects different people in different ways and at different rates, there is no \"textbook case.\"\n\nEventually, sIBM results in general, progressive muscle weakness. The [[quadriceps]] and forearm muscles are usually affected early on. Common early symptoms include frequent tripping and falling, weakness going up stairs and trouble manipulating the fingers (including difficulty with tasks such as turning doorknobs or gripping keys). [[Foot drop]] in one or both feet has been a symptom of IBM and advanced stages of [[polymyositis]] (PM).\n\nDuring the course of the illness, the patient's mobility is progressively restricted as it becomes hard for him or her to bend down, reach for things, walk quickly and so on. Many patients say they have balance problems and fall easily, as the muscles cannot compensate for an off-balanced posture. Because sIBM makes the leg muscles weak and unstable, patients are very vulnerable to serious injury from tripping or falling down. Although pain has not been traditionally part of the \"textbook\" description, many patients report severe muscle pain, especially in the thighs.\n\nWhen present, [[dysphagia|difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)]] is a progressive condition in those with inclusion body myositis and often leads to death from [[aspiration pneumonia]]. Dysphagia is present in 40 to 85% of IBM cases.<ref name=\"pmid18936555\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Oh TH, Brumfield KA, Hoskin TL, Kasperbauer JL, Basford JR |title=Dysphagia in inclusion body myositis: clinical features, management, and clinical outcome |journal=Am J Phys Med Rehabil |volume=87 |issue=11 |pages=883\u20139 |year=2008 |pmid=18936555 |doi=10.1097/PHM.0b013e31818a50e2 }}</ref>\n\nIBM can also result in diminished capacity for aerobic exercise. This decline is most likely a consequence of the sedentary lifestyle that is often associated with the symptoms of IBM (i.e. progressive muscle weakness, decreased mobility, and increased level of fatigue). Therefore, one focus of treatment should be the improvement of aerobic capacity.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Johnson LG, Collier KE, Edwards DJ, etal |title=Improvement in aerobic capacity after an exercise program in sporadic inclusion body myositis |journal=J Clin Neuromuscul Dis |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=178\u201384 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19494728 |doi=10.1097/CND.0b013e3181a23c86 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1522-0443&volume=10&issue=4&spage=178}}</ref>\n\nPatients with sIBM usually eventually need to resort to a cane or a walker and in most cases, a wheelchair eventually becomes a necessity.\n\n\"The progressive course of s-IBM leads slowly to severe disability. Finger functions can become very impaired, such as for manipulating pens, keys, buttons, and zippers, pulling handles, and firmly grasping handshakes. Arising from a chair becomes difficult. Walking becomes more precarious. Sudden falls, sometimes resulting in major injury to the skull or other bones, can occur, even from walking on minimally-irregular ground or from other minor imbalances outside or in the home, due to weakness of quadriceps and gluteus muscles depriving the patient of automatic posture maintenance. A foot-drop can increase the likelihood of tripping. [[Dysphagia]] can occur, usually caused by upper esophageal constriction that often can be symptomatically improved, for several months to years, by bougie dilation per a GI or ENT physician. Respiratory muscle weakness can sometimes eventuate.\"<ref name=\"pmid16432144\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Askanas V, Engel WK |title=Inclusion-body myositis: a myodegenerative conformational disorder associated with Abeta, protein misfolding, and proteasome inhibition |journal=Neurology |volume=66 |issue=2 Suppl 1 | pages = S39\u2013S48 |year=2006 |pmid=16432144 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000192128.13875.1e}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nThe cause of IBM is unknown.

One hypothesis suggests that the inflammation-immune reaction, caused by an unknown trigger&nbsp;\u2013 likely an undiscovered virus or an autoimmune disorder\u2013 is the primary cause of sIBM and that the degeneration of muscle fibers and protein abnormalities are secondary features.<ref name=\"pmid16932602\">{{cite journal |author=Dalakas MC |title=Sporadic inclusion body myositis--diagnosis, pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies |journal=Nat Clin Pract Neurol |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=437\u2013447 |year=2006 |pmid=16932602 |doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0261}}</ref> Despite the arguments \"in favor of an adaptive immune response in sIBM, a purely autoimmune hypothesis for sIBM is untenable because of the disease's resistance to most immunotherapy.\"<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1172746|Inclusion Body Myositis}}</ref>\n\nThe second school of thought advocates the theory that sIBM is a degenerative disorder related to aging of the muscle fibers and that abnormal, potentially pathogenic protein accumulations in myofibrils play a key causative role in sIBM (apparently before the immune system comes into play). This hypothesis emphasizes the abnormal intracellular accumulation of many proteins, protein aggregation and misfolding, [[proteosome]] inhibition, and [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) stress.<ref name=\"pmid16432144\"/>\n\nOne review discusses the \"limitations in the beta-amyloid-mediated theory of IBM myofiber injury.\"<ref name=\"pmid19080758\">{{cite journal |author=Greenberg SA. |title=Inclusion body myositis: review of recent literature |journal=Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=83\u201389 |year=2009 |pmid=19080758 |doi=10.1007/s11910-009-0013-x }}</ref>\n\nDalakas (2006) suggested that a chain of events causes IBM\u2014some sort of virus, likely a [[retrovirus]], triggers the cloning of [[T cells]]. These T cells appear to be driven by specific [[antigen]]s to invade muscle fibers. In people with sIBM, the muscle cells display \u201cflags\u201d telling the immune system that they are infected or damaged (the muscles ubiquitously express MHC class I antigens) and this immune process leads to the death of muscle cells. The chronic stimulation of these antigens also causes stress inside the muscle cell in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) and this ER stress may be enough to cause a self-sustaining T cell response (even after a virus has dissipated). In addition, this ER stress may cause the misfolding of protein. The ER is in charge of processing and folding molecules carrying antigens. In IBM, muscle fibers are overloaded with these [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) molecules that carry the antigen protein pieces, leading to more ER stress and more protein misfolding.<ref name=\"pmid16932602\"/>\n\nA self-sustaining T cell response would make sIBM a type of autoimmune disorder. When studied carefully, it has not been impossible to detect an ongoing viral infection in the muscles. One theory is that a chronic viral infection might be the initial triggering factor setting IBM in motion. There have been a handful of IBM cases\u2014approximately 15\u2014that have shown clear evidence of a virus called [[HTLV-1]]. The HTLV-1 virus can cause [[leukemia]], but in most cases lies dormant and most people end up being lifelong carriers of the virus. One review says that the best evidence points towards a connection with some type of retrovirus and that a retroviral infection combined with immune recognition of the retrovirus is enough to trigger the inflammation process.<ref name=\"pmid16932602\"/>\n\n* [[amyloid]] protein\n* The hypothesis that [[beta amyloid]] protein is key to IBM has been supported in a mouse model using an A\u03b2 vaccine that was found to be effective against inclusion body myositis in mouse models.

Since these forms do not show features of muscle inflammation, they are classified as myopathies rather than forms of myositis. Because they do not display inflammation as a primary symptom, they may in fact be similar, but different diseases to sporadic inclusion body myositis. There are several different types, each inherited in different ways. See [[hereditary inclusion body myopathy]].\n\nA 2007 review concluded there is no indication that the genes responsible for the familial or hereditary conditions are involved in sIBM.<ref name=\"pmid17366591\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Needham M, Mastaglia FL, Garlepp MJ |title=Genetics of inclusion-body myositis |journal=Muscle Nerve |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=549\u2013561 |year=2007 |pmid=17366591 |doi=10.1002/mus.20766}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nElevated [[creatine kinase]] (CK) levels in the blood (at most ~10 times normal) are typical in sIBM but affected individuals can also present with normal CK levels.

Antibodies to cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase (cN1A; NT5C1A) have been strongly associated with the condition. In the clinical context of a classic history and positive antibodies, a muscle biopsy might be unnecessary.\n\n===Differential diagnosis===\nIBM is often initially misdiagnosed as [[polymyositis]]. A course of [[prednisone]] is typically completed with no improvement and eventually sIBM is confirmed. sIBM weakness comes on over months or years and progresses steadily, whereas polymyositis has an onset of weeks or months. Other forms of muscular dystrophy (e.g. limb girdle) must be considered as well.\n\n===Classification===\n* The common type is sIBM; it strikes individuals apparently at random.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Karpati G, O'Ferrall EK | date = Jan 2009 | title = Sporadic inclusion body myositis: Pathogenic considerations| url = | journal = Ann Neurol | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 7\u201311 | doi=10.1002/ana.21622| pmid = 19194875 }}</ref>\n* There is a type that has been observed in multiple siblings in the same generation in several families, termed ''familial inflammatory sIBM'', but it is not passed on from generation to generation.<ref name=\"pmid16932602\" />\n* There are also several very rare forms of ''hereditary inclusion body myopathy'' (hIBM) that are linked to specific genetic defects and that are passed on from generation to generation, each inherited in different ways.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Broccolini A. |author2=Mirabella M. | year = 2014 | title = Hereditary inclusion-body myopathies | url = | journal = Biochim.

Management is symptomatic. Prevention of falls is an important consideration. [[Exercise therapy for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies|Specialized exercise therapy]] may supplement treatment to enhance quality of life. Physical therapy is recommended to teach the patient a home exercise program, to teach how to compensate during mobility-gait training with an assistive device, transfers and bed mobility.\n\n==Other related disorders==\nWhen sIBM was originally described, the major feature noted was muscle inflammation. Two other disorders were also known to display muscle inflammation, and sIBM was classified along with them. They are [[dermatomyositis]] (DM) and [[polymyositis]] (PM) and all three illnesses were called [[idiopathic]] (of unknown origin) myositis or inflammatory myopathies.\n\nIt appears that sIBM and polymyositis share some features, especially the initial sequence of immune system activation, however, polmyositis comes on over weeks or months, does not display the subsequent muscle degeneration and protein abnormalities as seen in IBM, and as well, polymyositis tends to respond well to treatments, IBM does not. IBM is often confused with (misdiagnosed as) polymyositis. Polymyositis that does not respond to treatment is likely IBM.<ref>[http://www.myositis.org/your-myositis-community/live-discussions/406-when-myositis-doesnt-respond-to-treatment When myositis doesn't respond to treatment] Retrieved 20 April 2015.</ref>\n\n[[Dermatomyositis]] shares a number of similar physical symptoms and histopathological traits as polymyositis, but exhibits a skin rash not seen in polymyositis or sIBM. It may have different root causes unrelated to either polymyositis or sIBM.\n\nMutations in [[valosin-containing protein]] (VCP) cause multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), which can present (among others) as a rare form of inclusion body myopathy.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = 30691 \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|M|60|8}}<ref name=\"urlOrphanet: Sporadic inclusion body myositis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Lng=EN&Expert=611 |title=Orphanet: Sporadic inclusion body myositis |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref> \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|359.71}} \n|  ICDO           =  \n|  OMIM           = 147421 \n|  MedlinePlus    =  \n|  eMedicineSubj  = neuro \n|  eMedicineTopic = 422 \n|  MeshID         = D018979 \n|  GeneReviewsNBK  = NBK1262 \n|  GeneReviewsName = Inclusion Body Myopathy 2\n}}\n\n*[http://www.ibmmyositis.com/ Information and links to resources] by Bill Tillier\n*[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1262/ GeneReview/NIH/UW entry on Inclusion Body Myopathy 2]\n*[http://www.myositis.org/learn-about-myositis Learn about Myositis from The Myositis Association]\n*[http://aanem.org/Education/Patient-Resources.aspx%5D%5Bhttp://aanem.org/Education/Patient-Resources.aspx  American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine Patient Resources ]\n{{Systemic connective tissue disorders}}\n{{Myopathy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Inclusion Body Myositis}}\n[[Category:Systemic connective tissue disorders]]\n[[Category:Muscular disorders]]\n[[Category:Inflammations]]", "sha1": "2unbbgiga9fsq2ntwezqdufgmdapg62"}}, {"title": "Ion implantation", "ns": "0", "id": "15539", "revision": {"id": "865338613", "parentid": "860481731", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T09:13:50Z", "contributor": {"username": "Robbyb97", "id": "34960180"}, "minor": "", "comment": "just some minor grammar fixes", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n[[Image:Ion implantation machine at LAAS 0521.jpg|thumb|250px|An ion implantation system at [[Laboratory for analysis and architecture of systems|LAAS]] technological facility in Toulouse, France.]]\n'''Ion implantation''' is a low-temperature process by which [[ion (physics)|ion]]s of one element are accelerated into a solid target, thereby changing the physical, chemical, or electrical properties of the target. Ion implantation is used in [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor device fabrication]] and in metal finishing, as well as in [[materials science]] research. The ions can alter the elemental composition of the target (if the ions differ in composition from the target) if they stop and remain in the target.  Ion implantation also causes chemical and physical changes when the ions impinge on the target at high energy. The [[crystal structure]] of the target can be damaged or even destroyed by the energetic [[collision cascade]]s, and ions of sufficiently high energy (10s of MeV) can cause [[nuclear transmutation]].\n\n== General principle ==\n[[Image:ion implanter schematic.png|thumb|Ion implantation setup with mass separator]]\nIon implantation equipment typically consists of an [[ion source]], where ions of the desired element are produced, an [[particle accelerator|accelerator]], where the ions are electrostatically accelerated to a high energy, and a target chamber, where the ions impinge on a target, which is the material to be implanted. Thus ion implantation is a special case of [[particle radiation]]. Each ion is typically a single atom or molecule, and thus the actual amount of material implanted in the target is the integral over time of the ion current. This amount is called the dose. The currents supplied by implants are typically small (micro-amperes), and thus the dose which can be implanted in a reasonable amount of time is small. Therefore, ion implantation finds application in cases where the amount of chemical change required is small.\n\nTypical ion energies are in the range of 10 to 500 [[electronvolt|keV]] (1,600 to 80,000 aJ). Energies in the range 1 to 10 keV (160 to 1,600 aJ) can be used, but result in a penetration of only a few nanometers or less. Energies lower than this result in very little damage to the target, and fall under the designation [[ion beam deposition]]. Higher energies can also be used: accelerators capable of 5 MeV (800,000 aJ) are common. However, there is often great structural damage to the target, and because the depth distribution is broad ([[Bragg peak]]), the net composition change at any point in the target will be small.\n\nThe energy of the ions, as well as the ion species and the composition of the target determine the depth of penetration of the ions in the solid: A monoenergetic ion beam will generally have a broad depth distribution. The average penetration depth is called the range of the ions. Under typical circumstances ion ranges will be between 10 nanometers and 1 micrometer. Thus, ion implantation is especially useful in cases where the chemical or structural change is desired to be near the surface of the target. Ions gradually lose their energy as they travel through the solid, both from occasional collisions with target atoms (which cause abrupt energy transfers) and from a mild drag from overlap of electron orbitals, which is a continuous process. The loss of ion energy in the target is called [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|stopping]] and can be simulated with the [[binary collision approximation]] method.\n\nAccelerator systems for ion implantation are generally classified into medium current (ion beam currents between 10 \u03bcA and ~2 mA), high current (ion beam currents up to ~30 mA), high energy (ion energies above 200 keV and up to 10 MeV), and very high dose (efficient implant of dose greater than 10<sup>16 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2</sup>).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nAll varieties of ion implantation beamline designs contain certain general groups of functional components (see image). The first major segment of an ion beamline includes a device known as an ion source to generate the ion species. The source is closely coupled to biased electrodes for extraction of the ions into the beamline and most often to some means of selecting a particular ion species for transport into the main accelerator section. The \"mass\" selection is often accompanied by passage of the extracted ion beam through a magnetic field region with an exit path restricted by blocking apertures, or \"slits\", that allow only ions with a specific value of the product of mass and velocity/charge to continue down the beamline. If the target surface is larger than the ion beam diameter and a uniform distribution of implanted dose is desired over the target surface, then some combination of beam scanning and wafer motion is used. Finally, the implanted surface is coupled with some method for collecting the accumulated charge of the implanted ions so that the delivered dose can be measured in a continuous fashion and the implant process stopped at the desired dose level.<ref>{{cite book | first1=Robert W. | last1=Hamm | first2=Marianne E. | last2=Hamm | title=Industrial Accelerators and Their Applications | publisher=World Scientific | year=2012 | isbn=978-981-4307-04-8}}</ref>\n\n==Application in semiconductor device fabrication==\n===Doping===\n[[Doping (semiconductor)|Semiconductor doping]] with boron, phosphorus, or arsenic is a common application of ion implantation. When implanted in a semiconductor, each dopant atom can create a charge carrier in the semiconductor after [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. A [[Electron hole|hole]] can be created for a [[P-type semiconductor|p-type]] dopant, and an electron for an [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]] dopant. This modifies the conductivity of the semiconductor in its vicinity.  The technique is used, for example, for adjusting the threshold of a [[MOSFET]].\n\nIon implantation was developed as a method of producing the p-n junction of photovoltaic devices in the late 1970s and early 1980s,<ref>A. J. Armini, S. N. Bunker and M. B. Spitzer, \"Non-mass-analyzed Ion Implantation Equipment for high Volume Solar Cell Production,\" ''Proc. 16th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference'', 27-30 Sep 1982, San Diego California, pp. 895-899.</ref> along with the use of pulsed-electron beam for rapid annealing,<ref>G. Landis et al., \"Apparatus and Technique for Pulsed Electron Beam Annealing for Solar Cell Production,\" ''Proc. 15th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conf.,'' Orlando FL; 976-980 (1981).</ref> although it has not to date been used for commercial production.\n\n===Silicon on insulator===\nOne prominent method for preparing silicon on insulator (SOI) substrates from conventional [[silicon]] substrates is the ''SIMOX'' (separation by implantation of oxygen) process, wherein a buried high dose oxygen implant is converted to silicon oxide by a high temperature [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] process.\n\n===Mesotaxy===\nMesotaxy is the term for the growth of a crystallographically matching phase underneath the surface of the host crystal (compare to [[epitaxy]], which is the growth of the matching phase on the surface of a substrate). In this process, ions are implanted at a high enough energy and dose into a material to create a layer of a second phase, and the temperature is controlled so that the crystal structure of the target is not destroyed. The crystal orientation of the layer can be engineered to match that of the target, even though the exact crystal structure and lattice constant may be very different. For example, after the implantation of nickel ions into a silicon wafer, a layer of nickel silicide can be grown in which the crystal orientation of the silicide matches that of the silicon.\n\n==Application in metal finishing==\n===Tool steel toughening===\nNitrogen or other ions can be implanted into a tool steel target (drill bits, for example). The structural change caused by the implantation produces a surface compression in the steel, which prevents crack propagation and thus makes the material more resistant to fracture. The chemical change can also make the tool more resistant to corrosion.\n\n===Surface finishing===\nIn some applications, for example prosthetic devices such as artificial joints, it is desired to have surfaces very resistant to both chemical corrosion and wear due to friction. Ion implantation is used in such cases to engineer the surfaces of such devices for more reliable performance. As in the case of tool steels, the surface modification caused by ion implantation includes both a surface compression which prevents crack propagation and an alloying of the surface to make it more chemically resistant to corrosion.\n\n==Other applications==\n===Ion beam mixing===\nIon implantation can be used to achieve [[ion beam mixing]], i.e. mixing up atoms of different elements at an interface. This may be useful for achieving graded interfaces or strengthening adhesion between layers of immiscible materials.\n\n===Ion implantation-induced [[nanoparticle]] formation===\nIon implantation may be used to induce nano-dimensional particles in oxides such as [[sapphire]] and [[silica]]. The particles may be formed as a result of precipitation of the ion implanted species, they may be formed as a result of the production of an mixed oxide species that contains both the ion-implanted element and the oxide substrate, and they may be formed as a result of a reduction of the substrate, first reported by Hunt and Hampikian.<ref name=\"Hunt\">{{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=Eden|last2=Hampikian|first2=Janet|title=Ion implantation-induced nanoscale particle formation in Al2O3 and SiO2 via reduction|journal=Acta Materialia|date=1999|volume=47|issue=5|pages=1497\u20131511|doi=10.1016/S1359-6454(99)00028-2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645499000282|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Hunt2\">{{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=Eden|last2=Hampikian|first2=Janet|title=Implantation parameters affecting aluminum nano-particle formation in alumina|journal=Journal of Materials Science|date=April 2001|volume=36|issue=8|pages=1963\u20131973|doi=10.1023/A:1017562311310|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1017562311310|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hunt|first1=Eden|last2=Hampikian|first2=Janet|title=Method for ion implantation induced embedded particle formation via reduction|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6294223.PN.&OS=PN/6294223&RS=PN/6294223|website=uspto.gov|publisher=USPTO|accessdate=4 August 2017}}</ref> Typical ion beam energies used to produce nanoparticles range from 50 to 150 keV, with ion fluences that range from 10<sup>16</sup> to 10<sup>18</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=\"Werner\">{{cite journal|last1=Werner|first1=Z.|last2=Pisarek|first2=M.|last3=Barlak|first3=M.|last4=Ratajczak|first4=R.|last5=Starosta|first5=W.|last6=Piekoszewski|first6=J.|last7=Szymczyk|first7=W.|last8=Grotzschel|first8=R.|title=Chemical effects in Zr- and Co-implanted sapphire|journal=Vacuum|date=2009|volume=83|pages=S57-S60|doi=10.1016/j.vacuum.2009.01.022|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042207X09000487|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Alves\">{{cite journal|last1=Alves|first1=E.|last2=Marques|first2=C.|last3=da Silva|first3=R.C.|last4=Monteiro|first4=T.|last5=Soares|first5=J.|last6=McHargue|first6=C.|last7=Ononye|first7=L.C.|last8=Allard|first8=L.F|title=Structural and optical studies of Co and Ti implanted sapphire|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms|date=2003|volume=207|issue=1|pages=55\u201362|doi=10.1016/S0168-583X(03)00522-6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X03005226|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Xiang\">{{cite journal|last1=Xiang|first1=X.|last2=Zu|first2=X.

Vacancies are crystal lattice points unoccupied by an atom: in this case the ion collides with a target atom, resulting in transfer of a significant amount of energy to the target atom such that it leaves its crystal site. This target atom then itself becomes a projectile in the solid, and can cause [[collision cascade|successive collision events]].\nInterstitials result when such atoms (or the original ion itself) come to rest in the solid, but find no vacant space in the lattice to reside. These point defects can migrate and cluster with each other, resulting in [[dislocation]] loops and other defects.\n\n===Damage recovery===\nBecause ion implantation causes damage to the crystal structure of the target which is often unwanted, ion implantation processing is often followed by a thermal annealing. This can be referred to as damage recovery.\n\n===Amorphization===\nThe amount of crystallographic damage can be enough to completely amorphize the surface of the target: i.e. it can become an [[amorphous solid]] (such a solid produced from a melt is called a [[glass]]). In some cases, complete amorphization of a target is preferable to a highly defective crystal: An amorphized film can be regrown at a lower temperature than required to anneal a highly damaged crystal. Amorphisation of the substrate can occur as a result of the beam damage. For example, yttrium ion implantation into sapphire at an ion beam energy of 150 keV to a fluence of 5*10<sup>16</sup> Y<sup>+</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> produces an amorphous glassy layer approximately 110 nm in thickness, measured from the outer surface. [Hunt, 1999]\n\n===Sputtering===\nSome of the collision events result in atoms being ejected ([[sputtering|sputtered]]) from the surface, and thus ion implantation will slowly etch away a surface. The effect is only appreciable for very large doses.\n\n===Ion channelling===\n[[Image:Diamond structure.png|thumb|right|300 px|A diamond cubic crystal viewed from the [[Crystallography#Notation|<110>]] direction, showing hexagonal ion channels.]]\n\nIf there is a crystallographic structure to the target, and especially in semiconductor substrates where the crystal structure is more open, particular crystallographic directions offer much lower stopping than other directions. The result is that the range of an ion can be much longer if the ion travels exactly along a particular direction, for example the <110> direction in [[silicon]] and other [[diamond cubic]] materials.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/162575935|title=Materials science of thin films : deposition and structure|last=1936-|first=Ohring, Milton,|date=2002|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780125249751|edition=2nd|location=San Diego, CA|oclc=162575935}}</ref> This effect is called ''ion channelling'', and, like all the [[Channelling (physics)|channelling]] effects, is highly nonlinear, with small variations from perfect orientation resulting in extreme differences in implantation depth.  For this reason, most implantation is carried out a few degrees off-axis, where tiny alignment errors will have more predictable effects.\n\nIon channelling can be used directly in [[Rutherford backscattering]] and related techniques as an analytical method to determine the amount and depth profile of damage in crystalline thin film materials.\n\n== Safety ==\n\n=== Hazardous materials ===\nIn fabricating [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]], [[toxic]] materials such as [[arsine]] and [[phosphine]] are often used in the ion implanter process. Other common [[carcinogen]]ic, [[Corrosion|corrosive]], [[flammable]], or [[Toxicity|toxic]] elements include [[antimony]], [[arsenic]], [[phosphorus]], and [[boron]]. [[Semiconductor fabrication]] facilities are highly automated, but residue of hazardous elements in machines can be encountered during servicing and in [[vacuum pump]] hardware.\n\n=== High voltages and particle accelerators ===\nHigh voltage power supplies used in ion accelerators necessary for ion implantation can pose a risk of [[electrocution]].  In addition, high-energy atomic collisions can generate [[X-ray]]s and, in some cases, other ionizing radiation and [[radionuclide]]s. In addition to high voltage, [[particle accelerator]]s such as radio frequency [[linear particle accelerator]]s and laser [[Plasma acceleration|wakefield plasma accelerator]]s other hazards.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Ion implantation}}\n\n{{Glass science}}\n\n[[Category:Materials science]]\n[[Category:Semiconductor device fabrication]]\n[[Category:Semiconductor technology]]\n[[Category:Glass coating and surface modification]]", "sha1": "cn6viw9yb0bxwylgx0n0ve5ury9l8um"}}, {"title": "JohnnyCash", "ns": "0", "id": "15544", "redirect": {"title": "Johnny Cash"}, "revision": {"id": "783865865", "parentid": "705573091", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T04:25:09Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Johnny Cash]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from CamelCase}}\n}}", "sha1": "qmiyexp1c6f6d0el6tb5x0kcetjgftb"}}, {"title": "JohannSebastianBach", "ns": "0", "id": "15546", "redirect": {"title": "Johann Sebastian Bach"}, "revision": {"id": "528295786", "parentid": "15913013", "timestamp": "2012-12-16T12:00:55Z", "contributor": {"username": "MZMcBride", "id": "212624"}, "comment": "[[bugzilla:42616]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]", "sha1": "szl7tsoml92l295tx8km19c3h9yjbdl"}}, {"title": "JohnAbbott", "ns": "0", "id": "15548", "redirect": {"title": "John Abbott"}, "revision": {"id": "563209560", "parentid": "303533301", "timestamp": "2013-07-07T07:09:09Z", "contributor": {"username": "Graham87", "id": "194203"}, "minor": "", "comment": "1 revision: iport old edit from the Nostalgia Wikipedia, see [[User:Graham87/Import]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[John Abbott]]", "sha1": "gqpo8vk04d9ghdwsmjlkttfamv568yx"}}, {"title": "JulianSimon", "ns": "0", "id": "15549", "redirect": {"title": "Juli\u00e1n Sim\u00f3n"}, "revision": {"id": "63477891", "parentid": "15913015", "timestamp": "2006-07-12T20:55:27Z", "contributor": {"username": "ShakespeareFan00", "id": "1063872"}, "comment": "Redirecting to [[Juli\u00e1n Sim\u00f3n]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Juli\u00e1n Sim\u00f3n]]", "sha1": "ijll6rh56ksdi8a4ncmiwja5wbcfise"}}, {"title": "JapaN", "ns": "0", "id": "15554", "redirect": {"title": "Japan"}, "revision": {"id": "783865896", "parentid": "91937684", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T04:25:24Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Japan]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from CamelCase}}\n}}", "sha1": "qk2ewtp99hfegno48g0kfkjqrznwm94"}}, {"title": "JapanConstitution", "ns": "0", "id": "15555", "redirect": {"title": "Constitution of Japan"}, "revision": {"id": "290303930", "parentid": "290303921", "timestamp": "2009-05-16T12:51:30Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot", "id": "4928500"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contributions/72.82.217.164|72.82.217.164]] to version by Jeronimo.

Due to school age restrictions, his mother changed his birth date to 22 September 1948, which is what remains on his passport.

He later found a passion for movies influenced by the [[French New Wave]] especially [[Jean-Pierre Melville]]. Woo has said he was shy and had difficulty speaking, but found making movies a way to explore his feelings and thinking and would \"use movies as a language\".<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nThe local cinema would prove a haven of retreat. Woo found respite in [[musical film]]s, such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and in American [[Western (genre)|Westerns]].<ref>{{cite web|first1=amiamcable|title=John Woo|url=https://successfulpeeps.wordpress.com/2015/10/27/john-woo/|publisher=N/A}}</ref> He has stated the final scene of ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' made a particular impression on him in his youth: the device of two comrades, each of whom fire pistols from each hand, is a recurrent spectacle later found in his own work.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Hong Kong career==\n{{one source|section|date=December 2017}}\nIn 1969, Woo was hired as a script supervisor at [[Cathay Organisation|Cathay Studios]]. In 1971, he became an [[assistant director]] at [[Shaw Studios]]. His directorial debut in 1974 was the feature film ''The Young Dragons'' (\u9435\u6f22\u67d4\u60c5, ''Ti\u011b h\u00e0n r\u00f3u q\u00edng'').{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn the [[Kung fu]] [[action cinema|action]] genre, it was choreographed by [[Jackie Chan]] and featured dynamic camera-work and elaborate action scenes.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The film was picked up by [[Golden Harvest Studio]] where he went on to direct more martial arts films. He later had success as a comedy director with ''Money Crazy'' (\u767c\u9322\u5bd2, ''F\u0101 qi\u00e1n h\u00e0n'') (1977), starring Hong Kong comedian [[Ricky Hui]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Woo was experiencing [[occupational burnout]]. Several of his films were commercial disappointments, and he felt a distinct lack of creative control. It was during this period of self-imposed exile that director/producer [[Tsui Hark]] provided the funding for Woo to film a longtime pet project, ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'' (1986).\n\nThe story of two brothers\u2014one a law enforcement officer, the other a criminal\u2014the film was a financial [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]. ''A Better Tomorrow'' became a defining achievement in [[Hong Kong action cinema]]<ref>{{IMDb name|247|section=bio}}</ref> for its combination of emotional drama, slow-motion gunplay, and gritty atmospherics. Its signature visual device of two-handed, two-gunned shootouts within confined quarters\u2014often referred to as \"[[gun fu]]\" was novel, and its diametrical inversion of the \"good-guys-bad guys\" formula in its characterization would influence later American films.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nWoo would make several more [[Heroic bloodshed|Heroic Bloodshed]] films in the late 1980s and early 1990s, nearly all starring [[Chow Yun-Fat]]. These violent [[gangster]] [[Thriller film|thriller]]s typically focus on men bound by honor and loyalty, at odds with contemporary values of impermanence and expediency. The protagonists of these films, therefore, may be said to present a common lineage with the Chinese literary tradition of loyalty among generals depicted in classics such as \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nWoo gained international recognition with the release of ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]'', which became the most successful Hong Kong film in American release since [[Bruce Lee]]'s ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973) and garnered Woo an American [[cult film|cult]] following. ''[[Bullet in the Head]]'' followed a year later failed to find an audience that accepted its political undertones, and failed to recoup its massive budget.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nHis last Hong Kong film before emigrating to the United States was ''[[Hard Boiled]]'' (1992), a police thriller that served as the antithesis of his previous glorification of gangsters. Most notable of its numerous action scenes is a 30-minute climax set within a hospital. One particular [[long take]] follows two characters for exactly 2 minutes and 42 seconds as they fight their way between hospital floors.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} On the [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion]] DVD and laserdisc, this chapter is referenced as \"2 minutes, 42 seconds.\" The film was considerably darker than most of Woo's previous films, depicting a police force nearly helpless to stop the influx of gangsters in the city, and the senseless slaughter of innocents. As a result, it did not match the success of his other films.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n''John Woo: Interviews'' ({{ISBN|9781578067763}}) includes a new 36-page interview with Woo by editor [[Robert K. Elder]], which documents the years 1968 to 1990, from Woo's early career in working on comedies and kung fu films (in which he gave [[Jackie Chan]] in one of his first major film roles), to his gunpowder morality plays in Hong Kong.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==United States career==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2017}}\nAn \u00e9migr\u00e9 in 1993, the director experienced difficulty in cultural adjustment while contracted with [[Universal Studios]] to direct [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] in ''[[Hard Target]]''. As characteristics of other foreign national film directors confronted the Hollywood environment, Woo was unaccustomed to pervasive management concerns, such as limitations on violence and completion schedules. When initial cuts failed to yield an [[MPAA film rating system|\"R\" rated film]], the studio assumed control of the project and edited footage to produce a cut \"suitable for American audiences\". A \"rough cut\" of the film, supposedly the original unrated version, is still circulated among his admirers.\n\nA three-year hiatus saw Woo next direct [[John Travolta]] and [[Christian Slater]] in ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]].'' A frenetic chase-themed film, the director once again found himself hampered by studio management and editorial concerns. Despite a larger budget than his previous ''[[Hard Target]],'' the final feature lacked the trademark Woo style. Public reception saw modest financial success.\n\nReluctant to pursue projects which would necessarily entail front-office controls, the director cautiously rejected the script for ''[[Face/Off]]'' several times until it was rewritten to suit him. (The futuristic setting was changed to a contemporary one.) [[Paramount Pictures]] also offered the director significantly more freedom to exercise his speciality: emotional characterisation and elaborate action. A complex story of adversaries\u2014each of whom surgically alters their identity\u2014law enforcement agent [[John Travolta]] and terrorist [[Nicolas Cage]] play a cat-and-mouse game, trapped in each other's outward appearance. ''Face/Off'' opened in 1997 to critical acclaim and strong attendance. Grosses in the United States exceeded $100&nbsp;million. ''Face/Off'' was also nominated for an [[Academy Award]] in the category [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Sound Effects Editing]] ([[Mark Stoeckinger]]) at the [[70th Academy Awards]].\n\nIn 2003, Mr. Woo directed a television pilot entitled ''The Robinsons: Lost in Space'' for The WB Television Network, based on the 1960s television series ''[[Lost in Space]]''. The pilot was not purchased, although bootleg copies have been made available by fans.\n\nJohn Woo has made three additional films in Hollywood: ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]'', ''[[Windtalkers]]'' and ''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]''. ''Mission: Impossible 2'' was the highest-grossing film in America in 2000, but received mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2000&p=.htm|title=2000 Yearly Box Office Results|accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref> ''Windtalkers'' and ''Paycheck'' fared poorly at the box office and were summarily dismissed by critics. Woo directed and produced a videogame called ''[[Stranglehold (video game)|Stranglehold]]'' for games consoles and PC. It is a sequel to his 1992 film, ''[[Hard Boiled]]''. He also produced the 2007 [[anime]] movie, ''[[Appleseed: Ex Machina]]'', the sequel to [[Shinji Aramaki]]'s [[2004 in film|2004 film]] ''[[Appleseed (film)|Appleseed]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Return to Asian cinema==\nIn 2008, Woo returned to Asian cinema with the completion of the two-part [[epic film|epic]] [[war film]] ''[[Red Cliff (film)|Red Cliff]]'', based on a historical battle from ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]''. Produced on a grand scale, it is his first film in China since he emigrated from Hong Kong to the United States in 1993. Part 1 of the film was released throughout Asia in July, 2008, to generally favourable reviews and strong attendance. Part 2 was released in China in January, 2009.\n\nJohn Woo was presented with a [[Golden Lion]] award for lifetime achievement at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 2010.<ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jn8fqNXb3XIs_esDukLr47rR7IvgD9I0JDEO0 Woo awarded Golden Lion for lifetime achievement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907000509/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jn8fqNXb3XIs_esDukLr47rR7IvgD9I0JDEO0 |date=7 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nHe followed ''Red Cliff'' with another two-part film, ''[[The Crossing (2014 film)|The Crossing]]'', in 2014 and 2015.

Its production was due to begin by the end of 2008, with a theatrical release planned in December 2009. However, in early April 2009, the film was cancelled due to script right issues. Reports indicated that Woo might be working on another World War II film, this time about the [[American Volunteer Group]], or the [[Flying Tigers]]. The movie was tentatively titled \"Flying Tiger Heroes\" and Woo is reported as saying it will feature \"The most spectacular aerial battle scenes ever seen in Chinese cinema.\" It was not clear whether Woo would not be directing the earlier war film, or whether it was put on the back burner.

At the end of the seventh century, a delegation from Japan requested that ''Nihon'' be used as the name of their country. This name may have its origin in a letter sent in 607 and recorded in the [[Book of Sui|official history]] of the [[Sui dynasty]]. [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]], the Regent of Japan, sent a mission to China with a letter in which he called himself \"the Emperor of the Land where the Sun rises\" (\u65e5\u51fa\u8655\u5929\u5b50).

The term {{Nihongo|''Wa''|\u548c}} is a homophone of ''Wo'' \u502d (pronounced \"Wa\" by the Japanese), which has been used by the Chinese as a designation for the Japanese as early as the third century [[Three Kingdoms]] period.

It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (''[[fusuma]]'') were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, [[modern architecture|modern]], and [[post-modern architecture]] into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.\n\nThe introduction of [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] during the sixth century was a catalyst for large-scale [[Buddhist temples in Japan|temple]] building using complicated techniques in wood. Influence from the Chinese [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] dynasties led to the foundation of the first permanent capital in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. Its checkerboard street layout used the Chinese capital of [[Chang'an]] as a template for its design.

For example, maps and geography textbooks divide Japan into the eight regions, weather reports usually give the weather by region, and many businesses and institutions use their home region as part of their name ([[Kinki Nippon Railway]], Ch\u016bgoku Bank, [[Tohoku University]], etc.).

As Japan is situated in a volcanic zone along the Pacific deeps, frequent low-intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive earthquakes occur several times a century.

They are separated from the mainland by the [[Sea of Japan]], which historically served as a protective barrier. The country consists of four major islands: [[Hokkaido]], [[Honshu]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Kyushu]]; with more than 6,500 adjacent smaller islands and islets (\"island\" defined as land more than 100 m in circumference),<ref>{{cite web |title = \u5cf6\u3068\u306f\u4f55\u304b |url = http://www.nijinet.or.jp/info/faq/tabid/65/Default.aspx | publisher = Center for Research and Promotion of Japanese Islands | accessdate = 2015-10-11 }}</ref> including the [[Izu Islands]] and [[Ogasawara Islands]] in the [[Nanp\u014d Islands]], and the [[Satsunan Islands]], [[Okinawa Islands]], and [[Sakishima Islands]] of the [[Ryukyu Islands]].\n\nThe national territory also includes the [[Volcano Islands]] (Kazan Retto) such as [[Iwo Jima]], located some 1,200 kilometers south of mainland [[Tokyo]]. A territorial dispute with Russia, dating from the end of World War II, over the two southernmost of the [[Kuril Islands]], [[Iturup|Etorofu]] and [[Kunashir Island|Kunashiri]], and the smaller [[Shikotan]] Island and [[Habomai Islands]] northeast of [[Hokkaido]] remains a sensitive spot in [[Japanese\u2013Russian relations]] ({{As of|2005|lc=on}}). Excluding disputed territory, the archipelago covers about 378,000 square kilometers. No point in Japan is more than 150 kilometers from the sea.\n\nThe four major islands are separated by narrow straits and form a natural entity. The [[Ryukyu Islands]] curve 970 kilometers southward from [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]].\n\nThe distance between Japan and the [[Korean Peninsula]], the nearest point on the Asian continent, is about 200 kilometers at the [[Korea Strait]]. Japan has always been linked with the continent through trade routes, stretching in the north toward [[Siberia]], in the west through the [[Tsushima Island]]s to the Korean Peninsula, and in the south to the ports on the south China coast.\n\nThe Japanese islands are the summits of mountain ridges uplifted near the outer edge of the [[continental shelf]]. About 73 percent of Japan's area is mountainous, and scattered plains and intermontane basins (in which the population is concentrated) cover only about 27 percent. A long chain of mountains runs down the middle of the archipelago, dividing it into two halves, the \"face\", fronting on the Pacific Ocean, and the \"back\", toward the Sea of Japan. On the Pacific side are steep mountains 1,500 to 3,000 meters high, with deep valleys and gorges.\n\nCentral Japan is marked by the convergence of the three mountain chains\u2014the [[Hida Mountains|Hida]], [[Kiso Mountains|Kiso]], and [[Akaishi Mountains|Akaishi mountains]]\u2014that form the [[Japanese Alps]] (Nihon Arupusu), several of whose peaks are higher than 3,000 meters. The highest point in the Japanese Alps is [[Mount Kita]] at 3,193 meters. The highest point in the country is [[Mount Fuji]] (Fujisan, also erroneously called Fujiyama), a volcano dormant since 1707 that rises to {{convert|3776|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]. On the Sea of Japan side are plateaus and low mountain districts, with altitudes of 500 to 1,500 meters.\n\nThe populated plains or mountain basins are not extensive in area. The largest, the [[Kant\u014d Plain]], where [[Tokyo]] is situated, covers only 13,000 square kilometers. Other important plains are the [[N\u014dbi Plain]] surrounding [[Nagoya]], the [[Kinai Plain]] in the [[Osaka]]\u2013[[Kyoto]] area, the [[Sendai Plain]] around the city of [[Sendai]] in northeastern Honsh\u016b, and the [[Ishikari Plain]] on Hokkaid\u014d. Many of these plains are along the coast, and their areas have been increased by land reclamation throughout recorded history.\n\n===Rivers, lakes and coasts===\n[[File:Seto_Inland_Sea.jpg|thumb|[[Seto Inland Sea]]]]\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}\nRivers are generally steep and swift, and few are suitable for navigation except in their lower reaches. Although most rivers are less than 300 kilometers in length, their rapid flow from the mountains provides a valuable, renewable resource: [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] generation. Japan's hydroelectric power potential has been exploited almost to capacity. Seasonal variations in flow have led to extensive development of flood control measures. Most of the rivers are relatively short. The longest, the [[Shinano River]], which winds through [[Nagano Prefecture]] to [[Niigata Prefecture]] and flows into the Sea of Japan, is {{convert|367|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. The largest freshwater lake is [[Lake Biwa]] {{convert|671|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, northeast of [[Kyoto]].\n\nExtensive coastal shipping, especially around the [[Seto Inland Sea]] (Seto Naikai), compensates for the lack of navigable rivers. The Pacific coastline south of Tokyo is characterized by long, narrow, gradually shallowing inlets produced by sedimentation, which has created many natural harbors. The Pacific coastline north of Tokyo, the coast of Hokkaid\u014d, and the Sea of Japan coast are generally unindented, with few natural harbors.\n\nIn November 2008, Japan filed a request to expand its claimed [[continental shelf]].<ref name=\"Upi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2012/04/28/Japan-granted-more-continental-shelf/UPI-15731335656074/?spt=hs&or=tn|title=Japan granted more continental shelf|publisher =Upi.com|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> In April 2012, the U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf recognized around {{convert|310000|km2|sqmi}} of seabed around [[Okinotorishima]], giving Japan priority over access to seabed resources in nearby areas. According to U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, the approved expansion is equal to about 82% of Japan's total land area.<ref name=\"Upi\"/> The [[People's Republic of China]] and [[South Korea]] have opposed Japan's claim because they view Okinotorishima not as an island, but as a group of rocks.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Land Reclamation ===\n[[File:151229_Kobe_Port_Japan02bs.jpg|thumb|[[Kobe Airport]] in [[Osaka Bay]]]]\n\nThe [[Japanese archipelago]] is mainly rugged and mountainous (73%) so the relatively small amount of habitable land has prompted significant terrain modification by humans over many centuries. \n\nApproximately 0.5% of Japan\u2019s total area is reclaimed land (umetatechi). It began in the 12th century. Land was reclaimed from the sea and from river deltas by building [[Levee|dikes]] and drainage and rice paddies on terraces carved into mountainsides. The majority of [[land reclamation]] projects occurred after [[World War II]] during Japan's economic miracle with high economic growth. Reclamation of 80% to 90% of all the tidal flatland was done. Big land reclamation projects with [[landfill]] were done in coastal areas for maritime and industrial factories. Such as [[Higashi Ogishima]] in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Osaka Bay]] and [[Nagasaki Airport]]. [[Port Island]], [[Rokko Island]] and [[Kobe Airport]] were built in [[Kobe]]. Late 20th and early 21st century projects include [[artificial islands]] such as [[Chubu Centrair International Airport]] in [[Ise Bay]], [[Kansai International Airport]] in the middle of [[Osaka Bay]], [[Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise]] and [[Wakayama Marina City]].<ref name=\"reclaimed-land\">{{cite web |url=http://japanpropertycentral.com/real-estate-faq/reclaimed-land-in-japan/ |title=Reclaimed Land in Japan |publisher=Japan Property Central |date= |accessdate=2018-09-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226211747/http://japanpropertycentral.com/real-estate-faq/reclaimed-land-in-japan/ |archivedate=2018-02-26 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe village of [[\u014cgata, Akita|Ogata]] in [[Akita, Japan]], was established on land reclaimed from [[Lake Hachirogata]] (Japan's second largest lake at the time) starting in 1957.

However, its climate varies from cool [[humid continental climate]] (K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Dfb'') in the north such as northern Hokkaido, to warm [[tropical rainforest climate]] (K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Af'') in the south such as [[Ishigaki, Okinawa|Ishigaki]] in the [[Yaeyama Islands]].\n\n=== Climate zones ===\n\nJapan's varied geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones.\n\n* {{nihongo|[[Hokkaido]]|\u5317\u6d77\u9053|Hokkaid\u014d}}: Belonging to the [[humid continental climate]], Hokkaido has long, cold winters and cool summers. Precipitation is not great.\n* {{nihongo|[[Sea of Japan]]|\u65e5\u672c\u6d77|Nihonkai}}: The northwest seasonal wind in winter gives heavy snowfall, which south of [[Tohoku region|Tohoku]] mostly melts before the beginning of spring. In summer it is a little less rainy than the Pacific area but sometimes experiences extreme high temperatures due to the [[foehn wind]] phenomenon.\n* {{nihongo|[[Central Highland (Japan)|Central Highland]]|\u4e2d\u592e\u9ad8\u5730|Ch\u016b\u014d-k\u014dchi}}: A typical inland climate gives large temperature variations between summers and winters and between days and nights. Precipitation is lower than on the coast due to rain shadow effects.\n* {{nihongo|[[Seto Inland Sea]]|\u702c\u6238\u5185\u6d77|Setonaikai}}: The mountains in the Ch\u016bgoku and Shikoku regions block the seasonal winds and bring mild climate and many fine days throughout the year.\n* {{nihongo|[[Pacific Ocean]]|\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b|Taiheiy\u014d}}: The climate varies greatly between the north and the south but generally winters are significantly milder and sunnier than those of the side that faces the Sea of Japan. Summers are hot due to the southeast seasonal wind. Precipitation is very heavy in the south, and heavy in the summer in the north. The climate of the [[Ogasawara Islands|Ogasawara Island]] chain in the Pacific Ocean ranges from a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Cfa'') to [[tropical savanna climate]] (K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Aw'') with temperatures being warm to hot all year round.\n* {{nihongo|[[Ryukyu Islands]]|\u5357\u897f\u8af8\u5cf6|Nansei-shot\u014d}}: The climate of these islands ranges from humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Cfa'') in the north to tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Af'') in the south with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very high, and is especially affected by the rainy season and typhoons.\n\n=== Temperature and rainfall ===\n\nAs an [[island nation]], Japan has the 6th longest coastline in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title = The length of the coast for the countries of the world |url = http://world.bymap.org/Coastlines.html | accessdate = 2015-10-11 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://world.bymap.org/Coastlines.html|title=Coastline Lengths / Countries of the World|website=world.bymap.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-28}}</ref> A few prefectures are landlocked: [[Gunma Prefecture|Gunma]], [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]], [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]], [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]], [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]], [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]], and [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]]. As [[Mt. Fuji]] and the coastal [[Japanese Alps]] provide a rain shadow, Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures receive the least precipitation in Honshu, though it still exceeds {{convert|900|mm|in|0}} annually. A similar effect is found in Hokkaido, where [[Okhotsk Subprefecture]] receives as little as {{convert|750|mm|in|0}} per year. All other prefectures have coasts on the Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan, Seto Inland Sea or have a body of salt water connected to them. Two prefectures\u2014[[Hokkaido Prefecture|Hokkaido]] and [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]]\u2014are composed entirely of islands.\n\nJapan is generally a rainy country with high humidity. Because of its wide range of latitude, seasonal winds and different types of ocean currents, Japan has a variety of climates, with a latitude range of the inhabited islands from 24\u00b0 to 46\u00b0 north, which is comparable to the range between [[Nova Scotia]] and [[The Bahamas]] in the east coast of [[North America]]. [[Tokyo]] is at about 35 degrees north latitude, comparable to that of [[Tehran]], [[Athens]], or [[Las Vegas]].\n\nRegional climatic variations range from [[humid continental]] in the northern island of [[Hokkaido]] extending down through northern Japan to the [[Central Highland (Japan)|Central Highland]], then blending with and eventually changing to a [[humid subtropical climate]] on the Pacific Coast and ultimately reaching [[tropical rainforest climate]] on the Yaeyama Islands of the Ryukyu Islands. Climate also varies dramatically with altitude and with location on the Pacific Ocean or on the Sea of Japan.\n\nNorthern Japan has warm summers but long, cold winters with heavy snow. Central Japan in its elevated position, has hot summers and moderate to short winters with some areas having very heavy snow, and southwestern Japan has long hot summer and short mild winters. The generally temperate climate exhibits marked seasonal variation such as the blooming of the spring cherry blossoms, the calls of the summer cicada and fall foliage colors that are celebrated in [[Japanese art|art]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]].\n\nThe hottest temperature ever measured in Japan, {{convert|41.1|\u00b0C|lk=on}}, occurred in Kumagaya on 23 July 2018.<ref>[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201308120105 Kochi Prefecture sees highest temperature ever recorded in Japan - 41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813031959/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201308120105 |date=2013-08-13 }} - [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201308120105 Asahi Shimbun] </ref> and the coldest was {{convert|-41.0|\u00b0C|lk=on}} recorded at Asahikawa, Hokkaid\u014d on 25 January 1902.\n\n=== Summer ===\n\nThe climate from June to September is marked by hot, wet weather brought by tropical airflows from the Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia. These airflows are full of moisture and deposit substantial amounts of rain when they reach land. There is a marked rainy season, beginning in early June and continuing for about a month. It is followed by hot, sticky weather. Five or six [[Tropical cyclone|typhoon]]s pass over or near Japan every year from early August to early October, sometimes resulting in significant damage. Annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] averages between {{convert|1000|and|2500|mm|-1|abbr=on}} except for the areas such as [[Kii Peninsula]] and [[Yakushima Island]] which is Japan's wettest place<ref>{{cite web |title = Japan Climate Charts Index |url = http://www.climate-charts.com/Countries/Japan.html | accessdate = 2015-10-11 }}</ref> with the annual precipitation being one of the world's highest at 4,000 to 10,000&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web |title = Yakushima World Heritage property |url = http://www.env.go.jp/nature/isan/worldheritage/en/yakushima/area/index.html | publisher = Ministry of the Environment | accessdate = 2015-10-11 }}</ref>\n\nMaximum precipitation, like the rest of East Asia, occurs in the summer months except on the Sea of Japan coast where strong northerly winds produce a maximum in late autumn and early winter. Except for a few sheltered inland valleys during December and January, precipitation in Japan is above {{convert|25|mm|in|0}} of rainfall equivalent in all months of the year, and in the wettest coastal areas it is above {{convert|100|mm|in|0}} per month throughout the year.\n\nMid June to mid July is generally the [[East Asian rainy season|rainy season]] in Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu, excluding Hokkaid\u014d since the seasonal rain front or {{nihongo|''baiu zensen''|\u6885\u96e8\u524d\u7dda|}} dissipates in northern Honshu before reaching [[Hokkaido]]. In [[Okinawa]], the rainy season starts early in May and continues until mid June. Unlike the rainy season in mainland Japan, it rains neither everyday nor all day long during the rainy season in Okinawa. Between July and October, [[typhoon]]s, grown from tropical depressions generated near the equator, can attack Japan with furious rainstorms.\n\n=== Winter ===\n\nIn winter, the [[Siberian High]] develops over the Eurasian land mass and the [[Aleutian Low]] develops over the northern Pacific Ocean. The result is a flow of cold air southeastward across Japan that brings freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls to the central mountain ranges facing the Sea of Japan, but clear skies to areas fronting on the Pacific.\n\nThe warmest winter temperatures are found in the [[Nanp\u014d Islands|Nanp\u014d]] and [[Bonin Islands]], which enjoy a tropical climate due to the combination of latitude, distance from the Asian mainland, and warming effect of winds from the Kuroshio, as well as the Volcano Islands (at the latitude of the southernmost of the Ryukyu Islands, 24\u00b0 N). The coolest summer temperatures are found on the northeastern coast of Hokkaid\u014d in [[Kushiro Subprefecture|Kushiro]] and [[Nemuro Subprefecture]]s.\n\n=== Sunshine ===\n\nSunshine, in accordance with Japan\u2019s uniformly heavy rainfall, is generally modest in quantity, though no part of Japan receives the consistently gloomy fogs that envelope the [[Sichuan Basin]] or [[Taipei]]. Amounts range from about six hours per day in the Inland Sea coast and sheltered parts of the Pacific Coast and Kant\u014d Plain to four hours per day on the [[Sea of Japan]] coast of Hokkaid\u014d. In December there is a very pronounced sunshine gradient between the Sea of Japan and Pacific coasts, as the former side can receive less than 30 hours and the Pacific side as much as 180 hours. In summer, however, sunshine hours are lowest on exposed parts of the Pacific coast where fogs from the Oyashio current create persistent cloud cover similar to that found on the [[Kuril Islands]] and [[Sakhalin]].\n\n== Population Distribution ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Japan}}\n\n[[File:JapanCitiesTownsOMC.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|right|A map of Japan's major cities, main towns and selected smaller centers]]\n\nJapan has a [[Demography_of_Japan|population]] of 126,672,000 in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/GL08020101.do?_toGL08020101_&tstatCode=000001080615&requestSender=search|script-title=ja:\u6700\u65b0\u7d50\u679c\u4e00\u89a7\u3000\u653f\u5e9c\u7d71\u8a08\u306e\u7dcf\u5408\u7a93\u53e3\u3000GL08020101|publisher=Statistics Bureau of Japan|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref> It is the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|tenth most populous country]] and second most populous [[island country]] in the world. \n\nThe terrain of [[Japan]] is mostly rugged and mountainous with 66% forest.<ref name=\"worldbank\"/> This caused the [[Demography of Japan|population]] to be clustered in urban areas on the coast, plains and valleys.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u5730\u5f62\u5206\u985e |url=http://www.gsi.go.jp/atlas/archive/j-atlas-d_j_02.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Geospatial Information Authority of Japan |accessdate = 2015-10-14 }}</ref> In 2010, 90.7% of the total Japanese population lived in cities.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u5e73\u621022\u5e74\u56fd\u52e2\u8abf\u67fb\u6700\u7d42\u5831\u544a\u66f8 \u4eba\u53e3\u306e\u5730\u57df\u5206\u5e03 |url=http://www.stat.go.jp/data/kokusei/2010/final/pdf/01-02.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications Statistics Bureau |accessdate = 2015-10-14 }}</ref> Japan is an urban society with about only 5% of the [[labor force]] working in [[agriculture]].

It struck offshore about {{convert|371|km|mi}} northeast of Tokyo and {{convert|130|km|mi}} east of the city of [[Sendai]], and created a massive tsunami that devastated Japan's northeastern coastal areas. At least 100 aftershocks registering a 6.0 magnitude or higher have followed the main shock. At least 15,000 people died as a result.\n\nReclaimed land and man-made islands are particularly susceptible to liquefaction during an earthquake. As a result, there are specific earthquake resistance standards and ground reform work that applies to all construction in these areas. In an area that was possibly reclaimed in the past, old maps and land condition drawings are checked and drilling is carried out to determine the strength of the ground. However this can be very costly, so for a private residential block of land, a swedish weight sounding test is more common.<ref name=\"reclaimed-land\"/>\n\nJapan has become a world leader in research on causes and prediction of earthquakes. The development of advanced technology has permitted the construction of [[skyscraper]]s even in earthquake-prone areas. Extensive civil defence efforts focus on training in protection against earthquakes, in particular against accompanying fire, which represents the greatest danger.\n\n==== Volcanic eruptions ====\n{{see also|List of volcanoes in Japan}}\n\nJapan has 108 active [[volcano]]es.

High population density; 329.5 people per square kilometer for total area; 1,523 persons per square kilometer for habitable land. More than 50% of the population lives on 2% of the land. (July 1993). According to research in 2018, the population to land density ratio has gradually increased, now at 127 Million per 337 km2. Compared to the findings of July 1993 as well as in July 2000, the Population density has greatly increased, from 50% of the population living on 2% of the land to 77%. However, as the years have progressed since the last recordings of the population, Japan\u2019s population has decreased immensely, raising concern about the future of Japan. There are many causes, such as the declining birthrates, as well as the ratio of men to women since the last measurements from the years of 2006 and 2010. According to researchers, the birth rate is said to decrease immensely as the year's progress, with an estimation of the population dropping from its current state of [https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/07/health/japan-child-population-record-low-intl/index.html 126.26 million to 86.74 million by the year of 2060.]\n\n===Sex ratio===\n[[File:Shijo procession girls 197143581 d6ea13f0a2 o.jpg|thumb|Japanese women wearing [[kimono]]s]]\n(2006 est.)\n:at birth: 1.05 male(s)/female\n:under 15 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n:15\u201364 years: 1.01 male(s)/female\n:65 years and over: 0.73 male(s)/female\n:total population: 0.95 male(s)/female\n\n(2010 est.)\n:at birth: 1.056 male(s)/female\n:under 15 years: 1.06 male(s)/female\n:15-64 years: 1.02 male(s)/female\n:65 years and over: 0.74 male(s)/female\n:total population: 0.95 male(s)/female\n\n===HIV/AIDS===\n{{main article|HIV/AIDS in Japan}}\nAdult prevalence rate\n:less than 0.1% (2009 est.)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Global Health Care|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PS0C2EuedncC|publisher = Jones & Bartlett Publishers|date = 2012-05-30|isbn = 9780763799649|language = en|first = Carol|last = Holtz|page = 46}}</ref>\n\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS\n:12,000 (2003 est.)\n:9,600 (2007 est.)\n\nDeaths\n:500 (2003 est.)\n:fewer than 100 (2009 est.)<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n{{main article|Ethnic groups of Japan}}\n[[File:Shibuya Crossing, May 2017.jpg|thumb|Japanese people in [[Shibuya]], Tokyo]]\nNaturalized Japanese citizens and native-born Japanese nationals with multi-ethnic background are all considered to be Japanese in the population census of Japan,<ref name=\"xvq\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moj.go.jp/PRESS/090710-1/090710-1.html |title=\u5e73\u621020\u5e74\u672b\u73fe\u5728\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\u767b\u9332\u8005\u7d71\u8a08\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066(Number of Foreign residents in Japan) |publisher=Moj.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}</ref> therefore no ethnicity census data is available.\n\n===Marital status===\n{{main article|Marriage in Japan}}\n:Over 15: Never married Male 61.8%, Female 58.2%. \n:16\u201324: Never married Male 31.8%, Female 23.7%.\n:25\u201329: Never married Male 69.3%, Female 54.0%.\n:30\u201334: Never married Male 42.9%, Female 26.6% (July 2000).\n\n==Vital statistics==\nLive births, birth and death rates and overall fertility rate in Japan from 1899 to present.<ref>B.R.

About 50% of these moves were within the same prefecture; the others were relocations from one prefecture to another. During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by [[urbanization]] as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education. Out-migration from rural prefectures continued in the late 1980s, but more slowly than in previous decades.\n\nIn the 1980s, government policy provided support for new urban development away from the large cities, particularly Tokyo, and assisted regional cities to attract young people to live and work there. Regional cities offered familiarity to those from nearby areas, lower costs of living, shorter commutes, and, in general, a more relaxed lifestyle than could be had in larger cities. Young people continued to move to large cities, however, to attend universities and find work, but some returned to regional cities (a pattern known as U-turn) or to their prefecture of origin (a pattern referred to as \"J-turn\").\n\nGovernment statistics show that in the 1980s significant numbers of people left the largest central cities (Tokyo and Osaka) to move to suburbs within their metropolitan areas. In 1988 more than 500,000 people left Tokyo, which experienced a net loss through migration of nearly 73,000 for the year. Osaka had a net loss of nearly 36,000 in the same year.\n\nDue to decreasing total population of the country, only 8 prefectures show increase in population. These are [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]](2.9%), [[Tokyo]](2.7%), [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]](1.0%), [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]](1.0%), [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]](0.9%), [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]](0.6%), [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]](0.2%), and [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]](0.1%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/data/nihon/02.html|title=\u7d71\u8a08\u5c40\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30da\u30fc\u30b8/\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u7d71\u8a08 2018\uff0d\u7b2c2\u7ae0\u3000\u4eba\u53e3\u30fb\u4e16\u5e2f|last=\u7dcf\u52d9\u7701\u7d71\u8a08\u5c40|website=www.stat.go.jp|language=ja|access-date=2018-06-15}}</ref>\n\n===Emigration===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2008}}\n{{Main article|Japanese diaspora}}\nAbout 663,300 Japanese were living abroad, approximately 75,000 of whom had permanent foreign residency, more than six times the number who had that status in 1975. More than 200,000 Japanese went abroad in 1990 for extended periods of study, research, or business assignments. As the government and private corporations have stressed internationalization, greater numbers of individuals have been directly affected, decreasing Japan's historical insularity. By the late 1980s, these problems, particularly the bullying of returnee children in schools, had become a major public issue both in Japan and in Japanese communities abroad.\n\n'''Cities with significant populations of Japanese nationals'''\n* [[Los Angeles]], United States: 68,689\n* [[Bangkok]], Thailand: 48,700\n* [[Shanghai]], China: 46,115\n* [[New York City|New York]], United States: 44,636\n* [[Singapore]]: 36,963\n* [[London]], United Kingdom: 36,721\n* [[Sydney]], Australia: 30,448\n* [[Vancouver]], Canada: 26,999\n* [[Hong Kong]], China: 26,869\n* [[San Francisco]], United States: 18,777\n* [[Toronto]], Canada: 13,410\n\nNote: The above data shows the number of Japanese nationals living overseas.

This is because Japanese law does not recognise dual citizenship after the age of adulthood, and so people becoming naturalised Japanese citizens must relinquish citizenship of other countries when they reach the age of 20. Some ethnic Koreans and Chinese and their descendants (who may speak only Japanese and may never have even visited the country whose nationality they hold) do not wish to abandon this other citizenship.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn addition, people taking Japanese citizenship must take a name using the Japanese character sets hiragana, katakana, and/or kanji.  Names using Western alphabet, Korean alphabet, Arabic characters, etc. are not acceptable as legal names.  Chinese characters are usually legally acceptable as nearly all Chinese characters are recognized as valid by the Japanese government.  Transliterations of non-Japanese names using katakana (e.g. {{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30df\u30b9}}\u3000\"{{transl|ja|Sumisu}}\" for \"Smith\") are also legally acceptable.\n\nHowever, some naturalizing foreigners feel that becoming a Japanese citizen should mean that they have a Japanese name and that they should abandon their foreign name, and some foreign residents do not wish to do this\u2014although most [[Special Permanent Resident (Japan)|Special Permanent Resident]] Koreans and Chinese already use Japanese names.

The largest are the ''hisabetsu buraku'' or \"discriminated communities\", also known as the ''burakumin''. These descendants of premodern outcast hereditary occupational groups, such as [[butcher]]s, [[leather]]workers, [[funeral director]]s, and certain entertainers, may be considered a Japanese analog of [[India]]'s [[Dalit (outcaste)|Dalits]]. Discrimination against these occupational groups arose historically because of [[Buddhist]] prohibitions against killing and [[Shinto]] notions of pollution, as well as governmental attempts at social control.\n\nDuring the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] period, such people were required to live in special ''buraku'' and, like the rest of the population, were bound by [[sumptuary law]]s based on the inheritance of social class. The [[Meiji period|Meiji]] government abolished most derogatory names applied to these discriminated communities in 1871, but the new laws had little effect on the social discrimination faced by the former outcasts and their descendants. The laws, however, did eliminate the economic monopoly they had over certain occupations. The ''buraku'' continued to be treated as social outcasts and some casual interactions with the majority caste were perceived [[taboo]] until the era after World War II.\n\nEstimates of their number range from 2 to 4&nbsp;million (about 2% to 3% of the national population). Although members of these discriminated communities are physically indistinguishable from other Japanese, they often live in urban [[ghetto]]es or in the traditional special hamlets in rural areas, and membership can be surmised from the location of the family home, occupation, dialect, or mannerisms.  Checks on family background designed to ferret out ''buraku'' were commonly performed as part of marriage arrangements and employment applications, but have been illegal since 1985 in Osaka.\n\nPast and current discrimination has resulted in lower educational attainment and socioeconomic status among ''hisabetsu buraku'' than among the majority of Japanese. Movements with objectives ranging from \"liberation\" to encouraging integration have tried to change this situation, with some success.  Nadamoto Masahisa of the Buraku History Institute estimates that as of 1998, between 60 and 80% of burakumin marry a non-burakumin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nancho.net/kyoto/nadamoto.html |title=Kyoto Ijin: Nadamoto Masahisa |website=Nancho.net |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}</ref>\n\n===Ryukyuans===\nOne of the largest minority groups among Japanese citizens is the [[Ryukyuans|Ryukyuan people]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910845577|title=The international handbook of the demography of race and ethnicity|others=Saenz, Rogelio,, Embrick, David G.,, Rodriguez, N\u00e9stor,|isbn=9789048188918|location=Dordrecht|oclc=910845577}}</ref>.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  They are primarily distinguished from their use of several distinct [[Ryukyuan languages]] though use of Ryukyuan is dying out.

Historically, the Ainu were an indigenous [[hunting]] and gathering population who occupied most of northern Honsh\u016b as late as the Nara period (A.D.&nbsp;710\u201394). As Japanese settlement expanded, the Ainu were pushed northward, by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the Ainu were pushed into the island of Hokkaido.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shinichiro|first=Takakura|title=The Ainu of Northern Japan: A Study in Conquest and Acculturation|year=1960|publisher=The American Philosophical Society|location=Independence Square|pages=24\u201325}}</ref>\n\nCharacterized as remnants of a primitive circumpolar culture, the fewer than 20,000&nbsp;Ainu in 1990 were considered racially distinct and thus not fully Japanese. Disease and a low birth rate had severely diminished their numbers over the past two centuries, and intermarriage had brought about an almost completely mixed population.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAlthough no longer in daily use, the [[Ainu language]] is preserved in epics, songs, and stories transmitted orally over succeeding generations.

From the early 1980s, a civil disobedience movement encouraged refusal of the [[fingerprint]]ing that accompanied registration every five years.\n\nOpponents of fingerprinting argued that it was discriminatory because the only Japanese who were fingerprinted were criminals. The courts upheld fingerprinting, but the law was changed so that fingerprinting was done once rather than with each renewal of the registration, which until a law reform in 1989 was usually required every six months for anybody from the age of 16. Those refusing fingerprinting were denied re-entry permits, thus depriving them of freedom of movement.\n\nOf these foreign residents below, the new wave started 2014 comes to Japan as students or trainees. These foreigners are registered under student visa or trainee visa which gives them the student residency status, Most of these new foreigners are under this visa.

LDP was a ruling party during decades since 1955. Despite of existence of multiple parties, other parties were completely ignored. Most of the prime ministers were elected from inner factions of LDP. \n \n[[File:Japanese General election, 2005 en.svg|thumb|right|House of Representatives Election in 2005]]\n[[File:Japanese House of Councillors election, 2007 en.svg|thumb|right|House of Councillors election in 2007]]\n{{elect|List of political parties in Japan|Elections in Japan}}\n{{Japanese general election, 2009}}\n{{Main|Japanese general election, 2009}}\n{{Japanese House of Councillors election, 2010}}\n[[File:46th House of Representatives of Japan seat composition.svg|thumb|200px|Seating after the election.<br>\n{{legend|#009933|[[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] (294)}}\n{{legend|#E60000|[[Democratic Party of Japan|DPJ]]/Club of Independents (57)}}\n{{legend|#6FBA2C|[[Japan Restoration Party|Restoration]] (54)}}\n{{legend|#FFFF00|[[New Komeito Party|K\u014dmeit\u014d]] (31)}}\n{{legend|#0000FF|[[Your Party|YP]] (18)}}\n{{legend|#00A550|[[Tomorrow Party of Japan|Tomorrow]] (9)}}\n{{legend|#000000|[[Japanese Communist Party|JCP]] (8)}}\n{{legend|#A0A0A0|Independents (5)}}\n{{legend|#007FFF|[[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|SDP]]/Shimin Reng\u014d (2)}}\n{{legend|#FFA850|[[People's New Party|PNP]] (1)}}\n{{legend|#cd853f|[[New Party Diachi|NPD]](1)}}]]\n{{Japanese general election, 2012}}\n{{Japanese general election, 2014}}\n\n==Policy making==\nDespite an increasingly unpredictable domestic and international environment, policy making conforms to well established postwar patterns. The close collaboration of the ruling party, the [[Civil service of Japan|elite bureaucracy]] and important interest groups often make it difficult to tell who exactly is responsible for specific policy decisions.\n\n===Policy development in Japan===\nAfter a largely informal process within elite circles in which ideas were discussed and developed, steps might be taken to institute more formal policy development. This process often took place in deliberation councils (''shingikai''). There were about 200 ''shingikai'', each attached to a ministry; their members were both officials and prominent private individuals in business, education, and other fields. The ''shingikai'' played a large role in facilitating communication among those who ordinarily might not meet.\n\nGiven the tendency for real negotiations in Japan to be conducted privately (in the ''[[nemawashi]]'', or root binding, process of consensus building), the ''shingikai'' often represented a fairly advanced stage in policy formulation in which relatively minor differences could be thrashed out and the resulting decisions couched in language acceptable to all. These bodies were legally established but had no authority to oblige governments to adopt their recommendations. The most important deliberation council during the 1980s was the Provisional Commission for Administrative Reform, established in March 1981 by Prime Minister [[Suzuki Zenko]]. The commission had nine members, assisted in their deliberations by six advisers, twenty-one \"expert members,\" and around fifty \"councillors\" representing a wide range of groups. Its head, [[Keidanren]] president [[Doko Toshio]], insisted that government agree to take its recommendations seriously and commit itself to reforming the administrative structure and the tax system.\n\nIn 1982, the commission had arrived at several recommendations that by the end of the decade had been actualized. These implementations included tax reform, a policy to limit government growth, the establishment in 1984 of the [[Management and Coordination Agency]] to replace the Administrative Management Agency in the Office of the Prime Minister, and privatization of the [[Japanese public corporations|state-owned railroad and telephone systems]]. In April 1990, another deliberation council, the Election Systems Research Council, submitted proposals that included the establishment of single-seat constituencies in place of the multiple-seat system.\n\nAnother significant policy-making institution in the early 1990s were the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]]'s [[Policy Research Council (LDP of Japan)|Policy Research Council]]. It consisted of a number of committees, composed of LDP Diet members, with the committees corresponding to the different executive agencies. Committee members worked closely with their official counterparts, advancing the requests of their constituents, in one of the most effective means through which interest groups could state their case to the bureaucracy through the channel of the ruling party.  \n''See also:'' [[Industrial policy of Japan]]; [[Monetary and fiscal policy of Japan]]; [[Mass media and politics in Japan]]\n\n== Post-war political developments in Japan ==\nPolitical parties had begun to revive almost immediately after the [[Occupied Japan|occupation]] began. [[Left-wing]] organizations, such as the [[Japan Socialist Party]] and the [[Japanese Communist Party]], quickly reestablished themselves, as did various conservative parties. The old [[Rikken Seiy\u016bkai]] and [[Rikken Minseit\u014d]] came back as, respectively, the Liberal Party ([[Nihon Jiy\u016bt\u014d]]) and the [[Japan Progressive Party]] (Nihon Shimpot\u014d). The first postwar elections were held in 1948 (women were given the franchise for the first time in 1947), and the Liberal Party's vice president, [[Yoshida Shigeru]] (1878\u20131967), became prime minister.\n\nFor the 1947 elections, anti-Yoshida forces left the Liberal Party and joined forces with the Progressive Party to establish the new [[Democratic Party of Japan|Democratic Party]] (Minshut\u014d). This divisiveness in conservative ranks gave a plurality to the Japan Socialist Party, which was allowed to form a cabinet, which lasted less than a year. Thereafter, the socialist party steadily declined in its electoral successes. After a short period of Democratic Party administration, Yoshida returned in late 1948 and continued to serve as prime minister until 1954.\n\nEven before Japan regained full sovereignty, the government had rehabilitated nearly 80,000 people who had been purged, many of whom returned to their former political and government positions. A debate over limitations on [[Defense budget of Japan|military spending]] and the [[Controversies regarding the role of the Emperor of Japan|sovereignty of the Emperor]] ensued, contributing to the great reduction in the Liberal Party's majority in the first post-occupation elections (October 1952). After several reorganizations of the armed forces, in 1954 the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] were established under a civilian director. [[Cold War]] realities and the hot [[Korean war|war]] in nearby Korea also contributed significantly to the United States-influenced economic redevelopment, the suppression of communism, and the discouragement of [[organized labor]] in Japan during this period.\n\nContinual fragmentation of parties and a succession of [[minority government]]s led conservative forces to merge the Liberal Party (Jiy\u016bt\u014d) with the Japan Democratic Party (Nihon Minshut\u014d), an offshoot of the earlier Democratic Party, to form the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (Jiy\u016b-Minshut\u014d; LDP) in November 1955, called [[1955 System]]. This party continuously held power from 1955 through 1993, except for short when it was replaced by a new minority government. LDP leadership was drawn from the elite who had seen Japan through the defeat and occupation. It attracted former bureaucrats, local politicians, businessmen, journalists, other professionals, farmers, and university graduates.\n\nIn October 1955, socialist groups reunited under the [[Japan Socialist Party]], which emerged as the second most powerful political force. It was followed closely in popularity by the [[K\u014dmeit\u014d]], founded in 1964 as the political arm of the [[Soka Gakkai]] (Value Creation Society), until 1991, a lay organization affiliated with the [[Nichiren Shoshu]] Buddhist sect. The Komeito emphasized the traditional Japanese beliefs and attracted urban laborers, former rural residents, and women. Like the [[Japan Socialist Party]], it favored the gradual modification and dissolution of the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact]].\n\n== Political developments since 1990 ==\nThe LDP domination lasted until the Diet Lower House elections on 18 July 1993, in which LDP failed to win a [[Majority government|majority]]. A [[Coalition government|coalition]] of new parties and existing opposition parties formed a governing majority and elected a new prime minister, [[Morihiro Hosokawa]], in August 1993. His government's major legislative objective was political reform, consisting of a package of new political financing restrictions and major changes in the [[electoral system]]. The coalition succeeded in passing landmark political reform legislation in January 1994.\n\nIn April 1994, Prime Minister Hosokawa resigned. Prime Minister [[Tsutomu Hata]] formed the successor coalition government, Japan's first minority government in almost 40 years. Prime Minister Hata resigned less than two months later. Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]] formed the next government in June 1994 with the coalition of [[Japan Socialist Party]] (JSP), the LDP, and the small [[New Party Sakigake]]. The advent of a coalition containing the JSP and LDP shocked many observers because of their previously fierce rivalry.\n\nPrime Minister Murayama served from June 1994 to January 1996. He was succeeded by Prime Minister [[Ryutaro Hashimoto]], who served from January 1996 to July 1998. Prime Minister Hashimoto headed a loose coalition of three parties until the July 1998 Upper House election, when the two smaller parties cut ties with the LDP. Hashimoto resigned due to a poor electoral performance by the LDP in the Upper House elections. He was succeeded as party president of the LDP and prime minister by Keizo Obuchi, who took office on 30 July 1998. The LDP formed a governing coalition with the [[Liberal Party of Japan (1998)|Liberal Party]] in January 1999, and [[Keizo Obuchi]] remained prime minister. The LDP-Liberal coalition expanded to include the New Komeito Party in October 1999.\n\n== Political developments since 2000 ==\nPrime Minister Obuchi suffered a stroke in April 2000 and was replaced by [[Yoshir\u014d Mori]]. After the Liberal Party left the coalition in April 2000, Prime Minister Mori welcomed a Liberal Party splinter group, the [[New Conservative Party]], into the ruling coalition. The three-party coalition made up of the LDP, New Komeito, and the New Conservative Party maintained its majority in the Diet following the June 2000 Lower House elections.\n\nAfter a turbulent year in office in which he saw his approval ratings plummet to the single digits, Prime Minister Mori agreed to hold early elections for the LDP presidency in order to improve his party's chances in crucial July 2001 Upper House elections. On 24 April 2001, riding a wave of grassroots desire for change, maverick politician [[Junichiro Koizumi]] defeated former Prime Minister Hashimoto and other party stalwarts on a platform of economic and political reform.\n\nKoizumi was elected as Japan's 87th Prime Minister on 26 April 2001. On 11 October 2003, Prime Minister Koizumi dissolved the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] and he was re-elected as the president of the LDP. Likewise, that year, the LDP won the [[Japan general election, 2003|election]], even though it suffered setbacks from the new opposition party, the [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[social-democratic]] [[Democratic Party of Japan|Democratic Party]] (DPJ). A similar event occurred during the 2004 Upper House elections as well.\n\nIn a strong move, on 8 August 2005, Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] called for a [[Japan general election, 2005|snap election]] to the lower house, as threatened, after LDP stalwarts and opposition DPJ parliamentarians defeated his proposal for a large-scale reform and privatization of [[Japan Post]], which besides being Japan's state-owned postal monopoly is arguably the world's largest financial institution, with nearly 331 trillion yen of assets. The election was scheduled for 11 September 2005, with the LDP achieving a landslide victory under [[Junichiro Koizumi]]'s leadership.\n\nThe ruling LDP started losing hold since 2006. No prime minister except Koizumi had good public support. On 26 September 2006, new LDP President [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] was elected by a special session of the Diet to succeed [[Junichiro Koizumi]] as Prime Minister. He was the Japan's youngest post-World War II prime minister and the first born after the war. On 12 September 2007, Abe surprised Japan by announcing his resignation from office. He was replaced by [[Yasuo Fukuda]], a veteran of LDP.\n\nIn the meantime, on 4 November 2007, leader of the main opposition party, [[Ichir\u014d Ozawa]] announced his resignation from the post of party president, after controversy over an offer to the DPJ to join the ruling coalition in a [[grand coalition]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japannewsreview.com/politics/politics/20071104page_id=2861|title=DPJ leader Ozawa hands in resignation over grand coalition controversy \u2013 Japan News Review<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=japannewsreview.com|accessdate=17 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109084410/http://www.japannewsreview.com/politics/politics/20071104page_id=2861|archivedate=9 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> but has since, with some embarrassment, rescinded his resignation.\n\nOn 11 January 2008, Prime Minister [[Yasuo Fukuda]] forced a bill allowing ships to continue a refueling mission in the Indian Ocean in support of US-led operations in Afghanistan.  To do so, PM Fukuda used the LDP's overwhelming majority in the Lower House to ignore a previous \"no-vote\" of the opposition-controlled Upper House.  This was the first time in 50 years that the Lower House voted to ignore the opinion of the Upper House. Fukuda resigned suddenly on 1 September 2008, just a few weeks after reshuffling his cabinet. On 1 September 2008, Fukuda's resignation was designed so that the LDP did not suffer a \"power vacuum\". It thus caused a leadership election within the LDP, and the winner, [[Tar\u014d As\u014d]] was chosen as the new party president and on 24 September 2008, he was appointed as 92nd Prime Minister after the House of Representatives voted in his favor in the extraordinary session of Diet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080924x1.html|title=Page not found|author=|date=|website=The Japan Times|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nLater, on 21 July 2009, Prime Minister As\u014d dissolved the House of Representatives and [[Japanese general election, 2009|elections]] were held on 30 August.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2009/07/22/editorials/critical-election-to-come/|title=Critical election to come - The Japan Times|author=|date=|website=japantimes.co.jp|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\nThe election results for the House of Representatives were announced on 30 and 31 August 2009.

Local deposits of metal-bearing ores were difficult to process because they were low grade. The nation's large and varied forest resources, which covered 70 percent of the country in the late 1980s, were not utilized extensively. Because of political decisions on local, prefectural, and national levels, Japan decided not to exploit its forest resources for economic gain. Domestic sources only supplied between 25 and 30 percent of the nation's timber needs. Agriculture and fishing were the best developed resources, but only through years of painstaking investment and toil. The nation therefore built up the manufacturing and processing industries to convert raw materials imported from abroad. This strategy of economic development necessitated the establishment of a strong economic infrastructure to provide the needed energy, transportation, communications, and technological know-how.\n\nDeposits of [[gold]], [[magnesium]], and [[silver]] meet current industrial demands, but Japan is dependent on foreign sources for many of the minerals essential to modern industry. [[Iron ore]], [[copper]], [[bauxite]], and [[alumina]] must be imported, as well as many forest products.\n\n==Economic history==\n[[File:Hiroshige, Sugura street.jpg|thumb|An 1856 [[ukiyo-e]] depicting Echigoya, the current [[Mitsukoshi]]]]\n{{Main|Economic history of Japan}}\n\nThe [[economic history of Japan]] is one of the most studied economies for its spectacular growth in three different periods.

It was densely populated and urbanized. Prominent European observers of the time seemed to agree that the Japanese ''\"excel not only all the other Oriental peoples, they surpass the Europeans as well\"'' ([[Alessandro Valignano]], 1584, \"Historia del Principo y Progresso de la Compania de Jesus en las Indias Orientales).\n\nEarly European visitors were amazed by the quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This stems from the fact that Japan itself is rather rich in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially iron.\n\nThe cargo of the first Portuguese ships (usually about 4 smaller-sized ships every year) arriving in Japan almost entirely consisted of Chinese goods (silk, porcelain). The Japanese were very much looking forward to acquiring such goods, but had been prohibited from any contacts with the [[Emperor of China]], as a punishment for [[Wokou|Wak\u014d]] pirate raids. The Portuguese (who were called ''Nanban'', lit. Southern Barbarians) therefore found the opportunity to act as intermediaries in Asian trade.\n\n===Edo period (1603\u20131868)===\n<!-- PLEASE MAKE CHANGES TO THE MAIN ARTICLES AND THEN UPDATE HERE-->\n[[File:\u9d8f\u6587\u9aed\u76bf \u80a5\u524d\u713c\u30fb\u53e4\u4f0a\u4e07\u91cc\u69d8\u5f0f-Barber's Bowl with Cockerel MET DP281043 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Japanese export porcelain]] in the European shape of a barber's basin, with copulating cock, around 1700.]]\nThe beginning of the [[Edo period]] coincides with the last decades of the [[Nanban trade period]], during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built her first ocean-going Western-style warships, such as the [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']], a 500-ton [[galleon]]-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] to the Americas, which then continued to Europe. Also during that period, the ''bakufu'' commissioned around 350 [[Red Seal Ships]], three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as [[Yamada Nagamasa]], were active throughout Asia.\n\nIn order to eradicate the influence of [[Christianization]], Japan entered in a period of isolation called [[sakoku]], during which its economy enjoyed stability and mild progress.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan/The-bakuhan-system#ref319463|title=The Bakuhan System|last=|first=|date=February 15, 2018|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|access-date=February 17, 2018}}</ref>  But not long after, in the 1650s, the production of [[Japanese export porcelain]] increased greatly when civil war put the main Chinese center of porcelain production, [[Jingdezhen porcelain|in Jingdezhen]], out of action for several decades. For the rest of the 17th century most [[Japanese porcelain]] production was for export, mostly in [[Kyushu]]. The trade dwindled under renewed Chinese competition by the 1740s, before resuming after the opening of Japan in the mid-19th century.<ref>[[David Battie|Battie, David]], ed., ''Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain'', pp. 71-78, 1990, Conran Octopus. {{ISBN|1850292515}}</ref>     \n\nEconomic development during the Edo period included [[urbanization]], increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign [[commerce]], and a diffusion of trade and [[handicraft]] industries. The [[construction]] trades flourished, along with banking facilities and [[merchant]] associations. Increasingly, [[Han (country subdivision)|''han'']] authorities oversaw the rising [[agriculture|agricultural]] production and the spread of rural handicrafts.\n\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, Edo had a population of more than 1 million and [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]] each had more than 400,000 inhabitants. Many other [[castle town]]s grew as well. Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods.\n\nRice was the base of the economy, as the daimyo collected the taxes from the peasants in the form of rice. Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the ''[[fudasashi]]'' market in [[Edo]]. To raise money, the daimyo used [[forward contract]]s to sell rice that was not even harvested yet. These contracts were similar to modern [[futures trading]].\n\nDuring the period, Japan progressively studied Western sciences and techniques (called ''[[rangaku]]'', literally \"Dutch studies\") through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in [[Dejima]]. The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or [[wadokei]], inspired from Western techniques.\n\n===Pre-war period (1868\u20131945)===\n<!-- PLEASE MAKE CHANGES TO THE MAIN ARTICLES AND THEN UPDATE HERE-->\n\nSince the mid-19th century, after the [[Meiji Restoration]], the country was opened up to Western commerce and influence and Japan has gone through two periods of economic development. The first began in earnest in 1868 and extended through to World War II; the second began in 1945 and continued into the mid-1980s.\n\nEconomic developments of the [[Empire of Japan|prewar period]] began with the \"[[Fukoku ky\u014dhei|Rich State and Strong Army Policy]]\" by the [[Meiji government]]. During the [[Meiji period]] (1868\u20131912), leaders inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan ([[Oyatoi gaikokujin]]). The government also built railroads, improved road, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development.\n\nTo promote [[industrialization]], the government decided that, while it should help private business to allocate resources and to plan, the public sector was best equipped to stimulate economic growth. The greatest role of government was to help provide good economic conditions for business. In short, government was to be the guide and business the producer. In the early Meiji period, the government built factories and shipyards that were sold to entrepreneurs at a fraction of their value. Many of these businesses grew rapidly into the larger [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Government emerged as chief promoter of [[private enterprise]], enacting a series of probusiness policies.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, the Japanese nominal wage rates were \"10 times less\" than the one of the U.S (based on mid-1930s exchange rates), while the price level is estimated to have been about 44% the one of the U.S.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fukao |first=Kyoji |title=Real GDP in Pre-War East Asia: A 1934\u201336 Benchmark Purchasing Power Parity Comparison with the US |year=2007 |url=http://gpih.ucdavis.edu/files/Fukao_Ma_Yuan.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n===Postwar period (1945\u2013present)===\n[[File:2005Japanese exports.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Japanese exports in 2005]]\n{{See also|Japanese post-war economic miracle|Economic history of Japan}}\n\nFrom the 1960s to the 1980s, overall real economic growth was extremely large: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and a 4% average in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-7176.html | title = Japan: Patterns of Development | publisher = country-data.com |date=January 1994 | accessdate=28 December 2006}}</ref> By the end of said period, Japan had moved into being a high-wage economy.<ref>Business in context: an introduction to business and its environment by David Needle</ref>\n\nGrowth slowed markedly in the late 1990s also termed [[Lost Decade (Japan)|the Lost Decade]] after the collapse of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]]. As a consequence Japan ran massive budget deficits (added trillions in Yen to Japanese financial system) to finance large [[public works]] programs.\n\nBy 1998, Japan's public works projects still could not stimulate demand enough to end the economy's stagnation. In desperation, the Japanese government undertook \"structural reform\" policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Unfortunately, these policies led Japan into deflation on numerous occasions between 1999 and 2004. In his 1998 paper, Japan's Trap, Princeton economics professor [[Paul Krugman]] argued that based on a number of models, Japan had a new option. Krugman's plan called for a rise in inflation expectations to, in effect, cut long-term interest rates and promote spending.<ref name=\"krugman\">{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/japtrap.html |title=Japan's Trap | publisher = [[MIT]] | date = 19 May 1999 | accessdate=6 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nJapan used another technique, somewhat based on Krugman's, called [[Quantitative easing]]. As opposed to flooding the money market with newly printed money, the Bank of Japan expanded the money supply internally to raise expectations of inflation. Initially, the policy failed to induce any growth, but it eventually began to affect inflationary expectations. By late 2005, the economy finally began what seems to be a sustained recovery. GDP growth for that year was 2.8%, with an annualized fourth quarter expansion of 5.5%, surpassing the growth rates of the US and [[Economy of the European Union|European Union]] during the same period.<ref>Masake, Hisane.

It is considered an important element in any major change, before any formal steps are taken, and successful ''nemawashi'' enables changes to be carried out with the consent of all sides.\n\nJapanese companies are known for management methods such as \"[[The Toyota Way]]\". [[Kaizen]] ([[wikt:\u6539\u5584|\u6539\u5584]], Japanese for \"improvement\") is a Japanese philosophy that focuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of life. When applied to the workplace, Kaizen activities continually improve all functions of a business, from manufacturing to management and from the CEO to the assembly line workers.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Imai\n | first = Masaaki\n | title = Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success\n | location = New York, NY\n | publisher = Random House\n | year = 1986\n}}</ref> By improving standardized activities and processes, Kaizen aims to eliminate waste (see [[Lean manufacturing]]). Kaizen was first implemented in several Japanese businesses during the country's recovery after World War II, including Toyota, and has since spread to businesses throughout the world.<ref>Europe Japan Centre, Kaizen Strategies for Improving Team Performance, Ed. Michael Colenso, London: Pearson Education Limited, 2000</ref> Within certain value systems, it is ironic that Japanese workers labor amongst the most hours per day, even though kaizen is supposed to improve all aspects of life.\n\nSome companies have powerful enterprise unions and ''[[shunt\u014d]]''.  The [[Nenko System]] or Nenko Joretsu, as it is called in Japan, is the Japanese system of promoting an employee based on his or her proximity to [[retirement]]. The advantage of the system is that it allows older employees to achieve a higher salary level before retirement and it usually brings more experience to the executive ranks. The disadvantage of the system is that it does not allow new talent to be combined with experience and those with specialized skills cannot be promoted to the already crowded executive ranks. It also does not guarantee or even attempt to bring the \"right person for the right job\".\n\nRelationships between government bureaucrats and companies are often close. {{Nihongo|[[Amakudari]]|\u5929\u4e0b\u308a|amakudari|\"descent from heaven\"}} is the institutionalised practice where Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high-profile positions in the private and public sectors. The practice is increasingly viewed as corrupt and a limitation on efforts to reduce ties between the private sector and the state that prevent economic and political reforms.

Its frequent use by Japanese corporations, and its prevalence in Japanese [[manga]] and anime has gradually led to its acceptance in English-speaking countries as a noun for a Japanese [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] businessman. The word can be found in many books and articles pertaining to Japanese culture. Immediately following World War II, becoming a salaryman was viewed as a gateway to a stable, middle-class lifestyle. In modern use, the term carries associations of long working hours, low prestige in the corporate hierarchy, absence of significant sources of income other than salary, [[wage slavery]], and [[kar\u014dshi]]. The term salaryman refers almost exclusively to males.\n\nAn [[office lady]], often abbreviated OL (Japanese: \u30aa\u30fc\u30a8\u30eb ''\u014ceru''), is a female [[office worker]] in Japan who performs generally [[pink collar]] tasks such as serving tea and [[secretary|secretarial]] or [[clerk (position)|clerical]] work. Like many unmarried Japanese, OLs often [[parasite single|live with their parents]] well into [[early adulthood]]. Office ladies are usually [[full time|full-time]] permanent staff, although the jobs they do usually have little opportunity for [[promotion (rank)|promotion]], and there is usually the [[wikt:tacit|tacit]] expectation that they leave their jobs once they get married.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[Freeter]]|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc|fur\u012bt\u0101}} (other spellings below) is a Japanese expression for people between the age of 15 and 34 who lack full-time employment or are unemployed, excluding homemakers and students. They may also be described as ''[[underemployment|underemployed]]'' or [[freelance]] workers. These people do not start a [[career]] after [[Secondary education in Japan|high school]] or [[List of universities in Japan|university]] but instead usually live as [[parasite single]]s with their parents and earn some money with low skilled and low paid jobs. The low income makes it difficult for freeters to start a family, and the lack of qualifications makes it difficult to start a career at a later point in life.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[Kar\u014dshi]]|\u904e\u52b4\u6b7b|''kar\u014dshi''}}, which can be translated quite literally from Japanese as \"[[death from overwork]]\", is occupational sudden death. The major medical causes of kar\u014dshi deaths are heart attack and stroke due to stress.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[S\u014dkaiya]]|\u7dcf\u4f1a\u5c4b|s\u014dkaiya}}, (sometimes also translated as ''corporate bouncers'', ''meeting-men'', or ''corporate blackmailers'') are a form of specialized [[racketeer]] unique to Japan, and often associated with the [[yakuza]] that extort money from or blackmail companies by threatening to publicly [[Humiliation|humiliate]] companies and their management, usually in their {{Nihongo|annual meeting|\u7dcf\u4f1a|s\u014dkai}}.  {{Nihongo|[[Sarakin]]|\u30b5\u30e9\u91d1}} is a Japanese term for moneylender, or [[loan shark]]. It is a contraction of the Japanese words for [[salaryman]] and cash. Around 14 million people, or 10% of the Japanese population, have borrowed from a ''sarakin''. In total, there are about 10,000 firms (down from 30,000 a decade ago); however, the top seven firms make up 70% of the market. The value of outstanding loans totals $100 billion.

When the roots are considered, however, [[Matsuzakaya]] has an even longer history, dated from 1611. The kimono store changed to a department store in 1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in [[Ginza]] allowed street shoes to be worn indoors, something innovative at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matsuzakaya.co.jp/corporate/history/honshi/index.shtml |title=\u677e\u5742\u5c4b\u300c\u3072\u3068\u30fb\u3053\u3068\u30fb\u3082\u306e\u300d\u8a9e\u308a |publisher=Matsuzakaya.co.jp |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref> These former kimono shop department stores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold, or rather displayed, luxurious products, which contributed for their sophisticated atmospheres. Another origin of Japanese department store is that from railway company. There have been many [[private railway]] operators in the nation, and from the 1920s, they started to build department stores directly linked to their lines' [[Terminal train station|termini]]. [[Seibu Department Stores|Seibu]] and [[Hankyu Department Stores|Hankyu]] are the typical examples of this type.  From the 1980s onwards, Japanese department stores face fierce competition from supermarkets and convenience stores, gradually losing their presences. Still, ''dep\u0101to'' are bastions of several aspects of cultural conservatism in the country. Gift certificates for prestigious department stores are frequently given as formal presents in Japan. Department stores in Japan generally offer a wide range of services and can include [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], travel reservations, ticket sales for local concerts and other events.\n\n===Keiretsu===\n{{Main|Keiretsu}}\nA {{Nihongo|[[keiretsu]]|\u7cfb\u5217|extra=\"system\" or \"series\"}} is a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. It is a type of [[business group]]. The prototypical ''keiretsu'' appeared in Japan during the \"[[Japanese post-war economic miracle|economic miracle]]\" following World War II. Before Japan's surrender, Japanese industry was controlled by large family-controlled [[vertical monopoly|vertical monopolies]] called ''[[zaibatsu]]''. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] dismantled the ''zaibatsu'' in the late 1940s, but the companies formed from the dismantling of the ''zaibatsu'' were reintegrated.  The dispersed corporations were re-interlinked through share purchases to form horizontally integrated alliances across many industries. Where possible, ''keiretsu'' companies would also supply one another, making the alliances vertically integrated as well.  In this period, official government policy promoted the creation of robust trade corporations that could withstand pressures from intensified world trade competition.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1954/07/17/archives/japan-again-plans-huge-corporations.html?sq=ogasawara&scp=46&st=p  \"Japan Again Plans Huge Corporations,\"] ''New York Times.'' 17 July 1954.</ref>\n\nThe major ''keiretsu'' were each centered on one bank, which lent money to the ''keiretsu's'' member companies and held equity positions in the companies. Each central bank had great control over the companies in the ''keiretsu'' and acted as a monitoring entity and as an emergency bail-out entity. One effect of this structure was to minimize the presence of [[hostile takeover]]s in Japan, because no entities could challenge the power of the banks.\n\nThere are two types of ''keiretsu'': vertical and horizontal. Vertical ''keiretsu'' illustrates the organization and relationships within a company (for example all factors of production of a certain product are connected), while a horizontal ''keiretsu'' shows relationships between entities and industries, normally centered on a bank and trading company. Both are complexly woven together and sustain each other.\n\nThe Japanese recession in the 1990s had profound effects on the keiretsu. Many of the largest banks were hit hard by bad loan portfolios and forced to merge or go out of business. This had the effect of blurring the lines between the keiretsu: [[Sumitomo Bank]] and [[Mitsui]] Bank, for instance, became [[Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation]] in 2001, while [[Sanwa Bank]] (the banker for the Hankyu-Toho Group) became part of [[Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ]]. Additionally, many companies from outside the keiretsu system, such as [[Sony]], began outperforming their counterparts within the system.\n\nGenerally, these causes gave rise to a strong notion in the business community that the old keiretsu system was not an effective business model, and led to an overall loosening of keiretsu alliances. While the keiretsu still exist, they are not as centralized or integrated as they were before the 1990s. This, in turn, has led to a growing [[corporate acquisition]] industry in Japan, as companies are no longer able to be easily \"bailed out\" by their banks, as well as rising [[derivative litigation]] by more independent shareholders.\n\n== Mergers and Acquisitions ==\nJapanese companies have been involved in 50,759 deals between 1985 and 2018. This cumulates to a total value of 2,636 bil. USD which translates to 281,469.9 bil.

This took place in the midst of the rapid [[industrialization]] and social reorganization that the [[Meiji period]] symbolized in [[History of Japan|Japanese history]].

News vendors of the [[Tokugawa period]], taking place from 1603 to 1867, typically promoted publications by reading the contents aloud and handed out papers that were [[Woodblock printing in Japan|printed from hand-graven blocks]]. Widespread adoption of [[movable type]] took place as Japanese society modernized. In particular, ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', a national daily newspaper that became the country's largest by [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]], was founded in 1874 and designed to be read in detail using standard [[Japanese language|Japanese vernacular]]. Five such dailies got started early in the [[Meiji period]], taking place from 1868 to 1912. ''Yomiuri'' specifically took direct influence from [[Newspapers in the United States|American publications]] controlled by [[William Randolph Hearst]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yomiuri-shimbun|title=Yomiuri shimbun - Japanese newspaper|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe first such mass newspaper to be founded was the ''Nagasaki Shipping List & Advertiser'', established in 1861 in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] by the Englishman A.W. Hansard. Its first issue ran 22 June of that year. The newspaper, which notably discussed matters in the [[English language]], laid the groundwork for Hansard's later publication ''Japan Herald''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gallery.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/nsla/index.html|title=The Nagasaki Shipping List and Advertiser|website=gallery.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp}}</ref>\n\nThe broadcast industry has been dominated by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (Nippon Hoso Kyokai\u2014[[NHK]]) since its founding in 1925.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the postwar period, NHK's budget and operations were under the purview of the [[Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (Japan)|Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications]], the [[Broadcasting Law]] of 1950 provides for independent management and programming by NHK. Television [[broadcasting]] began in 1953, and [[color television]] was introduced in 1960. Cable television was introduced in 1969. In 1978 an experimental broadcast satellite with two color television channels was launched. Operational satellites for television use were launched between 1984 and 1990. Television viewing spread so rapidly that, by 1987, 99 percent of Japan's households had color television sets and the average family had its set on at least five hours a day. Starting in 1987, NHK began full-scale experimental broadcasting on two channels using satellite-to-audience signals, thus bringing service to remote and mountainous parts of the country that earlier had experienced poor reception. The new system also provided twenty-four hours a day, nonstop service.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the late 1980s, NHK operated two public [[television]] and three [[radio]] networks nationally, producing about 1,700 programs per week. Its general and education programs were broadcast through more than 6,900 television stations and nearly 330 AM and more than 500 FM radio transmitting stations. Comprehensive service in twenty-one languages is available throughout the world.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nRapid improvements, innovations, and diversification in communications technology, including optical fiber cables, communications satellites, and [[fax]] machines, led to rapid growth of the  communications industry in the 1980s. [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]] Corporation, owned by the government until 1985, had dominated the communications industry until April 1985, when new common carriers, including [[Daini Denden]], were permitted to enter the field. [[NTT Worldwide Telecommunications Corp]] ([[Kokusai Denshin Denwa]] Company, commonly known as KDD, now part of [[KDDI]] Inc.) lost its monopoly hold on international communications activities in 1989, when [[Nihon Kokusai Tsushin]] and other private overseas communications firms began operations.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 1992 Japan also had more than 12,000 televisions stations, and the country had more than 350 radio stations, 300 AM radio stations and 58 FM. Broadcasting innovations in the 1980s included sound multiplex (two-language or stereo) broadcasting, satellite broadcasting, and in 1985 the University of the Air and teletext services were inaugurated.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nJapan has been the world leader in telecommunications in the 1980s, but this position that has been challenged by the [[United States]]' [[dot-com company|dot-com]] industry in the 1990s and the emerging [[Four Asian Tigers|tiger states]] in Asia. While the United States is leading in digital content, [[South Korea]] is leading in broadband access, India is leading in software, and [[Taiwan]] is leading in research and development.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nJapan went into the [[21st century]] after achieving widespread saturation with telecommunication devices.

Japan, as we know it today, is home to one of the world's most developed transport networks.

In the year 2005, the toll collecting companies, formerly [[Japan Highway Public Corporation]], have been transformed into private companies in public ownership, and there are plans to sell parts of them. The aim of this policy is to encourage competition and decrease tolls.\n\nRoad passenger and freight transport expanded considerably during the 1980s as private ownership of motor vehicles greatly increased along with the quality and extent of the nation's roads. Bus companies including the [[JR Bus]] companies operate long-distance bus services on the nation's expanding expressway network. In addition to relatively low fares and deluxe seating, the buses are well utilised because they continue service during the night, when air and train services are limited.\n\nThe cargo sector grew rapidly in the 1980s, recording 274.2 billion [[tonne-kilometre]]s in 1990.  The freight handled by motor vehicles, mainly trucks, in 1990, was over 6 billion tonnes, accounting for 90 percent of domestic freight tonnage and about 50 percent of tonne-kilometres.\n\nRecent large infrastructure projects were the construction of the [[Great Seto Bridge]] and the [[Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line]] (opened 1997).\n\nAlthough road fatalities have been decreasing, due in part to stricter enforcement of [[drunk driving]] laws, 2004 still saw 7,358 deaths on Japanese roads.\n\n{{See also|National highways of Japan|Japan Highway Public Corporation|Expressways of Japan|List of bus operating companies in Japan}}\n\n== Airway  ==\n[[File:Kansai International Airport (1).jpg|thumb|[[Kansai Airport]], [[Osaka]]]]\n\nIn 2013 Japan had the fourth largest passenger air market in the world with 105,913,000 passengers.<ref>World Bank Database, http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.PSGR</ref> In 2013 Japan had 98 airports.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120803140213/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120206x2.html ]</ref> The main international gateways are [[Narita International Airport]] (Tokyo area), [[Kansai International Airport]] (Osaka/Kobe/Kyoto area), and [[Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport]] (Nagoya area).

[[United Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]], formerly [[Northwest Airlines]], are major international operators from Narita Airport.\n\nDomestic air travel in Japan has historically been highly regulated. From 1972, the three major domestic airlines (JAL, ANA, and JAS) were allocated certain routes, with JAL and ANA sharing trunk routes, and ANA and JAS sharing local feeder routes. JAL and JAS have since been merged to help compete with ANA. JAL also had a flag-carrier monopoly on international routes until 1986. Airfares were set by the government until 2000, although carriers had freedom to adjust the standard fares starting in 1995 (when discounts of up to 50% were permitted).

Bush]]]]\n\nThe United States is Japan's closest ally, and Japan relies on the U.S. for [[National security of Japan|its national security]] to a high degree. As two of the world's top three economic powers, both countries also rely on close economic ties for their wealth, despite ongoing and occasionally acrimonious trade frictions.\n\nAlthough [[Constitution of Japan|its constitution]] and [[Government of Japan|government]] policy preclude an offensive military role for Japan in international affairs, Japanese cooperation with the United States through the 1960 [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|U.S.\u2013Japan Security Treaty]] has been important to the peace and stability of [[East Asia]]. Currently, there are domestic discussions about possible reinterpretation of [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]]. All postwar Japanese governments have relied on a close relationship with the United States as the foundation of their foreign policy and have depended on the mutual security treaty for strategic protection.\n\nThe relationship probably hit a post-war nadir around the early 1990s, when Japan's \"economic rise\" was seen as a threat to American power.  Japan was the primary financier of the [[Gulf War]], yet received major criticism in some US circles for its refusal to commit actual military support.  Following the collapse of the so-called [[Bubble economy]] and the 1990s boom in the US, the Japanese economy was perceived as less of a threat to US interests.  Some observers still feel that Japan's willingness to deploy troops in support of current US operations in Iraq, as spearheaded by [[Junichiro Koizumi|Koizumi]] and the conservative [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]], reflects a vow not to be excluded from the group of countries the US considers friends.  This decision may reflect a [[realpolitik]] understanding of the threat Japan faces from a rapidly modernizing [[China]], which from its continued and indeed growing pattern of anti-Japanese [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] reveals the belief that old historical scores remain unsettled.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Uruguay }}||<!--Date started-->1921-09-24\n|See [[Japan\u2013Uruguay relations]]\n* Japan has an embassy in [[Montevideo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uy.emb-japan.go.jp/|title=Bienvenidos a la pagina web de la Embajada del Japon en el Uruguay|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330161034/http://www.uy.emb-japan.go.jp/|archivedate=30 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* Uruguay has an embassy in Tokyo.\n* There are a few hundred people of [[Japanese people|Japanese descent]] living in Uruguay.

He made another two-day trip in 2009, during which he met Prime Minister [[Taro Aso]].\n|}\n\n==Asia==\n===Southeast Asia===\n[[File:Embassy of Indonesia, in Tokyo.jpg|thumb|Embassy of Indonesia in Japan]]\nBy 1990 Japan's interaction with the vast majority of Asia-Pacific countries, especially its burgeoning economic exchanges, was multifaceted and increasingly important to the recipient countries. The developing countries of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) regarded Japan as critical to their development. Japan's aid to the ASEAN countries totaled US $1.9 billion in Japanese fiscal year (FY) 1988 versus about US $333 million for the [[United States]] during U.S. FY 1988. Japan was the number one foreign investor in the ASEAN countries, with cumulative investment as of March 1989 of about US $14.5 billion, more than twice that of the United States. Japan's share of total foreign investment in ASEAN countries in the same period ranged from 70 to 80 percent in [[Thailand]] to 20 percent in [[Indonesia]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Japanese government was making a concerted effort to enhance its diplomatic stature, especially in Asia. [[Toshiki Kaifu]]'s much publicized spring 1991 tour of five Southeast Asian nations\u2014[[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], Thailand, [[Singapore]], and the [[Philippines]]\u2014culminated in a 3 May major foreign policy address in Singapore, in which he called for a new partnership with the ASEAN and pledged that Japan would go beyond the purely economic sphere to seek an \"appropriate role in the political sphere as a nation of peace.\" As evidence of this new role, Japan took an active part in promoting negotiations to resolve the [[Cambodia]]n conflict.\n\nIn 1997, the ASEAN member nations and the People's Republic of China, South Korea and Japan agreed to hold yearly talks to further strengthen regional cooperation, the [[ASEAN Plus Three]] meetings. In 2005 the ASEAN plus Three countries together with [[India]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] held the inaugural [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS).\n\n===South Asia===\nIn [[South Asia]], Japan's role is mainly that of an aid donor. Japan's aid to seven South Asian countries totaled US$1.1 billion in 1988 and 1989, dropping to just under US$900 million in 1990. Except for [[Pakistan]], which received heavy inputs of aid from the United States, all other South Asian countries receive most of their aid from Japan. Four South Asian nations\u2014[[India]], Pakistan, [[Bangladesh]], and [[Sri Lanka]]\u2014are in the top ten list of Tokyo's aid recipients worldwide. A point to note is that Indian Government has a no receive aid policy since the tsunami that struck India but Indian registerred NGOs look to Japan for much investment in their projects\n\nPrime Minister [[Toshiki Kaifu]] signaled a broadening of Japan's interest in South Asia with his swing through the region in April 1990. In an address to the [[Indian parliament]], Kaifu stressed the role of free markets and democracy in bringing about \"a new international order,\" and he emphasized the need for a settlement of the [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir territorial dispute]] between India and Pakistan and for economic liberalization to attract foreign investment and promote dynamic growth. To India, which was very short of hard currency, Kaifu pledged a new concessional loan of \u00a5100 billion (about US$650 million) for the coming year.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\" \n! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\"| Country\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"12%\"| Formal Relations Began\n! scope=\"col\" Notes\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Afghanistan }}||1930-11-19<ref name=\"mfat\" >mfat</ref>||See [[Afghanistan\u2013Japan relations]]\n\nAfghan\u2013Japanese relations have existed as far back as [[World War II]], and have been mainly positive.

After the establishment of the People's Republic of [[China]] (PRC) in 1949, relations with Japan changed from hostility and an absence of contact to cordiality and extremely close cooperation in many fields. During the 1960s the two countries resumed trade for the first time since World War II under the Liao\u2013Takasaki Agreement. On 29 September 1972, Japan and China signed a treaty establishing diplomatic relations between the states. The 1990s led to an enormous growth in China\u2019s economic welfare. Trade between Japan and China was one of the many reasons China was able to grow in the double-digit rates during the 1980s and 1990s. Japan was in the forefront among leading industrialized nations in restoring closer economic and political relations with China. Resumption of Japan's multibillion-dollar investments to China and increased visits to China by Japanese officials, culminating in the October 1992 visit of Emperor [[Akihito]], gave a clear indication that Japan considered closer ties with China in its economic and strategic interest. Despite a 1995 apology regarding World War II by Japanese Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], tensions still remain, mostly because many Chinese feel there is a lack of true remorse for wartime crimes committed by Imperial Japanese forces.  This has been reinforced by numerous visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] by Japanese Prime Ministers, attempts to revise textbooks by Japanese nationalists, the continued dispute over Japan's atrocities in the [[Nanking Massacre]], and the resurgence of nationalism and militarism in Japan.\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|East Timor }}||2002-05-20<ref name=\"mfat\"/>||See [[East Timor\u2013Japan relations]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Georgia }}||<!--Date started-->1992-08-03||See [[Georgia\u2013Japan relations]]\n* Japan has extended [[foreign aid]] to Georgia for various economic and cultural development projects.\n* The balance of trade between the two nations is heavily in favor of Japan, with Japan exporting automobiles and manufactured goods, and Georgia exporting food products and chemicals.\n* Georgian President [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] made an official visit to Japan in March 1999 and President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] visited Japan in March 2007.\n* Since November 2006, Georgia has maintained an embassy in Tokyo.\n* Japan has an embassy in [[Tbilisi]].\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080903230319/http://www.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?sec_id=371&lang_id=ENG Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the relations with Japan]\n*[http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/europe/georgia/index.html Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the relations with Georgia]\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|India }}||1952-04-28<ref name=\"mfat\"/>||See [[India\u2013Japan relations]]\n\n[[File:Trilateral exercise 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Indian Navy|Indian]], Japanese and US naval warships take part in a military exercise near [[B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula]] in 2007.

From Lisbon, the ambassadors left for the [[Holy See|Vatican]] in Rome, which was the main goal of their journey.

After return travel by way of [[New Spain]] and the [[Philippines]], the embassy reached the harbor of [[Nagasaki]] in August 1620. While the embassy was gone, Japan had undergone significant change, starting with the 1614 [[Siege of Osaka|Osaka Rebellion]], leading to a 1616 decree from the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] that all interaction with non-Chinese foreigners was confined to [[Hirado]] and [[Nagasaki]]. In fact, the only western country that was allowed to trade with Japan was the Dutch Republic. This was the beginning of \"[[sakoku]]\", where Japan was essentially closed to the western world until 1854.\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Bratislava, the Japanese Embassy.JPG|thumb|left|Embassy of [[Japan]] in [[Bratislava]], Slovakia.]]\nAlthough cultural and non-economic ties with [[Western Europe]] grew significantly during the 1980s, the economic nexus remained by far the most important element of Japanese \u2013 West European relations throughout the decade. Events in West European relations, as well as political, economic, or even military matters, were topics of concern to most Japanese commentators because of the immediate implications for Japan. The major issues centred on the effect of the coming West European economic unification on Japan's trade, investment, and other opportunities in Western Europe.

During the [[Sakoku]] period (1641\u20131853) there were no relations, but the treaty of 1854 saw the resumption of ties which, despite the hiatus of the Second World War, remain very strong in the present day. Today, the United Kingdom views Japan as its closest ally in the [[Asia Pacific]] region, while Japan views the UK as its closest ally in Europe.\n|}\n\n==Oceania==\n{{See also|Japan\u2013Oceania relations}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Australia }}||1947<ref name=\"mfat\"/>||See [[Australia\u2013Japan relations]]\n[[File:Katsuya Okada Hillary Rodham Clinton and Stephen Smith 20090921.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Katsuya Okada]] (left), [[Hillary Clinton]] (centre) and [[Stephen Smith (Australian politician)|Stephen Smith]] (right)]]\n\n[[Australia]]\u2013Japan relations have generally warm as well as acknowledged mutuality of strong interests, beliefs and friendship, and has since continued to grow strongly over the years. However, memories of [[World War II]] linger among the older members of the Australian public, as does a contemporary fear of Japanese economic domination over countries, particularly Australia, although such fears have fallen off in response to Japan's economic stagnation in the 1990s. At the same time, government and business leaders see Japan as a vital export market and an essential element in Australia's strong future growth and prosperity in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.\n\nAustralia is also a major source of food and raw materials for Japan. In 1990 Australia accounted for 5.3 percent of total Japanese imports, a share that held relatively steady in the late 1980s. Due to its ability to export raw materials, Australia had a trade surplus with Japan. Australia was the largest single supplier of coal, iron ore, wool, and sugar to Japan in 1990. Australia is also a supplier of [[uranium]]. Japanese investment by 1988 made Australia the single largest source of Japanese regional imports. Resource development projects in Australia attracted Japanese capital, as did trade protectionism by necessitating local production for the Australian market. Investments in Australia totaled US$8.1 billion in 1988, accounting for 4.4 percent of Japanese direct investment abroad. \nThere is some tension regarding the issue of whaling.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Cook Islands }}||2011-03-25<ref name=\"mfat\"/>||See [[Foreign relations of Cook Islands]]\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Fiji }}||1970-10-01<ref name=\"mfat\"/>||See [[Foreign relations of Fiji]]\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Kiribati }}||1980-03<ref name=\"mfat\"/>||See [[Foreign relations of Kiribati]]\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Marshall Islands }}||1988-12-09<ref name=\"mfat\"/>||See [[Foreign relations of Marshall Islands]]\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Federated States of Micronesia}}||1988-08-05<ref name=\"mfat\"/>||See [[Foreign relations of Federated States of Micronesia]]\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Nauru }}||1968-01-31<ref name=\"mfat\"/>||See [[Foreign relations of Nauru]]\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|New Zealand}}||1952<ref name=\"mfat\"/>||See [[Japan\u2013New Zealand relations]]\n\nJapan\u2013[[New Zealand]] relations have had generally cordial relations since the post-[[World War II]] period, with Japan being a major trading partner with New Zealand.

Japan\u2019s official stance is that all war-related reparation claims have been resolved (except with North Korea). Unofficial visits to the controversial [[Yasukuni Jinja]] by past Prime Ministers belonging to the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] and the [[Japanese history textbook controversies|exclusion or generalization of some elements of Japan\u2019s military history in a number school textbooks]] have also clouded the issue. In 2004, China and the two Koreas criticized Japan for sending its [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force|Ground Self Defence Forces]] to [[Iraq]], which was seen as signalling a return to [[militarism]]. The government of Japan insisted that its forces would only participate in reconstruction and humanitarian aid missions.\n\nAs a result, there is a strong [[anti-Japanese sentiment]] in China and the two Koreas. Antagonism is not inevitable however. Both Japan and South Korea successfully hosted the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], bridging a physical and political gap between the two countries.

Ray Society, London. p. 16</ref>\n\nHe published important works on [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[natural theology]]. His classification of plants in his ''Historia Plantarum'', was an important step towards modern [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. Ray rejected the system of dichotomous division by which species were classified according to a pre-conceived, either/or type system {{Elucidate|date=June 2016}}, and instead classified plants according to similarities and differences that emerged from observation. He was the first to give a biological definition of the term ''[[species]]''.<ref>''Historia plantarum generalis'', in the volume published in 1686, Tome I, Libr. I, Chap.

He is said to have been born in the smithy, his father having been the village [[blacksmith]]. He was sent at the age of sixteen to Cambridge University: studying at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]].<ref>{{acad|id=RY644J|name=Ray, John}}</ref> His tutor at Trinity was [[James Duport]], and his intimate friend and fellow-pupil the celebrated [[Isaac Barrow]]. Ray was chosen minor fellow{{efn|While still a B.A.}} of Trinity in 1649, and later major fellow.{{efn|On attaining his M.A.}} He held many college offices, becoming successively lecturer in Greek (1651), mathematics (1653), and humanity (1655), ''[[praelector]]'' (1657), frias (1657), and college steward (1659 and 1660); and according to the habit of the time, he was accustomed to preach in his college chapel and also at [[St Mary the Great with St Michael, Cambridge|Great St Mary's]], long before he took [[holy order]]s on 23 December 1660. Among these sermons were his discourses on ''The wisdom of God manifested in the works of the creation'',<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dxkHAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover ''The wisdom of God manifested in the works of the Creation''], Google Books</ref> and ''Deluge and Dissolution of the World''. Ray was also highly regarded as a tutor and he communicated his own passion for natural history to several pupils. It has been generally asserted that Willughby was Ray's pupil at Cambridge, but what little evidence exists on the matter is rather against this supposition. <ref>{{cite journal|author=Mullens, W.H. |title=Some early British Ornithologists and their works.

Finally, in 1679, he removed to his birthplace at [[Black Notley]], where he afterwards remained. His life there was quiet and uneventful, although he had poor health, including chronic sores. Ray kept writing books and corresponded widely on scientific matters. He lived, in spite of his infirmities, to the age of seventy-seven, dying at Black Notley. He is buried in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul where there is a memorial to him.\n\n[[File:Memorial to John Ray in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul in Black Notley.jpg|thumb|Memorial to John Ray in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul in Black Notley]]\n[[File:Close-up of John Ray memorial.jpg|thumb|Close-up of memorial to John Ray]]\n\n== Work ==\n[[File:John Ray woodcut.jpg|thumb|right|Woodcut (1693)]]\nAt Cambridge, Ray spent much of his time in the study of [[natural history]], a subject which would occupy him for most of his life.{{sfn|Vines|1913}} When Ray found himself unable to subscribe as required by the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|\u2018Bartholomew Act\u2019 of 1662]] he, along with 13 other college fellows, resigned his fellowship on 24 August 1662<!--not in source: the year after [[Isaac Newton]] had entered the college--> rather than swear to the declaration that the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] was not binding on those who had taken it.<ref name=\"DNB00\">[[wikisource:Ray, John (DNB00)]]</ref> [[Tobias Smollett]] quoted the reasoning given in the biography of Ray by [[William Derham]]:\n<blockquote>\"The reason of his refusal was not (says his biographer) as some have imagined, his having taken the solemn league and covenant; for that he never did, and often declared that he ever thought it an unlawful oath: but he said he could not say, for those that had taken the oath, that no obligation lay upon them, but feared there might.\"<ref>[[Tobias Smollett|Tobias George Smollett]] (1761) ''The Critical review, or, Annals of literature'', Volume 11 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoRHAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93 pp. 92\u201393]</ref></blockquote>\nHis religious views were generally in accord with [[Clarendon Code|those imposed]] under the restoration of [[Charles II of England]], and (though technically a [[Nonconformism|nonconformist]]) he continued as a layman in the [[Established church|Established]] [[Church of England]].<ref name=\"DNB00\" />\n\nFrom this time onwards he seems to have depended chiefly on the bounty of his pupil [[Francis Willughby]], who made Ray his constant companion while he lived. Willughby arranged that after his death, Ray would have 6 shillings a year for educating Willughby's two sons.\n\nIn the spring of 1663 Ray started together with Willughby and two other pupils ([[Philip Skippon (1641-1691)|Philip Skippon]] and [[Nathaniel Bacon (colonist)|Nathaniel Bacon]]<ref name=gribbin2002>{{cite book | author=Gribbin, John | authorlink=John Gribbin | title=Science, a History, 1543-2001 | publisher=Allen Lane | location=New York | year=2002}}</ref>) on a tour through [[Europe]], from which he returned in March 1666, parting from Willughby at [[Montpellier]], whence the latter continued his journey into [[Spain]]. He had previously in three different journeys (1658, 1661, 1662) travelled through the greater part of Great Britain, and selections from his private notes of these journeys were edited by [[George Lewis Scott|George Scott]]<!--Fellow of Society of Antiquaries--> in 1760, under the title of ''Mr Ray's Itineraries''. Ray himself published an account of his foreign travel in 1673, entitled ''Observations topographical, moral, and physiological, made on a Journey through part of the Low Countries, Germany, Italy, and France''. From this tour Ray and Willughby returned laden with collections, on which they meant to base complete systematic descriptions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Willughby undertook the former part, but, dying in 1672, left only an ornithology and ichthyology for Ray to edit; while Ray used the botanical collections for the groundwork of his ''Methodus plantarum nova'' (1682), and his great ''Historia generalis plantarum'' (3 vols., 1686, 1688, 1704). The plants gathered on his British tours had already been described in his ''Catalogus plantarum Angliae'' (1670), which formed the basis for later English floras.\n\nIn 1667 Ray was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], and in 1669 he and Willughby published a paper on ''Experiments concerning the Motion of Sap in Trees''. In 1671, he presented the research of Francis Jessop on [[formic acid]] to the Royal Society.{{sfn|Raven|1950}}\n\nIn the 1690s, he published three volumes on religion\u2014the most popular being ''The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation'' (1691), an essay describing evidence that all in nature and space is God's creation as in Bible is affirmed. In this volume, he moved on from the naming and cataloguing of species like his successor [[Carl Linnaeus]]. Instead, Ray considered species' lives and how nature worked as a whole, giving facts that are arguments for God's will expressed in His creation of all 'visible and invisible' ([[Colossians]] 1:16).\nRay gave an early description of [[dendrochronology]], explaining for the [[Ash (tree)|ash tree]] how to find its age from its tree-rings.<ref>Armstrong, 2000. p. 47</ref>\n\n=== Ray's definition of species ===\n\nRay was the first person to produce a biological definition of [[species]], in his 1686 ''History of Plants'':\n\n:\"... no surer criterion for determining species has occurred to me than the distinguishing features that perpetuate themselves in propagation from seed. Thus, no matter what variations occur in the individuals or the species, if they spring from the seed of one and the same plant, they are accidental variations and not such as to distinguish a species... Animals likewise that differ specifically preserve their distinct species permanently; one species never springs from the seed of another nor vice versa\".<ref>Mayr ''Growth of biological thought'' p256; original was Ray, ''History of Plants''. 1686, trans E. Silk.</ref>\n\n=== System of classification ===\nAs outlined in his ''Historia Plantarum'' (1685\u20131703):{{sfn|Singh|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=z6fMBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA302 John Ray p.&nbsp;302]}}\n* Herbae ([[Herbaceous plants]])\n** Imperfectae ([[Cryptogams]])\n** Perfectae ([[Seed plants]])\n*** [[Monocotyledons]]\n*** [[Dicotyledons]]\n* Arborae ([[Trees]])\n** Monocotyledons\n** Dicotyledons\n\n=== Publications ===\n\nRay published about 23 works, depending on how they are counted.

Ellmann (1982) p. 21.</ref> Aloysius Joyce''' (2 February 1882 \u2013 13 January 1941) was an Irish novelist, short story writer, and poet. He contributed to the [[Modernism|modernist]] [[avant-garde]] and is regarded as one of the most influential and important authors of the 20th century. Joyce is best known for ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, most famously [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]. Other well-known works are the short-story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914), and the novels ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1916) and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, his published letters and occasional journalism.\n\nJoyce was born in 41 Brighton Square, [[Rathgar]], [[Dublin]], into a middle-class family. A brilliant student, he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run [[O'Connell School]] before excelling at the Jesuit schools [[Clongowes Wood College|Clongowes]] and [[Belvedere College|Belvedere]], despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father's alcoholism and unpredictable finances. He went on to attend [[University College Dublin]].\n\nIn 1904, in his early twenties, Joyce emigrated to continental Europe with his partner (and later wife) [[Nora Barnacle]]. They lived in [[Trieste]], [[Paris]], and [[Zurich]]. Although most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe centres on Dublin, and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. ''Ulysses'' in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of ''Ulysses'', he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, \"For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal.\"<ref>Ellman, p. 505, citing Power, ''From an Old Waterford House'' (London, n.d.), pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:James Joyce birth and baptismal certificate.jpg|thumb|Joyce's birth and baptismal certificate]]\nOn 2 February 1882, Joyce was born in [[Rathgar]], [[Dublin]], Ireland. Joyce's father was [[John Stanislaus Joyce]] and his mother was Mary Jane \"May\" Murray. He was the eldest of ten surviving siblings; two died of [[typhoid]]. James was baptised according to the Rites of the [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic Church]] in the nearby St Joseph's Church in [[Terenure]] on 5 February 1882 by Rev. John O'Mulloy. Joyce's godparents were Philip and Ellen McCann.\n\nJohn Stanislaus Joyce's family came from [[Fermoy]] in [[County Cork]], and had owned a small salt and lime works. Joyce's paternal grandfather, James Augustine Joyce, married Ellen O'Connell, daughter of John O'Connell, a Cork Alderman who owned a drapery business and other properties in Cork City. Ellen's family claimed kinship with [[Daniel O'Connell]], \"The Liberator\".<ref>Jackson, John Wyse; Costello, Peter (July 1998). \"John Stanislaus Joyce: the voluminous life and genius of James Joyce's father\"</ref> The Joyce family's purported ancestor, [[Se\u00e1n M\u00f3r Seoighe]] (fl. 1680) was a stonemason from [[Connemara]].<ref name=\"seoige\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/j/jackson-joyce.html |title=John Stanislaus Joyce: the voluminous life and genius of James Joyce's father |last=Jackson |first=John Wyse |authorlink= |last2=Costello |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Costello (author) |date=July 1998 |work=excerpt appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |at=ch.1 \"Ancestral Joyces\" |format=book excerpt |isbn=9780312185992 |oclc=38354272 |accessdate=25 September 2012 |quote=To find the missing link in the chain it is necessary to turn south to County Kerry.

Around this time Joyce was attacked by a dog, leading to his lifelong [[cynophobia]]. He suffered from [[astraphobia]]; a superstitious aunt had described thunderstorms as a sign of God's wrath.<ref>\"'Why are you so afraid of thunder?' asked [Arthur] Power, 'your children don't mind it.' 'Ah,' said Joyce contemptuously, 'they have no religion.' Joyce's fears were part of his identity, and he had no wish, even if he had had the power, to slough any of them off.\" (Ellmann (1982), p. 514, citing Power, ''From an Old Waterford House''  (London, n.d.), p. 71</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Joyce wrote a poem on the death of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]. His father was angry at the treatment of Parnell by the Catholic Church, the [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Home Rule Party]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|British Liberal Party]] and the resulting collaborative failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The Irish Party had dropped Parnell from leadership. But the Vatican's role in allying with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] to prevent Home Rule left a lasting impression on the young Joyce.<ref>In Search of Ireland's Heroes: [[Carmel McCaffrey]] pp 279\u2013286</ref> The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the [[Vatican Library]]. In November, John Joyce was entered in ''[[Stubbs' Gazette]]'' (a publisher of bankruptcies) and suspended from work. In 1893, John Joyce was dismissed with a pension, beginning the family's slide into poverty caused mainly by his drinking and financial mismanagement.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 32\u201334.</ref>\n\nJoyce had begun his education at [[Clongowes Wood College]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] boarding school near [[Clane]], County Kildare, in 1888 but had to leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] [[O'Connell School]] on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered a place in the Jesuits' Dublin school, [[Belvedere College]], in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere.<ref>James Joyce: Richard Ellmann 1982 PP 54\u201355</ref> In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the [[Sodality of Our Lady]] by his peers at Belvedere.<ref>[http://www.themodernword.com/joyce/joyce_chronology.html Themodernworld.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622062917/http://www.themodernword.com/Joyce/joyce_chronology.html |date=22 June 2011 }}</ref> The philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]] continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 60, 190, 340, 342; Cf.

He became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city. In 1900 his laudatory review of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'' was published in ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]''; it was his first publication and, after learning basic Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen, he received a letter of thanks from the dramatist. Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at University College Dublin appeared as characters in Joyce's works. His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation, most notably, [[Tom Kettle]], [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]] and [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]]. Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by [[Arthur Griffith]] in his newspaper, ''[[United Irishman]]'', in November 1901. Joyce had written an article on the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] and his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce had it printed and distributed locally. Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce.<ref>Jordan, Anthony, [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0220/1224312050318.html \"An Irishman's Diary\"], ''Irish Times'', 20 February 2012</ref><ref>Arthur Griffith with James Joyce & WB Yeats- Liberating Ireland by Anthony J.

Richard Ellmann suggests that this may have been because he found the technical lectures in French too difficult. Joyce had already failed to pass chemistry in English in Dublin. But Joyce claimed ill health as the problem and wrote home that he was unwell and complained about the cold weather.<ref>Richard Ellmann: James Joyce (1959) pp 117\u2013118</ref> He stayed on for a few months, appealing for finance his family could ill afford and reading late in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]].

He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called ''Stephen Hero''. It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man''. The unfinished ''Stephen Hero'' was published after his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesjoyce.ie/detail.asp?ID=28 |title=Joyce \u2013 Other works |publisher=The James Joyce Centre |accessdate=22 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624115127/http://www.jamesjoyce.ie/detail.asp?ID=28 |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1904 he met [[Nora Barnacle]], a young woman from [[Galway|Galway city]] who was working as a chambermaid.

It later came to fact that the agent had been swindled; the director of the school sent Joyce on to [[Trieste]], which was then part of [[Austria-Hungary]] (until the First World War), and is today part of Italy. Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz School, he finally secured a teaching position in [[Pula|Pola]], then also part of Austria-Hungary (today part of [[Croatia]]). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians\u2014having discovered an espionage ring in the city\u2014expelled all [[Alien (law)|aliens]]. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there. He remained in Trieste for most of the next ten years.<ref name=\"mccourt\">McCourt 2001.</ref>\n\nLater that year Nora gave birth to their first child, George (known as Giorgio). Joyce persuaded his brother, Stanislaus, to join him in Trieste, and secured a teaching position for him at the school. Joyce sought to augment his family's meagre income with his brother's earnings.<ref>According to Ellmann, Stanislaus allowed Joyce to collect his pay, \"to simplify matters\" (p. 213).</ref> Stanislaus and Joyce had strained relations while they lived together in Trieste, arguing about Joyce's drinking habits and frivolity with money.<ref>The worst of the conflicts were during July 1910 (Ellmann (1982), pp. 311\u201313).</ref>\n\nJoyce became frustrated with life in Trieste and moved to Rome in late 1906, taking employment as a clerk in a bank. He disliked Rome and returned to Trieste in early 1907. His daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]] was born later that year.<ref>Williams, Bob.

He visited Nora's family in [[Galway]] and liked Nora's mother very much.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beja|first1=Morris|title=James Joyce: A Literary Life|date=1992|publisher=Ohio State University Press|location=Columbus, Ohio|isbn=978-0-8142-0599-0|page=54}}</ref> While preparing to return to Trieste he decided to take one of his sisters, Eva, back with him to help Nora run the home. He spent a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time as a representative of some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste. With their backing he launched Ireland's first cinema, the [[Volta Cinematograph]], which was well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 300\u201303, 308, 311.</ref> Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent the rest of her life on the continent, eventually marrying the [[Czech people|Czech]] bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 384\u201385.</ref>\n\nJoyce returned to Dublin again briefly in mid-1912 during his years-long fight with Dublin publisher George Roberts over the publication of ''Dubliners''. His trip was once again fruitless, and on his return he wrote the poem \"Gas from a Burner\", an invective against Roberts. After this trip, he never again came closer to Dublin than London, despite many pleas from his father and invitations from his fellow Irish writer [[William Butler Yeats]].\n\nOne of his students in Trieste was Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym [[Italo Svevo]]. They met in 1907 and became lasting friends and mutual critics. Schmitz was a Catholic of Jewish origin and became a primary model for Leopold Bloom; most of the details about the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] in ''Ulysses'' came from Schmitz's responses to queries from Joyce.<ref>Ellmann (1982), p. 272.</ref> While living in Trieste, Joyce was first beset with eye problems that ultimately required over a dozen surgical operations.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 268, 417.</ref>\n\nJoyce concocted a number of money-making schemes during this period, including an attempt to become a cinema [[Business magnate|magnate]] in Dublin. He frequently discussed but ultimately abandoned a plan to import Irish tweed to Trieste. Correspondence relating to that venture with the Irish Woollen Mills were for a long time displayed in the windows of their premises in [[Dublin]]. Joyce's skill at borrowing money saved him from indigence. What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students.\n\nIn 1915, after most of his students in Trieste were conscripted to fight in the First World War, Joyce moved to [[Zurich]]. Two influential private students, Baron Ambrogio Ralli and Count Francesco Sordina, petitioned officials for an exit permit for the Joyces, who in turn agreed not to take any action against the emperor of Austria-Hungary during the war.<ref>Ellman (1982), p. 386.</ref>\n\n===1920\u201341: Paris and Zurich===\n[[File:Jamesjoyce tuohy-ohne.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Half-length portrait of a fortyish man wearing distinctive Windsor (circular-lens) glasses with black Zylo-covered frames, short and slicked-down brown hair, a small mustache, light tan jacket and brown tie.

Portrait by [[Patrick Tuohy]].]]\n\nJoyce set himself to finishing ''Ulysses'' in Paris, delighted to find that he was gradually gaining fame as an avant-garde writer. A further grant from [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]] meant he could devote himself full-time to writing again, as well as consort with other literary figures in the city. During this time, Joyce's eyes began to give him more and more problems and he often wore an [[eyepatch]]. He was treated by Louis Borsch in Paris, undergoing nine operations before Borsch's death in 1929.<ref>Ellmann (1982) pp. 566\u201374.</ref> Throughout the 1930s he travelled frequently to Switzerland for eye surgeries and for treatments for his daughter Lucia, who, according to the Joyces, suffered from [[schizophrenia]]. Lucia was analysed by [[Carl Jung]] at the time, who after reading ''Ulysses'' is said to have concluded that her father had schizophrenia.<ref>Shloss, p. 278.</ref> Jung said that she and her father were two people heading to the bottom of a river, except that Joyce was diving and Lucia was sinking.<ref>Pepper, Tara</ref><ref>Shloss p. 297.</ref><ref>The literary executor of the Joyce estate, [[Stephen J.

Retrieved 9 July 2007). Stephen Joyce stated in a letter to the editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' that \"Regarding the destroyed correspondence, these were all personal letters from Lucia to us. They were written many years after both Nonno and Nonna [i.e. Mr and Mrs Joyce] died and did not refer to them. Also destroyed were some postcards and one telegram from [[Samuel Beckett]] to Lucia.

Were it not for their support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's constant financial support), there is a good possibility that his books might never have been finished or published. In their literary magazine ''[[Transition (literary journal)|transition]]'', the Jolases published serially various sections of ''Finnegans Wake'' under the title ''Work in Progress''. Joyce returned to Zurich in late 1940, fleeing the [[German occupation of France during World War II|Nazi occupation of France]].\n\n===Joyce and religion===\nThe issue of Joyce's relationship with religion is somewhat controversial. Early in life, he lapsed from Catholicism, according to first-hand testimonies coming from himself, his brother Stanislaus Joyce, and his wife:\n\n<blockquote>My mind rejects the whole present social order and Christianity\u2014home, the recognised virtues, classes of life and religious doctrines. [...] Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it impossible for me to remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride. Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.<ref>Letter to Nora Barnacle. 29 August 1904. In ''Selected Letters of James Joyce''. Richard Ellmann, ed.

The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in ''Dubliners'' later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel ''Ulysses''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~mgroden/notes/charsfromdub.html |title=Notes on James Joyce's Ulysses |author=Michael Groden |publisher=[[The University of Western Ontario]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101010343/http://publish.uwo.ca/~mgroden/notes/charsfromdub.html |archivedate=1 November 2005 |df= }}</ref> The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.\n\n===''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man''===\n{{Main|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man}}\n''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' is a nearly complete rewrite of the abandoned novel ''[[Stephen Hero]]''. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript in a fit of rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A ''[[K\u00fcnstlerroman]]'', ''Portrait'' is a heavily autobiographical<ref>MacBride, p. 14.</ref> [[bildungsroman|coming-of-age novel]] depicting the childhood and adolescence of the protagonist [[Stephen Dedalus]] and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]], [[interior monologue]], and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.<ref>Deming, p. 749.</ref>\n\n===''Exiles'' and poetry===\n{{Main|Pomes Penyeach|Chamber Music (poetry collection)}}\n\nDespite early interest in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, ''[[Exiles (play)|Exiles]]'', begun shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband and wife relationship, the play looks back to ''The Dead'' (the final story in ''Dubliners'') and forward to ''Ulysses'', which Joyce began around the time of the play's composition.\n\nJoyce published a number of books of poetry. His first mature published work was the satirical broadside \"The Holy Office\" (1904), in which he proclaimed himself to be the superior of many prominent members of the [[Celtic Revival]]. His first full-length poetry collection ''[[Chamber Music (poetry collection)|Chamber Music]]'' (1907; referring, Joyce joked, to the sound of urine hitting the side of a chamber pot) consisted of 36 short lyrics. This publication led to his inclusion in the ''[[Imagism|Imagist Anthology]]'', edited by [[Ezra Pound]], who was a champion of Joyce's work. Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime include \"Gas From A Burner\" (1912), ''Pomes Penyeach'' (1927), and \"Ecce Puer\" (written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father). It was published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in ''Collected Poems'' (1936).\n\n===''Ulysses''===\n{{Main|Ulysses (novel)}}\n[[File:Order form for ulysses.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Page saying 'ULYSSES by JAMES JOYCE will be published in the Autumn of 1921 by \"SHAKESPEARE AND COMPANY\" \u2013 SYLVIA BEACH \u2013 8, RUE DUPUYTREN, PARIS \u2013 VIe'|Announcement of the initial publication of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.]]\nAs he was completing work on ''Dubliners'' in 1906, Joyce considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called [[Leopold Bloom]] under the title ''Ulysses''. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922).\n\nThanks to Ezra Pound, serial publication of the novel in the magazine ''[[The Little Review]]'' began in March 1918. This magazine was edited by [[Margaret C. Anderson]] and [[Jane Heap]], with the intermittent financial backing of [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], a successful New York commercial lawyer with an interest in contemporary experimental art and literature. Unfortunately, this publication encountered problems with [[United States Postal Service|New York Postal Authorities]]; serialisation ground to a halt in December 1920; the editors were convicted of publishing obscenity in February 1921.<ref>[[Obscenity trial of Ulysses in The Little Review]]; Gillers, pp. 251\u201362.</ref> Although the conviction was based on the \"Nausica\u00e4\" episode of ''Ulysses'', ''The Little Review'' had fuelled the fires of controversy with [[dada]] poet [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]'s defence of ''Ulysses'' in an essay \"The Modest Woman.\"<ref>[[Irene Gammel|Gammel, Irene]]. ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity''.

An English edition published the same year by Joyce's patron, [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]], ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities, and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed. The following year, [[John Rodker]] produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies, but these were burned by English customs at [[Folkestone]]. A further consequence of the novel's ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of \"bootleg\" versions appeared, most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher [[Samuel Roth]]. In 1928, a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication.\n\nWith the appearance of both ''Ulysses'' and [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem, ''[[The Waste Land]]'', 1922 was a key year in the history of English-language literary modernism. In ''Ulysses'', Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and virtually every other literary technique to present his characters.<ref>Examined at length in [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''Lectures on Ulysses. A Facsimile of the Manuscript.'' Bloomfield Hills/Columbia: Bruccoli Clark, 1980.</ref> The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the [[Odyssey]] of [[Homer]] in modern Dublin and represents [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses), [[Penelope]] and [[Telemachus]] in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife [[Molly Bloom]] and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model.<ref>Adams, David. ''Colonial Odysseys: Empire and Epic in the Modernist Novel''. Cornell University Press, 2003, p. 84.</ref> In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of [[Thom's Directory]]\u2014a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.\n\nThe book consists of 18 chapters, each covering roughly one hour of the day, beginning around about 8&nbsp;a.m. and ending sometime after 2&nbsp;a.m. the following morning. Each of the 18 chapters of the novel employs its own literary style. Each chapter also refers to a specific episode in Homer's Odyssey and has a specific colour, art or science and bodily organ associated with it. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal, schematic structure represents one of the book's major contributions to the development of 20th century modernist literature.<ref>Sherry, Vincent B. ''James Joyce: Ulysses''. Cambridge University\nPress, 2004, p. 102.</ref> The use of [[classical mythology]] as a framework for his book and the near-obsessive focus on external detail in a book in which much of the significant action is happening inside the minds of the characters are others. Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, \"I may have oversystematised ''Ulysses'',\" and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer.<ref>Dettmar, Kevin J. H. ''Rereading the New: A Backward Glance at Modernism''. University of Michigan Press, 1992, p. 285.</ref> Joyce was reluctant to publish the chapter titles because he wanted his work to stand separately from the Greek form.  It was only when [[Stuart Gilbert]] published his critical work on ''Ulysses'' in 1930 that the schema was supplied by Joyce to Gilbert. But as Terrence Killeen points out this schema was developed after the novel had been written and was not something that Joyce consulted as he wrote the novel.<ref name=\"Ulysses Unbound: Terence Killeen\">Ulysses Unbound: Terence Killeen</ref>\n\n===''Finnegans Wake''===\n{{Main|Finnegans Wake}}\n[[File:CBI - SERIES C - TEN POUND NOTE.PNG|right|frame|alt=Front and back of a specimen \u00a310 note.

''The Cambridge Introduction to James Joyce''. Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 14.</ref> On 10 March 1923 he informed a patron, Harriet Weaver: \"Yesterday I wrote two pages\u2014the first I have since the final ''Yes'' of ''Ulysses''. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of foolscap so that I could read them. ''Il lupo perde il pelo ma non il vizio'', the Italians say. 'The wolf may lose his skin but not his vice' or 'the leopard cannot change his spots.'\"<ref>Joyce, James. ''Ulysses: The 1922 Text''. Oxford University Press, 1998, p. xlvii.</ref> Thus was born a text that became known, first, as ''Work in Progress'' and later ''Finnegans Wake''.\n\nBy 1926 Joyce had completed the first two parts of the book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine ''transition''. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including the death of his father in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]], and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including [[Samuel Beckett]]. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]] to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 591\u2013592.</ref>\n\nReaction to the work was mixed, including negative comment from early supporters of Joyce's work, such as Pound and the author's brother, Stanislaus Joyce.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 577\u201385.</ref> To counteract this hostile reception, a book of essays by supporters of the new work, including Beckett, [[William Carlos Williams]] and others was organised and published in 1929 under the title ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]''. At his 57th birthday party at the Jolases' home, Joyce revealed the final title of the work and ''Finnegans Wake'' was published in book form on 4 May 1939. Later, further negative comments surfaced from doctor and author [[Hervey M. Cleckley|Hervey Cleckley]], who questioned the significance others had placed on the work. In his book, ''[[The Mask of Sanity]]'', Cleckley refers to ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as \"a 628-page collection of erudite gibberish indistinguishable to most people from the familiar word salad produced by hebephrenic patients on the back wards of any state hospital.\"<ref>Cleckley, Hervey (1982). The Mask of Sanity. Revised Edition. Mosby Medical Library. {{ISBN|0-452-25341-1}}.</ref>\n\nJoyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in ''Finnegans Wake'', which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns. This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than that used by [[Lewis Carroll]] in ''[[Jabberwocky]]''. This has led many readers and critics to apply Joyce's oft-quoted description in the ''Wake'' of ''Ulysses'' as his \"usylessly unreadable Blue Book of Eccles\"<ref>''Finnegans Wake'', 179.26\u201327.</ref> to the ''Wake'' itself. However, readers have been able to reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot.\n\nMuch of the wordplay in the book stems from the use of multilingual puns which draw on a wide range of languages. The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and, as Joyce's eyesight worsened, of writing the text from the author's dictation.<ref>Gluck, p. 27.</ref>\n\nThe view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by [[Giambattista Vico]], and the metaphysics of [[Giordano Bruno]] of [[Nola]] are important to the interplay of the \"characters.\" Vico propounded a cyclical view of history, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing words of the book. ''Finnegans Wake'' opens with the words \"riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.\" (\"vicus\" is a pun on Vico) and ends \"A way a lone a last a loved a long the.\" In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle.<ref>{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Shockley |editor1-first=Alan W. |editor1-last=Friedman |editor2-first=Charles |editor2-last=Rossman |title=De-Familiarizing Readings: Essays from the Austin Joyce Conference |publisher=Editions Rodopi |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-90-420-2570-7 |series=European Joyce Studies |volume=18 |year=2009 |page=104 |chapter=Playing the Square Circle: Musical Form and Polyphony in the ''Wake'' |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=lW96fbBNRYsC&pg=PA104 }}</ref> Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the ''Wake'' would suffer from \"ideal insomnia\"<ref>''Finnegans Wake'', 120.9\u201316.</ref> and, on completing the book, would turn to page one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Joyce oconnell dublin.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=Bronze statue of Joyce standing in a coat and broadbrimmed hat.

Nabokov put ''Ulysses'' at the head of his list of the \"greatest twentieth century masterpieces\" (Nabokov, ''Strong Opinions'' [New York: McGraw-Hill, 1974] [http://www.nyt.net/books/97/03/02/lifetimes/nab-v-freud.html excerpt]).</ref> while ''Finnegans Wake'' was horrible.<ref>\"Of course, it would have been unseemly for a monarch to appear in the robes of learning at a university lectern and present to rosy youths ''Finnigan's Wake'' {{sic}} as a monstrous extension of [[Striking and Picturesque Delineations|Angus MacDiarmid]]'s \"incoherent transactions\" and of [[Robert Southey|Southey]]'s Lingo-Grande ...\" (Nabokov, ''Pale Fire'' [New York: Random House, 1962], p. 76).

It is generally categorized as a [[gendai bud\u014d|modern]] [[Japanese martial art|martial art]] which later evolved into a [[combat sport|combat]] and [[Olympic sports|Olympic]] sport. Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either [[Throw (grappling)|throw]] or [[Takedown (grappling)|takedown]] an opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a [[Pinning hold|pin]], or force an opponent to submit with a [[joint lock]] or a [[Chokehold|choke]]. [[Strike (attack)|Strikes]] and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defenses are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms ([[kata]], \u5f62) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice ([[randori]], \u4e71\u53d6\u308a). A judo practitioner is called a '''judoka'''.\n\nThe philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from {{nihongo3|''[[kory\u016b]]''|\u53e4\u6d41||traditional schools}}.\n\n== History and philosophy ==\n\n=== Early life of the founder ===\n[[File:Kano Jigoro.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jigoro Kano]]]]\n\nThe early history of judo is inseparable from its founder, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[polymath]] and educator {{nihongo3|Jigoro Kano|\u5609\u7d0d \u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce|[[Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d]]|1860\u20131938}}, born {{nihongo3|Jigor\u014d Shinnosuke|\u65b0\u4e4b\u52a9 \u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce|Shinnosuke Jigor\u014d}}. Kano was born into a relatively affluent family. His father, Jirosaku, was the second son of the head priest of the [[Shinto]] [[Hiyoshi Shrine|Hiyoshi shrine]] in [[Shiga Prefecture]]. He married Sadako Kano, daughter of the owner of Kiku-Masamune sake brewing company and was adopted by the family, changing his name to Kano. He ultimately became an official in the [[Bakufu#Shogunate|Shogunal]] government.<ref>Kano (2008) pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nJigoro Kano had an academic upbringing and, from the age of seven, he studied English, {{nihongo3|[[Japanese calligraphy]]|\u66f8\u9053|shod\u014d}} and the {{nihongo|[[Four Books#Four Books|Four Confucian Texts]]|\u56db\u66f8|Shisho}} under a number of tutors.<ref name=\"Kano 2008, p. 1; Hoare 2009, p. 43\">Kano (2008) p. 1; Hoare (2009) p. 43</ref> When he was fourteen, Kano began boarding at an English-medium school, Ikuei-Gijuku in [[Shiba, Tokyo]]. The culture of bullying endemic at this school was the catalyst that caused Kano to seek out a {{nihongo3|[[Jujutsu]]|\u67d4\u8853|J\u016bjutsu}} {{nihongo3|[[dojo]]|\u9053\u5834|d\u014dj\u014d|training place}} at which to train.<ref name=\"Kano 2008, p. 1; Hoare 2009, p. 43\"/>\n\nEarly attempts to find a jujutsu teacher who was willing to take him on met with little success. With the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, jujutsu had become unfashionable in an increasingly westernised Japan. Many of those who had once taught the art had been forced out of teaching or become so disillusioned with it that they had simply given up. Nakai Umenari, an acquaintance of Kan\u014d's father and a former soldier, agreed to show him ''kata'', but not to teach him. The caretaker of Jirosaku's second house, Katagiri Ryuji, also knew jujutsu, but would not teach it as he believed it was no longer of practical use. Another frequent visitor, Imai Genshiro of {{nihongo3|''[[Kyushin Ryu|Ky\u016bshin-ry\u016b]]''|\u6271\u5fc3\u6d41}} school of jujutsu, also refused.<ref name=\"Kano (2008) p. 2\">Kano (2008) p. 2</ref> Several years passed before he finally found a willing teacher.<ref name=\"Kano (2008) p. 2\"/>\n\nIn 1877, as a student at the Tokyo-''Kaisei'' school (soon to become part of the newly founded [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]]), Kano learned that many jujutsu teachers had been forced to pursue alternative careers, frequently opening {{nihongo3|''Seikotsu-in''|\u6574\u9aa8\u9662||traditional osteopathy practices}}.<ref>Hoare (2009) p. 44</ref> After inquiring at a number of these, Kano was referred to Fukuda Hachinosuke (c.1828\u20131880),<ref>Fukuda (2004) p. 145</ref> a teacher of the {{nihongo3|''[[Tenjin Shinyo-ryu|Tenjin Shin'y\u014d-ry\u016b]]''|\u5929\u795e\u771f\u694a\u6d41}} of jujutsu, who had a small nine mat dojo where he taught five students.<ref>Kano (2008) pp. 3\u20134; Hoare (2009) pp. 45\u201347; Fukuda (2004) pp. 145\u2013152. Keiko Fukuda 9th Dan (born 1913) is the granddaughter of Fukuda Hachinosuke, and is the last surviving direct student of Kano: {{citation\n |last        = Davis\n |first       = Simon\n |title       = Be Strong, Be Gentle, Be Beautiful - Keiko Fukuda\n |url         = http://www.usjf.com/2011/01/be-strong-be-gentle-be-beautiful/\n |work        = United States Judo Federation\n |accessdate  = March 12, 2011\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110308231204/http://www.usjf.com/2011/01/be-strong-be-gentle-be-beautiful/\n |archivedate = March 8, 2011\n |df          = \n}}</ref> Fukuda is said to have emphasized technique over formal exercise, sowing the seeds of Kano's emphasis on {{nihongo3|[[randori]]|\u4e71\u53d6\u308a|randori|free practice}} in judo.\n\nOn Fukuda's death in 1880, Kano, who had become his keenest and most able student in both ''randori'' and {{nihongo3|[[kata (martial arts)|kata]]|\u5f62|kata|pre-arranged forms}}, was given the {{nihongo3|''densho''|\u4f1d\u66f8||scrolls}} of the Fukuda dojo.<ref>Kano (2008) p. 6; Hoare (2009) p. 47</ref> Kano chose to continue his studies at another ''Tenjin Shin'y\u014d-ry\u016b'' school, that of Iso Masatomo (c.1820\u20131881). Iso placed more emphasis on the practice of \"kata\", and entrusted ''randori'' instruction to assistants, increasingly to Kano.<ref>Kano (2008) pp. 9\u201310</ref> Iso died in June 1881 and Kano went on to study at the dojo of Iikubo Tsunetoshi (1835\u20131889) of {{nihongo3|''[[Kito-ry\u016b|Kit\u014d-ry\u016b]]''|\u8d77\u5012\u6d41}}.<ref>Kano (2008) p. 11</ref> Like Fukuda, Iikubo placed much emphasis on ''randori'', with ''Kit\u014d-ry\u016b'' having a greater focus on {{nihongo3|''nage-waza''|\u6295\u3052\u6280||throwing techniques}}.<ref>Kano (2005) p. 23</ref>\n\n=== Founding of the Kodokan ===\n[[File:Eishoji.JPG|thumb|right|''Eisho-ji'' temple, Tokyo]]\nIn February 1882, Kano founded a school and dojo at the {{nihongo3|''Eisho-ji''|\u6c38\u660c\u5bfa}}, a [[buddhism|Buddhist]] temple in what was then the Shitaya ward of Tokyo (now the Higashi Ueno district of [[Tait\u014d, Tokyo|Tait\u014d]] ward).<ref>Hoare (2009) pp. 52\u201353.

Kano took in resident and non-resident students, the first two being [[Tomita Tsunejir\u014d]] and [[Shiro Saigo]].<ref>Kano (2008) p. 20</ref> In August, the following year, the pair were granted {{nihongo3|[[shodan (rank)|shodan]]|\u521d\u6bb5||first rank}} grades, the first that had been awarded in any martial art.<ref>Lowry (2006) p. 49</ref>\n\n=== Judo versus jujutsu ===\n{{main|Kodokan-Totsuka rivalry}}\nCentral to Kano's vision for judo were the principles of {{nihongo3|''seiryoku zen'y\u014d''|\u7cbe\u529b\u5584\u7528||maximum efficiency, minimum effort}} and {{nihongo3|''jita ky\u014dei''|\u81ea\u4ed6\u5171\u6804||mutual welfare and benefit}}. He illustrated the application of ''seiryoku zen'y\u014d'' with the concept of {{nihongo3|''j\u016b yoku g\u014d o seisu''|\u67d4\u3088\u304f\u525b\u3092\u5236\u3059||softness controls hardness}}:\n[[File:Judo.svg|right|thumb|upright=0.45|{{nihongo3|\"Judo\"|\u67d4\u9053|j\u016bd\u014d}}, written in [[kanji]]]]\n{{quotation|In short, resisting a more powerful opponent will result in your defeat, whilst adjusting to and evading your opponent's attack will cause him to lose his balance, his power will be reduced, and you will defeat him. This can apply whatever the relative values of power, thus making it possible for weaker opponents to beat significantly stronger ones. This is the theory of ''ju yoku go o seisu''.<ref>Kano (2005) pp. 39\u201340</ref>}}\n\nKano realised that ''seiryoku zen'y\u014d'', initially conceived as a jujutsu concept, had a wider philosophical application. Coupled with the [[Confucianism|Confucianist]]-influenced ''jita ky\u014dei'', the wider application shaped the development of judo from a {{nihongo3|martial art|\u6b66\u8853|bujutsu}} to a {{nihongo3|martial way|\u6b66\u9053|bud\u014d}}. Kano rejected techniques that did not conform to these principles and emphasised the importance of efficiency in the execution of techniques. He was convinced that practice of jujutsu while conforming to these ideals was a route to self-improvement and the betterment of society in general.<ref>For Kano's opinions on the wider applicability of ''jita ky\u014dei'' to life see for example, Kano (2008) p. 107</ref> He was, however, acutely conscious of the Japanese public's negative perception of jujutsu:\n\n{{quotation|At the time a few bujitsu (martial arts) experts still existed but bujitsu was almost abandoned by the nation at large. Even if I wanted to teach jujitsu most people had now stopped thinking about it. So I thought it better to teach under a different name principally because my objectives were much wider than jujitsu.<ref>Hoare (2009) p. 56</ref>}}\n\nKano believed that \"''j\u016bjutsu''\" was insufficient to describe his art: although {{nihongo3|''Jutsu''|\u8853}} means \"art\" or \"means\", it implies a method consisting of a collection of physical techniques. Accordingly, he changed the second character to {{nihongo3|''d\u014d''|\u9053}}, meaning way, road or path, which implies a more philosophical context than ''jutsu'' and has a common origin with the Chinese concept of ''[[tao]]''. Thus Kano renamed it {{nihongo3|judo|\u67d4\u9053|J\u016bd\u014d}}.<ref>Judo had been used before then, as in the case of a jujutsu school that called itself {{nihongo3|''Chokushin-ry\u016b J\u016bd\u014d''|\u76f4\u4fe1\u6d41\u67d4\u9053||Sometimes rendered as Jikishin-ry\u016b J\u016bd\u014d}}, but its use was rare.</ref>\n\n== Judo ''waza'' (techniques) ==\n{{See also|List of judo techniques|List of Kodokan judo techniques}}\nThere are three basic categories of {{nihongo3|''waza''|\u6280||techniques}} in judo: {{nihongo3|''nage-waza''|\u6295\u3052\u6280||throwing techniques}}, {{nihongo3|''katame-waza''|\u56fa\u6280||grappling techniques}} and {{nihongo3|''atemi-waza''|\u5f53\u3066\u8eab\u6280||striking techniques}}.<ref>Daigo (2005) p. 8</ref> Judo is mostly known for ''nage-waza'' and ''katame-waza''.<ref>Numerous texts exist that describe the ''waza'' of judo in detail.

Several distinct types of ''ukemi'' exist, including {{nihongo3|''ushiro ukemi''|\u5f8c\u308d\u53d7\u8eab||rear breakfalls}}; {{nihongo3|''yoko ukemi''|\u6a2a\u53d7\u3051\u8eab||side breakfalls}}; {{nihongo3|''mae ukemi''|\u524d\u53d7\u3051\u8eab||front breakfalls}}; and {{nihongo3|''zenpo kaiten ukemi''|\u524d\u65b9\u56de\u8ee2\u53d7\u8eab||rolling breakfalls}}<ref>Kano (1994) pp. 45\u201354</ref>\n\nThe person who performs a ''Waza'' is known as {{nihongo3|[[tori (martial arts)|''tori'']]|\u53d6\u308a||literally \"taker\"}} and the person to whom it is performed is known as {{nihongo3|[[uke (martial arts)|''uke'']]|\u53d7\u3051||\"receiver\"}}.<ref>Ishikawa and Draeger (1999) p. 179</ref>\n\n=== ''Nage-waza'' (throwing techniques) ===\n''Nage-waza'' include all techniques in which ''tori'' attempts to throw or trip ''uke'', usually with the aim of placing ''uke'' on his back.

In 1899, Kano was asked to chair a committee of the [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]] to draw up the first formal set of contest rules for jujutsu. These rules were intended to cover contests between different various traditional schools of jujutsu as well as practitioners of Kodokan judo. Contests were 15 minutes long and were judged on the basis of nage waza and katame waza, excluding atemi waza. Wins were by two ippons, awarded in every four-main different path of winning alternatives, by \"Throwing\", where the opponent's back strikes flat onto the mat with sufficient force, by \"Pinning\" them on their back for a \"sufficient\" amount of time, or by Submission, which could be achieved via \"Shime-waza\" or \"Kansetsu-waza\", in which the opponent was forced to give himself or herself up or summon a referee's or corner-judge's stoppage. Finger, toe and ankle locks were prohibited.<ref name=\"judoruleshistory\">Hoare (2005) pp. 4\u20137</ref> In 1900, these rules were adopted by the Kodokan with amendments made to prohibit all joint locks for kyu grades and added wrist locks to the prohibited kansetsu-waza for dan grades. It was also stated that the ratio of tachi-waza to ne-waza should be between 70% to 80% for kyu grades and 60% to 70% for dan grades.<ref name=\"judoruleshistory\"/>\n\nIn 1916, additional rulings were brought in to further limit ''kansetsu waza'' with the prohibition of ''ashi garami'' and neck locks, as well as ''do jime''.<ref>Hoare (2009) p. 109</ref> These were further added to in 1925.\n\nThe first time judo was seen in the [[Olympic Games]] was in an informal demonstration hosted by Kano at the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judoinfo.com/kano.htm |title=The Contribution of Judo to Education by Jigoro Kano |website=Judoinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref> However, Kano was ambivalent about judo's potential inclusion as an Olympic sport:\n{{quotation|I have been asked by people of various sections as to the wisdom and possibility of judo being introduced with other games and sports at the Olympic Games. My view on the matter, at present, is rather passive. If it be the desire of other member countries, I have no objection. But I do not feel inclined to take any initiative. For one thing, judo in reality is not a mere sport or game. I regard it as a principle of life, art and science. In fact, it is a means for personal cultural attainment. Only one of the forms of judo training, so-called randori or free practice can be classed as a form of sport. Certainly, to some extent, the same may be said of boxing and fencing, but today they are practiced and conducted as sports. Then the Olympic Games are so strongly flavored with nationalism that it is possible to be influenced by it and to develop \"Contest Judo\", a retrograde form as ju-jitsu was before the Kodokan was founded. Judo should be free as art and science from any external influences, political, national, racial, and financial or any other organized interest. And all things connected with it should be directed to its ultimate object, the \"Benefit of Humanity\". Human sacrifice is a matter of ancient history.<ref>Koizumi (1947)</ref>}}\n\nNevertheless, judo became an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport for men in the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Games]] in [[Tokyo]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped judo for the 1968 Olympics, meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|date=Mar 1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QdkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27&dq=Sone+Kaminaga+black+belt#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=27}}</ref> Dutchman [[Anton Geesink]] won the first Olympic gold medal in the open division of judo by defeating [[Akio Kaminaga]] of Japan.

In January 2013, the Hantei was removed and the \"Golden Score\" no longer has a time limit.

A shido (\u6307\u5c0e - literally \"guidance\") is awarded for minor rule infringements. A shido can also be awarded for a prolonged period of non-aggression. Recent rule changes allow for the first shidos to result in only warnings. If there is a tie, then and only then, will the number of shidos (if less than three) be used to determine the winner. After three shidos are given, the victory is given to the opponent, constituting an indirect hansoku-make (\u53cd\u5247\u8ca0\u3051 - literally \"foul-play defeat\"), but does not result in expulsion from the tournament.  Note: Prior to 2017, the 4th shido was hansoku make.

The terms judo and jujutsu were quite interchangeable in the early years, so some of these forms of judo are still known as jujutsu or jiu-jitsu either for that reason, or simply to differentiate them from mainstream judo. From Kano's original style of judo, several related forms have evolved\u2014some now widely considered to be distinct arts:\n\n* {{nihongo3|[[Kosen judo]]|\u9ad8\u5c08\u67d4\u9053}}: Sometimes erroneously described as a separate style of judo, Kosen judo is a competition rules set of Kodokan judo that was popularized in the early 20th century for use in Japanese Special High Schools Championships held at Kyoto Imperial University.<ref>Kashiwazaki (1997) pp. 14\u201315</ref> The word \"Kosen\" is an acronym of {{nihongo3|Koto Senmon Gakko|\u9ad8\u7b49\u5c02\u9580\u5b66\u6821||literally \"Higher Professional School\"}}. Kosen judo's focus on newaza has drawn comparisons with Brazilian jiu-jitsu.\n* Russian judo: This distinctive style of judo was influenced by the Russian martial art called [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]]. It is represented by well-known coaches such as [[Alexander Retuinskih]] and [[Igor Yakimov]], and [[mixed martial arts]] fighters such as [[Fedor Emelianenko]] and [[Karo Parisyan]]. In turn, Russian judo has influenced mainstream judo, with techniques such as the [[flying armbar]] being accepted into Kodokan judo.\n* [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] (especially Sport Sambo): [[Vasili Oshchepkov]] was the first European judo black belt under Kano. Oshchepkov went on to contribute his knowledge of judo as one of the three founders of Sambo, which also integrated various international and Soviet bloc wrestling styles and other combative techniques. Oshchepkov died during the political [[Great Purge|purges]] of 1937. In their ''History of Sambo'', Brett Jacques and Scott Anderson wrote that in Russia \"judo and SOMBO were considered to be the same thing\"\u2014albeit with a different uniform and some differences in the rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/stratfordsombo/articles/history-2.html |title=The History of Sombo |website=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>\n* [[Brazilian jiu jitsu]]\n* Freestyle Judo is a form of competitive judo practiced primarily in the USA, that retains techniques that have been removed from mainstream IJF rules.<ref>http://image.aausports.org/dnn/judo/2016/2016JudoHandbook.pdf</ref> Freestyle Judo is currently backed by the International Freestyle Judo Alliance (IFJA). The [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) officially sanctions Freestyle Judo in the [[United States|United States of America]].<ref>http://www.freestylejudo.org/</ref>\n\n== Safety ==\nKano's vision for judo was one of a martial way that could be practiced realistically. Randori (free practice) was a central part of judo pedagogy and shiai (competition) a crucial test of a judoka's understanding of judo.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kano|first=Jigoro|title=The Contribution of Judo to Education|url=http://judoinfo.com/kano1.htm|website=Judoinfo.com|accessdate=10 September 2012}}</ref> Safety necessitated some basic innovations that shaped judo's development. Atemi waza (striking techniques) were entirely limited to kata (prearranged forms) early in judo's history. Kansetsu waza (joint manipulation techniques) were limited to techniques that focused on the elbow joint. Various throwing techniques that were judged to be too dangerous to practice safely were also prohibited in shiai. To maximise safety in nage waza (throwing techniques), judoka trained in ukemi (break falls) and practiced on tatami (rice straw mats).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== ''Kansetsu'' and ''shime waza'' ===\nThe application of joint manipulation and strangulation/choking techniques is generally safe under controlled conditions typical of judo dojo and in competition. It is usual for there to be age restrictions on the practice and application of these types of techniques, but the exact nature of these restrictions will vary from country to country and from organization to organization.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== ''Nage waza'' ===\nSafety in the practice of throwing techniques depends on the skill level of both tori and uke. Inexpertly applied throws have the potential to injure both tori and uke, for instance when tori compensates for poor technique by powering through the throw. Similarly, poor ukemi can result in injury, particularly from more powerful throws that uke lacks the skill to breakfall from. For these reasons, throws are normally taught in order of difficulty for both tori and uke. This is exemplified in the [[List of Kodokan judo techniques|''Gokyo'']] {{nihongo3||\u4e94\u6559||literally \"five teachings\"}}, a traditional grouping of throws arranged in order of difficulty of ukemi. Those grouped in {{nihongo3|''Dai ikkyo''|\u7b2c\u4e00\u6559||literally \"first teaching\"}} are relatively simple to breakfall from whereas those grouped in {{nihongo3|''dai gokyo'' |\u7b2c\u4e94\u6559||literally \"fifth teaching\"}} are difficult to breakfall from.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Judoka (practitioner) ==\nA practitioner of judo is known as a {{nihongo3|judoka|\u67d4\u9053\u5bb6}}. The modern meaning of \"judoka\" in English is a judo practitioner of any level of expertise,<ref name=\"Inokuma and Sato (1987) p. 253\">Inokuma and Sato (1987) p. 253</ref> but traditionally those below the rank of 4th ''dan'' were called {{nihongo3|''kenkyu-sei''|\u7814\u7a76\u751f||trainees}}; and only those of 4th ''[[Dan (rank)|dan]]'' or higher were called \"judoka\". (The suffix {{nihongo3|''-ka''|\u5bb6}}, when added to a noun, means a person with expertise or special knowledge on that subject).\n\nA judo teacher is called {{nihongo3|''[[sensei]]''|\u5148\u751f}}.<ref name=\"Inokuma and Sato (1987) p. 253\"/> The word ''sensei'' comes from ''sen'' or ''saki'' (before) and ''sei'' (life)&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. one who has preceded you. In Western dojo, it is common to call an instructor of any ''dan'' grade ''sensei''. Traditionally, that title was reserved for instructors of 4th ''dan'' and above.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Judogi (uniform) ==\n{{Main article|Judogi}}\n[[File:Judo orange belt (Brusselsshrek).JPG|thumb|left|The judogi is made from a heavy weave to withstand the strength of throwing and grappling.]]\nJudo practitioners traditionally wear white uniforms called {{nihongo3|[[keikogi]]||\u7a3d\u53e4\u7740|keikogi|practice clothing}} or {{nihongo3|[[judogi]]|\u67d4\u9053\u7740|j\u016bd\u014dgi|judo clothing}}.<ref>Inokuma and Sato (1987) p. 253; Lowry (2006) pp. 35\u201361</ref> sometimes abbreviated in the west as \"gi\".

In Japan, both judoka use a white judogi and the traditional red obi (based on the colors of the Japanese flag) is affixed to the belt of one competitor. Outside Japan, a colored obi may also be used for convenience in minor competitions, the blue judogi only being mandatory at the regional or higher levels, depending on organization. Japanese practitioners and traditionalists tend to look down on the use of blue because of the fact that judo is considered a pure sport, and replacing the pure white judogi for the impure blue is an offense.<ref name=\"judogi\" />\n\nFor events organized under the auspices of the International judo Federation (IJF), judogi have to bear the IJF Official Logo Mark Label.

As of 2011, [[List of judoka#Highest grades|fifteen Japanese men]] have been promoted to the tenth degree black belt ''judan'' by the Kodokan, three of whom are still alive;<ref name=judorank/> the IJF and Western and Asian national federations have promoted another eleven who are not recognized (at that level of rank) by the Kodokan. On July 28, 2011, the promotion board of USA Judo awarded [[Keiko Fukuda]] the rank of 10th ''dan'', who was the first woman to be promoted to judo's highest level, albeit not a Kodokan-recognized rank.\n\nAlthough ''dan'' ranks tend to be consistent between national organizations there is more variation in the ''ky\u016b'' grades, with some countries having more ''ky\u016b'' grades. Although initially ''ky\u016b'' grade belt colours were uniformly white, today a variety of colours are used. The first black belts to denote a [[dan rank]] in the 1880s, initially the wide obi was used; as practitioners trained in [[kimono]], only [[white belt|white]] and black obi were used.

Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: [[Kingsley Amis]], [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]], [[John Gardner (British writer)|John Gardner]], [[Raymond Benson]], [[Sebastian Faulks]], [[Jeffery Deaver]], [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]] and [[Anthony Horowitz]]. The latest novel is ''[[Trigger Mortis]]'' by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally [[Charlie Higson]] wrote a series on [[Young Bond|a young James Bond]], and [[Samantha Weinberg|Kate Westbrook]] wrote three novels based on the [[The Moneypenny Diaries|diaries of a recurring series character]], [[Miss Moneypenny|Moneypenny]].\n\nThe character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running film series of all time and have grossed over $7.040 billion in total, making it the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|fourth-highest-grossing film series]] to date, which started in 1962 with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', starring [[Sean Connery]] as Bond. As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been twenty-four films in the [[Eon Productions]] [[James Bond in film|series]]. The most recent Bond film, ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015), stars [[Daniel Craig]] in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (a 1967 [[Parody|spoof]]) and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''). In 2015 the series was estimated to be worth $19.9 billion,<ref>{{cite web|last=Adejobi|first=Alicia|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/spectre-movie-james-bond-brand-worth-13bn-off-back-monster-box-office-dvd-sales-1525914|title=Spectre movie: James Bond brand worth \u00a313bn off the back of monster box office and DVD sales|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|date=27 October 2015|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> making ''James Bond'' one of the [[List of the highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]].\n\nThe Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received [[Academy Award]] nominations on several occasions, and two wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by [[Q (James Bond)|Q Branch]]. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as \"[[Bond girl]]s\".\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===Creation and inspiration===\n{{Main article|James Bond (literary character)|Inspirations for James Bond}}\nIan Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond as the central figure for his works. Bond is an intelligence officer in the [[Secret Intelligence Service]], commonly known as MI6. Bond is known by his code number, 007, and was a [[Royal Naval Reserve]] [[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]]. Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] during the Second World War, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\".<ref name=\" Macintyre (2008)\"/> Among those types were his brother, [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter]], who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in [[Norway in World War II|Norway]] and [[Greece in World War II|Greece]] during the war.<ref name=\"PF Obit (1971)\">{{cite news|title=Obituary: Colonel Peter Fleming, Author and explorer|newspaper= The Times|date=20 August 1971|page=14}}</ref> Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including [[Conrad O'Brien-ffrench]], [[Patrick Dalzel-Job]] and [[Wilfred Dunderdale|Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale]].<ref name= \" Macintyre (2008)\"/>\n\nThe name James Bond came from that of the American [[ornithologist]] [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive [[field guide]] ''[[Birds of the West Indies]]''. Fleming, a keen [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]] himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\".{{sfn|Caplen|2010|p=21}} He further explained that:\n\n{{Quote|text= When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument&nbsp;... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard.|sign= Ian Fleming|source=''[[The New Yorker]]'', 21 April 1962<ref name=\"Hellman (1962)\">{{cite web |last= Hellman |first=Geoffrey T. |title= Bond's Creator |url= http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1962/04/21/1962_04_21_032_TNY_CARDS_000268062 |id= section \"Talk of the Town\" |work= The New Yorker |accessdate=9 September 2011 |authorlink=Geoffrey T. Hellman|page=32|date= 21 April 1962}}</ref>}}\n\nOn another occasion, Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure\u2014an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\"{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=112}}\n\n[[File:Hoagy Carmichael - 1947.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hoagy Carmichael]]\u2014Fleming's view of James Bond]]\nFleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer [[Hoagy Carmichael]] and himself{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=67}} and in [[Casino Royale (novel)|''Casino Royale'']], [[Vesper Lynd]] remarks, \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" Likewise, in [[Moonraker (novel)|''Moonraker'']], [[Special Branch]] Officer [[Gala Brand]] thinks that Bond is \"certainly good-looking&nbsp;... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold.\"{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=67}}\n\nFleming endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}} Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's own as was his behaviour,<ref name=\"Cook (2004)\">{{cite news |last=Cook |first=William |title=Novel man |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |date=28 June 2004|page=40}}</ref> with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming's own. Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.<ref name=\" Macintyre (2008)\"/>\n\nIt was not until the penultimate novel, ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'', that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']] in cinemas and [[Sean Connery]]'s depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=205}} In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in ''[[The Times]]'', Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of [[Glencoe, Highland|Glencoe]], [[Scotland]], and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of [[Vaud]], Switzerland.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=59}} Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]]'s fictional biography of Bond, ''[[James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007]]'', gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920,{{sfn|Pearson|2008|p=21}} while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=27}}\n\n===Novels and related works===\n{{Main article|List of James Bond novels and short stories}}\n\n====Ian Fleming novels====\n[[File:GoldeneyeEstate.jpg|thumb|right|[[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye]], in Jamaica, where Fleming wrote all the Bond novels{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=208}}]]\nWhilst serving in the Naval Intelligence Division, Fleming had planned to become an author<ref name=\"Lycett (DNB)\">{{cite journal|last= Lycett |first=Andrew|title=Fleming, Ian Lancaster (1908\u20131964) (subscription needed)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33168|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=7 September 2011|authorlink=Andrew Lycett|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/33168|year=2004}}</ref> and had told a friend, \"I am going to write the spy story to end all spy stories.\"<ref name=\" Macintyre (2008)\">{{cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|title= Bond \u2013 the real Bond|newspaper=[[The Times]]|page=36|date=5 April 2008}}</ref> On 17 February 1952, he began writing his first James Bond novel, ''Casino Royale'', at his [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in Jamaica,{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=4}} where he wrote all his Bond novels during the months of January and February each year.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=5}} He started the story shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend, Ann Charteris, in order to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials.{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|2003|p=1|loc=ch 1}}\n\nAfter completing the manuscript for ''Casino Royale'', Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend (and later editor) [[William Plomer]] to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, [[Jonathan Cape]], who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter]], an established travel writer.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=5}} Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books \u2013 ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' and ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]'' \u2013 published posthumously.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=75}} All the books were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-

It is a member of the [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] (or Japanese-[[Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan]]) language family, and [[Classification of the Japonic languages|its relation]] to other languages, such as [[Korean language|Korean]], is debated. Japanese has been grouped with language families such as [[Ainu languages|Ainu]], [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], and the now-discredited [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance.\n\nLittle is known of the language's prehistory, or when it first appeared in Japan. Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century. During the [[Heian period]] (794\u20131185), [[Chinese language|Chinese]] had considerable influence on the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|vocabulary]] and [[phonology]] of [[Old Japanese]]. [[Late Middle Japanese]] (1185\u20131600) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, and the first appearance of [[Gairaigo|European loanwords]]. The standard dialect moved from the [[Kansai]] region to the [[Edo]] (modern [[Tokyo]]) region in the [[Early Modern Japanese]] period (early 17th century\u2013mid-19th century). Following the end in 1853 of [[Sakoku|Japan's self-imposed isolation]], the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly. English loanwords, in particular, have become frequent, and [[Wasei-eigo|Japanese words from English roots]] have proliferated.\n\nJapanese is an [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]], [[Mora (linguistics)#Japanese|mora]]-timed language with simple [[phonotactics]], a [[monophthong|pure]] vowel system, phonemic [[Vowel length#Phonemic vowel length|vowel]] and [[Gemination|consonant]] length, and a lexically significant [[Japanese pitch accent|pitch-accent]]. Word order is normally [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] with [[Japanese particles|particles]] marking the grammatical function of words, and sentence structure is [[topic\u2013comment]]. [[Sentence-final particle]]s are used to add emotional or emphatic impact, or make questions. Nouns have no grammatical number or gender, and there are no [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. Verbs are [[Japanese verb conjugation|conjugated]], primarily for [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Voice (grammar)|voice]], but not [[Grammatical person|person]]. [[Japanese equivalents of adjectives]] are also conjugated. Japanese has a complex system of [[Honorific speech in Japanese|honorifics]] with verb forms and vocabulary to indicate the relative status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned.\n\nJapanese has no [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]] with [[Chinese language|Chinese]],<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |title=Handbook to Life in Medieval and Early Modern Japan |first=William E. |last=Deal |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=0816074852 |page=242 |quote=Japanese has no genetic affiliation with Chinese, but neither does it have any clear affiliation with any other language. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKr3XPabVQIC&pg=PA242}}</ref> but it makes extensive use of [[Chinese characters]], or {{Nihongo|''[[kanji]]''|\u6f22\u5b57}}, in its writing system, and a large portion of its vocabulary is [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|borrowed from Chinese]]. Along with ''kanji'', the [[Japanese writing system]] primarily uses two [[syllabary|syllabic]] (or [[Mora (linguistics)|moraic]]) scripts, {{Nihongo|''[[hiragana]]''|\u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a or \u5e73\u4eee\u540d}} and {{Nihongo|''[[katakana]]''|\u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca or \u7247\u4eee\u540d}}. [[Latin script]] is used in a limited fashion, such as for imported acronyms, and the [[Japanese numerals|numeral system]] uses mostly [[Arabic numerals]] alongside traditional [[Chinese numerals]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory===\nA common ancestor of Japanese and Ryukyuan languages or dialects is thought to have been brought to Japan by settlers coming from either continental Asia or nearby Pacific islands sometime in the early- to mid-2nd century BC (the [[Yayoi period]]), replacing the languages of the original [[J\u014dmon]] inhabitants,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/world/asia/04language.html|title=Finding on Dialects Casts New Light on the Origins of the Japanese People|first=Nicholas|last=Wade|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=4 May 2011 |accessdate=7 May 2011}}</ref> including the ancestor of the modern [[Ainu language]]. Very little is known about the Japanese of this period. Because writing like the \"Kanji\" which later devolved into the writing systems \"Hiragana\" and \"Katakana\"<ref name=\":0\" /> had yet to be introduced from China, there is no direct evidence, and anything that can be discerned about this period of Japanese must be based on the reconstructions of [[Old Japanese]].\n\n===Old Japanese===\n[[File:Genryaku Manyosyu.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Page from the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b|A page from the ''[[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]]'', the oldest anthology of classical [[Japanese poetry]]]]\n{{main|Old Japanese}}\nOld Japanese is the oldest attested stage of the Japanese language. Through the spread of [[Buddhism]], the Chinese writing system was imported to Japan. The earliest texts found in Japan are written in [[Classical Chinese]], but they may have been meant to be read as Japanese by the [[kanbun]] method. Some of these Chinese texts show the influences of Japanese grammar, such as the word order (for example, placing the verb after the object). In these hybrid texts, [[Chinese characters]] are also occasionally used phonetically to represent [[Japanese particles]]. The earliest text, the ''[[Kojiki]]'', dates to the early 8th century, and was written entirely in Chinese characters. The end of Old Japanese coincides with the end of the [[Nara period]] in 794. Old Japanese uses the [[Man'y\u014dgana]] system of writing, which uses ''kanji'' for their phonetic as well as semantic values. Based on the Man'y\u014dgana system, Old Japanese can be reconstructed as having 88 distinct syllables. Texts written with Man'y\u014dgana use two different ''kanji'' for each of the syllables now pronounced {{lang|ja|\u304d ki, \u3072 hi, \u307f mi, \u3051 ke, \u3078 he, \u3081 me, \u3053 ko, \u305d so, \u3068 to, \u306e no, \u3082 mo, \u3088 yo and \u308d ro}}.<ref>Shinkichi Hashimoto (February 3, 1918)\u300c\u56fd\u8a9e\u4eee\u540d\u9063\u7814\u7a76\u53f2\u4e0a\u306e\u4e00\u767a\u898b\u2015\u77f3\u585a\u9f8d\u9ebf\u306e\u4eee\u540d\u9063\u5965\u5c71\u8def\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u300d\u300e\u5e1d\u56fd\u6587\u5b66\u300f26\u201311(1949)\u300e\u6587\u5b57\u53ca\u3073\u4eee\u540d\u9063\u306e\u7814\u7a76(\u6a4b\u672c\u9032\u5409\u535a\u58eb\u8457\u4f5c\u96c6 \u7b2c3\u518a)\u300f(\u5ca9\u6ce2\u66f8\u5e97)\u3002</ref> (The ''Kojiki'' has 88, but all later texts have 87. The distinction between mo<sub>1</sub> and mo<sub>2</sub> apparently was lost immediately following its composition.) This set of syllables shrank to 67 in [[Early Middle Japanese]], though some were added through Chinese influence.\n\nDue to these extra syllables, it has been hypothesized that Old Japanese's vowel system was larger than that of Modern Japanese \u2013 it perhaps contained up to eight vowels. According to [[Shinkichi Hashimoto]], the extra syllables in Man'y\u014dgana derive from differences between the vowels of the syllables in question.<ref>\u5927\u91ce \u664b (1953)\u300e\u4e0a\u4ee3\u4eee\u540d\u9063\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u300f(\u5ca9\u6ce2\u66f8\u5e97) p.126</ref> These differences would indicate that Old Japanese had an eight-vowel system,<ref>\u5927\u91ce \u664b (1982)\u300e\u4eee\u540d\u9063\u3044\u3068\u4e0a\u4ee3\u8a9e\u300f(\u5ca9\u6ce2\u66f8\u5e97) p.65</ref> in contrast to the five vowels of later Japanese. The vowel system would have to have shrunk some time between these texts and the invention of the ''[[kana]]'' (''[[hiragana]]'' and ''[[katakana]]'') in the early 9th century. According to this view, the eight-vowel system of ancient Japanese would resemble that of the Uralic and [[Altaic language]] families.<ref>\u6709\u5742 \u79c0\u4e16 (1931)\u300c\u56fd\u8a9e\u306b\u3042\u3089\u306f\u308c\u308b\u4e00\u7a2e\u306e\u6bcd\u97f3\u4ea4\u66ff\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u300d\u300e\u97f3\u58f0\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u300f\u7b2c4\u8f2f(1957\u5e74\u306e\u300e\u56fd\u8a9e\u97f3\u97fb\u53f2\u306e\u7814\u7a76 \u5897\u88dc\u65b0\u7248\u300f(\u4e09\u7701\u5802)</ref> However, it is not fully certain that the alternation between syllables necessarily reflects a difference in the vowels rather than the consonants \u2013 at the moment, the only undisputed fact is that they are different syllables. A newer reconstruction of ancient Japanese shows strikingly similarities with Southeast-Asian languages, especially with [[Austronesian languages]].<ref name=\"Alexander\">{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Vovin,|title=Proto-Japanese beyond the accent system|url=https://www.academia.edu/19253123/Proto-Japanese_beyond_the_accent_system|journal=Current Issues in Linguistic Theory|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOld Japanese does not have {{IPA|/h/}}, but rather {{IPA|/\u0278/}} (preserved in modern ''fu'', {{IPA|/\u0278\u026f/}}), which has been reconstructed to an earlier *{{IPA|/p/}}. Man'y\u014dgana also has a symbol for {{IPA|/je/}}, which merges with {{IPA|/e/}} before the end of the period.\n\nSeveral fossilizations of Old Japanese grammatical elements remain in the modern language \u2013 the genitive particle ''tsu'' (superseded by modern ''no'') is preserved in words such as ''matsuge'' (\"eyelash\", lit. \"hair of the eye\"); modern ''mieru'' (\"to be visible\") and ''kikoeru'' (\"to be audible\") retain what may have been a [[mediopassive voice|mediopassive]] suffix -''yu(ru)'' (''kikoyu'' \u2192 ''kikoyuru'' (the attributive form, which slowly replaced the plain form starting in the late Heian period) > ''kikoeru'' (as all shimo-nidan verbs in modern Japanese did)); and the genitive particle ''ga'' remains in intentionally archaic speech.\n\n===Early Middle Japanese===\n[[File:Genji emaki 01003 001.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two pages from Genji Monogatari emaki scroll|Two pages from a 12th-century [[emaki]] scroll of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' from the 11th century]]\n{{main|Early Middle Japanese}}\nEarly Middle Japanese is the Japanese of the [[Heian period]], from 794 to 1185. Early Middle Japanese sees a significant amount of Chinese influence on the language's phonology \u2013 length distinctions become phonemic for both consonants and vowels, and series of both labialised (e.g. ''kwa'') and palatalised (''kya'') consonants are added.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Intervocalic {{IPA|/\u0278/}} merges with {{IPA|/w/}} by the 11th century.\nThe end of Early Middle Japanese sees the beginning of a shift where the attributive form (Japanese ''rentaikei'') slowly replaces the uninflected form (''sh\u016bshikei'') for those verb classes where the two were distinct.\n\n===Late Middle Japanese===\n{{main|Late Middle Japanese}}\nLate Middle Japanese covers the years from 1185 to 1600, and is normally divided into two sections, roughly equivalent to the [[Kamakura period]] and the [[Muromachi period]], respectively. The later forms of Late Middle Japanese are the first to be described by non-native sources, in this case the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] and [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] missionaries; and thus there is better documentation of Late Middle Japanese phonology than for previous forms (for instance, the ''[[Arte da Lingoa de Iapam]]''). Among other sound changes, the sequence {{IPA|/au/}} merges to {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}, in contrast with {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}; {{IPA|/p/}} is reintroduced from Chinese; and {{IPA|/we/}} merges with {{IPA|/je/}}. Some forms rather more familiar to Modern Japanese speakers begin to appear \u2013 the continuative ending -''te'' begins to reduce onto the verb (e.g. ''yonde'' for earlier ''yomite''), the -k- in the final syllable of adjectives drops out (''shiroi'' for earlier ''shiroki''); and some forms exist where modern standard Japanese has retained the earlier form (e.g. ''hayaku'' > ''hayau'' > ''hay\u0254\u0254'', where modern Japanese just has ''hayaku'', though the alternative form is preserved in the standard greeting ''o-hay\u014d gozaimasu'' \"good morning\"; this ending is also seen in ''o-medet\u014d'' \"congratulations\", from ''medetaku'').\n\nLate Middle Japanese has the first loanwords from European languages \u2013 now-common words borrowed into Japanese in this period include ''pan'' (\"bread\") and ''tabako'' (\"tobacco\", now \"cigarette\"), both from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].\n\n===Early Modern Japanese===\n{{main|Early Modern Japanese}}\nEarly Modern Japanese, not to be confused with Modern Japanese, was the dialect used after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Because the two languages are extremely similar, Early Modern Japanese is commonly referred to as Modern Japanese. Early Modern Japanese gradually evolved into Modern Japanese during the 19th century. Only after 1945, shortly after World War II,  did Modern Japanese become the standard language, seeing use in most official communications.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Language Adaptation|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|year=1989|isbn=0-521-36255-5|location=|pages=107}}</ref> In this time period the Japanese in addition to their use of Katakana and Hiragana they also used traditional Chinese characters called \"[[Chinese characters|Han]]\" which later developed in \"Kanji\" which is a form of writing used to express ideas in the Japanese and Chinese languages.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Minimal Old Chinese and Later Han Chinese : A Companion to Grammata Serica Recensa.|last=SCHUESSLER|first=KARLGREN|publisher=Honolulu : University of Hawaii Press|year=2009|isbn=9780824832643|location=Honolulu|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Japanese===\nModern Japanese is considered to begin with the [[Edo period]], which lasted between 1603 and 1868. Since Old Japanese, the de facto standard Japanese had been the [[Kansai dialect]], especially that of [[Kyoto]]. However, during the Edo period, Edo (now Tokyo) developed into the largest city in Japan, and the Edo-area dialect became standard Japanese. Since the end of [[Sakoku|Japan's self-imposed isolation]] in 1853, the flow of loanwords from European languages has increased significantly. The period since 1945 has seen a large number of words borrowed from other languages{{mdash}}such as German, Portuguese and English.<ref>Miura, Akira, ''English in Japanese'', Weatherhill, 1998.</ref> Many English loan words especially relate to technology{{mdash}}for example, ''pasokon'' (short for \"personal computer\"), ''int\u0101netto'' (\"internet\"), and ''kamera'' (\"camera\"). Due to the large quantity of English loanwords, modern Japanese has developed a distinction between {{IPA|/t\u0255i/}} and {{IPA|/ti/}}, and {{IPA|/d\u0291i/}} and {{IPA|/di/}}, with the latter in each pair only found in loanwords.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n==Geographic distribution==\nAlthough Japanese is spoken almost exclusively in Japan, it has been spoken outside.

There is a form of the language considered standard: {{nihongo|''hy\u014djungo''|\u6a19\u6e96\u8a9e}}, meaning \"standard Japanese\", or {{nihongo|''ky\u014dts\u016bgo''|\u5171\u901a\u8a9e}}, \"common language\". The meanings of the two terms are almost the same. ''Hy\u014djungo'' or ''ky\u014dts\u016bgo'' is a conception that forms the counterpart of dialect. This normative language was born after the {{nihongo|[[Meiji Restoration]]|\u660e\u6cbb\u7dad\u65b0|meiji ishin|1868}} from the language spoken in the higher-class areas of Tokyo (see [[Yamanote]]). ''Hy\u014djungo'' is taught in schools and used on television and even<!--???--> in official communications.{{cn|date=October 2018}} It is the version of Japanese discussed in this article.\n\nFormerly, standard {{nihongo|Japanese in writing|\u6587\u8a9e|[[Bungo (Japanese language)|bungo]]|\"literary language\"}} was different from {{nihongo|colloquial language|\u53e3\u8a9e|[[Kogo (Japanese language)|k\u014dgo]]}}. The two systems have different rules of grammar and some variance in vocabulary. ''Bungo'' was the main method of writing Japanese until about 1900; since then ''k\u014dgo'' gradually extended its influence and the two methods were both used in writing until the 1940s. ''Bungo'' still has some relevance for historians, literary scholars, and lawyers (many Japanese laws that survived [[World War II]] are still written in ''bungo'', although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language). ''K\u014dgo'' is the dominant method of both speaking and writing Japanese today, although ''bungo'' grammar and vocabulary are occasionally used in modern Japanese for effect.\n\n===Dialects===\n{{Main|Japanese dialects}}\n[[File:Japanese dialects-en.png|thumb|Map of Japanese dialects and Japonic languages]]\n\nDozens of dialects are spoken in Japan. The profusion is due to many factors, including the length of time the [[Japanese Archipelago]] has been inhabited, its mountainous island terrain, and Japan's long history of both external and internal isolation. Dialects typically differ in terms of [[Japanese pitch accent|pitch accent]], inflectional [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[vocabulary]], and particle usage. Some even differ in [[vowel]] and [[consonant]] inventories, although this is uncommon.\n\nThe main distinction in Japanese accents is between {{nihongo|Tokyo-type|\u6771\u4eac\u5f0f|T\u014dky\u014d-shiki}} and {{nihongo|Kyoto-Osaka-type|\u4eac\u962a\u5f0f|Keihan-shiki}}. Within each type are several subdivisions. Kyoto-Osaka-type dialects are in the central region, roughly formed by [[Kansai region|Kansai]], [[Shikoku]], and western [[Hokuriku region]]s.\n\nDialects from peripheral regions, such as [[T\u014dhoku Region|T\u014dhoku]] or [[Kagoshima Prefecture|Kagoshima]], may be unintelligible to speakers from the other parts of the country. There are some [[language island]]s in mountain villages or isolated islands such as [[Hachij\u014djima|Hachij\u014d-jima island]] whose dialects are descended from the Eastern dialect of [[Old Japanese]]. Dialects of the [[Kansai region]] are spoken or known by many Japanese, and [[Osaka]] dialect in particular is associated with comedy (see [[Kansai dialect]]). Dialects of T\u014dhoku and North [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d]] are associated with typical farmers.\n\nThe [[Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages]], spoken in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] and the [[Amami Islands]] (politically part of [[Kagoshima Prefecture|Kagoshima]]), are distinct enough to be considered a separate branch of the [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] family; not only is each language unintelligible to Japanese speakers, but most are unintelligible to those who speak other Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages. However, in contrast to linguists, many ordinary Japanese people tend to consider the Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages as dialects of Japanese. he imperial court also seems to have spoken an unusual variant of the Japanese of the time.<ref>See the comments of George Kizaki in {{cite web|last1=Stuky|first1=Natalie-Kyoko|title=Exclusive: From Internment Camp to MacArthur's Aide in Rebuilding Japan|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/08/from-internment-camp-to-macarthur-s-aide.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref> Most likely being the spoken form of [[Classical Japanese language]], a writing style that was prevalent during the [[Heian period]], but began decline during the late [[Meiji period]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Language Adaptation|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|year=1989|isbn=0-521-36255-5|location=|pages=106}}</ref>\n\nModern Japanese has become prevalent nationwide (including the Ry\u016bky\u016b islands) due to [[education]], [[mass media]], and an increase of mobility within Japan, as well as economic integration.\n\n== Classification ==\n{{see also|Classification of the Japonic languages}}\n\nJapanese is a member of the [[Japonic languages]] family, which also includes the [[Ryukyuan languages|languages]] spoken throughout the [[Ry\u016bky\u016b Islands]]. As these closely related languages are commonly treated as dialects of the same language, Japanese is often called a [[language isolate]].\n\nAccording to Martine Irma Robbeets, Japanese has been subject to more attempts to show its relation to other languages than any other language in the world.{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=20}} Since Japanese first gained the consideration of linguists in the late 19th century, attempts have been made to show its genealogical relation to languages or language families such as Ainu, Korean, Chinese, [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]], [[Ural\u2013Altaic languages|Ural-Altaic]], Altaic, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Mon\u2013Khmer languages|Mon\u2013Khmer]], [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] and [[Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan]]. At the fringe, some linguists have suggested a link to [[Indo-European languages]], including [[Greek language|Greek]], and to [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]]. As it stands, only the link to Ryukyuan has wide support, though linguist Kurakichi Shiratori maintained that Japanese was a language isolate.{{sfn|Kindaichi|Hirano|1978|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n===Korean hypothesis===\nSimilarities between [[Korean language|Korean]] and Japanese were noted by [[Arai Hakuseki]] in 1717,{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=25}} and the idea that the two might be related was first proposed in 1781 by Japanese scholar Teikan Fujii.{{sfnm|1a1=Robbeets|1y=2005|1p=25|2a1=Vovin|2y=2010|2p=3}} The idea received little attention until [[William George Aston]] proposed it again in 1879. Japanese scholar Sh\u014dsabur\u014d Kanazawa took it up in 1910, as did Shinpei Ogura in 1934. Shir\u014d Hattori was nearly alone when he criticised these theories in 1959.{{sfn|Vovin|2010|p=3}} [[Samuel Martin (linguist)|Samuel Martin]] furthered the idea in 1966 with his \"Lexical evidence relating Korean to Japanese\", as did John Whitman with his dissertation on the subject in 1985.{{sfnm|1a1=Robbeets|1y=2005|1p=25|2a1=Vovin|2y=2010|2p=3}} Despite this, definitive proof of the relation has yet to be provided. Historical linguists studying Japanese and Korean tend to accept the genealogical relation, while general linguists and historical linguists in Japan and Korea have remained skeptical.{{sfn|Vovin|2010|p=3}}\n\n[[Alexander Vovin]] suggests that, while [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] modern Korean and Japanese share similarities that sometimes allow word-to-word translations, studies of the pre-modern languages show greater differences. According to Vovin, this suggests [[Language convergence|linguistic convergence]] rather than [[Language divergence|divergence]], which he believes is amongst the evidence of the languages not having a genealogical connection.{{sfn|Vovin|2010|p=6}}\n\n===Altaic hypothesis===\n<!--Linked from infobox above-->\n[[File:Altaic family2.svg|thumb|alt=Map of distribution of proposed Altaic languages|Distribution of the proposed [[Altaic languages]] across [[Eurasia]], tentatively including Japanese and [[Korean language|Korean]]]]\nThe largely discredited [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] family, which would include languages from far eastern Europe to northeastern Asia, has had its supporters and detractors over its history. The most controversial aspect of the hypothesis is the proposed inclusion of Korean and Japanese, which even some proponents of Altaic have rejected.{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=18}} [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] suggested the connection in 1832,{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=20}} but the inclusion first attracted significant attention in the early 1970s.{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=19}} [[Roy Andrew Miller]] published ''Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages'', and dedicated much of his later career to the subject. [[Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin|Sergei Starostin]] published a 1991 monograph which was another significant stepping stone in Japanese\u2014Altaic research. A team of scholars made a database of Altaic etymologies available over the internet, from which the three-volume ''Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages'' was published in 2003.{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=22}} Scholars such as [[Yevgeny Polivanov]] and Yoshizo Itabashi, on the other hand, have proposed a hybrid origin of Japanese, in which [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] and Altaic elements became mixed.<ref>http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/kumar1996does.pdf</ref>{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|pp=21, 23}}\n\nSkepticism over the Japanese relation to Altaic is widespread among Altaic's proponents, in part because of a large number of unsuccessful attempts to establish genealogical relationships with Japanese and other languages.{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=20}} Opinions are polarized, with many strongly convinced of the Altaic relation, and others strongly convinced of the lack of one. While some sources are undecided, often strong proponents of either view will not even acknowledge the claims of the other side.{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|pp=26\u201327}}\n\n===Southeast Asian languages===\nJapanese shows in its proto-form strong similarities to Southeast Asian languages.<ref name=\"Alexander\"/> A 2015 analysis using the [[Automated Similarity Judgment Program]] resulted in the Japonic languages being grouped with the [[Ainu languages|Ainu]] and then with the [[Austroasiatic languages]].<ref>Gerhard J\u00e4ger, \"Support for linguistic macrofamilies from weighted sequence alignment.\" ''PNAS'' vol. 112 no. 41, 12752\u201312757, {{doi|10.1073/pnas.1500331112}}.

The only unusual vowel is the high back vowel {{IPA|/u/}} {{Audio|Ja-U.oga|''listen''}}, which may be [[roundedness|compressed]] rather than rounded and fronted. Japanese has five vowels, and [[vowel length]] is phonemic, with each having both a short and a long version. Elongated vowels are usually denoted with a line over the vowel (a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]) in [[Romanization of Japanese|r\u014dmaji]], a repeated vowel character in [[hiragana]], or a [[ch\u014donpu]] succeeding the vowel in [[katakana]].\n\nSome Japanese consonants have several [[allophone]]s, which may give the impression of a larger inventory of sounds. However, some of these allophones have since become phonemic. For example, in the Japanese language up to and including the first half of the 20th century, the phonemic sequence {{IPA|/ti/}} was [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] and realized phonetically as {{IPA|[t\u0255i]}}, approximately ''chi'' {{Audio|Ja-Chi 2.oga|''listen''}}; however, now {{IPA|[ti]}} and {{IPA|[t\u0255i]}} are distinct, as evidenced by words like ''t\u012b'' {{IPA|[ti\u02d0]}} \"Western style tea\" and ''chii'' {{IPA|[t\u0255ii]}} \"social status\".\n\nThe \"r\" of the Japanese language is of particular interest, ranging between an [[apical consonant|apical]] [[central consonant|central]] [[tap consonant|tap]] and a [[lateral approximant]]. The \"g\" is also notable; unless it starts a sentence, it may be pronounced {{IPAblink|\u014b}}, in the Kanto prestige dialect and in other eastern dialects.\n\nThe syllabic structure and the [[phonotactics]] are very simple: the only [[consonant cluster]]s allowed within a syllable consist of one of a subset of the consonants plus {{IPA|/j/}}. This type of cluster only occurs in onsets. However, consonant clusters across syllables are allowed as long as the two consonants are a nasal followed by a [[homorganic]] consonant. [[Gemination|Consonant length]] (gemination) is also phonemic.\n\nThe phonology of Japanese also includes a [[Japanese pitch accent|pitch accent system]], which is a system that helps differentiate words with identical [[Hiragana]] spelling or words in different [[Japanese dialects]]. An example of words with identical Hiragana would be the words {{IPA|[ha\ua71c.\u0255i]}} (\"chopsticks\") and {{IPA|[ha.\u0255i\ua71c]}} (\"bridge\"), both spelled (\u306f\u3057, ''hashi'') in Hiragana. The stresses differentiate the words.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bullock|first1=Ben|title=What is Japanese pitch accent?|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/pitch-accent.html|publisher=Ben Bullock|accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n{{no footnotes|section|date=November 2013}}\n<!--Please keep in mind that this section is intended to be a summary and should not dominate the article. If you feel like going in-depth about something regarding Japanese grammar, please add it to the main article linked below.-->\n{{Main|Japanese grammar}}\n\n===Sentence structure===\nJapanese word order is classified as [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]. Unlike many [[Indo-European languages]], the only strict rule of word order is that the verb must be placed at the end of a sentence (possibly followed by sentence-end particles). This is because Japanese sentence elements are marked with [[Japanese particles|particles]] that identify their grammatical functions.\n\nThe basic sentence structure is [[topic\u2013comment]]. For example, ''Kochira wa Tanaka-san desu'' ({{lang|ja|\u3053\u3061\u3089\u306f\u7530\u4e2d\u3055\u3093\u3067\u3059}}). ''kochira'' (\"this\") is the topic of the sentence, indicated by the particle '' wa''. The verb ''de aru'' (''desu'' is a contraction of its polite form ''de arimasu'') is a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], commonly translated as \"to be\" or \"it is\" (though there are other verbs that can be translated as \"to be\"), though technically it holds no meaning and is used to give a sentence 'politeness'. As a phrase, ''Tanaka-san desu'' is the comment. This sentence literally translates to \"As for this person, (it) is Mr./Ms. Tanaka.\" Thus Japanese, like many other Asian languages, is often called a [[topic-prominent language]], which means it has a strong tendency to indicate the topic separately from the subject, and that the two do not always coincide. The sentence ''Z\u014d wa hana ga nagai '' ({{lang|ja|\u8c61\u306f\u9f3b\u304c\u9577\u3044}}) literally means, \"As for elephant(s), (the) nose(s) (is/are) long\". The topic is ''z\u014d'' \"elephant\", and the subject is ''hana'' \"nose\".\n\nIn Japanese, the subject or object of a sentence need not be stated if it is obvious from context. As a result of this grammatical permissiveness, there is a tendency to gravitate towards brevity; Japanese speakers tend to omit [[pronoun]]s on the theory they are inferred from the previous sentence, and are therefore understood. In the context of the above example, ''hana-ga nagai'' would mean \"[their] noses are long,\" while ''nagai'' by itself would mean \"[they] are long.\" A single verb can be a complete sentence: ''Yatta!'' ({{lang|ja|\u3084\u3063\u305f!}}) \"[I / we / they / etc] did [it]!\". In addition, since adjectives can form the predicate in a Japanese sentence (below), a single adjective can be a complete sentence: ''Urayamashii!'' ({{lang|ja|\u7fa8\u307e\u3057\u3044!}}) \"[I'm] jealous [of it]!\".\n\nWhile the language has some words that are typically translated as pronouns, these are not used as frequently as pronouns in some Indo-European languages, and function differently. In some cases Japanese relies on special verb forms and auxiliary verbs to indicate the direction of benefit of an action: \"down\" to indicate the out-group gives a benefit to the in-group; and \"up\" to indicate the in-group gives a benefit to the out-group. Here, the in-group includes the speaker and the out-group does not, and their boundary depends on context. For example, ''oshiete moratta'' ({{lang|ja|\u6559\u3048\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3063\u305f}}) (literally, \"explained\" with a benefit from the out-group to the in-group) means \"[he/she/they] explained [it] to [me/us]\". Similarly, ''oshiete ageta'' ({{lang|ja|\u6559\u3048\u3066\u3042\u3052\u305f}}) (literally, \"explained\" with a benefit from the in-group to the out-group) means \"[I/we] explained [it] to [him/her/them]\". Such beneficiary auxiliary verbs thus serve a function comparable to that of pronouns and prepositions in Indo-European languages to indicate the actor and the recipient of an action.\n\n[[Japanese pronouns|Japanese \"pronouns\"]] also function differently from most modern Indo-European pronouns (and more like nouns) in that they can take modifiers as any other noun may. For instance, one does not say in English:\n: *The amazed he ran down the street. (grammatically incorrect insertion of a pronoun)\nBut one ''can'' grammatically say essentially the same thing in Japanese:\n: {{lang|ja|\u9a5a\u3044\u305f\u5f7c\u306f\u9053\u3092\u8d70\u3063\u3066\u3044\u3063\u305f\u3002}}\n: ''Odoroita kare wa michi o hashitte itta.'' (grammatically correct)\n\nThis is partly because these words evolved from regular nouns, such as ''kimi'' \"you\" ({{lang|ja|\u541b}} \"lord\"), ''anata'' \"you\" ({{lang|ja|\u3042\u306a\u305f}} \"that side, yonder\"), and ''boku'' \"I\" ({{lang|ja|\u50d5}} \"servant\"). This is why some linguists do not classify Japanese \"pronouns\" as pronouns, but rather as referential nouns, much like Spanish ''usted'' (contracted from ''vuestra merced'', \"your [(flattering [[Majestic plural|majestic]]) [[Majestic plural|plural]]] grace\") or Portuguese ''o senhor''. Japanese personal pronouns are generally used only in situations requiring special emphasis as to who is doing what to whom.\n\nThe choice of words used as pronouns is correlated with the sex of the speaker and the social situation in which they are spoken: men and women alike in a formal situation generally refer to themselves as ''watashi'' ({{lang|ja|\u79c1}} \"private\") or ''watakushi'' (also {{lang|ja|\u79c1}}), while men in rougher or intimate conversation are much more likely to use the word ''ore'' ({{lang|ja|\u4ffa}} \"oneself\", \"myself\") or ''boku''. Similarly, different words such as ''anata'', ''kimi'', and ''omae'' ({{lang|ja|\u304a\u524d}}, more formally {{lang|ja|\u5fa1\u524d}} \"the one before me\") may be used to refer to a listener depending on the listener's relative social position and the degree of familiarity between the speaker and the listener. When used in different social relationships, the same word may have positive (intimate or respectful) or negative (distant or disrespectful) connotations.\n\nJapanese often use titles of the person referred to where pronouns would be used in English. For example, when speaking to one's teacher, it is appropriate to use ''sensei'' ({{lang|ja|\u5148\u751f}}, teacher), but inappropriate to use ''anata''. This is because ''anata'' is used to refer to people of equal or lower status, and one's teacher has higher status.\n\n===Inflection and conjugation===\nJapanese nouns have no grammatical number, gender or article aspect. The noun ''hon'' ({{lang |ja|\u672c}}) may refer to a single book or several books; ''hito'' ({{lang|ja|\u4eba}}) can mean \"person\" or \"people\", and ''ki'' ({{lang |ja|\u6728}}) can be \"tree\" or \"trees\". Where number is important, it can be indicated by providing a quantity (often with a [[Japanese counter word|counter word]]) or (rarely) by adding a suffix, <!--example? meaning \"hito-tachi\" and \"mono-domo\"?--> or sometimes by duplication (e.g. {{lang|ja|\u4eba\u4eba}}, ''hitobito'', usually written with an iteration mark as {{lang|ja|\u4eba\u3005}}). Words for people are usually understood as singular. Thus ''Tanaka-san'' usually means ''Mr./Ms. Tanaka''. Words that refer to people and animals can be made to indicate a group of individuals through the addition of a collective suffix (a noun suffix that indicates a group), such as ''-tachi'', but this is not a true plural: the meaning is closer to the English phrase \"and company\". A group described as ''Tanaka-san-tachi'' may include people not named Tanaka. Some Japanese nouns are effectively plural, such as ''hitobito'' \"people\" and ''wareware'' \"we/us\", while the word ''tomodachi'' \"friend\" is considered singular, although plural in form.\n\nVerbs are [[Japanese verb conjugations|conjugated]] to show tenses, of which there are two: past and present (or non-past) which is used for the present and the future. For verbs that represent an ongoing process, the ''-te iru'' form indicates a continuous (or progressive) [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], similar to the suffix ''ing'' in English. For others that represent a change of state, the ''-te iru'' form indicates a perfect aspect. For example, ''kite iru'' means \"He has come (and is still here)\", but ''tabete iru'' means \"He is eating\".\n\nQuestions (both with an interrogative pronoun and yes/no questions) have the same structure as affirmative sentences, but with intonation rising at the end. In the formal register, the question particle ''-ka'' is added. For example, ''ii desu'' ({{lang|ja|\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059}}) \"It is OK\" becomes ''ii desu-ka'' ({{lang|ja|\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002}}) \"Is it OK?\". In a more informal tone sometimes the particle ''-no'' ({{lang|ja|\u306e}}) is added instead to show a personal interest of the speaker: ''D\u014dshite konai-no?'' \"Why aren't (you) coming?\". Some simple queries are formed simply by mentioning the topic with an interrogative intonation to call for the hearer's attention: ''Kore wa?'' \"(What about) this?\"; ''O-namae wa?'' ({{lang|ja|\u304a\u540d\u524d\u306f\uff1f}}) \"(What's your) name?\".\n\nNegatives are formed by inflecting the verb. For example, ''Pan o taberu'' ({{lang|ja|\u30d1\u30f3\u3092\u98df\u3079\u308b\u3002}}) \"I will eat bread\" or \"I eat bread\" becomes ''Pan o tabenai'' ({{lang|ja|\u30d1\u30f3\u3092\u98df\u3079\u306a\u3044\u3002}}) \"I will not eat bread\" or \"I do not eat bread\". Plain negative forms are actually ''i''-adjectives (see below) and inflect as such, e.g. ''Pan o tabenakatta'' ({{lang|ja|\u30d1\u30f3\u3092\u98df\u3079\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002}}) \"I did not eat bread\".\n\nThe so-called ''-te'' verb form is used for a variety of purposes: either progressive or perfect aspect (see above); combining verbs in a temporal sequence (''Asagohan o tabete sugu dekakeru'' \"I'll eat breakfast and leave at once\"), simple commands, conditional statements and permissions (''Dekakete-mo ii?'' \"May I go out?\"), etc.\n\nThe word ''da'' (plain), ''desu'' (polite) is the [[Copula (linguistics)#Japanese|copula]] verb. It corresponds approximately to the English ''be'', but often takes on other roles, including a marker for tense, when the verb is conjugated into its past form ''datta'' (plain), ''deshita'' (polite). This comes into use because only ''i''-adjectives and verbs can carry tense in Japanese. Two additional common verbs are used to indicate existence (\"there is\") or, in some contexts, property: ''aru'' (negative ''nai'') and ''iru'' (negative ''inai''), for inanimate and animate things, respectively. For example, ''Neko ga iru'' \"There's a cat\", ''Ii kangae-ga nai'' \"[I] haven't got a good idea\".\n\nThe verb \"to do\" (''suru'', polite form ''shimasu'') is often used to make verbs from nouns (''ry\u014dri suru'' \"to cook\", ''benky\u014d suru'' \"to study\", etc.) and has been productive in creating modern slang words. Japanese also has a huge number of compound verbs to express concepts that are described in English using a verb and an adverbial particle (e.g. ''tobidasu'' \"to fly out, to flee,\" from ''tobu'' \"to fly, to jump\" + ''dasu'' \"to put out, to emit\").\n\nThere are three types of adjective (see [[Japanese adjectives]]):\n# {{lang|ja|\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e}} ''keiy\u014dshi'', or ''i'' adjectives, which have a [[Japanese verb conjugations|conjugating]] ending ''i'' ({{lang|ja|\u3044}}) (such as {{lang|ja|\u6691\u3044}} ''atsui'' \"to be hot\") which can become past ({{lang|ja|\u6691\u304b\u3063\u305f}} ''atsukatta'' \"it was hot\"), or negative ({{lang|ja|\u6691\u304f\u306a\u3044}} ''atsuku nai'' \"it is not hot\"). Note that ''nai'' is also an ''i'' adjective, which can become past ({{lang|ja|\u6691\u304f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f}} ''atsuku nakatta'' \"it was not hot\").\n#: {{lang|ja|\u6691\u3044\u65e5}} ''atsui hi'' \"a hot day\".\n# {{lang|ja|\u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e}} ''keiy\u014dd\u014dshi'', or ''na'' adjectives, which are followed by a form of the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], usually ''na''. For example, ''hen'' (strange)\n#: {{lang|ja|\u5909\u306a\u3072\u3068}} ''hen na hito'' \"a strange person\".\n# {{lang|ja|\u9023\u4f53\u8a5e}} ''rentaishi'', also called true adjectives, such as ''ano'' \"that\"\n#: {{lang|ja|\u3042\u306e\u5c71}} ''ano yama'' \"that mountain\".\n\nBoth ''keiy\u014dshi'' and ''keiy\u014dd\u014dshi'' may [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] sentences. For example,\n: {{lang|ja|\u3054\u98ef\u304c\u71b1\u3044\u3002}} ''Gohan ga atsui.'' \"The rice is hot.\"\n: {{lang|ja|\u5f7c\u306f\u5909\u3060\u3002}} ''Kare wa hen da.'' \"He's strange.\"\nBoth inflect, though they do not show the full range of conjugation found in true verbs.\nThe ''rentaishi'' in Modern Japanese are few in number, and unlike the other words, are limited to directly modifying nouns. They never predicate sentences. Examples include ''ookina'' \"big\", ''kono'' \"this\", ''iwayuru'' \"so-called\" and ''taishita'' \"amazing\".\n\nBoth ''keiy\u014dd\u014dshi'' and ''keiy\u014dshi'' form [[adverb]]s, by following with ''ni'' in the case of ''keiy\u014dd\u014dshi'':\n: {{lang|ja|\u5909\u306b\u306a\u308b}} ''hen ni naru'' \"become strange\",\nand by changing ''i'' to ''ku'' in the case of ''keiy\u014dshi'':\n: {{lang|ja|\u71b1\u304f\u306a\u308b}} ''atsuku naru'' \"become hot\".\n\nThe grammatical function of nouns is indicated by [[postposition]]s, also called [[Japanese particles|particles]]. These include for example:\n* '''{{lang|ja|\u304c}} ''ga''''' for the [[nominative case]]. \n: {{lang|ja|'''\u5f7c\u304c'''\u3084\u3063\u305f\u3002}}'''''Kare ga''' yatta.'' \"'''He''' did it.\"\n* '''{{lang|ja|\u306b}} ''ni''''' for the [[dative case]].\n: {{lang|ja|'''\u7530\u4e2d\u3055\u3093\u306b'''\u3042\u3052\u3066\u4e0b\u3055\u3044\u3002}} '''''Tanaka-san ni''' agete kudasai'' \"Please give it '''to Mr. Tanaka'''.\"\nIt is also used for the [[lative]] case, indicating a motion to a location.\n: {{lang|ja|'''\u65e5\u672c\u306b'''\u884c\u304d\u305f\u3044\u3002}} '''''Nihon ni''' ikitai'' \"I want to go '''to Japan'''.\"\n*However, '''\u3078 ''e''''' is more commonly used for the lative case.\n: {{lang|ja|'''\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u3078'''\u884c\u304b\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3002}} '''''p\u0101t\u012b e''' ikanai ka?'' \"Won't you go '''to the party'''?\"\n* '''{{lang|ja|\u306e}} ''no''''' for the [[genitive case]], or nominalizing phrases.\n: {{lang|ja|'''\u79c1\u306e'''\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3002}} '''watashi no''' kamera'' \"'''my''' camera\"\n: {{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc\u306b\u884c\u304f'''\u306e'''\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059\u3002}} ''Suk\u012b-ni iku '''no''' ga suki desu'' \"(I) like go'''ing''' skiing.\"\n* '''{{lang|ja|\u3092}} ''o''''' for the [[accusative case]]. \n: {{lang|ja|'''\u4f55\u3092'''\u98df\u3079\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002}} '''''Nani o''' tabemasu ka?'' \"'''What''' will (you) eat?\"\n* '''{{lang|ja|\u306f}} ''wa''''' for the topic. It can co-exist with the case markers listed above, and it overrides ''ga'' and (in most cases) ''o''.\n: {{lang|ja|'''\u79c1\u306f'''\u5bff\u53f8\u304c\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002}} '''''Watashi wa''' sushi ga ii desu.'' (literally) \"'''As for me''', sushi is good.\" The nominative marker ''ga'' after ''watashi'' is hidden under ''wa''.\n\nNote: The subtle difference between '''''wa''''' and '''''ga''''' in Japanese cannot be derived from the English language as such, because the distinction between sentence topic and subject is not made there. While ''wa'' indicates the topic, which the rest of the sentence describes or acts upon, it carries the implication that the subject indicated by ''wa'' is not unique, or may be part of a larger group.\n: ''Ikeda-san '''wa''' yonj\u016b-ni sai da.'' \"As for Mr. Ikeda, he is forty-two years old.\" Others in the group may also be of that age.\nAbsence of ''wa'' often means the subject is the [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] of the sentence.\n: ''Ikeda-san '''ga''' yonj\u016b-ni sai da.'' \"It is Mr. Ikeda who is forty-two years old.\" This is a reply to an implicit or explicit question, such as \"who in this group is forty-two years old?\"\n\n===Politeness===\n{{Main|Honorific speech in Japanese}}\n\nJapanese has an extensive grammatical system to express politeness and formality. This reflects the hierarchical nature of Japanese society.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miyagawa|first=Shigeru|title=The Japanese Language|url=http://web.mit.edu/jpnet/articles/JapaneseLanguage.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Japanese language can express differing levels in social status. The differences in social position are determined by a variety of factors including job, age, experience, or even psychological state (e.g., a person asking a favour tends to do so politely). The person in the lower position is expected to use a polite form of speech, whereas the other person might use a plainer form. Strangers will also speak to each other politely. Japanese children rarely use polite speech until they are teens, at which point they are expected to begin speaking in a more adult manner. ''See [[uchi-soto]]''.\n\nWhereas ''teineigo'' ({{lang|ja|\u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e}}) (polite language) is commonly an [[inflection]]al system, ''sonkeigo'' ({{lang|ja|\u5c0a\u656c\u8a9e}}) (respectful language) and ''kenj\u014dgo'' ({{lang|ja|\u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e}}) (humble language) often employ many special honorific and humble alternate verbs: ''iku'' \"go\" becomes ''ikimasu'' in polite form, but is replaced by ''irassharu'' in honorific speech and ''ukagau'' or ''mairu'' in humble speech.\n\nThe difference between honorific and humble speech is particularly pronounced in the Japanese language. Humble language is used to talk about oneself or one's own group (company, family) whilst honorific language is mostly used when describing the interlocutor and their group. For example, the ''-san'' suffix (\"Mr\" \"Mrs.\" or \"Miss\") is an example of honorific language. It is not used to talk about oneself or when talking about someone from one's company to an external person, since the company is the speaker's in-group. When speaking directly to one's superior in one's company or when speaking with other employees within one's company about a superior, a Japanese person will use vocabulary and inflections of the honorific register to refer to the in-group superior and their speech and actions. When speaking to a person from another company (i.e., a member of an out-group), however, a Japanese person will use the plain or the humble register to refer to the speech and actions of their own in-group superiors. In short, the register used in Japanese to refer to the person, speech, or actions of any particular individual varies depending on the relationship (either in-group or out-group) between the speaker and listener, as well as depending on the relative status of the speaker, listener, and third-person referents.\n\nMost [[noun]]s in the Japanese language may be made polite by the addition of ''o-'' or ''go-'' as a prefix. ''o-'' is generally used for words of native Japanese origin, whereas ''go-'' is affixed to words of Chinese derivation. In some cases, the prefix has become a fixed part of the word, and is included even in regular speech, such as ''gohan'' 'cooked rice; meal.' Such a construction often indicates deference to either the item's owner or to the object itself. For example, the word ''tomodachi'' 'friend,' would become ''o-tomodachi'' when referring to the friend of someone of higher status (though mothers often use this form to refer to their children's friends). On the other hand, a polite speaker may sometimes refer to ''mizu'' 'water' as ''o-mizu'' in order to show politeness.\n\nMost Japanese people employ politeness to indicate a lack of familiarity. That is, they use polite forms for new acquaintances, but if a relationship becomes more intimate, they no longer use them. This occurs regardless of age, social class, or gender.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n{{further|Yamato kotoba|Gairaigo}}\nThere are three main sources of words in the Japanese language, the ''yamato kotoba'' (\u5927\u548c\u8a00\u8449) or ''wago'' (\u548c\u8a9e), ''kango'' (\u6f22\u8a9e), and ''gairaigo'' (\u5916\u6765\u8a9e).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/yamato-kotoba-language/|title=Yamato Kotoba: The REAL Japanese Language|last=Koichi|website=Tofugu|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-26}}</ref>\n\nThe original language of Japan, or at least the original language of a certain population that was ancestral to a significant portion of the historical and present Japanese nation, was the so-called ''[[yamato kotoba]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u5927\u548c\u8a00\u8449}} or infrequently {{lang|ja|\u5927\u548c\u8a5e}}, i.e. \"[[Yamato people|Yamato]] words\"), which in scholarly contexts is sometimes referred to as ''wago'' ({{lang|ja|\u548c\u8a9e}} or rarely {{lang|ja|\u502d\u8a9e}}, i.e. the \"[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]] language\"). In addition to words from this original language, present-day Japanese includes a number of words that were either borrowed from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or constructed from Chinese roots following Chinese patterns. These words, known as ''[[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|kango]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u6f22\u8a9e}}), entered the language from the 5th century onwards via contact with Chinese culture. According to the ''Shinsen Kokugo Jiten'' (\u65b0\u9078\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178) [[Japanese dictionary]], ''kango'' comprise 49.1% of the total vocabulary, ''wago'' make up 33.8%, other foreign words or ''[[gairaigo]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u5916\u6765\u8a9e}}) account for 8.8%, and the remaining 8.3% constitute hybridized words or ''konshugo'' ({{lang|ja|\u6df7\u7a2e\u8a9e}}) that draw elements from more than one language.<ref>\u65b0\u9078\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178, \u91d1\u7530\u4e00\u4eac\u52a9, \u5c0f\u5b66\u9928, 2001, {{ISBN|4-09-501407-5}}</ref>\n\nThere are also a great number of words of mimetic origin in Japanese, with Japanese having a rich collection of [[Japanese sound symbolism|sound symbolism]], both onomatopoeia for physical sounds, and more abstract words. A small number of words have come into Japanese from the [[Ainu language]]. ''Tonakai'' ([[reindeer]]), ''rakko'' ([[sea otter]]) and ''[[shishamo]]'' ([[Smelts|smelt]], a type of fish) are well-known examples of words of Ainu origin.\n\nWords of different origins occupy different [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] in Japanese. Like Latin-derived words in English, ''kango'' words are typically perceived as somewhat formal or academic compared to equivalent Yamato words. Indeed, it is generally fair to say that an English word derived from Latin/French roots typically corresponds to a Sino-Japanese word in Japanese, whereas a simpler [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon word]] would best be translated by a Yamato equivalent.\n\nIncorporating vocabulary from [[languages of Europe|European languages]], ''gairaigo'', began with [[Japanese words of Portuguese origin|borrowings from Portuguese]] in the 16th century, followed by words from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] during Japan's [[sakoku|long isolation]] of the [[Edo period]]. With the [[Meiji Restoration]] and the reopening of Japan in the 19th century, borrowing occurred from [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]]. Today most borrowings are from English.\n\nIn the Meiji era, the Japanese also coined many neologisms using Chinese roots and morphology to translate European concepts;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} these are known as [[wasei kango]] (Japanese-made Chinese words). Many of these were then imported into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese via their kanji in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} For example, ''seiji'' \u653f\u6cbb (\"politics\"), and ''kagaku'' \u5316\u5b66 (\"chemistry\") are words derived from Chinese roots that were first created and used by the Japanese, and only later borrowed into Chinese and other East Asian languages. As a result, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese share a large common corpus of vocabulary in the same way a large number of Greek- and Latin-derived words \u2013 both inherited or borrowed into European languages, or modern coinages from Greek or Latin roots \u2013 are shared among modern European languages \u2013 see [[classical compound]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nIn the past few decades, ''[[wasei-eigo]]'' (\"made-in-Japan English\") has become a prominent phenomenon.

Later, during the 7th century AD, the Chinese-sounding phoneme principle was used to write pure Japanese poetry and prose, but some Japanese words were still written with characters for their meaning and not the original Chinese sound. This is when the history of Japanese as a written language begins in its own right. By this time, the Japanese language was already very distinct from the [[Ryukyuan languages]].<ref>Heinrich, Patrick.

They{{who|date=May 2018}} then started to use Chinese characters to write Japanese in a style known as ''man'y\u014dgana'', a syllabic script which used Chinese characters for their sounds in order to transcribe the words of Japanese speech syllable by syllable.\n\nOver time, a writing system evolved. [[Chinese characters]] ([[kanji]]) were used to write either words borrowed from Chinese, or Japanese words with the same or similar meanings. Chinese characters were also used to write grammatical elements, were simplified, and eventually became two syllabic scripts: [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] which were developed based on [[Manyogana]] from Baekje.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=70352|author=John R.

Hiragana was seen as an informal language, whereas Katakana and Kanji were considered more formal and was typically used by men and in official settings. However, because of hiragana's easy of use, more and more people began using it. Eventually, by the 10th century, hiragana was used by everyone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/japanese_hiragana.htm|title=Japanese Hiragana|last=Ager|first=Simon|date=2017|website=Omniglot|access-date=26 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nModern Japanese is written in a mixture of three main systems: [[kanji]], characters of Chinese origin used to represent both Chinese [[loanword]]s into Japanese and a number of native Japanese [[morpheme]]s; and two [[syllabary|syllabaries]]: [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]]. The [[Latin script]] (or romaji in Japanese) is used to a certain extent, such as for imported acronyms and to transcribe Japanese names and in other instances where non-Japanese speakers need to know how to pronounce a word (such as \"ramen\" at a restaurant). Arabic numerals are much more common than the kanji when used in counting, but kanji numerals are still used in compounds, such as {{lang|ja|\u7d71\u4e00}} ''t\u014ditsu'' (\"unification\").\n\nHistorically, attempts to limit the number of kanji in use commenced in the mid-19th century, but did not become a matter of government intervention until after Japan's defeat in the Second World War. During the period of post-war occupation (and influenced by the views of some U.S. officials), various schemes including the complete abolition of kanji and exclusive use of r\u014dmaji were considered. The ''[[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]]'' (\"common use kanji\", originally called ''[[t\u014dy\u014d kanji]]'' [kanji for general use]) scheme arose as a compromise solution.\n\nJapanese students begin to learn kanji from their first year at elementary school. A guideline created by the Japanese Ministry of Education, the list of ''[[ky\u014diku kanji]]'' (\"education kanji\", a subset of ''[[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]]''), specifies the 1,006 simple characters a child is to learn by the end of sixth grade. Children continue to study another 1,130 characters in junior high school, covering in total 2,136 ''[[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]]''. The official list of ''[[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]]'' was revised several times, but the total number of officially sanctioned characters remained largely unchanged.\n\nAs for kanji for personal names, the circumstances are somewhat complicated. ''[[J\u014dy\u014d kanji]]'' and ''[[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]]'' (an appendix of additional characters for names) are approved for registering personal names. Names containing unapproved characters are denied registration. However, as with the list of ''[[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]]'', criteria for inclusion were often arbitrary and led to many common and popular characters being disapproved for use. Under popular pressure and following a court decision holding the exclusion of common characters unlawful, the list of ''[[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]]'' was substantially extended from 92 in 1951 (the year it was first decreed) to 983 in 2004. Furthermore, families whose names are not on these lists were permitted to continue using the older forms.\n\n===Hiragana===\n''[[Hiragana]]'' are used for words without kanji representation, for words no longer written in kanji, and also following kanji to show conjugational endings. Because of the way verbs (and adjectives) in Japanese are [[Japanese verb conjugations|conjugated]], kanji alone cannot fully convey Japanese tense and mood, as kanji cannot be subject to variation when written without losing its meaning. For this reason, hiragana are suffixed to the ends of kanji to show verb and adjective conjugations. Hiragana used in this way are called [[okurigana]]. Hiragana can also be written in a superscript called [[furigana]] above or beside a kanji to show the proper reading. This is done to facilitate learning, as well as to clarify particularly old or obscure (or sometimes invented) readings.\n\n===Katakana===\n''[[Katakana]]'', like hiragana, are a [[syllabary]]; katakana are primarily used to write foreign words, plant and animal names, and for emphasis. For example, \"Australia\" has been adapted as ''\u014csutoraria'' ({{lang|ja|\u30aa\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30ea\u30a2}}), and \"supermarket\" has been adapted and shortened into ''s\u016bp\u0101'' ({{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc}}).\n\n==Study by non-native speakers==\nMany major universities throughout the world provide Japanese language courses, and a number of secondary and even primary schools worldwide offer courses in the language. This is much changed from before [[World War II]]; in 1940, only 65 Americans not [[Japanese American|of Japanese descent]] were able to read, write and understand the language.<ref>[[Beate Sirota Gordon]] commencement address at [[Mills College]], 14 May 2011.

Close to 4 million people studied the language worldwide in 2012: more than 1 million Chinese, 872,000 Indonesian, and 840,000 South Koreans studied Japanese in lower and higher educational institutions. In the three years from 2009 to 2012 the number of students studying Japanese in [[China]] increased by 26.5 percent/three years, and by 21.8 percent in [[Indonesia]], but dropped 12.8 percent in [[South Korea]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/07/15/ri-ranks-no-2-learning-japanese-language.html |title=RI ranks No. 2 in learning Japanese language |date=15 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan, more than 90,000 foreign students studied at [[List of universities in Japan|Japanese universities]] and Japanese [[language school]]s, including 77,000 Chinese and 15,000 South Koreans in 2003. In addition, local governments and some [[non-profit organisation|NPO]] groups provide free Japanese language classes for foreign residents, including [[Japanese Brazilian]]s and foreigners married to Japanese nationals. In the United Kingdom, study of the Japanese language is supported by the [[British Association for Japanese Studies]]. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], Japanese is offered as a language in the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]] in some schools.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe Japanese government provides standardized tests to measure spoken and written comprehension of Japanese for second language learners; the most prominent is the [[Japanese Language Proficiency Test]] (JLPT), which features five levels of exams (changed from four levels in 2010), ranging from elementary (N5) to advanced (N1). The JLPT is offered twice a year. The Japanese External Trade Organization [[JETRO]] organizes the ''Business Japanese Proficiency Test'' which tests the learner's ability to understand Japanese in a business setting. The Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation, which took over the BJT from JETRO in 2009, announced in August 2010 that the test would be discontinued in 2011 due to financial pressures on the Foundation. However, it has since issued a statement to the effect that the test will continue to be available as a result of support from the Japanese government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kanken.or.jp/bjt/english/index.html |title=BJT Business Japanese Proficiency Test |publisher=Kanken.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kanken.or.jp/bjt/pdf/statement-e.pdf |title=Relaunching of the Business Japanese Proficiency Test in FY 2012 and Temporary Measures in FY 2011 |date=25 November 2012 |publisher=Kanken.or.jp |accessdate=2012-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221212636/http://www.kanken.or.jp/bjt/pdf/statement-e.pdf |archivedate=21 December 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Japan|Language}}\n* [[Aizuchi]]\n* [[Culture of Japan]]\n* [[Japanese dictionaries]]\n* [[Japanese exonyms]]\n* [[Japanese language and computers]]\n* [[Japanese literature]]\n* [[Japanese name]]\n* [[Japanese orthography issues]]\n* [[Japanese Sign Language family]]\n* [[Wiktionary:Category:Japanese language|Japanese words]] and [[Wiktionary:Category:Japanese derivations|words derived from Japanese in other languages]] at [[Wiktionary]], Wikipedia's sibling project\n* [[Rendaku]]\n* [[Romanization of Japanese]]\n** [[Hepburn romanization]]\n* ''[[Shogakukan Progressive Japanese-English Dictionary|Shogakukan Progressive Japanese\u2013English Dictionary]]'' (book)\n* [[Yojijukugo]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Bloch, Bernard (1946).

He gradually realizes that he has lost his arms, legs, and all of his face (including his eyes, ears, teeth, and tongue), but that his mind functions perfectly, leaving him a [[Locked-in syndrome|prisoner in his own body]].\n\nJoe attempts suicide by suffocation, but finds that he had been given a [[tracheotomy]] that he can neither remove nor control. At first Joe wishes to die, but he later decides that he desires to be placed in a glass box and toured around the country in order to show others the true horrors of war. Joe successfully communicates these desires with military officials after months and months of banging his head on his pillow in [[Morse code]]. However, he realizes that the military will not grant his wishes, as it is \"against regulations\". It is implied that he will live the rest of his natural life in his condition.\n\nAs Joe drifts between reality and [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]], he remembers his old life with his family and girlfriend, and reflects upon the [[myth]]s and realities of war.\n\n==Characters==\n; Joe Bonham\nJoe Bonham is the main character. \"The novel mainly consists of his reminiscences of childhood and his current struggle to remain [[sanity|sane]] and, finally, to communicate.\"<ref name=\"SparkNotes-CharacterAnalysis\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/johnnygun/canalysis.html|title=SparkNotes: Johnny Got His Gun: Analysis of Major Characters|publisher=SparkNotes.com|accessdate=2009-08-07}}</ref>\n\n; Regular day nurse\n\"As a caretaker, capable of great [[humanism|humanistic]] love, the regular day nurse stands apart from the terse medical establishment, represented by the Morse code man, yet is not capable of the perceptive sympathy of the new day nurse.\"<ref name=\"SparkNotes-CharacterAnalysis\" />\n\n; Bill Bonham (Joe's father)\nJoe's father, Bill Bonham, courted Joe's mother and raised a family with her in [[Colorado]]. \"His character comes to stand for Joe's nostalgia for an older way of life.\" It is also said that Bill passes away (chapter 1) leaving his mother and his younger sisters alone (one aged 13 years, the other aged about 9 years).<ref name=\"SparkNotes-CharacterAnalysis\" />\n\n; Marcia Bonham (Joe's mother)\nJoe's mother, Marcia Bonham, was always close to Joe and Bill. She is referenced regularly in the book singing, cooking/baking and playing the piano often.\n\n;Kareen (Joe's girlfriend before he leaves for war)\nKareen (who was aged 19 years at the time of Joe's departure) is mentioned throughout the book as Joe floats between reality and fantasy. She and Joe sleep together for the first time (chapter 3) the night before he leaves, with her father's approval.\n\n;Diane (Joe's first girlfriend)\nDiane is only mentioned in chapter 4. In that chapter it is mentioned that she cheated on Joe with a boy named Glen Hogan. She also cheats on Joe with his best friend, Bill Harper (who told him that she cheated with Hogan).\n\n;Bill Harper (Joe's best friend)\nBill Harper warns Joe that Diane has cheated on him with Glen Hogan. Joe, who doesn't believe the news, hits Bill. Joe later finds out Bill was truthful and decides that he wants to renew their friendship. However, he finds Bill and Diane [[making out]] at her home and is hurt by both. The end of chapter 4 references how Bill was killed at [[Battle of Belleau Wood|Belleau Wood]].\n\n;Howie\nJoe meets Howie (chapter 4) after his troubles with Diane and Glen Hogan. It seems that Howie was never able to keep a girl in his life, and his girlfriend Onie also cheated on him with Glen Hogan. Joe and Howie decide not only to forget about their girlfriends but also about Glen Hogan. Joe and Howie join a group of Mexicans working on a railroad. However, once Howie receives an apologetic [[telegram]] from Onie, the boys decide to return home.\n\n;Jos\u00e9\nJos\u00e9 worked at a bakery with Joe. He was given the job at the bakery through the local homeless shelter. Jos\u00e9 has many stories that set him apart from the other homeless workers, including the fact that he refused marriage to a wealthy woman. Jos\u00e9 wanted to work in Hollywood. When the opportunity presented itself to work for a picture company, Jos\u00e9 purposely gets fired because he feels his own personal honor will not allow him to quit on the boss that gave him his original opportunity.\n\n;New day nurse\nThe new day nurse was the first person to successfully communicate with Joe after his injuries. She moved her finger on his bare chest in the shape of the letter M until Joe signaled that he understood \"M\". She then spelled out \"MERRY CHRISTMAS\" and Joe signaled that he understood. The new day nurse then deduced that Joe's head-banging was in Morse Code and fetched someone who knew Morse Code.\n\n==Title and context==\nThe title is a play on the phrase \"Johnny get your gun\",<ref name=\"SparkNotes-Themes\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/johnnygun/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Johnny Got His Gun: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|publisher=SparkNotes.com|accessdate=2009-08-07}}</ref>\na rallying call that was commonly used to encourage young American men to enlist in the military in the late 19th and early 20th century. That phrase was popularized in the [[George M.

The novel was inspired by an article he read about the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]]' visit to a [[Canadians|Canadian]] veterans hospital to see a soldier who had lost all of his senses and his limbs (possibly Ethelbert \u201cCurley\u201d Christian, though he did not suffer severe facial wounds or lose any of his senses 1, 2, 3, and 4 in references). \"Though the novel was a [[pacifist]] piece published in wartime, it was well reviewed and won an American Booksellers Award in 1940.\"<ref name=\"SparkNotes-Context\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/johnnygun/context.html|title=SparkNotes: Johnny Got His Gun: Context|publisher=SparkNotes.com|accessdate=2009-08-07}}</ref>\n(It was published two days after the declaration of war in Europe, more than two years before the United States joined World War II.)\n\n==Publication==\nSerialized in the ''[[Daily Worker]]'' in March 1940,<ref>{{cite web|first=Fred|last=de Fossard|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/review_of_books/article/a-triumph-of-anti-war-literature/16751#.WzDMRxJKiT8|title=A Triumph of Anti-War Literature|website=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]|location=London, England|date=March 2015|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}</ref> the book became \"a rally point for the [[political left]]\" which had [[Opposition to World War II|opposed involvement in World War II]] during the period of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]].

After receiving letters from right-wing [[United States non-interventionism|isolationists]] requesting copies of the book, Trumbo contacted the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and turned these letters over to them.

Simon]] and biologist [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]], betting on a mutually agreed-upon measure of [[Natural resource|resource]] [[scarcity]] over the decade leading up to 1990. The widely-followed contest originated in the pages of ''[[Social Science Quarterly]]'', where Simon challenged Ehrlich to put his money where his mouth was. In response to Ehrlich's published claim that \"If I were a gambler, I would take [[even money]] that England will not exist in the year 2000\" Simon offered to take that bet, or, more realistically, \"to stake US$10,000 ... on my belief that the cost of non-government-controlled raw materials (including grain and oil) will not rise in the long run.\"\n\nSimon challenged Ehrlich to choose any raw material he wanted and a date more than a year away, and he would wager on the inflation-adjusted prices decreasing as opposed to increasing. Ehrlich chose [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], [[tin]], and [[tungsten]]. The bet was formalized on September 29, 1980, with September 29, 1990 as the payoff date. Ehrlich lost the bet, as all five commodities that were bet on declined in price from 1980 through 1990, the wager period.<ref name=Gorelick>{{cite book|last=Gorelick|first=Steven M.|title=Oil Panic and the Global Crisis: Predictions and Myths|year=2009|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-1405195485|page=104}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn 1968, Ehrlich published ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', which argued that mankind was facing a demographic catastrophe with the rate of population growth quickly outstripping growth in the supply of food and resources. Simon was highly skeptical of such claims, so proposed a wager, telling Ehrlich to select any raw material he wanted and select \"any date more than a year away,\" and Simon would bet that the commodity's price on that date would be lower than what it was at the time of the wager.\n\nEhrlich and his colleagues picked five metals that they thought would undergo big price increases: chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten. Then, on paper, they bought $200 worth of each, for a total bet of $1,000, using the prices on September 29, 1980, as an index. They designated September 29, 1990, 10 years hence, as the payoff date. If the inflation-adjusted prices of the various metals rose in the interim, Simon would pay Ehrlich the combined difference. If the prices fell, Ehrlich et al. would pay Simon.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1990, the world's population grew by more than 800 million, the largest increase in one decade in all of history.

Some of the trends listed above are actually predicted by Simon's theory of resource development, and do not in themselves even count as costs (as pollution does). E.g., he pointed out that due to increased efficiency, the amount of cropland required and actually used to grow food for each person has decreased over time and is likely to continue to do so (p.5). The same might potentially be true of decreased reliance on firewood in developing countries, and per capita use of specific food sources like rice, wheat, and fish, if economic development makes a diverse range of alternative foods available. Some have also proven false, e.g., the amount of ozone in the lower atmosphere has decreased from 1994 to 2004.<ref>url=https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/ozone-trends</ref>\n\n==Other wagers==\nIn 1996, Simon bet $1000 with David South, professor of the Auburn University School of Forestry, that the inflation-adjusted price of timber would decrease in the following five years. Simon paid out early on the bet in 1997 (before his death in 1998) based on his expectation that prices would remain above 1996 levels (which they did).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forestry.auburn.edu/sfnmc/web/bet.html |title=The Simon South Bet On Pine Sawtimber |publisher=Forestry.auburn.edu |date=1998-02-08 |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Xuoqlqvo?url=http://www.forestry.auburn.edu/sfnmc/web/bet.html |archivedate=2008-05-18 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, when ''[[The Economist]]'' headlined an article entitled, \"$5 a barrel oil soon?\" and with oil trading in the $12/barrel range, David South offered $1000 to any economist who would bet with him that the price of oil would be greater than $12/barrel in 2010.  No economist took him up on the offer. However, in October 2000, Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, an economist with The University of the West Indies, bet $1000 with David South that the inflation-adjusted price of oil would decrease to an inflation-adjusted price of $25 by 2010 (down from what was then $30/barrel).

Tenniel had five siblings; two brothers and three sisters. One sister, Mary, was later to marry Thomas Goodwin Green, owner of the pottery that produced [[Cornishware]]. Tenniel was a quiet and introverted person, both as a boy and as an adult. He was content to remain firmly out of the limelight and seemed unaffected by competition or change. His biographer Rodney Engen wrote that Tenniel's \"life and career was that of the supreme gentlemanly outside, living on the edge of respectability.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Engen |first1=Rodney |title=Sir John Tenniel: Alice's White Knight |date=1991 |publisher=Scolar Press |location=Brookfield, VT |page=1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1840, Tenniel, while practising fencing with his father, received a serious eye wound from his father's foil, which had accidentally lost its protective tip.

So, it was here that Tenniel returned to his earlier independent education. While Tenniel's more formal training at the Royal Academy and at other institutions was beneficial in nurturing his artistic ambitions, it failed in Tenniel's mind because he disagreed with the school's teaching methods, resulting in Tenniel educating himself for his career. Tenniel studied classical sculptures through painting; however, Tenniel was frustrated that he was never taught how to draw.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Engen |first1=Rodney |title=Sir John Tenniel: Alice's White Knight |date=1991 |publisher=Scolar Press |location=Brookfield, VT |page=7}}</ref> Tenniel would draw the classical statues at the London's Townley Gallery, copied illustrations from books of costumes and armor in the British museum, and drew the animals from the zoo in [[Regent's Park]] as well as the actors from the London theatres, which were drawn from the pits.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |title=Artist of Wonderland: The Life, Political Cartoons, and Illustrations of Tenniel |last1=Morris |first1=Frankie |date=2005 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |year= |isbn= |location=Charlottesville |page=10 |pages=}}</ref> It was in these studies that Tenniel learned to love detail; however, he became impatient with his work and was the happiest when he could draw from memory.

In the mid-1840s Tenniel joined the Artist's Society or Clipstone Street Life Academy, and it could be said here that Tenniel first emerged as a satirical draftsman.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Frankie |title=Artist of Wonderland: The Life, Political Cartoons, and Illustrations of Tenniel |date=2005 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |page=35}}</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nTenniel's first book illustration was for [[Samuel Carter Hall]]'s ''The Book of British Ballads'', in 1842.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Engen |first1=Rodney |title=Sir John Tenniel: Alice's White Knight |date=1991 |publisher=Scolar Press |location=Brookfield, VT |page=15}}</ref> While engaged with his first book illustrations, various contests were taking place in London, as a way in which the government could combat the growing Germanic [[Nazarene movement|Nazarenes]] style and promote a truly national English school of art.

He had been selected on the strength of his recent illustrations to [[Aesop]]'s ''Fables''. He contributed his first drawing in the initial letter appearing on p.&nbsp;224, vol. xix. His first cartoon was ''Lord Jack the Giant Killer'', which showed [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] assailing [[Nicholas Patrick Stephen Wiseman|Cardinal Wiseman]].\n\nIn 1861, Tenniel was offered John Leech's position at ''Punch'', as political cartoonist; however, Tenniel still maintained some sense of decorum and restraint into the heated social and political issues of the day.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Engen |first1=Rodney |title=Sir John Tenniel: Alice's White Knight |date=1991 |publisher=Scolar Press |location=Brookfield, VT |page=46}}</ref>\n\nBecause his task was to construct the willful choices of his ''Punch'' editors, who probably took their cue from ''[[The Times]]'' and would have felt the suggestions of political tensions from Parliament as well, Tenniel's work, as was its design, could be scathing in effect. The restlessness of the Victorian period's issues of working class radicalism, labor, war, economy, and other national themes were the targets of ''Punch'', which in turn commanded the nature of Tenniel's subjects. Tenniel's cartoons published in the 1860s made popular the portrait of the Irishman as a sub-human being, wanton in his appetites and most resembling an orangutan in both facial features and posture.<ref name=\"dav\">{{cite book |title=James Joyce, Ulysses, and the Construction of Jewish Identity |publisher=Cambridge University Press |author=Davison, Neil |year=1998 |location=Cambridge |page=97}}</ref> Many of Tenniel's political cartoons expressed strong hostility to [[Irish Nationalism]], with [[Fenian]]s and [[Irish National Land League|Land leagues]] depicted as monstrous, ape-like brutes, while \"[[Hibernia (personification)|Hibernia]]\"\u2014the personification of Ireland\u2014was depicted as a beautiful, helpless young girl threatened by these \"monsters\" and turning for protection to \"her elder sister\", the powerful armoured [[Britannia]].\n\n\"An Unequal Match\", his drawing published in ''Punch'' on 8 October 1881, depicted a police officer fighting a criminal with only a 'baton' for protection, trying to put a point across to the public that policing methods needed to be changed.\n\nWhen examined separately from the book illustrations he did over time, Tenniel's work at ''Punch'' alone, expressing decades of editorial viewpoints, often controversial and socially sensitive, was created to echo the voices of the British public. Tenniel drew 2,165 cartoons for ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', a liberal and politically active publication that mirrored the Victorian public's mood for liberal social changes; thus Tenniel, in his cartoons, represented for years the conscience of the British majority.\n\nIn his career Tenniel contributed around 2,300 cartoons, innumerable minor drawings, many double-page cartoons for ''Punch's Almanac'' and other special numbers, and 250 designs for ''Punch's Pocket-books''. By 1866 he was \"able to command ten to fifteen guineas for the reworking of a single ''Punch'' cartoon as a pencil sketch\", alongside his \"comfortable\" ''Punch'' salary \"of about \u00a3800 a year\".<ref name=\"Simpson\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoiceFSYw_wC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63 |title=Sir John Tenniel: Aspects of His Work |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=1994 |accessdate=March 13, 2012 |author=Simpson, Roger |pages=68 |isbn=9780838634936 }}</ref> According to the [[Bank of England]] inflation calculator,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Pages/resources/inflationtools/calculator/flash/default.aspx |title=Inflation Calculator |publisher=[[Bank of England]] |access-date=28 May 2016}}</ref> \u00a3800 in 1866 would buy goods and services worth over \u00a385,000 in 2015 (with inflation averaged at 3.1% a year).\n\n===Alice===\n[[File:Alice 05a-1116x1492.jpg|thumb|Caterpillar using a [[hookah]]. An illustration from ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'']]\nDespite the thousands of political cartoons and hundreds of illustrative works attributed to him, much of Tenniel's fame stems from his illustrations for ''Alice''. Tenniel drew ninety-two drawings for Lewis Carroll's ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (London: Macmillan, 1865) and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There]]'' (London: Macmillan, 1871).\n\nLewis Carroll originally illustrated ''Wonderland'' himself, but his artistic abilities were limited. Engraver Orlando Jewitt, who had worked for Carroll in 1859 and had reviewed Carroll's drawings for ''Wonderland'', suggested that he employ a professional illustrator. Carroll was a regular reader of ''Punch'' and was therefore familiar with Tenniel. In 1865 Tenniel, after long talks with Carroll, illustrated the first edition of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''.\n\n[[Image:Tenniel ms eng 718 6 p177.jpeg|thumb|left|Chapter 12: Alice's evidence.

His drawings for both books have become some of the most famous literary illustrations. After 1872, when the Carroll projects were finished, Tenniel largely abandoned literary illustration. Carroll did later approach Tenniel to undertake another project for him. To this Tenniel replied:\n{{Quote|It is a curious fact that with \"Looking-Glass\" the faculty of making drawings for book illustrations departed from me, and ... I have done nothing in that direction since.<ref>See Michael Hancher's essay, \"Carroll and Tenniel in Collaboration\", ''The Tenniel Illustrations to the Alice Books'': 105</ref>}}\n\nTenniel's illustrations for the ''Alice'' books were [[wood engraving|engraved]] onto blocks of deal wood by the [[Brothers Dalziel]]. These engravings were then used as masters for making the [[electrotype]] copies for the actual printing of the books.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johntenniel.com/about.php |title=About Tenniel |website=Sir John Tenniel's Alice in Wonderland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604030121/http://www.johntenniel.com/about.php |archive-date=4 June 2004 |publisher=GoldmarkArt.com}}</ref> The original wood blocks are held in the collection of the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford. They are not usually on public display, but were exhibited in 2003.{{cn|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Style==\n===Influence of German Nazarenes===\nThe style associated with the [[Nazarene movement]] of the nineteenth century influenced many subsequent artists including Tenniel. This style can be characterized as \"shaded outlines\" where the lines on the side of figures or objects are given extra thickness or are drawn as double lines in order to suggest shading or volume.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Frankie |title=Artist of Wonderland: The Life, Political Cartoons, and Illustrations of Tenniel |date=2005 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |page=37}}</ref> Additionally, this style is extremely precise, with the artist making a hard clear outline along its figures, creating dignified figures and compositions, as well as a restraint in expression and paleness of tone.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Frankie |title=Artist of Wonderland: The Life, Political Cartoons, and Illustrations of Tenniel |date=2005 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |page=120}}</ref> While Tenniel's early illustrations done in the Nazarene style were not well received, his encounter with the style pointed him in the right direction.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Engen |first1=Rodney |title=Sir John Tenniel: Alice's White Knight |date=1991 |publisher=Scolar Press |location=Brookfield, VT |page=21}}</ref>\n\n===Eye for detail===\nAfter the 1850s, Tenniel's style modernized to incorporate more detail in backgrounds and in figures. The inclusion of background details corrected the previously weak Germanic staging of his illustrations. Tenniel's more precisely-designed illustrations depicted specific moments of time, locale, and individual character instead of just generalized scenes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Frankie |title=Artist of Wonderland: The Life, Political Cartoons, and Illustrations of Tenniel |date=2005 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville|page=122}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to a change in specificity of background, Tenniel developed a new interest in human types, expressions, and individualized representation, something that would carry over into Tenniel's illustrations of Wonderland. Referred to by many as theatricalism, this hallmark of Tenniel's style probably stemmed from his earlier interest in caricature. In Tenniel's first years on ''Punch'' he developed this caricaturist's interest in the uniqueness of persons and things, almost giving a human like personality to the objects in the environment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Frankie|title=Artist of Wonderland: The Life, Political Cartoons, and Illustrations of Tenniel |date=2005 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |page=123}}</ref> For example, in a comparison to one of [[John Everett Millais]]'s illustration of a girl in a chair with Tenniel's illustration of Alice in a chair, one can see how where Millais's chair is just a prop, Tenniel's chair possesses a menacing and towering presence.\n\nAnother change in style was his shaded lines. These transformed from mechanical horizontal lines to vigorously hand-drawn hatching that greatly intensified darker areas.\n\n===Grotesque===\nTenniel's \"grotesqueness\" was one of the main reasons why Lewis Carroll wanted Tenniel as his illustrator for the ''Alice'' books. The [[grotesque]] is an abnormality that imparts the disturbing sense that the real world may have ceased to be reliable.<ref name=\"University of Virginia Press\">{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Frankie |title=Artist of Wonderland: The Life, Political Cartoons, and Illustrations of Tenniel |date=2005 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |page=182}}</ref> Tenniel's style was characteristically grotesque in his dark atmospheric compositions of exaggerated fantasy creatures that were carefully drawn in outline.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Engen |first1=Rodney |title=Sir John Tenniel: Alice's White Knight |date=1991 |publisher=Scolar Press |location=Brookfield, VT |page=69}}</ref> Often though, the mechanism was to use animal heads on recognizable human bodies or vice versa, as Grandville had done with such effect in the pages of the Parisian satirical journal, ''Charivari''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Elwyn |title=The Alice Companion: A Guide to Lewis Carroll's Alice Books |date=1998 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |page=251}}</ref> In Tenniel's illustrations, the grotesque is found also in the merging of beings and things, deformities of and violence to the human body (as seen in the illustration when Alice drinks the potion and gets large), a proclivity to deal with the ordinary things of this world while exhibiting such phenomena.<ref name=\"University of Virginia Press\"/> Most notably done in grotesque fashion is that of Tenniel's famous Jabberwock drawing in ''Alice''.\n\nThe ''Alice'' illustrations combine fantasy and reality. Scholars such as Morris say that Tenniel's stylistic change can be attributed to the late 1850s trend towards realism. For the grotesque to operate, \"it is our world which has to be transformed and not some fantasy realm.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Frankie |title=Artist of Wonderland: The Life, Political Cartoons, and Illustrations of Tenniel |date=2005 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |page=189}}</ref> In the illustrations we are constantly but subtly reminded of the real world, such as some of Tenniel's scenes being derived from a medieval town, the portico of Georgian town, or the checked jacket on the white rabbit. Additionally, Tenniel closely follows the text provided by Carroll so readers are ensured that what they are reading, they are seeing in his illustrations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> These subtle points of realism help convince readers that all these seemingly grotesque inhabitants of Wonderland are simply themselves, are simply real, they are not performing.\n\n==Image and text in ''Alice''==\nOne of the most unusual elements of the ''Alice'' books is the placement of Tenniel's illustrations on the pages. There was a physical relation of the illustrations to the text, intended to subtly mesh illustrations with certain points of the text.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hancher |first1=Michael |title=The Tenniel Illustrations to the Alice Books |date=1985 |publisher=Ohio State University Press |location=Columbus |page=120}}</ref> Carroll and Tenniel expressed this in various ways; one of them bracketing. Two relevant sentences would bracket an image, which might better define the moment that Tenniel was trying to illustrate.<ref name=\"Ohio State University Press\">{{cite book |last1=Hancher |first1=Michael |title=The Tenniel Illustrations to the Alice Books |date=1985 |publisher=Ohio State University Press |location=Columbus |page=125}}</ref> It is this precise bracketing of Tenniel's pictures by the text that adds to their \"dramatic immediacy.\"<ref name=\"Ohio State University Press\"/> However, other illustrations work with the texts in that they act as captions, though it is not as frequent as bracketing.\n\nAnother way in which the illustrations correspond with the text is by having broader and narrower illustrations. Broader illustrations are meant to be centered on the page, where as narrower illustrations are meant to be \"let in\" or run flush to the margin to be set alongside a narrowed column of the continuing text.<ref name=\"Ohio State University Press\"/> Still, words run in parallel with the depiction of those things. For example, in this image, we see how when Alice says, \"Oh, my poor little feet\", it not only occurs at the foot of the page but is directly next to her feet in the illustration. Part of these narrower illustrations was the \"L\"-shaped illustration, which was of great importance, being that these are where Tenniel did some of his most memorable work. The top or base of the illustrations would run the full width of the page. but the other end would leave room on one side of the quadrant for the text.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hancher |first1=Michael |title=The Tenniel Illustrations to the Alice Books |date=1985 |publisher=Ohio State University Press |location=Columbus |page=127}}</ref>\n\n==Book illustrations==\nA selected list:\n{{Columns-start}}\n'''Entirely by Tenniel'''\n*''Juvenile Verse and Picture Book'' (1846)<ref name=\"BL\">[http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do;jsessionid=3DBE3F2F904937A138C99F36B82CABA2?fn=search&ct=search&initialSearch=true&mode=Basic&tab=local_tab&indx=1&dum=true&srt=rank&vid=BLVU1&frbg=&tb=t&vl%28freeText0%29=%22John+Tenniel%22&scp.scps=scope%3A%28BLCONTENT%29&vl%28488279563UI0%29=any&vl%28488279563UI0%29=title&vl%28488279563UI0%29=any British Library catalogue search results].

It was the first such honour ever bestowed on an illustrator or cartoonist, and his fellows saw his knighting as gratitude for \"raising what had been a fairly lowly profession to an unprecedented level of respectability\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Sir John Tenniel |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Tenniel    |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>{{cn|date=October 2016}} With knighthood, Tenniel elevated the social status of the black and white illustrator, and sparked a new sense of recognition of his profession.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sir John Tenniel|url=http://www.avictorian.com/Tenniel_John.html|website=avictorian.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>{{cn|date=October 2016}} When he retired in January 1901, Tenniel was honoured with a farewell banquet (12 June), at which [[Arthur James Balfour|AJ Balfour]], then [[Leader of the House of Commons]], presided.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57342183 |title=Artist of Wonderland: the life, political cartoons, and illustrations of Tenniel |last=Frankie |first=Morris, |date=2005 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |others=Tenniel, John, 1820-1914 |year= |isbn=9780813923437 |location=Charlottesville |pages=10 |oclc=57342183}}</ref> \n\nTenniel died in February 25, 1914, just 3 days before his 94th birthday. He was 93 years old.\n\n==Legacy==\n''Punch'' historian [[Marion Spielmann|M. H. Spielmann]], who knew Tenniel, wrote that the political clout contained in his ''Punch'' cartoons was capable of \"swaying parties and people, too... (the cartoons) exercised great influence\" on the ideas of popular reform skirting throughout the British public.{{cn|date=October 2016}} Two days after his death, ''[[The Graphic#The Daily Graphic|The Daily Graphic]]'' recalled Tenniel: \"He had an influence on the political feeling of this time which is hardly measurable ... While Tenniel was drawing them (his subjects), we always looked to the Punch cartoon to crystallize the national and international situation, and the popular feeling about it\u2014and never looked in vain.\"<ref>\"Name of article??\", ''[[The Graphic#The Daily Graphic|The Daily Graphic]]'', 27 February 1914, p. ?</ref>{{page?|date=October 2016}} This condition of social influence resulted from the weekly publishing over a fifty-year span of his political cartoons, whereby Tenniel's fame allowed for a want and need for his particular illustrative work, away from the newspaper. Tenniel became not only one of Victorian Britain's most published illustrators, but as a ''Punch'' cartoonist he became one of the \"supreme social observers\" of British society, and an integral component of a powerful journalistic force.{{cn|date=October 2016}} Also in 1914, the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' journalist George W. Smalley referred to John Tenniel as \"one of the greatest intellectual forces of his time, (who) understood social laws and political energies.\"{{cn|date=October 2016}}\n\nPublic exhibitions of Sir John Tenniel's work were held in 1895 and in 1900.

Oxford University Press, 26 July 2008.</ref>\n\nAs jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to many distinctive styles. [[Dixieland|New Orleans jazz]] began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French [[quadrille]]s, [[biguine]], ragtime and [[blues]] with collective [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[improvisation]]. In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented [[Swing (music)|swing]] [[big band]]s, [[Kansas City jazz]], a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and [[Gypsy jazz]] (a style that emphasized [[Bal-musette|musette]] waltzes) were the prominent styles. [[Bebop]] emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music\" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. [[Cool jazz]] developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.\n\nThe 1950s saw the emergence of [[free jazz]], which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures, and in the mid-1950s, [[hard bop]] emerged, which introduced influences from [[rhythm and blues]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. [[Modal jazz]] developed in the late 1950s, using the [[musical mode|mode]], or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. [[Jazz fusion|Jazz-rock fusion]] appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with [[rock music]]'s rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called [[smooth jazz]] became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as [[Latin jazz|Latin]] and [[Afro-Cuban jazz]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== <span id=\"Definition\"></span> Etymology and definition==\n{{Main|Jazz (word)}}\n[[File:EubieBlake.jpg|thumb|right|American jazz composer, lyricist, and pianist [[Eubie Blake]] made an early contribution to the genre's etymology]]\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1915, Composition pour Jazz, oil on cardboard, 73 x 73 cm, Solomon R.

Jazz involves \"a spontaneity and vitality of musical production in which improvisation plays a role\" and contains a \"sonority and manner of phrasing which mirror the individuality of the performing jazz musician\".<ref name=\"Joachim E.

These work songs were commonly structured around a repetitive [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] pattern, but early blues was also improvisational. [[Classical music]] performance is evaluated more by its fidelity to the [[sheet music|musical score]], with less attention given to interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment. The classical performer's goal is to play the composition as it was written. In contrast, jazz is often characterized by the product of interaction and collaboration, placing less value on the contribution of the composer, if there is one, and more on the performer.<ref>Giddins 1998, 70.</ref> The jazz performer interprets a tune in individual ways, never playing the same composition twice. Depending on the performer's mood, experience, and interaction with band members or audience members, the performer may change melodies, harmonies, and time signatures.<ref>Giddins 1998, 89.</ref>\n\nIn early [[Dixieland]], a.k.a. New Orleans jazz, performers took turns playing melodies and improvising [[countermelodies]]. In the [[Swing music|swing]] era of the 1920s\u2013'40s, [[big bands]] relied more on [[arrangements]] which were written or learned by ear and memorized. Soloists improvised within these arrangements. In the [[bebop]] era of the 1940s, big bands gave way to small groups and minimal arrangements in which the melody was stated briefly at the beginning and most of the song was improvised. [[Modal jazz]] abandoned [[chord progressions]] to allow musicians to improvise even more. In many forms of jazz, a soloist is supported by a [[rhythm section]] of one or more chordal instruments (piano, guitar), double bass, and drums. The rhythm section plays chords and rhythms that outline the song structure and complement the soloist.<ref>[http://www.drumbook.org/drum-lessons/jazz-drums/jazz-drumming/ Jazz Drum Lessons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027050049/http://www.drumbook.org/drum-lessons/jazz-drums/jazz-drumming/ |date=2010-10-27 }} \u2013 Drumbook.org</ref> In [[avant-garde jazz|avant-garde]] and [[free jazz]], the separation of soloist and band is reduced, and there is license, or even a requirement, for the abandoning of chords, scales, and meters.\n\n===Tradition and race===\nSince the emergence of bebop, forms of jazz that are commercially oriented or influenced by popular music have been criticized.

Handy]] became intrigued by the folk blues of the Deep South whilst traveling through the Mississippi Delta. In this folk blues form, the singer would improvise freely within a limited melodic range, sounding like a field holler, and the guitar accompaniment was slapped rather than strummed, like a small drum which responded in syncopated accents, functioning as another \"voice\".<ref>Palmer (1981: 46).</ref> Handy and his band members were formally trained African-American musicians who had not grown up with the blues, yet he was able to adapt the blues to a larger band instrument format and arrange them in a popular music form.\n\nHandy wrote about his adopting of the blues:\n\n<blockquote>The primitive southern Negro, as he sang, was sure to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale, slurring between major and minor. Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, it was always the same. Till then, however, I had never heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by any white man. I tried to convey this effect ... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into my song, although its prevailing key was major ..., and I carried this device into my melody as well.<ref name=\"Handy, Father 1941, p. 99\">Handy, Father (1941), p. 99.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe publication of his \"[[The Memphis Blues|Memphis Blues]]\" sheet music in 1912 introduced the 12-bar blues to the world (although Gunther Schuller argues that it is not really a blues, but \"more like a cakewalk\"<ref>Schuller (1968: 66, 145n.).</ref>).

Handy's music career began in the pre-jazz era and contributed to the codification of jazz through the publication of some of the first jazz sheet music.\n\n====Within the context of Western harmony====\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nThe blues form which is ubiquitous in jazz is characterized by specific chord progressions, of which the [[twelve-bar blues]] progression is the most common. Basic blues progressionions are based on the I, IV and V chords (often called the \"one\", \"four\" and \"five\" chords). An important part of the sound are the microtonal [[blue note]]s which, for expressive purposes, are sung or played flattened (thus \"between\" the notes on a piano), or gradually \"bent\" (minor third to major third) in relation to the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of the [[major scale]]. The blue notes opened up an entirely new approach to Western harmony, ultimately leading to a high level of harmonic complexity in jazz.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===New Orleans===\n{{Main|Dixieland}}\n[[File:Bolden band.gif|thumb|right|[[Buddy Bolden|The Bolden Band]] around 1905]]\nThe [[music of New Orleans]] had a profound effect on the creation of early jazz.

Small bands which mixed self-taught and well-educated African-American musicians, many of whom came from the funeral procession tradition of New Orleans, played a seminal role in the development and dissemination of early jazz. These bands travelled throughout Black communities in the Deep South and, from around 1914 onwards, [[Louisiana Creole people|Afro-Creole]] and African-American musicians played in [[vaudeville]] shows which took jazz to western and northern US cities.<ref name=creoleorch>{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/creole.html|title=Original Creole Orchestra|accessdate=October 23, 2007|publisher=The Red Hot Archive}}</ref>\n[[File:MortonBricktopRowCropMortonFace.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Jelly Roll Morton]], in Los Angeles, California, c. 1917 or 1918]]\nIn New Orleans, a white marching band leader named [[Papa Jack Laine]] integrated blacks and whites in his marching band.

Bix Beiderbecke formed The Wolverines in 1924.\n\nDespite its Southern black origins, there was a larger market for jazzy dance music played by white orchestras. In 1918, [[Paul Whiteman]] and his orchestra became a hit in San Francisco, California, signing with [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1920 and becoming the top bandleader of the 1920s, giving \"hot jazz\" a white component, hiring white musicians including [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Frankie Trumbauer]], and [[Joe Venuti]]. In 1924, Whiteman commissioned [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which was premiered by his orchestra and jazz began to be recognized as a notable musical form. [[Olin Downes]], reviewing the concert in ''The New York Times'': \"This composition shows extraordinary talent, as it shows a young composer with aims that go far beyond those of his ilk, struggling with a form of which he is far from being master.... In spite of all this, he has expressed himself in a significant and, on the whole, highly original form....

February 13, 1924. p. 16.</ref>\n\nAfter Whiteman's band successfully toured Europe, huge hot jazz orchestras in theater pits caught on with other whites, including [[Fred Waring]], [[Jean Goldkette]], and [[Nathaniel Shilkret]]. According to Mario Dunkel, Whiteman's success was based on a \"rhetoric of domestication\" according to which he had elevated and rendered valuable (read \"white\") a previously inchoate (read \"black\") kind of music.<ref>Mario Dunkel, \"W. C.

The original New Orleans style was polyphonic, with theme variation and simultaneous collective improvisation. Armstrong was a master of his hometown style, but by the time he joined Henderson's band, he was already a trailblazer in a new phase of jazz, with its emphasis on arrangements and soloists. Armstrong's solos went well beyond the theme-improvisation concept and extemporized on chords, rather than melodies. According to Schuller, by comparison, the solos by Armstrong's bandmates (including a young [[Coleman Hawkins]]), sounded \"stiff, stodgy,\" with \"jerky rhythms and a grey undistinguished tone quality.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schuller|1968|p=91}}</ref> The following example shows a short excerpt of the straight melody of \"Mandy, Make Up Your Mind\" by [[George W.

After leaving Henderson's group, Armstrong formed his virtuosic [[Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five|Hot Five]] band, where he popularized [[scat singing]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cooke|1999|pp=56\u201359, 78\u201379, 66\u201370}}</ref>\n\nJelly Roll Morton recorded with the [[New Orleans Rhythm Kings]] in an early mixed-race collaboration, then in 1926 formed his [[Red Hot Peppers]].\n\nAlso in the 1920s [[Skiffle]], jazz played with homemade instruments such as washboard, jugs, musical saw, kazoos, etc. began to be recorded in Chicago, later merging with country music.\n\n===Swing in the 1920s and 1930s===\n{{Main|Swing music|1930s in jazz}}\n[[File:BennyGoodmanStageDoorCanteen.jpg|thumb|left|Benny Goodman (1943)]]\nThe 1930s belonged to popular [[swing (music)|swing]] big bands, in which some virtuoso soloists became as famous as the band leaders. Key figures in developing the \"big\" jazz band included bandleaders and arrangers [[Count Basie]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Jimmy Dorsey|Jimmy]] and [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Earl Hines]], [[Harry James]], [[Jimmie Lunceford]], [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Artie Shaw]]. Although it was a collective sound, swing also offered individual musicians a chance to \"solo\" and improvise melodic, thematic solos which could at times be very complex \"important\" music.\n\nSwing was also dance music. It was broadcast on the radio \"live\" nightly across America for many years, especially by Earl Hines and his [[Grand Terrace Cafe]] Orchestra broadcasting coast-to-coast from Chicago<ref>See lengthy interviews with Hines in [Nairn] ''Earl \"Fatha\" Hines'': [https://vimeo.com/58414566] \u2013 see External Links below.</ref> (well placed for \"live\" US time-zones).\n\nOver time, social strictures regarding racial segregation began to relax in America: white bandleaders began to recruit black musicians and black bandleaders white ones. In the mid-1930s, Benny Goodman hired pianist [[Teddy Wilson]], vibraphonist [[Lionel Hampton]] and guitarist [[Charlie Christian]] to join small groups. In the 1930s, Kansas City Jazz as exemplified by tenor saxophonist [[Lester Young]] marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or [[jump blues]] used small combos, uptempo music and blues chord progressions, drawing on [[boogie woogie (music)|boogie-woogie]] from the 1930s.\n\n===\"American music\"\u2014the influence of Ellington===\n[[File:Duke Ellington at the Hurricane Club 1943.jpg|thumb|upright|Duke Ellington at the Hurricane Club (1943)]]\n\nWhile swing was reaching the height of its popularity, [[Duke Ellington]] spent the late 1920s and 1930s developing an innovative musical idiom for his orchestra. Abandoning the conventions of swing, he experimented with orchestral sounds, harmony, and [[musical form]] with complex compositions that still translated well for popular audiences; some of his tunes became [[hit single|hits]], and his own popularity spanned from the United States to Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=van de Leur|first=Walter|chapter=12 \"Seldom seen, but always heard\": Billy Strayhorn and Duke Ellington|title=The Cambridge Companion to Duke Ellington|editor-last=Green|editor-first=Edward|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=1316194132|year=2015}}</ref>\n\nEllington called his music \"American Music\" rather than jazz, and liked to describe those who impressed him as \"beyond category.\"<ref name=\"Tucker-1\">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1995|p=6}} writes \"He tried to avoid the word 'jazz' preferring 'Negro' or 'American' music.

He often composed specifically for the style and skills of these individuals, such as \"Jeep's Blues\" for [[Johnny Hodges]], \"Concerto for Cootie\" for [[Cootie Williams]] (which later became \"[[Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me]]\" with [[Bob Russell (songwriter)|Bob Russell]]'s lyrics), and \"The Mooche\" for [[Tricky Sam Nanton]] and [[Bubber Miley]]. He also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, such as [[Juan Tizol]]'s \"[[Caravan (1937 song)|Caravan]]\" and \"[[Perdido (song)|Perdido]]\", which brought the \"Spanish Tinge\" to big-band jazz. Several members of the orchestra remained with him for several decades. The band reached a creative peak in the early 1940s, when Ellington and a small hand-picked group of his composers and arrangers wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices who displayed tremendous creativity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theoryjazz.com/artists/ellington.html |title=Jazz Musicians \u2013 Duke Ellington |publisher=Theory Jazz |accessdate=July 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903233432/http://theoryjazz.com/artists/ellington.html |archivedate=September 3, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Beginnings of European jazz===\nAs only a limited number of American jazz records were released in Europe, European jazz traces many of its roots to American artists such as James Reese Europe, Paul Whiteman, and [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], who visited Europe during and after World War I.

Today, the word 'jazz' is virtually meaningless without further definition.\"<ref name=\"Trynka\"/>}}\n\n===Bebop===\n{{Main|Bebop}}\n{{See also|List of bebop musicians}}\n[[File:Thelonious Monk, Minton's Playhouse, New York, N.Y., ca. Sept. 1947 (William P. Gottlieb 06191).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thelonious Monk]] at Minton's Playhouse, 1947, New York City]]\n[[File:Earl Hines 1947.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Earl Hines 1947]] In the early 1940s, bebop-style performers began to shift jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music.\" The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist [[Charlie Parker]], pianists [[Bud Powell]] and [[Thelonious Monk]], trumpeters [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Clifford Brown]], and drummer [[Max Roach]]. Divorcing itself from dance music, bebop established itself more as an art form, thus lessening its potential popular and commercial appeal.\n\nComposer [[Gunther Schuller]] wrote:\n<blockquote> ... In 1943 I heard the great Earl Hines band which had Bird in it and all those other great musicians. They were playing all the flatted fifth chords and all the modern harmonies and substitutions and Dizzy Gillespie runs in the trumpet section work. Two years later I read that that was 'bop' and the beginning of modern jazz ... but the band never made recordings.<ref>[[Gunther Schuller]] November 14, 1972. Dance, p. 290.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nDizzy Gillespie wrote:\n<blockquote> ... People talk about the Hines band being 'the incubator of bop' and the leading exponents of that music ended up in the Hines band. But people also have the erroneous impression that the music was new. It was not. The music evolved from what went before. It was the same basic music. The difference was in how you got from here to here to here ... naturally each age has got its own shit.<ref>Dance p. 260.</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Rhythm====\nSince bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it could use faster tempos. Drumming shifted to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the [[ride cymbal]] was used to keep time while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This led to a highly syncopated music with a linear rhythmic complexity.<ref name=\"Floyd, Samuel A. 1995\">Floyd, Samuel A., Jr. (1995). ''The Power of Black Music: Interpreting its history from Africa to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\n====Harmony====\n[[File:Charlie Parker, Tommy Potter, Miles Davis, Max Roach (Gottlieb 06941).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Charlie Parker, Tommy Potter, Miles Davis, Max Roach (Gottlieb 06941)]]\nBebop musicians employed several harmonic devices which were not previously typical in jazz, engaging in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation. Bebop scales are traditional scales with an added chromatic passing note;<ref>{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=171}}</ref> bebop also uses \"passing\" chords, [[substitute chord]]s, and [[altered chord]]s. New forms of [[chromaticism]] and [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] were introduced into jazz, and the dissonant [[tritone]] (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\"<ref>Joachim Berendt. ''The Jazz Book'', 1981, p. 15.</ref> Chord progressions for bebop tunes were often taken directly from popular swing-era songs and reused with a new and more complex melody and/or reharmonized with more complex chord progressions to form new compositions, a practice which was already well-established in earlier jazz, but came to be central to the bebop style. Bebop made use of several relatively common chord progressions, such as blues (at base, I-IV-V, but often infused with ii-V motion) and 'rhythm changes' (I-VI-ii-V) - the chords to the 1930s pop standard \"[[I Got Rhythm]].\" Late bop also moved towards extended forms that represented a departure from pop and show tunes.\n\nThe harmonic development in bebop is often traced back to a transcendent moment experienced by Charlie Parker while performing \"Cherokee\" at Clark Monroe's Uptown House, New York, in early 1942:\n<blockquote> I'd been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used, ... and I kept thinking there's bound to be something else. I could hear it sometimes. I couldn't play it.... I was working over 'Cherokee,' and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. It came alive\u2014Parker.<ref>Charlie Parker quoted by Gerhard Kubik (2005). \"Bebop: A Case in Point. The African Matrix in Jazz Harmonic Practices\" (critical essay), ''Black Music Research Journal'' 22 March. Digital.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Gerhard Kubik]] postulates that the harmonic development in bebop sprang from the blues and other [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|African-related tonal sensibilities]], rather than 20th-century Western art music as some have suggested:\n<blockquote> Auditory inclinations were the African legacy in [Parker's] life, reconfirmed by the experience of the blues tonal system, a sound world at odds with the Western diatonic chord categories. Bebop musicians eliminated Western-style functional harmony in their music while retaining the strong central tonality of the blues as a basis for drawing upon various African matrices.<ref>Gerhard Kubik (2005). \"Bebop: A Case in Point. The African Matrix in Jazz Harmonic Practices\" (critical essay), ''Black Music Research Journal'' March 22, Digital.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSamuel Floyd states that blues were both the bedrock and propelling force of bebop, bringing about three main developments:\n* A new harmonic conception, using extended chord structures that led to unprecedented harmonic and melodic variety.\n* A developed and even more highly syncopated, linear rhythmic complexity and a melodic angularity in which the blue note of the fifth degree was established as an important melodic-harmonic device.\n* The reestablishment of the blues as the music's primary organizing and functional principle.<ref name=\"Floyd, Samuel A. 1995\"/>\n\nAs Kubik explained:\n<blockquote>While for an outside observer, the harmonic innovations in bebop would appear to be inspired by experiences in Western \"serious\" music, from [[Claude Debussy]] to [[Arnold Schoenberg]], such a scheme cannot be sustained by the evidence from a cognitive approach. Claude Debussy did have some influence on jazz, for example, on Bix Beiderbecke's piano playing. And it is also true that Duke Ellington adopted and reinterpreted some harmonic devices in European contemporary music. West Coast jazz would run into such debts as would several forms of cool jazz, but bebop has hardly any such debts in the sense of direct borrowings. On the contrary, ideologically, bebop was a strong statement of rejection of any kind of eclecticism, propelled by a desire to activate something deeply buried in self. Bebop then revived tonal-harmonic ideas transmitted through the blues and reconstructed and expanded others in a basically non-Western harmonic approach. The ultimate significance of all this is that the experiments in jazz during the 1940s brought back to [[African-American music]] several structural principles and techniques rooted in African traditions<ref>Kubik (2005).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThese divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time initially met with a divided, sometimes hostile, response among fans and fellow musicians, especially established swing players, who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed to be filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\".<ref>Joachim Berendt. ''The Jazz Book''. 1981, p. 16.</ref> But despite the initial friction, by the 1950s, bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary.\n\n===Afro-Cuban jazz (cu-bop)===\n{{Main|Afro-Cuban jazz}}\n[[File:Machito and his sister Graciella Grillo.jpg|thumb|upright|Machito (maracas) and his sister Graciella Grillo (claves)]]\n\n====Machito and Mario Bauza====\nThe general consensus among musicians and musicologists is that the first original jazz piece to be overtly based in clave was \"Tanga\" (1943), composed by Cuban-born [[Mario Bauza]] and recorded by [[Machito]] and his Afro-Cubans in New York City. \"Tanga\" began as a spontaneous [[descarga]] (Cuban jam session), with jazz solos superimposed on top.<ref>In 1992 Bauza recorded \"Tanga\" in the expanded form of an Afro-Cuban suite, consisting of five movements. ''Mario Bauza and his Afro-Cuban Orchestra''. Messidor CD (1992).</ref>\n\nThis was the birth of [[Afro-Cuban jazz]]. The use of clave brought the African ''timeline'', or ''[[bell pattern|key pattern]]'', into jazz. Music organized around key patterns convey a two-celled (binary) structure, which is a complex level of African [[cross beat|cross-rhythm]].<ref>{{harvnb|Pe\u00f1alosa|2010|p=56}}</ref> Within the context of jazz, however, harmony is the primary referent, not rhythm. The harmonic progression can begin on either side of clave, and the harmonic \"one\" is always understood to be \"one\". If the progression begins on the \"three-side\" of clave, it is said to be in ''3-2 clave''. If the progression begins on the \"two-side\", its in ''2-3 clave''.<ref>{{harvnb|Pe\u00f1alosa|2010|pp=131\u2013136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kpanlogo bell.jpg|thumb|center|upright=1.8|Clave: Spanish for 'code,' or key,' as in the key to a puzzle. The antecedent half (three-side) consists of tresillo. The consequent half consists of two strokes (the two-side). {{audio|3-2 son clave.mid|Play}}]]\n\n[[Bobby Sanabria]] mentions several innovations of Machito's Afro-Cubans, citing them as the first band: to wed big band jazz arranging techniques within an original composition, with jazz oriented soloists utilizing an authentic Afro-Cuban based rhythm section in a successful manner; to explore modal harmony (a concept explored much later by [[Miles Davis]] and [[Gil Evans]]) from a jazz arranging perspective; and to overtly explore the concept of clave counterpoint from an arranging standpoint (the ability to weave seamlessly from one side of the clave to the other without breaking its rhythmic integrity within the structure of a musical arrangement). They were also the first band in the United States to use the term \"Afro-Cuban\" as the band's moniker, thus identifying itself and acknowledging the West African roots of the musical form they were playing. It forced New York City's Latino and African-American communities to deal with their common West African musical roots in a direct way, whether they wanted to acknowledge it publicly or not.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\n====Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo====\n[[File:Dizzy Gillespie playing horn 1955.jpg|thumb|upright|Dizzy Gillespie, 1955]]\n[[Mario Bauz\u00e1]] introduced bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to Cuban conga drummer and composer [[Chano Pozo]]. Gillespie and Pozo's brief collaboration produced some of the most enduring Afro-Cuban jazz standards. \"[[Manteca (song)|Manteca]]\" (1947) is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave. According to Gillespie, Pozo composed the layered, contrapuntal [[guajeo]]s (Afro-Cuban [[ostinato]]s) of the A section and the introduction, while Gillespie wrote the bridge. Gillespie recounted: \"If I'd let it go like [Chano] wanted it, it would have been strictly Afro-Cuban all the way. There wouldn't have been a bridge. I thought I was writing an eight-bar bridge, but...I had to keep going and ended up writing a sixteen-bar bridge.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=Dizzy Gillespie, with Al|title=To Be or Not to Bop: Memoirs of Dizzy Gillespie|date=March 1, 1985|publisher=Da Capo Press| location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0306802362|page=77|title-link=To Be or Not to Bop: Memoirs of Dizzy Gillespie}}</ref> The bridge gave \"Manteca\" a typical jazz harmonic structure, setting the piece apart from Bauza's modal \"Tanga\" of a few years earlier.\n\nGillespie's collaboration with Pozo brought specific African-based rhythms into bebop. While pushing the boundaries of harmonic improvisation, ''cu-bop'' also drew from African rhythm. Jazz arrangements with a Latin A section and a swung B section, with all choruses swung during solos, became common practice with many Latin tunes of the jazz standard repertoire. This approach can be heard on pre-1980 recordings of \"Manteca\", \"[[A Night in Tunisia]]\", \"Tin Tin Deo\", and \"[[On Green Dolphin Street (song)|On Green Dolphin Street]]\".\n\n====African cross-rhythm====\n[[File:Mongo Santamaria 1969.JPG|thumb|upright|Mongo Santamaria (1969)]]\nCuban percussionist [[Mongo Santamaria]] first recorded his composition \"[[Afro Blue]]\" in 1959.<ref>\"Afro Blue\", ''Afro Roots'' (Mongo Santamaria) Prestige CD 24018-2 (1959).</ref>\n\"Afro Blue\" was the first jazz standard built upon a typical African three-against-two (3:2) [[cross-rhythm]], or [[hemiola]].<ref>{{harvnb|Pe\u00f1alosa|2010|p=26}}</ref> The song begins with the bass repeatedly playing 6 cross-beats per each measure of 12/8, or 6 cross-beats per 4 main beats\u20146:4 (two cells of 3:2). The following example shows the original ostinato \"Afro Blue\" bass line; the slashed noteheads indicate the main beats (not bass notes), where you would normally tap your foot to keep time.\n\n[[File:Afro blue bass.jpg|thumb|center|upright=1.75|\"Afro Blue\" bass line, with main beats indicated by slashed noteheads.]]\nWhen [[John Coltrane]] covered \"Afro Blue\" in 1963, he inverted the metric hierarchy, interpreting the tune as a 3/4 jazz waltz with duple cross-beats superimposed (2:3). Originally a B{{music|flat}} [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] blues, Coltrane expanded the harmonic structure of \"Afro Blue.\"\n\nPerhaps the most respected [[Afro-cuban jazz]] combo of the late 1950s was vibraphonist [[Cal Tjader]]'s band. Tjader had [[Mongo Santamaria]], [[Armando Peraza]], and [[Willie Bobo]] on his early recording dates.\n\n===Dixieland revival===\nIn the late 1940s, there was a revival of [[Dixieland]], harking back to the contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two types of musicians involved in the revival: the first group was made up of those who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style and were returning to it (or continuing what they had been playing all along), such as [[Bob Crosby]]'s Bobcats, [[Max Kaminsky (musician)|Max Kaminsky]], [[Eddie Condon]], and [[Wild Bill Davison]].<ref name=\"Collier, 1978\">Collier, 1978.</ref> Most of these players were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second group of revivalists consisted of younger musicians, such as those in the [[Lu Watters]] band, [[Conrad Janis]], and [[Ward Kimball]] and his [[Firehouse Five Plus Two]] Jazz Band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.<ref name=\"Collier, 1978\"/>\n\n===Cool jazz and West Coast jazz===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\n{{main|Cool jazz}}\n[[File:JATP 1955.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Jazz at the Philharmonic announcement, 1956]]\n\nIn 1944, jazz impresario [[Norman Granz]] organized the first [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]] concert in Los Angeles, which helped make a star of [[Nat \"King\" Cole]] and [[Les Paul]]. In 1946, he founded [[Clef Records]], discovering Canadian jazz pianist [[Oscar Peterson]] in 1949, and merging Clef Records with his new label [[Verve Records]] in 1956, which advanced the career of [[Ella Fitzgerald]] et al.\n\nBy the end of the 1940s, the nervous energy and tension of bebop was replaced with a tendency toward calm and smoothness with the sounds of [[cool jazz]], which favored long, linear melodic lines. It emerged in New York City and dominated jazz in the first half of the 1950s. The starting point was a collection of 1949 and 1950 singles by a [[nonet (music)|nonet]] led by [[Miles Davis]], released as the ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' (1957). Later cool jazz recordings by musicians such as [[Chet Baker]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Bill Evans]], [[Gil Evans]], [[Stan Getz]], the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]], and [[Gerry Mulligan]] usually had a lighter sound that avoided the aggressive tempos and harmonic abstraction of bebop.\n\nCool jazz later became strongly identified with the [[West Coast jazz]] scene, as typified by singers Chet Baker, [[Mel Torm\u00e9]], and [[Anita O'Day]], but it also had a particular resonance in Europe, especially Scandinavia, where figures such as baritone saxophonist [[Lars Gullin]] and pianist [[Bengt Hallberg]] emerged. The theoretical underpinnings of cool jazz were laid out by the Chicago pianist [[Lennie Tristano]], and its influence stretches into such later developments as [[bossa nova]], [[modal jazz]], and even free jazz.\n\n{{listen\n|image = none\n|filename    = DukeEllington_TakeTheATrain.ogg\n|title       = \"Take The 'A' Train\"\n|description = This 1941 sample of Duke Ellington's signature tune is an example of the swing style.\n|format      = [[Ogg]]\n|image4 = none\n|filename4    = CharlieParker_YardbirdSuite.ogg\n|title4       = \"Yardbird Suite\"\n|description4 = Excerpt from a saxophone solo by Charlie Parker.

Hard bop was developed in the mid-1950s, coalescing in 1953 and 1954; it developed partly in response to the vogue for cool jazz in the early 1950s and paralleled the rise of rhythm and blues. Miles Davis' 1954 performance of \"Walkin'\" at the first [[Newport Jazz Festival]] announced the style to the jazz world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Natambu|first1=Kofi|title=Miles Davis: A New Revolution in Sound|journal=Black Renaissance/Renaissance Noire|date=2014|volume=2|page=39}}</ref> The quintet Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, fronted by [[Art Blakey|Blakey]] and featuring pianist [[Horace Silver]] and trumpeter [[Clifford Brown]], were leaders in the hard bop movement along with Davis.\n\n===Modal jazz===\n{{Main|Modal jazz}}\nModal jazz is a development which began in the later 1950s which takes the [[musical mode|mode]], or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. Previously, a solo was meant to fit into a given [[chord progression]], but with modal jazz, the soloist creates a melody using one (or a small number of) modes. The emphasis is thus shifted from harmony to melody:<ref>{{harvnb|Litweiler|1984|pp=110\u2013111}}</ref> \"Historically, this caused a seismic shift among jazz musicians, away from thinking vertically (the chord), and towards a more horizontal approach (the scale),\"<ref>{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=30}}</ref> explained pianist [[Mark Levine (musician)|Mark Levine]].\n\nThe modal theory stems from a work by [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]]. Miles Davis introduced the concept to the greater jazz world with ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959), an exploration of the possibilities of modal jazz which would become the best selling jazz album of all time. In contrast to Davis' earlier work with hard bop and its complex chord progression and improvisation, ''Kind of Blue'' was composed as a series of modal sketches in which the musicians were given scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yudkin|first1=Jeremy|title=The Naming of Names: \"Flamenco Sketches\" or \"All Blues\"? Identifying the Last Two Tracks on Miles Davis's Classic Album Kind of Blue|journal=Musical Quarterly|date=2012|volume=95|issue=1|pages=15\u201335}}</ref>\n\n\"I didn't write out the music for ''Kind of Blue'', but brought in sketches for what everybody was supposed to play because I wanted a lot of spontaneity,\"<ref>Davis, Miles (1989: 234). ''The Autobiography''. New York: Touchstone.</ref> recalled Davis. The track \"So What\" has only two chords: [[dominant seventh chord|D-7]] and E{{music|b}}-7.<ref>{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=29}}</ref>\n\nOther innovators in this style include [[Jackie McLean]],<ref>{{harvnb|Litweiler|1984|pp=120\u2013123}}</ref> and two of the musicians who had also played on ''Kind of Blue'': John Coltrane and Bill Evans.\n\nBy the 1950s, Afro-Cuban jazz had been using modes for at least a decade, as much of it borrowed from Cuban popular dance forms which are structured around multiple ostinatos with only a few chords. A case in point is [[Mario Bauza]]'s \"Tanga\" (1943), the first Afro-Cuban jazz piece. Machito's Afro-Cubans recorded modal tunes in the 1940s, featuring jazz soloists such as [[Howard McGhee]], [[Brew Moore]], Charlie Parker, and [[Flip Phillips]]. However, there is no evidence that Davis or other mainstream jazz musicians were influenced by the use of modes in Afro-Cuban jazz, or other branches of [[Latin jazz]].{{clarify|those soloists played, but were not influenced? Or the other way round?|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Free jazz===\n{{Main|Free jazz}}\n[[File:John Coltrane 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|John Coltrane, 1963]]\nFree jazz, and the related form of [[avant-garde jazz]], broke through into an open space of \"free tonality\" in which meter, beat, and formal symmetry all disappeared, and a range of [[world music]] from India, Africa, and Arabia were melded into an intense, even religiously ecstatic or orgiastic style of playing.<ref>Joachim Berendt. ''The Jazz Book''. 1981. Page 21.</ref> While loosely inspired by bebop, free jazz tunes gave players much more latitude; the loose harmony and tempo was deemed controversial when this approach was first developed. The bassist [[Charles Mingus]] is also frequently associated with the avant-garde in jazz, although his compositions draw from myriad styles and genres.\n\nThe first major stirrings came in the 1950s with the early work of [[Ornette Coleman]] (whose 1960 album ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation]]'' coined the term) and [[Cecil Taylor]]. In the 1960s, exponents included [[Albert Ayler]], [[Gato Barbieri]], [[Carla Bley]], [[Don Cherry]], [[Larry Coryell]], [[John Coltrane]], [[Bill Dixon]], [[Jimmy Giuffre]], [[Steve Lacy]], [[Michael Mantler]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Roswell Rudd]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], and [[John Tchicai]]. In developing his late style, Coltrane was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler's trio with bassist [[Gary Peacock]] and drummer [[Sunny Murray]], a rhythm section honed with [[Cecil Taylor]] as leader. In November 1961, Coltrane played a gig at the Village Vanguard, which resulted in the classic ''Chasin' the 'Trane'', which ''Down Beat'' magazine panned as \"anti-jazz\". On his 1961 tour of France, he was booed, but persevered, signing with the new [[Impulse! Records]] in 1960 and turning it into \"the house that Trane built\", while championing many younger free jazz musicians, notably [[Archie Shepp]], who often played with trumpeter [[Bill Dixon]], who organized the 4-day \"October Revolution in Jazz\" in Manhattan in 1964, the first free jazz festival.\n\nA series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming increasingly abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like [[multiphonics]], utilization of overtones, and playing in the [[altissimo]] register, as well as a mutated return to Coltrane's [[sheets of sound]]. In the studio, he all but abandoned his soprano to concentrate on the tenor saxophone. In addition, the quartet responded to the leader by playing with increasing freedom.  The group's evolution can be traced through the recordings ''[[The John Coltrane Quartet Plays]]'', ''[[Living Space (album)|Living Space]]'' and ''[[Transition (John Coltrane album)|Transition]]'' (both June 1965), ''[[New Thing at Newport]]'' (July 1965), ''[[Sun Ship]]'' (August 1965), and ''[[First Meditations]]'' (September 1965).\n\nIn June 1965, Coltrane and 10 other musicians recorded ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'', a 40-minute-long piece without breaks that included adventurous solos by young avante-garde musicians as well as Coltrane, and was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. [[Dave Liebman]] later called it \"the torch that lit the free jazz thing.\".  After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited Pharoah Sanders to join the band in September 1965.  While Coltrane used over-blowing frequently as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders would opt to overblow his entire solo, resulting in a constant screaming and screeching in the altissimo range of the instrument.\n\n====Free jazz in Europe====\n[[File:Peter-broetzmann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A shot from a 2006 performance by [[Peter Br\u00f6tzmann]], a key figure in European free jazz]]\nFree jazz quickly found a foothold in Europe, in part because musicians such as Ayler, Taylor, [[Steve Lacy]] and [[Eric Dolphy]] spent extended periods there, and European musicians [[Michael Mantler]], [[John Tchicai]] et al. traveled to the U.S. to experience American approaches firsthand. A distinctive European contemporary jazz (sometimes incorporating elements of free jazz but not limited to it) flourished because of the emergence of highly distinctive European or European-based musicians such as [[Peter Br\u00f6tzmann]], [[John Surman]], [[Krzysztof Komeda]], [[Zbigniew Namys\u0142owski]], [[Tomasz Stanko]], [[Lars Gullin]], [[Joe Harriott]], [[Albert Mangelsdorff]], [[Kenny Wheeler]], [[Graham Collier]], [[Michael Garrick]] and [[Mike Westbrook]], who were anxious to develop new approaches reflecting their national and regional musical cultures and contexts.  Since the 1960s, various creative centers of jazz have developed in Europe, such as the creative jazz scene in Amsterdam.  Following the work of veteran drummer [[Han Bennink]] and pianist [[Misha Mengelberg]], musicians started to explore free music by collectively improvising until a certain form (melody, rhythm, or even famous song) is found by the band.  Jazz critic [[Kevin Whitehead]] documented the free jazz scene in Amsterdam and some of its main exponents such as the ICP (Instant Composers Pool) orchestra in his book ''New Dutch Swing''.  Since the 1990s [[Keith Jarrett]] has been prominent in defending free jazz from criticism by traditionalists. British scholar Stuart Nicholson<ref>Stuart Nicholson, ''Is Jazz Dead? Or Has it Moved to a New Address'' (NY: Routledge, 2005).</ref> has been prominent in arguing that European contemporary jazz's identity is now substantially independent of American jazz and follows a different trajectory.\n\n===Latin jazz===\n{{Main|Latin jazz}}\nLatin jazz is the term used to describe jazz which employs Latin American rhythms and is generally understood to have a more specific meaning than simply jazz from Latin America. A more precise term might be Afro-Latin jazz, as the jazz subgenre typically employs rhythms that either have a direct analog in Africa or exhibit an African rhythmic influence beyond what is ordinarily heard in other jazz. The two main categories of Latin jazz are [[Afro-Cuban jazz]] and Brazilian jazz.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, many jazz musicians had only a basic understanding of Cuban and Brazilian music, and jazz compositions which used Cuban or Brazilian elements were often referred to as \"Latin tunes\", with no distinction between a Cuban [[son montuno]] and a Brazilian [[bossa nova]]. Even as late as 2000, in Mark Gridley's ''Jazz Styles: History and Analysis'', a bossa nova bass line is referred to as a \"Latin bass figure.\"<ref>Gridley, Mark C. (2000: 444). ''Jazz Styles: History and Analysis'', 7th ed.</ref> It was not uncommon during the 1960s and 1970s to hear a conga playing a Cuban [[tumbao]] while the drumset and bass played a Brazilian bossa nova pattern. Many jazz standards such as \"Manteca\", \"On Green Dolphin Street\" and \"Song for My Father\" have a \"Latin\" A section and a swung B section. Typically, the band would only play an even-eighth \"Latin\" feel in the A section of the head and swing throughout all of the solos. Latin jazz specialists like [[Cal Tjader]] tended to be the exception. For example, on a 1959 live Tjader recording of \"A Night in Tunisia\", pianist [[Vince Guaraldi]] soloed through the entire form over an authentic [[mambo (music)|mambo]].<ref>Tjader, Cal (1959). ''Monterey Concerts''. Prestige CD. ASIN: B000000ZCY.</ref>\n\n====Afro-Cuban jazz====\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\n{{Main|Afro-Cuban jazz}}\nAfro-Cuban jazz often uses Afro-Cuban instruments such as [[conga]]s, [[timbales]], [[g\u00fciro]], and [[claves]], combined with piano, double bass, etc. Afro-Cuban jazz began with Machito's Afro-Cubans in the early 1940s, but took off and entered the mainstream in the late 1940s when bebop musicians such as [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Billy Taylor]] began experimenting with Cuban rhythms. [[Mongo Santamaria]] and [[Cal Tjader]] further refined the genre in the late 1950s.\n\nAlthough a great deal of Cuban-based Latin jazz is modal, Latin jazz is not always modal: it can be as harmonically expansive as post-bop jazz. For example, [[Tito Puente]] recorded an arrangement of \"Giant Steps\" done to an Afro-Cuban [[guaguanc\u00f3]]. A Latin jazz piece may momentarily contract harmonically, as in the case of a percussion solo over a one or two-chord piano guajeo.\n\n=====Guajeos=====\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\n[[Guajeo]] is the name for the typical Afro-Cuban ostinato melodies which are commonly used motifs in Latin jazz compositions. They originated in the genre known as [[son (music)|son]]. Guajeos provide a rhythmic and melodic framework that may be varied within certain parameters, whilst still maintaining a repetitive - and thus \"danceable\" - structure. Most guajeos are rhythmically based on [[clave (rhythm)]].\n\nGuajeos are one of the most important elements of the vocabulary of Afro-Cuban [[descarga]] (jazz-inspired instrumental jams), providing a means of tension and resolution and a sense of forward momentum, within a relatively simple harmonic structure. The use of multiple, contrapuntal guajeos in Latin jazz facilitates simultaneous collective improvisation based on theme variation. In a way, this polyphonic texture is reminiscent of the original New Orleans style of jazz.\n\n=====Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance=====\nFor most of its history, Afro-Cuban jazz had been a matter of superimposing jazz phrasing over Cuban rhythms. But by the end of the 1970s, a new generation of New York City musicians had emerged who were fluent in both [[salsa (music)|salsa]] dance music and jazz, leading to a new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms. This era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers Jerry (congas and trumpet) and Andy (bass).<ref>Andy Gonzalez interviewed by Larry Birnbaum. Ed. Boggs, Vernon W. (1992: 297\u2013298). ''Salsiology; Afro-Cuban Music and the Evolution of Salsa in New York City''. New York: Greenwood Press. {{ISBN|0-313-28468-7}}</ref> During 1974\u20131976, they were members of one of [[Eddie Palmieri]]'s most experimental salsa groups: salsa was the medium, but Palmieri was stretching the form in new ways. He incorporated parallel fourths, with McCoy Tyner-type vamps. The innovations of Palmieri, the Gonzalez brothers and others led to an Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance in New York City.\n\nThis occurred in parallel with developments in Cuba<ref>Acosta, Leonardo (2003). ''Cubano Be, Cubano Bop: One Hundred Years of Jazz in Cuba'', p. 59. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books. {{ISBN|1-58834-147-X}}</ref> The first Cuban band of this new wave was [[Irakere]]. Their \"Ch\u00e9kere-son\" (1976) introduced a style of \"Cubanized\" bebop-flavored horn lines that departed from the more angular guajeo-based lines which were typical of Cuban popular music and Latin jazz up until that time. It was based on Charlie Parker's composition \"Billie's Bounce\", jumbled together in a way that fused clave and bebop horn lines.<ref>Moore, Kevin (2007) \"History and Discography of Irakere\". [http://www.timba.com/encyclopedia_pages/history-and-discography-of-irakere ''Timba.com''.]</ref> In spite of the ambivalence of some band members towards Irakere's Afro-Cuban folkloric / jazz fusion, their experiments forever changed Cuban jazz: their innovations are still heard in the high level of harmonic and rhythmic complexity in Cuban jazz and in the jazzy and complex contemporary form of popular dance music known as [[timba]].\n\n====Afro-Brazilian jazz====\n[[File:Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos.jpg|thumb|upright|Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos playing the Afro-Brazilian [[Berimbau]]]]\n\nBrazilian jazz such as [[bossa nova]] is derived from [[samba]], with influences from jazz and other 20th-century classical and popular music styles. Bossa is generally moderately paced, with melodies sung in Portuguese or English, whilst the related term jazz-samba describes an adaptation of street samba into jazz.\n\nThe bossa nova style was pioneered by Brazilians [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]] and [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]] and was made popular by [[Elizete Cardoso]]'s recording of \"[[Chega de Saudade]]\" on the ''[[Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Amor Demais]]'' LP. Gilberto's initial releases, and the 1959 film ''[[Black Orpheus]]'', achieved significant popularity in [[Latin America]]; this spread to North America via visiting American jazz musicians. The resulting recordings by [[Charlie Byrd]] and Stan Getz cemented bossa nova's popularity and led to a worldwide boom, with 1963's ''[[Getz/Gilberto]]'', numerous recordings by famous jazz performers such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], and the eventual entrenchment of the bossa nova style as a lasting influence in world music.\n\nBrazilian percussionists such as [[Airto Moreira]] and [[Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos]] also influenced jazz internationally by introducing Afro-Brazilian folkloric instruments and rhythms into a wide variety of jazz styles, thus attracting a greater audience to them.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yanow|first=Scott|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p36965/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Airto Moreira|publisher=AllMusic|date=August 5, 1941|accessdate=2011-10-22}}</ref><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p6300/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic Biography]</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Palmer|first=Robert|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E6DF123BF93BA15755C0A964948260|title=Jazz Festival - Jazz Festival - A Study Of Folk-Jazz Fusion - Review|publisher=''New York Times''|date=1982-06-28|accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>\n\n===Post-bop===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\n{{Main|Post-bop}}\n[[File:Bill Evans.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Bill Evans at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] with [[Marc Johnson (musician)|Marc Johnson]] on bass and [[Philly Joe Jones]] on drums, July 13, 1978]]\nPost-bop jazz is a form of small-combo jazz derived from earlier bop styles. The genre's origins lie in seminal work by John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Bill Evans, Charles Mingus, [[Wayne Shorter]], and [[Herbie Hancock]]. Generally, the term post-bop is taken to mean jazz from the mid-sixties onwards that assimilates influences from [[hard bop]], [[modal jazz]], the [[avant-garde jazz|avant-garde]] and free jazz, without necessarily being immediately identifiable as any of the above.\n\nMuch post-bop was recorded for [[Blue Note Records]]. Key albums include ''[[Speak No Evil]]'' by Shorter; ''[[The Real McCoy (album)|The Real McCoy]]'' by [[McCoy Tyner]]; ''[[Maiden Voyage (Herbie Hancock album)|Maiden Voyage]]'' by Hancock; ''[[Miles Smiles]]'' by Davis; and ''[[Search for the New Land]]'' by [[Lee Morgan]] (an artist who is not typically associated with the post-bop genre). Most post-bop artists worked in other genres as well, with a particularly strong overlap with the earlier [[hard bop]].\n\n===Soul jazz===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\n{{Main|Soul jazz}}\nSoul jazz was a development of [[hard bop]] which incorporated strong influences from [[blues]], [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[rhythm and blues]] to create music for small groups, often the [[organ trio]] of [[Hammond organ]], drummer and tenor saxophonist. Unlike [[hard bop]], soul jazz generally emphasized repetitive [[Groove (music)|grooves]] and melodic hooks, and [[improvisation]]s were often less complex than in other jazz styles. It often had a steadier \"funk\" style groove, which was different from the swing rhythms typical of much hard bop.\n\n[[Horace Silver]] had a large influence on the soul jazz style, with songs that used funky and often [[Gospel music|gospel]]-based piano [[Vamp (music)|vamps]]. Important soul jazz organists included [[Jimmy McGriff]], [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]] and [[Johnny Hammond Smith]], and influential tenor [[saxophone]] players included [[Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis]] and [[Stanley Turrentine]].\n\n===African-inspired===\n[[File:Randy Weston.jpg|thumb|upright|Randy Weston]]\n\n====Themes====\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nThere was a resurgence of interest in jazz and other forms of African-American cultural expression during the [[Black Arts Movement]] and [[Black nationalism|Black nationalist]] period of the 1960s and 1970s. African themes became popular, and many new jazz compositions were given African-related titles: \"Black Nile\" ([[Wayne Shorter]]), \"Blue Nile\" ([[Alice Coltrane]]), \"Obirin African\" ([[Art Blakey]]), \"Zambia\" ([[Lee Morgan]]), \"Appointment in Ghana\" ([[Jackie McLean]]), \"Marabi\" ([[Cannonball Adderley]]), \"Yoruba\" ([[Hubert Laws]]), and many more. Pianist [[Randy Weston]]'s music incorporated African elements, such as in the large-scale suite \"Uhuru Africa\" (with the participation of poet [[Langston Hughes]]) and \"Highlife: Music From the New African Nations.\" Both Weston and saxophonist [[Stanley Turrentine]] covered the Nigerian [[Bobby Benson]]'s piece \"Niger Mambo\", which features Afro-Caribbean and jazz elements within a West African [[Highlife]] style. Some musicians, including [[Pharoah Sanders]], [[Hubert Laws]], and [[Wayne Shorter]], began using African instruments such as [[kalimbas]], bells, beaded [[gourds]] and other instruments which were not traditional to jazz.\n\n====Rhythm====\nDuring this period, there was an increased use of the typical African 12/8 [[cross beat|cross-rhythmic]] structure in jazz. [[Herbie Hancock]]'s \"Succotash\" on ''[[Inventions and Dimensions]]'' (1963) is an open-ended modal 12/8 improvised jam, in which Hancock's pattern of attack-points, rather than the pattern of pitches, is the primary focus of his improvisations, accompanied by [[Paul Chambers]] on bass, percussionist Osvaldo Martinez playing a traditional Afro-Cuban cheker\u00e9 part and [[Willie Bobo]] playing an [[Abaku\u00e1]] bell pattern on a snare drum with brushes.\n\nThe first [[jazz standard]] composed by a non-Latino to use an overt African 12/8 cross-rhythm was [[Wayne Shorter]]'s \"[[Footprints (composition)|Footprints]]\" (1967).<ref>\"Footprints\" ''Miles Smiles'' (Miles Davis). Columbia CD (1967).</ref> On the version recorded on ''Miles Smiles'' by [[Miles Davis]], the bass switches to a 4/4 [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]] figure at 2:20. \"Footprints\" is not, however, a [[Latin jazz]] tune: African rhythmic structures are accessed directly by [[Ron Carter]] (bass) and [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] (drums) via the rhythmic sensibilities of [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swing]]. Throughout the piece, the four beats, whether sounded or not, are maintained as the temporal referent. In the example below, the main beats are indicated by slashed noteheads, which do not indicate bass notes.\n\n[[File:FOOTPRINTS BASS LINES.tif|thumb|center|upright=1.8|[[Ron Carter|Ron Carter's]] two main [[basslines]] for \"Footprints\" by [[Wayner Shorter]] (1967). The main beats are indicated by slashed noteheads.]]\n\n====Pentatonic scales====\nThe use of [[pentatonic scale]]s was another trend associated with Africa. The use of pentatonic scales in Africa probably goes back thousands of years.<ref>An ancient west central Sudanic stratum of ''pentatonic'' song composition, often associated with simple work rhythms in a regular meter, but with notable off-beat accents ... reaches back perhaps thousands of years to early West African sorgum agriculturalists\u2014Kubik, Gerhard (1999: 95). ''Africa and the Blues''. Jackson, MI: University Press of Mississippi.</ref>\n\n[[McCoy Tyner]] perfected the use of the pentatonic scale in his solos,<ref>Gridley, Mark C. (2000: 270). ''Jazz Styles: History and Analysis'', 7th ed.</ref> and also used parallel fifths and fourths, which are common harmonies in West Africa.<ref>Map showing distribution of harmony in Africa. Jones, A.M. (1959). ''Studies in African Music.'' Oxford Press.</ref>\n\nThe minor pentatonic scale is often used in blues improvisation, and like a blues scale, a minor pentatonic scale can be played over all of the chords in a blues. The following pentatonic lick was played over blues changes by [[Joe Henderson]] on [[Horace Silver]]'s \"African Queen\" (1965).<ref>{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=235}}</ref>\n\nJazz pianist, theorist, and educator [[Mark Levine (musician)|Mark Levine]] refers to the scale generated by beginning on the fifth step of a pentatonic scale as the ''V pentatonic scale''.<ref>Levine, Mark (1989: 127). ''The Jazz Piano Book''. Petaluma, CA: Sher Music. ASIN: B004532DEE</ref>\n\n[[File:I IV V pentatonic.tiff|thumb|center|upright=2.05|C pentatonic scale beginning on the I (C pentatonic), IV (F pentatonic), and V (G pentatonic) steps of the scale.{{clarify|date=August 2012}}<!--the text above says the fifth step of a pentatonic scale, but this shows the fifth step of the C major diatonic scale-->]]\n\nLevine points out that the V pentatonic scale works for all three chords of the standard II-V-I jazz progression.<ref>Levine (1989: 127).</ref> This is a very common progression, used in pieces such as Miles Davis' \"Tune Up.\" The following example shows the V pentatonic scale over a II-V-I progression.<ref>After Mark Levine (1989: 127). ''The Jazz Piano Book''.</ref>\n\n[[File:II V I.tiff|thumb|center|upright=2.05|V pentatonic scale over II-V-I chord progression.]]\n\nAccordingly, John Coltrane's \"[[Giant Steps]]\" (1960), with its 26 chords per 16 bars, can be played using only three pentatonic scales. Coltrane studied [[Nicolas Slonimsky]]'s ''Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns'', which contains material that is virtually identical to portions of \"Giant Steps\".<ref>Bair, Jeff (2003: 5). ''Cyclic Patterns in John Coltrane's Melodic Vocabulary as Influenced by Nicolas Slonimsky's Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns: An Analysis of Selected Improvisations''. PhD Thesis. University of North Texas. Web. https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc4348/m2/1/high_res_d/dissertation.pdf</ref> The harmonic complexity of \"Giant Steps\" is on the level of the most advanced 20th-century art music. Superimposing the pentatonic scale over \"Giant Steps\" is not merely a matter of harmonic simplification, but also a sort of \"Africanizing\" of the piece, which provides an alternate approach for soloing. Mark Levine observes that when mixed in with more conventional \"playing the changes\", pentatonic scales provide \"structure and a feeling of increased space.\"<ref>Levine, Mark (1995: 205).

Sher Music. {{ISBN|1-883217-04-0}}</ref>\n\n===Jazz fusion===\n{{Main|Jazz fusion}}\n[[File:Miles Davis 24.jpg|thumb|right|Fusion trumpeter [[Miles Davis]] in 1989]]\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the hybrid form of jazz-rock [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] was developed by combining jazz improvisation with rock rhythms, electric instruments and the highly amplified stage sound of rock musicians such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Frank Zappa]]. Jazz fusion often uses mixed meters, odd time signatures, syncopation, complex chords, and harmonies.\n\nAccording to [[AllMusic]]:\n<blockquote>...until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were nearly completely separate. [However, ...] as rock became more creative and its musicianship improved, and as some in the jazz world became bored with [[hard bop]] and did not want to play strictly [[free jazz|avant-garde music]], the two different idioms began to trade ideas and occasionally combine forces.\"<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d299|pure_url=yes}}|title=Explore: Fusion|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Miles Davis' new directions====\nIn 1969, Davis fully embraced the electric instrument approach to jazz with ''[[In a Silent Way]]'', which can be considered his first fusion album. Composed of two side-long suites edited heavily by producer [[Teo Macero]], this quiet, static album would be equally influential to the development of [[ambient music]].\n\nAs Davis recalls:\n<blockquote>The music I was really listening to in 1968 was [[James Brown]], the great guitar player [[Jimi Hendrix]], and a new group who had just come out with a hit record, \"[[Dance to the Music (Sly and the Family Stone album)|Dance to the Music]]\", [[Sly and the Family Stone]]... I wanted to make it more like rock. When we recorded ''In a Silent Way'' I just threw out all the chord sheets and told everyone to play off of that.\"<ref>Davis, Miles, with Quincy Troupe (1989: 298) ''The Autobiography''. New York: Simon and Schuster.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwo contributors to ''In a Silent Way'' also joined organist [[Larry Young (musician)|Larry Young]] to create one of the early acclaimed fusion albums: [[Emergency! (album)|''Emergency!'']] by [[The Tony Williams Lifetime]].\n\n====Psychedelic-jazz====\n\n=====''Bitches Brew''=====\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nDavis' ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1970) album was his most successful of this era. Although inspired by rock and funk, Davis' fusion creations were original and brought about a new type of avant-garde, electronic, psychedelic-jazz, as far from pop music as any other Davis work.\n\n=====Herbie Hancock=====\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nPianist Herbie Hancock (a Davis alumnus) released four albums in the short-lived (1970\u20131973) psychedelic-jazz subgenre: ''[[Mwandishi]]'' (1972), ''[[Crossings (Herbie Hancock album)|Crossings]]'' (1973), and ''[[Sextant (album)|Sextant]]'' (1973). The rhythmic background was a mix of rock, funk, and African-type textures.\n\nMusicians who had previously worked with Davis formed the four most influential fusion groups: [[Weather Report]] and [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] emerged in 1971 and were soon followed by [[Return to Forever]] and [[The Headhunters]].\n\n=====Weather Report=====\n[[Weather Report]]'s self-titled electronic and psychedelic ''[[Weather Report (1971 album)|Weather Report]]'' debut album caused a sensation in the jazz world on its arrival in 1971, thanks to the pedigree of the group's members (including percussionist [[Airto Moreira]]), and their unorthodox approach to music. The album featured a softer sound than would be the case in later years (predominantly using acoustic bass with Shorter exclusively playing [[soprano saxophone]], and with no [[synthesizer]]s involved), but is still considered a classic of early fusion. It built on the avant-garde experiments which [[Joe Zawinul]] and Shorter had pioneered with Miles Davis on ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', including an avoidance of head-and-chorus composition in favour of continuous rhythm and movement \u2013 but took the music further. To emphasise the group's rejection of standard methodology, the album opened with the inscrutable avant-garde atmospheric piece \"Milky Way\", which featured by Shorter's extremely muted saxophone inducing vibrations in Zawinul's piano strings while the latter pedalled the instrument. ''[[Down Beat]]'' described the album as \"music beyond category\", and awarded it Album of the Year in the magazine's polls that year.\n\n[[Weather Report]]'s subsequent releases were creative funk-jazz works.<ref>Dan, Morgenstern (1971). ''Down Beat'' May 13.</ref>\n\n====Jazz-rock====\nAlthough some jazz purists protested against the blend of jazz and rock, many jazz innovators crossed over from the contemporary hard bop scene into fusion. As well as the electric instruments of rock (such as electric guitar, electric bass, electric piano and synthesizer keyboards), fusion also used the powerful amplification, [[Distortion (music)|\"fuzz\" pedals]], [[wah-wah pedal]]s and other effects that were used by 1970s-era rock bands. Notable performers of jazz fusion included Miles Davis, [[Eddie Harris]], keyboardists [[Joe Zawinul]], [[Chick Corea]], and Herbie Hancock, vibraphonist [[Gary Burton]], drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)]], violinist [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], guitarists [[Larry Coryell]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], and [[Frank Zappa]], saxophonist Wayne Shorter and bassists [[Jaco Pastorius]] and [[Stanley Clarke]]. Jazz fusion was also popular in Japan, where the band [[Casiopea]] released over thirty fusion albums.\n\nAccording to jazz writer Stuart Nicholson, \"just as free jazz appeared on the verge of creating a whole new musical language in the 1960s ... jazz-rock briefly suggested the promise of doing the same\" with albums such as Williams' ''[[Emergency! (album)|Emergency!]]'' (1970) and Davis' ''[[Agharta (album)|Agharta]]'' (1975), which Nicholson said \"suggested the potential of evolving into something that might eventually define itself as a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before.\" This development was stifled by commercialism, Nicholson said, as the genre \"mutated into a peculiar species of jazz-inflected pop music that eventually took up residence on FM radio\" at the end of the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|page=614|last1=Harrison|first1=Max|last2=Thacker|first2=Eric|last3=Nicholson|first3=Stuart|title=The Essential Jazz Records: Modernism to Postmodernism|year=2000|publisher=[[A&C Black]]|isbn=978-0720118223}}</ref>\n\n===Jazz-funk===\n{{Main|Jazz-funk}}\nBy the mid-1970s, the sound known as jazz-funk had developed, characterized by a strong [[beat (music)|back beat]] ([[Groove (music)|groove]]), electrified sounds<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/jazz/jazzfunk/more.html |title=Free Jazz-Funk Music: Album, Track and Artist Charts |accessdate=2010-11-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920131709/http://www.rhapsody.com/jazz/jazzfunk/more.html |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}, ''Rhapsody Online&nbsp;\u2014 Rhapsody.com'' (October 20, 2010).</ref> and, often, the presence of electronic [[analog synthesizers]]. Jazz-funk also draws influences from traditional African music, Afro-Cuban rhythms and Jamaican [[reggae]], notably Kingston bandleader [[Sonny Bradshaw]]. Another feature is the shift of emphasis from improvisation to composition: arrangements, melody and overall writing became important. The integration of [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] music into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is wide and ranges from strong [[Musical improvisation#Jazz improvisation|jazz improvisation]] to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz [[riff]]s and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/explore/style/d202 |title=Explore: Jazz-Funk |accessdate=2010-10-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019041451/http://allmusic.com/explore/style/d202 |archivedate=2010-10-19 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEarly examples are Herbie Hancock's [[The Headhunters|Headhunters]] band and Miles Davis' ''[[On the Corner]]'' album, which, in 1972, began Davis' foray into jazz-funk and was, he claimed, an attempt at reconnecting with the young black audience which had largely forsaken jazz for [[rock and roll|rock]] and funk. While there is a discernible rock and funk influence in the [[timbre]]s of the instruments employed, other tonal and rhythmic textures, such as the Indian tambora and tablas and Cuban congas and bongos, create a multi-layered soundscape. The album was a culmination of sorts of the ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'' approach that Davis and producer [[Teo Macero]] had begun to explore in the late 1960s.\n\n===Other trends===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nJazz continued to expand and change, influenced by other types of music such as [[world music]], [[experimental music|avant garde classical music]] and rock and pop. Jazz musicians began to improvise on unusual instruments, such as the jazz [[harp]] ([[Alice Coltrane]]), the electrically amplified and wah-wah pedaled jazz violin ([[Jean-Luc Ponty]]) and the bagpipes ([[Rufus Harley]]).  In 1966 jazz trumpeter [[Don Ellis]] and Indian sitar player [[Harihar Rao]] founded the Hindustani Jazz Sextet.  In 1971, guitarist [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]'s [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] began playing a mix of rock and jazz infused with [[Music of India|East Indian]] influences.  In the 1970s the [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] record label began in Germany with artists including [[Keith Jarrett]], [[Paul Bley]], the [[Pat Metheny Group]], [[Jan Garbarek]], [[Ralph Towner]], [[Kenny Wheeler]], [[John Taylor (jazz)|John Taylor]], [[John Surman]], and [[Eberhard Weber]], establishing a new [[chamber music]] aesthetic which featured mainly acoustic instruments, occasionally incorporating elements of world music and folk.\n\n===Traditionalism in the 1980s===\n{{main|1980s in jazz}}\n[[File:Wynton Marsalis 2009 09 13.jpg|thumb|right|Wynton Marsalis]]\n\nThe 1980s saw something of a reaction against the fusion and free jazz that had dominated the 1970s. Trumpeter [[Wynton Marsalis]] emerged early in the decade, and strove to create music within what he believed was the tradition, rejecting both fusion and free jazz and creating extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by artists such as [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Duke Ellington]], as well as the hard bop of the 1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis' critical and commercial success was a cause or a symptom of the reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz and the resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz pioneered in the 1960s (particularly [[modal jazz]] and [[post-bop]]); nonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism, even if fusion and free jazz were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and evolve.\n\nFor example, several musicians who had been prominent in the [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] genre during the 1970s began to record acoustic jazz once more, including [[Chick Corea]] and [[Herbie Hancock]]. Other musicians who had experimented with electronic instruments in the previous decade had abandoned them by the 1980s; for example, [[Bill Evans]], [[Joe Henderson]], and [[Stan Getz]]. Even the 1980s music of [[Miles Davis]], although certainly still fusion, adopted a far more accessible and recognisably jazz-oriented approach than his abstract work of the mid-1970s, such as a return to a theme-and-solos approach.\n\nThe emergence of young jazz talent beginning to perform in older, established musicians' groups further impacted the resurgence of traditionalism in the jazz community. In the 1970s, the groups of [[Betty Carter]] and [[The Jazz Messengers|Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers]] retained their conservative jazz approaches in the midst of fusion and jazz-rock, and in addition to difficulty booking their acts, struggled to find younger generations of personnel to authentically play traditional styles such as [[hard bop]] and [[bebop]]. In the late 1970s, however, a resurgence of younger jazz players in Blakey's band began to occur. This movement included musicians such as [[Valery Ponomarev]] and [[Bobby Watson]], [[Dennis Irwin]] and [[James Williams (musician)|James Williams]].\nIn the 1980s, in addition to [[Wynton Marsalis|Wynton]] and [[Branford Marsalis]], the emergence of pianists in the Jazz Messengers such as [[Donald Brown (musician)|Donald Brown]], [[Mulgrew Miller]], and later, [[Bennie Green|Benny Green]], bassists such as [[Charles Fambrough]], [[Lonnie Plaxico]] (and later, [[Peter Washington]] and Essiet Essiet) horn players such as [[Bill Pierce (saxophonist)|Bill Pierce]], [[Donald Harrison]] and later [[Javon Jackson]] and [[Terence Blanchard]] emerged as talented jazz musicians, all of whom made significant contributions in later 1990s and 2000s jazz music.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe young Jazz Messengers' contemporaries, including [[Roy Hargrove]], [[Marcus Roberts]], [[Wallace Roney]] and [[Mark Whitfield]] were also influenced by [[Wynton Marsalis]]'s emphasis toward jazz tradition. These younger rising stars rejected avant-garde approaches and instead championed the acoustic jazz sound of [[Charlie Parker]], [[Thelonious Monk]] and early recordings of the first [[Miles Davis]] quintet. This group of \"Young Lions\" sought to reaffirm jazz as a high art tradition comparable to the discipline of classical music.<ref name=\"Guilliatt, Richard\">{{cite web|last1=Guilliatt|first1=Richard|title=Jazz: The Young Lions' Roar|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-13/entertainment/ca-1495_1_lincoln-center-jazz-orchestra|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=13 September 1992}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[Betty Carter]]'s rotation of young musicians in her group foreshadowed many of New York's preeminent traditional jazz players later in their careers.

[[Anthony Braxton]] began recording standards over familiar chord changes. [[Cecil Taylor]] played duets in concert with [[Mary Lou Williams]], and let her set out structured harmonies and familiar jazz vocabulary under his blistering keyboard attack. And the next generation of progressive players would be even more accommodating, moving inside and outside the changes without thinking twice. Musicians such as [[David Murray (saxophonist)|David Murray]] or [[Don Pullen]] may have felt the call of free-form jazz, but they never forgot all the other ways one could play African-American music for fun and profit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazz.com/jazz-blog/2008/2/27/where-did-our-revolution-go-part-three |title=Where Did Our Revolution Go?

Chick Corea similarly began exploring jazz standards in the 1980s, having neglected them for the 1970s.\n\nIn 1987, the [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] passed a bill proposed by Democratic Representative [[John Conyers Jr.]] to define jazz as a unique form of American music, stating:\n\n<blockquote>... that jazz is hereby designated as a rare and valuable national American treasure to which we should devote our attention, support and resources to make certain it is preserved, understood and promulgated.</blockquote>\n\nIt passed in the House of Representatives on September 23, 1987, and in the Senate on November 4, 1987.<ref name=HR57>HR-57 Center [http://www.hr57.org/hconres57.html HR-57 Center for the Preservation of Jazz and Blues, with the six-point mandate.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918100538/http://www.hr57.org/hconres57.html |date=2008-09-18 }}</ref>\n\n===Smooth jazz===\n{{Main|Smooth jazz}}\n[[File:David Sanborn 2008 2.jpg|thumb|upright|David Sanborn, 2008]]\nIn the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called \"pop fusion\" or \"smooth jazz\" became successful, garnering significant radio airplay in \"[[quiet storm]]\" time slots at radio stations in urban markets across the U.S. This helped to establish or bolster the careers of vocalists including [[Al Jarreau]], [[Anita Baker]], [[Chaka Khan]], and [[Sade Adu|Sade]], as well as saxophonists including [[Grover Washington Jr.]], [[Kenny G]], [[Kirk Whalum]], [[Boney James]], and [[David Sanborn]]. In general, smooth jazz is downtempo (the most widely played tracks are of 90\u2013105 [[beats per minute]]), and has a lead melody-playing instrument (saxophone, especially soprano and tenor, and [[legato]] electric guitar are popular).\n\nIn his ''[[Newsweek]]'' article \"The Problem With Jazz Criticism\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Opinion: The Problem With Jazz Criticism|author=Stanley Crouch|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/58477|website=Newsweek|date=June 5, 2003|accessdate=April 9, 2010}}</ref> [[Stanley Crouch]] considers Miles Davis' playing of fusion to be a turning point that led to smooth jazz. Critic Aaron J. West has countered the often negative perceptions of smooth jazz, stating:\n<blockquote>I challenge the prevalent marginalization and malignment of smooth jazz in the standard jazz narrative. Furthermore, I question the assumption that smooth jazz is an unfortunate and unwelcomed evolutionary outcome of the jazz-fusion era. Instead, I argue that smooth jazz is a long-lived musical style that merits multi-disciplinary analyses of its origins, critical dialogues, performance practice, and reception.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc9722/|title=Caught Between Jazz and Pop: The Contested Origins, Criticism, Performance Practice, and Reception of Smooth Jazz|website=Digital.library.unt.edu|date=October 23, 2010|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Acid jazz, nu jazz and jazz rap===\n\n[[Acid jazz]] developed in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s, influenced by [[jazz-funk]] and [[electronic music|electronic dance music]]. Acid jazz often contains various types of electronic composition (sometimes including [[Sampling (music)]] or a live DJ cutting and [[scratching]]), but it is just as likely to be played live by musicians, who often showcase jazz interpretation as part of their performance. Richard S. Ginell of AllMusic considers [[Roy Ayers]] \"one of the prophets of acid jazz.\"<ref name=\"Ginell\">{{cite web |last1=Ginell |first1=Richard S. |title=Roy Ayers |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/roy-ayers-mn0000345168/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=21 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Nu jazz]] is influenced by jazz harmony and melodies, and there are usually no improvisational aspects. It can be very experimental in nature and can vary widely in sound and concept. It ranges from the combination of live instrumentation with the beats of jazz [[house music|house]] (as exemplified by [[Saint Germain (musician)|St Germain]], [[Jazzanova]], and [[Fila Brazillia]]) to more band-based improvised jazz with electronic elements (for example, [[The Cinematic Orchestra]], [[Kobol (band)|Kobol]] and the Norwegian \"future jazz\" style pioneered by [[Bugge Wesseltoft]], [[Jaga Jazzist]], and [[Nils Petter Molv\u00e6r]]).\n\n[[Jazz rap]] developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and incorporates jazz influences into [[hip hop]]. In 1988, [[Gang Starr]] released the debut single \"Words I Manifest\", which sampled [[Dizzy Gillespie]]'s 1962 \"Night in Tunisia\", and [[Stetsasonic]] released \"Talkin' All That Jazz\", which sampled [[Lonnie Liston Smith]]. Gang Starr's debut LP ''[[No More Mr. Nice Guy (Gang Starr album)|No More Mr. Nice Guy]]'' (1989) and their 1990 track \"Jazz Thing\" sampled [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Ramsey Lewis]]. The groups which made up the [[Native Tongues Posse]] tended toward jazzy releases: these include the [[Jungle Brothers]]' debut ''[[Straight Out the Jungle]]'' (1988), and [[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s ''[[People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm]]'' (1990) and ''[[The Low End Theory]]'' (1991). Rap duo [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]] incorporated jazz influences on their 1992 debut ''[[Mecca and the Soul Brother]]''. Rapper [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]]'s [[Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1|Jazzmatazz]] series began in 1993 using jazz musicians during the studio recordings.\n\nAlhough jazz rap had achieved little mainstream success, Miles Davis' final album ''[[Doo-Bop]]'' (released posthumously in 1992) was based on hip hop beats and collaborations with producer [[Easy Mo Bee]]. Davis' ex-bandmate [[Herbie Hancock]] also absorbed hip-hop influences in the mid-1990s, releasing the album ''[[Dis Is Da Drum]]'' in 1994.\n\n===Punk jazz and jazzcore===\n[[File:John Zorn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Zorn]] performing in 2006]]\nThe relaxation of orthodoxy which was concurrent with [[post-punk]] in London and New York City led to a new appreciation of jazz.

Individual performers often play in a variety of styles, sometimes in the same performance. Pianist [[Brad Mehldau]] and [[The Bad Plus]] have explored contemporary rock music within the context of the traditional jazz acoustic piano trio, recording instrumental jazz versions of songs by rock musicians. The Bad Plus have also incorporated elements of free jazz into their music. A firm avant-garde or free jazz stance has been maintained by some players, such as saxophonists [[Greg Osby]] and [[Charles Gayle]], while others, such as [[James Carter (musician)|James Carter]], have incorporated free jazz elements into a more traditional framework.\n\n[[Harry Connick Jr.]] began his career playing stride piano and the dixieland jazz of his home, New Orleans, beginning with his first recording when he was ten years old.<ref name=\"Bush\">{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=John|title=Harry Connick, Jr|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/harry-connick-jr-mn0000949259/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=14 January 2018}}</ref> Some of his earliest lessons were at the home of pianist [[Ellis Marsalis Jr.|Ellis Marsalis]].<ref name=\"home\">{{Cite episode| title =Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick Jr.| series =Finding Your Roots| first =Henry| last =Louis Gates Jr. (host)| network =PBS| date =July 17, 2010| season =1| number =1|type=DVD}}</ref> Connick had success on the pop charts after recording the soundtrack to the movie ''[[When Harry Met Sally]]'', which sold over two million copies.<ref name=\"Bush\" /> Crossover success has also been achieved by [[Diana Krall]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Cassandra Wilson]], [[Kurt Elling]], and [[Jamie Cullum]].\n\nA number of players who usually perform in largely [[straight-ahead jazz|straight-ahead]] settings have emerged since the 1990s, including pianists [[Jason Moran (musician)|Jason Moran]] and [[Vijay Iyer]], guitarist [[Kurt Rosenwinkel]], vibraphonist [[Stefon Harris]], trumpeters [[Roy Hargrove]] and [[Terence Blanchard]], saxophonists [[Chris Potter (jazz saxophonist)|Chris Potter]] and [[Joshua Redman]], clarinetist [[Ken Peplowski]] and bassist [[Christian McBride]].\n\nAlthough [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]] reached the height of its popularity in the 1970s, the use of electronic instruments and rock-derived musical elements in jazz continued in the 1990s and 2000s. Musicians using this approach include [[Pat Metheny]], [[John Abercrombie (guitarist)|John Abercrombie]], [[John Scofield]] and the Swedish group [[Esbj\u00f6rn Svensson Trio|e.s.t.]]\n\nIn 2001, [[Ken Burns]]'s documentary ''[[Jazz (TV series)|Jazz]]'' was premiered on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], featuring [[Wynton Marsalis]] and other experts reviewing the entire history of American jazz to that time. It received some criticism, however, for its failure to reflect the many distinctive non-American traditions and styles in jazz that had developed, and its limited representation of US developments in the last quarter of the 20th century.\n\nThe mid-2010s have seen an increasing influence of R&B, hip-hop, and pop music on jazz. In 2015, [[Kendrick Lamar]] released his third studio album, ''[[To Pimp a Butterfly]]''. The album heavily featured prominent contemporary jazz artists such as [[Thundercat (musician)|Thundercat]]<ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite AV media notes |title=To Pimp a Butterfly |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/to-pimp-a-butterfly-mw0002835159/credits |publisher=[[Interscope Records]]}}</ref> and redefined jazz rap with a larger focus on improvisation and live soloing rather than simply sampling. In that same year, saxophonist [[Kamasi Washington]] released his nearly three-hour long debut, ''[[The Epic (album)|The Epic]]''. Its hip-hop inspired beats and R&B vocal interludes was not only acclaimed by critics for being innovative in keeping jazz relevant,<ref>{{cite web|author=Russell Warfield|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/18781/reviews/4148955|title=The Epic|website=drownedinsound.com|date=May 5, 2015|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref> but also sparked a small resurgence in jazz on the internet.\n\nAnother internet-aided trend of 2010's jazz is that of extreme [[reharmonization]], inspired by both virtuosic players known for their speed and rhythm such as [[Art Tatum]], as well as players known for their ambitious voicings and chords such as Bill Evans.

He is regarded by the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' as the foremost prose satirist in the English language,<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> and is less well known for his poetry. He originally published all of his works under pseudonyms \u2013 such as [[Lemuel Gulliver]], [[Isaac Bickerstaff]], [[M. B. Drapier]] \u2013 or anonymously. He was a master of two styles of satire, the [[Satire#Classifications|Horatian and Juvenalian]] styles.\n\nHis [[deadpan]], [[ironic]] writing style, particularly in ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', has led to such [[satire]] being subsequently termed \"Swiftian\".<ref>\"What higher accolade can a reviewer pay to a contemporary satirist than to call his or her work ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Swiftian Swiftian]''?\" Frank Boyle, \"Johnathan Swift\", Ch 11 in ''A Companion to Satire: Ancient and Modern'' (2008), edited by Ruben Quintero, John Wiley & Sons {{ISBN|0470657952}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Youth===\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2017}}<!--three paragraphs without citations-->\nJonathan Swift was born on 30 November 1667 in [[Dublin]], Ireland.

His maternal grandfather, James Ericke, was the vicar of Thornton, England. In 1634 the vicar was convicted of Puritan practices. Some time thereafter, Ericke and his family, including his young daughter Abilgail, fled to Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stubbs |first=John |title=Jonathan Swift: The Reluctant Rebel |pages=25-26 |publisher=WW Norton & Co |location= New York |date= 2016}}</ref>\n\nSwift's father joined his older brother, Godwin, in the practice of law in Ireland.<ref>Stubbs (2016), p. 43.</ref> He died in Dublin about seven months before his namesake was born.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=so6ZNdlRfLIC&pg=PA412&lpg=PA412&dq=jonathan+swift%27s+father+died&source=bl&ots=Hztn3EynKz&sig=VIVr25fNypujgBU7xXhD8W1rIKM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hh8mU6bbL8ePkAWs-oCwDw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=jonathan%20swift's%20father%20died&f=false|title=Jonathan Swift|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/A-Reading-Life/Jonathan-Swift-His-Life-and-His-World/ba-p/11769|title=Jonathan Swift: His Life and His World|work=The Barnes & Noble Review}}</ref> He died of syphilis, which he said he got from dirty sheets when out of town.<ref>Stubbs (2016), p. 54.</ref> \n\nAt the age of one, child Jonathan was taken by his wet nurse to her hometown of [[Whitehaven]], Cumberland, England. He said that there he learned to read the Bible. His nurse returned him to his mother, still in Ireland, when he was three.<ref>Stubbs (2016), pp. 58\u201363.</ref>\n\nHis mother returned to England after his birth, leaving him in the care of his Uncle Godwin, a close friend and confidant of [[John Temple (judge)|Sir John Temple]] whose son later employed Swift as his secretary.<ref name=LS205>Stephen ''DNB'', p. 205</ref>\n\n[[File:Houghton Lowell 1816.7.3 - Life of Jonathan Swift, p 8.jpg|thumb|left|The house in which Swift was born; 1865 illustration]]\nSwift's family had several interesting literary connections. His grandmother Elizabeth (Dryden) Swift was the niece of [[Sir Erasmus Dryden, 1st Baronet|Sir Erasmus Dryden]], grandfather of poet [[John Dryden]]. The same grandmother's aunt Katherine (Throckmorton) Dryden was a first cousin of [[Elizabeth Raleigh|Elizabeth]], wife of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]. His great-great grandmother Margaret (Godwin) Swift was the sister of [[Francis Godwin]], author of ''[[The Man in the Moone]]'' which influenced parts of Swift's ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''. His uncle Thomas Swift married a daughter of poet and playwright Sir [[William Davenant]], a godson of [[William Shakespeare]].\n\nSwift's benefactor and uncle Godwin Swift (1628\u20131695) took primary responsibility for the young man, sending him with one of his cousins to [[Kilkenny College]] (also attended by philosopher [[George Berkeley]]).<ref name=LS205 /> He arrived there at the age of six, where he was expected to have already learned the basic declensions in Latin. He hadn't and so started at a lower form. Swift graduated in 1682, when he was 15.<ref>Stubbs (2016), pp. 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nHe attended Dublin University ([[Trinity College, Dublin]]) in 1682, financed by Godwin's son Willoughby. The four-year course followed a curriculum largely set in the Middle Ages for the priesthood. The lectures were dominated by Aristotelian logic and philosophy. The basic skill taught the students was debate and they were expected to be able to argue both sides of any argument or topic. Swift was an above-average student but not exceptional, and received his B.A. in 1686 \"by special grace.\"<ref>Stubbs (2016), pp. 86\u201390</ref>\n\nSwift was studying for his master's degree when political troubles in Ireland surrounding the [[Glorious Revolution]] forced him to leave for England in 1688, where his mother helped him get a position as secretary and personal assistant of [[William Temple (British politician)|Sir William Temple]] at [[Moor Park, Farnham]].<ref>Stephen ''DNB'', p. 206</ref> Temple was an English diplomat who arranged the [[Triple Alliance of 1668]]. He had retired from public service to his country estate to tend his gardens and write his memoirs. Gaining his employer's confidence, Swift \"was often trusted with matters of great importance\".<ref name=LS207>Stephen ''DNB'', p. 207</ref> Within three years of their acquaintance, Temple had introduced his secretary to [[William III of England|William&nbsp;III]] and sent him to London to urge the King to consent to a bill for triennial Parliaments.\n\nSwift took up his residence at Moor Park where he met [[Esther Johnson]], then eight years old, the daughter of an impoverished widow who acted as companion to Temple's sister Lady Giffard. Swift was her tutor and mentor, giving her the nickname \"Stella\", and the two maintained a close but ambiguous relationship for the rest of Esther's life.<ref name=LS208>Stephen ''DNB'', p. 208</ref>\n\nIn 1690, Swift left Temple for Ireland because of his health but returned to Moor Park the following year. The illness consisted of fits of vertigo or giddiness, now known to be [[M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease]], and it continued to plague him throughout his life.<ref>Bewley, Thomas H., \"The health of Jonathan Swift\", ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'' 1998;91:602\u2013605</ref> During this second stay with Temple, Swift received his M.A. from [[Hertford College, Oxford|Hart Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], in 1692. Then he left Moor Park, apparently despairing of gaining a better position through Temple's patronage, to become an ordained priest in the Established [[Church of Ireland]]. He was appointed to the [[prebendary|prebend]] of Kilroot in the [[Diocese of Connor (Church of Ireland)|Diocese of Connor]] in 1694, with his parish located at [[Kilroot]], near [[Carrickfergus]] in [[County Antrim]].\n\nSwift appears to have been miserable in his new position, being isolated in a small, remote community far from the centres of power and influence. While at Kilroot, however, he may well have become romantically involved with Jane Waring, whom he called \"Varina\", the sister of an old college friend.<ref name=LS207 /> A letter from him survives, offering to remain if she would marry him and promising to leave and never return to Ireland if she refused. She presumably refused, because Swift left his post and returned to England and Temple's service at Moor Park in 1696, and he remained there until Temple's death. There he was employed in helping to prepare Temple's memoirs and correspondence for publication. During this time, Swift wrote ''[[The Battle of the Books]]'', a satire responding to critics of Temple's ''Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning'' (1690), though ''Battle'' was not published until 1704.\n\nTemple died on 27 January 1699.<ref name=LS207 /> Swift, normally a harsh judge of human nature, said that all that was good and amiable in mankind had died with Temple.<ref name=LS207 /> He stayed on briefly in England to complete editing Temple's memoirs, and perhaps in the hope that recognition of his work might earn him a suitable position in England. Unfortunately, his work made enemies among some of Temple's family and friends, in particular Temple's formidable sister Lady Giffard, who objected to indiscretions included in the memoirs.<ref name=LS208 /> Swift's next move was to approach King William directly, based on his imagined connection through Temple and a belief that he had been promised a position. This failed so miserably that he accepted the lesser post of secretary and chaplain to the [[Baron Berkeley|Earl of Berkeley]], one of the Lords Justice of Ireland. However, when he reached Ireland, he found that the secretaryship had already been given to another. He soon obtained the living of Laracor, [[Agher]], and Rathbeggan, and the prebend of Dunlavin in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.<ref>Stephen ''DNB'', p. 209</ref>\n\nSwift ministered to a congregation of about 15 at Laracor, which was just over four and half miles (7.5&nbsp;km) from [[Summerhill, County Meath]], and {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} from Dublin. He had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden, making a canal after the Dutch fashion of Moor Park, planting willows, and rebuilding the vicarage. As chaplain to Lord Berkeley, he spent much of his time in Dublin and travelled to London frequently over the next ten years. In 1701, he anonymously published the political pamphlet ''A Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome''.\n\n===Writer===\nSwift had residence in [[Trim, County Meath]], after 1700. He wrote many of his works during this time period. In February 1702, Swift received his [[Doctor of Divinity]] degree from [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. That spring he travelled to England and then returned to Ireland in October, accompanied by Esther Johnson\u2014now 20\u2014and his friend Rebecca Dingley, another member of William Temple's household. There is a great mystery and controversy over Swift's relationship with Esther Johnson, nicknamed \"Stella\". Many, notably his close friend [[Thomas Sheridan (divine)|Thomas Sheridan]], believed that they were secretly married in 1716; others, like Swift's housekeeper Mrs Brent and Rebecca Dingley (who lived with Stella all through her years in Ireland) dismissed the story as absurd.<ref>Stephen ''DNB'', pp. 215\u2013217</ref> Swift certainly did not wish her to marry anyone else: in 1704, when their mutual friend [[William Tisdall (cleric)|William Tisdall]]  informed Swift that he intended to propose to Stella, Swift wrote to him to dissuade him from the idea. Although the tone of the letter was courteous, Swift privately expressed his disgust for Tisdall as an \"interloper\", and they were estranged for many years.\n\nDuring his visits to England in these years, Swift published ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'' and ''[[The Battle of the Books]]'' (1704) and began to gain a reputation as a writer. This led to close, lifelong friendships with [[Alexander Pope]], [[John Gay]], and [[John Arbuthnot]], forming the core of the Martinus [[Scriblerus Club]] (founded in 1713).\n\nSwift became increasingly active politically in these years.<ref>Stephen ''DNB'', p. 212.</ref> Swift supported the [[Glorious Revolution]] and early in his life belonged to the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]].<ref name=\"Fox\">{{cite book |last1=Fox |first1=Christopher |title=The Cambridge Companion to Jonathan Swift |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=36-39}}</ref><ref name=\"Cody\">{{cite web |last1=Cody |first1=David |title=Jonathan Swift's Political Beliefs |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/swift/politics1.html |website=Victorian Web}}</ref> As a member of the Anglican Church, he feared a return of the Catholic monarchy and \"Papist\" absolutism.<ref name=\"Cody\" /> From 1707 to 1709 and again in 1710, Swift was in London unsuccessfully urging upon the Whig administration of [[Lord Godolphin]] the claims of the Irish clergy to the [[Queen Anne's Bounty|First-Fruits and Twentieths]] (\"Queen Anne's Bounty\"), which brought in about \u00a32,500 a year, already granted to their brethren in England. He found the opposition [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] leadership more sympathetic to his cause, and, when they came to power in 1710, he was recruited to support their cause as editor of ''[[The Examiner (1710\u20131714)|The Examiner]]''. In 1711, Swift published the political pamphlet ''[[The Conduct of the Allies]]'', attacking the Whig government for its inability to end the prolonged war with France. The incoming Tory government conducted secret (and illegal) negotiations with France, resulting in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713) ending the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].\n\nSwift was part of the inner circle of the Tory government,<ref>Stephen ''DNB'', pp. 212\u2013215</ref> and often acted as mediator between [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Henry St John]] (Viscount Bolingbroke), the secretary of state for foreign affairs (1710\u201315), and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]] (Earl of Oxford), lord treasurer and prime minister (1711\u20131714). Swift recorded his experiences and thoughts during this difficult time in a long series of letters to Esther Johnson, collected and published after his death as ''[[A Journal to Stella]]''. The animosity between the two Tory leaders eventually led to the dismissal of Harley in 1714. With the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] that year, the Whigs returned to power, and the Tory leaders were tried for treason for conducting secret negotiations with France.\n\nSwift has been described by scholars as \"a Whig in politics and Tory in religion\" and Swift related his own views in similar terms, stating that as \"a lover of liberty, I found myself to be what they called a Whig in politics...But, as to religion, I confessed myself to be an High-Churchman.\"<ref name=\"Fox\" /> In his \"Thoughts on Religion\", fearing the intense partisan strife waged over religious belief in the seventeenth century England, Swift wrote that \"Every man, as a member of the commonwealth, ought to be content with the possession of his own opinion in private.\"<ref name=\"Fox\" /> However, it should be borne in mind that, during Swift's time period, terms like \"Whig\" and \"Tory\" both encompassed a wide array of opinions and factions and neither term aligns with a modern political party or modern political alignments.<ref name=\"Fox\" />\n\nAlso during these years in London, Swift became acquainted with the Vanhomrigh family (Dutch merchants who had settled in Ireland, then moved to London) and became involved with one of the daughters, [[Esther Vanhomrigh|Esther]]. Swift furnished Esther with the nickname \"[[Vanessa (name)|Vanessa]]\" (derived by adding \"Essa\", a pet form of Esther, to the \"Van\" of her surname, Vanhomrigh), and she features as one of the main characters in his poem ''[[Cadenus and Vanessa]]''. The poem and their correspondence suggest that Esther was infatuated with Swift, and that he may have reciprocated her affections, only to regret this and then try to break off the relationship.<ref>Stephen ''DNB'', pp. 215\u2013216</ref> Esther followed Swift to Ireland in 1714, and settled at her old family home, [[Celbridge Abbey]]. Their uneasy relationship continued for some years; then there appears to have been a confrontation, possibly involving Esther Johnson. Esther Vanhomrigh died in 1723 at the age of 35, having destroyed the will she had made in Swift's favour.<ref>Stephen ''DNB'', p. 216</ref> Another lady with whom he had a close but less intense relationship was [[Anne Long]], a toast of the [[Kit-Cat Club]].\n\n===Maturity===\n[[File:Jonathan Swift by Rupert Barber, 1745, National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|upright|Jonathan Swift (shown without wig) by Rupert Barber, 1745, National Portrait Gallery, London]]\nBefore the fall of the Tory government, Swift hoped that his services would be rewarded with a church appointment in England. However, Queen Anne appeared to have taken a dislike to Swift and thwarted these efforts. Her dislike has been attributed to ''A Tale of a Tub'', which she thought blasphemous, compounded by ''The Windsor Prophecy'', where Swift, with a surprising lack of tact, advised the Queen on which of her bedchamber ladies she should and should not trust.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gregg |first=Edward |title=Queen Anne |publisher= Yale University Press |date=1980 |pages= 352\u2013353}}</ref> The best position his friends could secure for him was the [[Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|Deanery of St Patrick's]]; this was not in the Queen's gift and Anne, who could be a bitter enemy, made it clear that Swift would not have received the preferment if she could have prevented it.<ref>Gregg (1980), p. 353</ref> With the return of the Whigs, Swift's best move was to leave England and he returned to Ireland in disappointment, a virtual exile, to live \"like a rat in a hole\".<ref>Stephen ''DNB'' p. 215</ref>\n\nOnce in Ireland, however, Swift began to turn his pamphleteering skills in support of Irish causes, producing some of his most memorable works: ''Proposal for Universal Use of Irish Manufacture'' (1720), ''Drapier's Letters'' (1724), and ''A Modest Proposal'' (1729), earning him the status of an Irish patriot.<ref>Stephen ''DNB'' pp. 217\u2013218</ref> This new role was unwelcome to the Government, which made clumsy attempts to silence him. His printer, Edward Waters, was convicted of [[seditious libel]] in 1720, but four years later a [[grand jury]] refused to find that the ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'' (which, though written under a pseudonym, were universally known to be Swift's work) were seditious.<ref>Sir [[Walter Scott]]. ''Life of Jonathan Swift'', vol. 1, Edinburgh 1814, pp. 281\u2013282</ref> Swift responded with an attack on the Irish judiciary almost unparalleled in its ferocity, his principal target being the \"vile and profligate villain\" [[William Whitshed]], [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington. ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'', London John Murray 1926, vol. 2 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nAlso during these years, he began writing his masterpiece, ''Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World, in Four Parts, by Lemuel Gulliver, first a surgeon, and then a captain of several ships'', better known as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''. Much of the material reflects his political experiences of the preceding decade. For instance, the episode in which the giant Gulliver puts out the Lilliputian palace fire by urinating on it can be seen as a metaphor for the Tories' illegal peace treaty; having done a good thing in an unfortunate manner. In 1726 he paid a long-deferred visit to London,<ref name=LS219>Stephen ''DNB'', p. 219</ref> taking with him the manuscript of ''Gulliver's Travels''. During his visit he stayed with his old friends [[Alexander Pope]], [[John Arbuthnot]] and [[John Gay]], who helped him arrange for the anonymous publication of his book. First published in November 1726, it was an immediate hit, with a total of three printings that year and another in early 1727. French, German, and Dutch translations appeared in 1727, and pirated copies were printed in Ireland.\n\nSwift returned to England one more time in 1727 and stayed with Alexander Pope once again. The visit was cut short when Swift received word that Esther Johnson was dying, and rushed back home to be with her.<ref name=LS219 /> On 28 January 1728, Esther Johnson died; Swift had prayed at her bedside, even composing prayers for her comfort. Swift could not bear to be present at the end, but on the night of her death he began to write his ''The Death of Mrs Johnson''. He was too ill to attend the funeral at St Patrick's.<ref name=LS219 /> Many years later, a lock of hair, assumed to be Esther Johnson's, was found in his desk, wrapped in a paper bearing the words, \"Only a woman's hair\".\n\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral Swift bust.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] in [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]]]]\nDeath became a frequent feature of Swift's life from this point. In 1731 he wrote ''Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift'', his own obituary published in 1739. In 1732, his good friend and collaborator [[John Gay]] died. In 1735, John Arbuthnot, another friend from his days in London, died. In 1738 Swift began to show signs of illness, and in 1742 he may have suffered a stroke, losing the ability to speak and realising his worst fears of becoming mentally disabled. (\"I shall be like that tree,\" he once said, \"I shall die at the top.\")<ref>Stephen ''DNB'', p. 221</ref> He became increasingly quarrelsome, and long-standing friendships, like that with Thomas Sheridan, ended without sufficient cause. To protect him from unscrupulous hangers on, who had begun to prey on the great man, his closest companions had him declared of \"unsound mind and memory\". However, it was long believed by many that Swift was actually insane at this point. In his book ''[[Literature and Western Man]]'', author [[J. B. Priestley]] even cites the final chapters of ''Gulliver's Travels'' as proof of Swift's approaching \"insanity\". Bewley attributes his decline to 'terminal dementia'.<ref>Bewley, Thomas H., The health of Jonathan Swift, Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 1998;91:602-605</ref>\n\nIn part VIII of his series, ''[[The Story of Civilization]]'', [[Will Durant]] describes the final years of Swift's life as such:\n\n<blockquote>\"Definite symptoms of madness appeared in 1738. In 1741, guardians were appointed to take care of his affairs and watch lest in his outbursts of violence he should do himself harm. In 1742, he suffered great pain from the inflammation of his left eye, which swelled to the size of an egg; five attendants had to restrain him from tearing out his eye. He went a whole year without uttering a word.\"<ref>\"The Story of Civilization\", V.8., 362.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1744, Alexander Pope died. Then on 19 October 1745, Swift, at nearly 80, died.<ref name=LS222>Stephen ''DNB'', p. 222</ref> After being laid out in public view for the people of Dublin to pay their last respects, he was buried in his own cathedral by Esther Johnson's side, in accordance with his wishes. The bulk of his fortune (\u00a312,000) was left to found a hospital for the mentally ill, originally known as St Patrick\u2019s Hospital for Imbeciles, which opened in 1757, and which [[St. Patrick's Hospital|still exists]] as a psychiatric hospital.<ref name=LS222 />\n\n===Epitaph===\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral Swift epitaph.jpg|thumb|[[Epitaph]] in [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]] near his burial site.]]\n:''(Text extracted from the introduction to ''The Journal to Stella'' by George A.

Yeats]] poetically translated it from the Latin as:\n\n: Swift has sailed into his rest;\n: Savage indignation there\n: Cannot lacerate his breast.\n: Imitate him if you dare,\n: World-besotted traveller; he\n: Served human liberty.\n\n==Works==\n{{wikisource-author}}\nSwift was a prolific writer, notable for his satires. The most recent collection of his prose works (Herbert Davis, ed. Basil Blackwell, 1965\u2013) comprises fourteen volumes. A recent edition of his complete poetry (Pat Rodges, ed. Penguin, 1983) is 953 pages long. One edition of his correspondence (David Woolley, ed. P. Lang, 1999) fills three volumes.\n\n===Major prose works===\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2017}}<!--only one reference in section-->\n[[File:Jonathan Swift - Project Gutenberg eText 18250.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jonathan Swift at the [[Deanery]] of St Patrick's, illus. from 1905 Temple Scott edition of ''Works'']]\n\nSwift's first major prose work, ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'', demonstrates many of the themes and stylistic techniques he would employ in his later work. It is at once wildly playful and funny while being pointed and harshly critical of its targets. In its main thread, the ''Tale'' recounts the exploits of three sons, representing the main threads of Christianity, who receive a bequest from their father of a coat each, with the added instructions to make no alterations whatsoever. However, the sons soon find that their coats have fallen out of current fashion, and begin to look for loopholes in their father's will that will let them make the needed alterations. As each finds his own means of getting around their father's admonition, they struggle with each other for power and dominance. Inserted into this story, in alternating chapters, the narrator includes a series of whimsical \"digressions\" on various subjects.\n\nIn 1690, Sir [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]], Swift's patron, published ''An Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning'' a defence of classical writing (see [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]]), holding up the ''Epistles of Phalaris'' as an example. [[William Wotton]] responded to Temple with ''Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning'' (1694), showing that the ''Epistles'' were a later forgery. A response by the supporters of the Ancients was then made by [[Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery|Charles Boyle]] (later the 4th Earl of Orrery and father of Swift's first biographer). A further retort on the Modern side came from [[Richard Bentley]], one of the pre-eminent scholars of the day, in his essay ''Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris'' (1699). The final words on the topic belong to Swift in his ''[[Battle of the Books]]'' (1697, published 1704) in which he makes a humorous defence on behalf of Temple and the cause of the Ancients.\n\n[[File:Swift works.png|thumb|The title page to Swift's 1735 ''Works'', depicting the author in the Dean's chair, receiving the thanks of Ireland. The [[Horace|Horatian]] motto reads, {{Lang|la|Exegi Monumentum \u00c6re perennius}}, \"I have completed a monument more lasting than brass.\" The 'brass' is a pun, for Wood's [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpennies]] (alloyed with brass) lie scattered at his feet. [[Cherub]]im award Swift a poet's laurel.]]In 1708, a cobbler named [[John Partridge (astrologer)|John Partridge]] published a popular [[almanac]] of [[astrological]] predictions. Because Partridge falsely determined the deaths of several church officials, Swift attacked Partridge in ''Predictions for the Ensuing Year'' by [[Isaac Bickerstaff]], a parody predicting that Partridge would die on 29 March. Swift followed up with a pamphlet issued on 30 March claiming that Partridge had in fact died, which was widely believed despite Partridge's statements to the contrary. According to other sources,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Richard Steele uses the personae of Isaac Bickerstaff and was the one who wrote about the \"death\" of John Partridge and published it in ''The Spectator,'' not Jonathan Swift.\n\nThe ''Drapier's Letters'' (1724) was a series of pamphlets against the monopoly granted by the English government to [[William Wood (ironmaster)|William Wood]] to mint copper coinage for Ireland. It was widely believed that Wood would need to flood Ireland with debased coinage in order to make a profit. In these \"letters\" Swift posed as a shop-keeper\u2014a draper\u2014to criticise the plan. Swift's writing was so effective in undermining opinion in the project that a reward was offered by the government to anyone disclosing the true identity of the author. Though hardly a secret (on returning to Dublin after one of his trips to England, Swift was greeted with a banner, \"Welcome Home, Drapier\") no one turned Swift in, although there was an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the publisher Harding.<ref>Elrington Ball. ''The Judges in Ireland'', vol. 2 pp. 103\u2013105</ref> Thanks to the general outcry against the coinage, Wood's patent was recinded in September 1725 and the coins were kept out of circulation.<ref>{{cite book|first=Sabine |last=Baltes |year=2003 |title=The Pamphlet Controversy about Wood's Halfpence (1722-25) and the Tradition of Irish Constitutional Nationalism |publisher=Peter Lang GmbH |page=273}}</ref> In \"Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift\" (1739) Swift recalled this as one of his best achievements.\n\n''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', a large portion of which Swift wrote at Woodbrook House in County Laois, was published in 1726. It is regarded as his masterpiece. As with his other writings, the ''Travels'' was published under a pseudonym, the fictional Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon and later a sea captain. Some of the correspondence between printer Benj. Motte and Gulliver's also-fictional cousin negotiating the book's publication has survived. Though it has often been mistakenly thought of and published in [[bowdlerised]] form as a children's book, it is a great and sophisticated satire of human nature based on Swift's experience of his times. ''Gulliver's Travels'' is an anatomy of human nature, a sardonic looking-glass, often criticised for its apparent misanthropy. It asks its readers to refute it, to deny that it has adequately characterised human nature and society. Each of the four books\u2014recounting four voyages to mostly fictional exotic lands\u2014has a different theme, but all are attempts to deflate human pride. Critics hail the work as a satiric reflection on the shortcomings of Enlightenment thought.\n\nIn 1729, Swift published ''[[A Modest Proposal|A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland Being a Burden on Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick]]'', a satire in which the narrator, with intentionally grotesque arguments, recommends that Ireland's poor escape their poverty by selling their children as food to the rich: \"I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food...\" Following the satirical form, he introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by deriding them:\n<blockquote>Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients...taxing our absentees...using [nothing] except what is of our own growth and manufacture...rejecting...foreign luxury...introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance...learning to love our country...quitting our animosities and factions...teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants....Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Swift |first1=Jonathan |title=A Modest Proposal |date=2015 |publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=9780141398181 |page=29 |accessdate=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Essays, tracts, pamphlets, periodicals===\n[[File:CBI - Series B - Ten pound note.jpg|right|frame|Swift as depicted on the [[Series B Banknotes (Ireland)|Irish \u00a310 banknote]], issued 1976\u20131993]]\n* \"A Meditation upon a Broom-stick\" (1703\u20131710): Full text: [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16126/16126-h/16126-h.htm#xxviii Project Gutenberg]\n* \"A Tritical Essay upon the Faculties of the Mind\" (1707\u20131711): Full text: [http://jonathanswiftarchive.org.uk/browse/year/text_4_2_2.html Jonathan Swift Archives, King's College London]<ref>This work is often wrongly referred to as \"A Critical Essay upon the Faculties of the Mind\".</ref>\n* The Bickerstaff-Partridge Papers (1708\u20131709): Full text: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080118185815/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/s/swift/jonathan/s97b/ U of Adelaide]\n* \"[[An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity]]\" (1708\u20131711): Full text: [https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/swift/jonathan/s97ab/ U of Adelaide]\n* ''The Intelligencer'' (with [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]]) (1719\u20131788): Text: [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13169 Project Gutenberg]\n* ''The Examiner'' (1710): Texts: [http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/swift/examiner/index.htm Ourcivilisation.com], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13169 Project Gutenberg]\n* \"A Proposal for Correcting, Improving and Ascertaining the English Tongue\" (1712): Full texts: [http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/proposal.html Jack Lynch], [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/ot2www-pubeng?specfile=/texts/english/modeng/publicsearch/modengpub.o2w&act=text&offset=607794346&textreg=3&query=&id= U of Virginia]\n* \"On the Conduct of the Allies\" (1711)\n* \"Hints Toward an Essay on Conversation\" (1713): Full text: [http://www.bartleby.com/27/8.html Bartleby.com]\n* \"A Letter to a Young Gentleman, Lately Entered into Holy Orders\" (1720)\n* \"A Letter of Advice to a Young Poet\" (1721): Full text: [http://www.bartleby.com/27/10.html Bartleby.com]\n* ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'' (1724, 1725): Full text: [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12784 Project Gutenberg]\n* \"Bon Mots de Stella\" (1726): a curiously irrelevant appendix to \"Gulliver's Travels\"\n* \"[[A Modest Proposal]]\", perhaps the most notable satire in English, suggesting that the Irish should engage in cannibalism.

The lyrics Biafra wrote helped popularize the use of humorous lyrics in punk and other types of hard-core music. Biafra cites [[Joey Ramone]] as the inspiration for his use of humor in his songs (as well as being the musician who made him interested in punk rock), noting in particular songs by [[The Ramones]] such as \"[[Beat on the Brat]]\" and \"[[Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue]]\".<ref>Biafra, Jello. \"Joey Ramone.\" ''Machine Gun in the Clown's Hand''.

In 1993 he gave an interview to [[RE/Search|RE/Search Publications]] for their second ''Incredibly Strange Music'' book focusing primarily on these records, and later participated in a two-part episode of [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse TV]]'s program ''Crate Diggers'' on the same subject.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jeEEwSQZoQ</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu2_SJcbWNE</ref> His interest in such recordings, often categorized as [[outsider music]], led to his discovery of the prolific (and schizophrenic) singer/songwriter/artist [[Wesley Willis]], whom he signed to Alternative Tentacles in 1994, preceding Willis' major label deal with [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]]. His collection grew so large that on October 1, 2005, Biafra donated a portion of his collection to an annual yard sale co-promoted by Alternative Tentacles and held at their warehouse in [[Emeryville, California]].<ref name=\"yardsale\">{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativetentacles.com/news.php?page=3&news_section=MAIN&window_size=15&sd=E206Wu3H9XDt8-nfY3f |title=News |publisher=Alternative Tentacles |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, along with Alternative Tentacles employee and [[The Frisk]] lead singer Jesse Luscious, Biafra began co-hosting ''The Alternative Tentacles Batcast'', a downloadable [[podcast]] hosted by alternativetentacles.com.

In his performance he combined humor with his political beliefs, much in the same way that he did with the lyrics to his songs. Despite his continued spoken word performances, he did not begin recording spoken word albums until after the disbanding of the Dead Kennedys.\n\nHis ninth spoken word album, ''[[In the Grip of Official Treason]]'', was released in October 2006.\n\nBiafra was also featured in the British band [[Pitchshifter]]'s song ''[[Deviant (Pitchshifter album)|As Seen on TV]]'' reciting the words of dystopian futuristic radio advertisements.\n\n==Politics==\n\nBiafra was an anarchist in the 1980s, but has shifted away from his former anti-government views. In a 2012 interview, Biafra said \"I'm very pro-tax as long as it goes for the right things.

He also made a whistlestop campaign tour along the [[BART]] line.

In 1926, Grierson coined the term [[Documentary#Defining documentary|\"documentary\"]] in a review of [[Robert J. Flaherty|Robert Flaherty's]] ''[[Moana (1926 film)|Moana]]''.<ref name=RFL>[[Ann Curthoys]], [[Marilyn Lake]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=JE6YM8jcRucC&pg=PA151&dq=john+grierson+documentary+1926&hl=en&ei=5wkUTcb5OMq7hAeixPW2Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=john%20grierson%20documentary%201926&f=false Connected worlds: history in transnational perspective, Volume 2004] p.151. Australian National University Press</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nGrierson was born in the old schoolhouse in [[Deanston]], near [[Doune]], [[Scotland]], to his father a schoolmaster Robert Morrison Grierson from Boddam, near [[Peterhead]] and mother Jane Anthony a teacher from [[Ayrshire]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=John Grierson: A Documentary Biography|last=Hardy|first=Forsyth|publisher=Faber and Faber|year=1979|isbn=0-571-10331-6|location=University of Stirling Archives|pages=11-262}}</ref>. His mother a [[suffragette]] and ardent [[UK Labour Party|Labour Party]] activist, she often took the chair at [[Tom Johnston (British politician)|Tom Johnston's]] election meetings<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nThe family moved to [[Cambusbarron]], [[Stirling]] in 1900, when the children were still young after Grierson's father was appointed headmaster of Cambusbarron school<ref>{{Cite book|title=John Grierson: Film Master|last=Beveridge|first=James|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc.|year=1978|isbn=0-02-510530-2|location=University of Stirling Archives|pages=3-336}}</ref>. When the family moved, John had three elder sisters Agnes, Janet and Margaret, and a younger brother called Anthony<ref name=\":0\" />. John and Anthony were enrolled at Cambusbarron school in November 1903, his sister Margaret died in 1906; however, the family continued to grow as John gained three younger sisters in Dorothy, Ruby and Marion<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nFrom an early age, both parents steeped their son in [[Liberalism|liberal]] politics, [[humanistic]] ideals, and [[Calvinist]] moral and religious philosophies, particularly the notion that education was essential to individual freedom and that hard and meaningful work was the way to prove oneself worthy in the sight of God<ref name=\":1\" />. John was enrolled in the High School at Stirling in September 1908, where he played football and rugby for the school<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\n=== World War I ===\nIn July 1915, he left school with an overall subject mark of 82%; John had sat the bursary examination at Gilmorehill the month before as his parents wanted him to follow his elder sisters, Janet and Agnes in going to the [[University of Glasgow]]<ref name=\":0\" />. The results for the bursary examination were not posted until October 1915; John applied to work at the munitions at [[Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire|Alexandria]], the munitions building had been the original home of the Argyll Motor Company which had earlier in the twentieth century built the first complete motor car in Scotland<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nJohn Grierson was the second name on the bursary list and received the John Clark bursary which was tenable for four years<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson entered the University of Glasgow in 1916;<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|title=University of Glasgow Story|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH2035&type=P&o=&start=0&max=20&l=|accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref> however, he was unhappy with his efforts to help in [[World War I]] were only through his work at the munitions<ref name=\":0\" />. John wanted to join the navy, his family on his father's side had long been lighthouse keepers, and John had many memories of visiting lighthouses and being beside the sea<ref name=\":0\" />. John went to the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace]], [[London]] to train with the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]], in his recruitment letter he had added an extra year so that he could attend<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nOn 7 January 1916, John was sent to the wireless telegraphy station at [[Aultbea]], [[Cromarty]] as an ordinary [[telegraphist]] but was promoted to telegraphist on 2 June 1916<ref name=\":0\" />.  On 23 January 1917, he became a telegraphist on the [[minesweeper]] H.M.S ''Surf'' and served there until 13 October 1917, the next day he joined H.M.S ''Rightwhale'' where he was promoted to leading telegraphist on 2 June 1918, and remained on the vessel until he was demobilised<ref name=\":0\" />. John walked away from his time in the navy with a [[British War Medal]] and the [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]]<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\n=== University of Glasgow ===\nJohn returned to University in 1919, he joined the Fabian Society in 1919 and dissolved it in 1921<ref name=\":0\" />. The New University Labour Club was initiated by John as well as the Critic's Club; he also had poetry published in the Glasgow University magazine from November 1920 until February 1923<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson received the Buchan Prize in the Ordinary Class of English Language in the academic year of 1919-20, he also received the prize and first-class certificate in the academic year of 1920-21 in the Ordinary Class of Moral Philosophy and graduated with a Master of Arts in English and Moral Philosophy in 1923<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nIn 1923, he received a [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller Research Fellowship]] to study in the United States at the [[University of Chicago]], and later at Columbia and the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]].{{fact|date=June 2018}} His research focus was the [[psychology]] of [[propaganda]]\u2014the impact of the press, film, and other mass media on forming public opinion.{{fact|date=June 2018}}  Grierson was particularly interested in the popular appeal and influence of the [[yellow journalism|\"yellow\" (tabloid) press]], and the influence and role of these journals on the education of new American citizens from abroad.{{fact|date=June 2018}}\n\n== Social critic ==\nIn his review of [[Robert Flaherty]]'s film ''[[Moana (1926 film)|Moana]]'' (1926) in the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' (8 February 1926), Grierson wrote that it had 'documentary' value.<ref name=RFL/><ref>[http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/?p=16639 1975 Review of Moana, by Jonathan Rosenbaum]</ref>\nIn his essay \"First Principles of Documentary\" (1932), Grierson argued that the principles of documentary were that cinema's potential for observing life could be exploited in a new art form; that the \"original\" actor and \"original\" scene are better guides than their fiction counterparts to interpreting the modern world; and that materials \"thus taken from the raw\" can be more real than the acted article. In this regard, Grierson's views align with the Soviet filmmaker [[Dziga Vertov]]'s contempt for dramatic fiction as \"bourgeois excess\", though with considerably more subtlety. Grierson's definition of documentary as \"creative treatment of actuality\" has gained some acceptance, though it presents philosophical questions about documentaries containing stagings and reenactments.\n\nLike many social critics of the time, Grierson was profoundly concerned about what he perceived to be clear threats to democracy.  In the US, he encountered a marked tendency toward political reaction, anti-democratic sentiments, and political apathy.  He read and agreed with the journalist and political philosopher [[Walter Lippmann]]'s book ''Public Opinion'' which blamed the erosion of democracy in part on the fact that the political and social complexities of contemporary society made it difficult if not impossible for the public to comprehend and respond to issues vital to the maintenance of democratic society.\n\nIn Grierson's view,  a way to counter these problems was to involve citizens in their government with the kind of engaging excitement generated by the popular press, which simplified and dramatized public affairs.  It was during this time that Grierson developed a conviction that motion pictures could play a central role in promoting this process.  (It has been suggested [by whom?] that some of Grierson's notions regarding the social and political uses of film were influenced by reading [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] writing about film as education and propaganda.)\n\nGrierson's emerging view of film was as a form of social and political communication\u2014a mechanism for social reform, education, and perhaps spiritual uplift.  His view of Hollywood movie-making was considerably less sanguine:\n\n:\"In an age when the faiths, the loyalties, and the purposes have been more than usually undermined, mental fatigue--or is it spiritual fatigue?--represents a large factor in everyday experience.  Our cinema magnate does no more than exploit the occasion.  He also, more or less frankly, is a [[cannabis (drug)|dope]] pedlar.\"\n\n== Film critic ==\nGrierson's emerging and outspoken film philosophies caught the attention of [[New York City|New York]] film critics at the time.  He was asked to write criticism for the ''[[New York Sun]]''. At the ''Sun'', Grierson wrote articles on film aesthetics and audience reception, and developed broad contacts in the film world. According to popular myth, in the course of this writing stint, Grierson coined the term \"documentary\" in writing about [[Robert J. Flaherty]]'s film ''[[Moana (1926 film)|Moana]]'' (1926): \"Of course ''Moana'', being a visual account of events in the daily life of a Polynesian youth and his family, has documentary value.\"<ref>''New York Sun'', 8 February 1926.</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Grierson was also involved in scrutinizing the film industries of other countries. He may have been involved in arranging to bring [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s groundbreaking film ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925) to US audiences for the first time.  Eisenstein's editing techniques and film theories, particularly the use of montage, would have a significant influence on Grierson's own work.\n\n== Filmmaker ==\nGrierson returned to Great Britain in 1927 armed with the sense that film could be enlisted to deal with the problems of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]], and to build national morale and national consensus.  Filmmaking for Grierson was an exalted calling; the Filmmaker a patriot. In all of this, there was more than a little elitism, a stance reflected in Grierson's many dicta of the time:  \"The elect have their duty.\"  \"I look on cinema as a pulpit, and use it as a propagandist.\"\n\nIn the US Grierson had met pioneering documentary filmmaker [[Robert Flaherty]]. Grierson respected Flaherty immensely for his contributions to documentary form and his attempts to use the camera to bring alive the lives of everyday people and everyday events.  Less commendable in Grierson's view was Flaherty's focus on exotic and faraway cultures. (\"In the profounder kind of way\", wrote Grierson of Flaherty, \"we live and prosper each of us by denouncing the other\"). In Grierson's view, the focus of film should be on the everyday drama of ordinary people. As Grierson wrote in his diaries: \"Beware the ends of the earth and the exotic: the drama is on your doorstep wherever the slums; are, wherever there is malnutrition, wherever there is exploitation and cruelty.\" \"'You keep your savages in the far place Bob; we are going after the savages of Birmingham,' I think I said to him pretty early on. And we did.\")\n\n=== Empire Marketing Board ===\nOn his return to England, Grierson was employed on a temporary basis as an Assistant Films Officer of the [[Empire Marketing Board]] (EMB), a governmental agency which had been established in 1926 to promote British world trade and British unity throughout the [[British Empire|empire]]. One of the major functions of the EMB was publicity, which the Board accomplished through exhibits, posters, and publications and films. It was within the context of this State-funded organization that the \"documentary\" as we know it today got its start.\n\nIn late 1929 Grierson and his cameraman, [[Basil Emmott]] completed his first film, ''[[Drifters (1929 film)|Drifters]]'', which he wrote, produced and directed. The film, which follows the heroic work of [[North Sea]] herring fishermen, was a radical departure from anything being made by the British film industry or Hollywood. A large part of its innovation lies in the fierce boldness in bringing the camera to rugged locations such as a small boat in the middle of a gale while leaving relatively less of the action staged. The choice of topic was chosen less from Grierson's curiosity than the fact that he discovered that the Financial Secretary had made the herring industry his hobbyhorse. It premiered in a private film club in London in November 1929 on a double-bill with [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein's]] -then controversial- film ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' (which was banned from general release in Britain until 1954) and received high praise from both its sponsors and the press. The film was shown from 9 December 1929, in the Stoll in Kingsway and then was later screened throughout Britain<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nAfter this success, Grierson moved away from film direction into a greater focus on production and administration within the EMB. He became a tireless organizer and recruiter for the EMB, enlisting a stable of energetic young filmmakers into the film unit between 1930 and 1933. Those enlisted included filmmakers [[Basil Wright]], [[Edgar Anstey]], [[Stuart Legg]], [[Paul Rotha]], [[Sir Arthur Elton, 10th Baronet|Arthur Elton]], [[Humphrey Jennings]], [[Harry Watt (director)|Harry Watt]], and [[Alberto Cavalcanti]]. This group formed the core of what was to become known as the British [[Documentary Film Movement]]. [[Robert Flaherty]] himself also worked briefly for the unit. In 1933 the EMB Film Unit was disbanded, a casualty of Depression-era economics.\n\n=== General Post Office ===\nGrierson's boss at the EMB moved to the [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]] (GPO) as its first public relations officer, with the stipulation that he could bring the EMB film unit with him. Grierson's crew were charged with demonstrating how the Post Office facilitated modern communication and brought the nation together, a task aimed as much at GPO workers as the general public.  During Grierson's administration, the [[GPO Film Unit]] produced a series of groundbreaking films, including ''[[Night Mail]]'' (dir. [[Basil Wright]] and [[Harry Watt (director)|Harry Watt]], 1936) and ''[[Coal Face]]'' (dir. [[Alberto Cavalcanti]], 1935). In 1934 he produced at the GPO Film Unit the award-winning ''[[The Song of Ceylon]]'' (dir. [[Basil Wright]]) which was sponsored jointly by the Ceylon Tea Propaganda Bureau and the EMB. \n\nIn 1934, Grierson sailed on the ''Isabella Greig'' out of [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton]] to film ''[[Granton Trawler]]'' on [[Viking Bergen Island|Viking Bank]] which is between [[Shetland]] and the Norwegian coast<ref name=\":0\" />. The footage from his voyage was handed over to [[Edgar Anstey]], who pulled footage of when the camera had fallen over on the deck of the boat to create a storm scene<ref name=\":0\" />. ''Granton Trawler'' was a favourite film of Grierson's, he saw it as a homage to the ''Isabella Greig'' that was sunk in 1941 by German bombs when it went out to fish and was never seen again<ref name=\":0\" />. ''[[The Private Life of the Gannets|The Private Life of Gannets]]'' was also filmed on the ''Isabella Greig;'' the film was shot on [[Grassholm]] with Grierson shooting the slow-motion sequence of the gannets diving for fish which took only one afternoon to shoot near [[Bass Rock]] in the Firth of Forth<ref name=\":0\" />. The Private Life of Gannets went on to pick up an Academy Award in 1937<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nGrierson eventually grew restless with having to work within the bureaucratic and budgetary confines of government sponsorship. Grierson resigned from the G.P.O. on 30 June 1937, which gave him more time to pursue his passions and the freedom to speak his mind on issues around the world<ref name=\":0\" />. In response, he sought out private industry sponsorship for film production. He was finally successful in getting the British gas industry to underwrite an annual film program.  Perhaps the most significant works produced during this time were ''Housing Problems'' (dir. [[Sir Arthur Elton, 10th Baronet|Arthur Elton]], [[Edgar Anstey]], [[John Taylor (documentary filmmaker)|John Taylor]], and Grierson's sister [[Ruby Grierson]], 1935).\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn 1938, Grierson was invited by the Canadian government to study the country's film production<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson sailed at the end of May in 1938 for [[Canada]] and arrived on 17 June<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson met with the Prime Minister, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and also spoke with many important figures across Canada, they were all in agreement of the importance of film in reducing sectionalism and in promoting the relationship of Canada between home and abroad<ref name=\":0\" />. The head of the Motion Picture Bureau for Canada, Frank Bagdley, did not appreciate Grierson's assessment and criticism of the films made by the Bureau which was that they focused too much on Canada as a place to holiday<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson delivered his report on government film propaganda and the weaknesses he had found in Canadian film production; his suggestion was to create a national coordinating body for the production of films<ref name=\":0\" />. An abridged version of the report ran to 66 pages, which was prepared by August in London<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson returned to Britain but was invited back to Canada on 14 October 1938; he returned in the November<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n==== National Film Board of Canada and Wartime Information Board ====\nIn 1939, Canada created the National Film Commission, which would later become the [[National Film Board of Canada]]. The bill to create a National Film Board was drafted by Grierson; the bill was introduced in March 1939 and given Royal Assent on 2 May 1939<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson was appointed the first Commissioner of the National Film Board in October 1939<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/john-grierson/|title=John Grierson|last=|first=|date=|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>. When Canada entered [[World War II]] in 1939, the NFB focused on the production of [[propaganda]] films, many of which Grierson directed. For example, captured footage of German war activity was incorporated in documentaries that were distributed to the then-neutral United States.\n\nGrierson grieved the death of his sister Ruby in 1940; she was on ''[[SS City of Benares|City of Benares]]'' while it was evacuating children to Canada<ref name=\":0\" />. ''The City of Benares'' was torpedoed, and of the 406 on board, only 248 survived<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson resigned from his position in January 1941, over his year as Commissioner at the National Film Board 40 films were made, the year before the Motion Picture Bureau had made only one and a half<ref name=\":0\" />. Recommendations for the future running were made for the National Film Board, and Grierson was persuaded to stay for a further six months to oversee the changes<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nDuring WW II, Grierson was a consultant to prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King as a minister of the [[Wartime Information Board]]. He remained on the National Film Board and managed to complete his duties to Wartime Information Board as well through his deputies that aided him in the task<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson was asked to keep his dual role until January 1944, however, he resigned in 1943 as the job he had been asked to complete had been finished as far as he was concerned<ref name=\":0\" />. Before he finished with the Wartime Information Bureau Grierson was also offered the role of chairman of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] but turned it down as he believed that this would give him too much power<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nOn 26 February 1942, Grierson attended the Academy Awards and received the award on behalf of the National Film Board for ''[[Churchill's Island]]''<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson also presented the award for the best documentary, the first time that this award was given by the Academy<ref name=\":0\" />. After the [[Dieppe Raid]], there were reports that Canadians that had been taken as prisoners of war had been manacled under Hitler's orders<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson proposed that the Film Board show how the German prisoners of war were being treated in Canada through a film. Ham Wright directed the film showing the German sailors that had been captured; plating football, enjoying meals and looking healthy<ref name=\":0\" />. Only one copy of the film was made, it was sent to the Swiss Red Cross who deliberately let it fall into German hands<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson was to learn at a later date that Hitler had indeed watched the film and ordered that the Canadian prisoners of war released from their manacles<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nAfter the war, the National Film Board focused on producing documentaries that reflected the lives of Canadians. The National Film Board has become recognized around the world for producing quality films, some of which have won [[Academy Awards]]. The National Film Board had become one of the largest film studios and was respected around the world for what it had achieved; it had especially had influence in Czechoslovakia and China<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn December 1943 Grierson was elected by the Permanent Film Committee of the National Council for Canadian-Soviet Friendship to become honorary chairman<ref name=\":0\" />. One of the tasks at the National Film Board that Grierson strongly pushed for the films being produced to be in French as well as English<ref name=\":0\" />. He also pushed for a French unit in the National Film Board<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nGrierson concentrated on documentary film production in New York after resigning his post following in August 1945; his resignation was to take effect in November 1945<ref name=\":0\" />. In 1946 Grierson was asked to testify regarding communist spies in the National Film Board and the Wartime Information Board, rumours spread that he had been a leader of a spy ring during his offices with the Canadian government, a rumour he denied<ref name=\":0\" />. Due to the rumours, the projects that Grierson had been trying to put together were not commissioned<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n=== Commission on Freedom of the Press ===\nGrierson was appointed as a foreign adviser to the Commission on Freedom of the Press in December 1943, which had been set up by the [[University of Chicago]]<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson was able to make a large contribution to the committee which included [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|Robert M. Hutchins]], [[William Ernest Hocking|William E. Hocking]], [[Harold Lasswell|Harold D. Lasswell]], [[Archibald MacLeish|Archibald McLeish]] and [[Charles Edward Merriam|Charles Merriam]]<ref name=\":0\" />. ''A Free and Responsible Press'' was published in 1947<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\n=== UNESCO ===\nGrierson was offered the position of head of information at [[UNESCO]] at the end of 1946; he attended the first General Conference of UNESCO from 26 November until 10 December in Paris<ref name=\":0\" />. He had the idea for the ''[[UNESCO Courier|Unesco Courier]]'' which was published in published in several languages across the world, first as a tabloid and later as a magazine<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson was invited to open the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] in 1947, from 31 August to 7 September<ref name=\":0\" />. At the start of 1948 he resigned from his position as director for Mass Communications and Public Information, he left in April to return to Britain<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n=== Central Office of Information ===\nIn February 1948, Grierson was appointed the controller of the [[Central Office of Information]]'s film operations to co-ordinate the work of the Crown Film Unit and Films Division, and to take overall charge of the planning, production and distribution of government films<ref name=\":0\" />. On 23 June 1948, he accepted an honorary degree, an LL.D from the University of Glasgow<ref name=\":0\" />. He left in 1950 due to financial restrictions on the documentaries that he wished to make<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n=== Group 3 ===\nGrierson was appointed to the position of executive producer of Group 3 at the end of 1950; it was a film production enterprise that received loans of government money through the [[National Film Finance Corporation]]<ref name=\":0\" />. They filmed at [[Southall Studios]] in [[West (London sub region)|West London]] but later moved to [[Beaconsfield Film Studios|Beaconsfield Studios]]<ref name=\":0\" />. Group 3 was to have continuous production from 1951 until 1955 when it stopped producing films, the organisation had made a loss of over \u00a3400,000 as production of the films usually ran over the time allocated, and there had also been difficulty getting the films shown in cinemas<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nDuring this time Grierson had been diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] in May 1953, he spent a fortnight in hospital and then had a year of convalescing at his home, Tog Hill in [[Calstone]]<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson spent much of his time corresponding with the directors at Group 3, as well as commenting on scripts and story ideas<ref name=\":0\" />. He had recovered enough to attend the Cannes Film Festival in April 1954, taking the production of ''Man of Africa''<ref name=\":0\" />. At the Edinburgh Film Festival in the same year, a dinner was held in Grierson's honour to celebrate twenty-five years of documentary<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\n=== Films of Scotland Committee ===\nGrierson joined the newly revived Films of Scotland Committee in 1955, also on the committee was [[Norman Wilson (film critic)|Norman Wilson]], [[Forsyth Hardy]], [[George Singleton]], C. A. Oakley and [[Neil Paterson (writer)|Neil Paterson]]<ref name=\":0\" />. In 1956, Grierson was the president of the [[Venice Film Festival]]'s jury; he was also jury president at the [[Cork Film Festival]]  and the [[South American Film Festival]] in 1958<ref name=\":0\" />. In 1957, Grierson received a special [[Canadian Film Award]]. Grierson wrote the script for, ''[[Seawards the Great Ships|Seawards the Great Ship]],'' it was directed by [[Hilary Harris]] and awarded an Academy Award in 1961, a feat for the Films of Scotland Committee<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\n=== This Wonderful World ===\nThe first programme of [[This Wonderful World]] was aired on 11 October 1957 in Scotland; it was on ''The Culbin Sands'' which focused on how the [[Forestry Commission]] had replanted six thousand acres of woodland along the mouth of [[Findhorn]]<ref name=\":0\" />. In the seventeenth century wild sand had blown into the mouth and covered the land, the successful replanting of the forest was a great success for the Commission<ref name=\":0\" />. This Wonderful World was shown weekly, other topics for episodes included [[Leonardo da Vinci]], ballet, [[King penguin|King Penguins]] and [[Norman McLaren]]'s ''[[Boogie-Doodle|Boogie Doodle]]''<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nThis Wonderful World began to be aired in England In February 1959, it ran for a further eight years and was in the Top Ten programmes for the week for the UK in 1960<ref name=\":0\" />. In 1961, Grierson was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the Queen's Birthday Honours<ref name=\":0\" />. In 1962, he was a member of the jury for the [[Vancouver International Film Festival|Vancouver Film Festival]], during his visit to Canada he also received the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts Medal for his contribution to the visual arts<ref name=\":0\" />. In 1963, he was busy with This Wonderful World and the Films of Scotland Committee but still found time to attend the twenty-fifth anniversary of the National Film Board in Montreal<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nIn 1965, Grierson was the patron of the [[Commonwealth Film Festival]] which took place in [[Cardiff]] in that year<ref name=\":0\" />. In 1966, he was offered the role of Governor of the [[British Film Institute]]; however, he turned down the position<ref name=\":0\" />. This Wonderful World changed the title to John Grierson Presents<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nIn 1967, after returning from the [[Oberhausen Film Festival]] where he had been the President of Honour of the jury, Grierson suffered a bout of [[bronchitis]] which lasted eight days<ref name=\":0\" />. His brother Anthony, who had trained to be a doctor was called and diagnosed Grierson with [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]], his coughing fits were a cause for concern, and he was admitted to [[Manor Hospital]]<ref name=\":0\" />. Grierson decided to give up smoking and drinking to benefit his health<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n=== Later Life ===\nGrierson opened the new primary school at Cambusbarron on 10 October 1967, his sister Dorothy attended the day with him<ref name=\":0\" />.

They raised money, rented camera, lenses, film stock and studio then shot it in 35&nbsp;mm. They dismantled the camera to understand how to operate it and spent the first half-day of the shoot trying to figure out how to get it running.\n\n==Early career==\nHe was the director, writer, producer, and production designer for ''Xenogenesis'' (1978). He then became an uncredited production assistant on ''[[Rock and Roll High School]]'' in 1979. While continuing to educate himself in filmmaking techniques, Cameron started working as a miniature model maker at [[Roger Corman]] Studios.<ref name=\"filmmakers.com\" /> Making rapidly produced, low-budget productions taught Cameron to work efficiently. He soon found employment as an art director in the sci-fi movie ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980). He did special effects work design and direction on John Carpenter's ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981), acted as production designer on ''[[Galaxy of Terror]]'' (1981), and consulted on the design of ''[[Android (film)|Android]]'' (1982).\n\nCameron was hired as the special effects director for the sequel to ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]'', entitled ''[[Piranha II: The Spawning]]'' in 1981. The original director, Miller Drake, left the project due to creative differences with producer [[Ovidio Assonitis]], who then gave Cameron his first job as director. The interior scenes were filmed in [[Rome, Italy]], while the underwater sequences were shot at [[Grand Cayman Island]].<ref name=\"amazingcameron.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazingcameron.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Amazingcameron.com |accessdate=February 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212021823/http://amazingcameron.com/biography.html |archivedate=December 12, 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe movie was to be produced in [[Jamaica]]. On location, production slowed due to numerous problems and adverse weather. James Cameron was fired after failing to get a close up of [[Carole Davis]] in her opening scene. Ovidio ordered Cameron to do the close-up the next day before he started on that day's shooting. Cameron spent the entire day sailing around the resort, reproducing the lighting but still failed to get the close-up. After he was fired, Ovidio invited Cameron to stay on location and assist in the shooting. Once in Rome, Ovidio took over the editing when Cameron was stricken with food poisoning. During his illness, Cameron had a nightmare about an invincible robot hitman sent from the future to kill him, giving him the idea for ''The Terminator'', which later catapulted his film career.<ref name=\"amazingcameron.com\" />\n\n==Major films==\n\n===''The Terminator'' (1984)===\n{{Main|The Terminator}}\n[[File:James Cameron.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cameron in September 1986]]\n\nAfter completing a screenplay for ''[[The Terminator]]'', Cameron decided to sell it so that he could direct the movie. However, the production companies he contacted, while expressing interest in the project, were unwilling to let a largely inexperienced feature film director make the movie. Finally, Cameron found a company called [[Hemdale Film Corporation|Hemdale Pictures]], which was willing to let him direct. [[Gale Anne Hurd]], who had started her own production company, [[Pacific Western Productions]], had previously worked with Cameron in Roger Corman's company and agreed to buy Cameron's screenplay for one dollar, on the condition that Cameron direct the film. Hurd was signed on as a producer, and Cameron finally got his first break as director. [[Orion Pictures]] distributed the film. Hurd and Cameron were married from 1985 to 1989.\n\nFor the role of the Terminator, Cameron envisioned a man who was not exceptionally muscular, who could \"blend into\" a crowd. [[Lance Henriksen]], who had starred in ''Piranha II: The Spawning'', was considered for the title role, but when [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and Cameron first met over lunch to discuss Schwarzenegger's playing the role of [[Kyle Reese]], both came to the conclusion that the [[cyborg]] villain would be the more compelling role for the Austrian [[bodybuilder]]; Henriksen got the smaller part of [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective Hal Vukovich and the role of [[Kyle Reese]] went to [[Michael Biehn]]. In addition, [[Linda Hamilton]] first appeared in this film in her iconic role of [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]], and later married Cameron.<ref name=jcbiog />\n\n''The Terminator'' was a box-office hit, breaking expectations by [[Orion Pictures]] executives that the film would be regarded as no more than a [[sci-fi film]], and then only last a week in theaters. It was a low-budget film which cost $6.5&nbsp;million to make, cutting expenses in such ways as recording the audio track in mono. However, ''The Terminator'' eventually earned over $78&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator.htm|title=The Terminator (1984)|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>\n\n===''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' (1985)===\n{{Main|Rambo: First Blood Part II}}\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Cameron wrote three screenplays simultaneously: ''The Terminator'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', and the first draft of ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''. While Cameron continued with ''The Terminator'' and ''Aliens'', [[Sylvester Stallone]] eventually took over the script of ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', creating a final draft which differed radically from Cameron's initial vision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazingcameron.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Amazingcameron.com |accessdate=August 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725030036/http://www.amazingcameron.com/biography.html |archivedate=July 25, 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===''Aliens'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Aliens (film)}}\n[[File:Gale Ann Hurd and James Cameron.jpg|thumb|upright|The producing team behind ''Aliens'', James Cameron and Gale Ann Hurd]]\n\nCameron next began the sequel to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', the 1979 film by [[Ridley Scott]]. Cameron named the sequel ''Aliens'' and again cast [[Sigourney Weaver]] in the iconic role of [[Ellen Ripley]]. According to Cameron, the crew on ''Aliens'' was hostile to him, regarding him as a poor substitute for Ridley Scott. Cameron sought to show them ''The Terminator'' but the majority of the crew refused to watch it and remained skeptical of his direction throughout production. Despite this and other off-screen problems (such as clashing with an uncooperative camera man and having to replace one of the lead actors when [[Michael Biehn]] of ''Terminator'' took [[James Remar]]'s place as Corporal Hicks), ''Aliens'' became a box-office success. It received [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Weaver, [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]], and won awards for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. In addition, the film and its lead actress made the cover of ''TIME'' magazine as a result of numerous and extensive scenes of women in combat; these were almost without precedent and expressed the [[feminism|feminist]] theme of the film very strongly.\n\n===''The Abyss'' (1989)===\n{{Main|The Abyss}}\n\nCameron's next project stemmed from an idea that had come up during a high school biology class. The story of oil-rig workers who discover otherworldly underwater creatures became the basis of Cameron's screenplay for ''[[The Abyss]]'', which cast [[Ed Harris]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] and [[Michael Biehn]]. Initially budgeted at $41&nbsp;million United States (though the production ran considerably over budget), it was considered to be one of the most expensive films of its time and required cutting-edge effects technology. Because much of the filming took place underwater and the technology wasn't advanced enough to digitally create an underwater environment, Cameron chose to shoot much of the movie \"reel-for-real\", at depths of up to {{convert|40|ft|m}}. For creation of the sets, the containment building of an unfinished nuclear power plant was converted, and two huge tanks were used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2010/11/james-cameron-best-movies.php |title=Flashback Five \u2013 James Cameron's Best Movies |publisher=Amctv.com |date=October 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107071253/http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2010/11/james-cameron-best-movies.php |archivedate=November 7, 2010 |df= }}</ref> The main tank was filled with {{convert|7500000|usgal|L}} of water and the second with {{convert|2500000|usgal|L}}.

Although Cameron had come up with a core idea for the sequel, and Schwarzenegger expressed interest in continuing the story, there were still problems regarding who had the rights to the story, as well as the logistics of the special effects needed to make the sequel. Finally, in the late-1980s, [[Mario Kassar]] of [[Carolco Pictures]] secured the rights to the sequel, allowing Cameron to greenlight production of the film, now called ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.\n\nFor the film, [[Linda Hamilton]] reprised her iconic role of Sarah Connor.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dougherty |first=Margot |title=A NEW BODY OF WORK &#124; Linda Hamilton &#124; Cover Story &#124; News + Notes &#124; Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Ew.com |date=July 12, 1991 |accessdate=August 27, 2010 |url=http://www.ew.com:80/ew/report/0,6115,314767_7%7C14651%7C%7C0_0_,00.html }}</ref> In addition, Schwarzenegger also returned in his role as The Terminator, but this time as a protector. Unlike Schwarzenegger's character\u2014the T-800 Terminator which is made of a metal endoskeleton\u2014the new villain of the sequel, called the [[T-1000]], is a more advanced Terminator made of liquid metal, and with polymorphic abilities. The T-1000 would also be much less bulky than the T-800. For the role, Cameron cast [[Robert Patrick]], a sharp contrast to Schwarzenegger. Cameron explained, \"I wanted someone who was extremely fast and agile. If the T-800 is a human [[Panzer tank]], then the T-1000 is a [[Porsche]].\"\n\nCameron had originally wanted to incorporate this advanced-model-Terminator into the first film, but the special effects at the time were not advanced enough. The ground-breaking effects used in ''The Abyss'' to digitally depict the water tentacle convinced Cameron that his liquid metal villain was now possible.\n\n[[TriStar Pictures]] agreed to distribute the film, but required a locked release date, intended to be about one year after the start of shooting. The movie, co-written by Cameron and his longtime friend, [[William Wisher Jr.]], had to go from screenplay to finished film in just that amount of time. Like Cameron's previous film, it was one of the most expensive films of its era, with a budget of about $100&nbsp;million. The biggest challenge of the movie was the special effects used in creating the T-1000. Nevertheless, the film was finished on time and released to theaters on July 3, 1991.\n\n''Terminator 2'', or ''T2'', as it was abbreviated, broke box-office records (including the opening weekend record for an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] film), earning over $200&nbsp;million in the United States and Canada, and over $300&nbsp;million in other territories, and became the highest-grossing film of that year. It won four [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Effects Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. It was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], but lost both Awards to ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''.\n\nJames Cameron announced a third ''Terminator'' film many times during the 1990s, but without coming out with any finished scripts. Kassar and Vajna purchased the rights to the Terminator franchise from a bankruptcy sale of Carolco's assets.<ref>{{Cite news|title=More 'Terminator' on the way|author=Michael Fleming|work=Variety|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117964592.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|accessdate=May 8, 2008 | date=May 9, 2007}}</ref> ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' was eventually made and released in July 2003 without Cameron's involvement. [[Jonathan Mostow]] directed the film and Schwarzenegger returned as the Terminator.\n\nCameron reunited with the main cast of ''Terminator 2'' to film ''[[T2 3-D: Battle Across Time]]'', an attraction at [[Universal Studios]] Florida, Universal Studios Hollywood, and Universal Studios Japan. It was released in 1996 and was a mini-sequel to ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day''. The show is in two parts: a prequel segment in which a spokesperson talks about Cyberdyne, and the main feature, in which the performers interact with a 3-D movie.\n\n===''True Lies'' (1994)===\n{{Main|True Lies}}\n\nBefore the release of ''T2'', Schwarzenegger came to Cameron with the idea of remaking the French comedy ''[[La Totale!]]'' Titled ''[[True Lies]]'', with filming beginning after ''T2''{{'}}s release, the story revolves around a secret-agent spy who leads a double life as a married man, whose wife believes he is a computer salesman. Schwarzenegger was cast as Harry Tasker, a spy charged with stopping a plan by a terrorist to use [[nuclear weapon]]s against the United States. [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] and [[Eliza Dushku]] played the character's family, and [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] the sidekick.\n\nCameron's Lightstorm Entertainment signed on with Twentieth Century Fox for the production of ''True Lies''. Made on a budget of $115&nbsp;million and released in 1994, the film earned $146&nbsp;million in North America, and $232&nbsp;million abroad.

This is unheard of for a widely released film, which is a testament to the movie's appeal. This was especially noteworthy, considering that the film's running time of more than three hours limited the number of showings each theater could schedule.

The ''Birkat Ha-Mitzwot'' evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed in the majority of these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are [[Theurgy|non-theurgic.]] And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a ''Berakah'' is said also at evil tidings.

According to Maimonides, any Jew who rejects even one of these principles would be considered an apostate and a heretic.<ref name=\"mesora\" /><ref name=\"Maimonides, 13 Principles of Faith\" /> Jewish scholars have held points of view diverging in various ways from Maimonides' principles.<ref name=\"learning\" /><ref name=\"The JPS guide to Jewish traditions\" />\n\nIn Maimonides' time, his list of tenets was criticized by [[Hasdai Crescas]] and [[Joseph Albo]]. Albo and [[Abraham ben David|the Raavad]] argued that Maimonides' principles contained too many items that, while true, were not fundamentals of the faith.\n\nAlong these lines, the ancient historian [[Josephus]] emphasized practices and observances rather than religious beliefs, associating [[apostasy]] with a failure to observe Jewish law and maintaining that the requirements for conversion to Judaism included [[circumcision]] and adherence to traditional customs. Maimonides' principles were largely ignored over the next few centuries.<ref name=\"medieval\" /> Later, two poetic restatements of these principles (\"''[[Ani Ma'amin]]''\" and \"''[[Yigdal]]''\") became integrated into many Jewish liturgies,<ref name=\"The Thirteen Principles of the Jewish Faith\" /> leading to their eventual near-universal acceptance.<ref name=\"What Do Jews Believe?\" /><ref name=\"traditions\" />\n\nIn modern times, Judaism lacks a centralized authority that would dictate an exact religious dogma.<ref name=\"religiousleadership\" /><ref name=\"judaism101beliefs\" /> Because of this, many different variations on the basic beliefs are considered within the scope of Judaism.<ref name=\"learning\" /> Even so, all [[Jewish religious movements]] are, to a greater or lesser extent, based on the principles of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and various commentaries such as the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]].

Even if to restrict the problem to the most influential intellectual trends of the nineteenth and twentieth century, the matter remains complicated. Thus for instance, [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik|Joseph Soloveitchik's]] (associated with the [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox movement]]) answer to modernity is constituted upon the identification of Judaism with following the [[halakha]] whereas its ultimate goal is to bring the holiness down to the world. [[Mordecai Kaplan]], the founder of the [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], abandons the idea of religion for the sake of identifying Judaism with [[civilization]] and by means of the latter term and secular translation of the core ideas, he tries to embrace as many Jewish denominations as possible. In turn, [[Solomon Schechter]]'s [[Conservative Judaism]] was identical with the tradition understood as the interpretation of Torah, in itself being the history of the constant updates and adjustment of the Law performed by means of the creative interpretation. Finally, [[David Philipson]] draws the outlines of the [[Reform Judaism|Reform movement]] in Judaism by opposing it to the strict and traditional rabbinical approach and thus comes to the conclusions similar to that of the Conservative movement.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/15006583/Some_Remarks_on_the_Self-Images_of_the_Modern_Judaism._Textual_Analysis|title=Some Remarks on the Self-Images of the Modern Judaism.

According to rabbinic tradition, there are [[613 mitzvot|613 commandments]] in the Torah. Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women, some only to the ancient priestly groups, the [[Kohen|Kohanim]] and [[Levite|Leviyim]] (members of the tribe of [[Levi]]), some only to farmers within the [[Land of Israel]]. Many laws were only applicable when the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] existed, and only 369 of these commandments are still applicable today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/541686/jewish/How-Many-of-the-Torahs-Commandments-Still-Apply.htm|title=How Many of the Torah's Commandments Still Apply?|last=Danzinger|first=Eliezer|website=Chabad.org|access-date=5 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile there have been Jewish groups whose beliefs were based on the written text of the Torah alone (e.g., the [[Sadducees]], and the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]]), most Jews believe in the [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|oral law]]. These oral traditions were transmitted by the [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] school of thought of ancient Judaism and were later recorded in written form and expanded upon by the rabbis.\n\nAccording to Rabbinical Jewish tradition, God gave both the Written Law (the [[Torah]]) and the [[Oral law]] to Moses on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. The Oral law is the oral tradition as relayed by God to Moses and from him, transmitted and taught to the sages ([[rabbi]]nic leaders) of each subsequent generation.\n\nFor centuries, the Torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in parallel with the oral tradition. Fearing that the oral teachings might be forgotten, Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] undertook the mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which became known as the ''Mishnah''.<ref>Codex Judaica Kantor 2006, page 146\" (as cited on [[Judah haNasi]])</ref>\n\nThe Mishnah consists of 63 tractates codifying Jewish law, which are the basis of the ''Talmud.'' According to [[Abraham ben David]], the ''[[Mishnah]]'' was compiled by Rabbi [[Judah the Prince|Judah haNasi]] after the destruction of Jerusalem, in [[anno mundi]] 3949, which corresponds to 189 CE.<ref>Abraham ben David, ''Seder Ha-Kabbalah Leharavad'', Jerusalem 1971, p.16 (Hebrew) (as cited on [[Judah haNasi]])</ref>\n\nOver the next four centuries, the Mishnah underwent discussion and debate in both of the world's major Jewish communities (in Israel and [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Babylonia]]). The commentaries from each of these communities were eventually compiled into the two [[Talmud]]s, the Jerusalem Talmud (''Talmud Yerushalmi'') and the Babylonian Talmud (''Talmud Bavli''). These have been further expounded by commentaries of various Torah scholars during the ages.\n\nIn the text of the Torah, many words are left undefined and many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions. Such phenomena are sometimes offered to validate the viewpoint that the Written Law has always been transmitted with a parallel oral tradition, illustrating the assumption that the reader is already familiar with the details from other, i.e., oral, sources.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aishdas.org/student/oral.htm|title=Proofs for the Oral Law|last=Student|first=Gil|date=|website=The AishDas Society|access-date=5 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nHalakha, the rabbinic Jewish way of life, then, is based on a combined reading of the Torah, and the oral tradition\u2014the Mishnah, the halakhic [[Midrash]], the Talmud and its commentaries. The Halakha has developed slowly, through a precedent-based system. The literature of questions to rabbis, and their considered answers, is referred to as [[responsa]] (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], ''Sheelot U-Teshuvot''.) Over time, as practices develop, codes of Jewish law are written that are based on the responsa; the most important code, the [[Shulchan Aruch]], largely determines Orthodox religious practice today.\n\n===Jewish philosophy===\n{{Main article|Jewish philosophy}}\nJewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of philosophy and Jewish theology. Major Jewish philosophers include [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Saadia Gaon]], [[Judah Halevi]], [[Maimonides]], and [[Gersonides]]. Major changes occurred in response to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (late 18th to early 19th century) leading to the post-Enlightenment Jewish philosophers. Modern Jewish philosophy consists of both Orthodox and non-Orthodox oriented philosophy. Notable among Orthodox Jewish philosophers are [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], and [[Yitzchok Hutner]]. Well-known non-Orthodox Jewish philosophers include [[Martin Buber]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]], [[Mordecai Kaplan]], [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], [[Will Herberg]], and [[Emmanuel L\u00e9vinas]].\n\n===Rabbinic hermeneutics===\n{{Quote box|width=35%|align=right|quote=13 Principles of Hermeneutics:\n\n# A law that operates under certain conditions will surely be operative in other situations where the same conditions are present in a more acute form\n# A law operating in one situation will also be operative in another situation if the text characterizes both situations in identical terms.\n# A law that clearly expresses the purpose it was meant to serve will also apply to other situations where the identical purpose may be served.\n# When a general rule is followed by illustrative particulars, only those particulars are to be embraced by it.\n# A law that begins with specifying particular cases, and then proceeds to an all-embracing generalization, is to be applied to particulars cases not specified but logically falling into the same generalization.\n# A law that begins with a generalization as to its intended applications, then continues with the specification of particular cases, and then concludes with a restatement of the generalization, can be applied only to the particular cases specified.\n# The rules about a generalization being followed or preceded by specifying particulars (rules 4 and 5) will not apply if it is apparent that the specification of the particular cases or the statement of the generalization is meant purely for achieving a greater clarity of language.\n# A particular case already covered in a generalization that is nevertheless treated separately suggests that the same particularized treatment be applied to all other cases which are covered in that generalization.\n# A penalty specified for a general category of wrongdoing is not to be automatically applied to a particular case that is withdrawn from the general rule to be specifically prohibited, but without any mention of the penalty.\n# A general prohibition followed by a specified penalty may be followed by a particular case, normally included in the generalization, with a modification in the penalty, either toward easing it or making it more severe.\n# A case logically falling into a general law but treated separately remains outside the provisions of the general law except in those instances where it is specifically included in them.\n# Obscurities in Biblical texts may be cleared up from the immediate context or from subsequently occurring passages\n# Contradictions in Biblical passages may be removed through the mediation of other passages.\n|source=\u2014[[Rabbi Ishmael|R. Ishmael]]<ref name=\"translated\" />|}}\n[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and many other [[Jews]] do not believe that the revealed [[Torah]] consists solely of its written contents, but of its interpretations as well. The study of [[Torah]] (in its widest sense, to include both poetry, narrative, and law, and both the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Talmud]]) is in Judaism itself a sacred act of central importance. For the sages of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]], and for their successors today, the study of Torah was therefore not merely a means to learn the contents of God's revelation, but an end in itself. According to the [[Talmud]],\n:These are the things for which a person enjoys the dividends in this world while the principal remains for the person to enjoy in the world to come; they are: honoring parents, loving deeds of kindness, and making peace between one person and another. But the study of the Torah is equal to them all. (Talmud Shabbat 127a).\nIn Judaism, \"the study of [[Torah]] can be a means of experiencing God\".<ref name=\"publishing3\" /> Reflecting on the contribution of the [[Amoraim]] and [[Tanaim]] to contemporary Judaism, Professor Jacob Neusner observed:\n:The rabbi's logical and rational inquiry is not mere logic-chopping. It is a most serious and substantive effort to locate in trivialities the fundamental principles of the revealed will of God to guide and sanctify the most specific and concrete actions in the workaday world .... Here is the mystery of Talmudic Judaism: the alien and remote conviction that the intellect is an instrument not of unbelief and desacralization but of sanctification.\"<ref name=\"invitation\" />\nTo study the Written Torah and the Oral Torah in light of each other is thus also to study ''how'' to study the word of God.\n\nIn the study of Torah, the sages formulated and followed various [[logic]]al and [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] principles. According to David Stern, all Rabbinic hermeneutics rest on two basic axioms:\n:first, the belief in the omni-significance of Scripture, in the meaningfulness of its every word, letter, even (according to one famous report) scribal flourish; second, the claim of the essential unity of Scripture as the expression of the single divine will.<ref name=\"indeterminacy\" />\nThese two principles make possible a great variety of interpretations. According to the Talmud,\n:A single verse has several meanings, but no two verses hold the same meaning. It was taught in the school of R. Ishmael: 'Behold, My word is like fire\u2014declares the Lord\u2014and like a hammer that shatters rock' (Jer 23:29). Just as this hammer produces many sparks (when it strikes the rock), so a single verse has several meanings.\" (Talmud Sanhedrin 34a).\nObservant Jews thus view the Torah as dynamic, because it contains within it a host of interpretations<ref name=\"indeterminacy4\" />\n\nAccording to Rabbinic tradition, all valid interpretations of the [[written Torah]] were revealed to Moses at Sinai in [[oral Torah|oral form]], and handed down from teacher to pupil (The oral revelation is in effect coextensive with the Talmud itself). When different rabbis forwarded conflicting interpretations, they sometimes appealed to hermeneutic principles to legitimize their arguments; some rabbis claim that these principles were themselves revealed by God to Moses at Sinai.<ref name=\"indeterminacy5\" />\n\nThus, [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] called attention to seven commonly used hermeneutical principles in the interpretation of laws ([[baraita]] at the beginning of [[Sifra]]); [[R. Ishmael]], thirteen (baraita at the beginning of Sifra; this collection is largely an amplification of that of Hillel).<ref name=\"introduction\" /> [[Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili]] listed 32, largely used for the exegesis of narrative elements of Torah. All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the [[Talmudim]] and [[Midrashim]] have been collected by [[Malbim]] in ''Ayyelet ha-Shachar'', the introduction to his commentary on the [[Sifra]]. Nevertheless, R.

It means rather \"the aggregate of all those characteristics that makes Judaeans Judaean (or Jews Jewish).\" Among these characteristics, to be sure, are practices and beliefs that we would today call \"religious,\" but these practices and beliefs are not the sole content of the term.

Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism's more than 3,000-year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West (that is, Europe, particularly medieval and modern Europe). During this time, Jews experienced slavery, anarchic and theocratic self-government, conquest, occupation, and exile. In the Diaspora, they were in contact with, and influenced by, ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenic cultures, as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment (see [[Haskalah]]) and the rise of nationalism, which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in their ancient homeland, the [[Land of Israel]]. They also saw an elite population convert to Judaism (the [[Khazar]]s), only to disappear as the centers of power in the lands once occupied by that elite fell to the people of Rus and then the Mongols.{{citation needed | reason= Boyarin does not say anything about Khazars is this synthesis?|date=April 2015}} Thus, Boyarin has argued that \"Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension.\"<ref name=\"A radical Jew: Paul and the politics of identity10\" />\n\nIn contrast to this point of view, practices such as [[Humanistic Judaism]] reject the religious aspects of Judaism, while retaining certain cultural traditions.\n\n===Who is a Jew?===\n{{Main article|Who is a Jew?}}\n\nAccording to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], a Jew is anyone who was either born of a Jewish mother or who [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]] in accordance with Jewish Law. [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] and the larger denominations of worldwide [[Reform Judaism|Progressive Judaism]] (also known as Liberal or Reform Judaism) accept the child as Jewish if one of the parents is Jewish, if the parents raise the child with a Jewish identity, but not the smaller regional branches.{{Clarify|date=December 2015}} All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, although conversion has traditionally been discouraged since the time of the Talmud. The conversion process is evaluated by an authority, and the convert is examined on his or her sincerity and knowledge.<ref name=\"Who is a Jew?\" /> Converts are called \"ben Abraham\" or \"bat Abraham\", (son or daughter of Abraham). Conversions have on occasion been overturned. In 2008, Israel's highest religious court invalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews, mostly from Russian immigrant families, even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi.<ref>Samuel G. Freedman, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/us/strains-grow-between-israel-and-many-jews-in-the-us.html \"Strains Grow Between Israel and Many Jews in the U.S.\"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 6 February 2015</ref>\n\nRabbinical Judaism maintains that a Jew, whether by birth or conversion, is a Jew forever. Thus a Jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another religion is still considered by traditional Judaism to be Jewish. According to some sources, the Reform movement has maintained that a Jew who has converted to another religion is no longer a Jew,<ref name=\"faqs\" /><ref name=\"university\" /> and the Israeli Government has also taken that stance after Supreme Court cases and statutes.<ref name=\"Law of Return 5710-1950\" /> However, the Reform movement has indicated that this is not so cut and dried, and different situations call for consideration and differing actions. For example, Jews who have converted under duress may be permitted to return to Judaism \"without any action on their part but their desire to rejoin the Jewish community\" and \"A proselyte who has become an apostate remains, nevertheless, a Jew\".<ref name=\"Jacob, Walter (1987). Contemporary American Reform Responsa. Mars, PA: Publishers Choice Book Mfg.\" />\n\n[[Karaite Judaism]] believes that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent. Although a minority of modern Karaites believe that Jewish identity requires that both parents be Jewish, and not only the father. They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml|title=Karaite FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions About Karaism|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe question of what determines Jewish identity in the State of Israel was given new impetus when, in the 1950s, [[David Ben-Gurion]] requested opinions on ''mihu Yehudi'' (\"Who is a Jew\") from Jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide in order to settle citizenship questions. This is still not settled, and occasionally resurfaces in [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]].\n\nHistorical definitions of [[Jewish identity]] have traditionally been based on ''[[halakha|halakhic]]'' definitions of matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions. Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the [[Oral Torah]] into the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], around 200 [[Common Era|CE]]. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 7:1\u20135, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarriage]] between Jews and [[Canaanites]] because \"[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others.\" {{bibleref2|Leviticus|24:10}} says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] man is \"of the community of Israel.\" This is complemented by {{bibleref2|Ezra|10:2\u20133}}, where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their [[gentile]] wives and their children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/10-11.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018024300/http://shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/10-11.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 October 1996|title=What is the origin of Matrilineal Descent?|accessdate=9 January 2009|date=4 September 2003|publisher=Shamash.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torah.org/qanda/seequanda.php?id=318 |title=What is the source of the law that a child is Jewish only if its mother is Jewish? |accessdate=9 January 2009 |publisher=Torah.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224205847/http://www.torah.org/qanda/seequanda.php?id=318 |archivedate=24 December 2008 }}</ref> A popular theory is that the rape of Jewish women in captivity brought about the law of Jewish identity being inherited through the maternal line, although scholars challenge this theory citing the Talmudic establishment of the law from the pre-exile period.<ref name=\"Klein2016\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BC_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA6|title=Lost Jews: The Struggle for Identity Today|author=Emma Klein|date=27 July 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-349-24319-8|pages=6\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Schott2010\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iFx-wHhMJMC&pg=PA67|title=Birth, Death, and Femininity: Philosophies of Embodiment|author=Robin May Schott|date=25 October 2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-00482-9|pages=67\u2013}}</ref> Since the anti-religious ''[[Haskalah]]'' movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries, ''halakhic'' interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.<ref>Dosick (2007), pp. 56\u201357.</ref>\n\n===Jewish demographics===\n{{Main|Jewish population by country}}\n\nThe total number of Jews worldwide is difficult to assess because the definition of \"who is a Jew\" is problematic; not all Jews identify themselves as Jewish, and some who identify as Jewish are not considered so by other Jews. According to the ''Jewish Year Book'' (1901), the global Jewish population in 1900 was around 11 million. The latest available data is from the World Jewish Population Survey of 2002 and the Jewish Year Calendar (2005). In 2002, according to the Jewish Population Survey, there were 13.3&nbsp;million Jews around the world. The Jewish Year Calendar cites 14.6&nbsp;million. Jewish population growth is currently near zero percent, with 0.3% growth from 2000 to 2001.\n\n==Jewish religious movements==\n{{Main article|Jewish religious movements}}\n\n===Rabbinic Judaism===\nRabbinic Judaism (or in some Christian traditions, Rabbinism) (Hebrew: \"Yahadut Rabanit\" \u2013 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e8\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea) has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 6th century CE, after the codification of the [[Talmud]]. It is characterised by the belief that the [[Written Torah]] (Written Law) cannot be correctly interpreted without reference to the [[Oral Torah]] and the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the [[halakha|Law]].\n\nThe [[Jewish Enlightenment]] of the late 18th century resulted in the division of [[Ashkenazi]] (Western) Jewry into religious movements or denominations, especially in North America and Anglophone countries. The main denominations today outside Israel (where the situation is rather different) are Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform.\n* [[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that both the Written and [[Oral Torah]] were divinely revealed to [[Moses]] and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging. Orthodox Jews generally consider commentaries on the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' (a condensed codification of halakha that largely favored Sephardic traditions) to be the definitive codification of Jewish law. Orthodoxy places a high importance on [[13 Principles of Faith|Maimonides' 13 principles]] as a definition of Jewish faith.\n:* Orthodoxy is often divided into [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Haredi Judaism]]. [[Haredi Judaism]] is less accommodating to modernity and has less interest in non-Jewish disciplines, and it may be distinguished from [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] in practice by its styles of dress and more stringent practices. Subsets of [[Haredi Judaism]] include [[Hasidic Judaism]], which is rooted in the [[Kabbalah]] and distinguished by reliance on a [[Rebbe]] or religious teacher; and [[Sephardic Haredi]] Judaism, which emerged among [[Sephardic]] (Asian and North African) Jews in Israel.\n* [[Conservative Judaism]] is characterized by a commitment to traditional Jewish laws and customs, including observance of [[Shabbat]] and [[kashrut]], a deliberately non-fundamentalist teaching of Jewish principles of faith, a positive attitude toward modern culture, and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic and modern scholarship when considering Jewish religious texts. Conservative Judaism teaches that Jewish law is not static, but has always developed in response to changing conditions. It holds that the Torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by God and reflecting his will, but rejects the Orthodox position that it was dictated by God to Moses.<ref name=\"Torah MiSinai:Conservative Views\" /><ref name=\"Conservative Judaism\" /> Conservative Judaism holds that the [[oral Torah|Oral Law]] is divine and normative, but holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions.\n* [[Reform Judaism]], called Liberal or Progressive Judaism in many countries, defines Judaism in relatively universalist terms, rejects most of the ritual and ceremonial laws of the [[Torah]] while observing moral laws, and emphasizes the ethical call of the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]]. Reform Judaism has developed an egalitarian prayer service in the vernacular (along with [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in many cases) and emphasizes personal connection to Jewish tradition.\n[[File:ReformJewishService.jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|right|A [[Reform Judaism|Reform synagogue]] with mixed seating and equal participation of men and women]]\n\n* [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], like Reform Judaism, does not hold that Jewish law, as such, requires observance, but unlike Reform, Reconstructionist thought emphasizes the role of the community in deciding what observances to follow.\n* [[Jewish Renewal]] is a recent North American movement which focuses on spirituality and social justice but does not address issues of Jewish law. Men and women participate equally in prayer.\n* [[Humanistic Judaism]] is a small non-theistic movement centered in North America and Israel that emphasizes Jewish culture and history as the sources of Jewish identity.\n\n====Sephardi and Mizrahi Judaism====\nWhile [[Minhag|traditions and customs]] (see also \"[[Sephardic law and customs]]\") vary between discrete communities, it can be said that [[Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi]] Jewish communities do not generally adhere to the \"movement\" framework popular in and among [[Ashkenazi]] Jewry.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Elazar|first1=Daniel|title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed?|url=http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm|website=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref> Historically, Sephardi and Mizrahi communities have eschewed denominations in favour of a \"big tent\" approach.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jager|first1=Elliot|title=Sephardi Judaism Straining to Stay Non-Denominational|url=https://www.jpost.com/Jerusalem-Report/Sephardi-Judaism-Straining-to-Stay-Non-Denominational-513181|website=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref> This is particularly the case in contemporary [[State of israel|Israel]], which is home to the largest communities of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews in the world. (However, individual Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews may be members of or attend synagogues that do adhere to one Ashkenazi-inflected movement or another.) \n\nSephardi and Mizrahi observance of Judaism tends toward the conservative, and [[Nusach#Sephardi_and_Mizrachi_nuschaot|prayer rites]] are reflective of this, with the text of each rite being largely unchanged since their respective inception. Observant Sephardim may follow the teachings of a particular rabbi or school of thought; for example, the Sephardic [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi of Israel]].\n\n====Jewish movements in Israel====\n{{Main article|Religion in Israel}}\nMost Jewish Israelis classify themselves as \"secular\" (''hiloni''), [[Masortim|\"traditional\" (''masorti'')]], \"religious\" (''dati'') or ''[[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]]''. The term \"secular\" is more popular as a self-description among Israeli families of western (European) origin, whose Jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their lives, but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief and practice. This portion of the population largely ignores organized religious life, be it of the official Israeli rabbinate (Orthodox) or of the liberal movements common to diaspora Judaism (Reform, Conservative).\n\nThe term \"traditional\" (''masorti'') is most common as a self-description among Israeli families of \"eastern\" origin (i.e., the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa). This term, as commonly used, has nothing to do with the [[Conservative Judaism]], which also names itself \"Masorti\" outside North America. There is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways \"secular\" and \"traditional\" are used in Israel: they often overlap, and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of worldview and practical religious observance. The term \"Orthodox\" is not popular in Israeli discourse, although the percentage of Jews who come under that category is far greater than in the [[Jewish Diaspora|diaspora]]. What would be called \"Orthodox\" in the diaspora includes what is commonly called ''dati'' (religious) or ''haredi'' (ultra-Orthodox) in Israel. The former term includes what is called \"[[Religious Zionism]]\" or the \"National Religious\" community, as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as ''haredi-leumi'' ([[nationalism|nationalist]] ''haredi''), or \"Hardal\", which combines a largely ''haredi'' lifestyle with nationalist ideology. (Some people, in [[Yiddish]], also refer to observant Orthodox Jews as ''frum'', as opposed to ''frei'' (more liberal Jews)).\n\n''Haredi'' applies to a populace that can be roughly divided into three separate groups along both ethnic and ideological lines: (1) \"Lithuanian\" (non-hasidic) ''haredim'' of [[Ashkenazim|Ashkenazic]] origin; (2) Hasidic ''haredim'' of Ashkenazic origin; and (3) [[Sephardim|Sephardic]] ''haredim''.\n\n===Karaites and Samaritans===\n[[Karaite Judaism]] defines itself as the remnants of the non-Rabbinic Jewish sects of the [[Second Temple]] period, such as the [[Sadducees]]. The Karaites (\"Scripturalists\") accept only the Hebrew Bible and what they view as the [[Peshat]] (\"simple\" meaning); they do not accept non-biblical writings as authoritative. Some European Karaites do not see themselves as part of the Jewish community at all, although most do.\n\nThe [[Samaritan]]s, a very small community located entirely around [[Mount Gerizim]] in the [[Nablus]]/[[Shechem]] region of the [[West Bank]] and in [[Holon]], near [[Tel Aviv]] in Israel, regard themselves as the descendants of the Israelites of the Iron Age [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]]. Their religious practices are based on the literal text of the written [[Torah]] (Five Books of Moses), which they view as the only authoritative scripture (with a special regard also for the [[Book of Joshua (Samaritan)|Samaritan Book of Joshua]]).\n\n===Haymanot (Ethiopian Judaism)===\n''See also: [[Haymanot]]; [[Beta Israel]].''\n\nHaymanot (meaning \"religion\" in Ge'ez and Amharic) refers the Judaism practiced by Ethiopian Jews. This version of Judaism differs substantially from Rabbinic, Karaite, and Samaritan Judaisms, Ethiopian Jews having diverged from their coreligionists earlier. Sacred scriptures (the Orit) are written in Ge'ez, not Hebrew, and dietary laws are based strictly on the text of the Orit, without explication from ancillary commentaries. Holidays also differ, with some Rabbinic holidays not observed in Ethiopian Jewish communities, and some additional holidays, like [[Sigd]].\n\n==Jewish observances==\n===Jewish ethics===\n{{Main article|Jewish ethics}}\nJewish ethics may be guided by [[halakhic]] traditions, by other moral principles, or by central Jewish virtues. Jewish ethical practice is typically understood to be marked by values such as justice, truth, peace, loving-kindness ([[chesed]]), compassion, humility, and self-respect. Specific Jewish ethical practices include practices of charity ([[tzedakah]]) and refraining from negative speech ([[lashon hara]]). Proper ethical practices regarding sexuality and many other issues are subjects of dispute among Jews.\n\n===Prayers===\n{{Main article|Jewish services}}\n[[File:YemeniJew1914.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.9|right|A Yemenite Jew at morning prayers, wearing a [[kippah]] skullcap, prayer shawl and [[tefillin]]]]\nTraditionally, Jews recite prayers three times daily, [[Shacharit]], [[Mincha]], and [[Ma'ariv]] with a fourth prayer, [[Mussaf]] added on [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|holidays]]. At the heart of each service is the ''[[Amidah]]'' or ''Shemoneh Esrei''. Another key prayer in many services is the declaration of faith, the ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'' (or ''Shema''). The ''Shema'' is the recitation of a verse from the Torah ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:4): ''Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad''\u2014\"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God! The Lord is One!\"\n\nMost of the prayers in a traditional Jewish service can be recited in solitary prayer, although communal prayer is preferred. Communal prayer requires a [[quorum]] of ten adult Jews, called a ''[[minyan]]''. In nearly all Orthodox and a few Conservative circles, only male Jews are counted toward a ''minyan''; most Conservative Jews and members of other Jewish denominations count female Jews as well.\n\nIn addition to prayer services, observant traditional Jews recite [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|prayers and benedictions]] throughout the day when [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Everyday prayers and blessings|performing various acts]]. Prayers are recited upon [[Modeh ani|waking up in the morning]], before eating or drinking different foods, [[Birkat Hamazon|after eating a meal]], and so on.\n\nThe approach to prayer varies among the Jewish denominations. Differences can include the texts of prayers, the frequency of prayer, the number of prayers recited at various religious events, the use of musical instruments and choral music, and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages or the vernacular. In general, Orthodox and Conservative congregations adhere most closely to tradition, and Reform and Reconstructionist synagogues are more likely to incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their services. Also, in most Conservative synagogues, and all Reform and Reconstructionist congregations, women participate in prayer services on an [[Egalitarianism|equal basis]] with men, including roles traditionally filled only by men, such as [[Torah reading|reading from the Torah]]. In addition, many Reform temples use musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs.\n\n===Religious clothing===\n{{Further|kippah|tzitzit|tefillin}}\nA ''[[kippah]]'' (Hebrew: \u05db\u05b4\u05bc\u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4, plural ''kippot''; Yiddish: \u05d9\u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05de\u05dc\u05e7\u05e2, ''yarmulke'') is a slightly rounded brimless skullcap worn by many Jews while praying, eating, reciting blessings, or studying Jewish religious texts, and at all times by some Jewish men. In Orthodox communities, only men wear kippot; in non-Orthodox communities, some women also wear kippot. ''Kippot'' range in size from a small round beanie that covers only the back of the head to a large, snug cap that covers the whole crown.\n\n''[[Tzitzit]]'' (Hebrew: \u05e6\u05b4\u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05b4\u05ea) ([[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi pronunciation]]: ''tzitzis'') are special knotted \"fringes\" or \"tassels\" found on the four corners of the ''[[tallit]]'' (Hebrew: \u05d8\u05b7\u05dc\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05ea) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: ''tallis''), or prayer [[shawl]]. The ''tallit'' is worn by Jewish men and some Jewish women during the prayer service. Customs vary regarding when a Jew begins wearing a tallit. In the Sephardi community, boys wear a tallit from bar mitzvah age. In some Ashkenazi communities, it is customary to wear one only after marriage. A ''tallit katan'' (small tallit) is a fringed garment worn under the clothing throughout the day. In some Orthodox circles, the fringes are allowed to hang freely outside the clothing.\n\n[[Tefillin]] (Hebrew: \u05ea\u05b0\u05e4\u05b4\u05dc\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df), known in English as phylacteries (from the Greek word \u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, meaning ''safeguard'' or ''amulet''), are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses, attached to the forehead and wound around the left arm by leather straps. They are worn during weekday morning prayer by observant Jewish men and some Jewish women.<ref name=\"publishers\" />\n\nA ''[[kittel]]'' (Yiddish: \u05e7\u05d9\u05d8\u05dc), a white knee-length overgarment, is worn by prayer leaders and some observant traditional Jews on the [[High Holidays]]. It is traditional for the head of the household to wear a kittel at the Passover seder in some communities, and some grooms wear one under the wedding canopy. Jewish males are buried in a ''tallit'' and sometimes also a ''kittel'' which are part of the ''[[tachrichim]]'' (burial garments).\n\n===Jewish holidays===\n{{Main article|Jewish holiday}}\nJewish holidays are special days in the Jewish calendar, which celebrate moments in Jewish history, as well as central themes in the relationship between God and the world, such as [[Creation myth|creation]], [[revelation]], and [[salvation|redemption]].\n\n====Shabbat====\n{{Main article|Shabbat}}\n\n[[File:Shabbat Challos.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Two braided Shabbat [[challah]]s placed under an embroidered [[challah cover]] at the start of the Shabbat meal]]\n''[[Shabbat]]'', the weekly day of rest lasting from shortly before sundown on Friday night to nightfall on Saturday night, commemorates God's day of rest after six days of creation.<ref name=\"shabbat\" /> It plays a pivotal role in Jewish practice and is governed by a large corpus of religious law. At sundown on Friday, the woman of the house welcomes the Shabbat by lighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing. The evening meal begins with the Kiddush, a blessing recited aloud over a cup of wine, and the Mohtzi, a blessing recited over the bread. It is customary to have [[challah]], two braided loaves of bread, on the table. During Shabbat, Jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|39 categories of ''melakhah'']], translated literally as \"work\". In fact the activities banned on the Sabbath are not \"work\" in the usual sense: They include such actions as lighting a fire, writing, using money and carrying in the public domain. The prohibition of lighting a fire has been extended in the modern era to driving a car, which involves burning fuel and using electricity.\n\n====Three pilgrimage festivals====\n{{Main article|Shalosh regalim}}\n\n[[File:Jerusalemsukkas.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Some [[sukkah|sukkot]] in Jerusalem]]\nJewish holy days (''chaggim''), celebrate landmark events in Jewish history, such as the Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah, and sometimes mark the change of seasons and transitions in the agricultural cycle. The three major festivals, Sukkot, Passover and Shavuot, are called \"regalim\" (derived from the Hebrew word \"regel\", or foot). On the three regalim, it was customary for the Israelites to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple.\n* [[Passover]] (''Pesach'') is a week-long holiday beginning on the evening of the 14th day of [[Nisan]] (the first month in the Hebrew calendar), that commemorates the [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt. Outside Israel, Passover is celebrated for eight days. In ancient times, it coincided with the barley harvest. It is the only holiday that centers on home-service, the [[Passover Seder|Seder]]. [[leavening agent|Leavened]] products ([[chametz]]) are removed from the house prior to the holiday and are not consumed throughout the week. Homes are thoroughly cleaned to ensure no bread or bread by-products remain, and a symbolic burning of the last vestiges of chametz is conducted on the morning of the Seder. [[Matzo]] is eaten instead of bread.\n* [[Shavuot]] (\"Pentecost\" or \"Feast of Weeks\") celebrates the revelation of the [[Torah]] to the [[Israelite]]s on Mount Sinai. Also known as the Festival of Bikurim, or first fruits, it coincided in biblical times with the wheat harvest. Shavuot customs include all-night study marathons known as Tikkun Leil Shavuot, eating dairy foods (cheesecake and blintzes are special favorites), reading the Book of Ruth, decorating homes and synagogues with greenery, and wearing white clothing, symbolizing purity.\n* [[Sukkot]] (\"Tabernacles\" or \"The Festival of Booths\") commemorates the Israelites' forty years of wandering through the desert on their way to the Promised Land. It is celebrated through the construction of temporary booths called ''sukkot'' (sing. ''[[sukkah]]'') that represent the temporary shelters of the Israelites during their wandering. It coincides with the fruit harvest and marks the end of the agricultural cycle. Jews around the world eat in ''sukkot'' for seven days and nights. Sukkot concludes with [[Shemini Atzeret]], where Jews begin to pray for rain and [[Simchat Torah]], \"Rejoicing of the Torah\", a holiday which marks reaching the end of the Torah reading cycle and beginning all over again. The occasion is celebrated with singing and dancing with the Torah scrolls. Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah are technically considered to be a separate holiday and not a part of Sukkot.\n\n====High Holy Days====\n[[File:Maurycy Gottlieb - Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''[[Yom Kippur]]'' by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]] (1878)]]\n{{Main article|High Holidays}}\nThe High Holidays (''Yamim Noraim'' or \"Days of Awe\") revolve around judgment and forgiveness.\n* [[Rosh Hashanah]], (also ''Yom Ha-Zikkaron'' or \"Day of Remembrance\", and ''Yom Teruah'', or \"Day of the Sounding of the [[Shofar]]\"). Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year (literally, \"head of the year\"), although it falls on the first day of the seventh month of the [[Hebrew calendar]], [[Tishri]]. Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the 10-day period of atonement leading up to Yom Kippur, during which Jews are commanded to search their souls and make amends for sins committed, intentionally or not, throughout the year. Holiday customs include blowing the shofar, or ram's horn, in the synagogue, eating apples and honey, and saying blessings over a variety of symbolic foods, such as pomegranates.\n* [[Yom Kippur]], (\"Day of Atonement\") is the holiest day of the Jewish year. It is a day of communal fasting and praying for forgiveness for one's sins. Observant Jews spend the entire day in the synagogue, sometimes with a short break in the afternoon, reciting prayers from a special holiday prayerbook called a \"Machzor\". Many non-religious Jews make a point of attending synagogue services and fasting on Yom Kippur. On the eve of Yom Kippur, before candles are lit, a prefast meal, the \"seuda mafseket\", is eaten. Synagogue services on the eve of Yom Kippur begin with the Kol Nidre prayer. It is customary to wear white on Yom Kippur, especially for Kol Nidre, and leather shoes are not worn. The following day, prayers are held from morning to evening. The final prayer service, called \"Ne'ilah\", ends with a long blast of the shofar.\n\n====Purim====\n{{Main article|Purim}}\n[[File:Jerusalem Purim street scene.jpg|right|thumb|Purim street scene in Jerusalem]]\n[[File:Pr\u00e9sentation de la Loi, Edouard Moyse (1860) - Mus\u00e9e d'art et d'histoire du Juda\u00efsme.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Torah]] reading, France, 1860 [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]\n[[Purim]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Audio|He-Purim.ogg|\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd}} ''P\u00fbr\u00eem'' \"[[Cleromancy|lots]]\") is a joyous Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the [[Persian Jews]] from the plot of the evil [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]], who sought to [[genocide|exterminate]] them, as recorded in the biblical [[Book of Esther]]. It is characterized by public recitation of the Book of Esther, mutual gifts of food and drink, [[Alms|charity]] to the poor, and a celebratory meal (Esther 9:22). Other customs include drinking wine, eating special pastries called [[hamantash]]en, dressing up in masks and costumes, and organizing carnivals and parties.\n\nPurim has celebrated annually on the 14th of the Hebrew month of [[Adar]], which occurs in February or March of the Gregorian calendar.\n\n====Hanukkah====\n{{Main article|Hanukkah}}\n\n[[Hanukkah]] ({{lang-he|\u05d7\u05b2\u05e0\u05bb\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4}}, \"dedication\") also known as the Festival of Lights, is an eight-day Jewish holiday that starts on the 25th day of [[Kislev]] ([[Hebrew calendar]]). The festival is observed in Jewish homes by the kindling of lights on each of the festival's eight nights, one on the first night, two on the second night and so on.\n\nThe holiday was called Hanukkah (meaning \"dedication\") because it marks the re-dedication of the Temple after its desecration by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]]. Spiritually, Hanukkah commemorates the \"Miracle of the Oil\". According to the Talmud, at the re-dedication of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] following the victory of the [[Maccabees]] over the [[Seleucid Empire]], there was only enough consecrated [[oil]] to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for one day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days \u2013 which was the length of time it took to press, prepare and consecrate new oil.\n\nHanukkah is not mentioned in the Bible and was never considered a major holiday in Judaism, but it has become much more visible and widely celebrated in modern times, mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and has national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the establishment of the State of Israel.\n\n====Fast days====\n{{Main article|Tisha B'Av|Seventeenth of Tamuz|10th of Tevet|Tzom Gedaliah}}\n[[Tisha B'Av]] ({{lang-he|\u05ea\u05e9\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d0\u05d1}} or {{lang|he|\u05d8\u05f3 \u05d1\u05d0\u05d1}}, \"the Ninth of [[Av (month)|Av]]\") is a day of mourning and fasting commemorating the destruction of the [[First Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple]]s, and in later times, the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Jews from Spain]].\n\nThere are three more minor Jewish fast days that commemorate various stages of the destruction of the Temples. They are the [[Seventeenth of Tamuz|17th Tamuz]], the [[10th of Tevet]] and [[Tzom Gedaliah]] (the 3rd of Tishrei).\n\n====Israeli holidays====\n{{Main article|Yom Hashoah|Yom Hazikaron|Yom Ha'atzmaut}}\nThe modern holidays of [[Yom Ha-shoah]] (Holocaust Remembrance Day), [[Yom Hazikaron]] (Israeli Memorial Day) and [[Yom Ha'atzmaut]] (Israeli Independence Day) commemorate the horrors of the [[Holocaust]], the fallen soldiers of Israel and victims of terrorism, and Israeli independence, respectively.\n\nThere are some who prefer to commemorate those who were killed in the Holocaust on the [[Tenth of Tevet#Day of general kaddish|10th of Tevet]].\n\n===Torah readings===\n{{Main article|Torah reading}}\nThe core of festival and [[Shabbat]] prayer services is the public reading of the [[Torah]], along with connected readings from the other books of the [[Tanakh]], called [[Haftarah]]. Over the course of a year, the whole Torah is read, with the cycle starting over in the autumn, on [[Simchat Torah]].\n\n===Synagogues and religious buildings===\n{{Main article|Synagogue}}\n[[File:Belz World Center Inside.jpg|right|thumb|Interior of the [[Belz Great Synagogue]] in Jerusalem.]]\n\nSynagogues are Jewish houses of prayer and study. They usually contain separate rooms for prayer (the main sanctuary), smaller rooms for study, and often an area for community or educational use. There is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. The Reform movement mostly refer to their synagogues as temples. Some traditional features of a synagogue are:\n* The [[ark (synagogue)|ark]] (called ''aron ha-kodesh'' by [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]] and ''hekhal'' by [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]]) where the [[Torah]] scrolls are kept (the ark is often closed with an ornate curtain (''[[parochet]]'') outside or inside the ark doors);\n* The elevated reader's platform (called ''[[Bema#Judaism|bimah]]'' by Ashkenazim and ''tebah'' by Sephardim), where the Torah is read (and services are conducted in Sephardi synagogues);\n* The [[sanctuary lamp|eternal light]] (''ner tamid''), a continually lit lamp or lantern used as a reminder of the constantly lit [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]\n* The pulpit, or ''amud'', a lectern facing the Ark where the [[hazzan]] or prayer leader stands while praying.\n\nIn addition to synagogues, other buildings of significance in Judaism include [[yeshiva]]s, or institutions of Jewish learning, and [[mikvah]]s, which are ritual baths.\n\n===Dietary laws: ''kashrut''===\n{{Main article|Kashrut}}\n\nThe Jewish dietary laws are known as ''[[kashrut]]''. Food prepared in accordance with them is termed [[kosher foods|kosher]], and food that is not kosher is also known as ''treifah'' or ''treif''. People who observe these laws are colloquially said to be \"keeping kosher\".<ref name=\"JewFAQ Kashrut\" />\n\nMany of the laws apply to animal-based foods. For example, in order to be considered kosher, [[mammals]] must have split [[hooves]] and [[ruminants|chew their cud]]. The [[pig]] is arguably the most well-known example of a non-kosher animal.<ref name=\"The Kosher Pig?\" /> Although it has split hooves, it does not chew its cud.<ref name=\"Tamar Levy, St. Louis, MO \u2013 Block Yeshiva High School, Grade 9\" /> For [[seafood]] to be kosher, the animal must have [[fins]] and [[Scale (zoology)|scales]]. Certain types of seafood, such as [[shellfish]], [[crustaceans]], and [[eel]]s, are therefore considered non-kosher. Concerning birds, a list of non-kosher species is given in the [[Torah]]. The exact [[translations]] of many of the species have not survived, and some non-kosher birds' identities are no longer certain. However, [[traditions]] exist about the ''kashrut'' status of a few birds. For example, both [[chickens]] and [[turkeys]] are permitted in most communities. Other types of animals, such as [[amphibians]], [[reptiles]], and most [[insects]], are prohibited altogether.<ref name=\"JewFAQ Kashrut\" />\n\nIn addition to the requirement that the species be considered kosher, meat and poultry (but not fish) must come from a healthy animal slaughtered in a process known as ''[[shechitah]]''. Without the proper [[Animal slaughter|slaughtering]] practices even an otherwise kosher animal will be rendered ''treif''. The slaughtering process is intended to be quick and relatively painless to the animal. Forbidden parts of animals include the [[blood]], some [[fat]]s, and the area in and around the [[sciatic nerve]].<ref name=\"JewFAQ Kashrut\" />\n\nJewish law also forbids the consumption of meat and dairy products together. The waiting period between eating meat and eating dairy varies by the order in which they are consumed and by community, and can extend for up to six hours. Based on the Biblical injunction against cooking a kid in its mother's milk, this rule is mostly derived from the [[Oral Torah]], the [[Talmud]] and [[Rabbinic law]].<ref name=\"JewFAQ Kashrut\" /> Chicken and other kosher birds are considered the same as meat under the laws of ''kashrut'', but the prohibition is Rabbinic, not Biblical.<ref name=\"shulchan\" />\n\nThe use of [[Dishware|dishes]], serving utensils, and [[oven]]s may make food ''treif'' that would otherwise be kosher. Utensils that have been used to prepare non-kosher food, or dishes that have held meat and are now used for dairy products, render the food ''treif'' under certain conditions.<ref name=\"JewFAQ Kashrut\" />\n\nFurthermore, all [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and some [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] authorities forbid the consumption of processed [[grape]] products made by non-Jews, due to ancient [[pagan]] practices of using wine in rituals.<ref name=\"JewFAQ Kashrut\" /> Some Conservative authorities permit wine and grape juice made without rabbinic supervision.<ref name=\"rabbinicalassembly\" />\n\nThe [[Torah]] does not give specific reasons for most of the laws of ''kashrut''.<ref name=\"JewFAQ Kashrut\" /> However, a number of explanations have been offered, including maintaining ritual purity, teaching impulse control, encouraging obedience to God, improving health, reducing [[cruelty to animals]] and preserving the distinctness of the Jewish community.<ref name=\"Kashrut Facts\" /> The various categories of dietary laws may have developed for different reasons, and some may exist for multiple reasons. For example, people are forbidden from consuming the blood of birds and mammals because, according to the Torah, this is where animal souls are contained.<ref name=\"Judaism 101: Kashrut: Jewish Dietary Laws\" /> In contrast, the Torah forbids Israelites from eating non-kosher species because \"they are unclean\".<ref name=\"leviticus11\" /> The [[Kabbalah]] describes sparks of holiness that are released by the act of eating kosher foods, but are too tightly bound in non-kosher foods to be released by eating.<ref name=\"Judaism and the Art of Eating\" />\n\nSurvival concerns supersede all the laws of ''kashrut'', as they do for most [[halakha|halakhot]].<ref name=\"jewishmag\" /><ref name=\"biu\" />\n\n===Laws of ritual purity===\n{{Main article|Tumah}}\n[[File:\u0428\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0438\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0442\u0438\u0458\u0430 - Shabbat matchbox holder.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|A silver matchbox holder for ritual use on [[Shabbat]] with inscription in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]]]\nThe [[Tanakh]] describes circumstances in which a person who is ''tahor'' or ritually pure may become ''tamei'' or ritually impure. Some of these circumstances are contact with human [[corpses]] or [[grave (burial)|graves]], seminal flux, vaginal flux, [[menstruation]], and contact with people who have become impure from any of these.<ref name=\"leviticus15\" /><ref name=\"bamidbar\" /> In Rabbinic Judaism, [[Kohanim]], members of the hereditary [[caste]] that served as [[priests]] in the time of the Temple, are mostly restricted from entering grave sites and touching dead bodies.<ref name=\"Torah tidbits\" /> During the Temple period, such priests ([[Kohanim]]) were required to eat their bread offering ([[Terumah]]) in a state of ritual purity, which laws eventually led to more rigid laws being enacted, such as [[Handwashing in Judaism|hand-washing]] which became a requisite of all Jews before consuming ordinary bread.\n\n====Family purity====\n[[File:Fauteuil de circoncision (\"Fauteuil d'Elie\").jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|18th-century circumcision chair [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]\n{{Main article|Niddah}}\n\nAn important subcategory of the ritual purity laws relates to the segregation of menstruating [[women]]. These laws are also known as ''[[niddah]]'', literally \"separation\", or family purity. Vital aspects of halakha for traditionally observant Jews, they are not usually followed by Jews in liberal denominations.<ref name=\"koshersex\" />\n\nEspecially in [[Orthodox Judaism]], the Biblical laws are augmented by Rabbinical injunctions. For example, the [[Torah]] mandates that a woman in her normal menstrual period must abstain from [[sexual intercourse]] for seven days. A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must continue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped.<ref name=leviticus15 /> The Rabbis conflated ordinary ''niddah'' with this extended menstrual period, known in the Torah as ''[[zavah]]'', and mandated that a woman may not have sexual intercourse with her [[husband]] from the time she begins her [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual]] flow until seven days after it ends. In addition, [[Rabbinical law]] forbids the [[husband]] from touching or sharing a bed with his wife during this period. Afterwards, purification can occur in a ritual bath called a [[mikveh]].<ref name=koshersex />\n\nTraditional [[Ethiopian Jews]] keep menstruating women in separate [[huts]] and, similar to [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite practice]], do not allow menstruating women into their [[temples]] because of a temple's special sanctity. Emigration to [[Israel]] and the influence of other Jewish denominations have led to Ethiopian Jews adopting more normative Jewish practices.<ref name=\"Karaites\" /><ref name=\"Women and water: menstruation in Jewish life and law\" />\n\n===Life-cycle events===\nLife-cycle events, or [[rites of passage]], occur throughout a Jew's life that serves to strengthen Jewish identity and bind him/her to the entire community.\n* [[Brit milah]]&nbsp;\u2013 Welcoming male babies into the covenant through the rite of [[circumcision]] on their eighth day of life. The baby boy is also given his Hebrew name in the ceremony. A naming ceremony intended as a parallel ritual for girls, named ''[[zeved habat]]'' or brit bat, enjoys limited popularity.\n* [[Bar Mitzvah / Bat Mitzvah|Bar mitzvah and Bat mitzvah]]&nbsp;\u2013 This passage from childhood to adulthood takes place when a female Jew is twelve and a male Jew is thirteen years old among Orthodox and some Conservative congregations. In the Reform movement, both girls and boys have their bat/bar mitzvah at age thirteen. This is often commemorated by having the new adults, male only in the Orthodox tradition, lead the congregation in prayer and publicly read a \"portion\" of the Torah.\n* [[Jewish views of marriage|Marriage]]&nbsp;\u2013 Marriage is an extremely important lifecycle event. A wedding takes place under a ''[[chuppah]]'', or wedding canopy, which symbolizes a happy house. At the end of the ceremony, the groom breaks a glass with his foot, symbolizing the continuous mourning for the destruction of the Temple, and the scattering of the Jewish people.\n* [[bereavement in Judaism|Death and Mourning]]&nbsp;\u2013 Judaism has a multi-staged [[mourning]] practice. The first stage is called the [[shiva (Judaism)|shiva]] (literally \"seven\", observed for one week) during which it is traditional to sit at home and be comforted by friends and family, the second is the ''shloshim'' (observed for one month) and for those who have lost one of their parents, there is a third stage, ''avelut yud bet chodesh'', which is observed for eleven months.\n\n==Community leadership==\n===Classical priesthood===\n[[File:Jewish Children with their Teacher in Samarkand.jpg|thumb|Jewish students with their teacher in [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]] c. 1910.]]\nThe role of the priesthood in Judaism has significantly diminished since the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE when priests attended to the Temple and sacrifices. The priesthood is an inherited position, and although priests no longer have any but ceremonial duties, they are still honored in many Jewish communities. Many Orthodox Jewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future [[Third Temple]] and need to remain in readiness for future duty.\n* [[Kohen]] (priest) \u2013 patrilineal descendant of [[Aaron]], brother of [[Moses]]. In the Temple, the ''kohanim'' were charged with performing the sacrifices. Today, a Kohen is the first one called up at the reading of the Torah, performs the [[Priestly Blessing]], as well as complying with other unique laws and ceremonies, including the ceremony of redemption of the first-born.\n* Levi ([[Levite]]) \u2013 Patrilineal descendant of [[Levi]] the son of [[Jacob]]. In the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], the levites sang [[Psalms]], performed construction, maintenance, janitorial, and guard duties, assisted the priests, and sometimes interpreted the law and Temple ritual to the public. Today, a Levite is called up second to the reading of the Torah.\n\n===Prayer leaders===\nFrom the time of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]] to the present, Judaism has required specialists or authorities for the practice of very few rituals or ceremonies. A Jew can fulfill most requirements for prayer by himself. Some activities\u2014reading the [[Torah]] and ''haftarah'' (a supplementary portion from the Prophets or Writings), the prayer for mourners, the blessings for bridegroom and bride, the complete grace after meals\u2014require a ''[[minyan]]'', the presence of ten Jews.\n\nThe most common professional clergy in a [[synagogue]] are:\n* [[Rabbi]] of a congregation \u2013 Jewish scholar who is charged with answering the legal questions of a congregation. This role requires ordination by the congregation's preferred authority (i.e., from a respected Orthodox rabbi or, if the congregation is Conservative or Reform, from academic seminaries). A congregation does not necessarily require a rabbi. Some congregations have a rabbi but also allow members of the congregation to act as ''shatz'' or ''baal kriyah'' (see below).\n** Hassidic ''[[Rebbe]]'' \u2013 rabbi who is the head of a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] dynasty.\n* [[Hazzan]] (note: the \"h\" denotes [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]]) (cantor) \u2013 a trained vocalist who acts as ''shatz''. Chosen for a good voice, knowledge of traditional tunes, understanding of the meaning of the prayers and sincerity in reciting them. A congregation does not need to have a dedicated hazzan.\n\nJewish prayer services do involve two specified roles, which are sometimes, but not always, filled by a rabbi or hazzan in many congregations. In other congregations these roles are filled on an ad-hoc basis by members of the congregation who lead portions of services on a rotating basis:\n* Shaliach tzibur or ''Shatz'' (leader\u2014literally \"agent\" or \"representative\"\u2014of the congregation) leads those assembled in prayer and sometimes prays on behalf of the community. When a ''shatz'' recites a prayer on behalf of the congregation, he is ''not'' acting as an intermediary but rather as a facilitator. The entire congregation participates in the recital of such prayers by saying ''amen'' at their conclusion; it is with this act that the ''shatz's'' prayer becomes the prayer of the congregation. Any adult capable of reciting the prayers clearly may act as ''shatz''. In Orthodox congregations and some Conservative congregations, only men can be prayer leaders, but all [[Progressive Judaism|Progressive]] communities now allow women to serve in this function.\n* The Baal kriyah or ''baal koreh'' (master of the reading) reads the weekly [[Torah]] portion. The requirements for being the ''baal kriyah'' are the same as those for the ''shatz''. These roles are not mutually exclusive. The same person is often qualified to fill more than one role and often does. Often there are several people capable of filling these roles and different services (or parts of services) will be led by each.\n\nMany congregations, especially larger ones, also rely on a:\n* [[Gabbai]] (sexton) \u2013 Calls people up to the Torah, appoints the ''shatz'' for each prayer session if there is no standard ''shatz'', and makes certain that the synagogue is kept clean and supplied.\n\nThe three preceding positions are usually voluntary and considered an honor. Since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] large synagogues have often adopted the practice of hiring rabbis and hazzans to act as ''shatz'' and ''baal kriyah'', and this is still typically the case in many Conservative and Reform congregations. However, in most Orthodox synagogues these positions are filled by laypeople on a rotating or ad-hoc basis. Although most congregations hire one or more Rabbis, the use of a professional hazzan is generally declining in American congregations, and the use of professionals for other offices is rarer still.\n\n===Specialized religious roles===\n* ''[[Beth din#Officers of a beth din|Dayan]]'' (judge) \u2013 An ordained rabbi with special legal training who belongs to a ''[[beth din]]'' (rabbinical court). In Israel, religious courts handle marriage and divorce cases, conversion and financial disputes in the Jewish community.\n* [[Mohel]] (circumciser) \u2013 An expert in the laws of circumcision who has received training from a previously qualified ''mohel'' and performs the ''[[brit milah]]'' (circumcision).\n* [[shechita|Shochet]] (ritual slaughterer) \u2013 In order for meat to be kosher, it must be slaughtered by a ''shochet'' who is an expert in the laws of kashrut and has been trained by another ''shochet.''\n* [[Sofer (scribe)|Sofer]] (scribe) \u2013 [[Torah]] scrolls, ''[[tefillin]]'' (phylacteries), ''[[mezuzah|mezuzot]]'' (scrolls put on doorposts), and ''gittin'' (bills of divorce) must be written by a ''sofer'' who is an expert in Hebrew calligraphy and has undergone rigorous training in the laws of writing sacred texts.\n* [[Rosh yeshiva]] \u2013 A Torah scholar who runs a [[yeshiva]].\n* [[Mashgiach ruchani|Mashgiach]] of a yeshiva \u2013 Depending on which yeshiva, might either be the person responsible for ensuring attendance and proper conduct, or even supervise the emotional and spiritual welfare of the students and give lectures on [[Mussar movement|mussar]] (Jewish ethics).\n* [[Mashgiach]] \u2013 Supervises manufacturers of kosher food, importers, caterers and restaurants to ensure that the food is kosher. Must be an expert in the laws of [[kashrut]] and trained by a rabbi, if not a rabbi himself.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|Jewish history}}\n{{About|the history of Judaism|the book on Ancient Judaism|Ancient Judaism (book)|section=yes}}\n\n===Origins===\n{{Main|Origins of Judaism}}\n{{Further|Ancient Canaanite religion|Ancient Semitic religion}}\n[[File:Duraeuropa-1-.gif|thumb|left|Scenes from the [[Book of Esther]] decorate the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] dating from 244 CE]]\nAt its core, the Tanakh is an account of the [[Israelite]]s' relationship with [[God]] from their earliest history until the building of the [[Second Temple]] (c. 535 BCE). [[Abraham]] is hailed as the first [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] and the father of the Jewish people. As a reward for his act of faith in one God, he was promised that [[Isaac]], his second son, would inherit the [[Land of Israel]] (then called [[Canaan]]). Later, the descendants of Isaac's son [[Jacob]] were enslaved in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and God commanded [[Moses]] to lead [[the Exodus]] from Egypt. At [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], they received the [[Torah]]\u2014the five books of Moses. These books, together with [[Nevi'im]] and [[Ketuvim]] are known as ''Torah Shebikhtav'' as opposed to the [[Oral Torah]], which refers to the Mishnah and the Talmud. Eventually, God led them to the [[land of Israel]] where the [[tabernacle]] was planted in the city of [[Shiloh (Biblical)|Shiloh]] for over 300 years to rally the nation against attacking enemies. As time went on, the spiritual level of the nation declined to the point that God allowed the [[Philistines]] to capture the tabernacle. The people of Israel then told [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] the [[prophet]] that they needed to be governed by a permanent king, and Samuel appointed [[Saul the King|Saul]] to be their King. When the people pressured Saul into going against a command conveyed to him by Samuel, God told Samuel to appoint [[David]] in his stead.\n\n[[File:Western wall jerusalem night.jpg|thumb|The [[Western Wall]] in [[Jerusalem]] is a remnant of the wall encircling the [[Second Temple]]. The [[Temple Mount]] is the holiest site in Judaism.]]\n\nOnce King David was established, he told the prophet [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]] that he would like to build a permanent temple, and as a reward for his actions, God promised David that he would allow his son, [[Solomon]], to build the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] and the throne would never depart from his children.\n\nRabbinic tradition holds that the details and interpretation of the law, which are called the ''[[Oral Torah]]'' or ''[[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|oral law]]'', were originally an unwritten tradition based upon what God told Moses on Mount Sinai. However, as the persecutions of the Jews increased and the details were in danger of being forgotten, these oral laws were recorded by [[Rabbi]] [[Judah HaNasi]] (Judah the Prince) in the [[Mishnah]], redacted ''circa'' 200 CE. The [[Talmud]] was a compilation of both the Mishnah and the [[Gemara]], rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries. The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship, [[Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina|Palestine]] and [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Babylonia]].<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14213-talmud|title=Talmud|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|author=Wilhelm Bacher}}</ref> Correspondingly, two bodies of analysis developed, and two works of Talmud were created. The older compilation is called the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. It was compiled sometime during the 4th century in [[Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina|Palestine]].<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia.com\"/> The Babylonian Talmud was compiled from discussions in the houses of study by the scholars [[Ravina I]], [[Ravina II]], and [[Rav Ashi]] by 500 CE, although it continued to be edited later.\n\nSome critical scholars oppose the view that the sacred texts, including the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], were divinely inspired. Many of these scholars accept the general principles of the [[documentary hypothesis]] and suggest that the [[Torah]] consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts.<ref name=\"yehezkal\" />{{page needed|date=July 2017}}<ref name=\"biblical\" /><ref name=\"speiser\" /> Many suggest that during the First Temple period, the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own god, but that their god was superior to other gods.<ref name=\"history\" />{{page needed|date=July 2017}}<ref name=\"history12\" />{{page needed|date=July 2017}} Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile, perhaps in reaction to [[Zoroastrian]] dualism.<ref name=\"ephraim\" /> In this view, it was only by the [[Hellenic period]] that most Jews came to believe that their god was the only god and that the notion of a clearly bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed.<ref name=\"beginnings\" />\n\n[[John Day (Old Testament scholar)|John Day]] argues that the origins of biblical [[Yahweh]], [[El (deity)|El]], [[Asherah]], and [[Ba'al]], may be rooted in earlier [[Canaanite religion]], which was centered on a pantheon of gods much like the [[Greek pantheon]].<ref name=\"goddesses\" />\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{Main article|Ancient Israel and Judah|Babylonian captivity|Hellenistic Judaism|Hasmonean Kingdom|Iudaea Province|Bar Kokhba revolt}}\n\nAccording to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[United Monarchy]] was established under [[Saul the King|Saul]] and continued under [[King David]] and [[Solomon]] with its capital in [[Jerusalem]]. After Solomon's reign, the nation split into two kingdoms, the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] (in the north) and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] (in the south). The Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the [[Assyria]]n ruler [[Sargon II]] in the late 8th century BCE with many people from the capital Samaria being taken captive to Media and the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] valley. The [[Kingdom of Judah]] continued as an independent state until it was conquered by a Babylonian army in the early 6th century BCE, destroying the [[First Temple]] that was at the center of ancient Jewish worship. The Judean elite was exiled to [[Babylonia]] and this is regarded as the first Jewish Diaspora. Later many of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of Babylonia by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] seventy years later, a period known as the [[Babylonian Captivity]]. A new [[Second Temple]] was constructed, and old religious practices were resumed.\n\nDuring the early years of the Second Temple, the highest religious authority was a council known as the Great Assembly, led by Ezra of the Book of Ezra. Among other accomplishments of the Great Assembly, the last books of the Bible were written at this time and the canon sealed.\n\n[[Hellenistic Judaism]] spread to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] from the 3rd century BCE. After [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|the Great Revolt]] (66\u201373 CE), the Romans destroyed the Temple. [[Hadrian]] built a pagan idol on the Temple grounds and prohibited circumcision; these acts of ethnocide provoked the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] 132\u2013136 CE after which the Romans banned the study of the [[Torah]] and the celebration of Jewish holidays, and forcibly removed virtually all Jews from Judea. In 200 CE, however, Jews were granted Roman citizenship and Judaism was recognized as a ''[[religio licita]]'' (\"legitimate religion\") until the rise of [[Gnosticism]] and [[Early Christianity]] in the fourth century.\n\nFollowing the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews, Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple, prayer took the place of sacrifice, and worship was rebuilt around the community (represented by a minimum of ten adult men) and the establishment of the authority of rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities (see [[Jewish diaspora]]).\n\n===Historical Jewish groupings (to 1700)===\n[[File:Parochet of Beth Jakov Macedonia.jpg|thumb|The [[Torah Ark]] of the Beth Jakov synagogue in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]]]\nAround the 1st century CE, there were several small Jewish sects: the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Zealots]], [[Essenes]], and [[early Christianity|Christians]]. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, these sects vanished.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sara E. Karesh|author2=Mitchell M.

The [[Sadducees]] rejected the [[Revelation|divine inspiration]] of the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]] and the [[Ketuvim|Writings]], relying only on the [[Torah]] as divinely inspired. Consequently, a number of other core tenets of the Pharisees' belief system (which became the basis for modern Judaism), were also dismissed by the Sadducees. (The [[Samaritans]] practiced a similar religion, which is traditionally considered separate from Judaism.)\n\nLike the Sadducees who relied only on the Torah, some Jews in the 8th and 9th centuries rejected the authority and divine inspiration of the [[oral law]] as recorded in the [[Mishnah]] (and developed by later rabbis in the two [[Talmud]]s), relying instead only upon the [[Tanakh]]. These included the Isunians, the Yudganites, the [[Malikites]], and others. They soon developed oral traditions of their own, which differed from the rabbinic traditions, and eventually formed the [[Karaism|Karaite]] sect. Karaites exist in small numbers today, mostly living in Israel. Rabbinical and Karaite Jews each hold that the others are Jews, but that the other faith is erroneous.\n\nOver a long time, Jews formed distinct ethnic groups in several different geographic areas\u2014amongst others, the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] (of [[Central Europe|central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]), the [[Sephardi Jews]] (of Spain, [[Portugal]], and [[North Africa]]), the [[Beta Israel]] of [[Ethiopia]], and the [[Yemenite Jews]] from the southern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Many of these groups have developed differences in their prayers, traditions and accepted canons; however, these distinctions are mainly the result of their being formed at some cultural distance from normative (rabbinic) Judaism, rather than based on any doctrinal dispute.\n\n===Persecutions===\n{{Main article|Persecution of Jews|Antisemitism|History of antisemitism}}\n[[Antisemitism]] arose during the [[Middle Ages]], in the form of persecutions, [[pogrom]]s, [[forced conversion]]s, expulsions, social restrictions and [[ghetto]]ization.\n\nThis was different in quality from the repressions of Jews which had occurred in ancient times. Ancient repressions were politically motivated and Jews were treated the same as members of other ethnic groups. With the rise of the Churches, the main motive for attacks on Jews changed from politics to religion and the religious motive for such attacks was specifically derived from Christian views about Jews and Judaism.<ref name=\"History, religion, and antisemitism\" /> During the [[Middle Ages]], Jewish people who lived under Muslim rule generally experienced tolerance and integration,<ref name=\"Cohen, Mark R 1991\">Cohen, Mark R. \"[https://www.academia.edu/6560487/Neo_lachrymose_Conception_of_Jewish-Arab_History The Neo-Lachrymose Conception of Jewish-Arab History].\" ''Tikkun'' 6.3 (1991)</ref> but there were occasional outbreaks of violence like [[Almohads#Status of non-Muslims|Almohad's persecutions]].<ref name=\"ugr\">Amira K.

It originated in a time of persecution of the Jewish people when European Jews had turned inward to Talmud study; many felt that most expressions of Jewish life had become too \"academic\", and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy. Its adherents favored small and informal gatherings called [[Shtiebel]], which, in contrast to a traditional synagogue, could be used both as a place of worship and for celebrations involving dancing, eating, and socializing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=How and Why Did Hasidism Spread?|last=Stampfer|first=Shaul|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel|pages=205\u2013207}}</ref> Ba'al Shem Tov's disciples attracted many followers; they themselves established numerous Hasidic sects across Europe. Unlike other religions, which typically expanded through word of mouth or by use of print, Hasidism spread largely owing to [[Tzadik]]s, who used their influence to encourage others to follow the movement. Hasidism appealed to many Europeans because it was easy to learn, did not require full immediate commitment, and presented a compelling spectacle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=How and Why Did Hasidism Spread?|last=Stampfer|first=Shaul|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel|pages=202\u2013204}}</ref> Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe. Waves of Jewish immigration in the 1880s carried it to the United States. The movement itself claims to be nothing new, but a ''refreshment'' of original Judaism. As some have put it: ''\"they merely re-emphasized that which the generations had lost\"''. Nevertheless, early on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as [[Misnagdim]], (lit. \"opponents\"). Some of the reasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the exuberance of Hasidic worship, its deviation from tradition in ascribing infallibility and miracles to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Over time differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of [[Haredi Judaism]].\n\n===The Enlightenment and new religious movements===\n{{Main article|Haskalah|Jewish religious movements}}\n\nIn the late 18th century CE, Europe was swept by a group of intellectual, social and political movements known as the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The Enlightenment led to reductions in the European laws that prohibited Jews to interact with the wider secular world, thus allowing Jews access to secular education and experience. A parallel Jewish movement, [[Haskalah]] or the \"Jewish Enlightenment\", began, especially in [[Central Europe]] and [[Western Europe]], in response to both the Enlightenment and these new freedoms. It placed an emphasis on integration with secular society and a pursuit of non-religious knowledge through reason. With the promise of political emancipation, many Jews saw no reason to continue to observe Jewish law and increasing numbers of Jews assimilated into Christian Europe. Modern religious movements of Judaism all formed in reaction to this trend.\n\nIn [[Central Europe]], followed by [[Great Britain]] and the United States, [[Reform Judaism|Reform (or Liberal) Judaism]] developed, relaxing legal obligations (especially those that limited Jewish relations with non-Jews), emulating [[Protestant]] decorum in prayer, and emphasizing the ethical values of Judaism's Prophetic tradition. [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] developed in reaction to Reform Judaism, by leaders who argued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to Christians while maintaining the observance of Jewish law. Meanwhile, in the United States, wealthy Reform Jews helped European scholars, who were Orthodox in practice but critical (and skeptical) in their study of the Bible and Talmud, to establish a seminary to train rabbis for immigrants from Eastern Europe. These left-wing Orthodox rabbis were joined by right-wing Reform rabbis who felt that Jewish law should not be entirely abandoned, to form the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative movement]]. Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah formed [[Haredi Orthodox Judaism]]. After massive movements of Jews following [[The Holocaust]] and the creation of [[Israel|the state of Israel]], these movements have competed for followers from among traditional Jews in or from other countries.\n\n===Spectrum of observance===\n[[File:KnesetEliyahooSynagogue.JPG|thumb|Judaism is practised in all parts of the world, for example in a synagogue in downtown [[Mumbai]].]]\nCountries such as the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Argentina]] and [[South Africa]] contain large Jewish populations. Jewish religious practice varies widely through all levels of observance. According to the 2001 edition of the [[National Jewish Population Survey]], in the United States' Jewish community\u2014the world's second largest\u20144.3&nbsp;million Jews out of 5.1&nbsp;million had some sort of connection to the religion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishdatabank.org/studies/details.cfm?StudyID=307 |title=National Jewish Population Survey (NJPS) 2000\u201301}}</ref> Of that population of connected Jews, 80% participated in some sort of Jewish religious observance, but only 48% belonged to a congregation, and fewer than 16% attend regularly.<ref name=\"harrisinteractive\" />\n\nBirth rates for American Jews have dropped from 2.0 to 1.7.<ref name=\"relations\" /> (Replacement rate is 2.1.) Intermarriage rates range from 40\u201350% in the US, and only about a third of children of intermarried couples are raised as Jews. Due to intermarriage and low birth rates, the Jewish population in the US shrank from 5.5&nbsp;million in 1990 to 5.1&nbsp;million in 2001. This is indicative of the general population trends among the Jewish community in the [[Diaspora]], but a focus on total population obscures growth trends in some denominations and communities, such as [[Haredi Judaism]]. The [[Baal teshuva]] movement is a movement of Jews who have \"returned\" to religion or become more observant.\n\n==Judaism and other religions==\n===Christianity and Judaism===\n{{Main article|Christianity and Judaism}}\n{{See also|Christianity and antisemitism|Christian\u2013Jewish reconciliation}}\n[[Christianity]] was originally a sect of [[Second Temple Judaism]], but the two religions [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|diverged in the first century]]. The differences between Christianity and Judaism originally centered on whether Jesus was the Jewish Messiah but eventually became irreconcilable. Major differences between the two faiths include the nature of the Messiah, of [[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]] and [[Jewish views on sin|sin]], the status of God's commandments to Israel, and perhaps most significantly of the [[God in Judaism|nature of God]] himself. Due to these differences, Judaism traditionally regards Christianity as [[Shituf]] or worship of the God of Israel which is not monotheistic. Christianity has traditionally regarded Judaism as obsolete with the invention of Christianity and Jews as a people replaced by the Church, though a Christian belief in [[dual-covenant theology]] emerged as a phenomenon following Christian reflection on how their theology influenced the Nazi [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].<ref>R.

They included provisions requiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing such as the [[Jewish hat]] and the [[yellow badge]], restricting Jews to certain cities and towns or in certain parts of towns ([[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghettos]]), and forbidding Jews to enter certain trades (for example selling new clothes in medieval [[Sweden]]). Disabilities also included special taxes levied on Jews, exclusion from public life, restraints on the performance of religious ceremonies, and linguistic censorship. Some countries went even further and completely expelled Jews, for example, [[Edict of Expulsion|England]] in 1290 (Jews were readmitted in 1655) and [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|Spain]] in 1492 (readmitted in 1868). The first Jewish settlers in North America arrived in the Dutch colony of [[New Amsterdam]] in 1654; they were forbidden to hold public office, open a retail shop, or establish a synagogue. When the colony was seized by the British in 1664 Jewish rights remained unchanged, but by 1671 [[Asser Levy]] was the first Jew to serve on a jury in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/amsterdam.html |title=New Amsterdam's Jewish Crusader |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}</ref>\nIn 1791, [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] was the first country to abolish disabilities altogether, followed by [[Prussia]] in 1848. [[Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom]] was achieved in 1858 after an almost 30-year struggle championed by [[Isaac Lyon Goldsmid]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/237923/Sir-Isaac-Lyon-Goldsmid-1st-Baronet#ref213807 |title=Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, 1st Baronet| publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]}}</ref> with the ability of Jews to sit in parliament with the passing of the [[Jews Relief Act 1858]]. The newly united [[German Empire]] in 1871 abolished Jewish disabilities in Germany, which were reinstated in the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935.\n\nJewish life in Christian lands was marked by frequent [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[massacre]]s. An underlying source of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. Christian rhetoric and antipathy towards Jews developed in the [[Apostolic Age|early years of Christianity]] and was reinforced by ever increasing anti-Jewish measures over the [[Early Christianity|ensuing centuries]]. The action taken by Christians against Jews included acts of violence, and murder culminating in the [[Holocaust]].<ref name=\"HarriesAfter\" />{{rp|21}}<ref name=\"Kung\" />{{rp|169}}<ref name=\"Dawidowicz\" /> These attitudes were reinforced in Christian preaching, art and popular teaching for two millennia, containing contempt for Jews,<ref name=JCPSHorst>Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. 5 May 2009.

Much of their work has one unrecognized, but two who will never forget them are Max Krakauer and his wife. Sheltered in sixty-six houses and helped by more than eighty individuals who belonged to the Confessing Church, they owe them their lives. German Catholic churches went out of their way to protect Catholics of Jewish ancestry. More inclusive was the principled stand taken by Catholic Bishop Clemens Count von Galen of Munster.

In both Jewish and [[Muslim]] tradition, the Jewish and [[Arabs|Arab peoples]] are descended from the two sons of Abraham\u2014[[Isaac]] and [[Ishmael]], respectively. While both religions are [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] and share many commonalities, they differ based on the fact that Jews do not consider [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] or [[Muhammad]] to be prophets. The religions' adherents have interacted with each other since the 7th century when [[Islam]] originated and spread in the [[Arabian peninsula]]. Indeed, the years 712 to 1066 CE under the [[Ummayad]] and the [[Abbasid]] rulers have been called the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]]. Non-Muslim monotheists living in these countries, including Jews, were known as [[dhimmis]]. Dhimmis were allowed to practice their own religions and administer their own internal affairs, but they were subject to certain restrictions that were not imposed on Muslims.<ref name=\"Lewis-84\" /> For example, they had to pay the [[jizya]], a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males,<ref name=\"Lewis-84\" /> and they were also forbidden to bear arms or testify in court cases involving Muslims.<ref name=\"lewis14\" /> Many of the laws regarding dhimmis were highly symbolic.

This universal humanity, however, was predicated (and still is) on the dualism of the flesh and the spirit, such that while the body is particular, marked through practice as Jew or Greek, and through anatomy as male or female, the spirit is universal. Paul did not, however, reject the body\u2014as did, for instance, the gnostics\u2014but rather promoted a system whereby the body had its place, albeit subordinated to the spirit. Paul's anthropological dualism was matched by a hermeneutical dualism as well. Just as the human being is divided into a fleshy and a spiritual component, so also is language itself. It is composed of outer, material signs and inner, spiritual significations. When this is applied to the religious system that Paul inherited, the physical, fleshy signs of the Torah, of historical Judaism, are re-interpreted as symbols of that which Paul takes to be universal requirements and possibilities for humanity. }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"A radical Jew: Paul and the politics of identity10\">{{cite book |last = Boyarin |first = Daniel |title = A radical Jew: Paul and the politics of identity |year= 1994 |publisher = University of California Press |location = Berkeley, California |isbn = 0-520-08592-2 |chapter = Answering the Mail |chapterurl = http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft7w10086w&chunk.id=ch10&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ch10&brand=ucpress |quote = Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension with one another. }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Britannica Online Encyclopedia: Bet Din\">{{cite web|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/63134/bet-din |title=Britannica Online Encyclopedia: Bet Din |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Conservative Judaism\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jewlicious.com/2005/06/conservative-judaism/ |title=Conservative Judaism |publisher=Jewlicious |quote=We therefore understand this term as a metaphor to mean that the Torah is divine and that it reflects God's will.}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Ethnoreligious\">See, for example, [[Deborah Dash Moore]], ''American Jewish Identity Politics'', [[University of Michigan Press]], 2008, p.&nbsp;303; Ewa Morawska, ''Insecure Prosperity: Small-Town Jews in Industrial America, 1890\u20131940'', [[Princeton University Press]], 1999. p.&nbsp;217; Peter Y.

The rise of Messianic Judaism was, in many ways, a logical outcome of the ideology and rhetoric of the movement to evangelize the Jews as well as its early sponsorship of various forms of Hebrew Christian expressions. The missions have promoted the message that Jews who had embraced Christianity were not betraying their heritage or even their faith but were actually fulfilling their true Jewish selves by becoming Christians. The missions also promoted the dispensationalist idea that the Church equals the body of the true Christian believers and that Christians were defined by their acceptance of Jesus as their personal Savior and not by their affiliations with specific denominations and particular liturgies or modes of prayer. Missions had been using Jewish symbols in their buildings and literature and called their centers by Hebrew names such as Emanuel or Beth Sar Shalom. Similarly, the missions' publications featured Jewish religious symbols and practices such as the lighting of a menorah. Although missionaries to the Jews were alarmed when they first confronted the more assertive and independent movement of Messianic Judaism, it was they who were responsible for its conception and indirectly for its birth. The ideology, rhetoric, and symbols they had promoted for generations provided the background for the rise of a new movement that missionaries at first rejected as going too far but later accepted and even embraced.\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Ariel2006p191a\">{{cite book\n|last = Ariel\n|first = Yaakov<!--''not'' the Yaakov Ariel with a Wikipedia entry-->\n|editor1-last=Gallagher\n|editor1-first=Eugene V.\n|editor2-last=Ashcraft\n|editor2-first=W.

Missionaries such as the Southern Baptist Robert Lindsey noted that for Israeli Jews, the term ''nozrim'', \"Christians\" in Hebrew, meant, almost automatically, an alien, hostile religion. Because such a term made it nearly impossible to convince Jews that Christianity was their religion, missionaries sought a more neutral term, one that did not arouse negative feelings. They chose ''Meshichyim'', Messianic, to overcome the suspicion and antagonism of the term ''nozrim''. ''Meshichyim'' as a term also had the advantage of emphasizing messianism as a major component of the Christian evangelical belief that the missions and communities of Jewish converts to Christianity propagated. It conveyed the sense of a new, innovative religion rather that''{{sic}}'' an old, unfavorable one. The term was used in reference to those Jews who accepted Jesus as their personal savior, and did not apply to Jews accepting Roman Catholicism who in Israel have called themselves Hebrew Christians. The term Messianic Judaism was adopted in the United States in the early 1970s by those converts to evangelical Christianity who advocated a more assertive attitude on the part of converts towards their Jewish roots and heritage.\n|lccn = 2006022954}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Denominations\">\n;[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]\n:{{cite web\n |url=http://www.aish.com/jw/s/48892792.html \n |title=Why Jews Don't Believe in Jesus \n |accessdate=28 July 2010 \n |last=Simmons \n |first=Shraga \n |publisher=[[Aish HaTorah]] \n |quote=Jews do not accept Jesus as the messiah because:<br />#Jesus did not fulfill the messianic prophecies. #Jesus did not embody the personal qualifications of the Messiah. #Biblical verses \"referring\" to Jesus are mistranslations. #Jewish belief is based on national revelation. \n}}\n;[[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]:{{cite web\n |url=http://www.uscj.org/Messianic_Jews_Not_J5480.html \n |title=Messianic Jews Are Not Jews \n |accessdate=14 February 2007 \n |last=Waxman \n |first=Jonathan \n |year=2006 \n |publisher=[[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]] \n |quote=Hebrew Christian, Jewish Christian, Jew for Jesus, Messianic Jew, Fulfilled Jew.

Circumcision is not an absolute requirement of being a Covenant member (that is, being made righteous before HaShem, and thus obtaining eternal life), but it is a requirement of obedience to God's commandments, because circumcision is commanded for those who are of the seed of Abraham, whether born into the family, adopted, or converted....If after reading all of this you understand what circumcision is, and that is an act of obedience, rather than an act of gaining favor before HaShem for the purpose of receiving eternal life, then if you are male believer in Yeshua the Messiah for the redemption from death, the consequence of your sin of rebellion against Him, then pursue circumcision, and thus conversion into Judaism, as an act of obedience to the Messiah.\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Meltonp373a\">[[J.

John Stuart was educated by his father, with the advice and assistance of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Francis Place]]. He was given an extremely rigorous upbringing, and was deliberately shielded from association with children his own age other than his siblings. His father, a follower of Bentham and an adherent of [[associationism]], had as his explicit aim to create a [[genius]] intellect that would carry on the cause of [[utilitarianism]] and its implementation after he and Bentham had died.<ref>{{cite book |last=Halevy |first=Elie |title=The Growth of Philosophic Radicalism |year=1966 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0191010200 |pages=282\u2013284}}</ref>\n\nMill was a notably precocious child. He describes his education in his autobiography.

His main reading was still history, but he went through all the commonly taught [[Latin literature|Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek]] authors and by the age of ten could read Plato and [[Demosthenes]] with ease. His father also thought that it was important for Mill to study and compose poetry. One of Mill's earliest poetic compositions was a continuation of the [[Iliad]]. In his spare time he also enjoyed reading about [[natural science]]s and popular novels, such as ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''.\n\nHis father's work, ''[[The History of British India]]'' was published in 1818; immediately thereafter, at about the age of twelve, Mill began a thorough study of the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[logic]], at the same time reading [[Aristotle]]'s logical treatises in the original language. In the following year he was introduced to [[political economy]] and studied [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]] with his father, ultimately completing their [[Classical economics|classical economic view]] of [[factors of production]]. Mill's ''comptes rendus'' of his daily economy lessons helped his father in writing ''Elements of Political Economy'' in 1821, a textbook to promote the ideas of [[Ricardian economics]]; however, the book lacked popular support.<ref name=\"Rothbard2006\">{{cite book |author=Murray N.

The mountain scenery he saw led to a lifelong taste for mountain landscapes. The lively and friendly way of life of the French also left a deep impression on him. In [[Montpellier]], he attended the winter courses on [[chemistry]], [[zoology]], [[logic]] of the ''Facult\u00e9 des Sciences'', as well as taking a course in higher mathematics. While coming and going from France, he stayed in Paris for a few days in the house of the renowned economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], a friend of Mill's father. There he met many leaders of the Liberal party, as well as other notable Parisians, including [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri Saint-Simon]].\n\nMill went through months of sadness and pondered suicide at twenty years of age. According to the opening paragraphs of Chapter V of his autobiography, he had asked himself whether the creation of a just society, his life's objective, would actually make him happy. His heart answered \"no\", and unsurprisingly he lost the happiness of striving towards this objective. Eventually, the poetry of [[William Wordsworth]] showed him that beauty generates compassion for others and stimulates joy.[http://www.victorianweb.org/philosophy/mill/crisis.html] With renewed joy he continued to work towards a just society, but with more relish for the journey. He considered this one of the most pivotal shifts in his thinking. In fact, many of the differences between him and his father stemmed from this expanded source of joy.\n\nMill had been engaged in a pen-friendship with [[Auguste Comte]], the founder of [[positivism]] and sociology, since Mill first contacted Comte in November 1841. Comte's ''sociologie'' was more an early [[philosophy of science]] than we perhaps know it today, and the ''positive'' philosophy aided in Mill's broad rejection of Benthamism.<ref>Pickering, Mary (1993), ''Auguste Comte: an intellectual biography'', Cambridge University Press, p. 540</ref>\n\nAs a [[nonconformist]] who refused to subscribe to the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]], Mill was not eligible to study at the [[University of Oxford]] or the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name=\"bio\">Capaldi, Nicholas.

Taylor was married when they met, and their relationship was close but generally believed to be chaste during the years before her first husband died. Brilliant in her own right, Taylor was a significant influence on Mill's work and ideas during both friendship and marriage. His relationship with Harriet Taylor reinforced Mill's advocacy of [[women's rights]]. He cites her influence in his final revision of ''[[On Liberty]]'', which was published shortly after her death. Taylor died in 1858 after developing severe [[lung congestion]], after only seven years of marriage to Mill.\n\nBetween the years 1865 and 1868 Mill served as [[Lord Rector]] of the [[University of St. Andrews]].

During his time as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]], Mill advocated easing the burdens on Ireland. In 1866, Mill became the first person in the history of Parliament to call for women to be given the right to vote, vigorously defending this position in subsequent debate. Mill became a strong advocate of such social reforms as labour unions and farm cooperatives. In ''[[Considerations on Representative Government]]'', Mill called for various reforms of Parliament and voting, especially [[proportional representation]], the [[single transferable vote]], and the extension of [[suffrage]]. In April 1868, Mill favoured in a Commons debate the retention of [[capital punishment]] for such crimes as aggravated murder; he termed its abolition \"an effeminacy in the general mind of the country.\"<ref name=\":2\">John Stuart Mill: ''Utilitarianism and the 1868 Speech on Capital Punishment''.

[[William Whewell]] expanded on this in his 1837 ''History of the Inductive Sciences, from the Earliest to the Present Time'' followed in 1840 by ''The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, Founded Upon their History'', presenting induction as the mind superimposing concepts on facts. Laws were self-evident truths, which could be known without need for empirical verification. Mill countered this in 1843 in ''[[A System of Logic]], Ratiocinative and Inductive, Being a Connected View of the Principles of Evidence, and the Methods of Scientific Investigation.'' In [[Mill's Methods]] of induction, like Herschel's, laws were discovered through observation and induction, and required empirical verification.<ref name=\"Shermer2002\">{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Shermer |authorlink=Michael Shermer |title=In Darwin's Shadow: The Life and Science of Alfred Russel Wallace: A Biographical Study on the Psychology of History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eu9Uu3PbdcgC&pg=PP212 |date=15 August 2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199923854 |page=212}}</ref>\n\n===Theory of liberty===\n{{Liberalism sidebar}}\n{{Main|On Liberty}}\nMill's ''[[On Liberty]]'' addresses the nature and limits of the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] that can be legitimately exercised by society over the [[individual]]. However Mill is clear that his concern for liberty does not extend to all individuals and all societies. He states that \"Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34901|title=On Liberty by John Stuart Mill|publisher=|via=www.gutenberg.org}}</ref>\n\nMill states that it is acceptable to harm oneself as long as the person doing so is not harming others. He also argues that individuals should be prevented from doing lasting, serious harm to themselves or their property by the [[harm principle]]. Because no one exists in isolation, harm done to oneself may also harm others, and destroying property deprives the community as well as oneself.<ref>Mill, John Stuart \"On Liberty\" Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0141441474}} pp. 90\u201391</ref> Mill excuses those who are \"incapable of [[self-government]]\" from this principle, such as young children or those living in \"backward states of society\".\n\nThough this principle seems clear, there are a number of complications. For example, Mill explicitly states that \"harms\" may include acts of omission as well as acts of commission. Thus, failing to rescue a [[drowning]] child counts as a harmful act, as does failing to pay [[taxes]], or failing to appear as a [[witness]] in court. All such harmful omissions may be regulated, according to Mill. By contrast, it does not count as harming someone if \u2013 without force or fraud \u2013 the affected individual consents to assume the risk: thus one may permissibly offer unsafe employment to others, provided there is no deception involved. (Mill does, however, recognise one limit to consent: society should not permit people to [[Voluntary slavery|sell themselves into slavery]]). In these and other cases, it is important to bear in mind that the arguments in ''On Liberty'' are grounded on the principle of Utility, and not on appeals to [[natural rights]].\n\nThe question of what counts as a self-regarding action and what actions, whether of omission or commission, constitute harmful actions subject to regulation, continues to exercise interpreters of Mill. It is important to emphasise that Mill did not consider giving offence to constitute \"harm\"; an action could not be restricted because it violated the conventions or morals of a given society.\n\n''[[On Liberty]]'' involves an impassioned defense of free speech. Mill argues that free [[discourse]] is a [[necessary condition]] for intellectual and social progress. We can never be sure, he contends, that a silenced opinion does not contain some element of the truth. He also argues that allowing people to air false opinions is productive for two reasons. First, individuals are more likely to abandon erroneous beliefs if they are engaged in an open exchange of ideas. Second, by forcing other individuals to re-examine and re-affirm their beliefs in the process of debate, these beliefs are kept from declining into mere [[dogma]]. It is not enough for Mill that one simply has an unexamined belief that happens to be true; one must understand why the belief in question is the true one. Along those same lines Mill wrote, \"unmeasured vituperation, employed on the side of prevailing opinion, really does deter people from expressing contrary opinions, and from listening to those who express them.\"<ref>Mill, John Stuart, ''On Liberty'', Harvard Classics: Volume 25, p. 258, PF Collier & Sons Company New York 1909</ref>\n[[File:J S Mill and H Taylor.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|John Stuart Mill and [[Helen Taylor (feminist)|Helen Taylor]].

Introductory. Mill, John Stuart. 1869. On Liberty|website=www.bartleby.com|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref> For him, liberty in antiquity was a \"contest\u2026 between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the government.\"<ref name=\"OnLiberty-Bartleby\" /> Mill defined \"[[social liberty]]\" as protection from \"the tyranny of political rulers\". He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny, and [[tyranny of the majority]].\n\n[[Social liberty]] for Mill meant putting limits on the ruler's power so that he would not be able to use his power on his own wishes and make decisions which could harm society; in other words, people should have the right to have a say in the government's decisions. He said that [[social liberty]] was \"the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual\". It was attempted in two ways: first, by obtaining recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights; second, by establishment of a system of \"[[constitutional]] checks\".\n\nHowever, in Mill's view, limiting the power of government was not enough. He stated, \"Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practices a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself.\"<ref>Mill, John Stuart, \"On Liberty\" Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0141441474}} pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\n====Liberty====\nJohn Stuart Mill's view on [[liberty]], which was influenced by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Josiah Warren]], is that the [[individual]] ought to be free to do as she/he wishes unless she/he harms others. Individuals are rational enough to make decisions about their well being. Government should interfere when it is for the protection of society. Mill explained:\n\n<blockquote>The sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right...The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns him, his independence is, of right, [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]]. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the [[individual]] is [[sovereignty|sovereign]].<ref>Mill, ''On Liberty'', p. 13.

He says:\n\n<blockquote>I choose, by preference the cases which are least favourable to me \u2013 In which the argument opposing freedom of opinion, both on truth and that of [[utility]], is considered the strongest. Let the opinions impugned be the belief of God and in a future state, or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality... But I must be permitted to observe that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of [[infallibility]]. It is the undertaking to decide that question ''for others'', without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less if it is put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions. However, positive anyone's persuasion may be, not only of the faculty but of the pernicious consequences, but (to adopt expressions which I altogether condemn) the immorality and impiety of opinion. \u2013 yet if, in pursuance of that private judgement, though backed by the public judgement of his country or contemporaries, he prevents the opinion from being heard in its defence, he assumes infallibility. And so far from the assumption being less objectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is called immoral or impious, this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal.<ref>John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873) \"On Liberty\" 1859. ed. Gertrude Himmelfarb, UK: Penguin, 1985, pp. 83\u201384</ref></blockquote>\n\nMill outlines the benefits of 'searching for and discovering the truth' as a way to further knowledge. He argued that even if an opinion is false, the truth can be better understood by refuting the error. And as most opinions are neither completely true nor completely false, he points out that allowing free expression allows the airing of competing views as a way to preserve partial truth in various opinions.<ref name=\"Freedomof\">Freedom of Speech, Volume 21, by Ellen Frankel Paul, Fred Dycus Miller, Jeffrey Paul</ref> Worried about minority views being suppressed, Mill also argued in support of freedom of speech on political grounds, stating that it is a critical component for a representative government to have in order to empower debate over public policy.<ref name=\"Freedomof\" /> Mill also eloquently argued that freedom of expression allows for personal growth and self-realization. He said that freedom of speech was a vital way to develop talents and realise a person's potential and creativity. He repeatedly said that [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] was preferable to uniformity and stagnation.<ref name=\"Freedomof\" />\n\n====Harm principle====\nThe belief that the freedom of speech will advance the society was formed with trust of the public's ability to filter. If any argument is really wrong or harmful, the public will judge it as wrong or harmful, and then those arguments cannot be sustained and will be excluded. Mill argued that even any arguments which are used in justifying murder or rebellion against the government shouldn't be politically suppressed or socially persecuted. According to him, if rebellion is really necessary, people should rebel; if murder is truly proper, it should be allowed. But, the way to express those arguments should be a public speech or writing, not in a way that causes actual harm to others. This is the harm principle.\n\n<blockquote> That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.<ref>John Stuart Mill. (1863 [1859]). ''On Liberty''. Ticknor and Fields. p. 23</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. made the standard of \"clear and present danger\" based on Mill's idea. In the majority opinion, Holmes writes:\n\n<blockquote> The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.<ref>''Schenck v. United States'', 249 US 47 \u2013 Supreme Court 1919</ref></blockquote>\n\nHolmes suggested that shouting out \"Fire!\" in a dark theatre, which makes people panic and gets them injured, would be such a case of speech that creates an illegal danger.{{sfn|George|Kline|2006|p=409}} But if the situation allows people to reason by themselves and decide to accept it or not, any argument or theology should not be blocked.\n\nNowadays, Mill's argument is generally accepted by many democratic countries, and they have laws at least guided by the harm principle. For example, in American law some exceptions limit free speech such as obscenity, defamation, breach of peace, and \"fighting words\".{{sfn|George|Kline|2006|p=410}}\n\n===Colonialism===\n\nMill, an employee for the [[British East India Company]] from 1823 to 1858,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/philosophy/mill/career.html|title=J.

Yet not only was there a greater strength of sentiment against it, but, in England at least, a less amount either of feeling or of interest in favour of it, than of any other of the customary abuses of force: for its motive was the love of gain, unmixed and undisguised: and those who profited by it were a very small numerical fraction of the country, while the natural feeling of all who were not personally interested in it, was unmitigated abhorrence.<ref name=\"The Subjection of Women\">Mill, J.

He countered arguments to the contrary, arguing that relations between sexes simply amounted to \"the legal subordination of one sex to the other \u2013 [which] is wrong itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement; and that it ought to be replaced by a principle of perfect equality.\" With this, Mill can be considered among the earliest male proponents of gender equality.

S. Mill|oclc=907652431}}</ref>\n\n===Utilitarianism===\n{{Main|Utilitarianism (book)}}\nThe canonical statement of Mill's utilitarianism can be found in ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]''. This philosophy has a long tradition, although Mill's account is primarily influenced by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and Mill's father [[James Mill]].\n\nJeremy Bentham's famous formulation of utilitarianism is known as the \"greatest-happiness principle\". It holds that one must always act so as to produce the greatest aggregate happiness among all sentient beings, within reason. In a similar vein, Mill's method of determining the best utility is that a moral agent, when given the choice between two or more actions, ought to choose the action that contributes most to (maximizes) the total happiness in the world. Happiness in this context is understood as the production of pleasure or privation of pain. Given that determining the action that produces the most utility is not always so clear cut, Mill suggests that the utilitarian moral agent, when attempting to rank the utility of different actions, should refer to the general experience of persons. That is, if people generally experience more happiness following action X than they do action Y, the utilitarian should conclude that action X produces more utility than, and is thus favorable to, action Y.<ref name=\"John Stuart Mill\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11224|title=Utilitarianism by John Stuart Mill|publisher=|via=www.gutenberg.org}}</ref>\n\nUtilitarianism is built upon the basis of consequentialism, that is, the means are justified based solely off the result of said actions. The overarching goal of Utilitarianism \u2013 the ideal consequence \u2013 is to achieve the \u201cgreatest good for the greatest number as the end result of human action\u201d.<ref>Freeman, Stephen J., Dennis W. Engels, and Michael K. Altekruse. \"Foundations for Ethical Standards and Codes: The Role of Moral Philosophy and Theory in Ethics.\" ''Counseling and Values'', vol. 48, no. 3, 2004, pp. 163\u2013173'', eLibrary''.</ref> Mill states in his writings on Utilitarianism that \u201chappiness is the sole end of human action.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> This statement brought about a bit of controversy, which is why Mill took it a step further, explaining how the very nature of humans wanting happiness, and who \u201ctake it to be reasonable under free consideration\u201d, demands that happiness is indeed desirable.<ref name=\":1\" /> In other words, free will leads everyone to make actions inclined on their own happiness, unless reasoned that it would improve the happiness of others, in which case, the greatest utility is still being achieved. To that extent, the Utilitarianism that Mill is describing is a default lifestyle that he believes is what people who have not studied a specific opposing field of ethics would naturally and subconsciously utilize when faced with decision. Utilitarianism is thought of by some of its activists to be a more developed and overarching ethical theory of Kant's belief in good will however, and not just some default cognitive process of humans. Where Kant would argue that reason can only be used properly by good will, Mill would say that the only way to universally create fair laws and systems would be to step back to the consequences, whereby Kant's ethical theories become based around the ultimate good \u2013 utility.<ref>Davis, G. Scott. \"Introduction.\" Introduction to Utilitarianism, by John Stuart Mill, VII\u2013XIV. Barnes & Noble Library of Essential Reading. Barnes and Noble, 2005.</ref> By this logic the only valid way to discern what is proper reason would be to view the consequences of any action and weigh the good and the bad, even if on the surface, the ethical reasoning seems to indicate a different train of thought.\n\nMill's major contribution to utilitarianism is his argument for the qualitative separation of pleasures. Bentham treats all forms of happiness as equal, whereas Mill argues that intellectual and moral pleasures (higher pleasures) are superior to more physical forms of pleasure (lower pleasures). Mill distinguishes between happiness and contentment, claiming that the former is of higher value than the latter, a belief wittily encapsulated in the statement that \"it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be [[Socrates]] dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question.\"<ref name=\"John Stuart Mill\"/>\n\nMill defines the difference between higher and lower forms of pleasure with the principle that those who have experienced both tend to prefer one over the other. This is, perhaps, in direct contrast with Bentham's statement that \"Quantity of pleasure being equal, push-pin is as good as poetry\",<ref name=\"Bronfenbrenner\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.1977.tb00452.x | volume=15 | title=Poetry, Pushpin, and Utility | year=1977 | journal=Economic Inquiry | pages=95\u2013110 | last1 = Bronfenbrenner | first1 = Martin}}</ref> that, if a simple child's game like [[hopscotch]] causes more pleasure to more people than a night at the opera house, it is more imperative upon a society to devote more resources to propagating hopscotch than running opera houses. Mill's argument is that the \"simple pleasures\" tend to be preferred by people who have no experience with high art, and are therefore not in a proper position to [[Informed judge|judge]]. Mill also argues that people who, for example, are noble or practice philosophy, benefit society more than those who engage in individualist practices for pleasure, which are lower forms of happiness. It is not the agent's own greatest happiness that matters \"but the greatest amount of happiness altogether\".{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=[https://archive.org/stream/a592840000milluoft#page/16 16]}}\n\nMill separated his explanation of Utilitarianism into five different sections; General Remarks, What Utilitarianism Is, Of the Ultimate Sanction of the Principle of Utility, Of What Sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible, and Of the Connection between Justice and Utility. In the General Remarks portion of his essay he speaks how next to no progress has been made when it comes to judging what is right and what is wrong of morality and if there is such a thing as moral instinct (which he argues that there may not be). However he agrees that in general \"Our moral faculty, according to all those of its interpreters who are entitled to the name of thinkers, supplies us only with the general principles of moral judgments\".{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=2}} In the second chapter of his essay he focuses no longer on background information but Utilitarianism itself. He quotes Utilitarianism as \"The greatest happiness principle\" And defines this theory by saying that pleasure and no pain are the only inherently good things in the world and expands on it by saying that \"actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure.\"{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=3}} He views it not as an animalistic concept because he sees seeking out pleasure as a way of using our higher facilities. He also says in this chapter that the happiness principle is based not exclusively on the individual but mainly on the community.\n\nIn his next chapter he focuses in more on the specifics of Utilitarianism when he writes about the sanctions of oneself. He states that a person possesses two sanctions; the internal sanction and the external sanction. According to Mill, the internal sanction is \"a feeling in our own mind; a pain, more or less intense, attendant on violation of duty, which in properly cultivated moral natures rises, in the more serious cases, into shrinking from it as an impossibility.\"{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=6}} Shorthand, he basically just explains that your internal sanction is your conscience. The external sanction he says is \"the hope of favour and the fear of displeasure, from our fellow creatures or from the Ruler of the Universe\". This states that the external sanction is almost a form of fear of God himself. The sanctions are mentioned because according to Mill the internal sanction is what grasps onto the concept of Utilitarianism and is what make people want to accept Utilitarianism.\n\nIn Mill's fourth chapter he speaks of what proofs of Utility are affected. He starts this chapter off by saying that all of his claims cannot be backed up by reasoning. He claims that the only proof that something is brings one pleasure is if someone finds it pleasurable. Next he talks about how morality is the basic way to achieve happiness. He also discusses in this chapter that Utilitarianism is beneficial for virtue. He says that \"it maintains not only that virtue is to be desired, but that it is to be desired disinterestedly, for itself.\"{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=24}} In his final chapter Mill looks and the connection between Utilitarianism and justice. He contemplates the question of whether justice is something distinct from Utility or not. He reasons this question in several different ways and finally comes to the conclusion that in certain cases justice is essential for Utility, but in others social duty is far more important than justice. Mill believes that \"justice must give way to some other moral principle, but that what is just in ordinary cases is, by reason of that other principle, not just in the particular case.\"{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=29}}\n\nThe qualitative account of happiness that Mill advocates thus sheds light on his account presented in ''On Liberty''. As Mill suggests in that text, utility is to be conceived in relation to humanity \"as a progressive being\", which includes the development and exercise of rational capacities as we strive to achieve a \"higher mode of existence\". The rejection of censorship and [[paternalism]] is intended to provide the necessary social conditions for the achievement of knowledge and the greatest ability for the greatest number to develop and exercise their deliberative and rational capacities.\n\nMill redefines the definition of happiness as; \"the ultimate end, for the sake of which all other things are desirable (whether we are considering our own good or that of other people) is an existence as free as possible from pain and as rich as possible in enjoyments\".{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=8}} He firmly believed that moral rules and obligations could be referenced to promoting happiness, which connects to having a noble character. While John Stuart Mill is not a standard act or rule utilitarian, he is a minimizing utilitarian, which \"affirms that it would be ''desirable'' to maximize happiness for the greatest number, but not that we are not morally ''required'' to do so\".{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2006|p=84}}\n\nMill's thesis distinguishes between higher and lower pleasures. He frequently discusses the importance of acknowledgement of higher pleasures. \"To suppose that life has (as they express it) no higher end than pleasure- no better and nobler object of desire and pursuit they designate as utterly mean and groveling; as a doctrine worthy only of swine\".{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}} When he says higher pleasures, he means the pleasures that access higher abilities and capacities in humans such as intellectual prosperity, whereas lower pleasures would mean bodily or temporary pleasures. \"But it must be admitted that when utilitarian writers have said that mental pleasures are better than bodily ones they have mainly based this on mental pleasures being more permanent, safer, less costly and so on&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. from their circumstantial advantages rather than from their intrinsic nature\".{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=6}} All of this factors into John Mill's own definition of utilitarianism, and shows why it differs from other definitions.\n\n===Economic philosophy===\n{{Main|Principles of Political Economy}}\n[[File:Mill - Essays on economics and society, 1967 - 5499347.tif|thumb|''Essays on economics and society'', 1967]]\nMill's early [[Philosophy and economics|economic philosophy]] was one of [[free market]]s. However, he accepted interventions in the economy, such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient [[utilitarian]] grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare.<ref>[http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/dfiles/file_285.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626225342/http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/dfiles/file_285.pdf|date=26 June 2008}}</ref>  Mill originally believed that \"equality of taxation\" meant \"[[equality of sacrifice]]\" and that [[progressive tax]]ation penalised those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore \"a mild form of robbery\".<ref>[http://www.irefeurope.org/col_docs/doc_51_fr.pdf IREF | Pour la liberte economique et la concurrence fiscale] (PDF) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327011315/http://www.irefeurope.org/col_docs/doc_51_fr.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nGiven an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that [[inheritance]] should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes&nbsp;\u2013 some charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.{{sfn|Strasser|1991}}\n\nLater he altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his Principles of Political Economy in defence of a socialist outlook, and defending some socialist causes.<ref>{{cite book |author=Mill, John Stuart and Bentham, Jeremy edited by Ryan, Alan. |title=Utilitarianism and other essays |edition= |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2004 |location=London |isbn=978-0140432725 |page=11}}</ref> Within this revised work he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system.

In the case of [[Oxford University]] it was the standard text until 1919, when it was replaced by [[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Marshall's ''Principles of Economics'']].\n\n====Economic democracy====\nMill promoted [[economic democracy]] instead of [[capitalism]], in the manner of substituting capitalist businesses with [[worker cooperative]]s. He says:\n\n<blockquote>The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.<ref>Principles of Political Economy with some of their Applications to Social Philosophy, IV.7.21 John Stuart Mill: Political Economy, IV.7.21</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Political democracy====\nMill's major work on political democracy, ''Considerations on Representative Government'', defends two fundamental principles: extensive participation by citizens and enlightened competence of rulers.<ref>Thompson, Dennis. ''John Stuart Mill and Representative Government''. Princeton University Press, 1976. {{ISBN|978-0691021874}}</ref> The two values are obviously in tension, and some readers have concluded that he is an elitist democrat,<ref>Letwin, Shirley.

''Participation and Democratic Theory''. Cambridge University Press, 1970 (p. 28). {{ISBN|978-0521290043}}</ref> In one section he appears to defend plural voting, in which more competent citizens are given extra votes (a view he later repudiated). But in chapter 3 he presents what is still one of the most eloquent cases for the value of participation by all citizens. He believed that the incompetence of the masses could eventually be overcome if they were given a chance to take part in politics, especially at the local level.\n\nMill is one of the few political philosophers ever to serve in government as an elected official. In his three years in Parliament, he was more willing to compromise than the \"radical\" principles expressed in his writing would lead one to expect.<ref>Thompson, Dennis. \"Mill in Parliament: When Should a Philosopher Compromise?\" in ''J. S. Mill's Political Thought'', eds. N. Urbinati and A.

He concluded that a [[Steady-state economy|stationary state]] could be preferable to unending economic growth:\n\n<blockquote>I cannot, therefore, regard the stationary states of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested towards it by political economists of the old school.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>If the earth must lose that great portion of its pleasantness which it owes to things that the unlimited increase of wealth and population would extirpate from it, for the mere purpose of enabling it to support a larger, but not a better or a happier population, I sincerely hope, for the sake of posterity, that they will be content to be stationary, long before necessity compel them to it.</blockquote>\n\n====Economic development====\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}\nMill regarded economic development as a function of land, labour and capital. While land and labour are the two original factors of production, capital is \"a stock, previously accumulated of the products of former labour.\" Increase in wealth is possible only if land and capital help to increase production faster than the labour force. It is productive labour that is productive of wealth and capital accumulation. \"The rate of capital accumulation is the function of the proportion of the labour force employed productively. Profits earned by employing unproductive labours are merely transfers of income; unproductive labour does not generate wealth or income\". It is productive labourers who do productive consumption. Productive consumption is that \"which maintains and increase the productive capacity of the community.\" It implies that productive consumption is an input necessary to maintain productive labourers.<ref>''John Stuart Mill's Social and Political Thought: Critical Assessments'', by John Stuart Mill</ref>\n\n====Control of population growth====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\nMill supported the [[Malthusian]] theory of population. By population he meant the number of the working class only. He was therefore concerned about the growth in number of labourers who worked for hire. He believed that population control was essential for improving the condition of the working class so that they might enjoy the fruits of the technological progress and capital accumulation. Mill advocated birth control. In 1823 Mill and a friend were arrested while distributing pamphlets on birth control by Francis Place to women in working class areas.<ref name=\"Capaldi2004\">{{cite book |author=Nicholas Capaldi |title=John Stuart Mill: A Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SxydLpuVC4C |accessdate=1 September 2013 |year= 2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1139449205 |page=41}}</ref>\n\n====Wage fund====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\nAccording to Mill, supply is very elastic in response to wages. Wages generally exceed the minimum subsistence level, and are paid out of capital. Hence, wages are limited by existing capital for paying wages. Thus, wage per worker can be derived by dividing the total circulating capital by the size of the working population. Wages can increase by an increase in the capital used in paying wages, or by decrease in the number of workers. If wages rise, supply of labour will rise. Competition among workers not only brings down wages, but also keeps some workers out of employment. This is based on Mill's notion that \"demand for commodities is not demand for labourers\". It means that income invested as advances of wages to labour creates employment, and not income spent on consumer goods. An increase in consumption causes a decline in investment. So increased investment leads to increases in the wage fund and to economic progress.\n\nIn 1869, Mill recanted his support of the Wage-Fund Doctrine due to recognition that capital is not necessarily fixed in that it can be supplemented through \"income of the employer which might otherwise go into saving or be spent on consumption.\"{{sfn|Spiegel|1991|p=390}} Walker{{who|date=November 2015}} also states in \"The Wages Question\" that the limits on capital and the growth in population \"were accidental, not essential\" to the formation of the doctrine. The limitation on the growth of industrial capacity placed a limit on the number of workers who could be accommodated more than the limit on capital. Furthermore, English agriculture \"had reached the condition of diminishing returns.\";{{sfn|Walker|1876|p=[https://archive.org/stream/wagesquestiontre00walkiala#page/142 142]}} therefore, each additional worker was not providing more output than he needed for himself for survival. Given the improvements in technology and productivity that followed 1848, the original reasons that gave rise to the doctrine were seen to be unusual and not the basis for a universal law.\n\n====Rate of capital accumulation====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\nAccording to Mill, the rate of capital accumulation depends on: (1) \"the amount of fund from which saving can be made\" or \"the size of the net produce of the industry\", and (2) the \"disposition to save\". Capital is the result of savings, and the savings come from the \"abstinence from present consumption for the sake of future goods\". Although capital is the result of saving, it is nevertheless consumed. This means saving is spending. Since saving depends on the net produce of the industry, it grows with profits and rent which go into making the net produce. On the other hand, the disposition to save depends on (1) the rate of profit and (2) the desire to save, or what Mill called \"effective desire of accumulation\". However, profit also depends on the cost of labour, and the rate of profit is the ratio of profits to wages. When profits rise or wages fall, the rate of profits increases, which in turn increases the rate of capital accumulation. Similarly, it is the desire to save which tends to increase the rate of capital accumulation.\n\n====Rate of profit====\nAccording to Mill, the ultimate tendency in an economy is for the rate of profit to decline due to diminishing returns in agriculture and increase in population at a Malthusian rate <ref>{{cite book |last1=Mill |first1=John Stuart |title=Principles of Political Economy |page=25 |url=http://eet.pixel-online.org/files/etranslation/original/Mill,%20Principles%20of%20Political%20Economy.pdf |accessdate=1 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Statue of John Stuart Mill on Victoria Embankment.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Mill near [[Victoria Embankment]] in London]]\n\n* Mill is the subject of a 1905 [[clerihew]] by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|E.

The concept is often invoked in political and legal contexts where facts and scientific results have a great amount of weight in making a determination.  It usually conveys a [[pejorative]] connotation that the research has been untowardly driven by political, ideological, financial, or otherwise unscientific motives.\n\nThe concept was popularized in the 1990s in relation to [[expert testimony]] in [[civil litigation]]. More recently, invoking the concept has been a tactic to criticize research on the harmful [[Environmentalism|environmental]] or [[public health]] effects of corporate activities, and occasionally in response to such criticism. The term has been used by proponents of both sides of such political debates. Author Dan Agin in his book ''[[Junk Science]]'' harshly criticized those who deny the basic premise of global warming,<ref name=\"Union-Tribune 2006-10-22\" /> while former [[Fox News]] commentator [[Steven Milloy]] has extensively denounced research linking the fossil fuel industry to climate change, on his website ''junkscience.com''.<ref name=\"Huffington Post 2014-03-06\" />\n\nIn some contexts, junk science is counterposed to the \"sound science\" or \"solid science\" that favors one's own point of view.<ref name=Neff2005>{{cite journal |vauthors= Neff RA, Goldman LR |title=Regulatory parallels to Daubert: stakeholder influence, \"sound science,\" and the delayed adoption of health-protective standards |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=95 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S81\u201391 |year=2005 |pmid=16030344 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.044818 |url= http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/full/95/S1/S81}}</ref> This dichotomy has been particularly promoted by Steven Milloy and the [[Advancement of Sound Science Center]], and is somewhat different from [[pseudoscience]] and [[fringe science]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe phrase ''junk science'' appears to have been in use prior to 1985. A 1985 [[United States Department of Justice]] report by the Tort Policy Working Group noted:\n<blockquote>The use of such invalid scientific evidence (commonly referred to as 'junk science') has resulted in findings of causation which simply cannot be justified or understood from the standpoint of the current state of credible scientific or medical knowledge.<ref>[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED274437 \"Report of the Tort Policy Working Group on the causes, extent and policy implications of the current crisis in insurance availability and affordability\"] (Rep. No. 027-000-01251-5). (1986, February). Washington, D.C.: Superintendent of Documents, US Government Printing Office. (ERIC Document Reproduction Service No. ED274437) p.39: <blockquote>Another way in which causation often is undermined \u2014 also an increasingly serious problem in toxic tort cases \u2014 is the reliance by judges and juries on non-credible scientific or medical testimony, studies or opinions. It has become all too common for 'experts' or 'studies' on the fringes of or even well beyond the outer parameters of mainstream scientific or medical views to be presented to juries as valid evidence from which conclusions may be drawn. The use of such invalid scientific evidence (commonly referred to as 'junk science') has resulted in findings of causation which simply cannot be justified or understood from the standpoint of the current state of credible scientific and medical knowledge.  Most importantly, this development has led to a deep and growing cynicism about the ability of tort law to deal with difficult scientific and medical concepts in a principled and rational way.</blockquote></ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1989, the climate scientist [[Jerry Mahlman]] (Director of the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]]) characterized the theory that [[global warming]] was due to [[solar variation]] (presented in ''Scientific Perspectives on the Greenhouse Problem'' by [[Frederick Seitz]] et al.) as \"noisy junk science.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = L. | year = 1989 | title = Global warming: Blaming the sun | url = | journal = Science | volume = 246 | issue = 4933| pages = 992\u2013993 | doi=10.1126/science.246.4933.992 | pmid=17806372}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter W. Huber]] popularized the term with respect to litigation in his 1991 book ''Galileo's Revenge: Junk Science in the Courtroom.''  The book has been cited in over 100 legal textbooks and references; as a consequence, some sources cite Huber as the first to coin the term.  By 1997, the term had entered the legal lexicon as seen in an opinion by [[Supreme Court of the United States]] Justice [[John Paul Stevens]]: \n<blockquote>An example of 'junk science' that should be excluded under the [[Daubert standard]] as too unreliable would be the testimony of a [[phrenologist]] who would purport to prove a defendant's future dangerousness based on the contours of the defendant's skull.<ref>''[[General Electric Company]] v. Robert K. Joiner'', No. 96\u2013188, slip op. at 4 (U.S. December 15, 1997).</ref></blockquote> Lower courts have subsequently set guidelines for identifying junk science, such as the 2005 opinion of [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] Judge [[Frank H. Easterbrook|Easterbrook]]:\n<blockquote>Positive reports about magnetic water treatment are not replicable; this plus the lack of a physical explanation for any effects are hallmarks of junk science.<ref>{{cite book| last= Huber| first= P. W. | year= 1991| edition= 2001| title= Galileo's revenge: Junk science in the courtroom| place= New York| publisher= Basic Books| page= 191}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs the subtitle of Huber's book, ''Junk Science in the Courtroom'', suggests, his emphasis was on the use or misuse of expert testimony in civil litigation.  One prominent example cited in the book was litigation over casual contact in the spread of [[AIDS]]. A California school district sought to prevent a young boy with AIDS, Ryan Thomas, from attending [[kindergarten]]. The school district produced an expert witness, Steven Armentrout, who testified that a possibility existed that AIDS could be transmitted to schoolmates through yet undiscovered \"vectors.\" However, five experts testified on behalf of Thomas that AIDS is not transmitted through casual contact, and the court affirmed the \"solid science\" (as Mr. Huber called it) and rejected Armentrout's argument.<ref>''Charles H. Sanderson v. [[Culligan International Company]]'', No. 04-3253, slip op. at 3 (7th Cir. July 11, 2005).</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] and others advocated public policies to improve the dissemination of valid environmental scientific knowledge and discourage junk science: \n<blockquote>The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] reports offer an antidote to junk science by articulating the current consensus on the prospects for climate change, by outlining the extent of the uncertainties, and by describing the potential benefits and costs of policies to address climate change.<ref>{{cite journal| last1= Ehrlich| first1= P.

In the first case, Agin discussed falsified results in the development of organic transistors: \n<blockquote>As far as understanding junk science is concerned, the important aspect is that both Bell Laboratories and the international physics community were fooled until someone noticed that noise records published by [[Jan Hendrik Sch\u00f6n]] in several papers were identical\u2014which means physically impossible.{{sfn|Agin|2006|p=39}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the second case, he cites an example that demonstrates ignorance of statistical principles in the lay press: \n<blockquote>Since no such proof is possible [that [[genetically modified food]] is harmless], the article in The New York Times was what is called a \"bad rap\" against the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2014a bad rap based on a junk-science belief that it's possible to prove a [[null hypothesis]].{{sfn|Agin|2006|p=63}}</blockquote>\n\nAgin asks the reader to step back from the rhetoric, as \"how things are labeled does not make a science junk science.\"{{sfn|Agin|2006|p=249}} In its place, he offers that junk science is ultimately motivated by the desire to hide undesirable truths from the public.\n\n==Use as corporate PR==\n\n[[John Stauber]] and [[Sheldon Rampton]] of ''[[PR Watch]]'' say the concept of junk science has come to be invoked in attempts to dismiss scientific findings that stand in the way of short-term corporate profits. In their book ''[[Trust Us, We're Experts]]'' (2001), they write that industries have launched multimillion-dollar campaigns to position certain theories as junk science in the popular mind, often failing to employ the [[scientific method]] themselves. For example, the [[tobacco industry]] has described research demonstrating the harmful effects of smoking and [[Passive smoking|second-hand smoke]] as junk science, through the vehicle of various [[astroturfing|astroturf groups]].\n\nTheories more favorable to corporate activities are portrayed in words as \"sound science.\" Past examples where \"sound science\" was used include the research into the toxicity of [[Alar]], which was heavily criticized by antiregulatory advocates, and [[Herbert Needleman]]'s research into low dose [[lead poisoning]]. Needleman was accused of fraud and personally attacked.<ref name=Neff2005/>\n\n[[Fox News]] commentator [[Steven Milloy]] often invokes the concept of junk science to attack the results of credible scientific research on topics like [[global warming]], [[ozone depletion]], and [[passive smoking]]. The credibility of Milloy's website junkscience.com was questioned by [[Paul D. Thacker]], a writer for ''[[The New Republic]]'', in the wake of evidence that Milloy had received funding from [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]], [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|RJR Tobacco]], and [[Exxon Mobil]].<ref name=\"tnr\">[http://www.tnr.com/article/pundit-hire \"Smoked Out: Pundit For Hire\"], published in ''The New Republic'', accessed 24 November 2010.</ref><ref>{{cite news |first1=Sheldon |last1=Rampton |authorlink1=Sheldon Rampton |first2=John |last2=Stauber |authorlink2=John Stauber |url=http://www.prwatch.org/files/pdfs/prwatch/prwv7n3.pdf |title=How Big Tobacco Helped Create 'the Junkman' |volume=7 |issue=3 |work=PR Watch |date=2000 |publisher=[[Center for Media and Democracy]]}}</ref><ref name=\"rjrmemo\">[http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/syq70d00 Activity Report], R.J.

group=\"NB\">[[Old Style and New Style dates|Old style date]]: 27 October</ref>{{spaced ndash}}14 February 1779) was a British explorer, navigator, cartographer, and captain in the [[Royal Navy]]. Cook made detailed maps of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] prior to making three voyages to the Pacific Ocean, during which he achieved the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of [[Australia]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and the first recorded [[circumnavigation]] of [[New Zealand]].\n\nCook joined the British [[merchant navy]] as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in 1755. He saw action in the [[Seven Years' War]] and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the [[Saint Lawrence River]] during the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|siege of Quebec]]. This helped bring Cook to the attention of the [[Admiralty]] and [[Royal Society]]. This acclaim came at a crucial moment in both Cook's career and the direction of British overseas exploration, and led to his commission in 1766 as commander of {{ship|HM Bark|Endeavour}} for the first of three Pacific voyages.\n\nIn three voyages, Cook sailed thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas of the globe. He mapped lands from New Zealand to Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean in greater detail and on a scale not previously achieved. As he progressed on his voyages of discovery, he surveyed and named features, and he recorded islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time. He displayed a combination of seamanship, superior surveying and cartographic skills, physical courage, and an ability to lead men in adverse conditions.\n\nCook was attacked and killed in 1779 during his third exploratory voyage in the Pacific while [[Kidnapping of Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu by Captain James Cook|attempting to kidnap]] [[Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu]], a [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] chief, in order to reclaim a [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] stolen from one of his ships.  He left a legacy of scientific and geographical knowledge which influenced his successors well into the 20th&nbsp;century, and numerous memorials worldwide have been dedicated to him.\n\n==Early life and family==\nJames Cook was born on 7 November 1728 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]) in the village of [[Marton, Middlesbrough|Marton]] in [[Yorkshire]] and baptised on 14 November (N.S.) in the [[parish church]] of [[Marton, Middlesbrough#St Cuthbert.27s Church|St Cuthbert]], where his name can be seen in the church register.<ref name=\"Rigby25\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Robson|2009|p=2}}</ref> He was the second of eight children of James Cook, a Scottish farm labourer from [[Ednam]] in [[Roxburghshire]], and his locally born wife, Grace Pace, from [[Thornaby-on-Tees]].<ref name=\"Rigby25\">{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|2002|p=25}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Stamp|1978|p=1}}</ref><ref name=\"collingridge\">{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003}}</ref> In 1736, his family moved to Airey Holme farm at [[Great Ayton]], where his father's employer, Thomas Skottowe, paid for him to attend the local school. In 1741, after five years' schooling, he began work for his father, who had been promoted to farm manager. For leisure, he would climb a nearby hill, [[Roseberry Topping]], enjoying the opportunity for solitude.<ref>{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=15}}</ref> [[Cooks' Cottage]], his parents' last home, which he is likely to have visited, is now in [[Melbourne]], Australia, having been moved from England and reassembled, brick by brick, in 1934.<ref name=\"horwitz\" />\n\nIn 1745, when he was 16, Cook moved {{convert|20|mi|km}} to the fishing village of [[Staithes]], to be apprenticed as a shop boy to grocer and [[haberdasher]] William Sanderson.<ref name=\"Rigby25\" /> Historians have speculated that this is where Cook first felt the lure of the sea while gazing out of the shop window.<ref name=\"collingridge\" />\n\nAfter 18 months, not proving suitable for shop work, Cook travelled to the nearby port town of [[Whitby]] to be introduced to friends of Sanderson's, John and Henry Walker.<ref name=\"horwitz\" /> The Walkers, who were [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], were prominent local ship-owners in the coal trade. Their house is now the [[Captain Cook Memorial Museum]]. Cook was taken on as a merchant navy apprentice in their small fleet of vessels, plying coal along the English coast. His first assignment was aboard the [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] ''Freelove'', and he spent several years on this and various other [[Coastal trading vessel|coasters]], sailing between the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] and London. As part of his apprenticeship, Cook applied himself to the study of [[algebra]], [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], [[navigation]] and [[astronomy]]\u2014all skills he would need one day to command his own ship.<ref name=\"collingridge\" />\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Batts Cook.jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth Batts Cook|Elizabeth Cook]], by William Henderson, 1830]]\n\nHis three-year apprenticeship completed, Cook began working on trading ships in the [[Baltic Sea]].

He stopped at Bustard Bay (now known as [[Seventeen Seventy, Queensland|Seventeen Seventy]]) on 23 May 1770. On 24 May, Cook and Banks and others went ashore.

On his first voyage, Cook had demonstrated by circumnavigating New Zealand that it was not attached to a larger landmass to the south. Although he charted almost the entire eastern coastline of Australia, showing it to be continental in size, the Terra Australis was believed to lie further south. Despite this evidence to the contrary, [[Alexander Dalrymple]] and others of the Royal Society still believed that a massive southern continent should exist.<ref>{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=182}}</ref>\n\n[[File:James Cook, English navigator, witnessing human sacrifice in Taihiti (Otaheite) c. 1773.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|James Cook witnessing human sacrifice in [[Tahiti]] c. 1773]]\n\nCook commanded {{HMS|Resolution|1771|6}} on this voyage, while [[Tobias Furneaux]] commanded its companion ship, {{HMS|Adventure|1771|6}}. Cook's expedition circumnavigated the globe at an extreme southern [[latitude]], becoming one of the first to cross the [[Antarctic Circle]] on 17 January 1773. In the Antarctic fog, ''Resolution'' and ''Adventure'' became separated. Furneaux made his way to New Zealand, where he lost some of his men during an encounter with [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], and eventually sailed back to Britain, while Cook continued to explore the Antarctic, reaching 71\u00b010'S on 31 January 1774.<ref name=\"G_Williams\" />\n\nCook almost encountered the mainland of [[Antarctica]] but turned towards Tahiti to resupply his ship. He then resumed his southward course in a second fruitless attempt to find the supposed continent. On this leg of the voyage, he brought a young Tahitian named [[Omai]], who proved to be somewhat less knowledgeable about the Pacific than [[Tupaia (navigator)|Tupaia]] had been on the first voyage. On his return voyage to New Zealand in 1774, Cook landed at the [[Tonga|Friendly Islands]], [[Easter Island]], [[Norfolk Island]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Vanuatu]].\n\n[[File:Cook-1777.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|James Cook's 1777 South-Up map of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#South Georgia|South Georgia]]]]\n\nBefore returning to England, Cook made a final sweep across the South Atlantic from [[Cape Horn]] and surveyed, mapped, and took possession for Britain of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]], which had been explored by the English merchant [[Anthony de la Roch\u00e9]] in 1675. Cook also discovered and named [[Clerke Rocks]] and the [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Sandwich Islands]] (\"Sandwich Land\"). He then turned north to [[South Africa]] and from there continued back to England. His reports upon his return home put to rest the popular myth of Terra Australis.<ref>{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=263}}</ref>\n\nCook's second voyage marked a successful employment of [[Larcum Kendall#K1|Larcum Kendall's K1]] copy of [[John Harrison]]'s H4 [[marine chronometer]], which enabled Cook to calculate his longitudinal position with much greater accuracy. Cook's log was full of praise for this time-piece which he used to make charts of the southern Pacific Ocean that were so remarkably accurate that copies of them were still in use in the mid-20th&nbsp;century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/package/30/links-cook.php|title=Captain James Cook: His voyages of exploration and the men that accompanied him|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=10 October 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421232853/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/package/30/links-cook.php|archivedate=21 April 2007|df=}}</ref>\n\nUpon his return, Cook was promoted to the rank of [[post-captain]] and given an honorary retirement from the Royal Navy, with a posting as an officer of the [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Greenwich Hospital]]. He reluctantly accepted, insisting that he be allowed to quit the post if an opportunity for active duty should arise.<ref name=\"Beaglehole\">{{harvnb|Beaglehole|1974|p=444}}</ref> His fame extended beyond the Admiralty; he was made a [[Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society]] and awarded the [[Copley Medal|Copley Gold Medal]] for completing his second voyage without losing a man to [[scurvy]].<ref name=\"Rigby79\">{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|p=79|2002}}</ref> [[Nathaniel Dance-Holland]] painted his portrait; he dined with [[James Boswell]]; he was described in the [[House of Lords]] as \"the first navigator in Europe\".<ref name=\"G_Williams\" /> But he could not be kept away from the sea. A third voyage was planned, and Cook volunteered to find the [[Northwest Passage]]. He travelled to the Pacific and hoped to travel east to the Atlantic, while a simultaneous voyage travelled the opposite route.<ref>{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=268}}</ref>\n\n===Third voyage (1776\u201379)===\n{{main|Third voyage of James Cook}}\n[[File:James Cook, Waimea Kauai.JPG|left|thumb|A statue of James Cook stands in [[Waimea, Kauai County, Hawaii|Waimea]], [[Kauai]] commemorating his first contact with the Hawaiian Islands at the town's harbour in January 1778]]\n\nOn his last voyage, Cook again commanded HMS ''Resolution'', while Captain [[Charles Clerke]] commanded {{HMS|Discovery|1774|6}}. The voyage was ostensibly planned to return the [[Pacific Islander]] [[Omai]] to Tahiti, or so the public was led to believe. The trip's principal goal was to locate a [[Northwest Passage]] around the American continent.<ref>{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=327}}</ref> After dropping Omai at Tahiti, Cook travelled north and in 1778 became the first European to begin formal contact with the [[Hawaiian Islands]].<ref name=\"Fish2011\">{{cite book|first=Shirley|last=Fish|title=The Manila-Acapulco Galleons : The Treasure Ships of the Pacific: With An Annotated List of the Transpacific Galleons 1565\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kk_iU0f-iT8C&pg=PA360|date=2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-7543-8|pages=360\u2013}}</ref> After his initial landfall in January 1778 at [[Waimea, Kauai County, Hawaii|Waimea]] harbour, [[Kauai]], Cook named the [[archipelago]] the \"Sandwich Islands\" after the [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|fourth Earl of Sandwich]]\u2014the acting [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]].<ref>{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=380}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Sandwich Islands, Cook sailed north and then northeast to explore the west coast of North America north of the Spanish settlements in [[Alta California]]. He made landfall on the [[Oregon]] coast at approximately 44\u00b030\u2032 north latitude, naming his landing point [[Cape Foulweather]]. Bad weather forced his ships south to about [[43rd parallel north|43\u00b0 north]] before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward.<ref>{{harvnb|Hayes|1999|pp=42\u20133}}</ref> He unknowingly sailed past the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] and soon after entered [[Nootka Sound]] on [[Vancouver Island]]. He anchored near the [[First Nations]] village of [[Yuquot, British Columbia|Yuquot]]. Cook's two ships remained in Nootka Sound from 29 March to 26 April 1778, in what Cook called Ship Cove, now Resolution Cove,<ref>{{cite bcgnis|18990|Resolution Cove|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> at the south end of [[Bligh Island (Canada)|Bligh Island]]. Relations between Cook's crew and the people of Yuquot were cordial but sometimes strained. In trading, the people of Yuquot demanded much more valuable items than the usual trinkets that had worked in Hawaii. Metal objects were much desired, but the lead, pewter, and tin traded at first soon fell into disrepute. The most valuable items which the British received in trade were [[sea otter]] pelts. During the stay, the Yuquot \"hosts\" essentially controlled the trade with the British vessels; the natives usually visited the British vessels at Resolution Cove instead of the British visiting the village of Yuquot at Friendly Cove.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fisher|1979}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving Nootka Sound, Cook explored and mapped the coast all the way to the [[Bering Strait]], on the way identifying what came to be known as [[Cook Inlet]] in Alaska. In a single visit, Cook charted the majority of the North American northwest coastline on world maps for the first time, determined the extent of Alaska, and closed the gaps in Russian (from the west) and Spanish (from the south) exploratory probes of the northern limits of the Pacific.<ref name=\"G_Williams\" />\n\n[[File:John Cleveley the Younger, Views of the South Seas (No. 3 of 4).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|HMS ''Resolution'' and ''Discovery'' in Tahiti]]\n\nBy the second week of August 1778, Cook was through the Bering Strait, sailing into the [[Chukchi Sea]]. He headed northeast up the coast of Alaska until he was blocked by sea ice. His furthest north was 70 degrees 44 minutes. Cook then sailed west to the [[Siberia|Siberian]] coast, and then southeast down the Siberian coast back to the Bering Strait. By early September 1778 he was back in the [[Bering Sea]] to begin the trip to the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Life of Captain James Cook|first=John Cawte|last=Beaglehole|date=1974|publisher=A & C Black|isbn=0-7136-1382-3|pages=615\u201323}}</ref> He became increasingly frustrated on this voyage and perhaps began to suffer from a stomach ailment; it has been speculated that this led to irrational behaviour towards his crew, such as forcing them to eat [[walrus]] meat, which they had pronounced inedible.<ref name=\"seven\" />\n\n===Return to Hawaii===\nCook returned to Hawaii in 1779. After sailing around the archipelago for some eight weeks, he made landfall at [[Kealakekua Bay]], on [[Hawaii (island)|'Hawaii Island']], largest island in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Archipelago]]. Cook's arrival coincided with the ''[[Makahiki]]'', a Hawaiian [[harvest festival]] of worship for the Polynesian god [[Lono]]. Coincidentally the form of Cook's ship, HMS ''Resolution'', or more particularly the mast formation, sails and rigging, resembled certain significant artefacts that formed part of the season of worship.<ref name=\"collingridge\" /><ref name=\"seven\" /> Similarly, Cook's clockwise route around the island of Hawaii before making landfall resembled the processions that took place in a clockwise direction around the island during the Lono festivals. It has been argued (most extensively by [[Marshall Sahlins]]) that such coincidences were the reasons for Cook's (and to a limited extent, his crew's) initial [[Apotheosis|deification]] by some Hawaiians who treated Cook as an incarnation of Lono.<ref name=\"Sahlins1985\">{{harvnb|Sahlins|1985}}</ref> Though this view was first suggested by members of Cook's expedition, the idea that any Hawaiians understood Cook to be Lono, and the evidence presented in support of it, were challenged in 1992.<ref name=\"seven\">{{harvnb|Obeyesekere|1992}}</ref><ref name=\"2nd ed\">{{harvnb|Obeyesekere|1997}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\n{{Main|Kidnapping of Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu by Captain James Cook}}\n[[File:Zoffany Death of Captain Cook.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''[[The Death of Captain James Cook (Zoffany)|The Death of Captain James Cook, 14 February 1779]]'', an unfinished painting by [[Johan Zoffany]], circa 1795.<ref name=\"NMM \u2013 The Death of Captain James Cook\">{{cite web|accessdate=11 July 2012|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/11916.html|title=The Death of Captain James Cook, 14 February 1779 \u2013 National Maritime Museum|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]}}</ref>]]\nAfter a month's stay, Cook attempted to resume his exploration of the northern Pacific. Shortly after leaving Hawaii Island, however, the ''Resolution'''s foremast broke, so the ships returned to Kealakekua Bay for repairs.\n\nTensions rose, and a number of quarrels broke out between the Europeans and Hawaiians at Kealakekua Bay. An unknown group of Hawaiians took one of Cook's small boats.

Cook took the king ([[Ali'i|ali\u02bbi nui]]) by his own hand and led him willingly away. One of Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu's favourite wives, [[Kanekapolei]], and two chiefs approached the group as they were heading to boats. They pleaded with the king not to go. An old [[kahuna]] (priest), chanting rapidly while holding out a coconut, attempted to distract Cook and his men as a large crowd began to form at the shore.

At that time the collection consisted of 115 artefacts collected on Cook's three voyages throughout the Pacific Ocean, during the period 1768\u201380, along with documents and memorabilia related to these voyages. Many of the [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] artifacts were collected at a time of first contact between [[Pacific Islander|Pacific Peoples]] and [[Europeans]]. In 1935 most of the documents and memorabilia were transferred to the Mitchell Library in the [[State Library of New South Wales]]. The provenance of the collection shows that the objects remained in the hands of Cook's widow Elizabeth Cook, and her descendants, until 1886. In this year John Mackrell, the great-nephew of [[Isaac Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Isaac Smith]], Elizabeth Cook's cousin, organised the display of this collection at the request of the NSW Government at the [[Colonial and Indian Exhibition]] in London. In 1887 the London-based [[Agent-General]] for the New South Wales Government, Saul Samuel, bought John Mackrell's items and also acquired items belonging to the other relatives Reverend Canon Frederick Bennett, Mrs Thomas Langton, H. M. C. Alexander, and William Adams. The collection remained with the Colonial Secretary of NSW until 1894, when it was transferred to the Australian Museum.<ref name=\"Thomsett, History of Acquisition\">{{cite web|last=Thomsett|first=Sue|title=Cook Collection, History of Acquisition|url=http://collections.australianmuseum.net.au/amweb/pages/am/NarrativeDisplay.php?irn=35&QueryPage=./NarrativeQuery.php|work=Electronic Museum Narrative|publisher=Australian Museum}}</ref>\n\n===Navigation and science===\nCook's 12 years sailing around the Pacific Ocean contributed much to European knowledge of the area. Several islands such as the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) were encountered for the first time by Europeans, and his more accurate navigational charting of large areas of the Pacific was a major achievement.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5AqNKtDqX0C&pg=PA222#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A voyage to the Pacific Ocean ... \u2013 Google Books|last1=Cook|first1=James|authorlink1=James Cook|last2=Clerke|first2=Charles|authorlink2=Charles Clerke|last3=Gore|first3=John|authorlink3=John Gore (Royal Navy captain)|last4=King|first4=James|authorlink4=James King (Royal Navy officer)|publisher=W. and A. Strahan|location=London|volume=2|accessdate=8 July 2014|date=1784}}</ref>\n\nTo create accurate maps, latitude and longitude must be accurately determined. Navigators had been able to work out latitude accurately for centuries by measuring the angle of the sun or a star above the horizon with an instrument such as a [[backstaff]] or [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]. Longitude was more difficult to measure accurately because it requires precise knowledge of the time difference between points on the surface of the earth. The Earth turns a full 360 degrees relative to the sun each day. Thus longitude corresponds to time: 15 degrees every hour, or 1 degree every 4 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/1304/Celestial-Sphere-Apparent-Motions-Sun-Moon-Planets-Stars.html|title=Celestial Sphere: The Apparent Motions of the Sun, Moon, Planets, and Stars \u2013 Earth, North, Axis, Approximately, Latitude, and Equator|date=2011|accessdate=26 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nCook gathered accurate longitude measurements during his first voyage by his navigational skills, the help of astronomer [[Charles Green (astronomer)|Charles Green]], and by using the newly published [[The Nautical Almanac|Nautical Almanac]] tables, via the [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]] method\u2014measuring the angular distance from the moon to either the sun during daytime or one of eight bright stars during night-time to determine the time at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], and comparing that to his local time determined via the altitude of the sun, moon, or stars. On his second voyage, Cook used the K1 chronometer made by [[Larcum Kendall]], which was the shape of a large [[pocket watch]], {{convert|5|in|cm}} in diameter. It was a copy of the [[John Harrison#The longitude watches|H4]] clock made by [[John Harrison]], which proved to be the first to keep accurate time at sea when used on the ship ''Deptford's'' journey to [[Jamaica]] in 1761\u201362.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dl.nfsa.gov.au/module/1318/|title=Captain Cook \u2013 Cook's Chronometer \u2013 English and Media Literacy, Documentaries|work=dl.nfsa.gov.au|date=2011|accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nCook succeeded in circumnavigating the world on his first voyage without losing a single man to [[scurvy]], an unusual accomplishment at the time. He tested several preventive measures, but the most important was frequent replenishment of fresh food.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fernandez-Armesto|2006|p=297}}</ref> It was for presenting a paper on this aspect of the voyage to the Royal Society that he was presented with the [[Copley Medal]] in 1776.<ref>{{harvnb|Stamp|1978|p=105}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/66/402|title=The Method Taken for Preserving the Health of the Crew of His Majesty's Ship the Resolution during Her Late Voyage Round the World|first=Captain James|last=Cook|publisher=Royal Society Publications|work=Philosophical Transactions|date=2011|accessdate=10 August 2011}}</ref> \n\nEver the observer, Cook was the first European to have extensive contact with various people of the Pacific. He correctly postulated a link among all the Pacific peoples, despite their being separated by great ocean stretches (see [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]]). Cook theorised that Polynesians originated from Asia, which scientist [[Bryan Sykes]] later verified.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sykes|2001}}</ref> \n\nIn New Zealand the coming of Cook is often used to signify the onset of colonisation.<ref name=\"collingridge\" /><ref name=\"horwitz\">{{Harvnb|Horwitz|2003}}</ref>\n\nCook carried several scientists on his voyages; they made significant observations and discoveries. Two botanists, [[Joseph Banks]] and Swede [[Daniel Solander]], were on the first voyage. The two collected over 3,000 plant species.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/nature-online/endeavour-botanical/about2.dsml|title=The Endeavour Botanical Illustrations at the Natural History Museum|work=nhm.ac.uk|date=2011|accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> Banks subsequently strongly promoted British settlement of Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/banks_sir_joseph.shtml|title=Sir Joseph Banks|publisher=BBC|date=2011|accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/solander-daniel-2677|title=Solander, Daniel (1733\u20131782)|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|first=L.

[[William Bligh]], Cook's sailing master, was given command of {{HMS|Bounty||6}} in 1787 to sail to Tahiti and return with [[breadfruit]]. Bligh is most known for the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny of his crew]] which resulted in his being set adrift in 1789.

The first recorded circumnavigation of the world by an animal was by Cook's goat, who made that memorable journey twice; the first time on HMS ''Dolphin'', under [[Samuel Wallis]], and then aboard ''Endeavour''. When they returned to England, Cook had the goat presented with a silver collar engraved with lines from [[Samuel Johnson]]: ''Perpetui, ambita bis terra, praemia lactis Haec habet altrici Capra secunda Jovis.'' (\"In fame scarce second to the nurse of Jove,/ This Goat, who twice the world had traversed round,/Deserving both her master's care and love,/Ease and perpetual pasture now has found.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Boswell|first=James|authorlink=James Boswell|title=Boswell's Life of Johnson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xvc_AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=boswell+Banks+goat&source=bl&ots=mY9-GPf8ce&sig=Xu3WUTdpc1kCSBXxJvXagVI8cTM&hl=en&ei=9louS_CTH5KklAepwLybBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result#v=onepage&q=boswell%20Banks%20goat&f=false|accessdate=14 September 2017|date=1772|publisher=Henry Frowde|page=144}}</ref>) She was put to pasture on Cook's farm outside London and was reportedly admitted to the privileges of the [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Royal Naval Hospital]] at Greenwich.

Baskerville was a member of the [[Royal Society of Arts]], and an associate of some of the members of the [[Lunar Society]]. He directed his [[Punchcutting|punchcutter]], John Handy, in the design of many [[typeface]]s of broadly similar appearance. In 1757, Baskerville published a remarkable quarto edition of [[Virgil]] on [[wove paper]], using his own type. It took three years to complete, but it made such an impact that he was appointed printer to the [[University of Cambridge]] the following year.<ref>Lyons, Martyn. (2011). Books: A living history.

He ruled the [[Soviet Union]] from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953, holding the titles of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1922 to 1952 and the nation's [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] from 1941 to 1953. Initially presiding over an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[one-party state|one-party]] system that [[plurality voting|governed by plurality]], he became the ''de facto'' [[dictator]] of the Soviet Union by the 1930s. Ideologically committed to the [[Leninist]] interpretation of [[Marxism]], Stalin helped to formalise these ideas as [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], while his own policies became known as [[Stalinism]].\n\n<!--Early life, revolutionary activity and rise to power-->\nBorn to a poor family in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), Stalin began his revolutionary career by joining the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as a youth. There, he edited the party's newspaper, ''[[Pravda]]'', and raised funds for [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Lenin's]] [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] faction via robberies, kidnappings and protection rackets. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia during the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]], Stalin joined the party's governing [[Politburo]], where he was instrumental in overseeing [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|the Soviet Union's establishment]] in 1922. As Lenin fell ill and then died in 1924, Stalin [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|assumed leadership over the country]]. During Stalin's rule, \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" became a central tenet of the party's dogma, and Lenin's [[New Economic Policy]] was replaced with a centralized [[command economy]]. Under the [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan system]], the country underwent [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivisation]] and rapid industrialization but experienced significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1932\u201333]]. To eradicate those regarded as \"[[enemies of the working class]]\", Stalin instituted the \"[[Great Purge]]\", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939.\n\n<!--Governance in the latter part of the 1930s through to his death-->\nStalin's government promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the [[Communist International]] and supported [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] movements throughout Europe during the 1930s, particularly in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1939, it signed a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]], resulting in their joint [[invasion of Poland]]. Germany ended the pact by [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]] in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet [[Red Army]] repelled the German incursion and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in 1945, ending [[World War II]] in Europe. The Soviets [[Occupation of the Baltic states|annexed the Baltic states]] and helped establish [[Communist state|Soviet-aligned governments]] throughout Central and Eastern Europe, China and North Korea. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as the two world [[superpower]]s. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed [[Eastern Bloc]] and U.S.-backed [[Western Bloc]] which became known as the [[Cold War]]. Stalin led his country through its post-war reconstruction, during which it [[Soviet atomic bomb project|developed a nuclear weapon]] in 1949. In these years, the country experienced [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|another major famine]] and an [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|anti-semitic]] campaign peaking in the [[doctors' plot]]. Stalin died in 1953 and was eventually succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|denounced his predecessor]] and initiated a [[de-Stalinisation]] process throughout Soviet society.\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive [[Stalin's cult of personality|personality cult]] within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, for whom Stalin was a champion of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]] and the working class. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repressions, [[ethnic cleansing]], hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines which caused the deaths of millions.\n<!--please do not remove, for ToC spacing-->\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Joseph Stalin}}\n\n===Childhood to young adulthood: 1878\u20131899===\nStalin was born in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] town of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]]{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=11}} on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6 December}}.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=23}}{{efn|Although there is an inconsistency among published sources about Stalin's year and date of birth, Ioseb Jughashvili is found in the records of the Uspensky Church in Gori, Georgia as born on 18 December ([[Julian calendar|Old Style]]: 6 December) 1878. This birth date is maintained in his School Leaving Certificate, his extensive tsarist Russia police file, a police arrest record from 18 April 1902 which gave his age as 23 years, and all other surviving pre-Revolution documents.

There, [[Khrushchev Thaw|Khrushchev denounced Stalin]] for both his mass repression and his personality cult.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=314|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2pp=577\u2013579|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=594}} He repeated these denunciations at the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|22nd Party Congress]] in October 1962.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=594}} In October 1961, Stalin's body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] next to the [[Kremlin wall]]s, the location marked only by a simple bust.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=576|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=594}}\n\nKhrushchev's de-Stalinisation process in Soviet society ended when he was replaced as leader by [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1964; the latter introduced a level of re-Stalinisation within the Soviet Union.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=315|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=595}} In 1969 and again in 1979, plans were proposed for a full rehabilitation of Stalin's legacy; both were defeated by complaints both domestically and from foreign Communist parties.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=315}} Gorbachev saw the total denunciation of Stalin as being necessary for the regeneration of Soviet society.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=596}} After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the first President of the new Russian Federation, [[Boris Yeltsin]], also retained Gorbachev's denunciation of Stalin but added to it a denunciation of Lenin.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=596}} His successor, [[Vladimir Putin]], did not seek to rehabilitate Stalin but placed an emphasis on celebrating Soviet achievement under Stalin's leadership rather than the repressions.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=596\u2013597}}\n\n[[File:RIAN archive 535278 Laying flowers and wreaths to Iosif Stalin's grave at Kremlin wall.jpg|thumb|left|Marxist\u2013Leninist activists laying wreaths at Stalin's grave in 2009]]\nAmid the social and economic turmoil of the post-Soviet period, many Russians viewed Stalin as having overseen an era of order, predictability, and pride.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=598}} He remains a revered figure among many Russian nationalists, who feel nostalgic about the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II]],{{sfn|Service|2004|p=7}} and he is regularly invoked approvingly within both Russia's far-left and far-right.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=599}} In the 2008 ''[[Name of Russia (Russia TV)|Name of Russia]]'' television show, Stalin was voted as the third most notable personality in Russian history.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Parfitt, Tom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/29/stalin-name-of-russia |title=Greatest Russian poll |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=29 December 2008 |accessdate=25 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905093339/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/29/stalin-name-of-russia |archive-date=5 September 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A 2017 poll revealed that Stalin's popularity reached a 16-year high among the Russian population, with 46% expressing a favourable view of him.<ref>{{cite news|last= Taylor|first= Adam|date= 15 February 2017|title= Positive views of Stalin among Russians reach 16-year high, poll shows|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/15/positive-views-of-stalin-among-russians-reach-16-year-high-poll-shows/|work= [[The Washington Post]]|location= |access-date= 30 April 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170320040114/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/15/positive-views-of-stalin-among-russians-reach-16-year-high-poll-shows/|archive-date= 20 March 2017|dead-url= no|df= dmy-all}}</ref> At the same time, there was a growth in pro-Stalinist literature in Russia, much of which relies upon the misrepresentation or fabrication of source material.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=x}} In this literature, Stalin's repressions are regarded either as a necessary measure to defeat \"enemies of the people\" or the result of lower-level officials acting without Stalin's knowledge.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=x}} In October 2017, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] has commented on Stalinist repressions while opening the [[Wall of Grief]] memorial in Moscow, saying \"This terrible past can not be erased from the national memory, and it cannot be justified by anything, not even by the so-called highest interests of the welfare of the people.\"<ref name=\"memorial\">\"[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41809659 Wall of Grief: Putin opens first Soviet victims memorial] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605175715/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41809659 |date=5 June 2018 }}\".

(disambiguation){{!}}Jan}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{Month header}}\n{{Calendar}}\n'''January''' is the first month of the year in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s and the first of seven months to have a length of 31 days. The first day of the month is known as [[New Year's Day]]. It is, on average, the coldest month of the year within most of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] (where it is the second month of winter) and the warmest month of the year within most of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] (where it is the second month of summer). In the Southern hemisphere, January is the seasonal equivalent of July in the Northern hemisphere and vice versa.\n\n[[Ancient Roman]] observances during this month include [[Cervula]], and [[Juvenalia]]; celebrated January 1, as well as one of three  [[Agonalia]], celebrated January 9, and [[Carmentalia]], celebrated January 11. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry Janvier.jpg|thumb|January, from the ''[[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'']]\n\nJanuary  (in Latin, ''[[Ianuarius]]'') is named after the [[Latin]] word for door (''ianua''), since January is the door to the year and an opening to new beginnings. The month is conventionally thought of as being named after [[Janus]], the god of beginnings and transitions in [[Roman mythology]], but according to ancient Roman farmers' almanacs [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] was the [[tutelary deity]] of the month.<ref>[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 51.</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the original [[Roman calendar]] consisted of 10 months totaling 304 days, winter being considered a month-less period. Around 713 BC, the semi-mythical successor of [[Romulus]], King [[Numa Pompilius]], is supposed to have added the months of January and [[February]], so that the calendar covered a standard lunar year (354 days). Although [[March]] was originally the first month in the old Roman calendar, January became the first month of the calendar year either under Numa or under the [[Decemvirs]] about 450&nbsp;BC (Roman writers differ). In contrast, each specific calendar year was identified by the names of the two [[consul]]s, who entered office on May 1{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} or March 15 until 153&nbsp;BC, from when they entered office on January 1.\n\nVarious Christian feast dates were used for the [[New Year]] in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]], including March 25 ([[Feast of the Annunciation]]) and December 25. However, medieval calendars were still displayed in the Roman fashion with twelve columns from January to December. Beginning in the 16th century, European countries began officially making January 1 the start of the New Year once again\u2014sometimes called ''Circumcision Style'' because this was the date of the [[Feast of the Circumcision]], being the seventh day after December 25.\n\nHistorical names for January include its original Roman designation, Ianuarius, the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] term ''Wulf-monath'' (meaning \"wolf month\") and [[Charlemagne]]'s designation Wintarmanoth (\"winter / cold month\"). In [[Slovene language|Slovene]], it is traditionally called ''prosinec''. The name, associated with [[millet]] bread and the act of asking for something, was first written in 1466 in the [[\u0160kofja Loka]] manuscript.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-93FLIZJH/ |title=Ob petstoletnici \u0161kofjelo\u0161kega zapisa slovenskih imen za mesece |language=Slovenian |trans-title=On the 500th Anniversary of the \u0160kofja Loka Recording of Slovene Month Names |first=Jo\u017ee |last=Stabej |journal=Lo\u0161ki razgledi |year=1966 |volume=13 |publisher=Muzejsko dru\u0161tvo \u0160kofja Loka [Museum Society of \u0160kofja Loka] |issn=0459-8210 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108042550/http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-93FLIZJH |archivedate=2014-01-08 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Theodor Mommsen]],<ref>''The History of Rome'', volume 4, The Revolution, {{ISBN|1-4353-4597-5}}, page 4</ref> 1 January became the first day of the year in 600 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] of the Roman calendar (153&nbsp;BC), due to disasters in the [[Lusitanian War]]. A Lusitanian chief called Punicus invaded the Roman territory, defeated two Roman governors, and killed their troops. The Romans resolved to send a consul to [[Hispania]], and in order to accelerate the dispatch of aid, \"they even made the new consuls enter into office two months and a half before the legal time\" (March 15).\n\n==January symbols==\n[[File:Sneeuw1.jpg|thumb|Snow in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] in the month of January]]\n*[[File:GarnetEZ.jpg|alt=Garnet gemstone|thumb|[[Garnet]] gemstone]]January's birthstone is the [[garnet]], which represents constancy.\n*[[File:Galanthus nivalis close-up aka.jpg|alt=Snowdrop (Galanthus) flower|thumb|[[Galanthus|Snowdrop]] (''Galanthus'') flower]]Its birth flower is the cottage pink ''[[Dianthus caryophyllus]]'' or [[galanthus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birthflowersguide.com/january-birth-flower.html|title=January Birth Flower : Flower Meaning|work=birthflowersguide.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006090545/http://www.birthflowersguide.com/january-birth-flower.html|archivedate=2008-10-06|df=}}</ref>\n*The Chinese floral emblem of January is the ''[[Prunus mume]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n*The Japanese floral emblem of January is the [[camellia]] (''[[Camellia sinensis]]'').{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n*In Finnish, the month of ''tammikuu'' means the heart of the winter and because the name literally means \"[[oak]] moon\", it can be inferred that the oak tree is the heart of the grand forest with many valuable trees as opposed to the typical Arctic forests, which are typically pine and spruce.

and \"'''The Golden Arm'''\", was an [[American football]] player in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He spent the majority of his career playing for the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]]. He was a record-setting [[quarterback]], and the NFL's most valuable player in 1959, 1964, and 1967. For 52 years he held the record for [[Most consecutive games with a touchdown pass (NFL)|most consecutive games with a touchdown pass]] (which he set between 1956 and 1960), until quarterback [[Drew Brees]] broke his long standing record on October 7, 2012. Unitas was the prototype of the modern era marquee quarterback with a strong passing game, media fanfare, and widespread popularity. He has been consistently listed as one of the greatest NFL players of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2009/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&id=4838773|title=Playoffs raise historical stakes|publisher=espn.com|date=|accessdate=2010-01-19}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Constantine Unitas was born in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1933 to Francis J.

Attending [[St. Justin's High School]] in Pittsburgh, Unitas played [[halfback (American football)|halfback]] and quarterback. After high school, he looked for an opportunity to play college football.\n\nThe [[University of Louisville]] offered him the chance and Unitas left home to play for the Cardinals.\n\n==College career==\nIn his younger years, Unitas dreamed about being part of the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame but when he tried out for the team, coach [[Frank Leahy]] simply said that he was just too skinny and he would \"get murdered\" if he was put on the field.\n\nIn his four-year career as a [[Louisville Cardinals|Louisville Cardinal]], Unitas completed 245 passes for 3,139 yards and 27 touchdowns. Reportedly, the 6-foot-1 Unitas weighed 145 pounds on his first day of practice at Louisville. Unitas's first start was in the fifth game of the 1951 season against St. Bonaventure, where he threw 11 consecutive passes and three touchdowns to give the Cardinals a 21\u201319 lead. Louisville ended up losing the game 22\u201321 on a disputed field goal, but found a regular. Unitas completed 12 of 19 passes for 240 yards and four touchdowns in a 35\u201328 victory over Houston. The team finished the season 5\u20135 overall and 4\u20131 with Unitas as the starting quarterback. As a freshman, Unitas completed 46 of 99 passes for 602 yards and nine touchdowns (44).\n\nBy the 1952 season, the university decided to de-emphasize sports. The new president at Louisville, Dr. Philip Grant Davidson, reduced the amount of athletic aid, and tightened academic standards for athletes. As a result, 15 returning players could not meet the new standards and lost their scholarships. But Unitas maintained his scholarship by taking on a new elective: square dancing. In 1952, coach [[Frank Camp]] switched the team to [[two-way football]]. Unitas not only played [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] or linebacker on defense and quarterback on offense but returned kicks and punts on special teams. The Cards won their first game against Wayne State, and then Florida State in the second game. Unitas completed 16 of 21 passes for 198 yards and three touchdowns. It was said that Unitas put on such a show at the Florida State game that he threw a pass under his legs for 15 yards. The rest of the season was a struggle for the Cards, who finished 3\u20135. Unitas completed 106 of 198 passes for 1,540 yards and 12 touchdowns in his sophomore year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guide.provations.com/louisvillefootball/2011mg#pg173 |title=Louisville Football 2011 Media Guide |publisher=Guide.provations.com |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe team won their first game in 1953, against [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]], and lost the rest for a record of 1\u20137. One of the most memorable games of the season came in a 59\u20136 loss against Tennessee. Unitas completed 9 of 19 passes for 73 yards, rushed 9 times for 52 yards, returned 6 kickoffs for eighty-five yards, 1 punt for three yards, and had 86 percent of the team's tackles. The only touchdown the team scored was in the fourth quarter when Unitas made a fake pitch to the running back and ran the ball 23 yards for a [[touchdown]]. Unitas was hurt later in the fourth quarter while trying to run the ball. On his way off the field, he received a standing ovation. When he got to the locker room he was so worn that his jersey and shoulder pads had to be cut off because he could not lift his arms. Louisville ended the season with a 20\u201313 loss to Eastern Kentucky. In his junior year, Unitas completed 49 of 95 passes for 470 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nUnitas was elected captain for the 1954 season, but due to an early injury did not see much playing time. His first start was the third game of the season, against Florida State. Of the 34-man team, 21 were freshmen. The 1954 Cardinals went 3\u20136, with their last win at home against Morehead State. Unitas was slowed by so many injuries his senior year his 527 passing yards ended second to Jim Houser's 560.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Pittsburgh Steelers===\nAfter his collegiate career, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] of the NFL drafted Unitas in the ninth round. However, Unitas was released before the season began as the odd man out among four quarterbacks trying to fill three spots. Steelers' head coach [[Walt Kiesling]] had made up his mind about Unitas; he thought he was not smart enough to quarterback an NFL team,<ref>Dan Rooney: My 75 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the NFL, {{ISBN|0-306-81569-9}}; p. 62.</ref> and Unitas was not given any snaps in practice with the Steelers. Among those edging out Unitas was [[Ted Marchibroda]], future longtime NFL head coach. Out of pro football, Unitas\u2014by this time married\u2014worked in construction in Pittsburgh to support his family.<ref>MacCambridge, 2005 pg. 124</ref> On the weekends, he played quarterback, safety and punter on a local [[semi-professional]] team called the [[Bloomfield (Pittsburgh)|Bloomfield]] Rams for $6 a game.<ref>Cavanaugh, 2008 pg. 166</ref>\n\n===Baltimore Colts===\nIn 1956, Unitas joined the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] of the NFL under legendary coach [[Weeb Ewbank]], after being asked at the last minute to join Bloomfield Rams lineman Jim Deglau, a Croatian steel worker with a life much like Unitas', at the latter's scheduled Colts tryout. The pair borrowed money from friends to pay for the gas to make the trip. Deglau later told a reporter after Unitas' death, \"[His] uncle told him not to come. [He] was worried that if he came down and the Colts passed on him, it would look bad (to other NFL teams).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/bal-sp.unitas20oct20,0,3496272.story?page=7&coll=dp-breaking-news|title=Youngster's drive couldn't be sacked|publisher=dailypress.com |date=2002-10-20|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> The Colts signed Unitas, much to the chagrin of the [[Cleveland Browns]], who had hoped to claim the rejected Steeler quarterback.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburgpost-gazette.com/sports/columnists/20020917webfinder0917p1.asp|title=Unitas set the QB gold standard|publisher=Pittsburgpost-gazette.com|date=2002-09-17|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref>\n\nUnitas made his NFL debut with an inauspicious \"mop-up\" appearance against Detroit, going 0-2 with one interception.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/bal-sp.unitas21oct21,0,16118.story|title=Unitas' first pass wasn't a Bears' TD|first=Baltimore|last=Sun|publisher=}}</ref> Two weeks later, starting quarterback George Shaw suffered a broken leg against the [[Chicago Bears]]. In his first serious action, Unitas' initial pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown. Then he botched a hand-off on his next play, a fumble recovered by the Bears. Unitas rebounded quickly from that 58\u201327 loss, leading the Colts to an upset of [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]] and their first win over Cleveland. He threw nine touchdown passes that year, including one in the season finale that started his record 47-game streak. His 55.6-percent completion mark was a rookie record.\n\nIn 1957, his first season as the Colts full-time starter at quarterback, Unitas finished first in the NFL in passing yards (2,550) and touchdown passes (24) as he helped lead the Colts to a 7\u20135 record, the first winning record in franchise history. At season's end, Unitas received the [[Jim Thorpe Trophy]] as the [[NFL MVP|NFL's Most Valuable Player]] by the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA).\n\n====1958: \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\"====\nUnitas continued his prowess in 1958 passing for 2,007 yards and 19 touchdowns as the Colts won the Western Conference title. The Colts won the [[NFL championship]] under Unitas' leadership on December 28, 1958, by defeating the [[New York Giants]] 23\u201317 in [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] overtime on a touchdown by fullback [[Alan Ameche]]. It was the first overtime game in NFL history, and is often referred to as the \"[[1958 NFL Championship Game|greatest game ever played]]\". The game, nationally televised by [[NBC]], has been credited for sparking the rise in popularity of professional football during the 1960s.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gregory|first1=Sean|title=The Football Game that Changed It All|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1868793_1868792_1868802,00.html|accessdate=January 18, 2017|work=Time|date=December 29, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====1959 MVP season====\nIn 1959, Unitas was named the NFL's MVP by the [[Associated Press]] (AP) for the first time,{{efn|Contemporary sources and [[Pro-Football-Reference.com]] recognize Unitas as the 1959 AP MVP,<ref>{{cite news|title=Unitas Named Player Of Year In Pro Football|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&dat=19591223&id=Fh8fAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EJoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6203,3662328|accessdate=January 9, 2017|work=The Tuscaloosa News|agency=Associated Press|date=December 24, 1959|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=AP NFL Most Valuable Player Winners|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/awards/ap-nfl-mvp-award.htm|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 20, 2016}}</ref> while others, including the ''2015 Official NFL Record and Fact Book'', list [[Charlie Conerly]] as winning the award.<ref>{{cite book|title=2015 Official NFL Record and Fact Book|date=2015|publisher=National Football League|page=524|url=https://nflcommunications.com/Documents/2015%20NFL%20Record%20and%20Fact%20Book.pdf|accessdate=August 1, 2016|editor1-last=Lee |editor1-first=Brenden |editor2-last=Gellerman |editor2-first=Jacob |editor3-last=King |editor3-first=Robert}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=National Football League MVPs By The Associated Press|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&dat=19910108&id=5akfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ndYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2653,730199|accessdate=January 9, 2017|work=Gadsden Times|agency=Associated Press|date=January 8, 1991|page=B2}}</ref>}} as well as [[United Press International]]'s player of the year, after leading the NFL in passing yards (2,899), touchdown passes (32), and completions (193).

The Colts finished 8\u20136 in Shula's first season at the helm, good enough for only third place in the NFL's Western Conference but they did end the season on a strong note by winning their final three games.<ref name=\"sportsecyclopedia.com\"/> The season was very successful for Unitas personally as he led the NFL in passing yards with a career-best total of 3,481 and also led in completions with 237.\n\n====1964 MVP season====\nThe [[1964 Baltimore Colts season|1964 season]] would see the Colts return to the top of the Western Conference. After dropping their season opener to the [[1964 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], the Colts ran off 10 straight victories to finish with a 12\u20132 record. The season was one of Unitas' best as he finished with 2,824 yards passing, a league-best 9.26 yards per pass attempt, 19 touchdown passes and only 6 interceptions. He was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player by the AP and UPI for a second time. However, the season would end on a disappointing note for the Colts as they were upset by the Cleveland Browns in the [[1964 NFL Championship Game]], losing 27\u20130.\n\nUnitas resumed his torrid passing in 1965, as he threw for 2,530 yards, 23 touchdowns and finished with a league-high and career best 97.1 passer rating. But he was lost for the balance of the season due to a knee injury in a week 12 loss to the Bears. More postseason heartbreak would follow in 1965. The Colts and Packers finished in a tie for first place in the Western Conference and a one-game [[1965 NFL playoffs|playoff]] was played in Green Bay to decide who would be the conference representative in the [[1965 NFL Championship Game]]. The Colts lost in overtime 13\u201310 due in large part to a game-tying field goal by [[Don Chandler]] that many say was incorrectly ruled good. Backup quarterback [[Gary Cuozzo]] also suffered a season-ending injury the following week and it would be running back [[Tom Matte]] who filled in as the emergency QB for the regular-season finale and the playoff loss to the Packers.\n\nUnitas, healthy once more, threw for 2748 yards and 22 touchdowns in 1966 in a return to [[Pro Bowl]] form. However, he posted a league-high 24 interceptions.\n\n====1967 MVP season====\nAfter once again finishing 2nd in the Western Conference in 1966, the Colts rebounded to finish 11\u20131\u20132 in 1967 tying the Los Angeles Rams for the NFL's best record. In winning his third MVP award from the AP and UPI in 1967 (and his second from the NEA), Unitas had a league-high 58.5 completion percentage and passed for 3,428 yards and 20 touchdowns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Unitas_Johnny.html|work=ESPN Classic|title=Unitas surprised them all|publisher=Espn.go.com|date=|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> He openly complained about having [[tennis elbow]] <ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1080371/index.htm | work=CNN | title=It's Johnny U.

Once again, the season ended in heartbreak for the Colts, as they were shut out of the newly instituted four team NFL playoff after losing the divisional tiebreaker to the Rams, a 34\u201310 rout in the regular season finale.\n\n====Super Bowls and final Colt years====\nIn the final game of the 1968 preseason, the muscles in Unitas' arm were torn when he was hit by a member of the Dallas Cowboys defense. Unitas wrote in his autobiography that he felt his arm was initially injured by the use of the \"night ball\" that the NFL was testing for better TV visibility during night games. In a post-game interview the previous year, he noted having constant pain in his elbow for several years prior.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1080371/2/index.htm | work=CNN | title=It's Johnny U. Again | date=October 2, 1967}}</ref> He would spend most of the season sitting on the bench. The Colts still marched to a league-best 13\u20131 record behind backup quarterback and ultimate 1968 NFL MVP [[Earl Morrall]]. Although he was injured through most of the season, Unitas came off the bench to play in [[Super Bowl III]], the famous game where [[Joe Namath]] guaranteed a [[New York Jets]] win despite conventional wisdom. Unitas' insertion was a desperation move in an attempt to retrieve dominance of the NFL over the upstart [[American Football League|AFL]]. Although the Colts won an [[1968 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship in 1968]], they lost the Super Bowl to the AFL Champion New York Jets, thus becoming the first ever NFL champions that were not also deemed world champions. Unitas helped put together the Colts' only score, a touchdown late in the game. Unitas also drove the Colts into scoring position following the touchdown and successful onside kick, but for reasons that to this day are unknown, head coach Don Shula eschewed a field goal attempt, which (if successful) would have cut the Jets' lead to 16-10. Despite not playing until late in the third quarter, Unitas still finished the game with more passing yards than the team's starter, Earl Morrall.\n\nAfter an off-season of rehabilitation on his elbow, Unitas rebounded in 1969, passing for 2342 yards and twelve touchdowns with 20 interceptions. But the Colts finished with a disappointing 8-5-1 record, and missed the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/clt/1969.htm|title=1969 Baltimore Colts Statistics & Players - Pro-Football-Reference.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the NFL and AFL had merged into one league, and the Colts moved to the new [[American Football Conference]], along with the [[Cleveland Browns]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Unitas threw for 2213 yards and 14 touchdowns while leading the Colts to an 11-2-1 season. In their first rematch with the Jets, Unitas and Namath threw a combined nine interceptions in a 29-22 Colts win. Namath threw 62 passes and broke his hand on the final play of the game, ending his season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/clt/1970.htm|title=1970 Baltimore Colts Statistics & Players - Pro-Football-Reference.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nUnitas threw for 390 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions in AFC playoff victories over the Cincinnati Bengals and the Oakland Raiders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/U/UnitJo00/gamelog/post/|title=Johnny Unitas Playoffs Game Log - Pro-Football-Reference.com|publisher=}}</ref> In [[Super Bowl V]] against the [[Dallas Cowboys]], he was knocked out of the game with a rib injury in the second quarter, soon after throwing a 75-yard touchdown pass (setting a then-Super Bowl record) to [[John Mackey (American football)|John Mackey]]. However, he had also tossed two interceptions before his departure from the game. [[Earl Morrall]] came in to lead the team to a last second, 16-13 victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197101170clt.htm|title=Super Bowl V - Dallas Cowboys  vs.  Baltimore Colts - January 17th, 1971 - Pro-Football-Reference.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Final years====\nIn 1971, Unitas split playing time with Morrall, throwing only three touchdown passes. He started both playoff games, a win over the Cleveland Browns that sent the Colts to the [[AFC Championship game]] against the [[Miami Dolphins]], which they lost by a score of 21\u20130. Unitas threw three interceptions in the game, one of which was returned for a touchdown by safety [[Dick Anderson]].\n\nThe 1972 season saw the Colts declining into mediocrity. After losing the season opener, Unitas was involved in the second and final regular season head-to-head meeting with \"Broadway\" Joe Namath. The first was in 1970 (won by the Colts, 29\u201322). The last meeting was a memorable one, which took place on September 24, 1972, at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]]. Unitas threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns, but Namath upstaged him again, bombing the Colts for 496 yards and six touchdowns in a 44\u201334 Jets victory&nbsp;\u2013 their first over Baltimore since the 1970 merger.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1970/ |title=1970 NFL Standings, Team & Offensive Statistics |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1971/ |title=1971 NFL Standings, Team & Offensive Statistics |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref> After losing four of their first five games, the Colts fired head coach Don McCafferty, and benched Unitas.\n\nOne of the more memorable moments in football history came on Unitas' last game in a Colts uniform at Memorial Stadium, in a game against the [[Buffalo Bills]]. Unitas was not the starter for this game, but the Colts were blowing the Bills out by a score of 28\u20130 behind [[Marty Domres]]; Unitas entered the game due to the fans chanting, \"We want Unitas!!!\", and a plan devised by head coach [[John Sandusky]] to convince Unitas that the starting quarterback was injured. Unitas came onto the field, and threw two passes, one of which was a long touchdown to wide receiver [[Eddie Hinton (American football)|Eddie Hinton]] which would be his last pass as a Colt. The Colts won the game by the score of 35\u20137.\n\n====San Diego, retirement, and records====\nUnitas was traded to the [[San Diego Chargers]] in 1973 after posting a 5-9 record in 1972 with Baltimore, but he was far past his prime. He replaced former Chargers quarterback [[John Hadl]]. He was replaced in Baltimore by [[Marty Domres]], who had been acquired from the [[San Diego Chargers]] in August, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballperspective.com/remembering-earl-morrall/|title=Remembering Earl Morrall|date=30 April 2014|publisher=}}</ref> Domres was ultimately replaced by LSU's [[Bert Jones]], drafted with the number two overall pick in 1973. Unitas started the season with a 38-0 loss to the [[Washington Redskins]]. He threw for just 55 yards and 3 interceptions, and was sacked 8 times. His final victory as a starter came against the [[Buffalo Bills]] in week two. Unitas was 10-18 for 175 yards, two touchdown passes, and no interceptions in a 34-7 Chargers rout .<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197309230sdg.htm Buffalo Bills at San Diego Chargers - September 23rd, 1973 - Pro-Football-Reference.com</ref> Unitas was clearly not the same player he was years ago and many were questioning his role as a starter after a loss to the Bengals in week three. Two weeks later, he threw two first-half interceptions, passed for only 19 yards, and went 2-for-9 against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. He was then replaced by rookie quarterback, future Hall-of-Famer [[Dan Fouts]]. After having posted a 1-3 record as a starter, Unitas retired in the preseason of 1974.\n\nUnitas finished his 18 NFL seasons with 2,830 completions in 5,186 attempts for 40,239 yards and 290 touchdowns, with 253 interceptions. He also rushed for 1,777 yards and 13 touchdowns. Plagued by arm trouble in his later seasons, he threw more interceptions (64) than touchdowns (38) in 1968\u20131973. After averaging 215.8 yards per game in his first twelve seasons, his production fell to 124.4 in his final six. His [[passer rating]] plummeted from 82.9 to 60.4 for the same periods. Even so, Unitas set many passing records during his career. He was the first quarterback to throw for more than 40,000 yards, despite playing during an era when NFL teams played shorter seasons of 12 or 14 games (as opposed to today's 16-game seasons) and prior to modern passing-friendly rules implemented in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/content/dead-ball-era-career-passer-rating-leaders/6535/|title=Dead Ball Era career passer rating leaders|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914013530/http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/content/dead-ball-era-career-passer-rating-leaders/6535/|archivedate=2013-09-14|df=}}</ref> His 32 touchdown passes in 1959 were a record at the time, making Unitas the first QB to hit the 30 touchdown mark in a season. His 47-game consecutive touchdown streak between 1956 and 1960 was a record considered by many to be unbreakable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/333799-the-greatest-individual-streaks-in-sport#/articles/333799-the-greatest-individual-streaks-in-sport/page/11|title=The Greatest Individual Streaks in Sport|first=Boris|last=Godzinevski|publisher=}}</ref> The streak stood for 52 years before being broken by [[New Orleans Saints]] quarterback [[Drew Brees]] in a game against the San Diego Chargers on October 7, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8476259/drew-brees-breaks-johnny-unitas-record-consecutive-games-td-pass-front-suspended-coach-sean-payton|title=Drew Brees breaks Unitas' mark|publisher=Espn.go.com|date=|accessdate=2012-07-10}}</ref>\n\n===Post-playing days===\nAfter his playing days were finished, Unitas settled in Baltimore where he raised his family while also pursuing a career in broadcasting, doing [[color commentator|color commentary]] for NFL games on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] in the 1970s. He was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1979. After [[Robert Irsay]] [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|moved the Colts franchise]] to [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] in 1984, a move reviled to this day in Baltimore as \"Bob Irsay's Midnight Ride,\" Unitas was so outraged that he cut all ties to the relocated team (though his No. 19 jersey is still retired by the Colts), declaring himself strictly a ''Baltimore'' Colt for the remainder of his life. Some other prominent old-time Colts followed his lead, although many attended the 1975 team's reunion at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] in Indianapolis in 2009. A total of 39 Colts players from that 1975 team attended said reunion in Indianapolis, including [[Bert Jones]] and [[Lydell Mitchell]]. Unitas asked the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] on numerous occasions (including on [[Roy Firestone]]'s ''Up Close'') to remove his display unless it was listed as belonging to the Baltimore Colts. The Hall of Fame has never complied with the request. Unitas donated his Colts memorabilia to the Babe Ruth Museum in Baltimore; they are now on display in the [[Sports Legends Museum at Camden Yards]].\n\nUnitas was inducted into the American Football Association's Semi Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.americanfootballassn.com/forms/2010HallofFameListing.pdf |title=Hall of Fame listing |website=www.americanfootballassn.com|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nUnitas actively lobbied for another NFL team to come to Baltimore. After the [[Cleveland Browns]] moved to Baltimore in 1996 and changed their name to the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]], Unitas and some of the other old-time Colts attended the Ravens' first game ever against the Raiders on Opening Day at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]]. Unitas was frequently seen on the Ravens' sidelines at home games<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-04-17/sports/0004170068_1_chris-redman-savage-ravens|title=Fallen QB Redman provides uplifting moment for Ravens|last=Rosenthal|first=Ken|publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=2000-04-17|accessdate=2014-09-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2002-09-13/sports/25361625_1_johnny-unitas-memorial-stadium-psinet-stadium-ravens-stadium|title=Ravens, others plan Unitas tributes|publisher=Philly.com|date=2002-09-13|accessdate=2014-09-11}}</ref> (most prominently in 1998 when the now-Indianapolis Colts played the Ravens) and received a thunderous ovation every time he was pictured on each of the huge widescreens at [[M&T Bank Stadium]]. He was often seen on the 30-yard line on the Ravens side. When the NFL celebrated its first 50 years, Unitas was voted the league's best player. Retired Bears quarterback [[Sid Luckman]] said of Unitas, \"He was better than me, better than [[Sammy Baugh]], better than anyone.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016574.html|title=Unitas surprised them all|last=Carter|first=Bob|publisher=espn.com|accessdate=2014-09-11}}</ref>\n\nUnitas lived most of the final years of his life severely hobbled. Due to an elbow injury suffered during his playing career, he had only very limited use of his right hand, and could not perform any physical activity more strenuous than golf due to his artificial knees.<ref name=\"Nack\">Nack, William.

He moved to the United States after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He entered the [[fur trade]] and built a [[monopoly]], managing a business empire that extended to the [[Great Lakes]] region and [[Canada]], and later expanded into the American West and [[Pacific]] coast. Seeing the decline of demand, he got out of the fur trade in 1830, diversifying by investing in [[New York City]] real estate and later becoming a famed patron of the arts.<ref>Axel Madsen, ''John Jacob Astor: America's First Multimillionaire'' (2001)</ref>\n\nHe was the first prominent member of the [[Astor family]] and the first multi-[[millionaire]] in the United States.\n\n{{anchor|Life|History}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nJohann Jakob Astor was born in [[Walldorf]] near [[Heidelberg]] in the [[Electoral Palatinate]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}{{sfnp|''BDNA''|1904}} He was the youngest son of Johann Jacob Astor and Maria Magdalena vom Berg.

An American merchant|year=1905}}</ref>\n\n===Fortune from fur trade===\nAstor took advantage of the [[Jay Treaty]] between Great Britain and the United States in 1794, which opened new markets in [[Canada]] and the [[Great Lakes]] region. In London, Astor at once made a contract with the [[North West Company]], who from Montreal rivaled the trade interests of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], then based in London. \nAstor imported furs from [[Montreal]] to New York and shipped them to [[Europe]].<ref name=\"americana\">{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Astor, John Jacob (merchant)|display=Astor, John Jacob, American merchant}}</ref> By 1800, he had amassed almost a quarter of a million dollars, and had become one of the leading figures in the fur trade. His agents worked throughout the western areas and were ruthless in competition. In 1800, following the example of the ''[[Empress of China (1783)|Empress of China]]'', the first American trading vessel to [[China]], Astor traded furs, teas, and [[sandalwood]] with [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in China, and greatly benefited from it.<ref name=\"auto\">Madsen, ''John Jacob Astor''  (2001)</ref>\n\nThe U.S. [[Embargo Act of 1807|Embargo Act]] in 1807, however, disrupted Astor's import/export business because it closed off trade with Canada. With the permission of President [[Thomas Jefferson]], Astor established the [[American Fur Company]] on April 6, 1808. He later formed subsidiaries: the [[Pacific Fur Company]], and the Southwest Fur Company (in which Canadians had a part), in order to control fur trading in the Great Lakes areas and [[Columbia River]] region. His Columbia River trading post at [[Fort Astoria]] (established in April 1811) was the first United States community on the Pacific coast. He financed the overland [[Astor Expedition]] in 1810\u201312 to reach the outpost. Members of the expedition were to discover [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]], through which hundreds of thousands of settlers on the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], [[Mormon Trail|Mormon]], and [[California Trail|California]] trails passed through the [[Rocky Mountains]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAstor's fur trading ventures were disrupted during the [[War of 1812]], when the British captured his trading posts. In 1816, he joined the opium-smuggling trade. His American Fur Company purchased ten tons of Turkish opium, then shipped the contraband item to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] on the packet ship ''Macedonian''. Astor later left the [[History of opium in China|China opium trade]] and sold solely to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/heroin/etc/history.html|title=The Opium Kings: Opium Throughout History|work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]|publisher=PBS|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAstor's business rebounded in 1817 after the U.S. Congress passed a [[Protectionism|protectionist]] law that barred foreign fur traders from U.S. territories. The American Fur Company came to dominate trading in the area around the Great Lakes. John Jacob Astor had a townhouse at 233 Broadway in Manhattan and a country estate, Hellgate in Northern New York City. In 1822, Astor established the [[Robert Stuart House]] on [[Mackinac Island]] as headquarters for the reorganized American Fur Company, making the island a metropolis of the fur trade. A lengthy description based on documents, diaries, etc. was given by [[Washington Irving]] in his travelogue ''[[Astoria (book)|Astoria]]''. Astor's commercial connections extended over the entire globe, and his ships were found in every sea. And he and Sarah moved to a townhouse on Prince Street in Manhattan, New York.<ref name=\"nie\"/>\n\n===Real estate and retirement===\nAstor began buying land in New York in 1799 and acquired sizable holdings along the waterfront. After the start of the 19th century, flush with [[Old China Trade|China trade]] profits, he became more systematic, ambitious, and calculating by investing in New York real estate. In 1803, he bought a 70-acre farm that ran west of Broadway to the Hudson River between 42nd and 46th streets. That same year, and the following year, he bought considerable holdings from the disgraced [[Aaron Burr]].<ref>Burrows, Edwin G.; Wallace, Mike (1998). ''Gotham A History of New York City to 1898''. Oxford University Press. p. 337. {{ISBN|978-0-19-511634-2}}</ref>\n \nIn the 1830s, Astor foresaw that the next big boom would be the build-up of New York, which would soon emerge as one of the world's greatest cities. Astor withdrew from the American Fur Company, as well as all his other ventures, and used the money to buy and develop large tracts of [[Manhattan]] real estate. Astor correctly predicted New York's rapid growth northward on [[Manhattan Island]], and he purchased more and more land beyond the then-existing [[city limits]]. Astor rarely built on his land, but leased it to others for rent and their use. After retiring from his business, Astor spent the rest of his life as a patron of culture. He supported the [[ornithologist]] [[John James Audubon]] in his studies, art work, and travels, and the presidential campaign of [[Henry Clay]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Marriage and family==\nOn September 19, 1785, Astor married Sarah Cox Todd, who died in 1834. Her parents were Scottish immigrants Adam Todd and Sarah Cox.<ref>Herbert C. Ebeling.

He also left $50,000 for a [[poorhouse]] and orphanage in his German hometown of [[Walldorf]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The ''Astorhaus'' is now operated as a museum honoring Astor and serves as a renowned fest hall for marriages. Astor donated gifts totaling $20,000 to the German Society of the City of New York, during his term as president, from 1837 until 1841.<ref>Wust, Klaus (1984).

Astor left enough money to care for John Jr. for the rest of his life. Astor is buried in [[Trinity Church Cemetery]] in [[Manhattan]], New York.

It was the predominant calendar in the Roman world, most of Europe, and in European settlements in the Americas and elsewhere, until it was refined and [[adoption of the Gregorian calendar|gradually replaced]] by the [[Gregorian calendar]], promulgated in 1582 by [[Pope Gregory XIII]].\n\nThe Julian calendar is still used in parts of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], in parts of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and by the [[Berbers]] (see below).\n\nDuring the 20th and 21st centuries, the date according to the Julian calendar is 13 days behind the Gregorian date, and after 2100 the disparity will widen.\n\n==Year length; leap years==\nThe Julian calendar has two types of [[year]]: \"normal\" years of 365 days and [[leap year|\"leap\" years]] of 366 days. There is a simple cycle of three \"normal\" years followed by a leap year and this pattern repeats forever without exception. The Julian year is, therefore, on average 365.25 days long. Consequently the Julian year drifts over time with respect to the [[tropical year|tropical (solar) year]] (365.24217 days).<ref name=Richards>Using value from Richards (2013, p. 587) for tropical year in mean solar days, the calculation is {{nowrap|1/(365.2425-365.24217)}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Greek astronomers had known, at least since [[Hipparchus]],<ref>[[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]], tr. [[G. J. Toomer]], ''[[Almagest|Ptolemy's Almagest]]'', 1998, Princeton University Press, p. 139. Hipparchus stated that the \"solar year ... contains 365 days, plus a fraction which is less than {{sfrac|1|4}} by about {{sfrac|1|300}}th of the sum of one day and night\".</ref> a century before the Julian reform, that the tropical year was slightly shorter than 365.25 days, the calendar did not compensate for this difference. As a result, the calendar year gains about three days every four centuries compared to observed [[equinox]] times and the seasons. This discrepancy was largely corrected by the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian reform]] of 1582. The Gregorian calendar has the same months and month lengths as the Julian calendar, but, in the Gregorian calendar, year numbers evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years, except that those evenly divisible by 400 remain leap years.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php Introduction to Calendars]. (15 May 2013). [[United States Naval Observatory]].</ref> (Even then, the Gregorian calendar diverges from astronomical observations by one day in 3,030 years).<ref name=Richards />\n\nThe difference in the average length of the year between Julian (365.25 days) and Gregorian (365.2425 days) is 0.002%, making the Julian 10.8 minutes longer. The accumulated effect of this difference over some 1600 years since the basis for [[Computus|calculation of the date of Easter]] was [[First Council of Nicea#Separation of Easter computation from Jewish calendar|determined at the First Council of Nicea]] means for example that, from 16 February ''Julian'' (1 March ''Gregorian'') 1900 and until 15 February ''Julian'' (28 February ''Gregorian'') 2100, ''Julian'' is 13 days behind ''Gregorian''. (Bearing in mind that 1900 and 2100 are leap years in the Julian system but not in the Gregorian).\n\n==Table of months==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

In addition, a 27- or 28-day [[intercalary month]], the [[Mercedonius|Mensis Intercalaris]], was sometimes inserted between February and March. This intercalary month was formed by inserting 22 or 23 days after the first 23 days of February; the last five days of February, which counted down toward the start of March, became the last five days of Intercalaris. The net effect was to add 22 or 23 days to the year, forming an intercalary year of 377 or 378 days.<ref>T H Key, \"A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities\" (article ''Calendarium''), London, 1875, available at [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html].</ref> Some say the ''mensis intercalaris'' always had 27 days and began on either the first or the second day after the Terminalia (23 February).<ref>Blackburn, B & Holford-Strevens, L ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'', Oxford University Press, 1999, reprinted with corrections, 2003, pp. 669\u201370.</ref>\n\nAccording to the later writers [[Censorinus]] and [[Macrobius]], the ideal intercalary cycle consisted of ordinary years of 355 days alternating with intercalary years, alternately 377 and 378 days long. In this system, the average Roman year would have had {{frac|366|1|4}} days over four years, giving it an average drift of one day per year relative to any [[solstice]] or equinox. Macrobius describes a further refinement whereby, in one 8-year period within a 24-year cycle, there were only three intercalary years, each of 377 days (thus 11 intercalary years out of 24). This refinement averages the length of the year to 365.25 days over 24 years.\n\nIn practice, intercalations did not occur systematically according to any of these ideal systems, but were determined by the [[Pontifex Maximus|pontifices]]. So far as can be determined from the historical evidence, they were much less regular than these ideal schemes suggest. They usually occurred every second or third year, but were sometimes omitted for much longer, and occasionally occurred in two consecutive years.\n\nIf managed correctly this system could have allowed the Roman year to stay roughly aligned to a tropical year. However, since the pontifices were often politicians, and because a Roman magistrate's term of [[official|office]] corresponded with a calendar year, this power was prone to abuse: a pontifex could lengthen a year in which he or one of his political allies was in office, or refuse to lengthen one in which his opponents were in power.<ref>Censorinus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Censorinus/text*.html#20.7 ''De die natali'' 20.7] (Latin)</ref>\n\nIf too many intercalations were omitted, as happened after the [[Second Punic War]] and during the [[Roman civil wars|Civil Wars]], the calendar would drift out of alignment with the tropical year. Moreover, because intercalations were often determined quite late, the average Roman citizen often did not know the date, particularly if he were some distance from the city. For these reasons, the last years of the pre-Julian calendar were later known as \"years of confusion\". The problems became particularly acute during the years of Julius Caesar's pontificate before the reform, 63\u201346&nbsp;BC, when there were only five intercalary months (instead of eight), none of which were during the five Roman years before 46&nbsp;BC.\n\nCaesar's reform was intended to solve this problem permanently, by creating a calendar that remained aligned to the sun without any human intervention. This proved useful very soon after the new calendar came into effect. [[Varro]] used it in 37&nbsp;BC to fix calendar dates for the start of the four seasons, which would have been impossible only 8 years earlier.<ref name=Varro>Varro, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/1*.html#28 ''On Agriculture'' I.1.28.]</ref> A century later, when [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] dated the [[winter solstice]] to 25 December because the sun entered the 8th degree of Capricorn on that date,<ref>Pliny, ''Natural History:'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D18%3Achapter%3D59 ''(Book 18, LIX / LXVI / LXVIII / LXXIV)''.]</ref> this stability had become an ordinary fact of life.\n\n== Context of the reform ==\nAlthough the approximation of {{frac|365|1|4}} days for the tropical year had been known for a long time<ref>{{cite journal|first=R. A.|last=Parker|title=Ancient Egyptian Astronomy|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences|volume=276|issue=1257|date=May 1974|pages=51\u201365|jstor=74274}}</ref> ancient [[solar calendar]]s had used less precise periods, resulting in gradual misalignment of the calendar with the seasons.\n\nThe [[octaeteris]], a cycle of 8 lunar years popularised by [[Cleostratus]] (and also commonly attributed to [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]]) which was used in some early Greek calendars, notably in [[Attic calendar|Athens]], is 1.53 days longer than eight Julian years. The length of nineteen years in the [[Metonic cycle|cycle of Meton]] was 6,940 days, six hours longer than the mean Julian year. The mean Julian year was the basis of the [[Callippic cycle|76-year cycle]] devised by [[Callippus]] (a student under Eudoxus) to improve the Metonic cycle.\n\nIn Persia (Iran) after the reform in the [[Iranian calendars#Old Persian calendar|Persian calendar]] by introduction of the Persian Zoroastrian (i. e. Young Avestan) calendar in 503&nbsp;BC and afterwards, the first day of the year (1 Farvardin=[[Nowruz]]) slipped against the vernal equinox at the rate of approximately one day every four years.<ref>Hartner, Willy. \"The young Avestan and Babylonian calendars and the antecedents of precession.\" Journal for the History of Astronomy 10 (1979): 1. pp.&nbsp;1\u201322.

Oxford University Press, 2012., p. 178.</ref>\n\nLikewise in the [[Egyptian calendar]], a fixed year of 365 days was in use, drifting by one day against the sun in four years. An unsuccessful attempt to add an extra day every fourth year was made in 238&nbsp;BC ([[Decree of Canopus]]). Caesar probably experienced this \"wandering\" or \"vague\" calendar in that country. He landed in the Nile delta in October 48&nbsp;BC and soon became embroiled in the Ptolemaic dynastic war, especially after [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] managed to be \"introduced\" to him in [[Alexandria]].\n\nCaesar imposed a peace, and a banquet was held to celebrate the event.<ref name=\"Book 10\">Lucan, ''[[Pharsalia]]:'' [http://omacl.org/Pharsalia/book10.html ''Book 10''.]</ref> [[Lucan]] depicted Caesar talking to a wise man called [[Acoreus]] during the feast, stating his intention to create a calendar more perfect than that of Eudoxus<ref name=\"Book 10\" /> (Eudoxus was popularly credited with having determined the length of the year to be {{frac|365|1|4}} days).<ref>\u00c9mile Bi\u00e9mont, ''Rythmes du temps, astronomie et calendriers'', \u00e9d. De Boeck (Bruxelles), 2000 ({{ISBN|2-8041-3287-0}}), p. 224.</ref> But the war soon resumed and Caesar was attacked by the Egyptian army for several months until he achieved victory. He then enjoyed a long cruise on the Nile with Cleopatra before leaving the country in June 47&nbsp;BC.<ref>Suetonius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#52 ''Caesar'' 52.1.]</ref>\n\nCaesar returned to Rome in 46&nbsp;BC and, according to [[Plutarch]], called in the best philosophers and mathematicians of his time to solve the problem of the calendar.<ref>Plutarch, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#59 ''Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans'': Caesar 59].</ref> Pliny says that Caesar was aided in his reform by the astronomer [[Sosigenes of Alexandria]]<ref>Pliny, ''Natural History:'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D18%3Achapter%3D57 ''(Book 18, LVII)''.]</ref> who is generally considered the principal designer of the reform. Sosigenes may also have been the author of the astronomical almanac published by Caesar to facilitate the reform.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/555018/Sosigenes-of-Alexandria Sosigenes of Alexandria].</ref> Eventually, it was decided to establish a calendar that would be a combination between the old Roman months, the fixed length of the Egyptian calendar, and the {{frac|365|1|4}} days of the Greek astronomy. According to Macrobius, Caesar was assisted in this by a certain Marcus Flavius.<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.2 ''Saturnalia'' I.14.2] (Latin).</ref>\n\n== Julian reform ==\n\n=== Realignment of the year ===\nThe first step of the reform was to realign the start of the calendar year (1 January) to the tropical year by making 46&nbsp;BC (708 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]]) 445 days long, compensating for the intercalations which had been missed during Caesar's pontificate. This year had already been extended from 355 to 378 days by the insertion of a regular [[intercalary month]] in February. When Caesar decreed the reform, probably shortly after his return from the [[Battle of Thapsus|African campaign]] in late Quintilis (July), he added 67 more days by inserting two extraordinary intercalary months between November and December.<ref group=note>It is not known why he decided that 67 was the correct number of days to add, nor whether he intended to align the calendar to a specific astronomical event such as the winter solstice. [[Ideler]] suggested (''Handbuch der mathematischen und technischen Chronologie'' II 123\u2013125) that he intended to align the winter solstice to a supposedly traditional date of 25 December. The number may compensate for three omitted intercalary months (67 = 22+23+22). It also made the distance from 1 March 46&nbsp;BC, the original New Years Day in the Roman calendar, to 1 January 45&nbsp;BC 365 days.</ref>\n\nThese months are called ''Intercalaris Prior'' and ''Intercalaris Posterior'' in letters of [[Cicero]] written at the time; there is no basis for the statement sometimes seen that they were called \"[[Undecimber]]\" and \"[[Duodecember|Duodecimber]]\", terms that arose in the 18th century over a millennium after the Roman Empire's collapse.<ref group=note>E.g., \"... we have a sidelight on what was involved in \"the year of confusion\" as it was called. According to Dion Cassius, the historian, there was a governor in Gaul who insisted that, in the lengthened year, two months' extra taxes should be paid. The extra months were called Undecimber and Duodecimber.\" (P. W. Wilson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9xcbAAAAYAAJ&q=undecimber+duodecimber ''The romance of the calendar''] (New York, 1937), 112). The eponymous dating of the cited passage ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#21 Dio Cassius 54.21]) shows that it actually refers to an event of 15&nbsp;BC, not 46&nbsp;BC.</ref> Their individual lengths are unknown, as is the position of the [[Nones (calendar)|Nones]] and [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]] within them.<ref>J. R\u00fcpke, ''The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine: Time, History and the Fasti'', 117f., suggests, based on the ritual structures of the calendar, that 5 days were added to November and that the two intercalary months each had 31 days, with Nones and Ides on the 7th and 15th.</ref>\n\nBecause 46&nbsp;BC was the last of a series of irregular years, this extra-long year was, and is, referred to as the \"last year of confusion\". The new calendar began operation after the realignment had been completed, in 45&nbsp;BC.<ref>[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]:'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html#p231 Year of Julius Caesar]), following [[Ideler]], interprets Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.13 ''Saturnalia'' 1.14.13] (Latin) to mean that Caesar decreed that the first day of the new calendar began with the new moon which fell on the night of 1/2 January 45&nbsp;BC. (The new moon was on 2 January 45&nbsp;BC (in the [[Proleptic Julian calendar]]) at 00:21 UTC, according to [[Institut de m\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste et de calcul des \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e9rides|IMCCE]] (a branch of the [[Paris Observatory]]): [http://bugle.imcce.fr/en/grandpublic/phenomenes/phases_lune/index.php ''Phases of the moon (between \u22124000 and +2500)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720232543/http://bugle.imcce.fr/en/grandpublic/phenomenes/phases_lune/index.php |date=2011-07-20 }}.) However, more recent studies of the manuscripts have shown that the word on which this is based, which was read as ''lunam'', should be read as ''linam'', meaning that Macrobius was simply stating that Caesar published an edict giving the revised calendar \u2013 see e.g., p.99 in the translation of Macrobius by P. Davies. Smith gives no source or justification for his other speculation that Caesar originally intended to commence the year precisely with the winter solstice.</ref>\n\n=== Changes to the months ===\n\nThe Julian months were formed by adding ten days to a regular pre-Julian Roman year of 355 days, creating a regular Julian year of 365 days. Two extra days were added to January, Sextilis (August) and December, and one extra day was added to April, June, September and November. February was not changed in ordinary years, and so continued to be the traditional 28 days. Thus, the ordinary (i.e., non-leap year) lengths of all of the months were set by the Julian calendar to the same values they still hold today. (See [[Julian calendar#Sacrobosco's theory on month lengths|Sacrobosco's theory on month lengths]] below for stories purporting otherwise.)\n\nThe Julian reform did not change [[Roman calendar#Months|the method used to account days of the month in the pre-Julian calendar]], based on the Kalends, Nones and Ides, nor did it change the positions of these three dates within the months. Macrobius states that the extra days were added immediately before the last day of each month to avoid disturbing the position of the established religious ceremonies relative to the Nones and Ides of the month.<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.9 ''Saturnalia'' 1.14.9] (Latin). Exceptionally, the extra day in April was inserted as the 26th, a.d. VI Kal. Mai. in the Julian calendar, in order to avoid adding a day to the [[Floralia]], which ran from a.d. IV Kal. Mai. (27 April in the pre-Julian calendar) to a.d. V Non. Mai.</ref> However, since Roman dates after the Ides of the month counted down toward the start of the next month, the extra days had the effect of raising the initial value of the count of the day following the Ides in the lengthened months. Thus, in January, Sextilis and December the 14th day of the month became a.d. XIX Kal. instead of a.d. XVII Kal., while in April, June, September and November it became a.d. XVIII Kal.\n\nRomans of the time born after the Ides of a month responded differently to the effect of this change on their birthdays. [[Mark Antony]] kept his birthday on 14 January, which changed its date from a.d. XVII Kal. Feb to a.d. XIX Kal. Feb, a date that had previously not existed. [[Livia]] kept the date of her birthday unchanged at a.d. III Kal. Feb., which moved it from 28 to 30 January, a day that had previously not existed. [[Augustus]] kept his on 23 September, but both the old date (a.d. VIII Kal. Oct.) and the new (a.d. IX Kal. Oct.) were celebrated in some places.\n\nThe inserted days were all initially characterised as ''dies fasti'' ('''F''' \u2013 see [[Roman calendar#Character of the day|Roman calendar]]).<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.12 ''Saturnalia'' 1.14.12] (Latin).</ref> The character of a few festival days was changed. In the early Julio-Claudian period a large number of festivals were decreed to celebrate events of dynastic importance, which caused the character of the associated dates to be changed to '''NP'''. However, this practice was discontinued around the reign of [[Claudius]], and the practice of characterising days fell into disuse around the end of the first century AD: the Antonine jurist [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] speaks of ''dies nefasti'' as a thing of the past.<ref>A. K. Michels, ''The Calendar of the Roman Republic'' Appendix II; J. R\u00fcpke, ''The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine'' 113\u2013114, 126\u2013132, 147.</ref>\n\n=== Intercalation ===\nThe old intercalary month was abolished. The new leap day was dated as ''ante diem bis sextum Kalendas Martias'' ('the sixth doubled day before the Kalends of March'), usually abbreviated as ''a.d. bis VI Kal. Mart.''; hence it is called in English the [[bissextile]] day. The year in which it occurred was termed ''annus bissextus'', in English the bissextile year.\n\nThere is debate about the exact position of the bissextile day in the early Julian calendar. The earliest direct evidence is a statement of the 2nd century jurist [[Publius Iuventius Celsus|Celsus]], who states that there were two halves of a 48-hour day, and that the intercalated day was the \"posterior\" half. An inscription from AD 168 states that ''a.d. V Kal. Mart.'' was the day after the bissextile day. The 19th century chronologist [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]] argued that Celsus used the term \"posterior\" in a technical fashion to refer to the earlier of the two days, which requires the inscription to refer to the whole 48-hour day as the bissextile. Some later historians share this view. Others, following [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], take the view that Celsus was using the ordinary Latin (and English) meaning of \"posterior\". A third view is that neither half of the 48-hour \"bis sextum\" was originally formally designated as intercalated, but that the need to do so arose as the concept of a 48-hour day became obsolete.<ref>W. Sternkopf, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=MmPMaTG2ukYC&pg=PA718 Das Bissextum]\", (JCP 41 (1895) 718\u2013733).</ref>\n\nThere is no doubt that the bissextile day eventually became the earlier of the two days for most purposes. In 238 Censorinus stated that it was inserted after the [[Terminus (god)|Terminalia]] (23 February) and was followed by the last five days of February, i.e., a.d. VI, V, IV, III and prid. Kal. Mart. (which would be 24 to 28 February in a common year and the 25th to 29th in a leap year). Hence he regarded the bissextum as the first half of the doubled day. All later writers, including Macrobius about 430, [[Bede]] in 725, and other medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of Easter) followed this rule, as does the [[liturgical year|liturgical calendar]] of the Roman Catholic Church. However, Celsus' definition continued to be used for legal purposes. It was incorporated into [[Digest (Roman law)|Justinian's Digest]],<ref>Justinian, [http://webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Anglica/D50_Scott.htm#XVI Digest 50.16.98].</ref> and in the English statute ''De anno et die bissextili'' of 1236,<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKZFAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA20 |chapter=The statute ''De anno et die bissextili'', made at Westminster, Anno 21 Hen.

According to Dio Cassius, a leap day was inserted in 41&nbsp;BC to ensure that the first market day of 40&nbsp;BC did not fall on 1 January, which implies that the old 8-day cycle was not immediately affected by the Julian reform. However, he also reports that in AD 44, and on some previous occasions, the market day was changed to avoid a conflict with a religious festival. This may indicate that a single nundinal letter was assigned to both halves of the 48-hour bissextile day by this time, so that the [[Regifugium]] and the market day might fall on the same date but on different days. In any case, the 8-day nundinal cycle began to be displaced by the 7-day [[Seven-day week|week]] in the first century AD, and [[dominical letter]]s began to appear alongside nundinal letters in the fasti.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/48*.html#33.4 Dio Cassius 48.33.4], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#24.7 60.24.7]; C.

Consequently, the leap day was considered to be the last day in February in leap years, i.e., 29 February, which is its current position.\n\n=== Sacrobosco's theory on month lengths ===\nThe Julian reform set the lengths of the months to their modern values. However, a 13th-century scholar, [[Sacrobosco]], proposed a different explanation for the lengths of Julian months<ref>Roscoe Lamont, \"[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1919PA.....27..579P/0000583.000.html The Roman calendar and its reformation by Julius Caesar]\", ''[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]]'' '''27''' (1919) 583\u2013595. Sacrobosco's theory is discussed on pages 585\u2013587.</ref> which is still widely repeated but is certainly wrong.\n\nAccording to Sacrobosco, the month lengths for ordinary years in the Roman Republican calendar, from January to December, were:\n\n:30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29.\n\nSacrobosco then thought that Julius Caesar added one day to every month except February, a total of 11 more days to regular months, giving the ordinary Julian year of 365 days. A single leap day could now be added to this extra short February:\n\n:31, 29/30, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 30.\n\nHe then said Augustus changed this, by taking one day from February to add it to Sextilis, and then modifying the alternation of the following months, to:\n\n:31, 28/29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31\n\nso that the length of ''Augustus'' (August) would not be shorter than (and therefore inferior to) the length of ''Iulius'' (July), giving us the irregular month lengths which are still in use.\n\nThere is abundant evidence disproving this theory. First, a wall painting of a Roman calendar predating the Julian reform has survived,<ref>[[:File:Roman-calendar.png|Roman Republican calendar.]]</ref> which confirms the literary accounts that the months were already irregular before Julius Caesar reformed them, with an ordinary year of 355 days, not 354, with month lengths arranged as:\n\n:29, 28, 31, 29, 31, 29, 31, 29, 29, 31, 29, 29.\n\nAlso, the Julian reform did not change the dates of the [[Nones (calendar)|Nones]] and [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]]. In particular, the Ides were late (on the 15th rather than 13th) in March, May, July and October, showing that these months always had 31 days in the Roman calendar,<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#13.7 ''Saturnalia'' 1.13.7] and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.7 1.14.7\u20138] (Latin), Censorinus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Censorinus/text*.html#20.10 ''De die natali'' 20.10] (Latin), [http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Maude/Censorinus/DeDieNatale-Part2.html#chap9 (English)].</ref> whereas Sacrobosco's theory requires that March, May and July were originally 30 days long and that the length of October was changed from 29 to 30 days by Caesar and to 31 days by Augustus. Further, Sacrobosco's theory is explicitly contradicted by the 3rd and 5th century authors Censorinus<ref>Censorinus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Censorinus/text*.html#20.9 ''De die natali'' 20.9] (Latin), [http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Maude/Censorinus/DeDieNatale-Part2.html#chap9 (English)]</ref> and Macrobius,<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.7 ''Saturnalia'' 1.14.7] (Latin)</ref> and it is inconsistent with seasonal lengths given by Varro, writing in 37&nbsp;BC,<ref name=Varro /> before Sextilis was [[Julian calendar#Month names|renamed]] for Augustus in 8&nbsp;BC, with the 31-day Sextilis given by an Egyptian papyrus from 24&nbsp;BC,<ref name=papyrus /> and with the 28-day February shown in the ''Fasti Caeretani'', which is dated before 12&nbsp;BC.<ref>A. Degrassi, ''Inscriptiones Italiae XIII: Fasti et Elogia 2: Fasti Anni Numani et Iuliani; Accedunt Feralia, Menologia Rustica, Parapegmata'' (Rome, 1963) 66 (Latin)</ref>\n\n=== Adoption of the Julian calendar ===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nCaesar's reform only applied to the [[Roman calendar]]. However, in the following decades many of the local civic and provincial calendars of the empire and neighbouring client kingdoms were aligned to the Julian calendar by transforming them into calendars with years of 365 days with an extra day intercalated every four years.<ref>This section is based on S. Stern, ''Calendars in Antiquity'' (OUP 2012) pp. 259\u2013297.</ref> The reformed calendars typically retained many features of the unreformed calendars. In many cases, the New Year was not on 1 January, the leap day was not on the bissextile day, the old month names were retained, the lengths of the reformed months did not match the lengths of Julian months, and, even if they did, their first days did not match the first day of the corresponding Julian month. Nevertheless, since the reformed calendars had fixed relationships to each other and to the Julian calendar, the process of converting dates between them became quite straightforward, through the use of conversion tables known as ''hemerologia''.<ref>Studied in detail in W. Kubitschek, ''Die Kalendarb\u00fccher von Florenz, Rom und Leyden'' (Vienna, 1915).</ref> Several of the reformed calendars are only known through surviving hemerologia.\n\nThe three most important of these calendars are the Alexandrian calendar, the Asian calendar and the Syro-Macedonian calendar. Other reformed calendars are known from Cappadocia, Cyprus and the cities of Syria and Palestine. Most reformed calendars were adopted under Augustus, though the calendar of [[Nabatea]] was reformed after the kingdom became the Roman province of Arabia in AD 106. There is no evidence that local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar in the western empire. Unreformed calendars continued to be used in [[Coligny calendar|Gaul]], Greece, Macedon, the Balkans and parts of Palestine, most notably in Judea.\n\nThe Alexandrian calendar adapted the Egyptian calendar by adding a 6th epagomenal day as the last day of the year in every fourth year, falling on 29 August preceding a Julian bissextile day. It was otherwise identical to the Egyptian calendar. The first leap day was in 22&nbsp;BC, and they occurred every four years from the beginning, even though Roman leap days occurred every three years at this time (see [[Julian calendar#Leap year error|Leap year error]]). This calendar influenced the structure of several other reformed calendars, such as those of the cities of Gaza and Ascalon in Palestine, Salamis in Cyprus, and the province of Arabia. It was adopted by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic church]] and remains in use both as the liturgical calendar of the Coptic church and as the civil calendar of [[Ethiopia]].\n\nThe Asian calendar was an adaptation of the [[Ancient Macedonian calendar|Macedonian calendar]] used in the province of Asia and, with minor variations, in nearby cities and provinces. It is known in detail through the survival of decrees promulgating it issued in 8 BC by the proconsul [[Paullus Fabius Maximus]]. It renamed the first month Dios as ''Kaisar'', and arranged the months such that each month started on the ninth day before the kalends of the corresponding Roman month; thus the year began on 23 September, Augustus' birthday. Since Greek months typically had 29 or 30 days, the extra day of 31-day months was named ''Sebaste''\u2014the emperor's day\u2014and was the first day of these months. The leap day was a second Sebaste day in the month of Xandikos, i.e., 24 February. This calendar remained in use at least until the middle of the fifth century AD.\n\nThe Syro-Macedonian calendar was an adaptation of the Macedonian calendar used in Antioch and other parts of Syria. The months were exactly aligned to the Julian calendar, but they retained their Macedonian names and the year began in Dios = November until the fifth century, when the start of the year was moved to Gorpiaios = September.\n\nThese reformed calendars generally remained in use until the fifth or sixth century. Around that time most of them were replaced as civil calendars by the Julian calendar, but with a year starting in September to reflect the year of the [[indiction]] cycle.\n\nThe Julian calendar spread beyond the borders of the Roman Empire through its use as the Christian liturgical calendar. When a people or a country was converted to Christianity, they generally also adopted the Christian calendar of the church responsible for conversion. Thus, Christian Nubia and Ethiopia adopted the Alexandrian calendar, while Christian Europe adopted the Julian calendar, in either the Catholic or Orthodox variant. Starting in the 16th century, European settlements in the Americas and elsewhere likewise inherited the Julian calendar of the mother country, until they adopted the Gregorian reform. The last country to adopt the Julian calendar was the Ottoman Empire, which used it for financial purposes for some time under the name [[Rumi calendar]] and dropped the \"escape years\" which tied it to Muslim chronology in 1840.\n\n== Leap year error ==\n<!-- Linked from Roman calendar: Later reforms -->\nAlthough the new calendar was much simpler than the pre-Julian calendar, the pontifices initially added a leap day every three years, instead of every four.

But when this error was at length recognised, it too was corrected, by an order of Augustus, that twelve years should be allowed to pass without an intercalary day, since the sequence of twelve such years would account for the three days which, in the course of thirty-six years, had been introduced by the premature actions of the priests.</blockquote>\n\nSo, according to Macrobius,\n# the year was considered to begin after the Terminalia, (23 February)<ref>Marcus Terentius Varro, ''On the Latin Language'', 6.13, tr. Roland Kent, London 1938 available at [https://ryanfb.github.io/loebolus-data/L333.pdf].</ref>\n# the calendar was operated correctly from its introduction on 1 January 45&nbsp;BC until the beginning of the fourth year (February 42&nbsp;BC) at which point the priests inserted the first intercalation,\n# Caesar's intention was to make the first intercalation at the beginning of the fifth year (February 41&nbsp;BC),\n# the priests made a further eleven intercalations after 42&nbsp;BC at three-year intervals so that the twelfth intercalation fell in 9&nbsp;BC,\n# had Caesar's intention been followed there would have been intercalations every four years after 41&nbsp;BC, so that the ninth intercalation would have been in 9&nbsp;BC,\n# after 9&nbsp;BC, there were twelve years without [[leap year]]s, so that the leap days Caesar would have had in 5&nbsp;BC, 1&nbsp;BC and AD&nbsp;4 were omitted and\n# after AD&nbsp;4 the calendar was operated as Caesar intended, so that the next leap year was AD&nbsp;8 and then leap years followed every fourth year thereafter.<ref>Nautical Almanac Offices of the United Kingdom and the United States.

The above scheme is that of Scaliger in the table below. He established that the Augustan reform was instituted in 8&nbsp;BC. The table shows for each reconstruction the implied proleptic Julian date for the first day of Caesar's reformed calendar (Kal. Ian. AUC 709) and the first Julian date on which the Roman calendar date matches the Julian calendar after the completion of Augustus' reform.\n\nAlexander Jones claims that the correct Julian calendar was in use in Egypt in 24&nbsp;BC,<ref name=\"papyrus\" /> implying that the first day of the reform in both Egypt and Rome, {{nowrap|1 January 45 BC}}, was the Julian date 1&nbsp;January if 45&nbsp;BC was a leap year and 2&nbsp;January if it was not.

Thus Xanthicus began on a.d. IX Kal. Mart., and normally contained 31 days. In leap year, however, it contained an extra \"Sebaste day\", the Roman leap day, and thus had 32 days. From the lunar nature of the old calendar we can fix the starting date of the new one as 24&nbsp;January, {{nowrap|a.d. IX Kal. Feb 5 BC}} in the Julian calendar, which was a leap year.

Laffi, \"Le iscrizioni relative all'introduzione nel 9 a.c. del nuovo calendario della provincia d'Asia\", Studi Classici e Orientali 16 (1967) 5\u201399.</ref> is\n\n<blockquote>\nIntercalation shall commence on the day after the fourteenth day in the current month of Peritius [a.d. IX Kal. Feb], occurring every third year. Xanthicus shall have 32 days in this intercalary year.\n</blockquote>\n\nThis would move the starting date back three years to 8&nbsp;BC, and from the lunar synchronism back to 26 January (Julian). But since the corresponding Roman date in the inscription is 24 January, this must be according to the incorrect calendar which in 8&nbsp;BC Augustus had ordered to be corrected by the omission of leap days. As the authors of the previous paper point out, with the correct four-year cycle being used in Egypt and the three-year cycle abolished in Rome it is unlikely that Augustus would have ordered the three-year cycle to be introduced in Asia.\n\n==Month names==\nThe Julian reform did not immediately cause the names of any months to be changed. The old [[Mercedonius|intercalary month]] was abolished and replaced with a single intercalary day at the same point (i.e., five days before the end of February). January continued to be the first month of the year.\n\nThe Romans later renamed months after Julius Caesar and Augustus, renaming Quintilis as \"Iulius\" (July)<ref name=J /> in 44&nbsp;BC and Sextilis as \"Augustus\" (August) in 8&nbsp;BC. Quintilis was renamed to honour Caesar because it was the month of his birth.<ref>Suetonius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#76 ''Caesar''] 76.1.</ref> According to a ''[[senatus consultum]]'' quoted by Macrobius, Sextilis was renamed to honour Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, occurred in that month.<ref>Suetonius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#31.2 ''Augustus'' 31.2]; Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#12.35  ''Saturnalia'' 1.12.35] (Latin)</ref>\n\nOther months were renamed by other emperors, but apparently none of the later changes survived their deaths. In AD 37, [[Caligula]] renamed September as \"Germanicus\" after his [[Germanicus|father]];<ref>Suetonius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#15.2 ''Caligula'' 15.2].</ref> in AD 65, [[Nero]] renamed April as \"Neroneus\", May as \"Claudius\" and June as \"Germanicus\";<ref>Tacitus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/15C*.html#74 ''Annals'' 15.74], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/16*.html#12 16.12].</ref> and in AD 84 [[Domitian]] renamed September as \"Germanicus\" and October as \"Domitianus\".<ref>Suetonius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#13.3 ''Domitian'' 13.3].</ref> [[Commodus]] was unique in renaming all twelve months after his own adopted names (January to December): \"Amazonius\", \"Invictus\", \"Felix\", \"Pius\", \"Lucius\", \"Aelius\", \"Aurelius\", \"Commodus\", \"Augustus\", \"Herculeus\", \"Romanus\", and \"Exsuperatorius\".<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.html#72-15.3 Dio Cassius 73.15.3].</ref> The emperor [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus|Tacitus]] is said to have ordered that September, the month of his birth and accession, be renamed after him, but the story is doubtful since he did not become emperor before November 275.<ref>Historia Augusta, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Tacitus*.html#13.6 ''Tacitus'' 13.6].

[[Tiberius]] rejected a senatorial proposal to rename September as \"Tiberius\" and October as \"Livius\", after his mother Livia.<ref>Suetonius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#26.2 ''Tiberius'' 26.2].</ref> [[Antoninus Pius]] rejected a senatorial decree renaming September as \"Antoninus\" and November as \"Faustina\", after [[Faustina the Elder|his empress]].<ref>Historia Augusta, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Antoninus_Pius*.html#10 ''Antoninus Pius'' 10.1].</ref>\n\nMuch more lasting than the ephemeral month names of the post-Augustan Roman emperors were the [[Germanic calendar|Old High German names]] introduced by [[Charlemagne]]. According to his biographer, Charlemagne renamed all of the months agriculturally into German.<ref>Einhard, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/einhard.asp#Reforms ''Life of Charlemagne'', 29].</ref> These names were used until the 15th century, over 700 years after his rule, and continued, with some modifications, to see some use as \"traditional\" month names until the late 18th century. The names (January to December) were: ''Wintarmanoth'' (\"winter month\"), ''Hornung'',<ref group=note>This name of February, the only name in the list without the \"month\" suffix, is explained by K\u00f6nig, ''Festschrift Bergmann'' (1997), pp. 425 ff. as a collective of ''[[:wikt:horn|horn]]'', taken to refer to the antlers shed by [[red deer]] during this time. Older explanations compare the name with Old Frisian ''horning'' (Anglo-Saxon ''hornung-sunu'', Old Norse ''hornungr'') meaning \"bastard, illegitimate son\", taken to imply a meaning of \"disinherited\" in reference to February being the shortest of months.</ref> ''Lentzinmanoth'' (\"spring month\", \"[[:wikt:Lent|Lent]] month\"), ''Ostarmanoth'' (\"[[:wikt:Easter|Easter]] month\"), ''Wonnemanoth'' (\"[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/wunj\u014d|joy]]-month\", a corruption of ''Winnimanoth'' \"pasture-month\"), ''Brachmanoth'' (\"[[:wikt:Brache|fallow]]-month\"), ''Heuuimanoth'' (\"hay month\"), ''Aranmanoth'' (\"[[:wikt:earnian|reaping]] month\"), ''Witumanoth'' (\"wood month\"), ''Windumemanoth'' (\"vintage month\"), ''Herbistmanoth'' (\"harvest month\"), and ''Heilagmanoth'' (\"holy month\").\n\nThe calendar month names used in western and northern Europe, in Byzantium, and by the [[Berber calendar#The months|Berbers]], were derived from the Latin names. However, in eastern Europe older seasonal month names continued to be used into the 19th century, and in some cases are still in use, in many languages, including: [[Belarusian months|Belarusian]], [[Bulgarian months|Bulgarian]], [[Croatian months|Croatian]], [[Czech months|Czech]], Finnish,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wordinfo.info/unit/3236/ip:23 |title=Calendar, Finnish |website=English-Word Information}}</ref> [[Georgian calendar|Georgian]], [[Lithuanian calendar#Names of the months|Lithuanian]], [[Macedonian months|Macedonian]], [[Polish months|Polish]], [[Romanian months|Romanian]], [[Slovene months|Slovene]], [[Ukrainian months|Ukrainian]]. When the Ottoman Empire adopted the Julian calendar, in the form of the Rumi calendar, the [[Rumi calendar#History|month names]] reflected Ottoman tradition.\n\n==Year numbering==\nThe principal method used by the Romans to identify a year for dating purposes was to name it after the two consuls who took office in it, the eponymous period in question being the consular year. Beginning in 153&nbsp;BC, consuls began to take office on 1 January, thus synchronizing the commencement of the consular and calendar years. The calendar year has begun in January and ended in December since about 450&nbsp;BC according to Ovid or since about 713&nbsp;BC according to Macrobius and Plutarch (see [[Roman calendar]]). Julius Caesar did not change the beginning of either the consular year or the calendar year. In addition to consular years, the Romans sometimes used the regnal year of the emperor, and by the late 4th century documents were also being dated according to the 15-year cycle of the [[indiction]]. In 537, [[Justinian I|Justinian]] required that henceforth the date must include the name of the emperor and his regnal year, in addition to the indiction and the consul, while also allowing the use of local [[Calendar era|eras]].\n\nIn 309 and 310, and from time to time thereafter, no consuls were appointed.<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronography_of_354_08_fasti.htm Chronography of AD 354.]</ref> When this happened, the consular date was given a count of years since the last consul (so-called \"post-consular\" dating). After 541, only the reigning emperor held the consulate, typically for only one year in his reign, and so post-consular dating became the norm. Similar post-consular dates were also known in the west in the early 6th century. <!-- Commented out pending further research. [[User:Dojarca]] is up to 4th year of the consulate of [[Justinian II]] with no assurance he is the latest. --~~~~ The last known post-consular date is year 22 after the consulate of [[Heraclius]].{{Verify source|date=August 2007}} The last emperor to hold the consulate was [[Constans II]]. --> The system of consular dating, long obsolete, was formally abolished in the law code of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]], issued in 888.\n\nOnly rarely did the Romans number the year from the [[founding of Rome|founding of the city (of Rome)]], ''[[ab urbe condita]]'' (AUC). This method was used by Roman historians to determine the number of years from one event to another, not to date a year. Different historians had several different dates for the founding. The ''[[Fasti]] Capitolini'', an inscription containing an official list of the consuls which was published by Augustus, used an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of 752&nbsp;BC. The epoch used by [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], 753&nbsp;BC, has been adopted by modern historians. Indeed, [[Renaissance]] editors often added it to the manuscripts that they published, giving the false impression that the Romans numbered their years. Most modern historians tacitly assume that it began on the day the consuls took office, and ancient documents such as the ''Fasti Capitolini'' which use other AUC systems do so in the same way. However, Censorinus, writing in the 3rd century AD, states that, in his time, the AUC year began with the [[Parilia]], celebrated on 21 April, which was regarded as the actual anniversary of the foundation of Rome.<ref>Censorinus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Censorinus/text*.html#21.6 ''De die natali'' 21.6] (Latin). Because the festivities associated with the Parilia conflicted with the solemnity of [[Lent]], which was observed until the Saturday before Easter Sunday, the early Roman church did not celebrate Easter after 21 April \u2013 Charles W. Jones, \"Development of the Latin Ecclesiastical calendar\", ''Bedae Opera de Temporibus'' (1943), 1\u2013122, p.28.</ref>\n\nMany local eras, such as the Era of Actium and the [[Spanish Era]], were adopted for the Julian calendar or its local equivalent in the provinces and cities of the Roman Empire. Some of these were used for a considerable time.<ref>For a partial survey see A. E. Samuel, ''Greek and Roman Chronology: calendars and years in classical antiquity'' (Munich, 1972), 245ff. Samuel introduces his survey by saying: \"The number of eras which came into use and then expired to be replaced by yet other eras during Hellenistic and Roman times is probably not infinite, but I have not been able to find the end of them.\" Anatolian eras are exhaustively surveyed in W. Leschhorn, ''Antike \u00c4ren: Zeitrechnung, Politik und Geschichte im Schwarzmeerraum und in Kleinasien n\u00f6rdlich des Tauros'' (Stuttgart, 1993).</ref> Perhaps the best known is the [[Era of Martyrs]], sometimes also called ''Anno Diocletiani'' (after [[Diocletian]]), which was associated with the Alexandrian calendar and often used by the [[Alexandria]]n Christians to number their Easters during the 4th and 5th centuries, and continues to be used by the Coptic and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian]] churches.\n\nIn the eastern Mediterranean, the efforts of Christian chronographers such as [[Annianus of Alexandria]] to date the Biblical creation of the world led to the introduction of [[Anno Mundi]] eras based on this event.<ref>A. A. Mosshammer, ''The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era'' (Oxford, 2008) 27\u201329.</ref> The most important of these was the [[Etos Kosmou]], used throughout the Byzantine world from the 10th century and in Russia until 1700. In the west, the kingdoms succeeding the empire initially used indictions and [[regnal year]]s, alone or in combination. The chronicler [[Prosper of Aquitaine]], in the fifth century, used an era dated from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], but this era was not widely adopted. [[Dionysius Exiguus]] proposed the system of [[Anno Domini]] in 525. This era gradually spread through the western Christian world, once the system was adopted by [[Bede]] in the eighth century.\n\nThe Julian calendar was also used in some Muslim countries. The Rumi calendar, the Julian calendar used in the later years of the [[Ottoman Empire]], adopted an era derived from the lunar [[Islamic calendar|AH]] year equivalent to AD 1840, i.e., the effective Rumi epoch was AD 585. In recent years, some users of the [[Berber calendar#The computation of the years|Berber calendar]] have adopted an era starting in 950&nbsp;BC, the approximate date that the Libyan pharaoh [[Sheshonq I]] came to power in Egypt.\n\n== New Year's Day ==\nThe Roman calendar began the year on 1 January, and this remained the start of the year after the Julian reform. However, even after local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar, they started the new year on different dates. The Alexandrian calendar in Egypt started on 29 August (30 August after an Alexandrian leap year). Several local provincial calendars were aligned to start on the birthday of Augustus, 23 September. The indiction caused the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] year, which used the Julian calendar, to begin on 1 September; this date is still used in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] for the beginning of the liturgical year. When the Julian calendar was adopted in AD 988 by [[Vladimir I of Kiev]], the year was numbered Anno Mundi 6496, beginning on 1 March, six months after the start of the Byzantine Anno Mundi year with the same number. In 1492 (AM 7000), [[Ivan III]], according to church tradition, realigned the start of the year to 1 September, so that AM 7000 only lasted for six months in Russia, from 1 March to 31 August 1492.<ref>[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=http://grigam.narod.ru/kalend/kalen19.htm \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 (Calendar history in Russia and in the USSR).]</ref>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages 1 January retained the name ''[[New Year's Day]]'' (or an equivalent name) in all [[western Europe]]an countries (affiliated with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]), since the medieval calendar continued to display the months from January to December (in twelve columns containing 28 to 31 days each), just as the Romans had. However, most of those countries began their numbered year on 25 December (the Nativity of [[Jesus]]), 25 March (the [[Annunciation|Incarnation of Jesus]]), or even Easter, as in [[France]] (see the [[Liturgical year]] article for more details).\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, the year most commonly began on 25 December, which, as (approximately) the [[winter solstice]], had marked the start of the year in pagan times, though 25 March (the [[equinox]]) is occasionally documented in the 11th century. Sometimes the start of the year was reckoned as 24 September, the start of the so-called \"western indiction\" introduced by Bede.<ref>M. L. R. Beaven, \"The Regnal Dates of Alfred, Edward the Elder, and Athelstan\", English Historical Review 32 (1917) 517\u2013531; idem, \"The Beginning of the Year in the Alfredian Chronicle (866\u201387)\", English Historical Review 33 (1918) 328\u2013342.</ref> These practices changed after the Norman conquest.

The following table shows the years in which various countries adopted 1 January as the start of the year. Eastern European countries, with populations showing allegiance to the [[orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]], began the year on 1 September from about 988.

Most [[Christian denomination]]s in the west and areas evangelised by western churches have made the same change for their [[liturgical calendar]]s.\n\nDuring the changeover between calendars and for some time afterwards, [[dual dating]] was used in documents and gave the date according to both systems. In contemporary as well as modern texts that describe events during the period of change, it is customary to clarify to which calendar a given date refers by using an [[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S. or N.S. suffix]] (denoting Old Style, Julian or New Style, Gregorian).\n\n===Transition history===\n{{See also|Gregorian calendar}}\nThe Julian calendar was in general use in Europe and northern Africa until 1582, when [[Pope Gregory XIII]] promulgated the Gregorian calendar. Reform was required because too many leap days are added with respect to the astronomical seasons on the Julian scheme. On average, the astronomical solstices and the equinoxes advance by 10.8 minutes per year against the Julian year. As a result, the [[Computus|calculated date]] of Easter gradually moved out of alignment with the March equinox.\n[[File:Julian to Gregorian Date Change.png|thumb|This is a visual example of the official date change from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian.]]\nWhile Hipparchus and presumably [[Sosigenes of Alexandria|Sosigenes]] were aware of the discrepancy, although not of its correct value,{{sfn|Richards|1998|page=216}} it was evidently felt to be of little importance at the time of the Julian reform. However, it accumulated significantly over time: the Julian calendar gained a day about every 134 years. By 1582, it was ten days out of alignment from where it supposedly had been in 325 during the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]].\n\nThe Gregorian calendar was soon adopted by most Catholic countries (e.g., Spain, Portugal, Poland, most of Italy). Protestant countries followed later, and some countries of eastern Europe even later. In the British Empire (including the [[United States|American colonies]]), Wednesday {{nowrap|2 September 1752}} was followed by Thursday {{nowrap|14 September 1752}}. For 12 years from 1700 Sweden used a [[Swedish calendar|modified Julian calendar]], and adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1753.\n\nSince the Julian and Gregorian calendars were long used simultaneously, although in different places, calendar dates in the transition period are often ambiguous, unless it is specified which calendar was being used. In some circumstances, double dates might be used, one in each calendar. The notation [[Old Style and New Style dates|\"Old Style\" (O.S.)]] is sometimes used to indicate a date in the Julian calendar, as opposed to [[Old Style and New Style dates|\"New Style\" (N.S.)]], which either represents the Julian date with the start of the year as 1 January or a full mapping onto the Gregorian calendar. This notation is used to clarify dates from countries which continued to use the Julian calendar after the Gregorian reform, such as Great Britain, which did not switch to the reformed calendar until 1752, or Russia, which did not switch until 1918. This is why the Russian Revolution of 7 November 1917 N.S. is known as the [[October Revolution]], because it began on 25 October OS.\n\nThroughout the long transition period, the Julian calendar has continued to diverge from the Gregorian. This has happened in whole-day steps, as leap days which were dropped in certain centennial years in the Gregorian calendar continued to be present in the Julian calendar. Thus, in the year 1700 the difference increased to 11 days; in 1800, 12; and in 1900, 13. Since 2000 was a leap year according to both the Julian and Gregorian calendars, the difference of 13 days did not change in that year: {{nowrap|29 February 2000}} (Gregorian) fell on {{nowrap|16 February 2000}} (Julian). This difference will persist until the last day of February 2100 (Gregorian), since 2100 is ''not'' a Gregorian leap year, but ''is'' a Julian leap year.

The \"Revised Julian calendar\" was endorsed by a [[synod]] in [[Constantinople]] in May 1923, consisting of a solar part which was and will be identical to the Gregorian calendar until the year 2800, and a lunar part which calculated [[Easter]] astronomically at [[Jerusalem]]. All Orthodox churches refused to accept the lunar part, so almost all Orthodox churches continue to celebrate Easter according to the Julian calendar (with the exception of the [[Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church|Estonian Orthodox Church]]\nand the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]]).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.estonianevents.com/estonianorthodoxchurch\n|title=Estonian Orthodox Church (Estonian Events)\n|publisher=Vancouveri Eesti Apostliku \u00d5igeusu Kirik\n|date=2010\n}}</ref><ref>Bishop Photius of Triaditsa, [http://orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/photii_2.aspx \"The 70th Anniversary of the Pan-Orthodox Congress, Part II of II\"]; {{cite web\n|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Moscow-affiliated+Russian+Orthodox+church+grows+in+Helsinki/1135230488329\n|date=21 September 2007\n|title=HELSINGIN SANOMAT (International edition)\n}}</ref>\n\nThe solar part of the Revised Julian calendar was accepted by only some Orthodox churches. Those that did accept it, with hope for improved dialogue and negotiations with the western denominations, were the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], the Patriarchates of [[Greek Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antioch]], the Orthodox Churches of [[Church of Greece|Greece]], [[Orthodox Church of Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romania]], [[Polish Orthodox Church|Poland]] (from 1924 to 2014; it is still permitted to use the Revised Julian calendar in parishes that want it), [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgaria]] (in 1963), and the [[Orthodox Church in America]] (although some OCA parishes are permitted to use the Julian calendar). Thus these churches celebrate the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] on the same day that western Christians do, 25 December Gregorian until 2799.\n\nThe Orthodox Churches of [[Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbia]], [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church|Montenegro]], Poland (from 15 June 2014), [[Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonia]], [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|Georgia]], [[History of Christianity in Ukraine|Ukraine]], and the [[Greek Old Calendarists]] and other groups continue to use the Julian calendar, thus they celebrate the Nativity on 25 December ''Julian'' (which is 7 January ''Gregorian'' until 2100). The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] has some parishes in the West which celebrate the Nativity on 25 December ''Gregorian'' until 2799.\n\nParishes of the [[Orthodox Church in America Bulgarian Diocese]], both before and after the 1976 transfer of that diocese from the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] to the Orthodox Church in America, were permitted to use this date. Some [[Old Calendarist]] groups which stand in opposition to the [[state church]]es of their homelands will use the [[Great Feast]] of the [[Epiphany (feast)|Theophany]] ([[January 6 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|6 January]] ''Julian''/19 January ''Gregorian'') as a day for [[Crucession|religious processions]] and the [[Great Blessing of Waters]], to publicise their cause.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Easter date in Eastern Orthodoxy===\nMost branches of the Eastern [[Orthodox Church]] use the Julian calendar for [[Computus|calculating the date of Easter]], upon which the timing of all the other [[moveable feast]]s depends.

However, when calculating the Nativity Feast, most observe the Julian calendar. This was traditionally for the sake of unity throughout Christendom. In the west, some Oriental Orthodox Churches either use the Gregorian calendar or are permitted to observe the Nativity according to it.

He served as the eighth [[United States Secretary of State]] immediately before becoming president. During his long diplomatic and political career, Adams also served as an ambassador, [[United States Senator]], and member of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. He was the eldest son of [[John Adams]], who served as president from 1797 to 1801. Initially a [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] like his father, he won election to the presidency as a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], and in the mid-1830s became affiliated with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].\n\nBorn in [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]], [[Massachusetts]], Adams spent much of his youth in Europe, where his father served as a diplomat. After returning to the United States, Adams established a successful legal practice in [[Boston]]. In 1794, President [[George Washington]] appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to the [[Netherlands]], and Adams would serve in high-ranking diplomatic posts until 1801, when [[Thomas Jefferson]] took office as president. Federalist leaders in Massachusetts arranged for Adams's election to the United States Senate in 1802, but Adams broke with the Federalist Party over foreign policy and was denied re-election. In 1809, Adams was appointed as the U.S. ambassador to [[Russia]] by Democratic-Republican President [[James Madison]]. Adams held diplomatic posts for the duration of Madison's presidency, and he served as part of the American delegation that negotiated an end to the [[War of 1812]]. In 1817, newly-elected President [[James Monroe]] selected Adams as his secretary of state. In that role, Adams negotiated the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]], which provided for the American acquisition of [[Florida]]. He also helped formulate the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which became a key tenet of [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]].\n\nThe [[United States presidential election, 1824|presidential election 1824]] was contested by Adams, [[Andrew Jackson]], [[William H. Crawford]], and [[Henry Clay]], all of whom were members of the Democratic-Republican Party. As no candidate won a majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]], the House of Representatives held a [[contingent election]] to determine the president, and Adams won that contingent election with the support of Clay. President Adams called for an ambitious agenda that included [[Internal improvements|federally-funded infrastructure projects]], the establishment of a national university, and engagement with the countries of [[Latin America]], but many of his initiatives were defeated in Congress. During Adams's presidency, the Democratic-Republic Party polarized into two major camps: one group, known as the [[National Republican Party]], supported President Adams, while the other group, known as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], was led by Andrew Jackson. The Democrats proved to be more effective political organizers than Adams and his National Republican supporters, and Jackson decisively defeated Adams in the [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828 presidential election]].\n\nRather than retiring from public service, Adams won election to the House of Representatives, where he would serve from 1831 to his death in 1848. He joined the [[Anti-Masonic Party]] in the early 1830s before becoming a member of the Whig Party, which united those opposed to President Jackson. During his time in Congress, Adams became increasingly critical of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] and of the Southern leaders whom he believed controlled the Democratic Party. He was particularly opposed to the [[annexation of Texas]] and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], which he saw as a war to extend slavery. He also led the repeal of the \"[[gag rule]],\" which had prevented the House of Representatives from debating petitions to [[abolitionism in the United States|abolish slavery]]. Historians generally concur that Adams was one of the greatest diplomats and secretaries of state in American history, but [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|they tend to rank]] him as an average president.\n\n==Early life, education, and early career==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of John Quincy Adams.svg|upright=0.8|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of John Quincy Adams]]\n\nJohn Quincy Adams was born on July 11, 1767, to [[John Adams|John]] and [[Abigail Adams|Abigail]] Adams (n\u00e9e Smith) in a part of [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]], [[Province of Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] that is now [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Rettig| first=Polly M.| title=John Quincy Adams Birthplace |url={{NHLS url|id=66000128}}| publisher=[[National Park Service]]| accessdate=November 1, 2011| date=April 3, 1978}}</ref> He was named for his mother's maternal grandfather, [[John Quincy|Colonel John Quincy]], after whom Quincy, Massachusetts, is named.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Herring| first1=James| last2=Longacre| first2=James Barton| title=The National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans| publisher=D.

In 1791, he wrote a series of pseudonymously-published essays in which he argued that Britain provided a better governmental model than France. Two years later, he published another series of essays in which he attacked [[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat]], a French diplomat who sought to undermine President [[George Washington]]'s policy of neutrality in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|2017|pages=35\u201336}}.</ref> In 1794, Washington appointed Adams as the [[United States Ambassador to the Netherlands|U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands]]; Adams considered declining the role but ultimately took the position at the advice of his father.<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|2017|page=38}}.</ref> While abroad, Adams continued to urge neutrality, arguing that the United States would benefit economically by staying out of the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars.<ref>{{harvnb|Edel|2014|pages=83\u201386}}.</ref> His chief duty as the ambassador to the Netherlands was to secure and maintain the loans that were essential to U.S. finances.

His disaffection was driven by the party's declining popularity, disagreements over foreign policy, and Adams's hostility to [[Timothy Pickering]], a Federalist Party leader whom Adams viewed as overly favorable to Britain. Unlike other New England Federalists, Adams supported the Jefferson administration's [[Louisiana Purchase]] and generally favored expansionist policies. Adams was the lone Federalist in Congress to vote for the [[Non-importation Act]] of 1806, which was designed to punish Britain for its attacks on American shipping in the midst of the ongoing [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Adams became increasingly frustrated with the unwillingness of other Federalists to condemn British actions, including [[impressment]], and he moved closer to the Jefferson administration. After Adams supported the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], the Federalist-controlled Massachusetts legislature elected Adams's successor several months before the end of his term, and Adams resigned from the Senate shortly thereafter.<ref>{{harvnb|Thompson|1991|pages=165\u2013181}}</ref>\n\nWhile a member of the Senate, Adams served as a professor of logic at [[Brown University]]<ref>{{harvnb|McCullough|2001|page=587}}.</ref> and as the [[Boylston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory|Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory]] at [[Harvard University]]. Adams's devotion to classical rhetoric shaped his response to public issues, and he would remain inspired by those rhetorical ideals long after the neo-classicalism and deferential politics of the founding generation were eclipsed by the commercial ethos and mass democracy of the [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Era]]. Many of Adams's idiosyncratic positions were rooted in his abiding devotion to the [[Cicero]]nian ideal of the citizen-orator \"speaking well\" to promote the welfare of the polis.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Lyon|last=Rathbun|title=The Ciceronian Rhetoric of John Quincy Adams|journal=Rhetorica|year=2000|volume=18|issue=2|pages=175\u2013215|doi=10.1525/rh.2000.18.2.175}}</ref> He was also influenced by the classical republican ideal of civic eloquence espoused by British philosopher [[David Hume]].<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Hume|title=Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects|publisher=T.

In mid-1812, the United States declared war against Britain, beginning the [[War of 1812]]. Tsar Alexander attempted to mediate the conflict between Britain and the United States, and President Madison appointed Adams, Secretary of the Treasury [[Albert Gallatin]], and Federalist Senator [[James A.

The treaty was signed on December 24, 1814. The United States did not gain any concessions from the treaty, but could boast that it had survived a war against the strongest power in the world.

In 1817, the two countries agreed to the [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]], which limited naval armaments on the [[Great Lakes]]. Negotiations between the two powers continued, resulting in the [[Treaty of 1818]], which defined the [[Canada\u2013United States border]] west of the Great Lakes. The boundary was set at the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]], while the territory to the west of the mountains, known as [[Oregon Country]], would be jointly occupied.

In the South, Spain retained control of [[Spanish Florida|Florida]], which the U.S. had long sought to purchase. Spain struggled to control the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes active in Florida, and some of those tribes raided U.S. territory. In the West, [[New Spain]] bordered the territory acquired by the U.S. in the Louisiana Purchase, but no clear boundary had been established between U.S. and Spanish territory.<ref name=\"Kaplan 2014 pages=321\u201322\"/> After taking office, Adams began negotiations with [[Luis de On\u00eds]], the Spanish minister to the United States, for the purchase of Florida and the settlement of a border between the U.S. and New Spain. The negotiations were interrupted by an escalation of the [[First Seminole War|Seminole War]], and in December 1818 Monroe ordered General [[Andrew Jackson]] to enter Florida and retaliate against [[Seminole]]s that had raided Georgia. Exceeding his orders, Jackson captured the Spanish outposts of St. Marks and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] and executed two Englishmen. While the rest of the cabinet was outraged by Jackson's actions, Adams defended them as necessary to the country's self-defense, and he eventually convinced Monroe and most of the cabinet to support Jackson.<ref name=\"Kaplan 2014 pages=333\u201337, 348\">{{harvnb|Kaplan|2014|pages=333\u201337, 348}}.</ref> Adams informed Spain that Jackson had been compelled to act by Spain's failure to police its own territory, and he advised Spain to either secure the region or sell it to the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|2017|pages=163\u2013164}}.</ref> The British, meanwhile, declined to risk their recent rapprochement with the United States, and did not make a major diplomatic issue out of Jackson's execution of two British nationals.<ref>{{harvnb|Howe|2007|p=106}}</ref>\n\nNegotiations between Spain and the United States continued, and Spain agreed to cede Florida. The determination of the western boundary of the United States proved more difficult. American expansionists favored setting the border at the [[Rio Grande River]], but Spain, intent on protecting its colony of [[New Spain|Mexico]] from American encroachment, insisted on setting the boundary at the [[Sabine River (Texas\u2013Louisiana)|Sabine River]]. At Monroe's direction, Adams agreed to the Sabine River boundary, but he insisted that Spain cede its claims on Oregon Country.<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|2017|pages=164\u2013166}}.</ref> Adams was deeply interested in establishing American control over the Oregon Country, partly because he believed that control of that region would spur trade with [[Asia]].

In 1822, following the conclusion of the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, the Monroe administration recognized the independence of several Latin American countries, including [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]]. In 1823, British Foreign Secretary [[George Canning]] suggested that the U.S. and Britain should work together to preserve the independence of these fledgling republics. The cabinet debated whether or not to accept the offer, but Adams opposed it. Instead, Adams urged Monroe to publicly declare U.S. opposition to any European attempt to colonize or re-take control of territory in the Americas, while also committing the U.S. to neutrality with respect to European affairs. In his December 1823 [[State of the Union|annual message to Congress]], Monroe laid out the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which was largely built upon Adams's ideas.<ref name=\"kaplan380385\">{{harvnb|Kaplan|2014|pages=380\u201385}}.</ref> In issuing the Monroe Doctrine, the United States displayed a new level of assertiveness in international relations, as the doctrine represented the country's first claim to a [[sphere of influence]].

Texas had largely been settled by Americans from the Southern United States, and many of those settlers owned slaves despite an 1829 Mexican law that abolished slavery. Many in the United States and Texas thus favored the admission of Texas into the union as a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]]. Adams considered the issue of Texas to be \"a question of far deeper root and more overshadowing branches than any or all others that agitate the country,\" and he emerged as one of the leading congressional opponents of annexation. Adams had sought to acquire Texas when he served as secretary of state, but he argued that, because Mexico had abolished slavery, the acquisition of Texas would the transform the region from a free territory into a slave state. He also feared that the annexation of Texas would encourage Southern expansionists to pursue other potential slave states, including [[Cuba]]. Adams's strong stance may have played a role in discouraging Van Buren from pushing for the annexation of Texas during his presidency.<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|2017|pages=371\u2013375}}.</ref>\n\nWhig nominee [[William Henry Harrison]] defeated Van Buren in the [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840 presidential election]], and the Whigs gained control of both houses of Congress for the first time.

Adams saw Tyler as an agent of \"the slave-driving, Virginia, Jeffersonian school, principled against all improvement.\" After Tyler vetoed a bill to restore the national bank, Whig congressmen expelled Tyler from the party. Adams was appointed chairman of a special committee that explored impeaching Tyler, and Adams presented a scathing report of Tyler that argued that his actions warranted impeachment.

Polk deployed a military detachment led by General [[Zachary Taylor]] to back up his assertion that the [[Rio Grande River]] constituted the Southern border of both Texas and the United States. After Taylor's forces clashed with Mexican soldiers north of the Rio Grande, Polk asked for a declaration of war in early 1846, asserting that Mexico had invaded American territory. Though some Whigs questioned whether Mexico had really begun an aggressive war against the United States, both houses of Congress declared war, with the House voting 174-to-14 to approve the declaration.

The start of the period was marked by the major [[Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event]].

Similarly, in [[stratigraphy]],  the Jurassic is divided into the [[Lower Jurassic]], [[Middle Jurassic]], and [[Upper Jurassic]] [[Series (stratigraphy)|series]] of rock formations.\n\nThe Jurassic is named after the [[Jura Mountains]] within the [[European Alps]], where [[limestone]] strata from the period were first identified.\nBy the beginning of the Jurassic, the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] had begun [[rift]]ing into two landmasses: [[Laurasia]] to the north, and [[Gondwana]] to the south. This created more coastlines and shifted the continental climate from dry to humid, and many of the [[arid]] deserts of the Triassic were replaced by lush rainforests.\n\nOn land, the fauna transitioned from the Triassic fauna, dominated by both [[Dinosauromorpha|dinosauromorph]] and [[Crocodylomorpha|crocodylomorph]] [[archosaur]]s, to one dominated by [[dinosaur]]s alone. The first [[bird]]s also appeared during the Jurassic, having evolved from a branch of [[theropod]] dinosaurs. Other major events include the appearance of the earliest lizards, and the evolution of [[theria]]n mammals, including primitive [[placental]]s. Crocodilians made the transition from a terrestrial to an aquatic mode of life.

L. B. Harris was registered in Solihull in July\u2013September 1903.</ref> was an English [[science fiction]] writer best known for his works written using the pen name '''John Wyndham''', although he also used other combinations of his names, such as '''John Beynon''' and '''Lucas Parkes'''. Some of his works were set in [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction|post-apocalyptic]] landscapes. His best known works include ''[[The Day of the Triffids]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Midwich Cuckoos]]'' (1957), the latter filmed twice as ''Village of the Damned''.\n\n==Early life==\nWyndham was born in the village of [[Dorridge]] near [[Knowle, West Midlands|Knowle]], [[Warwickshire]] (now [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]]), England, the son of George Beynon Harris, a [[barrister]], and Gertrude Parkes, the daughter of a Birmingham [[ironmaster]].<ref name=oxdnb />\n\nHis early childhood was spent in [[Edgbaston]] in Birmingham, but when he was 8&nbsp;years&nbsp;old his parents separated and he and his brother, the writer [[Vivian Beynon Harris]], spent the rest of their childhood at a number of English [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory]] and [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]], including [[Blundell's School]] in [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]], Devon, during [[World War I]]. His longest and final stay was at [[Bedales School]] near [[Petersfield]] in Hampshire (1918\u201321), which he left at the age of 18, and where he blossomed and was happy.\n\n==Career==\nAfter leaving school, Wyndham tried several careers, including farming, law, [[commercial art]] and advertising, but mostly relied on an allowance from his family. He eventually turned to writing for money in 1925 and, by 1931, was selling short stories and serial fiction to American science fiction magazines, most under the pen names \"John Beynon\" and \"John Beynon Harris\", although he also wrote some detective stories.\n\n==World War II==\nDuring [[World War II]], Wyndham first served as a [[Censorship|censor]] in the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]],<ref name=\"kirkusreviews1\">{{cite web|last=Liptak |first=Andrew |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/john-wyndham-and-global-expansion-science-fiction/ |title=John Wyndham and the Global Expansion of Science Fiction |publisher=Kirkus Reviews |date=2015-05-07 |accessdate=2017-03-05}}</ref> then joined the British Army, serving as a Corporal [[cipher]] operator in the [[Royal Corps of Signals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/10/johnwyndham |title=John Wyndham |publisher=The Guardian |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2017-03-05}}</ref> He participated in the [[Normandy landings]], although he was not involved in the first days of the operation.<ref name=\"oxdnb\">{{cite web | url = http://oxforddnb.com/view/article/33728 |title= Harris, John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |last = Aldiss |first=Brian W |accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Postwar==\nAfter the war, Wyndham returned to writing, inspired by the success of his brother, who had four novels published. He altered his writing style; and, by 1951, using the John Wyndham pen name for the first time, he wrote the novel ''[[The Day of the Triffids]]''. His pre-war writing career was not mentioned in the book's publicity, and people were allowed to assume that it was a first novel from a previously unknown writer.\n\nThe book proved to be an enormous success<ref name=\"kirkusreviews1\"/> and established Wyndham as an important exponent of science fiction. During his lifetime, he wrote and published six more novels under the name John Wyndham.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1963, he married Grace Isobel Wilson, whom he had known for more than 20&nbsp;years; the couple remained married until he died. He and Grace lived for several years in separate rooms at the [[Penn Club, London|Penn Club]], London and later lived near [[Petersfield, Hampshire]], just outside the grounds of [[Bedales School]]. A collection of his letters to Grace written during the Second World War are held in the University of Liverpool archive. Wyndham explores the issues around women being forced by their biology to choose between careers and love in ''[[Trouble with Lichen]]''.\n\n==Death==\nHe died in 1969, aged 65, at his home in [[Petersfield, England|Petersfield]], survived by his wife and his brother.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=4820 | work =Literary Encyclopedia | title = John Wyndham | date = 7 November 2006 |accessdate= 1 May 2010}}</ref> Subsequently, some of his unsold work was published; and his earlier work was re-published.

A few have been filmed: ''[[Consider Her Ways]]'', ''[[Random Quest]]'', ''Dumb Martian'', ''A Long Spoon'', ''Jizzle'' (filmed as ''Maria'') and ''Time to Rest'' (filmed as ''No Place Like Earth'').<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0943909/ |title=IMDb}}</ref> There is also a radio version of ''Survival''.\n\nMost of Wyndham's novels are set in the 1950s among middle-class English people. [[Brian Aldiss]], another British science fiction writer, disparagingly labelled some of them \"[[cosy catastrophe]]s\", especially  ''[[The Day of the Triffids]]'',{{Sfn | Aldiss | 1973 | p = 293}} but the critic L.J. Hurst pointed out that in ''Triffids'' the main character witnesses several murders, suicides and misadventures, and is frequently in mortal danger himself.<ref>{{citation |url=http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/l.j.hurst/weredead.htm |last=Hurst |first=L.

Eugeniusz Oko\u0144 [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Roman Catholic priest]] issued him a forged [[baptism]]al certificate, and the Lewinkopf family survived the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] thanks to local villagers who offered [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|assistance to Polish Jews]], often at great risk.

It is the story of Chance the gardener, a man with few distinctive qualities who emerges from nowhere and suddenly becomes the heir to the throne of a Wall Street tycoon and a presidential policy adviser. His simple and straightforward responses to popular concerns are praised as visionary despite the fact that no one actually understands what he is really saying. Many questions surround his mysterious origins, and filling in the blanks in his background proves impossible.\n\nThe novel was made into a [[Being There|1979 movie]] directed by [[Hal Ashby]], and starring [[Peter Sellers]], who was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for the role, and [[Melvyn Douglas]], who won the award for Best Supporting Actor.  The [[screenplay]] was co-authored by award-winning [[screenwriter]] [[Robert C. Jones]] with Kosi\u0144ski. The film won the 1981 [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (Film) Best Screenplay Award, as well as the 1980 [[Writers Guild of America Award]] (Screen) for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium.

Weinberger alleged in his 2000 book ''Karmic Traces'' that Kosi\u0144ski was not fluent in English at the time of its writing.<ref name = \"Weinberger\">Eliot Weinberger ''Genuine Fakes'' in his collection ''Karmic Traces''; New Directions, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8112-1456-8}}</ref>\n\nIn a review of ''Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski: A Biography'' by James Park Sloan, D. G. Myers, Associate Professor of English at [[Texas A&M University]] wrote \"For years Kosinski passed off ''The Painted Bird'' as the true story of his own experience during the Holocaust.  Long before writing it he regaled friends and dinner parties with macabre tales of a childhood spent in hiding among the Polish peasantry. Among those who were fascinated was Dorothy de Santillana, a senior editor at [[Houghton Mifflin]], to whom Kosinski confided that he had a manuscript based on his experiences. Upon accepting the book for publication Santillana said, \"It is my understanding that, fictional as the material may sound, it is straight autobiography.\" Although he backed away from this claim, Kosinski never wholly disavowed it.<ref name = \"Myers\">[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9610/myers.html D. G. Myers, ''Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography'' by James Park Sloan]</ref>\n\nM. A. Orthofer addressed Weinberger's assertion: \"Kosinski was, in many respects, a fake \u2013 possibly near as genuine a one as Weinberger could want.  (One aspect of the best fakes is the lingering doubt that, possibly, there is some authenticity behind them \u2013 as is the case with Kosinski.)  Kosinski famously liked to pretend he was someone he wasn't (as do many of the characters in his books), he occasionally published under a pseudonym, and, apparently, he plagiarized and forged left and right.\"<ref name = \"Orthofer\">\n[http://www.complete-review.com/quarterly/vol2/issue1/ffakes.htm \"Facts and Fakes\" by M.A.Orthofer]</ref>\n\nKosi\u0144ski himself addressed these claims in the introduction to the 1976 reissue of ''The Painted Bird'', saying that \"Well-intentioned writers, critics, and readers sought facts to back up their claims that the novel was autobiographical. They wanted to cast me in the role of spokesman for my generation, especially for those who had survived the war; but for me, survival was an individual action that earned the survivor the right to speak only for himself. Facts about my life and my origins, I felt, should not be used to test the book's authenticity, any more than they should be used to encourage readers to read ''The Painted Bird''. Furthermore, I felt then, as I do now, that fiction and autobiography are very different modes.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=''The Painted Bird''|last= Kosinski|first=Jerry|pages=xiii\u2013xiv|year=1976|publisher=Grove Press Books|isbn=0-8021-3422-X|nopp=true}}</ref>\n\n=== Plagiarism allegations ===\nIn June 1982, a ''[[Village Voice]]'' report by Geoffrey Stokes and Eliot Fremont-Smith accused Kosi\u0144ski of [[plagiarism]], claiming that much of his work was derivative of prewar books unfamiliar to English readers, and that ''Being There'' was a plagiarism of ''Kariera Nikodema Dyzmy'' \u2014 ''[[The Career of Nicodemus Dyzma]]'' \u2014 a 1932 Polish bestseller by [[Tadeusz Do\u0142\u0119ga-Mostowicz]].  They also alleged Kosi\u0144ski wrote ''The Painted Bird'' in Polish, and had it secretly translated into English.  The report claimed that Kosi\u0144ski's books had actually been ghost-written by \"assistant editors\", finding [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] differences among Kosi\u0144ski's novels.  Kosi\u0144ski, according to them, had depended upon his free-lance editors for \"the sort of composition that we usually call writing.\" American biographer [[James Park Sloan|James Sloan]] notes that New York poet, publisher and translator, [[George Reavey]], claimed to have written ''The Painted Bird'' for Kosi\u0144ski.<ref>[[George Reavey]] [http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9610/myers.html D. G. Myers, ''Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography'' by James Park Sloan]</ref>\n\nThe article found a more realistic picture of Kosi\u0144ski's life during the Holocaust \u2014 a view which was supported by biographers [[Joanna Siedlecka]] and Sloan.  The article asserted that ''The Painted Bird,'' assumed to be semi-[[Autobiography|autobiographical]], was largely a work of fiction.  The information showed that rather than wandering the Polish countryside, as his fictional character did, Kosi\u0144ski spent the war years in hiding with [[Polish Catholics]].\n\n[[Terence Blacker]], a profitable English [[publisher]] (who helped publish Kosi\u0144ski's books) and author of children's books and mysteries for adults, wrote an article published in ''[[The Independent]]'' in 2002:\n\n<blockquote>The significant point about Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski was that... his books... had a vision and a voice consistent with one another and with the man himself. The problem was perhaps that he was a successful, worldly author who played polo, moved in fashionable circles and even appeared as an actor in Warren Beatty's ''Reds''.  He seemed to have had an adventurous and rather kinky sexuality which, to many, made him all the more suspect.  All in all, he was a perfect candidate for the snarling pack of literary hangers-on to turn on.  There is something about a storyteller becoming rich and having a reasonably full private life that has a powerful potential to irritate so that, when things go wrong, it causes a very special kind of joy.<ref name=\"Blacker\">\n[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020617/ai_n12627315 \"Plagiarism?

'There was a hollow space at the center of Kosinski that had resulted from denying his past,' Sloan writes, 'and his whole life had become a race to fill in that hollow space before it caused him to implode, collapsing inward upon himself like a burnt-out star.' On this theory, Kosinski emerges as a classic borderline personality, frantically defending himself against... all-out psychosis.<ref name = \"Myers\" /></blockquote>\n\nJournalist John Corry wrote a 6,000-word feature article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in November 1982, responding and defending Kosi\u0144ski, which appeared on the front page of the Arts and Leisure section.  Among other things, Corry alleged that reports claiming that \"Kosinski was a [[plagiarist]] in the pay of the [[C.I.A.]] were the product of a Polish Communist [[disinformation]] campaign.\"<ref name = \"Corry(2)\">[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C1FFC3D5D0C748CDDA80994DA484D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fC%2fCorry%2c%20John select.nytimes.com]</ref>\n\nKosi\u0144ski himself responded that he had never maintained that the book was autobiographical, even though years earlier he confided to Houghton Mifflin editor Santillana that his manuscript \"draws upon a childhood spent, by the casual chances of war, in the remotest villages of [[Eastern Europe]].\"<ref name = \"Myers\" /> In 1988, he wrote ''The Hermit of 69th Street'', in which he sought to demonstrate the absurdity of investigating prior work by inserting footnotes for practically every term in the book.<ref name = \"Komisar\">[http://www.nytheatre-wire.com/lk01033t.htm#2 New York Theatre Wire: \"More Lies About Jerzy\" by Lucy Komisar]</ref> \"Ironically,\" wrote theatre critic Lucy Komisar, \"possibly his only true book&nbsp;... about a successful author who is shown to be a fraud.\"<ref name = \"Komisar\" />\n\nDespite repudiation of the ''Village Voice'' allegations in detailed articles in ''The New York Times'', ''The Los Angeles Times'', and other publications, Kosi\u0144ski remained tainted. \"I think it contributed to his death,\" said [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], a friend and fellow Polish emigrant.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>\n\n==Television, radio, film, and newspaper appearances==\nKosi\u0144ski appeared 12 times on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' during 1971\u201373, and ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' in 1974, was a guest on the talk radio show of [[Long John Nebel]], posed half-naked for a cover photograph by [[Annie Leibovitz]] for ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in 1982, and presented the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for screenwriting in 1982.\n\nHe also played the role of [[Bolshevik]] revolutionary and [[Politburo]] member [[Grigory Zinoviev]] in [[Warren Beatty]]'s film ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''.  The ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine critic wrote:  \"As Reed's Soviet nemesis, novelist Jerzy Kosinski acquits himself nicely\u2013a tundra of ice against Reed's all-American fire.\"  ''[[Newsweek]]'' complimented Kosinski's \"delightfully abrasive\" performance.\n\n== Friendships ==\nKosi\u0144ski was friends with [[Roman Polanski]], with whom he attended the [[National Film School in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], and said he narrowly missed being at Polanski and [[Sharon Tate]]'s house on the night Tate was murdered by [[Charles Manson]]'s followers in 1969, due to lost luggage.  His novel ''Blind Date'' portrayed the Manson murders.<ref name=people1/>\n\nIn 1984, Polanski denied Kosi\u0144ski's story in his autobiography. Journalist John Taylor of [[New York Magazine]] believes Polanski was mistaken. \"Although it was a single sentence in a 461-page book, reviewers focused on it. But the accusation was untrue: Jerzy and Kiki ''had'' been invited to stay with Tate the night of the Manson murders, and they missed being killed as well only because they stopped in New York en route from Paris because their luggage had been misdirected.\" The reason why Taylor believes this is that \"a friend of Kosi\u0144ski's wrote a letter to the ''Times'', which was published in the ''Book Review'', describing the detailed plans he and Jerzy had made to meet that weekend at Polanski's house on Cielo Drive. Few people saw the letter.\" The NYM article does not contain the name of this friend, nor the particular issue of the ''Book Review'' in which this letter is supposed to have been published, nor names of the 'few' who may have read the letter.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>\n\nKosi\u0144ski was also friends with [[Wojciech Frykowski]] and [[Abigail Folger]].

Bantam Reconnaissance Car===\nWhen it became clear that the United States would be involved in the European theater of [[European theatre of World War II|World War II]], the Army contacted 135 companies to create working prototypes of a four-wheel drive reconnaissance car. Only two companies responded: [[American Austin Car Company|American Bantam]] Car Company and [[Willys|Willys-Overland]]. The Army set a seemingly impossible deadline of 49 days to supply a working prototype. Willys asked for more time, but was refused. The Bantam Car Company had only a skeleton staff left on the payroll and solicited [[Karl Probst]], a talented freelance designer from Detroit. After turning down Bantam's initial request, Probst responded to an Army request and began work on July 17, 1940, initially without salary.\n\nProbst laid out full plans in just two days for the Bantam prototype known as the BRC or Bantam Reconnaissance Car, working up a cost estimate the next day. Bantam's bid was submitted on July 22, complete with blueprints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cossor.com.au/jeep_1.html |title=The Military Jeep |publisher=Cossor.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref> Much of the vehicle could be assembled from off-the-shelf automotive parts, and custom four-wheel drivetrain components were to be supplied by [[Dana Holding Corporation|Spicer]]. The hand-built prototype was completed in [[Butler, Pennsylvania]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM8NM |title=Invention of the Jeep  - Pennsylvania Historical Markers |publisher=Waymarking.com |date=2006-03-09|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref> and driven to [[Fort Holabird|Camp Holabird]], [[Maryland]] on September 23 for Army testing. The vehicle met all the Army's criteria except engine torque.\n\n===Development \u2013 2. Enter Willys and Ford===\nThe Army thought that the Bantam company was too small to supply the required number of vehicles, so it supplied the Bantam design to Willys and [[Ford]], and encouraged them to modify the design. The resulting [[Ford Pygmy|Ford \"Pygmy\"]] and Willys \"Quad\" prototypes looked very similar to the Bantam BRC prototype, and Spicer supplied very similar four-wheel drivetrain components to all three manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeep-history.com/fordjeep.asp|title=Ford Manufacturers a Jeep|publisher=Jeep History|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n1,500 of each model (Bantam BRC-40, Ford GP, and Willys MA) were built and extensively field-tested.

The Willys version became the standard Jeep design, designated the [[Willys MB|model MB]] and was built at their plant in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. The familiar pressed-metal Jeep grille was a Ford design feature and incorporated in the final design by the Army.\n\nBecause the US War Department required a large number of vehicles in a short time, Willys-Overland granted the US Government a non-exclusive license to allow another company to manufacture vehicles using Willys' specifications. The Army chose Ford as a second supplier, building Jeeps to the Willys' design.

An [[amphibious vehicle|amphibious]] jeep, the model GPA, or \"seep\" (Sea Jeep) was built for Ford in modest numbers but it could not be considered a huge success\u2014it was neither a good off-road vehicle nor a good boat. As part of the war effort, nearly 30% of all Jeep production was supplied to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]].\n\n==Post-war military Jeeps==\nThe Jeep has been widely imitated around the world, including in France by [[Delahaye]] and by [[Hotchkiss et Cie]] (after 1954, Hotchkiss manufactured Jeeps under license from Willys), and in Japan by [[Mitsubishi Motors]] and [[Toyota Land Cruiser|Toyota]]. The [[Land Rover]] was inspired by the Jeep. The utilitarian good looks of the original Jeep have been hailed by industrial designers and museum curators alike. The [[Museum of Modern Art]] described the Jeep as a masterpiece of [[Industrial design|functionalist design]], and has periodically exhibited the Jeep as part of its collection.<ref>Leigh Brown, Patricia, \"Where Do You Hang The 747?\", ''The New York Times'', December 13, 1998</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art |title= New Acquisitions\u2014Smart Car, Volkswagen \"Beetle,\" and Willys-Overland Jeep\u2014Join Three Other Automobiles in MoMA's Collection |date=June 2002 |url=http://www.itibitismart.com/pdf/moma_smart_acquisition.pdf  |accessdate=2010-11-30}}</ref> [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning war correspondent [[Ernie Pyle]] called the jeep, along with the [[G.I.

The first Jeepneys were military-surplus MBs and GPWs, left behind in the war-ravaged country following World War II and Filipino independence. Jeepneys were built from Jeeps by lengthening and widening the rear \"tub\" of the vehicle, allowing them to carry more passengers. Over the years, Jeepneys have become the most ubiquitous symbol of the modern Philippines, even as they have been decorated in more elaborate and flamboyant styles by their owners. Most Jeepneys today are scratch-built by local manufacturers, using different powertrains. Some are even constructed from stainless steel.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn the United States military, the Jeep has been supplanted by a number of vehicles (e.g. Ford's [[M151]]) of which the latest is the [[Humvee]].\n\n===CJ-V35/U===\nAfter World War II, Jeep began to experiment with new designs, including a model that could drive under water. On February 1, 1950, contract N8ss-2660 was approved for 1,000 units \"especially adapted for general reconnaissance or command communications\" and \"constructed for short period underwater operation such as encountered in landing and fording operations.\" The engine was modified with a snorkel system so that the engine could properly breathe under water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cj3apage.com/index/CJ-V35U.htm |title=The 3A's Navy Cousin - The CJ-V35/U |publisher=Cj3apage.com |date=1950-02-01 |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:M715.jpg|thumb|right|Jeep M715]]\n\n===M715===\nIn 1965, Jeep developed the [[Kaiser Jeep M715|M715]] 1.25-ton army truck, a militarized version of the civilian J-series Jeep truck, which served extensively in the [[Vietnam War]]. It had heavier full-floating axles and a foldable, vertical, flat windshield. Today, it serves other countries, and is still being produced by [[Kia Motors|Kia]] under license.\n\n==Jeep etymology==\n{{See also|Willys MB#How the jeep got its name}}\nMany explanations of the origin of the word ''jeep'' have proven difficult to verify. The most widely held theory is that the military designation ''GP'' (for ''Government Purposes'' or ''General Purpose'') was slurred into the word ''Jeep'' in the same way that the contemporary ''HMMWV'' (for ''High-Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle'') has become known as the [[Humvee]]. Joe Frazer, [[Willys-Overland]] President from 1939 to 1944, claimed to have coined the word ''jeep'' by [[Relaxed pronunciation|slurring]] the initials G.P.<ref name=JTUL>{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Arch | title = Jeep: The Unstoppable Legend | publisher = Publications International | year = 2001 | page = 42 | isbn = 0-7853-5562-6}}</ref>  There are no contemporaneous uses of \"GP\" before later attempts to create a \"''backronym.''\"\n\nA more detailed view, popularized by [[R. Lee Ermey]] on his television series ''[[Mail Call]]'', disputes this \"slurred GP\" origin, saying that the vehicle was designed for specific duties, and was never referred to as \"General Purpose\" and it is highly unlikely that the average jeep-driving [[GI (term)|GI]] would have been familiar with this designation. The Ford GPW abbreviation actually meant G for government use, P to designate its {{convert|80|in|mm|adj=on}} [[wheelbase]] and W to indicate its Willys-Overland designed engine. Ermey suggests that soldiers at the time were so impressed with the new vehicles that they informally named it after [[Eugene the Jeep]], a character in the ''[[Thimble Theatre]]'' comic strip and cartoons created by [[E. C. Segar]], as early as mid-March 1936. Eugene the Jeep was Popeye's \"jungle pet\" and was \"small, able to move between dimensions and could solve seemingly impossible problems.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/more/372/ |title=Wordorigins.org |publisher=Wordorigins.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref><ref>Borth, Christy.

A precursor of the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] was also referred to as the jeep.<ref name=JTUL/>\n\n''Words of the Fighting Forces'' by Clinton A. Sanders, a dictionary of military slang, published in 1942, in the library at [[The Pentagon]] gives this definition:\n\n:'''Jeep''': A four-wheel drive vehicle of one-half- to one-and-one-half-ton capacity for reconnaissance or other army duty. A term applied to the bantam-cars, and occasionally to other motor vehicles (U.S.A.) in the Air Corps, the Link Trainer; in the armored forces, the \u00bd-ton command vehicle. Also referred to as \"any small plane, helicopter, or gadget.\" \n\nThis definition is supported by the use of the term \"jeep carrier\" to refer to the Navy's small [[escort carrier]]s.\n\nEarly in 1941, [[Willys-Overland]] demonstrated the vehicle's off-road capability by having it drive up the steps of the [[United States Capitol]], driven by Willys test driver Irving \"Red\" Hausmann, who had recently heard soldiers at [[Fort Holabird]] calling it a \"jeep.\" When asked by syndicated columnist Katharine Hillyer for the ''[[Washington Daily News]]'' (or by a bystander, according to another account) what it was called, Hausmann answered, \"It's a jeep.\"\n\nKatharine Hillyer's article was published nationally on February 19, 1941, and included a picture of the vehicle with the caption:\n\n:LAWMAKERS TAKE A RIDE- With Senator [[James M. Mead|Meade]], of New York, at the wheel, and Representative [[J. Parnell Thomas|Thomas]], of New Jersey, sitting beside him, one of the Army's new scout cars, known as \"jeeps\" or \"quads\", climbs up the Capitol steps in a demonstration yesterday. Soldiers in the rear seat for gunners were unperturbed.\n\nAlthough the term was also military slang for vehicles that were untried or untested, this exposure caused all other jeep references to fade, leaving the [[4x4]] with the name.\n\n==Brand, trademarks and image==\n[[File:A jeep's-eye view of the seabees in action - NARA - 513727.jpg|thumb|Willys wartime advertisement promoting its Jeeps' contribution to the war effort]]\nThe \"Jeep\" brand has gone through many owners, starting with [[Willys|Willys-Overland]], which filed the original trademark application for the \"Jeep\" brand-name in February 1943.<ref name=\"Statham\"/> To help establish the term as a Willys brand, the firm campaigned with advertisements emphasizing Willys' prominent contribution to the Jeep that helped win the war.<ref name=\"Statham\">{{cite book|last=Statham|first=Steve|title=Jeep Color History|year=2002|publisher=MBI Publishing|isbn=978-0-7603-0636-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dR3wmKlfnrMC&pg=PA26&dq=Jeep+Generic+trademark|accessdate=28 October 2010|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> Willys' application initially met with years of opposition, primarily from Bantam, but also from [[Minneapolis-Moline]].

The original 9-slot grille associated with all World War II jeeps was designed by Ford for their GPW, and because it weighed less than the original \"Slat Grille\" of Willys (an arrangement of flat bars), was incorporated into the \"standardized jeep\" design.\n\nThe history of the HMMWV ([[Humvee]]) has ties with Jeep. In 1971, Jeep's Defense and Government Products Division was turned into AM General, a wholly owned subsidiary of American Motors Corporation, which also owned Jeep. In 1979, while still owned by American Motors, AM General began the first steps toward designing the Humvee. AM General also continued manufacturing the two-wheel-drive DJ, which Jeep created in 1953. The General Motors [[Hummer]] and Chrysler Jeep have been waging battle in U.S. courts over the right to use seven slots in their respective radiator grilles. Chrysler Jeep claims it has the exclusive rights to use the seven vertical slits since it is the sole remaining assignee of the various companies since Willys gave their postwar jeeps seven slots instead of Ford's nine-slot design for the Jeep.\n\n===Off-road abilities===\n[[File:Rockcrawling.JPG|thumb|right|Jeep Wrangler off-roading.]]\nJeep advertising has always emphasized the brand's vehicles' off-road capabilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.top100.biz/shopping/Toledo-built-Jeeps-sales-results-abroad-mirror-those-in-North-American-market/ |title=Toledo-built Jeeps' sales results abroad mirror those in North American market |publisher=News.top100.biz |date=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2010-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706145841/http://news.top100.biz/shopping/Toledo-built-Jeeps-sales-results-abroad-mirror-those-in-North-American-market/ |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}</ref> Today, the [[Jeep Wrangler|Wrangler]] is one of the few remaining four-wheel-drive vehicles with solid front and rear axles. These axles are known for their durability, strength, and articulation. New Wranglers come with a [[Dana 44]] rear [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] and a [[Dana 30]] front differential. The upgraded Rubicon model of the JK Wrangler is equipped with electronically activated locking differentials, [[Dana 44]] axles front and rear with 4.10 gears, a 4:1 [[transfer case]], electronic [[sway bar]] disconnect and heavy duty suspension.\n\nAnother benefit of solid axle vehicles is they tend to be easier and cheaper to \"lift\" with aftermarket suspension systems. This increases the distance between the axle and chassis of the vehicle. By increasing this distance, larger tires can be installed, which will increase the [[ground clearance]], allowing it to traverse even larger and more difficult obstacles. In addition to higher ground clearance, many owners aim to increase suspension articulation or \"flex\" to give their Jeeps greatly improved off-road capabilities. Good suspension articulation keeps all four wheels in contact with the ground and maintains traction.\n\nUseful features of the smaller Jeeps are their short wheelbases, narrow frames, and ample [[approach angle|approach]], [[breakover angle|breakover]], and departure angles, allowing them to fit into places where full-size four-wheel drives have difficulty.\n\n==Company history and ownership==\nAfter the war, Willys did not resume production of its passenger-car models, choosing instead to concentrate on Jeeps and Jeep-branded vehicles, launching the [[Willys Jeep Station Wagon|Jeep Station Wagon]] in 1946, the [[Willys Jeep Truck|Jeep Truck]] in 1947, and the [[Willys-Overland Jeepster|Jeepster]] in 1948. An attempt to re-enter the passenger-car market in 1952 with the [[Willys Aero]] sedan proved unsuccessful, and ended with the company\u2019s acquisition by [[Kaiser Motors]] in 1953, for $60 million.<ref name=Cranswick2>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=r9j7MWLE_jMC&pg=PA241&lpg=PA241&dq=1972+cj-5+nose&source=bl&ots=tUrD5PeDip&sig=LbSTN4Sggq3bTVzuzxFl3cgocqw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwichfjsg7LYAhWGmLQKHXwfBPg4ChDoAQhfMAk#v=onepage&q=1972%20cj-5%20nose&f=false |pages=239\u2013240 |title=Cars of American Motors: An Illustrated History |first=Marc |last=Cranswick |publisher=McFarland|year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7864-4672-8 |accessdate=11 June 2012}}</ref> Kaiser initially called the merged company \"Willys Motors\", but renamed itself [[Kaiser Jeep|Kaiser-Jeep]] in 1963.

This time $70 million changed hands.<ref name=Cranswick2/> The utility vehicles complemented AMC's passenger car business by sharing components, achieving volume efficiencies, as well as capitalizing on Jeep's international and government markets. In 1971 AMC spun off Jeep's commercial, postal and military vehicle lines into a separate subsidiary, AM General \u2013 the company that later developed the M998 Humvee. In 1976 Jeep introduced the CJ-7, replacing the CJ-6 in North America, as well as crossing 100,000 civilian units in annual global sales for the first time.<ref name=AutoWeekYears>[http://autoweek.com/article/car-life/year-year-breakdown-jeeps-climb-top Jeep's climb to the top: A year-by-year history \u2013 Autoweek]</ref>\n\nThe French automaker [[Renault]] began investing in AMC in 1979. During this period Jeep introduced the XJ Cherokee, its first unibody SUV; and global sales top 200,000 for the first time in 1985.<ref name=AutoWeekYears/> However, the replacement of the CJ Jeeps by the new Wrangler line in 1986 marked the start of a different era. By 1987, the automobile markets had changed and Renault itself was experiencing financial troubles.\n\nAt the same time, [[Chrysler Corporation]] wanted to capture the Jeep brand, as well as other assets of AMC. So Chrysler bought out AMC in 1987, shortly after the Jeep [[CJ-7]] had been replaced with the AMC-designed [[Jeep Wrangler#YJ (1986\u20131995)|Wrangler YJ]]. After more than 40 years, the four-wheel drive utility vehicles brand that had been a profitable niche for smaller automakers, fell into the hands of one of the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]; and Jeep was the only AMC brand continued by Chrysler after the acquisition. But Chrysler subsequently merged with [[Daimler-Benz]] in 1998 and folded into [[DaimlerChrysler]].

Spanning {{convert|10,990|sqkm|sqmi}} in area, it is the third-largest island of the [[Greater Antilles]] and the fourth-largest island country in the [[Caribbean]]. Jamaica lies about {{convert|145|km|mi}} south of [[Cuba]], and {{convert|191|km|mi}} west of [[Hispaniola]] (the island containing the countries of [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]).\n\nPreviously inhabited by the indigenous [[Arawak]] and [[Ta\u00edno]] peoples, the island came under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] following the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1494. Many of the indigenous people died of disease, and the Spanish transplanted African slaves to Jamaica as labourers. The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England (later [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]) conquered it and renamed it Jamaica. Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with its plantation economy highly dependent on African slaves. The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farms]] rather than to work on plantations. Beginning in the 1840s, the British utilized Chinese and Indian [[indentured]] labour to work on plantations. The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962.\n\nWith {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Jamaica}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million people,{{UN_Population|ref}} Jamaica is the third-most populous [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] country in the [[Americas]] (after the United States and Canada), and the fourth-most populous country in the Caribbean. [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] is the country's capital and largest city, with a population of 937,700. [[Jamaicans]] mainly have African ancestry, with significant [[European Jamaicans|European]], [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaican|Indian]], [[Lebanese Jamaicans|Lebanese]], and mixed-race minorities. Due to a high rate of emigration for work since the 1960s, Jamaica has a [[Jamaican diaspora|large diaspora]] around the world, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nJamaica is a [[Commonwealth realm]], with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as [[Monarchy of Jamaica|its monarch]] and [[head of state]]. Her appointed representative in the country is the [[Governor-General of Jamaica]], an office held by [[Patrick Allen (Governor-General)|Sir Patrick Allen]] since 2009. [[Andrew Holness]] has served as the [[head of government]] and [[Prime Minister of Jamaica]] from March 2016. Jamaica is a parliamentary [[constitutional monarchy]] with legislative power vested in the bicameral [[Parliament of Jamaica]], consisting of an appointed Senate and a directly elected House of Representatives.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[indigenous people]], the [[Ta\u00edno]], called the island ''Xaymaca'' in [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]],<ref>As represented in [[Spanish orthography#Orthography|Old Spanish orthography]], meaning it began with a \"[[\u0283|sh]]\" sound.</ref> meaning the \"Land of Wood and Water\" or the \"Land of Springs\".<ref name=taino>{{cite web|url=http://www.uctp.org/VocesIndigena.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016055722/http://www.uctp.org/VocesIndigena.html |archivedate=16 October 2007 |title= Ta\u00edno Dictionary |publisher= The United Confederation of Ta\u00edno People |accessdate=18 October 2007|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nColloquially Jamaicans refer to their home island as the \"Rock.\" Slang names such as \"Jamrock\", \"Jamdown\" (\"Jamdung\" in [[Jamaican Patois]]), or briefly \"Ja\", have derived from this.<ref>as known from the songs \"Roots, Rock, Reggae\" by Bob Marley (\"roots\" referring to Africa, while \"rock\" means Jamaica), \"Jahman inna Jamdown\" by Peter Tosh, and \"[[Welcome to Jamrock (song)|Welcome to Jamrock]]\" by Damian Marley</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Jamaica}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{Main|Pre-Columbian Jamaica}}\nThe [[Arawak]] and [[Ta\u00edno]] indigenous people, originating in [[South America]], settled on the island between 4000 and 1000 BC.<ref name=\"primearticles1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicans.com/articles/primearticles/taino.shtml |title=The Taino of Jamaica (Jamaica) |publisher=Jamaicans.com |date=1 April 2001 |accessdate=4 July 2009}}</ref> When [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in 1494, there were more than 200 villages ruled by ''caciques'' (chiefs of villages).

They were brought in as indentured labourers and soldiers after the conquest of Jamaica by Cromwell's forces in 1655.

Some Spanish and Portuguese Jewish refugees went to the Netherlands and England, and from there to Jamaica. Others were part of the Iberian colonisation of the New World, after overtly converting to Catholicism, as only Catholics were allowed in the Spanish colonies. By 1660, Jamaica had become a refuge for Jews in the New World, also attracting those who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal.\n\nAn early group of Jews arrived in 1510, soon after the son of Christopher Columbus settled on the island. Primarily working as merchants and traders, the Jewish community was forced to live a clandestine life, calling themselves \"Portugals\". After the British took over rule of Jamaica, the Jews decided the best defense against Spain's regaining control was to encourage making the colony a base for Caribbean pirates. With the pirates installed in [[Port Royal]], which became the largest city in the Caribbean, the Spanish would be deterred from attacking. The British leaders agreed with the viability of this strategy to forestall outside aggression.<ref>\nKritzler, Edward, ''The Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean,'' Anchor, 2009, p. 15, {{ISBN|0767919521}}</ref>\n\nWhen the English captured Jamaica in 1655, the Spanish colonists fled after freeing their slaves.<ref name=\"jamsenghist\"/> The slaves dispersed into the mountains, joining the ''[[maroon (people)|maroons]],'' those who had previously escaped to live with the [[Ta\u00edno]] native people.<ref name=\"maroons\">{{cite web|last=Benitez|first=Suzette|title=The Maroons|url=http://scholar.library.miami.edu/slaves/Maroons/individual_essays/suzette1.html|accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref> During the centuries of slavery, Maroons established free communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica, where they maintained their freedom and independence for generations. The [[Jamaican Maroons]] fought the British during the 18th century. Under treaties of 1738 and 1739, the British agreed to stop trying to round them up in exchange for their leaving the colonial settlements alone, but serving if needed for military actions.<ref name=\"maroons\"/> Some of the communities were broken up and the British deported Maroons to [[Nova Scotia]] and, later, [[Sierra Leone]]. The name is still used today by modern Maroon descendants, who have certain rights and autonomy at the community of [[Accompong]].\n\nDuring its first 200 years of British rule, Jamaica became one of the world's leading [[sugar]]-exporting, slave-dependent colonies, producing more than 77,000 tons of sugar annually between 1820 and 1824. After the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolition of the international slave trade]] in 1807,<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/caribbean-islands/8.htm The Sugar Revolutions and Slavery], ''U.S. Library of Congress''</ref> the British began to \"import\" [[indentured servant]]s to supplement the labour pool, as many freedmen resisted working on the plantations.

R. Ellis, Esq. M.P., c. 1820]]\nBy the beginning of the 19th century, Jamaica's dependence on slave labour and a plantation economy had resulted in black people outnumbering white people by a ratio of almost 20 to 1. Although the UK had outlawed the importation of slaves, some were still smuggled in from Spanish colonies and directly. While planning the abolition of slavery, the British Parliament passed laws to improve conditions for slaves. They banned the use of whips in the field and flogging of women; informed planters that slaves were to be allowed religious instruction, and required a free day during each week when slaves could sell their produce,<ref>''History of the Catholic Church in Jamaica'' {{ISBN|978-0-829-40544-6}} p. 68</ref> prohibiting Sunday markets to enable slaves to attend church.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe House of Assembly in Jamaica resented and resisted the new laws. Members (then restricted to European-Jamaicans) claimed that the slaves were content and objected to Parliament's interference in island affairs. Slave owners feared possible revolts if conditions were lightened. Following a series of rebellions on the island and changing attitudes in Great Britain, the British government formally abolished slavery by an 1833 act, beginning in 1834, with full [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation]] from chattel slavery declared in 1838. The population in 1834 was 371,070, of whom 15,000 were white, 5,000 free black; 40,000 'coloured' or [[free people of color]] ([[mixed race]]); and 311,070 were slaves.<ref name=\"population\"/>\n\nIn the 19th century, the British established a number of [[botanical gardens]]. These included the [[Castleton Botanical Gardens]], developed in 1862 to replace the [[Bath, Jamaica|Bath Botanical Gardens]] (created in 1779) which was subject to flooding. [[Bath, Jamaica|Bath Botanical Gardens]] was the site for planting [[breadfruit]], brought to Jamaica from the Pacific by Captain [[William Bligh]]. It became a staple in island diets. Other gardens were the [[Cinchona]] [[Plantation]], founded in 1868, and the [[Hope Botanical Gardens]] founded in 1874. In 1872, [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] was designated as the island's capital.\n\nIn 1945, [[Horace Hearne|Sir Horace Hector Hearne]] became [[Chief Justice]] and Keeper of the Records in Jamaica. He headed the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]], Kingston between 1945 and 1950/1951. After [[Kenya]] achieved independence, its government appointed him as Chief Justice and he moved there.\n\n===Independence (1962)===\n{{Main|Independence of Jamaica}}\n[[File:Charles Camilla Jamaica 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prince Charles]] and the [[Duchess of Cornwall]] during a visit to Jamaica in 2008]]\n\nJamaica slowly gained increasing independence from the United Kingdom. In 1958, it became a province in the [[Federation of the West Indies]], a federation among the [[British West Indies]]. Jamaica attained full independence by leaving the federation in 1962.\n\nStrong economic growth, averaging approximately 6% per annum, marked the first ten years of independence under conservative [[Jamaica Labour Party]] governments; they were led successively by Prime Ministers [[Alexander Bustamante]], [[Donald Sangster]] and [[Hugh Shearer]]. The growth was fueled by strong private investments in [[bauxite]]/alumina, [[tourism]], the manufacturing industry and, to a lesser extent, the agricultural sector.\n\nThe optimism of the first decade was accompanied by a growing sense of inequality among many Afro-Jamaicans, and a concern that the benefits of growth were not being shared by the urban poor.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Combined with the effects of a slowdown in the global economy in 1970,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} the voters elected the PNP ([[People's National Party]]) in 1972. They tried to implement more socially equitable policies in education and health, but the economy suffered under their leadership. By 1980, Jamaica's gross national product had declined to some 25% below the 1972 level. Due to rising foreign and local debt, accompanied by large fiscal deficits, the government sought [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) financing from the United States and others.\n\nEconomic deterioration continued into the mid-1980s, exacerbated by a number of factors. The first and third largest alumina producers, [[Alpart]] and [[Alcoa]], closed, and there was a significant reduction in production by the second-largest producer, [[Alcan]]. Reynolds Jamaica Mines, Ltd. left the Jamaican industry. There was also a decline in tourism, which was important to the economy.\n\nIndependence, however widely celebrated in Jamaica, has been questioned in the early 21st century. In 2011, a survey showed that approximately 60% of Jamaicans believe that the country would be better off had it remained a British colony with only 17% believing it would be worse off, citing as problems years of social and fiscal mismanagement in the country.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20110628/lead/lead1.html |title=Give Us The Queen! |date=28 June 2011 |work=The Gleaner|publisher=[[Gleaner Company]] |accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/most-jamaicans-would-prefer-remain-british-294753 |title=Most Jamaicans Would Prefer To Remain British |last=Ghosh |first=Palash |date=29 June 2011 |accessdate=13 February 2017 |publisher=[[International Business Times]] }}</ref>\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Jamaica}}\n{{Further|Foreign relations of Jamaica|Republicanism in Jamaica}}\n[[File:Parliament.jm.jpg|thumb|Inside the [[Parliament of Jamaica|Jamaican Parliament]] ]]\n\nJamaica is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]], with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] serving as the [[Monarchy of Jamaica|Jamaican monarch]].<ref>Queen of Jamaica http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Jamaica/Jamaica.aspx</ref> As Elizabeth II is shared as [[head of state]] of [[Commonwealth realm|fifteen other countries]] and resides mostly in the United Kingdom, she is thus often represented as Queen of Jamaica in Jamaica and abroad by the [[Governor-General of Jamaica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4923.asp |title=The Monarchy Today: Queen and Commonwealth |accessdate=25 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607011458/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4923.asp |archivedate=7 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe governor-general is nominated by the [[Prime Minister of Jamaica]] and the entire Cabinet and appointed by the monarch. All the members of the Cabinet are appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the prime minister. The monarch and the governor-general serve largely ceremonial roles, apart from their [[reserve power]]s for use in certain constitutional crisis situations.\n\nJamaica's current [[constitution]] was drafted in 1962 by a bipartisan joint committee of the Jamaican legislature. It came into force with the Jamaica Independence Act, 1962 of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom parliament]], which gave Jamaica independence.\n\nThe [[Parliament of Jamaica]] is [[Bicameralism|bicameral]], consisting of the House of Representatives (Lower House) and the Senate (Upper House). Members of the House (known as Members of Parliament or ''MPs'') are directly elected, and the member of the House of Representatives who, in the governor-general's best judgement, is best able to command the confidence of a majority of the members of that House, is appointed by the governor-general to be the prime minister. Senators are nominated jointly by the prime minister and the parliamentary [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]] and are then appointed by the governor-general.\n\n===Political parties and elections===\nJamaica has traditionally had a [[two-party system]], with power often alternating between the [[People's National Party]] (PNP) and [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP). The party with current administrative and legislative power is the Jamaica Labour Party, with a one-seat parliamentary majority {{As of|2016|lc=y}}. There are also several minor parties who have yet to gain a seat in parliament; the largest of these is the [[National Democratic Movement (Jamaica)|National Democratic Movement]] (NDM).\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{Main|Parishes of Jamaica}}\n\nJamaica is divided into 14 [[Parishes of Jamaica|parishes]], which are grouped into three historic [[county|counties]] that have no administrative relevance.\n\nIn the context of [[local government]] the parishes are designated \"Local Authorities.\" These local authorities are further styled as \"Municipal Corporations,\" which are either city municipalities or town municipalities.<ref name=\"localgovernemtn\">{{cite web|title=Local Government Act, 2015|url=http://www.localauthorities.gov.jm/sites/default/files/resources/local_governance_bill_2015.pdf|website=localauthorities.gov.jm |accessdate=17 January 2018}}</ref> Any new city municipality must have a population of at least 50,000, and a town municipality a number set by the Minister of Local Government.<ref name=\"localgovernemtn\"/> There are currently no town municipalities.\n\nThe local governments of the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrews are consolidated as the city municipality of Kingston & St. Andrew Municipal Corporation. The newest city municipality created is the Municipality of Portmore in 2003.

The JDF is based on the British military model with similar organisation, training, weapons and traditions. Once chosen, officer candidates are sent to one of several British or Canadian basic officer courses depending on the arm of service. Enlisted soldiers are given basic training at Up Park Camp or JDF Training Depot, Newcastle, both in St. Andrew. As with the British model, NCOs are given several levels of professional training as they rise up the ranks. Additional military schools are available for speciality training in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe JDF is directly descended from the British Army's [[West India Regiment]] formed during the colonial era.<ref name=\"jdfhistory\">{{cite web|title=Jamaica Defense Force History|url=http://www.jdfmil.org/overview/background/background2.php|publisher=Jamaica Defense Force|accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> The West India Regiment was used extensively by the British Empire in policing the empire from 1795 to 1926. Other units in the JDF heritage include the early colonial Jamaica Militia, the Kingston Infantry Volunteers of WWI and reorganised into the Jamaican Infantry Volunteers in World War II. The West Indies Regiment was reformed in 1958 as part of the [[West Indies Federation]], after dissolution of the Federation the JDF was established.\n\nThe Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) comprises an [[The Jamaica Regiment|infantry Regiment]] and Reserve Corps, an Air Wing, a Coast Guard fleet and a supporting Engineering Unit.<ref name=\"JDFstructure\">{{cite web|title=Jamaica Defense Force General Information|url=http://www.jdfmil.org/overview/background/background3.php|publisher=Jamaica Defense Force |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> The infantry regiment contains the 1st, 2nd and 3rd (National Reserve) battalions.

JDF units actively conduct armed patrols with the JCF in high-crime areas and known gang neighbourhoods. There has been vocal controversy as well as support of this JDF role. In early 2005, an Opposition leader, [[Edward Seaga]], called for the merger of the JDF and JCF. This has not garnered support in either organisation nor among the majority of citizens.\n\n==Geography and environment==\n{{Main|Geography of Jamaica}}\n[[File:Doctors-Cave-Beach.jpg|thumb|[[Doctor's Cave Beach Club]] is a popular destination in [[Montego Bay]].]]\n[[File:Start of the Blue Mountains just north of Kingston, Jamaica.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|[[Blue Mountains (Jamaica)|Blue Mountains]]]]\n[[File:Dunns River Falls Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|The picturesque [[Dunn's River Falls]] in [[Ocho R\u00edos]]]]\n\nJamaica is the third largest island in the [[Caribbean]].<ref name=\"jamaica background\">{{cite web|title=County Background \u2013 Jamaica|url=http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsana/e/fulltext/perfiles/jamaica.pdf|publisher=Pan American Health Organization|accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref> It lies between latitudes [[17th parallel north|17\u00b0]] and [[19th parallel north|19\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[76th meridian west|76\u00b0]] and [[79th meridian west|79\u00b0W]].

The authorities have recognised the tremendous significance and potential of the environment and have designated some of the more 'fertile' areas as 'protected'. Among the island's protected areas are the [[Cockpit Country]], [[Jamaican dry forests|Hellshire Hills]], and Litchfield forest reserves. In 1992, Jamaica's first marine park, covering nearly {{convert|15|km2|sqmi}}, was established in [[Montego Bay]].

When the Spanish arrived in 1494, except for small agricultural clearings, the country was deeply forested. The European settlers cut down the great timber trees for building and ships' supplies, and cleared the plains, savannas, and mountain slopes for intense agricultural cultivation. Many new plants were introduced including sugarcane, bananas, and citrus trees.\n\nAreas of heavy rainfall contain stands of bamboo, ferns, ebony, mahogany, and rosewood. Cactus and similar dry-area plants are found along the south and southwest coastal area. Parts of the west and southwest consist of large grasslands, with scattered stands of trees.\n\nThe Jamaican animal life, typical of the [[Caribbean]], includes highly diversified wildlife with many endemic species found nowhere else on earth. As with other oceanic islands, land mammals are mostly [[bat]]s. The only non-bat native mammal extant in Jamaica is the [[Jamaican hutia]], locally known as the coney. Introduced mammals such as [[wild boar]] and the [[small Asian mongoose]] are also common. Jamaica is also home to about 50 species of reptiles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reptile-database.org|title=THE REPTILE DATABASE|work=reptile-database.org}}</ref> the largest of which is the [[American crocodile]]; however, it is only present within the Black River and a few other areas. Lizards such as [[anole]]s, [[iguana]]s and snakes such as racers and the [[Jamaican boa]] (the largest snake on the island), are common in areas such as the Cockpit Country. None of Jamaica's eight species of native snakes is venomous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cockpitcountry.com/Amphibians%20%26%20Reptiles.html |title=Amphibians and reptiles found in Cockpit Country jamaica |publisher=Cockpitcountry.com |date= |accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nJamaica is the indigenous home of two species of [[hummingbird]]s, the [[Black-billed streamertail|black-billed]] and [[red-billed streamertail]]s.

It is found only on Jamaica, [[Cat Island (Bahamas)|Cat Island]], and a few other islands in [[the Bahamas]]. In addition, many types of frogs are common on the island, especially [[treefrog]]s. Birds are abundant, and make up the bulk of the endemic and native vertebrate species. Beautiful and exotic birds, such as the [[Jamaican tody]] and the [[doctor bird]] (the national bird), can be found among a large number of others.\n\nJamaican waters contain considerable resources of fresh-and saltwater fish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fishbase.org/Country/CountryChecklist.php?c_code=388&vhabitat=all2&csub_code=|title=All fishes reported from Jamaica|work=fishbase.org}}</ref> The chief varieties of saltwater fish are [[King mackerel|kingfish]], [[Carangidae|jack]], [[mackerel]], [[Whiting (fish)|whiting]], [[bonito]], and [[tuna]].

The musical genres [[reggae]], [[ska]], [[mento]], [[rocksteady]], [[Dub music|dub]], and, more recently, [[dancehall]] and [[ragga]] all originated in the island's vibrant, popular urban recording industry. Jamaica also played an important role in the development of [[punk rock]], through reggae and ska. Reggae has also influenced American [[Hip hop music|rap]] music, as they share roots as rhythmic, African styles of music. Some rappers, such as [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Heavy D]], are of Jamaican descent. Internationally known reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] was also Jamaican.\n\nMany other internationally known artists were born in Jamaica, including [[Millie Small]], [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]], [[Gregory Isaacs]], [[Half Pint]], [[Protoje]], [[Peter Tosh]], [[Bunny Wailer]], [[Big Youth]], [[Jimmy Cliff]], [[Dennis Brown]], [[Desmond Dekker]], [[Beres Hammond]], [[Beenie Man]], [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Shabba Ranks]], [[Super Cat]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Sean Paul]], [[I Wayne]], [[Bounty Killer]] and many others. Bands that came from Jamaica include [[Black Uhuru]], [[Third World Band]], [[Inner Circle (reggae band)|Inner Circle]], [[Chalice Reggae Band]], [[Culture (band)|Culture]], Fab Five and [[Morgan Heritage]]. The genre [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]] emerged from London's Jamaican diaspora. The birth of [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] in New York City owed much to the city's Jamaican community.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Jamaican literature}}\n\nThe journalist and author [[H. G. de Lisser]] (1878\u20131944) used his native country as the setting for his many novels. Born in [[Falmouth, Jamaica]], de Lisser worked as a reporter for the ''[[Jamaica Times]]'' at a young age and in 1920 began publishing the magazine ''[[Planters' Punch]]''. ''The White Witch of Rosehall'' is one of his better-known novels. He was named Honorary President of the Jamaican Press Association; he worked throughout his professional career to promote the Jamaican sugar industry.\n\n[[Roger Mais]] (1905 \u2013 1955), a journalist, poet, and playwright wrote many short stories, plays, and novels, including ''The Hills Were Joyful Together'' (1953), ''Brother Man'' (1954), and ''Black Lightning'' (1955).\n\n[[Ian Fleming]] (1908-1964), who had a home in Jamaica where he spent considerable time, repeatedly used the island as a setting in his [[James Bond]] novels, including ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'', ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Doctor No]]'', \"[[For Your Eyes Only (short story)|For Your Eyes Only]]\", ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', and ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]''. In addition, James Bond uses a Jamaica-based cover in ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''.

Major sectors of the Jamaican economy include [[agriculture]], [[mining]], [[manufacturing]], [[tourism]], and [[financial]] and [[insurance]] services. Tourism and mining are the leading earners of [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]]. Half the Jamaican economy relies on services, with half of its income coming from services such as tourism. An estimated 1.3 million foreign tourists visit Jamaica every year.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/11/1057783358449.html Sex tourism as economic aid]. Smh.com.au. 12 July 2003.</ref>\n\nSupported by multilateral financial institutions, Jamaica has, since the early 1980s, sought to implement structural reforms aimed at fostering private sector activity and increasing the role of market forces in resource allocation. Since 1991, the government has followed a programme of economic liberalisation and stabilisation by removing exchange controls, floating the exchange rate, cutting [[tariff]]s, stabilising the Jamaican currency, reducing [[inflation]] and removing restrictions on [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]]. Emphasis has been placed on maintaining strict fiscal discipline, greater openness to trade and financial flows, market liberalisation and reduction in the size of government. During this period, a large share of the economy was returned to private sector ownership through [[divestment]] and privatisation programmes.\n\nThe macroeconomic stabilisation programme introduced in 1991, which focused on tight fiscal and monetary policies, has contributed to a controlled reduction in the rate of inflation. The annual inflation rate decreased from a high of 80.2% in 1991 to 7.9% in 1998. Inflation for FY1998/99 was 6.2% compared to 7.2% in the corresponding period in CUU1997/98. The [[Government of Jamaica]] remains committed to lowering inflation, with a long-term objective of bringing it in line with that of its major trading partners.\n\nAfter a period of steady growth from 1985 to 1995, real [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] decreased by 1.8% and 2.4% in 1996 and 1997, respectively. The decrease in GDP in 1996 and 1997 was largely due to significant problems in the financial sector and, in 1997, a severe island-wide drought (the worst in 70 years) that drastically reduced agricultural production. In 1997, nominal GDP was approximately J$220,556.2&nbsp;million (US$6,198.9&nbsp;million based on the average annual exchange rate of the period).\n\n[[File:Alligator pond Jamaica fishing boats gm.jpg|thumb|Fishing boats and [[bauxite]] [[cargo ship]]s share the waterways near [[Alligator Pond]].]]\n\nThe economy in 1997 was marked by low levels of [[import]] growth, high levels of private capital inflows and relative stability in the [[foreign exchange market]].\n\nRecent economic performance shows the Jamaican economy is recovering. [[Agricultural]] production, an important engine of growth increased 15.3% in third quarter of 1998 compared to the corresponding period in 1997, signaling the first positive growth rate in the sector since January 1997. [[Bauxite]] and [[alumina]] production increased 5.5% from January to December 1998, compared to the corresponding period in 1997.

Early inhabitants of Jamaica named the land \"Xaymaca\", meaning \"Land of wood and water\". The Spanish enslaved the Tainos, who were so ravaged by their conflict with the Europeans and by [[Virgin soil epidemic|foreign diseases]] that nearly the entire native population was extinct by 1600.  The Spanish also seized, terrorized, and transported hundreds of West Africans to the island where they subsequently enslaved them.\n\nIn the year 1655, the [[Invasion of Jamaica (1655)|English invaded Jamaica]], defeating the Spanish colonists.  Enslaved Africans seized the moment of political turmoil and fled to the island's interior, forming independent communities (known as the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]]).  Meanwhile, on the coast, the English built the settlement of [[Port Royal]], which became a base of operations for pirates and [[privateer]]s, including Captain [[Henry Morgan]].\n\nIn the 18th century, [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar cane]] replaced [[Piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]] as British Jamaica's main source of income.  The sugar industry was labour-intensive and the British brought hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans to Jamaica, so that by 1800 black Jamaicans outnumbered whites by a ratio of twenty to one.  Enslaved Jamaicans mounted over a dozen major uprisings during the 18th century, including [[Tacky's revolt]] in 1760.  There were also periodic skirmishes between the British and the mountain communities, culminating in the [[First Maroon War]] of the 1730s and the [[Second Maroon War]] of the 1790s.\n\n== Pre-Columbian Jamaica ==\n{{Main|Pre-Columbian Jamaica}}\nThe first inhabitants of Jamaica probably came from islands to the east in two waves of migration. About 600 CE the culture known as the \u201cRedware people\u201d arrived; little is known of them, however, beyond the red pottery they left.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">[https://www.britannica.com/place/Jamaica/History \"Jamaica\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.</ref> Alligator Pond in [[Manchester Parish]] and Little River in [[St. Ann Parish]] are among the earliest known sites of this Ostionoid people, who lived near the coast and extensively hunted turtles and fish.<ref>Atkinson, Lesley-Gail. \"The Earliest Inhabitants: The Dynamics of the Jamaican Ta\u00edno.\"</ref>\n\nAround 800 CE, [[Arawakan]]-speaking [[Ta\u00edno]] arrived, eventually settling throughout the island. Living in villages ruled by tribal chiefs called [[cacique]]s, they sustained themselves on fishing and the cultivation of [[maize]] and [[cassava]]. At the height of their civilisation, their population is estimated to have numbered as much as 60,000.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\nThe Ta\u00edno brought from South America a system of raising [[yuca]] known as \"conuco.\"<ref name=rogozinski>Rogozinski, Jan.  \"A Brief History of the Caribbean.\"</ref>  To add nutrients to the soil, the Ta\u00edno burned local bushes and trees and heaped the ash into large mounds, into which they then planted yuca cuttings.<ref name=rogozinski /> Most Ta\u00edno lived in large circular buildings (''bohios''), constructed with wooden poles, woven straw, and [[Palm tree|palm]] leaves.  The Taino spoke an [[Arawakan language]] and did not have writing. Some of the words used by them, such as ''barbacoa'' (\"barbecue\"), ''hamaca'' (\"hammock\"), ''kanoa'' (\"canoe\"), ''tabaco'' (\"tobacco\"), ''[[cassava|yuca]]'', ''batata'' (\"sweet potato\"), and ''[[jurac\u00e1n]]'' (\"hurricane\"), have been incorporated into Spanish and English.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Manihot esculenta dsc07325.jpg|Cassava (''yuca'') roots, the Ta\u00ednos' main crop\nFile:Duho.jpg|''Dujo'', a wooden chair crafted by Ta\u00ednos.\nFile:Reconstruction of Taino village, Cuba.JPG|Reconstruction of a Ta\u00edno village in Cuba\nFile:Parco Cerimoniale Indigeno di Caguana.jpg|Caguana Ceremonial ball court (''batey''), outlined with stones\n</gallery>\n\n== The Spanish colonial period (1494\u20131655) ==\n{{Main|Spanish Jamaica}}\n\n[[Christopher Columbus]] is believed to be the first European to reach Jamaica.  He landed on the island on 5 May 1494, during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|second voyage]] to the Americas.<ref>[http://www.christopher-columbus.eu/voyage-2.htm \"Christopher Columbus \u2013 2nd Voyage\".]</ref> Columbus returned to Jamaica during his fourth voyage to the Americas.  He had been sailing around the Caribbean nearly a year when a storm beached his ships in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]], on 25 June 1503.  For a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on the island, finally departing in June 1504.\n\nThe Spanish crown granted the island to the Columbus family, but for decades it was something of a backwater, valued chiefly as a supply base for food and animal hides.  In 1509 [[Juan de Esquivel]] founded the first permanent European settlement, the town of [[Sevilla la Nueva (Jamaica)|Sevilla la Nueva]] (New Seville), on the north coast. A decade later, Friar [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] wrote Spanish authorities about Esquivel's conduct during the Hig\u00fcey massacre of 1503.\n\nIn 1534 the capital was moved to [[Villa de la Vega]] (later [[Santiago de la Vega]]), now called [[Spanish Town]].  This settlement served as the capital of both Spanish and English [[Jamaica]], from its founding in 1534 until 1872, after which the capital was moved to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]].\n\nThe Spanish enslaved many of the Taino; some escaped, but most died from European diseases and overwork. The Spaniards also introduced the first African slaves. By the early 17th century, when virtually no Taino remained in the region, the population of the island was about 3,000, including a small number of African slaves.<ref name=discja>{{cite web|title=JAMAICAN HISTORY I |url=http://www.discoverjamaica.com/gleaner/discover/geography/history1.htm |publisher=Discover Jamaica |accessdate=23 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805083846/http://www.discoverjamaica.com/gleaner/discover/geography/history1.htm |archivedate=5 August 2013 |df= }}</ref> Disappointed in the lack of gold on the isle, the Spanish mainly used Jamaica as a [[military base]] to supply colonising efforts in the mainland Americas.<ref name=jam2>{{cite web|title=Brief History of Jamaica|url=http://jamaicans.com/info/brief.htm|publisher=Jamaicans.com|accessdate=23 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish colonists did not bring women in the first expeditions and took Ta\u00edno women for their common-law wives, resulting in [[mestizo]] children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Guitar|first=Lynne|title=Criollos: The Birth of a Dynamic New Indo-Afro-European People and Culture on Hispaniola.|url=http://www.kacike.org/LynneGuitar.html|work=KACIKE: Journal of Caribbean Amerindian History and Anthropology|accessdate=27 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202053219/http://www.kacike.org/LynneGuitar.html |archivedate=2 December 2008}}</ref>  Sexual violence with the Ta\u00edno women by the Spanish was also common.{{sfn|L\u00e9ger|1907|p=23}}{{sfn|Accilien et al.|2003|p=12}}\n\nAlthough the Taino referred to the island as \"Xaymaca,\" the Spanish gradually changed the name to \"Jamaica.\"<ref name=Cundall>Cundall, Frank.  \"The Story of the Life of Columbus and the Discovery of Jamaica.\"</ref>  In the so-called Admiral's map of 1507 the island was labeled as \"Jamaiqua\" and in Peter Martyr's work \"Decades\" of 1511, he referred to it as both \"Jamaica\" and \"Jamica\".<ref name=Cundall />\n\n== British rule (1655\u20131962) ==\n{{Main|English Jamaica}}\n\n=== 17th century ===\n====English conquest====\n[[File:Old Port Royal - Project Gutenberg eText 19396.png|thumb|right|An illustration of pre-1692 Port Royal]]\n{{Main|Invasion of Jamaica}}\n\nIn late 1654, English leader [[Oliver Cromwell]] launched the ''Western Design'' armada against [[Spanish West Indies|Spain's colonies in the Caribbean]].

After the Spanish repulsed this poorly-executed attack, the English force then sailed for Jamaica, the only Spanish West Indies island that did not have new defensive works. In May 1655, around 7,000 English soldiers landed near Jamaica's [[Spanish Town]] capital and soon overwhelmed the small number of Spanish troops (at the time, Jamaica's entire population only numbered around 2,500).<ref>*{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Matthew |date=2011 |title=The Sugar Barons}}</ref>  Spain never recaptured Jamaica, losing the [[Battle of Ocho Rios (1657)|Battle of Ocho Rios]] in 1657 and the [[Battle of Rio Nuevo (1658)|Battle of Rio Nuevo]] in 1658.

Due to the wars in Ireland at this time two-thirds of this 17th-century European population was Irish.  But [[tropical diseases]] kept the number of Europeans under 10,000 until about 1740.  Although the African slave population in the 1670s and 1680s never exceeded 10,000, by the end of the 17th century [[Slave trade|imports]] of [[slave]]s increased the [[Jamaicans of African ancestry|black population]] to at least five times the number of whites. Thereafter, Jamaica's African population did not increase significantly in number until well into the 18th century, in part because ships coming from the west coast of [[Africa]] preferred to unload at the islands of the [[Eastern Caribbean]]. At the beginning of the 18th century, the number of slaves in Jamaica did not exceed 45,000, but by 1800 it had increased to over 300,000.\n\n====The House of Assembly====\n{{Main|House of Assembly of Jamaica}}\nBeginning with the [[House of Stuart|Stuart monarchy]]'s appointment of a civil [[Governor of Jamaica|governor to Jamaica]] in 1661, political patterns were established that lasted well into the 20th century. The second governor, [[Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 1st Earl of Plymouth|Lord Windsor]], brought with him in 1662 a proclamation from the king giving Jamaica's non-slave populace the rights of English citizens, including the right to make their own laws. Although he spent only ten weeks in Jamaica, Lord Windsor laid the foundations of a governing system that was to last for two centuries: a crown-appointed governor acting with the advice of a nominated council in the legislature. The legislature consisted of the governor and an elected but highly unrepresentative [[House of Assembly of Jamaica|House of Assembly]].  For years, the planter-dominated Assembly was in continual conflict with the various governors and the Stuart kings; there were also contentious factions within the assembly itself. For much of the 1670s and 1680s, Charles II and [[James II of England|James II]] and the assembly feuded over such matters as the purchase of slaves from ships not run by the royal English trading company. The last Stuart governor, [[Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle]], who was more interested in [[treasure hunting]] than in planting, turned the planter oligarchy out of office. After the duke's death in 1688, the planters, who had fled Jamaica to London, succeeded in lobbying James II to order a return to the pre-Albemarle political arrangement (the local control of Jamaican planters belonging to the assembly).\n\n====Jamaica's pirates====\n{{Main|Port Royal}}\n{{Main|1692 Jamaica earthquake}}\n[[File:Henry Morgan in colour.jpg|thumb|upright|Henry Morgan, governor of Jamaica]]\nFollowing the 1655 conquest, Spain repeatedly attempted to recapture Jamaica.  In response, in 1657, Governor [[Edward D'Oyley]] invited the [[Brethren of the Coast]] to come to Port Royal and make it their home port. The Brethren was made up of a group of pirates who were descendants of cattle-hunting ''boucaniers'' (later Anglicised to buccaneers), who had turned to piracy after being robbed by the Spanish (and subsequently thrown out of Hispaniola).<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">Donny L. Hamilton, \"Pirates and Merchants: Port Royal, Jamaica,\" in ''X Marks the Spot: The Archaeology of Piracy,'' ed. Russell K. Skowronek and Charles R. Ewen, 13\u201330 (Gainesville, Florida: University Press of Florida, 2006).</ref> These pirates concentrated their attacks on Spanish shipping, whose interests were considered the major threat to the town. These pirates later became legal English [[privateers]] who were given [[letters of marque]] by Jamaica\u2019s governor. Around the same time that pirates were invited to Port Royal, England launched a series of attacks against Spanish shipping vessels and coastal towns. By sending the newly appointed privateers after Spanish ships and settlements, England had successfully set up a system of defense for Port Royal.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  Jamaica became a haven of privateers, buccaneers, and occasionally outright pirates: [[Christopher Myngs]], [[Edward Mansvelt]], and most famously, [[Henry Morgan]].\n\nEngland gained formal possession of Jamaica from [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in 1670 through the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)|Treaty of Madrid]]. Removing the pressing need for constant defense against Spanish attack, this change served as an incentive to [[Plantation economy|planting]]. This settlement also improved the supply of slaves and resulted in more protection, including military support, for the planters against foreign competition. As a result, the sugar monoculture and slave-worked plantation society spread across Jamaica throughout the 18th century, decreasing Jamaica's dependence on privateers for protection and funds.\n\nHowever, the English colonial authorities continued to have difficulties suppressing the Spanish Maroons, who made their homes in mountainous interior, and mounted periodic raids on estates and towns, such as [[Spanish Town]]. The Karmahaly Maroons continued to stay in the forested mountains, and periodically fought the English.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal'' (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 14-25.</ref>\n\nAnother blow to Jamaica's partnership with privateers was the violent [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|earthquake]] which destroyed much of Port Royal on 7 June 1692.  Two-thirds of the town sank into the sea immediately after the main shock.<ref name=\"USGS\">{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/events/1692_06_07.php|title=Historic Earthquakes: Jamaica 1692 June 07 UTC|last=USGS|date=October 21, 2009|accessdate=6 December 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66vVsy7KW?url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/events/1692_06_07.php|archivedate=14 April 2012}}</ref>  After the earthquake, the town was partially rebuilt but the colonial government was relocated to Spanish Town, which had been the capital under [[Spain|Spanish rule]].

Upon landing in Jamaica and other islands, they quickly urged local growers to change their main crops from [[cotton]] and [[tobacco]] to sugarcane. With depressed prices of cotton and tobacco, due mainly to stiff competition from the North American colonies, the farmers switched, leading to a boom in the Caribbean economies. sugarcane was quickly snapped up by the [[Great Britain|British]], who used it in [[cake]]s and to sweeten [[tea]]s.  In the 18th century, sugar replaced [[Piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]] as Jamaica's main source of income. The sugar industry was labour-intensive and the English brought hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans to Jamaica.  By 1832, the median-size plantation in Jamaica had about 150 slaves, and nearly one of every four bondsmen lived on units that had at least 250 slaves.<ref>Robert William Fogel, \"Slavery in the New World\". ''Without Consent or Contract: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery'', pp. 21\u201323.</ref>  After slavery was abolished in 1834, sugarcane [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s used a variety of forms of labour including workers imported from [[India]] under contracts of [[indenture]].\n\n====First Maroon War====\n{{Main|Jamaican_Maroons#History}}\n{{Main|First Maroon War}}\n\nWhen the British captured [[Jamaica]] in 1655, the Spanish colonists fled, leaving a large number of African slaves. These former Spanish slaves created three ''Palenques'', or settlements. Former slaves organised under the leadership of [[Juan de Serras]] allied with the Spanish guerrillas on the western end of the Cockpit Country, while those under [[Juan de Bolas]] established themselves in modern-day [[Clarendon Parish, Jamaica]] and served as a \"black militia\" for the English. The third chose to join those who had previously escaped from the Spanish to live and intermarry with the [[Arawak]] people. Each group of Maroons established distinct independent communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica. They survived by subsistence farming and periodic raids of plantations. Over time, the Maroons came to control large areas of the Jamaican interior.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sainsbury|first1=W. Noel|title=America and West Indies|journal=Calendar of State Papers Colonial, America and West Indies|volume=1, 5|issue=1574\u20131660, 1661\u20131668}}</ref>  Early in the 18th century, the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] took a heavy toll on the [[British Army|British troops]] and local militia sent against them in the interior, in what came to be known as the [[First Maroon War]].\n\nThe [[First Maroon War]] came to an end with a 1739\u201340 agreement between the Maroons and the British government. The Maroons were to remain in their five main towns ([[Accompong]]; [[Trelawny Town]]; [[Nanny Town]], later known as [[Moore Town]]; [[Scott's Hall]]; and Charles Town), living under their own rulers and a British supervisor. In exchange, they were asked to agree not to harbour new runaway slaves, but rather to help catch them. This last clause in the treaty naturally caused a split between the Maroons and the rest of the black population, although from time to time runaways from the plantations still found their way into Maroon settlements. Another provision of the agreement was that the Maroons would serve to protect the island from invaders. The latter was because the Maroons were revered by the British as skilled warriors.  The person responsible for the compromise with the British was the Leeward Maroon leader, [[Cudjoe]], a short, almost dwarf-like man who for years fought skillfully and bravely to maintain his people's independence. As he grew older, however, Cudjoe became increasingly disillusioned. He ran into quarrels with his lieutenants and with other Maroon groups. He felt that the only hope for the future was honorable peace with the enemy, which was just what the British were thinking. The 1739 treaty should be seen in this light. A year later, the even more rebellious Windward Maroons of Trelawny Town also agreed to sign a treaty under pressure from both white Jamaicans and the Leeward Maroons.\n\n====Tacky's revolt====\n{{Main|Tacky's revolt}}\n\nIn May 1760, Tacky, a slave overseer on the Frontier plantation in [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|Saint Mary Parish]], led a group of enslaved Africans in taking over the Frontier and Trinity plantations while killing their enslavers. They then marched to the storeroom at [[Fort Haldane]], where the munitions to defend the town of [[Port Maria]] were kept. After killing the storekeeper, Tacky and his men stole nearly 4 barrels of gunpowder and 40 firearms with [[lead shot|shot]], before marching on to overrun the plantations at Heywood Hall and Esher.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicans.com/culture/articles_culture/tackys_rebellion.shtml |title=Jamaican Culture |publisher=Jamaicans.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref> By dawn, hundreds of other slaves had joined Tacky and his followers. At Ballard's Valley, the rebels stopped to rejoice in their success. One slave from Esher decided to slip away and sound the alarm.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/> [[Obeah]]men (Caribbean witch doctors) quickly circulated around the camp dispensing a powder that they claimed would protect the men from injury in battle and loudly proclaimed that an Obeahman could not be killed. Confidence was high.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>  Soon there were 70 to 80 mounted militia on their way along with some Maroons from Scott's Hall, who were bound by treaty to suppress such rebellions. When the militia learned of the Obeahman's boast of not being able to be killed, an Obeahman was captured, killed and hung with his mask, ornaments of teeth and bone and feather trimmings at a prominent place visible from the encampment of rebels. Many of the rebels, confidence shaken, returned to their plantations. Tacky and 25 or so men decided to fight on.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>  Tacky and his men went running through the woods being chased by the Maroons and their legendary marksman, [[Davy the Maroon]]. While running at full speed, Davy shot Tacky and cut off his head as evidence of his feat, for which he would be richly rewarded. Tacky's head was later displayed on a pole in [[Spanish Town]] until a follower took it down in the middle of the night. The rest of Tacky's men were found in a cave near Tacky Falls, having committed suicide rather than going back to slavery.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>\n\n====Second Maroon War====\n{{Main|Second Maroon War}}\nIn 1795, the Second Maroon War was instigated when two [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] were flogged by a black slave for allegedly stealing two [[pigs]]. When six [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroon]] leaders came to the British to present their grievances, the British took them as prisoners.  This sparked an eight-month conflict, spurred by the fact that [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] felt that they were being mistreated under the terms of [[Cudjoe]]'s Treaty of 1739, which ended the [[First Maroon War]].  The war lasted for five months as a bloody stalemate. The British 5,000 troops and militia outnumbered the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] ten to one, but the mountainous and forested topography of Jamaica proved ideal for guerrilla warfare. The [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] surrendered in December 1795.  The treaty signed in December between Major General George Walpole and the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroon]] leaders established that the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] would beg on their knees for the King's forgiveness, return all runaway slaves, and be relocated elsewhere in Jamaica. The governor of Jamaica ratified the treaty, but gave the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] only three days to present themselves to beg forgiveness on 1 January 1796.  Suspicious of British intentions, most of the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] did not surrender until mid-March. The British used the contrived breach of treaty as a pretext to deport the entire Trelawny town [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] to [[Nova Scotia]]. After a few years the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] were again deported to the new British settlement of [[Sierra Leone]] in [[West Africa]].\n\n=== 19th century ===\n====The Baptist War====\n{{Main|Baptist War}}\nIn 1831, enslaved [[Baptist]] preacher [[Samuel Sharpe]] led a strike among demanding more freedom and a working wage of \"half the going wage rate.\" Upon refusal of their demands, the strike escalated into a full rebellion.

Approximately five hundred slaves were killed in total: 207 during the revolt and somewhere in the range between 310 and 340 slaves were killed through \"various forms of judicial executions\" after the rebellion was concluded, at times, for quite minor offences (one recorded execution indicates the crime being the theft of a pig; another, a cow).<ref>Mary Reckord. \"The Jamaican Slave Rebellion of 1831\", ''Past & Present'' (July 1968), 40(3): pp. 122, 124\u2013125.</ref> An 1853 account by Henry Bleby described how three or four simultaneous executions were commonly observed; bodies would be allowed to pile up until workhouse slaves carted the bodies away at night and bury them in mass graves outside town.<ref name=Revauger/> The brutality of the plantocracy during the revolt is thought to have accelerated the process of emancipation, with initial measures beginning in 1833.\n\n====Emancipation====\nBecause of the loss of property and life in the 1831 Baptist War rebellion, the British Parliament held two inquiries.  Their reports on conditions contributed greatly to the abolition movement and passage of the 1833 law to abolish slavery as of August 1, 1834, throughout the [[British Empire]]. The Jamaican slaves were bound (indentured) to their former owners' service, albeit with a guarantee of rights, until 1838 under what was called the [[Apprenticeship]] System.\n\nWith the [[Abolitionism|abolition of the slave trade]] in 1808 and [[slavery]] itself in 1834, however, the island's sugar- and slave-based economy faltered. The period after [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation]] in 1834 initially was marked by a conflict between the plantocracy and elements in the [[Colonial Office]] over the extent to which individual freedom should be coupled with political participation for blacks. In 1840 the assembly changed the voting qualifications in a way that enabled a majority of blacks and [[Mixed race people|people of mixed race]] (browns or [[mulatto]]s) to vote. But neither change in the political system, nor abolition of slavery changed the planter's chief interest, which lay in the continued profitability of their estates, and they continued to dominate the [[Elitism|elitist]] assembly. Nevertheless, at the end of the 19th century and in the early years of the 20th century, the crown began to allow some Jamaicans \u2013 mostly local merchants, urban professionals, and artisans\u2014into the appointed councils.\n\n====The Morant Bay Rebellion====\n{{Main|Morant Bay Rebellion}}\nTensions resulted in the October 1865 [[Morant Bay rebellion]] led by [[Paul Bogle]]. The rebellion was sparked on 7 October, when a black man was put on trial and imprisoned for allegedly trespassing on a long-abandoned plantation. During the proceedings, James Geoghegon, a black spectator, disrupted the trial, and in the police's attempts to seize him and remove him from the courthouse, a fight broke out between the police and other spectators. While pursuing Geoghegon, the two policeman were beaten with sticks and stones.<ref>Holt (1992), p. 295.</ref> The following Monday arrest warrants were issued for several men for rioting, resisting arrest, and assaulting the police. Among them was Baptist preacher Paul Bogle. A few days later on 11 October, Mr. Paul Bogle marched with a group of protesters to Morant Bay. When the group arrived at the court house they were met by a small and inexperienced volunteer militia. The crowd began pelting the militia with rocks and sticks, and the militia opened fire on the group, killing seven black protesters before retreating.\n\nGovernor [[Edward John Eyre|John Eyre]] sent government troops, under Brigadier-General [[Alexander Nelson (British Army officer)|Alexander Nelson]],<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19875 \"Alexander Nelson\"] at ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref> to hunt down the poorly armed rebels and bring Paul Bogle back to Morant Bay for trial. The troops met with no organised resistance, but regardless they killed blacks indiscriminately, most of whom had not been involved in the riot or rebellion: according to one soldier, \"we slaughtered all before us\u2026 man or woman or child\". In the end, 439 black Jamaicans were killed directly by soldiers, and 354 more (including Paul Bogle) were arrested and later executed, some without proper trials. Paul Bogle was executed \"either the same evening he was tried or the next morning.\"<ref name=\"IPN\">\"The Jamaica Prosecutions. Further Examinations of Colonel Nelson and Lieutenant Brand\", ''The Illustrated Police News: Law-Courts and Weekly Record'' (London), 23 February 1867: 1.</ref> Other punishments included flogging for over 600 men and women (including some pregnant women), and long prison sentences, with thousands of homes belonging to black Jamaicans were burned down without any justifiable reason.\n\n[[George William Gordon]], a Jamaican businessman and politician, who had been critical of Governor John Eyre and his policies, was later arrested by Governor John Eyre who believed he had been behind the rebellion. Despite having very little to do with it, Gordon was eventually executed. Though he was arrested in Kingston, he was transferred by Eyre to Morant Bay, where he could be tried under [[martial law]]. The execution and trial of Gordon via [[martial law]] raised some constitutional issues back in Britain, where concerns emerged about whether British dependencies should be ruled under the government of law, or through military license.<ref>{{cite book|last=Semmel|first=Bernard|title=The Governor Eyre Controversy|year=1962|publisher=MacGibbon & Kee|location=London|pages=128}}</ref>  The speedy trial saw Gordon hanged on 23 October, just two days after his trial had begun. He and William Bogle, Paul's brother, \"were both tried together, and executed at the same time.\n\n====Decline of the sugar industry====\n[[File:Cane cutters in Jamaica.jpg|thumb|upright|Sugar cane cutters in Jamaica, 1880]]\nDuring most of the 18th century, a [[Monocropping|monocrop]] economy based on sugarcane production for export flourished. In the last quarter of the century, however, the Jamaican sugar economy declined as famines, hurricanes, colonial wars, and wars of independence disrupted trade. By the 1820s, Jamaican sugar had become less competitive with that from high-volume producers such as Cuba and production subsequently declined. By 1882 sugar output was less than half the level achieved in 1828. A major reason for the decline was the [[British Parliament]]'s [[Slave Trade Act 1807|1807 abolition of the slave trade]], under which the transportation of slaves to Jamaica after 1 March 1808 was forbidden; the abolition of the slave trade was followed by [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|the abolition of slavery in 1834]] and full emancipation within four years. Unable to convert the ex-slaves into a sharecropping tenant class similar to the one established in the [[Reconstruction Era|post-Civil War South of the United States]], planters became increasingly dependent on wage labour and began recruiting workers abroad, primarily from [[British Raj|India]], [[Qing Dynasty|China]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Many of the former slaves settled in peasant or small farm communities in the interior of the island, the \"yam belt,\" where they engaged in subsistence and some [[cash crop]] farming.\n\nThe second half of the 19th century was a period of severe economic decline for Jamaica. Low crop prices, droughts, and disease led to serious social unrest, culminating in the [[Morant Bay rebellion]]s of 1865. However, renewed British administration after the 1865 rebellion, in the form of [[crown colony]] status, resulted in some social and economic progress as well as investment in the physical infrastructure. Agricultural development was the centrepiece of restored British rule in Jamaica. In 1868 the first large-scale irrigation project was launched. In 1895 the Jamaica Agricultural Society was founded to promote more scientific and profitable methods of farming. Also in the 1890s, the Crown Lands Settlement Scheme was introduced, a land reform program of sorts, which allowed small farmers to purchase two hectares or more of land on favourable terms.\n\n[[File:Valentine_and_Sons_-_Cane_Cutters,_Jamaica,_1891.jpg|thumb|left|Sugar cane cutters in Jamaica, 1891]]\nBetween 1865 and 1930, the character of landholding in Jamaica changed substantially, as sugar declined in importance. As many former plantations went bankrupt, some land was sold to Jamaican peasants under the Crown Lands Settlement whereas other cane fields were consolidated by dominant British producers, most notably by the British firm [[Tate & Lyle|Tate and Lyle]]. Although the concentration of land and wealth in Jamaica was not as drastic as in the [[Spanish Caribbean|Spanish-speaking Caribbean]], by the 1920s the typical sugar plantation on the island had increased to an average of 266 hectares. But, as noted, smallscale agriculture in Jamaica survived the consolidation of land by sugar powers. The number of small holdings in fact tripled between 1865 and 1930, thus retaining a large portion of the population as peasantry. Most of the expansion in small holdings took place before 1910, with farms averaging between two and twenty hectares.\n\nThe rise of the [[banana]] trade during the second half of the 19th century also changed production and trade patterns on the island. Bananas were first exported in 1867, and banana farming grew rapidly thereafter. By 1890, bananas had replaced sugar as Jamaica's principal export. Production rose from 5 million stems (32 percent of exports) in 1897 to an average of 20 million stems a year in the 1920s and 1930s, or over half of domestic exports. As with sugar, the presence of American companies, like the well-known [[United Fruit Company]] in Jamaica, was a driving force behind renewed agricultural exports. The British also became more interested in Jamaican bananas than in the country's sugar. Expansion of banana production, however, was hampered by serious labour shortages. The rise of the banana economy took place amidst a general exodus of up to 11,000 Jamaicans a year.\n\n====Jamaica as a Crown Colony====\nIn 1846 Jamaican planters, adversely affected by the loss of slave labour, suffered a crushing blow when Britain passed the [[Sugar Duties Act 1846|Sugar Duties Act]], eliminating Jamaica's traditionally favoured status as its primary supplier of sugar. The Jamaica House of Assembly stumbled from one crisis to another until the collapse of the [[sugar trade]], when racial and religious tensions came to a head during the [[Morant Bay rebellion]] of 1865. Although suppressed ruthlessly, the severe rioting so alarmed the planters that the two-centuries-old assembly voted to abolish itself and asked for the establishment of direct British rule.  In 1866 the new [[crown colony]] government consisted of the Legislative Council and the executive Privy Council containing members of both chambers of the House of Assembly, but the Colonial Office exercised effective power through a presiding British governor. The council included a few handpicked prominent Jamaicans for the sake of appearance only. In the late 19th century, crown colony rule was modified; representation and limited self-rule were reintroduced gradually into Jamaica after 1884. The colony's legal structure was reformed along the lines of [[English common law]] and county courts, and a [[Jamaica Constabulary Force|constabulary force]] was established.  The smooth working of the crown colony system was dependent on a good understanding and an identity of interests between the governing officials, who were [[British people|British]], and most of the nonofficial, nominated members of the Legislative Council, who were [[Jamaican people|Jamaicans]]. The elected members of this body were in a permanent minority and without any influence or administrative power. The unstated alliance \u2013 based on shared color, attitudes, and interest \u2013 between the British officials and the Jamaican upper class was reinforced in London, where the West India Committee lobbied for Jamaican interests. Jamaica's white or near-white propertied class continued to hold the dominant position in every respect; the vast majority of the black population remained poor and unenfranchised.\n\n====Religion====\nUntil it was disestablished in 1870, the Church of England in Jamaica was the established church. It represented the white English community. It received funding from the colonial government, and was given responsibility for providing religious instruction to the slaves. It was challenged by Methodist missionaries from England, and the Methodists in turn were denounced as troublemakers. The Church of England in Jamaica established the Jamaica Home and Foreign Missionary Society in 1861; its mission stations multiplied, with financial help from religious organizations in London. The Society sent its own missionaries to West Africa. Baptist missions grew rapidly, thanks to missionaries from England and the United States, and became the largest denomination by 1900. Baptist missionaries denounced the apprentice system as a form of slavery. In the 1870s and 1880s the Methodists opened a high school and a theological college. Other Protestant groups included the Moravians, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Seventh-day Adventist, Church of God, and others.  There were several thousand Roman Catholics.<ref>See [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08270a.htm \"Jamaica' in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1910)]</ref>  The population was largely Christian by 1900, and most families were linked with the church or a Sunday School. Traditional pagan practices persisted in unorganized fashion, such as witchcraft.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette. ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, III: The Nineteenth Century Outside Europe: The Americas, the Pacific, Asia and Africa'' (1961), pp. 279\u201381.</ref>\n\n====Kingston, the new capital====\n{{Main|Kingston, Jamaica#History}}\nIn 1872, the government passed an act to transfer government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston.  Kingston had been founded as a refuge for survivors of the [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|1692 earthquake]] that destroyed [[Port Royal]].  The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by fire in 1703.  Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the center of trade for [[Jamaica]]. The government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in [[Port Royal]], and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of [[Liguanea]]. In 1755 the [[List of Governors of Jamaica|governor]], [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]], had decided to transfer the government offices from [[Spanish Town]] to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston.  The [[1907 Kingston earthquake]] destroyed much of the city.  Considered by many writers of that time one of the world's deadliest earthquakes, it resulted in the death of over eight hundred Jamaicans and destroyed the homes of over ten thousand more.<ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite book|author=J.

He was proclaimed Jamaica's first national hero in the 1960s after [[Edward Seaga|Edward P.G. Seaga]], then a government minister, arranged the return of his remains to Jamaica. In 1987 Jamaica petitioned the [[United States Congress]] to pardon Garvey on the basis that the federal charges brought against him were unsubstantiated and unjust.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marcus Garvey 1887\u20131940|url=http://www.theunia-acl.com/index.php/marcus-garvey-1887-1940|publisher=UNIA-ACL|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Rastafari movement====\n{{Main|Rastafari movement}}\nThe [[Rastafari movement]], a new religion, emerged among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Anglocentrism|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by black nationalist figures like [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several Christian clergymen, most notably Leonard Howell, proclaimed that the crowning of [[Haile Selassie]] as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's counter-cultural stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians like [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley.<ref>M.G.

Economic stagnation, discontent with unemployment, low wages, high prices, and poor living conditions caused [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|social unrest in the 1930s]]. Uprisings in Jamaica began on the Frome Sugar Estate in the western [[Westmoreland Parish|parish of Westmoreland]] and quickly spread east to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Jamaica, in particular, set the pace for the region in its demands for economic development from British colonial rule.\n\nBecause of disturbances in Jamaica and the rest of the region, the British in 1938 appointed the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Moyne Commission]]. An immediate result of the Commission was the Colonial Development Welfare Act, which provided for the expenditure of approximately \u01411 million a year for twenty years on coordinated development in the [[British West Indies]]. Concrete actions, however, were not implemented to deal with Jamaica's massive structural problems.\n\n====New unions and parties====\nThe rise of [[nationalism]], as distinct from island identification or desire for [[self-determination]], is generally dated to the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|1938 labour riots]] that affected both Jamaica and the islands of the Eastern Caribbean. [[William Alexander Bustamante]], a moneylender in the capital city of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] who had formed the Jamaica Trade Workers and Tradesmen Union (JTWTU) three years earlier, captured the imagination of the black masses with his messianic personality, even though he himself was light-skinned, affluent, and aristocratic. Bustamante emerged from the 1938 strikes and other disturbances as a populist leader and the principal spokesperson for the militant urban working class, and in that year, using the JTWTU as a stepping stone, he founded the [[Bustamante Industrial Trade Union]] (BITU), which inaugurated Jamaica's workers movement.\n\nA distant cousin of Bustamante's, [[Norman Manley|Norman W. Manley]], concluded as a result of the 1938 riots that the real basis for national unity in Jamaica lay in the masses. Unlike the union-oriented Bustamante, however, Manley was more interested in access to control over [[Power (social and political)|state power]] and [[political rights]] for the masses. On 18 September 1938, he inaugurated the [[People's National Party]] (PNP), which had begun as a nationalist movement supported by the mixed-race middle class and the liberal sector of the business community with leaders who were highly educated members of the [[upper middle class]]. The 1938 riots spurred the PNP to [[Trade union|unionise labour]], although it would be several years before the PNP formed major labour unions. The party concentrated its earliest efforts on establishing a network both in urban areas and in banana-growing rural [[Parishes of Jamaica|parishes]], later working on building support among small farmers and in areas of bauxite mining.\n\nThe PNP adopted a [[socialist]] ideology in 1940 and later joined the [[Socialist International]], allying itself formally with the [[social democratic]] parties of [[Western Europe]]. Guided by socialist principles, Manley was not a doctrinaire socialist. PNP socialism during the 1940s was similar to [[British Labour Party]] ideas on state control of the factors of production, [[equality of opportunity]], and a [[welfare state]], although a left-wing element in the PNP held more orthodox [[Marxist]] views and worked for the internationalisation of the trade union movement through the Caribbean Labour Congress. In those formative years of Jamaican political and union activity, relations between Manley and Bustamante were cordial. Manley defended Bustamante in court against charges brought by the British for his labour activism in the 1938 riots and looked after the BITU during Bustamante's imprisonment.\n\nBustamante had political ambitions of his own, however. In 1942, while still incarcerated, he founded a political party to rival the PNP, called the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP). The new party, whose leaders were of a lower class than those of the PNP, was supported by conservative businessmen and 60,000 dues-paying BITU members, who encompassed dock and sugar plantation workers and other unskilled urban labourers. On his release in 1943, Bustamante began building up the JLP. Meanwhile, several PNP leaders organised the leftist-oriented Trade Union Congress (TUC). Thus, from an early stage in modern Jamaica, unionised labour was an integral part of organised political life.\n\nFor the next quarter century, Bustamante and Manley competed for centre stage in Jamaican political affairs, the former espousing the cause of the \"barefoot man\"; the latter, \"democratic socialism,\" a loosely defined political and economic theory aimed at achieving a [[Classless society|classless]] system of government. Jamaica's two founding fathers projected quite different popular images. Bustamante, lacking even a [[high school diploma]], was an autocratic, charismatic, and highly adept politician; Manley was an athletic, [[University of Oxford|Oxford-trained]] lawyer, [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholar]], humanist, and liberal intellectual. Although considerably more reserved than Bustamante, Manley was well liked and widely respected. He was also a visionary nationalist who became the driving force behind the crown colony's quest for independence.\n\nFollowing the 1938 disturbances in the [[West Indies]], [[London]] sent the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Moyne Commission]] to study conditions in the [[British West Indies|British Caribbean territories]]. Its findings led in the early 1940s to better wages and a new constitution. Issued on 20 November 1944, the [[Constitution of Jamaica|Constitution]] modified the crown colony system and inaugurated limited self-government based on the [[Westminster system|Westminster model of government]] and [[universal adult suffrage]]. It also embodied the island's principles of ministerial responsibility and the rule of law. Thirty-one percent of the population participated in the [[Jamaican general election, 1944|1944 elections]]. The JPL \u2013 helped by its promises to create jobs, its practice of dispensing public funds in pro-JLP parishes, and the PNP's relatively radical platform \u2013 won an 18 percent majority of the votes over the PNP, as well as 22 seats in the 32-member House of Representatives, with 5 going to the PNP and 5 to other short-lived parties. In 1945 Bustamante took office as Jamaica's first premier (the pre-independence title for [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|head of government]]).\n\nUnder the new charter, the British governor, assisted by the six-member Privy Council and ten-member Executive Council, remained responsible solely to the crown. The Jamaican Legislative Council became the upper house, or Senate, of the bicameral Parliament. House members were elected by adult suffrage from single-member electoral districts called constituencies. Despite these changes, ultimate power remained concentrated in the hands of the governor and other high officials.<ref name=jlp>{{cite web|title=The Jamaican Labour Party (JLP) |url=http://www.alexanderbustamante.com/the-jlp.php |work=2005 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803163859/http://www.alexanderbustamante.com/the-jlp.php |archivedate=3 August 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref name=Constit>{{cite web|title=History this week:Constitutional Developments in British Guiana and Jamaica between 1890 and 1945 (Part 3)|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2010/features/05/13/history-this-weekconstitutional-developments-in-british-guiana-and-jamaica-between-1890-and-1945-part-3/|work=13 May 2010|publisher=StabroekNews|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Independent Jamaica (1962-)}}Independent Jamaica (1962\u2013present)==\n===1960s===\n\n====The road to independence====\n{{Main|Independence of Jamaica}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Jamaica began a relatively [[Independence of Jamaica|long transition to full political independence]]. Jamaicans preferred [[British culture]] over [[American culture|American]], but they had a [[love-hate relationship]] with the British and resented British domination, [[racism]], and the dictatorial Colonial Office. Britain gradually granted the colony more self-government under periodic constitutional changes. Jamaica's political patterns and governmental structure were shaped during two decades of what was called \"constitutional [[decolonisation]],\" the period between 1944 and independence in 1962.\n\nHaving seen how little popular appeal the PNP's 1944 campaign position had, the party shifted toward the centre in 1949 and remained there until 1974. The PNP actually won a 0.8-percent majority of the votes over the JLP in the [[Jamaican general election, 1949|1949 election]], although the JLP won a majority of the House seats. In the 1950s, the PNP and JLP became increasingly similar in their sociological composition and ideological outlook. During the [[cold war]] years, socialism became an explosive domestic issue. The JLP exploited it among property owners and churchgoers, attracting more middle-class support. As a result, PNP leaders diluted their socialist rhetoric, and in 1952 the PNP moderated its image by expelling four prominent leftists who had controlled the TUC. The PNP then formed the more conservative [[National Workers Union (Jamaica)|National Workers Union]] (NWU). Henceforth, PNP socialism meant little more than national planning within a framework of private property and foreign capital. The PNP retained, however, a basic commitment to socialist precepts, such as public control of resources and a more equitable income distribution. Manley's PNP came to office for the first time after winning the [[Jamaican general election, 1955|1955 elections]] with an 11-percent majority over the JLP and 50.5 percent of the popular vote.\n\nAmendments to the constitution that took effect in May 1953 reconstituted the Executive Council and provided for eight ministers to be selected from among House members. The first ministries were subsequently established. These amendments also enlarged the limited powers of the House of Representatives and made elected members of the governor's executive council responsible to the legislature. Manley, elected [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|chief minister]] beginning in January 1955, accelerated the process of decolonisation during his able stewardship. Further progress toward [[self-government]] was achieved under constitutional amendments in 1955 and 1956, and cabinet government was established on 11 November 1957.\n\nAssured by British declarations that independence would be granted to a collective West Indian state rather than to individual colonies, Manley supported Jamaica's joining nine other British territories in the [[West Indies Federation]], established on 3 January 1958. Manley became the island's premier after the PNP again won a decisive victory in the [[Jamaican general election, 1959|general election in July 1959]], securing thirty of forty-five House seats.\n\nMembership in the federation remained an issue in Jamaican politics. Bustamante, reversing his previously supportive position on the issue, warned of the financial implications of membership \u2013 Jamaica was responsible for 43 percent of its own financing \u2013 and an inequity in Jamaica's proportional representation in the federation's House of Assembly. Manley's PNP favoured staying in the federation, but he agreed to hold a [[Jamaican Federation of the West Indies membership referendum, 1961|referendum in September 1961]] to decide on the issue. When 54 percent of the electorate voted to withdraw, Jamaica left the federation, which dissolved in 1962 after [[Trinidad and Tobago]] also pulled out. Manley believed that the rejection of his pro-federation policy in the 1961 referendum called for a renewed mandate from the electorate, but the JLP won the [[Jamaican general election, 1962|election of early 1962]] by a fraction. Bustamante assumed the premiership that April, and Manley spent his remaining few years in politics as leader of the opposition.\n\nJamaica received [[Independence of Jamaica|its independence]] on 6 August 1962. The new nation retained, however, its membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and adopted a [[Westminster parliamentary system|Westminster-style parliamentary system]]. Bustamante, at the age of 78, became the new nation's first prime minister.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jamaica: Self-government|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/299716/Jamaica/214972/Self-government#ref515864|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The West Indies Federation |url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/west_indies_federation.jsp?menu=community |work=2011 |publisher=CARICOM |accessdate=24 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929234257/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/west_indies_federation.jsp?menu=community |archivedate=29 September 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====Jamaica under Bustamante====\nBustamante subsequently became the first [[Prime Minister of Jamaica]].

This pattern was accelerated with the export of bauxite beginning in the 1950s. The economic structure shifted from a dependence on agriculture that in 1950 accounted for 30.8 percent of GDP to an agricultural contribution of 12.9 percent in 1960 and 6.7 percent in 1970. During the same period, the contribution to GDP of mining increased from less than 1 percent in 1950 to 9.3 percent in 1960 and 12.6 percent in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leaders since 1962 |url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/This%20Is%20Jamaica/leaders.html |publisher=This is Jamaica |accessdate=24 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904154730/http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/This%20Is%20Jamaica/leaders.html |archivedate=4 September 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====Reggae====\n{{Main|Reggae#History}}\nJamaica's [[reggae]] music developed from [[Ska]] and [[rocksteady]] in the 1960s.

[[The Pioneers (band)|The Pioneers]]' 1968 track \"Long Shot (Bus' Me Bet)\" has been identified as the earliest recorded example of the new rhythm sound that became known as reggae.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upsetter.net/scratch/biography01.htm |title=Shocks Of Mighty: An Upsetting Biography |publisher=Upsetter.net|accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nEarly 1968 was when the first ''bona fide'' reggae records were released: \"Nanny Goat\" by [[Larry Marshall (singer)|Larry Marshall]] and \"No More Heartaches\" by The Beltones.

American artist [[Johnny Nash]]'s 1968 hit \"Hold Me Tight\" has been credited with first putting reggae in the American listener charts.

Under Manley, Jamaica established a minimum wage for all workers, including domestic workers. In 1974, Manley proposed free education from primary school to university. The introduction of universally free secondary education was a major step in removing the institutional barriers to private sector and preferred government jobs that required secondary diplomas. The PNP government in 1974 also formed the Jamaica Movement for the Advancement of Literacy (JAMAL), which administered adult education programs with the goal of involving 100,000 adults a year.\n\nLand reform expanded under his administration. Historically, land tenure in Jamaica has been rather inequitable. Project Land Lease (introduced in 1973), attempted an integrated rural development approach, providing tens of thousands of small farmers with land, technical advice, inputs such as fertilisers and access to credit. An estimated 14 percent of idle land was redistributed through this program, much of which had been abandoned during the post-war urban migration and/or purchased by large bauxite companies.\n\nThe minimum voting age was lowered to 18 years, while equal pay for women was introduced.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Insight Guide: Jamaica, Insight Guides, APA Publications, 2009.</ref> Maternity leave was also introduced, while the government outlawed the stigma of illegitimacy. The [[Master and Servant Act|Masters and Servants Act]] was abolished, and a Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act provided workers and their trade unions with enhanced rights. The National Housing Trust was established, providing \"the means for most employed people to own their own homes,\" and greatly stimulated housing construction, with more than 40,000 houses built between 1974 and 1980.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSubsidised meals, transportation and uniforms for schoolchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds were introduced,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> together with free education at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">The Greenwood encyclopaedia of LGBT issues worldwide, Volume 1 by Chuck Stewart</ref> Special employment programmes were also launched,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Kari Levitt, ''Reclaiming development: independent thought and Caribbean community''.</ref> together with programmes designed to combat illiteracy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Increases in pensions and poor relief were carried out,<ref name=Kaufman>Michael Kaufman, ''Jamaica under Manley: dilemmas of socialism and democracy''.</ref> along with a reform of local government taxation, an increase in youth training,<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> an expansion of day care centres.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> and an upgrading of hospitals.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">Euclid A.

The concert came to its peak during [[Bob Marley|Bob Marley & The Wailers]]' performance of \"Jammin'\", when [[Bob Marley|Marley]] joined the hands of political rivals [[Michael Manley]] ([[People's National Party|PNP]]) and [[Edward Seaga]] ([[Jamaican Labour Party|JLP]]).\n\n====Edward Seaga====\nIn the 1980 election, [[Edward Seaga]] and the JLP won by an overwhelming majority \u2013 57 percent of the popular vote and 51 of the 60 seats in the [[Parliament of Jamaica|House of Representatives]].  Seaga immediately began to reverse the policies of his predecessor by privatising industry and seeking closer ties with the USA.  Seaga was one of the first foreign heads of government to visit newly elected US president [[Ronald Reagan]] early the next year and was one of the architects of the [[Caribbean Basin Initiative]], which was sponsored by Reagan. He delayed his promise to cut diplomatic relations with [[Cuba]] until a year later when he accused the Cuban government of giving [[Right of asylum|asylum]] to Jamaican criminals.\n\nSeaga supported the collapse of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] regime in [[Grenada]] and the subsequent US-led invasion of that island in October 1983. On the back of the Grenada invasion, Seaga called [[Jamaican general election, 1983|snap elections]] at the end of 1983, which Manley's PNP boycotted. His party thus controlled all seats in parliament. In an unusual move, because the Jamaican constitution required an opposition in the appointed [[Parliament of Jamaica|Senate]], Seaga appointed eight independent senators to form an official opposition.\n\nSeaga lost much of his US support when he was unable to deliver on his early promises of removing the bauxite levy, and his domestic support also plummeted. Articles attacking Seaga appeared in the US media and foreign investors left the country. Rioting in 1987 and 1988, the continued high popularity of Michael Manley, and complaints of governmental incompetence in the wake of the devastation of the island by [[Hurricane Gilbert]] in 1988, also contributed to his defeat in the [[Jamaican general election, 1989|1989 elections]].\n\n====Hurricane Gilbert====\n{{Main|Hurricane Gilbert}}\nIn 1988, [[Hurricane Gilbert]] produced a {{convert|19|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[storm surge]] and brought up to {{convert|823|mm|in}} of rain in the mountainous areas of Jamaica,<ref name=\"uwi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mona.uwi.edu/cardin/virtual_library/docs/1139/1139.pdf|title=Assessment of Rainfall Characteristics and Landslide Hazards in Jamaica|author=Ahmad, Rafi, Lawrence Brown, Jamaica National Meteorological Service|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin]]|page=27|date=10 January 2006|accessdate=6 June 2012}}</ref> causing inland flash flooding. 49 people died.<ref name=\"1988mwr\">{{cite journal|author=Lawrence, Miles B.|author2=Gross, James M.|year=1989|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1988.pdf|title=Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1988|accessdate=24 February 2007|issn=0027-0644|journal=Monthly Weather Review|page=2253|volume=117|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1989)117<2248:AHSO>2.0.CO;2|publisher=American Meteorological Service|issue=10|bibcode = 1989MWRv..117.2248L }}</ref> Prime Minister [[Edward Seaga]] stated that the hardest hit areas near where Gilbert made landfall looked \"like [[Hiroshima]] after the [[nuclear weapon|atom bomb]].\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Patrick Reyna|agency=Associated Press|date=14 September 1988|title=Jamaica's Premier Reports Island Devastated by Hurricane|location=Kingston, Jamaica}} (accessed through LexisNexis)</ref> The storm left US$4&nbsp;billion (in 1988 dollars) in damage from destroyed crops, buildings, houses, roads, and small aircraft.<ref name=\"The Storm and its Effects\">{{cite journal|title=The Storm And Its Effects |url=http://www.crid.or.cr/digitalizacion/pdf/eng/doc6803/doc6803-01.pdf |accessdate=4 March 2012 |format=PDF|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222221941/http://www.crid.or.cr/digitalizacion/pdf/eng/doc6803/doc6803-01.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2012 |df= }}</ref> Two people eventually had to be rescued because of [[mudslide]]s triggered by Gilbert and were sent to the hospital.

Prime Minister [[Edward Seaga]] announced the election date on January 15, 1989 at a rally in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]].<ref>Treaster, Joseph B., [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/17/world/jamaica-election-set-for-february.html \"Jamaica election set for February\"], ''The New York Times'', 17 January 1989.</ref>  He cited emergency conditions caused by [[Hurricane Gilbert]] in 1988 as the reason for extending the parliamentary term beyond its normal five-year mandate.<ref>Lansford, Tom (2014). \"Political Handbook of the World 2014\", p. 717. {{ISBN|1483333272}}, 9781483333274.</ref>\n\nThe date and tone of the election were shaped in part by [[Hurricane Gilbert]], which made landfall in September 1988 and decimated the island.  The hurricane caused almost $1 billion worth of damage to the island, with banana and coffee crops wiped out and thousands of homes destroyed.  Both parties engaged in campaigning through the distribution of relief supplies, a hallmark of the Jamaican patronage system.  Political commentators noted that prior to the hurricane, Edward Seaga and the JLP trailed Michael Manley and the PNP by twenty points in opinion polls.  The ability to provide relief as the party in charge allowed Seaga to improve his standing among voters and erode the inevitability of Manley's victory.  However, scandals related to the relief effort cost Seaga and the JLP some of the gains made immediately following the hurricane.  Scandals that emerged included National Security Minister [[Errol Anderson]] personally controlling a warehouse full of disaster relief supplies and candidate [[Joan Gordon-Webley]] distributing American-donated flour in sacks with her picture on them.<ref>Kurlansky, Mark, [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/27/magazine/showdown-in-jamaica.html?pagewanted=all \"Showdown in Jamaica\"], ''The New York Times'', 27 November 1988.</ref>\n\nThe election was characterised by a narrower ideological difference between the two parties on economic issues.  Michael Manley facilitated his comeback campaign by moderating his leftist positions and admitting mistakes made as Prime Minister, saying he erred when he involved government in economic production and had abandoned all thoughts of nationalising industry.  He cited the PNP's desire to continue the market-oriented policies of the JLP government, but with a more participatory approach.<ref>Garrity, Michele and Picard, Louis A. \"Policy Reform for Sustainable Development in the Caribbean\", p. 39. {{ISBN|4274900991}}, 9784274900990.</ref>  Prime Minister Edward Seaga ran on his record of economic growth and the reduction of unemployment in Jamaica, using the campaign slogan \"Don't Let Them Wreck It Again\" to refer to Manley's tenure as Prime Minister.<ref name=\"articles.sun-sentinel.com\">Melvin, Don, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-02-06/news/8901070618_1_michael-manley-minister-jamaica-labour-party \"Personalities Of Candidates Key Issue In Jamaica Election\"], ''Sun Sentinel'', 6 February 1989.</ref>  Seaga during his tenure as Prime Minister emphasised the need to tighten public sector spending and cut close to 27,000 public sector jobs in 1983 and 1984.<ref>Tanna, Laura, [http://mobile.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100314/arts/arts4.php \"On development and losing elections\"] (interview with former Prime Minister Edward Seaga), ''Jamaica Gleaner'', 14 March 2010.</ref> He shifted his plans as elections neared with a promise to spend J$1 billion on a five-year Social Well-Being Programme, which would build new hospitals and schools in Jamaica.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20040111/focus/focus5.html |title=Missed opportunities: From old partners to new partnerships |author=Buddan, Robert |work=Jamaica Gleaner|date=11 January 2004|accessdate=7 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222246/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20040111/focus/focus5.html |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df= }}</ref>  Foreign policy also played a role in the 1989 election.

Various measures were, however, undertaken to cushion the negative effects of liberalisation. A Social Support Programme was introduced to provide welfare assistance for poor Jamaicans. In addition, the programme focused on creating direct employment, training, and credit for much of the population.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>  The government also announced a 50% increase in the number of food stamps for the most vulnerable groups (including pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children) was announced. A small number of community councils were also created. In addition, a limited land reform programme was carried out that leased and sold land to small farmers, and land plots were granted to hundreds of farmers. The government also had an admirable record in housing provision, while measures were also taken to protect consumers from illegal and unfair business practices.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nIn 1992, citing health reasons, Manley stepped down as Prime Minister and PNP leader. His former Deputy Prime Minister, [[Percival Patterson]], assumed both offices.

Negotiations led in 1993 to the EU agreeing to maintain the Caribbean producers' preferential access until the end of Lom\u00e9 IV, pending possible negotiation on an extension.  In 1995, the United States government petitioned to the [[World Trade Organization]] to investigate whether the Lom\u00e9 IV convention had violated WTO rules. Then later in 1996, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, effectively ending the cross-subsidies that had benefited ACP countries for many years. But the US remained unsatisfied and insisted that all preferential trade agreements between the EU and ACP should cease. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body established another panel to discuss the issue and concluded that agreements between the EU and ACP were indeed not compatible with WTO regulations. Finally, the EU negotiated with the US through WTO to reach an agreement.[http://www.coha.org/2005/05/16/banana-wars-continue-%E2%80%93-chiquita-once-again-tries-to-work-its-omnipotent-will-now-under-new-management-likely-big-losers-will-be-caricom%E2%80%99s-windward-islands/]\n\nIn tourism, after a decrease in volume following the [[11 September attacks]] in the U.S., the number of tourists going to Jamaica eventually rebounded, with the island now receiving over a million tourists each year.

Other varieties of dancehall achieved crossover success outside of Jamaica during the mid-to-late 1990s.  In the 1990s, dancehall came under increasing criticism for anti-gay lyrics such as those found in Buju Banton's 1988 hit \"Boom Bye Bye,\" which is about shooting a gay man in the head: \"It's like boom bye bye / Inna batty boy head / Rude boy nah promote no nasty man / Dem haffi dead.\" <ref>{{cite news |last=West |first=Keon |date=6 June 2014 |title=Why do so many Jamaicans hate gay people? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/06/jamaica-music-anti-gay-dancehall-homophobia |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=4 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe early 2000s saw the success of newer charting acts such as [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]], [[Tanya Stephens]], and [[Sean Paul]].

Under Christopher Coke's leadership, the gang trafficked drugs and dabbled in visa fraud (using a high-school athletics team) and extortion, charging small traders in the nearby market for \u201cprotection money\u201d.  The gang had close political ties. Tivoli Gardens is part of the Kingston Western parliamentary district, a seat was held for years by [[Edward Seaga]], long-time leader of the [[Jamaica Labour Party|JLP]].

At its greatest extent, Jamaica is {{convert|146|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, and its width varies between {{convert|34|and|84|km|mi|abbr=on}}. With an area of {{convert|10,911|km2|abbr=on}}, Jamaica is the largest island of the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]] and the third largest of the [[Greater Antilles]], after [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]. Many small islands are located along the south coast of Jamaica, such as the [[Port Royal Cays]]. Southwest of mainland Jamaica lies [[Pedro Bank]], an area of shallow seas, with a number of [[cay]]s (low islands or reefs), extending generally east to west for over {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}}. To the southeast lies Morant Bank, with the [[Morant Cays]], {{convert|51|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Morant Point]], the easternmost point of mainland Jamaica. [[Alice Shoal]], {{convert|260|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the main island of Jamaica, falls within the Jamaica\u2013Colombia Joint Regime.\n\n==Geology and landforms==\n{{main|Geology of Jamaica}}\nJamaica and the other islands of the Antilles evolved from an arc of ancient volcanoes that rose from the sea millions of years ago. During periods of submersion, thick layers of limestone were laid down over the old igneous and metamorphic rock. In many places, the limestone is thousands of feet{{Specify|date=March 2012}} thick. The country can be divided into three landform regions: the central mountain chain formed by igneous and metamorphic rocks; the karst limestone hills in the Cockpit area; the low-lying coastal plains and interior valleys.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fiwiroots.com/terrain.html|title=Jamaica Terrain, Features, Size and Population - Fiwi Roots|website=fiwiroots.com|access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref>\n\nThe highest area is the [[Blue Mountains (Jamaica)|Blue Mountains]] range. These eastern mountains are formed by a central ridge of metamorphic rock running northwest to southeast from which many long spurs jut to the north and south. For a distance of over {{convert|3|km|mi}}, the crest of the ridge exceeds {{convert|1800|m|ft}}. The highest point is [[Blue Mountain Peak]] at {{convert|7402|ft|m|order=flip}}. The Blue Mountains rise to these elevations from the coastal plain in the space of about {{convert|16|km|mi}}, thus producing one of the steepest general gradients in the world. In this part of the country, the old metamorphic rock reveals itself through the surrounding limestone. To the north of the Blue Mountains lies the strongly tilted [[limestone]] plateau forming the [[John Crow Mountains]]. This range rises to elevations of over {{convert|1000|m|ft}}. To the west, in the central part of the country, are two high rolling plateaus: the [[Dry Harbour Mountains]] to the north and the Manchester Plateau to the south. Between the two, the land is rugged and here, also, the limestone layers are broken by the older rocks. Streams that rise in the region flow outward and sink soon after reaching the limestone layers.\n\nThe limestone plateau covers two-thirds of the country, so that [[karst]] formations dominate the island. Karst is formed by the erosion of the limestone in solution. Sinkholes, caves and caverns, disappearing streams, hummocky hills, and terra rosa (residual red) soils in the valleys are distinguishing features of a karst landscape; all these are present in Jamaica. To the west of the mountains is the rugged terrain of the [[Cockpit Country]], one of the world's most dramatic examples of karst topography.\n\nThe Cockpit Country is pockmarked with steep-sided hollows, as much as {{convert|120|m|ft}} deep in places, which are separated by conical hills and ridges. On the north, the main defining feature is the fault-based \"Escarpment\", a long ridge that extends from Flagstaff in the west, through Windsor in the centre, to Campbells and the start of the Barbecue Bottom Road (B10). The Barbecue Bottom Road, which runs north-south, high along the side of a deep, fault-based valley in the east, is the only drivable route across the [[Cockpit Country]]. However, there are two old, historical trails that cross further west, the Troy Trail, and the Quick Step Trail, both of which are seldom used {{As of|2006|lc=y}} and difficult to find. In the southwest, near Quick Step, is the district known as the \"Land of Look Behind,\" so named because Spanish horsemen venturing into this region of hostile runaway slaves were said to have ridden two to a mount, one rider facing to the rear to keep a precautionary watch. Where the ridges between sinkholes in the plateau area have dissolved, flat-bottomed basins or valleys have been formed that are filled with terra rosa soils, some of the most productive on the island. The largest basin is the Vale of Clarendon, {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. Queen of Spains Valley, [[Nassau Valley]], and Cave Valley were formed by the same process.\n\n==Coasts==\nThe coastline of Jamaica is one of many contrasts. The northeast shore is severely eroded by the ocean. There are many small inlets in the rugged coastline, but no coastal plain of any extent. A narrow strip of plains along the northern coast offers calm seas and white sand beaches. Behind the beaches is a flat raised plain of uplifted coral reef.\n\nThe southern coast has small stretches of plains lined by black sand beaches. These are backed by cliffs of limestone where the plateaus end. In many stretches with no coastal plain, the cliffs drop {{convert|300|m|ft}} straight to the sea. In the southwest, broad plains stretch inland for a number of kilometres. The [[Black River (Jamaica)|Black River]] courses {{convert|70|km|mi}} through the largest of these plains. The swamplands of the Great Morass and the Upper Morass fill much of the plains. The western coastline contains the island's finest beaches.\n\n==Climate==\n{{climate chart|[[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]\n|21|30|19\n|21|30|19\n|22|30|20\n|23|31|30\n|24|32|100\n|24|32|74\n|24|33|42\n|24|33|98\n|24|32|114\n|23|32|177\n|23|31|65\n|22|31|47\n|float=left\n|source=[http://www.metservice.gov.jm/documents/Mean_Climatological_Data.pdf Meteorological Service, Jamaica]\n}}\nTwo types of climate are found in Jamaica. An upland tropical climate prevails on the windward side of the mountains, whereas a semiarid climate predominates on the leeward side. Warm trade winds from the east and northeast bring rainfall throughout the year. The rainfall is heaviest from May to October, with peaks in those two months. The average rainfall is {{convert|1960|mm|in|1}} per year. Rainfall is much greater in the mountain areas facing the north and east, however. Where the higher elevations of the John Crow Mountains and the Blue Mountains catch the rain from the moisture-laden winds, rainfall exceeds {{convert|5080|mm|in|0}} per year. Since the southwestern half of the island lies in the rain shadow of the mountains, it has a semiarid climate and receives fewer than {{convert|760|mm|in|1}} of rainfall annually.\n\nTemperatures in Jamaica are fairly constant throughout the year, averaging {{convert|25|to|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in the lowlands and {{convert|15|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} at higher elevations. Temperatures may dip to below {{convert|10|\u00b0C}} at the peaks of the Blue Mountains. The island receives, in addition to the northeast trade winds, refreshing onshore breezes during the day and cooling offshore breezes at night. These are known on Jamaica as the \"Doctor Breeze\" and the \"Undertaker's Breeze,\" respectively.\n\nJamaica lies in the Atlantic [[hurricane belt]]; as a result, the island sometimes experiences significant storm damage. Powerful hurricanes which have hit the island directly causing death and destruction include [[Hurricane Charlie (1951)|Hurricane Charlie]] in 1951 and [[Hurricane Gilbert]] in 1988. Several other powerful hurricanes have passed near to the island with damaging effects. In 1980, for example, [[Hurricane Allen]] destroyed nearly all Jamaica's banana crop. [[Hurricane Ivan]] (2004) swept past the island causing heavy damage and a number of deaths; in 2005, Hurricanes [[Hurricane Dennis|Dennis]] and [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Emily]] brought heavy rains to the island. A Category 4 hurricane, [[Hurricane Dean]], caused some deaths and heavy damage to Jamaica in August 2007.\n\nThe [[Pre-1600 Atlantic hurricane seasons|first recorded]] hurricane to hit Jamaica was in 1519. The island has been struck by tropical cyclones regularly. During two of the coldest periods in the last 250 years (1780s and 1810s), the frequency of hurricanes in the Jamaica region was unusually high. Another peak of activity occurred in the 1910s, the coldest decade of the 20th century. On the other hand, hurricane formation was greatly diminished from 1968 to 1994, which for some reason coincides with the great [[Sahel drought]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The 18th century climate of Jamaica derived from the journals of [[Thomas Thistlewood]], 1750-1786 |last=Chenoweth |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |series=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |volume=93 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-87169-932-X |pages= }}</ref>\n\n==Vegetation and wildlife==\n{{expand section|date=July 2014}}\nAlthough most of Jamaica's native vegetation has been stripped in order to make room for cultivation, some areas have been left virtually undisturbed since the time of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]. Indigenous vegetation can be found along the northern coast from Rio Bueno to [[Discovery Bay, Jamaica|Discovery Bay]], in the highest parts of the Blue Mountains, and in the heart of the Cockpit Country.\n\nAs in the case of vegetation, considerable loss of wildlife has occurred beginning with the settlement of native peoples in the region millennia ago. For example, the only [[pinniped]] ever known to the Caribbean, the [[Caribbean monk seal]] once occurred in Jamaican waters and has now been driven to [[extinction]].<ref>Peter Saundry. 2010.

\n'''Politics''' in '''Jamaica''' takes place in the framework of a [[Representative democracy|representative]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[democracy|democratic]] [[constitutional monarchy]]. The 1962 [[Constitution of Jamaica]] established a [[parliamentary system]] whose political and legal traditions closely follow those of the United Kingdom. As the [[head of state]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] - on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Jamaica]] - appoints a [[governor-general]] as her representative in [[Jamaica]]. The governor-general has a largely ceremonial role. [[Jamaica]] constitutes an independent [[Commonwealth realm]].\n\nThe Constitution vests [[executive power]] in the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]], led by the [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|Prime Minister]]. Executive power is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested both in the [[Forms of government|government]] and in the [[Parliament of Jamaica]].\n\nA bipartisan joint committee of the Jamaican legislature drafted Jamaica's current [[Constitution]] in 1962. That Constitution came into force with the Jamaica Independence Act, 1962 of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], which gave Jamaica political independence.\nConstitutional safeguards include [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of worship]], [[freedom of movement]], and [[freedom of association]].\n\nThe [[judiciary]] operates independently of the executive and the legislature, with [[jurisprudence]] based on [[English common law]].\n\nThe [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] has rated Jamaica as \"[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|flawed democracy]]\" in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016|title=Democracy Index 2016 - The Economist Intelligence Unit|last=solutions|first=EIU digital|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n\n[[File:Parliament.jm.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[House of Representatives of Jamaica]].]]\n[[Parliament of Jamaica|Parliament]] is composed of an appointed [[Jamaican Senate|Senate]] and an elected [[Jamaican House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Thirteen Senators are nominated on the advice of the prime minister and eight on the advice of the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|leader of the opposition]]; a two-thirds super-majority of both chambers is needed for major constitutional amendments. [[General election]]s must be held within five years of the forming of a new government.\n\nThe prime minister may ask the governor-general to call elections sooner, however. The Senate may submit bills, and it also reviews legislation submitted by the House. It may not delay budget bills for more than one month or other bills for more than seven months. The prime minister and the Cabinet are selected from the Parliament. No fewer than two nor more than four members of the Cabinet must be selected from the Senate.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n\n{{Empty section|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Executive branch==\n{{office-table}}\n|[[Monarchy of Jamaica|Monarch]]\n|[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]\n|\n|6 February 1952\n|-\n|[[List of Governors-General of Jamaica|Governor-General]]\n|[[Patrick Allen (Governor-General)|Patrick Allen]]\n|\n|26 February 2009\n|-\n|[[Prime Minister of Jamaica|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Andrew Holness]]\n|[[Jamaica Labour Party|JLP]]\n|3 March 2016\n|-\n|[[Leader of the Opposition (Jamaica)|Leader of the Opposition]]\n|[[Peter Phillips (Jamaican politician)|Peter Phillips]]\n|[[People's National Party|PNP]]\n|2 April 2016\n|}\n\nThe 1962 Constitution established a [[parliamentary system]] based on the [[United Kingdom]] model. As head of state, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] appoints a [[governor-general]], on the advice of the [[prime minister]], as her representative in [[Jamaica]]. The governor-general's role is largely ceremonial.

The Court of Appeal is the highest appellate court in Jamaica. Under certain circumstances, cases may be appealed to Britain's [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. Jamaica's parishes have elected councils that exercise limited powers of local government.\n\nFirearms offences, including possession of unlicensed guns and ammunition, are tried before a dedicated [[Gun Court]] established in 1974.  The Gun Court hears cases ''in camera'' and practices jury trial only for cases of treason or murder.  All other cases are tried by resident magistrates or justices of the [[Supreme Court of Jamaica]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nJamaica is divided in 14 [[Parishes of Jamaica|parishes]]: Clarendon, Hanover, Kingston, Manchester, Portland, Saint Andrew, Saint Ann, Saint Catherine, Saint Elizabeth, Saint James, Saint Mary, Saint Thomas, Trelawny, Westmoreland.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n{{Further|Foreign relations of Jamaica}}\n\n[[Jamaica]] has diplomatic relations with most nations and is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[The Commonwealth]] and the [[Organization of American States]]. Historically, Jamaica has had close ties with the UK. Trade, financial, and cultural relations with the United States are now predominant. Jamaica is linked with the other countries of the English-speaking Caribbean through the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), and more broadly through the [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Jamaica}}\n\n*[[List of Jamaican Ministers of State]]\n*[[Republicanism in Jamaica]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Jamaica topics}}\n{{Americas topic|Politics of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Politics Of Jamaica}}\n[[Category:Politics of Jamaica|*]]", "sha1": "ju6f49j6w8zxe9gxnire3ts59klmbiw"}}]
