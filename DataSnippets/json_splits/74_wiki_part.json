The initial popularity of the network was spurred on by Napster's threatened legal demise in early 2001. This growing surge in popularity revealed the limits of the initial protocol's scalability. In early 2001, variations on the protocol (first implemented in [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and [[closed source software|closed source]] clients) allowed an improvement in scalability. Instead of treating every user as client and server, some users were now treated as ''ultrapeers'', routing search requests and responses for users connected to them.\n\nThis allowed the network to grow in popularity. In late 2001, the Gnutella client [[LimeWire]] Basic became a free and open source. In February 2002, [[Morpheus (software)|Morpheus]], a commercial file sharing group, abandoned its FastTrack-based peer-to-peer software and released a new client based on the free and open source Gnutella client [[GnucDNA#Gnucleus|Gnucleus]].\n\nThe word ''Gnutella'' today refers not to any one project or piece of software, but to the open protocol used by the various clients.\n\nThe name is a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[GNU]]'' and ''[[Nutella]]'', the brand name of an Italian hazelnut flavored spread: supposedly, Frankel and Pepper ate a lot of Nutella working on the original project, and intended to license their finished program under the GNU General Public License. Gnutella is not associated with the [[GNU]] project<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gnutella.html Regarding Gnutella (www.gnu.org)]</ref> or GNU's own peer-to-peer network, [[GNUnet]].\n\nOn October 26, 2010, the popular Gnutella [[Software client|client]] [[LimeWire]] was ordered shut down by Judge [[Kimba Wood]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] when she signed a [[Consent Decree]] to which recording industry plaintiffs and LimeWire had agreed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://templatelab.com/Injunction/|title=Injunction - Template Lab|date=2013-03-16|work=Template Lab|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US}}</ref> This event was the likely cause of a notable drop<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388627,00.asp |title=Indie Labels Sue LimeWire Over Failed Copyright Deal |author=Chloe Albanesius |date=18 July 2011 |work=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff-Davis |quote=In the wake of the LimeWire shutdown, the percentage of U.S. Internet users who access P2P file-sharing services dropped about 7 percent from [its] all-time high in 2007... |accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> in the size of the network, because, while negotiating the [[injunction]], [[LimeWire]] staff had inserted remote-disabling [[Software|code]] into the software.

Since LimeWire was [[free software]], nothing had prevented the creation of [[Fork (software development)|forks]] that omitted the disabling code, as long as LimeWire trademarks were not used. The shutdown did not affect, for example, [[FrostWire]], a fork of LimeWire created in 2004 that carries neither the remote-disabling code nor [[adware]].\n\nOn November 9, 2010, LimeWire was resurrected by a secret team of developers and named [[LimeWire Pirate Edition]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372412,00.asp |title=Report: LimeWire 'Resurrected' by Secret Dev Team |author=Chloe Albanesius |date=9 November 2010 |work=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff-Davis |accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> It was based on LimeWire 5.6 BETA. This version had its server dependencies removed and all the PRO features enabled for free.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:GnutellaQuery.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=A diagram of Gnutella nodes and their connections.|The gnutella search and retrieval protocol]]\nTo envision how Gnutella originally worked, imagine a large circle of users ''(called nodes),'' each of whom has Gnutella client software. On initial startup, the client software must [[Bootstrapping#Computing|bootstrap]] and find at least one other node.  Various methods have been used for this, including a pre-existing address list of possibly working nodes shipped with the software, using updated web caches of known nodes (called ''Gnutella Web Caches''), UDP host caches and, rarely, even [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]. Once connected, the client requests a list of working addresses. The client tries to connect to the nodes it was shipped with, as well as nodes it receives from other clients until it reaches a certain quota. It connects to only that many nodes, locally caching the addresses it has not yet tried and discards the addresses it tried that were invalid.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nWhen the user wants to do a search, the client sends the request to each actively connected node. In version 0.4 of the protocol, the number of actively connected nodes for a client was quite small (around 5), so each node then forwarded the request to all its actively connected nodes, and they, in turn, forwarded the request, and so on, until the packet reached a predetermined number of ''hops'' from the sender (maximum 7).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nSince version 0.6 (2002<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rfc-gnutella.sourceforge.net/src/rfc-0_6-draft.html|title=Gnutella Protocol Development|website=rfc-gnutella.sourceforge.net|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref>), Gnutella is a composite network made of leaf nodes and ultra nodes (also called ultrapeers). The leaf nodes are connected to a small number of ultrapeers (typically 3) while each ultrapeer is connected to more than 32 other ultrapeers. With this higher [[outdegree]], the maximum number of ''hops'' a query can travel was lowered to 4.\n\nLeaves and ultrapeers use the Query Routing Protocol to exchange a Query Routing Table (QRT), a table of 64 [[Binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|Ki]]-slots and up to 2 [[Binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|Mi]]-slots consisting of hashed keywords. A leaf node sends its QRT to each of the ultrapeers it is connected to, and ultrapeers merge the QRT of all their leaves (downsized to 128 [[binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|Ki]]-slots) plus their own QRT (if they share files) and exchange that with their own neighbors. Query routing is then done by hashing the words of the query and seeing whether all of them match in the QRT. Ultrapeers do that check before forwarding a query to a leaf node, and also before forwarding the query to a peer ultra node provided this is the last hope the query can travel.\n\nIf a search request turns up a result, the node that has the result contacts the searcher. In the classic Gnutella protocol, response messages were sent back along the route the query came through, as the query itself did not contain identifying information of the node. This scheme was later revised, so that search results now are delivered over [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) directly to the node that initiated the search, usually an ultrapeer of the node. Thus, in the current protocol, the queries carry the [[IP address]] and port number of either node. This lowers the amount of traffic routed through the Gnutella network, making it significantly more scalable.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIf the user decides to download the file, they negotiate the [[file transfer]]. If the node which has the requested file is not [[Firewall (computing)|firewalled]], the querying node can connect to it directly. However, if the node is firewalled, stopping the source node from receiving incoming connections, the client wanting to download a file sends it a so-called ''push request'' to the server for the remote client to initiate the connection instead (to ''push'' the file). At first, these push requests were routed along the original chain it used to send the query. This was rather unreliable because routes would often break and routed packets are always subject to flow control. Therefore, so-called ''push proxies'' were introduced. These are usually the ultrapeers of a leaf node and they are announced in search results. The client connects to one of these ''push proxies'' using an HTTP request and the proxy sends a ''push request'' to leaf on behalf of the client. Normally, it is also possible to send a push request over UDP to the push proxy which is more efficient than using TCP. Push proxies have two advantages: First, ultrapeer-leaf connections are more stable than routes which makes push requests much more reliable. Second, it reduces the amount of traffic routed through the Gnutella network.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nFinally, when a user disconnects, the client software saves the list of nodes that it was actively connected to and those collected from pong packets for use the next time it attempts to connect so that it becomes independent from any kind of bootstrap services.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn practice, this method of searching on the Gnutella network was often unreliable. Each node is a regular computer user; as such, they are constantly connecting and disconnecting, so the network is never completely stable. Also, the bandwidth cost of searching on Gnutella grew exponentially to the number of connected users,<ref>[http://www.darkridge.com/~jpr5/doc/gnutella.html Why Gnutella Can't Scale. No, Really.] February 2001.</ref> often saturating connections and rendering slower nodes useless. Therefore, search requests would often be dropped, and most queries reached only a very small part of the network. This observation identified the Gnutella network as an [[Scalability|unscalable]] distributed system, and inspired the development of [[distributed hash table]]s, which are much more scalable but support only exact-match, rather than keyword, search.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nTo address the problems of [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]]s, Gnutella developers implemented a tiered system of ''ultrapeers'' and ''leaves''. Instead of all nodes being considered equal, nodes entering into the network were kept at the 'edge' of the network as a leaf, not responsible for any routing, and nodes which were capable of routing messages were promoted to ultrapeers, which would accept leaf connections and route searches and network maintenance messages. This allowed searches to propagate further through the network, and allowed for numerous alterations in the topology which have improved the efficiency and scalability greatly.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAdditionally, gnutella adopted a number of other techniques to reduce traffic overhead and make searches more efficient. Most notable are Query Routing Protocol (QRP) and Dynamic Querying (DQ). With QRP a search reaches only those clients which are likely to have the files, so rare files searches grow vastly more efficient, and with DQ the search stops as soon as the program has acquired enough search results, which vastly reduces the amount of traffic caused by popular searches. [http://gnufu.net Gnutella For Users] has a vast amount of information about these and other improvements to Gnutella in user-friendly style.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nOne of the benefits of having Gnutella so decentralized is to make it very difficult to shut the network down and to make it a network in which the users are the only ones who can decide which content will be available. Unlike [[Napster]], where the entire network relied on the central server, Gnutella cannot be shut down by shutting down any one node and it is impossible for any company to control the contents of the network, which is also due to the many [[free and open source software|free and open source]] Gnutella clients which share the network.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n== Protocol features and extensions ==\nGnutella did once operate on a purely [[query flooding]]-based protocol. The outdated Gnutella version 0.4 [[network protocol]] employs five different packet types, namely<ref>Dye, Mark. McDonald, Rick. Rufi, Antoon W., 'Network Fundamentals', Cisco Networking Academy, Cisco Press, Ch 3. p91</ref>\n\n* ping: discover hosts on network\n* pong: reply to ping\n* query: search for a file\n* query hit: reply to query\n* push: download request for firewalled servants\n\nThese are mainly concerned with searching the Gnutella network. File transfers are handled using [[HTTP]].<ref name=\"Dye, Mark p90\">Dye, Mark. McDonald, Rick. Rufi, Antoon W., 'Network Fundamentals', Cisco Networking Academy, Cisco Press, Ch 3. p90</ref>\n\nThe development of the Gnutella protocol is currently led by the Gnutella Developers Forum (The GDF). Many protocol extensions have been and are being developed by the software vendors and free Gnutella developers of the GDF. These extensions include intelligent query routing, [[SHA-1]] checksums, query hit transmission via [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]], querying via UDP, dynamic queries via [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], file transfers via UDP, [[XML]] metadata, source exchange (also termed ''the download mesh'') and parallel downloading in slices (swarming).<ref name=\"Dye, Mark p90\"/>\n\nThere are efforts to finalize these protocol extensions in the Gnutella 0.6 specification at the Gnutella protocol development website. The Gnutella 0.4 standard, although still being the latest protocol specification since all extensions only exist as proposals so far, is outdated. In fact, it is hard or impossible to connect today with the 0.4 handshakes and according to developers in the GDF, version 0.6 is what new developers should pursue using the [http://gnet-specs.gnufu.net work-in-progress specifications].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe Gnutella protocol remains under development and in spite of attempts to make a clean break with the complexity inherited from the old Gnutella 0.4 and to design a clean new message architecture, it is still one of the most successful file-sharing protocols to date.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n== Software ==\nThe following tables compare general and technical information for a number of applications supporting the Gnutella network.

A sore point with many gnutella developers is that the ''Gnutella2'' name conveys an upgrade or superiority, which led to a ''Gnutella2 flame war''. Other criticism included the use of the gnutella network to bootstrap G2 peers and poor documentation of the G2 protocol. Additionally, the search retries of the [[Shareaza]] client, which was one of the initial G2 clients, could unnecessarily burden the gnutella network.<ref>[http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=100 Gnutella vs. Gnutella2, Part 1] Thomas Mennecke for [[Slyck.com]], February 25, 2003</ref>\n\nThe fork took place in 2002 and both protocols have undergone significant iterations since that time.  G2 has advantages and disadvantages compared to gnutella. An advantage often cited is Gnutella2's hybrid search is more efficient than the original gnutella [[query flooding]], which was replaced by more efficient search methods, starting with Query Routing in 2002, proposed in 2001 by Limewire developers.<ref>[http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/~fwitschel/vorlP2P/literatur/search_methods.pdf A comparison of Peer-to-Peer search methods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926110918/http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/~fwitschel/vorlP2P/literatur/search_methods.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }} Dimitrios Tsoumakos, 2003</ref><ref>[http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~celio/peer2peer/gnutella-related/query-routing-protocol.htm Query Routing for the Gnutella Network proposal] Christopher Rohrs, 2001-12-18</ref><ref>[http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~celio/peer2peer/gnutella-related/query-routing-protocol.htm Query Routing for the Gnutella Network 1.0] Christopher Rohrs, 2002-05-16</ref> An advantage for gnutella is its user population numbers in the millions,<ref name=\"population\"/> whereas the G2 network is approximately an order of magnitude smaller.<ref>[http://crawler.trillinux.org/ G2 Network Statistics] Population ~200,000 January 2010.</ref>  It is difficult to compare the protocols in their current form; the individual client choice will probably have as much an effect to an end user on either network.\n\n== See also ==\n{{wikibooks|The World of Peer-to-Peer (P2P)/Networks and Protocols/Gnutella}}\n* [[Bitzi]]\n* [[Gnutella crawler]]\n* [[GNUnet]]\n\n== References ==\n{{refimprove|date=July 2013}}\n{{Reflist}}\n* Dye, Mark.

Lucas is known for creating the ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' franchises and founding [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Industrial Light & Magic]].

Lucas wrote and directed ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971), based on his earlier student short ''[[Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB]]'', which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s [[Modesto, California]], and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\nLucas' next film, the [[Epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), had a troubled production; however, it was a surprise hit, becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film at the time]], winning six Academy Awards and becoming a [[Cultural impact of Star Wars|cultural phenomenon]]. Lucas produced and cowrote the sequels ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983). With director [[Steven Spielberg]], Lucas created the ''Indiana Jones'' films ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|Temple of Doom]]'' (1984), and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|The Last Crusade]]'' (1989). He also produced and wrote a variety of films through Lucasfilm in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the [[Star Wars#Original trilogy|''Star Wars'' trilogy]] as part of a [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases#1997 Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|Special Edition]], featuring [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|several alterations]]; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with the [[Star Wars|''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy]], comprising ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999), ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005). He later collaborated on served as executive producer for the war film ''[[Red Tails]]'' (2012) and wrote the CGI film ''[[Strange Magic (film)|Strange Magic]]'' (2015).\n\nLucas is one of the American film industry's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards.

Growing up, Lucas had a passion for cars and motor racing, which later inspired his films ''[[1:42.08]]'' and ''[[American Graffiti]]''. Long before Lucas became obsessed with filmmaking, he yearned to be a race-car driver, and he spent most of his high school years racing on the underground circuit at fairgrounds and hanging out at garages.  On June 12, 1962, at age eighteen, while driving his souped-up [[Autobianchi Bianchina]], another driver broadsided him, flipping over his car, nearly killing him, causing him to lose interest in racing as a career.<ref name=pollockskywalking>Pollock, Dale, ''Skywalking: The Life and Films of George Lucas'',  Harmony Books, New York, 1983, {{ISBN|0-517-54677-9}}.</ref><ref>[http://www.oprah.com/own-oprahs-next-chapter/Filmmaker-George-Lucas-Near-Death-Experience-Video \"Filmmaker George Lucas' Near-Death Experience\"], ''oprah.com'', January 22, 2012.

USC was one of the earliest universities to have a school devoted to [[motion picture film]]. During the years at USC, Lucas shared a dorm room with [[Randal Kleiser]]. Along with classmates such as [[Walter Murch]], [[Hal Barwood]], and [[John Milius]], they became a clique of film students known as [[The Dirty Dozen (filmmaking)|The Dirty Dozen]]. He also became good friends with fellow acclaimed student filmmaker and future ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' collaborator, [[Steven Spielberg]]. Lucas was deeply influenced by the Filmic Expression course taught at the school by filmmaker [[Lester Novros]] which concentrated on the non-narrative elements of Film Form like color, light, movement, space, and time. Another inspiration was the Serbian montagist (and dean of the USC Film Department) [[Slavko Vorkapi\u0107]], a film theoretician who made stunning [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] sequences for Hollywood studio features at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]. Vorkapich taught the autonomous nature of the cinematic art form, emphasizing the unique dynamic quality of movement and kinetic energy inherent in motion pictures.\n\n==Film career==\n\n===1965\u201369: Early career===\nLucas saw many inspiring films in class, particularly the visual films coming out of the [[National Film Board of Canada]] like [[Arthur Lipsett]]'s ''[[21-87]]'', the French-Canadian [[cameraman]] [[Jean-Claude Labrecque]]'s [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] ''[[60 Cycles]]'', the work of [[Norman McLaren]], and the documentaries of [[Claude Jutra]]. Lucas fell madly in love with [[pure cinema]] and quickly became prolific at making 16&nbsp;mm nonstory noncharacter visual tone poems and cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 with such titles as ''[[Look at Life (film)|Look at Life]]'', ''[[Herbie (film)|Herbie]]'', ''[[1:42.08]]'', ''[[The Emperor (film)|The Emperor]]'', ''[[Anyone Lived in a Pretty How Town (film)|Anyone Lived in a Pretty (how) Town]]'', ''[[Filmmaker (film)|Filmmaker]]'', and ''[[6-18-67]]''. He was passionate and interested in camerawork and editing, defining himself as a filmmaker as opposed to being a director, and he loved making abstract visual films that created emotions purely through cinema.<ref name=WiredMay2005 />\n\nAfter graduating with a bachelor of [[fine arts]] in film in 1967, he tried joining the [[United States Air Force]] as an officer, but he was immediately turned down because of his numerous speeding tickets. He was later [[Conscription|drafted]] by the Army for military service in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], but he was exempted from service after medical tests showed he had [[diabetes]], the disease that killed his paternal grandfather.\n\nIn 1967, Lucas re-enrolled as a USC graduate student in film production.<ref name=FGL>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/george-lucas |title=George Lucas |date=September 2012 |work=Forbes |accessdate=September 28, 2012}}</ref> Working as a teaching instructor for a class of [[U.S. Navy]] students who were being taught documentary cinematography, Lucas directed the short film ''[[Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB]]'', which won first prize at the 1967\u201368 National Student [[film festival]], and was later adapted into his first full-length feature film, ''[[THX 1138]]''. Lucas was awarded a student scholarship by [[Warner Bros.]] to observe and work on the making of a film of his choosing. The film he chose was ''[[Finian's Rainbow (film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'' (1968) which was being directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who was revered among film school students of the time as a cinema graduate who had \"made it\" in Hollywood.

When he was unable to obtain the rights, he set out to write an original space adventure that would eventually become ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. Despite his success with his previous film, all but one studio turned ''Star Wars'' down.

When ''Star Wars'' became popular once again, in the wake of [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]]'s comic book line and [[Timothy Zahn]]'s [[Thrawn trilogy|trilogy of novels]], Lucas realized that there was still a large audience. His children were older, and with the explosion of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] technology he was now considering returning to directing.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp=294\u201395|ref=kaminski}}\n\nBy 1993, it was announced, in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' among other sources, that Lucas would be making the prequels. He began penning more to the story, indicating that the series would be a tragic one, examining Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side. Lucas also began to change the prequels status relative to the originals; at first they were supposed to be a \"filling-in\" of history tangential to the originals, but now he saw that they could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step towards turning the film series into a \"Saga\".{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp= 299\u2013300|ref=kaminski}} In 1994, Lucas began work on the screenplay of the first prequel, tentatively titled ''Episode I: The Beginning''.\n\nIn 1997, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ''Star Wars,'' Lucas returned to the original trilogy and made numerous modifications using newly available digital technology, releasing them in theaters as the ''Star Wars Special Edition''. For DVD releases in 2004 and Blu-ray releases in 2011, the trilogy received further revisions to make them congruent with the prequel trilogy. Besides the additions to the ''Star Wars'' franchise, Lucas released a ''Director's Cut'' of ''THX 1138'' in 2004, with the film re-cut and containing a number of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] revisions.\n\nThe first ''Star Wars'' prequel was finished and released in 1999 as ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'', which would be the first film Lucas had directed in over two decades.

In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Scots language|Scots]], English, and German, all languages with a long history in this trade and maritime-oriented city, the name Gothenburg is or was (in the case of German) used for the city. Variations of the official German/English name Gothenburg in the city's 1621 charter existed or exist in many languages. The French form of the city name is ''Gothembourg'', but in French texts, the Swedish name ''G\u00f6teborg'' is more frequent. \"Gothenburg\" can also be seen in some older English texts. In Spanish and Portuguese the city is called Gotemburgo. These traditional forms are sometimes replaced with the use of the Swedish ''G\u00f6teborg'', for example by [[The G\u00f6teborg Opera]] and the G\u00f6teborg Ballet. However, ''G\u00f6teborgs universitet'', previously designated as the G\u00f6teborg University in English, changed its name to the [[University of Gothenburg]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.gu.se/english/about_the_university/current/the-university-s-new-english-name.cid778745 |publisher=University of Gothenburg |title=University of Gothenburg&nbsp;\u2013 the University's new English name |date=4 February 2008 |accessdate=18 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728080218/http://www.gu.se/english/about_the_university/current/the-university-s-new-english-name.cid778745 |archivedate=28 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Gothenburg municipality has also reverted to the use of the English name in international contexts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://international.goteborg.se/ |title=City of Gothenburg |publisher=City of Gothenburg |date= |accessdate=15 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the city council launched a new logotype for Gothenburg.

[[Gotland]] is located in the [[Baltic Sea]] to the east of [[\u00d6land]], and is the largest of [[List of islands of Sweden|Sweden's islands]]. Counties are usually sub-divided into municipalities, but Gotland County only consists of one municipality: [[Gotland Municipality]]. Gotland County is the only county in Sweden that is not governed by a [[county council]]. The municipality handles the tasks that are otherwise handled by the county council, mainly health care and public transport. Like other counties, Gotland has a [[County Administrative Boards of Sweden|County Administrative Board]] that oversees implementation of the Swedish state government. Both the County Administrative Board and the municipality have their seat in the largest city [[Visby]], with over 22,000 inhabitants.\n\n== Province ==\nThe provinces of Sweden are no longer officially administrative units, but are used when reporting population size, politics, etc. In this case the province, the county and the municipality all have identical borders and cover an area of 3151&nbsp;km\u00b2<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scb.se/Pages/PublishingCalendarViewInfo____259923.aspx?PublObjId=10420 |publisher=[[Statistics Sweden]] |title=Statistisk \u00e5rsbok f\u00f6r Sverige 2009 |language=Swedish}}</ref> (3151&nbsp;km\u00b2 when excluding the lakes and rivers).\n\n== Administration ==\nGotland is the only [[Counties of Sweden|Swedish county]] that is not administered by a [[County Councils of Sweden|county council]].

Limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy.\n\nAlthough there were wide needs for accurate navigation in military and civilian sectors, almost none of those was seen as justification for the billions of dollars it would cost in research, development, deployment, and operation of a constellation of navigation satellites. During the [[Cold War]] [[arms race]], the nuclear threat to the existence of the United States was the one need that did justify this cost in the view of the United States Congress. This deterrent effect is why GPS was funded. It is also the reason for the ultra-secrecy at that time. The [[nuclear triad]] consisted of the United States Navy's [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) along with [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[strategic bomber]]s and [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). Considered vital to the [[nuclear strategy|nuclear deterrence]] posture, accurate determination of the SLBM launch position was a [[force multiplication|force multiplier]].\n\nPrecise navigation would enable United States [[ballistic missile submarine]]s to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018151253/http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archivedate=October 18, 2007|title=Why Did the Department of Defense Develop GPS?|publisher=Trimble Navigation Ltd|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> The USAF, with two thirds of the nuclear triad, also had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system. The Navy and Air Force were developing their own technologies in parallel to solve what was essentially the same problem.\n\nTo increase the survivability of ICBMs, there was a proposal to use mobile launch platforms (comparable to the Russian [[RT-23 Molodets|SS-24]] and [[RT-2PM Topol|SS-25]]) and so the need to fix the launch position had similarity to the SLBM situation.\n\nIn 1960, the Air Force proposed a radio-navigation system called MOSAIC (MObile System for Accurate ICBM Control) that was essentially a 3-D&nbsp;[[LORAN]]. A follow-on study, Project&nbsp;57, was worked in 1963 and it was \"in this study that the GPS concept was born.\" That same year, the concept was pursued as Project&nbsp;621B, which had \"many of the attributes that you now see in GPS\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|title=Charting a Course Toward Global Navigation|publisher=The Aerospace Corporation|accessdate=October 14, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021101215923/http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|archivedate=November 1, 2002<!--, 01:01:18-->}}</ref> and promised increased accuracy for Air Force bombers as well as ICBMs.\n\nUpdates from the Navy TRANSIT system were too slow for the high speeds of Air Force operation.

The IAF Honors and Awards Committee recognized the uniqueness of the GPS program and the exemplary role it has played in building international collaboration for the benefit of humanity.\n\n==Basic concept of GPS==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}\n\n=== Fundamentals ===\nThe GPS concept is based on time and the known position of GPS specialized [[satellite]]s. The satellites carry very stable [[atomic clocks]] that are synchronized with one another and with the ground clocks. Any drift from true time maintained on the ground is corrected daily. In the same manner, the satellite locations are known with great precision. GPS receivers have clocks as well, but they are less stable and less precise.\n\nGPS satellites continuously transmit data about their current time and position. A GPS receiver monitors multiple satellites and solves equations to determine the precise position of the receiver and its deviation from true time. At a minimum, four satellites must be in view of the receiver for it to compute four unknown quantities (three position coordinates and clock deviation from satellite time).\n\n===More detailed description===\nEach GPS satellite continually broadcasts a signal ([[carrier wave]] with [[modulation]]) that includes:\n* A [[Pseudorandom binary sequence|pseudorandom]] code (sequence of ones and zeros) that is known to the receiver. By time-aligning a receiver-generated version and the receiver-measured version of the code, the time of arrival (TOA) of a defined point in the code sequence, called an epoch, can be found in the receiver clock time scale\n* A message that includes the time of transmission (TOT) of the code epoch (in GPS time scale) and the satellite position at that time\n\nConceptually, the receiver measures the TOAs (according to its own clock) of four satellite signals. From the TOAs and the TOTs, the receiver forms four [[time of flight]] (TOF) values, which are (given the speed of light) approximately equivalent to receiver-satellite ranges. The receiver then computes its three-dimensional position and clock deviation from the four TOFs.\n\nIn practice the receiver position (in three dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] with origin at the Earth's center) and the offset of the receiver clock relative to the GPS time are computed simultaneously, using the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] to process the TOFs.\n\nThe receiver's Earth-centered solution location is usually converted to [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and height relative to an ellipsoidal Earth model. The height may then be further converted to height relative to the [[geoid]] (e.g., [[EGM96]]) (essentially, mean [[sea level]]). These coordinates may be displayed, e.g., on a [[moving map display]], and/or recorded and/or used by some other system (e.g., a vehicle guidance system).\n\n===User-satellite geometry===\nAlthough usually not formed explicitly in the receiver processing, the conceptual time differences of arrival (TDOAs) define the measurement geometry. Each TDOA corresponds to a [[hyperboloid]] of revolution (see [[Multilateration]]). The line connecting the two satellites involved (and its extensions) forms the axis of the hyperboloid. The receiver is located at the point where three hyperboloids intersect.<ref name=\"Abel1\">Abel, J.S. and Chaffee, J.W., \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol:26, no:6, p:748-53, Sept. 1991.</ref><ref name=\"Fang\">Fang, B.T., \"Comments on \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\" by J.S. Abel and J.W. Chaffee\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol:28, no:4, Oct. 1992.</ref>\n\nIt is sometimes incorrectly said that the user location is at the intersection of three spheres. While simpler to visualize, this is the case only if the receiver has a clock synchronized with the satellite clocks (i.e., the receiver measures true ranges to the satellites rather than range differences). There are marked performance benefits to the user carrying a clock synchronized with the satellites. Foremost is that only three satellites are needed to compute a position solution. If it were an essential part of the GPS concept that all users needed to carry a synchronized clock, a smaller number of satellites could be deployed, but the cost and complexity of the user equipment would increase.\n\n===Receiver in continuous operation===\nThe description above is representative of a receiver start-up situation. Most receivers have a [[track algorithm]], sometimes called a ''tracker'', that combines sets of satellite measurements collected at different times\u2014in effect, taking advantage of the fact that successive receiver positions are usually close to each other. After a set of measurements are processed, the tracker predicts the receiver location corresponding to the next set of satellite measurements. When the new measurements are collected, the receiver uses a weighting scheme to combine the new measurements with the tracker prediction. In general, a tracker can (a) improve receiver position and time accuracy, (b) reject bad measurements, and (c) estimate receiver speed and direction.\n\nThe disadvantage of a tracker is that changes in speed or direction can be computed only with a delay, and that derived direction becomes inaccurate when the distance traveled between two position measurements drops below or near the [[random error]] of position measurement. GPS units can use measurements of the [[Doppler shift]] of the signals received to compute velocity accurately.<ref>{{cite book |title=Global Positioning Systems, Inertial Navigation, and Integration |edition=2nd |first1=Mohinder S. |last1=Grewal |first2=Lawrence R. |last2=Weill |first3=Angus P. |last3=Andrews |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2007 |isbn=0-470-09971-2 |pages=92\u201393 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C}}}}, {{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C|page=92 |title=Extract of pages 92\u201393}}</ref> More advanced navigation systems use additional sensors like a [[compass]] or an [[inertial navigation system]] to complement GPS.\n\n===Non-navigation applications===\n{{for|a list of applications|#Applications}}\nIn typical GPS operation as a navigator, four or more satellites must be visible to obtain an accurate result. The solution of the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a more precise and possibly impractical receiver based clock. Applications for GPS such as [[time transfer]], traffic signal timing, and [[IS-95#Physical layer|synchronization of cell phone base stations]], make use of this cheap and highly accurate timing. Some GPS applications use this time for display, or, other than for the basic position calculations, do not use it at all.\n\nAlthough four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known [[altitude]], [[dead reckoning]], [[inertial navigation system|inertial navigation]], or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Continuous Navigation Combining GPS with Sensor-Based Dead Reckoning|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111202317/http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archivedate=November 11, 2006|date=April 1, 2005|author1=Georg zur Bonsen |author2=Daniel Ammann |author3=Michael Ammann |author4=Etienne Favey |author5=Pascal Flammant |publisher=GPS World}}</ref><ref name=\"NAVGPS\">{{cite web|title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction|format=PDF|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf|publisher=United States Government}} Chapter 7</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=GPS Support Notes|url=http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|format=PDF|date=January 19, 2007|accessdate=November 10, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327051208/http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|archivedate=March 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}\nThe current GPS consists of three major segments.

What is more, the OMA SUPL A-GPS standard has enabled lower cost deployment of A-GPS services that ensure a better and more consistent user experience necessary for the mass consumer market. The SUPL A-GPS standard allows network operators or handset manufacturers to deploy assistance services that reduce the time to first fix, lowers the power consumption, and enhances the sensitivity of the GPS receiver. The SUPL standard uses User Plane communication channels such as SMS and GPRS to transport the aiding data, as opposed to the control plane channels in networks, thereby reducing the load on the networks, as well as complexity and cost of service deployment. New business models have also become possible, ranging from hosted services for operators that want to minimize capital investments, to services deployed by handset vendors for end-users that cannot get similar services from their network operator yet.\n\nThe major handset software platforms and operating systems are evolving, ensuring easier integration of GPS functionality for handset manufacturers and more powerful features for application developers. Along with the improving performance of handsets, in terms of screen size, processing power and memory size, current handsets thus provide much better platforms for location-enabled applications and services than before.\n\nThe GPS value-chain was reshaped considerably in 2007 as several specialist GPS technology developers were acquired by wireless chipset vendors. These transactions are likely to enhance the possibilities to meet handset manufacturers' demand for integrated connectivity solutions that include GPS at ever lower price points to enable true mass market deployment.\n\nSales of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets grew to about 24.5 million units in 2007 according to independent analyst firm Berg Insight. Although the number is very small in comparison with the 150 million GPS-enabled CDMA handsets sold, the number is growing rapidly. Berg Insight estimates that shipments of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets will grow to 370&nbsp;million units in 2012, the equivalent of more than 26 percent of all GSM/WCDMA handsets sold that year. Including CDMA handsets, GPS-enabled handsets sales are estimated to reach about 560&nbsp;million, or 35&nbsp;percent of total handset shipments in 2012.\n\n-->\n\n====Restrictions on civilian use====\nThe U.S. government controls the export of some civilian receivers.

Each complete message takes 750 seconds (12 1/2 minutes) to complete. The message structure has a basic format of a 1500-bit-long frame made up of five subframes, each subframe being 300 bits (6 seconds) long. Subframes 4 and 5 are [[commutation (telemetry)|subcommutated]] 25 times each, so that a complete data message requires the transmission of 25 full frames. Each subframe consists of ten words, each 30 bits long. Thus, with 300 bits in a subframe times 5 subframes in a frame times 25 frames in a message, each message is 37,500 bits long. At a transmission rate of 50-bit/s, this gives 750 seconds to transmit an entire [[GPS signals#Almanac|almanac message (GPS)]]. Each 30-second frame begins precisely on the minute or half-minute as indicated by the atomic clock on each satellite.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gpsinformation.net/gpssignal.htm |title=Satellite message format |publisher=Gpsinformation.net |accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe first subframe of each frame encodes the week number and the time within the week,<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter H.

Although LightSquared had applied for a license to operate in the 1525 to 1559 band as early as 2003 and it was put out for public comment, the FCC asked LightSquared to form a study group with the GPS community to test GPS receivers and identify issue that might arise due to the larger signal power from the LightSquared terrestrial network. The GPS community had not objected to the LightSquared (formerly MSV and SkyTerra) applications until November 2010, when LightSquared applied for a modification to its Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) authorization. This filing (SAT-MOD-20101118-00239) amounted to a request to run several orders of magnitude more power in the same frequency band for terrestrial base stations, essentially repurposing what was supposed to be a \"quiet neighborhood\" for signals from space as the equivalent of a cellular network. Testing in the first half of 2011 has demonstrated that the impact of the lower 10&nbsp;MHz of spectrum is minimal to GPS devices (less than 1% of the total GPS devices are affected).

If the almanac information is not in memory, the receiver enters a search mode until a lock is obtained on one of the satellites. To obtain a lock, it is necessary that there be an unobstructed line of sight from the receiver to the satellite. The receiver can then acquire the almanac and determine the satellites it should listen for. As it detects each satellite's signal, it identifies it by its distinct C/A&nbsp;code pattern. There can be a delay of up to 30&nbsp;seconds before the first estimate of position because of the need to read the ephemeris data.\n\nProcessing of the navigation message enables the determination of the time of transmission and the satellite position at this time.

The ''x, y,'' and ''z'' components of satellite position and the time sent are designated as [''x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, z<sub>i</sub>, s<sub>i</sub>''] where the subscript ''i'' denotes the satellite and has the value 1, 2, ..., ''n'', where ''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;4.

The receiver clock bias is the same for all received satellite signals (assuming the satellite clocks are all perfectly synchronized). The message's transit time is {{nobreak|1=''t&#771;<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''b'' \u2212 ''s<sub>i</sub>''}}, where ''s<sub>i</sub>'' is the satellite time.

Receivers usually calculate a running estimate of the error in the calculated position. This is done by multiplying the basic resolution of the receiver by quantities called the [[Dilution of precision (navigation)|geometric dilution of position]] (GDOP) factors, calculated from the relative sky directions of the satellites used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#Gdop|title=Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) and Visibility|first=Peter H.|last=Dana|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder|accessdate=July 7, 2008}}</ref> The receiver location is expressed in a specific coordinate system, such as latitude and longitude using the [[WGS 84]] [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] or a country-specific system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#PosVelTime|title=Receiver Position, Velocity, and Time|author=Peter H.

Geometrical interpretations can enhance the understanding of these solution methods.\n\n====Spheres====\nThe measured ranges, called pseudoranges, contain clock errors. In a simplified idealization in which the ranges are synchronized, these true ranges represent the radii of spheres, each centered on one of the transmitting satellites.

The locus of points having a constant difference in distance to two points (here, two satellites) is a [[hyperbola]] on a plane and a [[hyperboloid of revolution]] in 3D space (see [[Multilateration]]). Thus, from four pseudorange measurements, the receiver can be placed at the intersection of the surfaces of three hyperboloids each with [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] at a pair of satellites. With additional satellites, the multiple intersections are not necessarily unique, and a best-fitting solution is sought instead.<ref name=\"Abel1\"/><ref name=\"Fang\"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Gilbert Strang|author2=Kai Borre|title=Linear Algebra, Geodesy, and GPS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjNwWUY8jx4C&pg=PA449|year=1997|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-0-9614088-6-2|pages=448\u2013449}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Audun Holme|title=Geometry: Our Cultural Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXwQGo8jyHUC&pg=PA338|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14441-7|page=338}}</ref><ref name=\"HWLW\">{{cite book|author1=B.

Such augmentation systems are generally named or described based on how the information arrives. Some systems transmit additional error information (such as clock drift, ephemera, or [[ionospheric delay]]), others characterize prior errors, while a third group provides additional navigational or vehicle information.\n\nExamples of augmentation systems include the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS), [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS), [[Differential GPS]] (DGPS), [[inertial navigation system]]s (INS) and [[Assisted GPS]]. The standard accuracy of about {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} can be augmented to {{convert|3|\u2013|5|m|ft|sp=us}} with DGPS, and to about {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} with WAAS.<ref>{{cite book|title=GPS For Dummies |first1=Joel |last1=McNamara |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2008 |isbn=0-470-45785-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC&pg=PA59|page=59}}</ref>\n\n===Precise monitoring===\nAccuracy can be improved through precise monitoring and measurement of existing GPS signals in additional or alternative ways.\n\nThe largest remaining error is usually the unpredictable delay through the [[ionosphere]]. The spacecraft broadcast ionospheric model parameters, but some errors remain. This is one reason GPS spacecraft transmit on at least two frequencies, L1 and L2. Ionospheric delay is a well-defined function of frequency and the [[total electron content]] (TEC) along the path, so measuring the arrival time difference between the frequencies determines TEC and thus the precise ionospheric delay at each frequency.\n\nMilitary receivers can decode the P(Y) code transmitted on both L1 and L2. Without decryption keys, it is still possible to use a ''codeless'' technique to compare the P(Y) codes on L1 and L2 to gain much of the same error information. This technique is slow, so it is currently available only on specialized surveying equipment. In the future, additional civilian codes are expected to be transmitted on the L2 and L5&nbsp;frequencies (see [[GPS modernization]]). All users will then be able to perform dual-frequency measurements and directly compute ionospheric delay errors.\n\nA second form of precise monitoring is called ''Carrier-Phase Enhancement'' (CPGPS). This corrects the error that arises because the pulse transition of the [[pseudorandom noise|PRN]] is not instantaneous, and thus the [[cross-correlation|correlation]] (satellite\u2013receiver sequence matching) operation is imperfect. CPGPS uses the L1 carrier wave, which has a [[frequency|period]] of <math> \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1575.42 \\times 10^6} = 0.63475\\,\\mathrm{ns} \\approx 1\\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, which is about one-thousandth of the C/A&nbsp;Gold code bit period of <math> \\frac{1\\, \\mathrm{s}}{1023 \\times 10^3} = 977.5 \\, \\mathrm{ns}   \\approx 1000 \\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, to act as an additional [[clock signal]] and resolve the uncertainty. The phase difference error in the normal GPS amounts to {{convert|2|\u2013|3|m|ft|sp=us|sigfig=1}} of ambiguity. CPGPS working to within 1% of perfect transition reduces this error to {{convert|3|cm|in|sp=us}} of ambiguity. By eliminating this error source, CPGPS coupled with DGPS normally realizes between {{convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|sp=us}} of absolute accuracy.\n\n''[[Relative Kinematic Positioning]]'' (RKP) is a third alternative for a precise GPS-based positioning system. In this approach, determination of range signal can be resolved to a precision of less than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}}. This is done by resolving the number of cycles that the signal is transmitted and received by the receiver by using a combination of differential GPS (DGPS) correction data, transmitting GPS signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical tests\u2014possibly with processing in real-time ([[Real Time Kinematic|real-time kinematic positioning]], RTK).\n\n===Timekeeping {{anchor|GPS time|GPS time and date}}===\n\n====Leap seconds====\nWhile most clocks derive their time from [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), the atomic clocks on the satellites are set to GPS time (GPST; see the page of [[United States Naval Observatory]]). The difference is that GPS time is not corrected to match the rotation of the Earth, so it does not contain [[leap second]]s or other corrections that are periodically added to UTC. GPS time was set to match UTC in 1980, but has since diverged. The lack of corrections means that GPS time remains at a constant offset with [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI) (TAI \u2212 GPS = 19&nbsp;seconds). Periodic corrections are performed to the on-board clocks to keep them synchronized with ground clocks.<ref>{{cite web|title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction|format=PDF|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf }} Section 1.2.2</ref>\n\nThe GPS navigation message includes the difference between GPS time and UTC. As of January 2017, GPS time is 18 seconds ahead of UTC because of the leap second added to UTC on December 31, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Notice Advisory to Navstar Users (NANU) 2016069 |accessdate=June 25, 2017 |url=https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?Do=gpsArchives&path=nanu&year=2016&file=25665&type=messageBody--nanuId--NANUS&name=2016069.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525063405/https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?Do=gpsArchives&path=nanu&year=2016&file=25665&type=messageBody--nanuId--NANUS&name=2016069.txt |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |publisher=GPS Operations Center}}</ref> Receivers subtract this offset from GPS time to calculate UTC and specific timezone values. New GPS units may not show the correct UTC time until after receiving the UTC offset message. The GPS-UTC offset field can accommodate 255 leap seconds (eight bits).\n\n====Accuracy====\nGPS time is theoretically accurate to about 14 nanoseconds, due to the [[clock drift]] that atomic clocks experience in GPS transmitters.<sup>per, or relative to, what?</sup><ref>{{cite journal|author=David W. Allan |url=http://www.allanstime.com/Publications/DWA/Science_Timekeeping/TheScienceOfTimekeeping.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BMeuPXJs?url=http://www.allanstime.com/Publications/DWA/Science_Timekeeping/TheScienceOfTimekeeping.pdf |deadurl=no |title=The Science of Timekeeping |publisher=Hewlett Packard |year=1997 |archivedate=October 12, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref> Most receivers lose accuracy in the interpretation of the signals and are only accurate to 100 nanoseconds.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.pdana.com/PHDWWW_files/gpsrole.pdf|title=The Role of GPS in Precise Time and Frequency Dissemination|publisher=GPSworld|date=July\u2013August 1990|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atomic-clock.galleon.eu.com/support/gps-time-accuracy.html|title=GPS time accurate to 100 nanoseconds|publisher=Galleon|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Format====\nAs opposed to the year, month, and day format of the [[Gregorian calendar]], the GPS date is expressed as a week number and a seconds-into-week number. The week number is transmitted as a ten-[[bit]] field in the C/A and P(Y) navigation messages, and so it becomes zero again every 1,024&nbsp;weeks (19.6&nbsp;years). GPS week zero started at 00:00:00&nbsp;UTC (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI) on January 6, 1980, and the week number became zero again for the first time at 23:59:47&nbsp;UTC on August 21, 1999 (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI on August 22, 1999). To determine the current Gregorian date, a GPS receiver must be provided with the approximate date (to within 3,584&nbsp;days) to correctly translate the GPS date signal. To address this concern the modernized GPS navigation message uses a 13-bit field that only repeats every 8,192&nbsp;weeks (157&nbsp;years), thus lasting until 2137 (157&nbsp;years after GPS week zero).\n\n===Carrier phase tracking (surveying)===\nAnother method that is used in surveying applications is carrier phase tracking. The period of the carrier frequency multiplied by the speed of light gives the wavelength, which is about 0.19&nbsp;meters for the L1&nbsp;carrier. Accuracy within 1% of wavelength in detecting the leading edge reduces this component of pseudorange error to as little as 2&nbsp;millimeters. This compares to 3&nbsp;meters for the C/A code and 0.3&nbsp;meters for the P&nbsp;code.\n\n2&nbsp;millimeter accuracy requires measuring the total phase\u2014the number of waves multiplied by the wavelength plus the fractional wavelength, which requires specially equipped receivers. This method has many surveying applications. It is accurate enough for real-time tracking of the very slow motions of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], typically {{convert|0|-|100|mm|in|0|abbr=in}} per year.\n\nTriple differencing followed by numerical root finding, and a mathematical technique called [[least squares]] can estimate the position of one receiver given the position of another. First, compute the difference between satellites, then between receivers, and finally between epochs. Other orders of taking differences are equally valid. Detailed discussion of the errors is omitted.\n\nThe satellite carrier total phase can be measured with ambiguity as to the number of cycles. Let <math>\\ \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> denote the phase of the carrier of satellite ''j'' measured by receiver ''i'' at time <math>\\ \\ t_k </math>. This notation shows the meaning of the subscripts ''i, j,'' and ''k.'' The receiver (''r''), satellite (''s''), and time (''t'') come in alphabetical order as arguments of <math>\\ \\phi </math> and to balance readability and conciseness, let <math>\\ \\phi_{i,j,k} = \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> be a concise abbreviation. Also we define three functions, :<math>\\ \\Delta^r, \\Delta^s, \\Delta^t </math>, which return differences between receivers, satellites, and time points, respectively. Each function has variables with three subscripts as its arguments. These three functions are defined below. If <math>\\  \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math> is a function of the three integer arguments, ''i, j,'' and ''k'' then it is a valid argument for the functions, :<math>\\ \\Delta^r, \\Delta^s, \\Delta^t </math>, with the values defined as\n\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^r(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i+1,j,k} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>,\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^s(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i,j+1,k} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>, and\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i,j,k+1} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>&nbsp;.\n\nAlso if <math>\\  \\alpha_{i,j,k}\\ and\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} </math> are valid arguments for the three functions and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants then\n<math>\\ ( a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} ) </math> is a valid argument with values defined as\n\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^r(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n}) = a \\ \\Delta^r(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^r(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>,\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^s(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} )= a \\ \\Delta^s(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^s(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>, and\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} )= a \\ \\Delta^t(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^t(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>&nbsp;.\n\nReceiver clock errors can be approximately eliminated by differencing the phases measured from satellite&nbsp;1 with that from satellite&nbsp;2 at the same epoch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm |title=Between-Satellite Differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051358/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> This difference is designated as <math>\\ \\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}) =  \\phi_{1,2,1} - \\phi_{1,1,1}</math>\n\nDouble differencing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm |title=Double differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051809/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> computes the difference of receiver&nbsp;1's satellite difference from that of receiver&nbsp;2.

This eliminates the ambiguity associated with the integral number of wavelengths in carrier phase provided this ambiguity does not change with time. Thus the triple difference result eliminates practically all clock bias errors and the integer ambiguity. Atmospheric delay and satellite ephemeris errors have been significantly reduced. This triple difference is:\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\Delta^r(\\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}))) </math>\n\nTriple difference results can be used to estimate unknown variables. For example, if the position of receiver&nbsp;1 is known but the position of receiver&nbsp;2 unknown, it may be possible to estimate the position of receiver&nbsp;2 using numerical root finding and least squares. Triple difference results for three independent time pairs may be sufficient to solve for receiver&nbsp;2's three position components. This may require a numerical procedure.<ref name=\"NR1\">chapter on root finding and nonlinear sets of equations</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=William H.

This initial value can probably be provided from the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Such a reasonable estimate can be key to successful multidimensional root finding. Iterating from three time pairs and a fairly good initial value produces one observed triple difference result for receiver&nbsp;2's position. Processing additional time pairs can improve accuracy, overdetermining the answer with multiple solutions. Least squares can estimate an overdetermined system. Least squares determines the position of receiver&nbsp;2 that best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver&nbsp;2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares.\n\n==Regulatory spectrum issues concerning GPS receivers==\nIn the United States, GPS receivers are regulated under the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|Part 15]] rules.

After the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the German princes proclaimed the founding of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], uniting all the scattered parts of Germany except Austria and the German-speaking parts of Switzerland.

Under [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], Germany, like other European powers, took an [[New Imperialism|imperialistic]] course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries. Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed.

Subsequently, the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance of 1882]] included Italy, completing a Central European geographic alliance that illustrated German, Austrian and Italian fears of incursions against them by France and/or Russia.

The city is located in the south-central part of the country, nestled in a mountain valley called Valle de la Ermita ({{lang-en|Hermitage Valley}}). It is estimated that its population is about 1 million. Guatemala City is also the capital of the Municipality of Guatemala and of the [[Guatemala (department)|Guatemala Department]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Cerritodelcarmen.jpg|thumb|left|\"Cerrito del Carmen\" church. First construction ever built by the Spaniards in the valley that eventually became Guatemala City.]]\n{{Main|History of Guatemala City|Timeline of Guatemala City}}\n\nHuman settlement on the present site of Guatemala City began with the [[Maya people|Maya]] who built a city at [[Kaminaljuyu]]. The [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Spanish colonists]] established a small town, which was made a capital city in 1775. At this period the Central Square with the [[Cathedral of Guatemala City|Cathedral]] and Royal Palace were constructed. After [[Act of Independence of Central America|Central American independence from Spain]] the city became the capital of the [[United Provinces of Central America]] in 1821.\n\nThe 19th century saw the construction of the monumental [[Carrera Theater (Guatemala)|Carrera Theater]] in the 1850s, and the Presidential Palace in the 1890s. At this time the city was expanding around the ''30 de junio'' Boulevard and elsewhere, displacing [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] settlements from the ancient site. [[1917 Guatemala earthquake|Earthquakes]] in 1917&ndash;1918 destroyed many historic structures. Under [[Jorge Ubico]] in the 1930s a [[hippodrome]] and many new public buildings were constructed, although peripheral poor neighborhoods that formed after the 1917&ndash;1918 earthquakes continued to lack basic amenities.\n\nDuring the [[Guatemalan Civil War]], terror attacks beginning with the [[burning of the Spanish Embassy]] in 1980 led to severe destruction and loss of life in the city. In May 2010 two disasters struck: the eruption of the [[Pacaya]] volcano, and two days later [[Tropical Storm Agatha (2010)|Tropical Storm Agatha]].\n\n==Contemporary times==\n[[File:Guatemala City (663).jpg|thumb|Guatemala City from Carretera a El Salvador]]\nGuatemala City serves as the economic, governmental, and cultural epicenter of the nation of Guatemala. The city also functions as Guatemala's main transportation hub, hosting an international airport, [[La Aurora International Airport]], and serving as the origination or end points for most of Guatemala's major highways. The city, with its robust economy, attracts hundreds of thousands of rural migrants from Guatemala's interior hinterlands and serves as the main entry point for most foreign immigrants seeking to settle in Guatemala.\n\nIn addition to a wide variety of restaurants, hotels, shops, and a modern [[Bus rapid transit|BRT]] transport system ([[Transmetro]]), the city is home to many art galleries, theaters, sports venues and museums (including some fine collections of [[Pre-Columbian]] art) and provides a growing number of cultural offerings. Guatemala City not only possesses a history and culture unique to the Central American region, it also furnishes all the modern amenities of a world class city, ranging from an [[IMAX Theater]] to the \u00cdcaro film festival ([[Festival \u00cdcaro]]), where independent films produced in Guatemala and Central America are debuted.\n\n==Structure and growth==\n[[File:Plaza Espa\u00f1a Cd Guatemala a Noche.jpg|thumb|left|Plaza Espa\u00f1a at Night]]\n[[File:guatemala city aerial night b.JPG|thumb|Evening view from a plane]]\n[[File:CC.MIRAFLORES.JPG|thumb|left|C.C. Miraflores]]\n[[File:Paseo Cayal\u00e1.jpg|thumb|Paseo Cayal\u00e1]]\n\n\n\nGuatemala City is located in the mountainous highlands of the country, between the Pacific coastal plain to the south and the northern lowlands of the Peten region.\n\nThe city's metropolitan area has recently grown very rapidly and has absorbed most of the neighboring municipalities of Villa Nueva, San Miguel Petapa, [[Mixco]], San Juan Sacatepequez, San Jos\u00e9 Pinula, Santa Catarina Pinula, Fraijanes, San Pedro Ayampuc, Amatitl\u00e1n, Villa Canales, Palencia and Chinautla forming what is now known as the [[Guatemala City Metropolitan Area]].\n\nThe city is subdivided into 22 zones designed by the urban engineering of [[Ra\u00fal Aguilar Batres]], each one with its own streets and avenues, making it pretty easy to find addresses in the city. Zones are numbered 1-25 with Zones 20, 22 and 23 not existing as they would have fallen in two other municipalities territory.{{sfn|Municipalidad de Guatemala|2008|p=}} Addresses are assigned according to the street or avenue number, followed by a dash and the number of metres it is away from the intersection{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} further simplifying address location. The zones are assigned in a spiral form starting in downtown Guatemala city.\n\nZone One is the Historic Center, (Centro Hist\u00f3rico), lying in the very heart of the city, the location of many important historic buildings including the [[National Palace (Guatemala)|Palacio Nacional de la Cultura]] (National Palace of Culture), the Metropolitan Cathedral, the National Congress, the [[Casa Presidencial (Guatemala)|Casa Presidencial]] (Presidential House), the National Library and Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n (Constitution Plaza, old Central Park). Efforts to revitalize this important part of the city have been undertaken by the municipal government.\n\nBesides the parks, the city offers a portfolio of entertainment in the region, focused on the so-called Zona Viva and the Calzada Roosevelt as well as four degrees North. Casino activity is considerable, with several located in different parts of the Zona Viva. The area around the East market is being redeveloped.\n\nWithin the financial district are the tallest buildings in the country including: [[Club Premier]], Tinttorento, Atlantis building, [[Atrium Building (Guatemala)|Atrium]], [[Tikal Futura]], Building of Finances, Towers Building Batteries, Torres Botticelli, Tadeus, building of the INTECAP, Royal Towers, Towers Geminis, Industrial Bank towers, Holiday Inn Hotel, Premier of the Americas, among many others to be used for offices, apartments etc. Also included  are projects such as Zona Pradera and Interamerica\u00b4s World Financial Center.\n\nOne of the most outstanding mayors was the engineer Martin Prado V\u00e9lez, who took over in 1949, and ruled the city during the reformist Presidents [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo]] and [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzman]], although he was not a member of the ruling party at the time and was elected due his well-known capabilities. Of cobanero origin, married with Marta Cobos, he studied at the [[University of San Carlos]]; under his tenure, among other modernist works of the city, infrastructure projects included El Incienso bridge, the construction of the Roosevelt Avenue, the main road axis from East to West of the city, the town hall building, and numerous road works which meant the widening of the colonial city, its order in the cardinal points and the generation of a ring road with the first cloverleaf interchange in the city.{{sfn|Mor\u00e1n M\u00e9rida|1994|p=9}}\n\nIn an attempt to control the rapid growth of the city, the municipal government (Municipalidad de Guatemala) headed by longtime Mayor [[\u00c1lvaro Arz\u00fa]], has implemented a plan to focus growth along important arterial roads and apply [[Transit-oriented development]] (TOD) characteristics. This plan denominated POT  (Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial) aims to allow taller building structures of mixed uses to be built next to large arterial roads and gradually decline in height and density moving away from such. It is also worth mentioning, that due to the airport being in the south of the city, height limits based on aeronautical considerations have been applied to the construction code. This limits the maximum height for a building, at {{convert|60|m|abbr=off}} in Zone 10, up to {{convert|95|m|abbr=off}} in Zone 1.{{sfn|Municipalidad de Guatemala|2008|p=}}\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Guatemala City, Guatemala.JPG|thumb|Aerial View of Guatemala City]]\nIt is estimated that the population of Guatemala City proper is about 1 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oj.gob.gt/estadisticaj/reportes/poblacion-total-por-municipio(1).pdf|title=Guatemala: Estimaciones de la Poblaci\u00f3n total por municipio.

The numerous Mayan languages are now spoken in certain quarters of Guatemala City, making the city a linguistically rich area.  Foreigners and foreign immigrants comprise the final distinct group of Guatemala City inhabitants, representing a very small minority among the city's citizens.{{sfn|INE|2013|p=13}}\n\nDue to mass migration from impoverished rural districts wracked with political instability, Guatemala City's population has exploded since the 1970s, severely straining the existing bureaucratic and physical infrastructure of the city. As a result, chronic traffic congestion, shortages of safe potable water in some areas of the city, and a sudden and prolonged surge in crime have become perennial problems. The infrastructure, although continuing to grow and improve in some areas,{{sfn|Mor\u00e1n M\u00e9rida|1994|p=14}} it is lagging in relation to the increasing population of those less fortunate.{{sfn|Mor\u00e1n M\u00e9rida|1994|p=14-17}} Guatemala City is not unique in facing and tackling problems all too common among rapidly expanding cities around the world.\n\n==Communications==\nGuatemala City is headquarters to many communications and telecom companies, among them Tigo, Claro-Telgua, and Movistar-Telef\u00f3nica. These companies also offer cable television, internet services and telephone access. Due to Guatemala City's large and concentrated consumer base in comparison to the rest of the country, these telecom and communications companies provide most of their services and offerings within the confines of the city.  There are also seven local television channels, in addition to numerous international channels.  The international channels range from children's programming, like [[Nickelodeon (Latin America)|Nickelodeon]] and the [[Disney Channel (Latin America)|Disney Channel]], to more adult offerings, such as [[E!]] and [[HBO (international)#Latin_America|HBO]].  While international programming is dominated by entertainment from the United States, domestic programming is dominated by shows from Mexico.  Due to its small and relatively income-restricted domestic market, Guatemala City produces very little in the way of its own programming outside of local news and sports.\n\n==Economy and Finance==\nGuatemala City, as the capital, is home to Guatemala's central bank, from which Guatemala's monetary and fiscal policies are formulated and promulgated.  Guatemala City is also headquarters to numerous regional private banks, among them CitiBank, Banco Agromercantil, Banco Promerica, Banco Industrial, Banco GyT Continental, Banco de Antigua, Banco Reformador, Banrural, Grupo Financiero de Occidente, BAC Credomatic, and Banco Internacional.  By far the richest and most powerful regional economy within Guatemala, Guatemala City is the largest market for goods and services, which provides the greatest number of investment opportunities for public and private investors in all of Guatemala.  Financing for these investments is provided by the regional private banks, as well as by foreign direct and capital investment, mostly from the United States.  Guatemala City's ample consumer base and sophisticated service sector is represented by the large department store chains present in the city, among them Siman, Hiper Paiz & Paiz (Walmart), Price Smart, ClubCo, Cemaco, Sears and Office Depot.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Banco deGuatemala.JPG|Bank of Guatemala.\nFile:Banrural.jpg|Banrural Bank.\nFile:ZONAPRADERA.JPG|Pradera Zone.\nFile:Banco Agromercantilguate.jpg|Agromercantil Bank.\nFile:BANCO GYT CONTINENTAL.JPG|G&T Continental Bank.\nFile:Credito Hipotecario Nacional.jpg|CHN Bank.\n</gallery>\n\n==Places of interest by zones==\n\nGuatemala City is divided into 22 zones in accordance with the urban layout plan designed by [[Ra\u00fal Aguilar Batres]].  Each zone has its own streets and avenues, facilitating navigation within the city. Zones are numbered 1 through 25.  However, numbers 20, 22 and 23 have not been designated to zones, thus these zones do not exist within the city proper.{{sfn|Municipalidad de Guatemala|2008|p=}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto; font-size:0.9em;\" \n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n!

La Aurora serves as Guatemala's principal air hub.\n*Public transport is provided by buses and supplemented by a BRT system. The three main highways that bisect and serve Guatemala start in the city. (CA9 Transoceanic Highway - Puerto San Jose to Puerto Santo Tomas de Castilla-, CA1 Panamerican Highway - from the Mexican border to Salvadorian border - and to Peten.)  Construction of freeways and underpasses by the municipal government, the implementation of [[reversible lane]]s during peak rush-hour traffic, as well as the establishment of the Department of Metropolitan Transit Police (PMT), has helped improve traffic flow in the city.  Despite these municipal efforts, the Guatemala City metropolitan area still faces growing traffic congestion.\n*A BRT ([[Bus Rapid Transit]]) system called [[Transmetro]], consisting of special-purpose lanes for high-capacity buses, began operating in 2007, and aimed to improve traffic flow in the city through the implementation of an efficient mass transit system. The system consists of five lines. It is expected to be expanded around 10 lines, with some over-capacity expected lines being considered for Light Metro or Heavy Metro.\n\nTraditional buses are now required to discharge passengers at transfer stations at the city's edge to board the Transmetro. This is being implemented as new Transmetro lines become established. In conjunction with the new mass transit implementation in the city, there is also a prepaid bus card system called [[Transurbano]] that is being implemented in the metro area to limit cash handling for the transportation system. A new fleet of buses tailored for this system has been purchased from a Brazilian firm.\n\n==Universities and schools==\n{{See also|List of universities in Guatemala}}\nGuatemala City is home to ten universities, among them the oldest institution of higher education in Central America, the [[University of San Carlos of Guatemala]].  Founded in 1676, the Universidad de San Carlos is older than all North American universities except for [[Harvard University]].\n\nThe other nine institutions of higher education to be found in Guatemala City include the Universidad Mariano G\u00e1lvez, the Universidad Panamericana, the Universidad Mesoamericana, the Universidad Rafael Landivar, the [[Universidad Francisco Marroqu\u00edn]], the [[Universidad del Valle de Guatemala|Universidad del Valle]], the [[Universidad del Istmo]], [[Galileo University|Universidad Galileo]], Universidad da Vinci and the Universidad Rural.  Whereas these nine named universities are private, the Universidad de San Carlos remains the only public institution of higher learning.\n\n==Sports==\nGuatemala City possesses several sportsgrounds and is home to many sports clubs. [[Soccer|Football]] is the most popular sport, with [[CSD Municipal]], [[Aurora FC]] and [[Comunicaciones]] being the main clubs. The [[Estadio Mateo Flores]], located in the Zone 5 of the city, is the largest stadium in the country, followed in capacity by the [[Estadio Cementos Progreso]], [[Estadio del Ej\u00e9rcito]] & [[Estadio El Tr\u00e9bol]]. An important multi-functional hall is the [[Domo Polideportivo de la CDAG]].\n\nThe city has hosted several promotional functions and some international sports events: in 1950 it hosted the [[1950 Central American and Caribbean Games|VI Central American and Caribbean Games]], and in 2000 the [[FIFA Futsal World Championship]].

The city has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'') bordering on a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwb''). Guatemala City is generally warm, almost springlike, throughout the course of the year. It occasionally gets hot during the dry season, but not as hot and humid as in the cities located at sea level. The hottest month is April. The rainy season extends from May to October, coinciding with the tropical storm and hurricane season in the western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, while the dry season extends from November to April. The city can at times be windy, which also leads to lower ambient temperatures.\n\nThe average annual temperature ranges from {{convert|22|to|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} during the day, and {{convert|12|to|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} at night.\n\nAverage morning [[relative humidity]]: 82%, evening relative humidity: 58%.

[[Volc\u00e1n de Agua|Agua]], [[Volc\u00e1n de Fuego|Fuego]], [[Pacaya]] and [[Acatenango]] comprise a line of 33 stratovolcanoes that stretches across the breadth of Guatemala, from the Salvadorian border to the Mexican border.\n\n===Earthquakes===\n{{See also|1917 Guatemala earthquake|1976 Guatemala earthquake}}\n\nLying on the [[Ring of Fire]], the Guatemalan highlands and the Valle de la Ermita are frequently shaken by large earthquakes.  The last large tremor to hit the Guatemala City region occurred in the 1976, on the [[Motagua Fault]], a left-lateral [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip]] fault that forms the boundary between the [[Caribbean Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]].  The [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976 event]] registered 7.5 on the [[moment magnitude scale]].  Smaller, less severe tremors are frequently felt in Guatemala City and environs.\n\n===Mudslides===\nTorrential downpours, similar to the more famous monsoons, occur frequently in the Valle de la Ermita during the rainy season, leading to flash floods that sometimes inundate the city.  Due to these heavy rainfalls, some of the slums perched on the steep edges of the canyons that criss-cross the Valle de la Ermita are washed away and buried under mudslides, as in October 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carlos |first=Juan |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20051007/news_1n7stan.html |title=Mudslide in Guatemala kills dozens &#124; The San Diego Union-Tribune |publisher=Signonsandiego.com |date=2005-10-07 |accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> Tropical waves, tropical storms and hurricanes sometimes strike the Guatemalan highlands, which also bring torrential rains to the Guatemala City region and trigger these deadly mudslides.\n\n===Piping pseudokarst===\n[[File:Guatemala city sinkhole 2007 composite view.jpg|center|thumb|700px|2007 Sinkhole]]\n[[File:Guatemala City 2010 sinkhole 1.jpg|thumb|The 2010 sinkhole in Zona 2]]\nIn February [[2007 Guatemala City sinkhole|2007, a very large, deep circular hole]] with vertical walls opened in northeastern Guatemala City ({{Coord|14|39|1.40|N|90|29|25|W}}), killing five people.

Cambridge University Press. p. 384. {{ISBN|978-0521048170}}</ref> [[Uniformitarianism]], [[incrementalism]], and [[reformism]] are similar concepts.\n\n==Geology and biology==\n{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}\n\nIn the natural sciences, gradualism is the [[theory]] which holds that profound change is the cumulative product of slow but continuous processes, often contrasted with [[catastrophism]].  The theory was proposed in 1795 by [[James Hutton]], a Scottish geologist, and was later incorporated into [[Charles Lyell]]'s theory of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].  Tenets from both theories were applied to [[biology]] and formed the basis of early [[evolution]]ary theory.\n\n[[Charles Darwin]] was influenced by Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'', which explained both uniformitarian methodology and theory. Using uniformitarianism, which states that one cannot make an appeal to any force or phenomenon which cannot presently be observed (see [[catastrophism]]), Darwin theorized that the evolutionary process must occur gradually, not in [[Saltation (biology)|saltations]], since saltations are not presently observed, and extreme deviations from the usual phenotypic variation would be more likely to be selected against.\n\nGradualism is often confused with the concept of [[phyletic gradualism]]. It is a term coined by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] to contrast with their model of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which is gradualist itself, but argues that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability (called stasis), which is punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution.<ref name=punc1972>Eldredge, Niles, and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.pdf \"Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism.\"] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman, Cooper and Company, pp. 82-115.</ref>\n\n=== Phyletic gradualism ===\n{{main|Phyletic gradualism}}\n[[Phyletic gradualism]] is a model of [[evolution]] which theorizes that most [[speciation]] is slow, uniform and gradual.<ref name=pe1972>Eldredge, N. and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.asp \"Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism\"] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. p. 84.</ref> When evolution occurs in this mode, it is usually by the steady transformation of a whole [[species]] into a new one (through a process called [[anagenesis]]). In this view no clear line of demarcation exists between an ancestral species and a descendant species, unless [[cladogenesis|splitting]] occurs.\n\n=== Punctuated gradualism ===\n{{main|Punctuated gradualism}}\n[[Punctuated gradualism]] is a [[microevolution]]ary [[hypothesis]] that refers to a species that has \"relative stasis over a considerable part of its total duration [and] underwent periodic, relatively rapid, morphologic change that did not lead to lineage branching\". It is one of the three common models of [[evolution]]. While the traditional model of palaeontology, the phylogenetic model, states that features evolved slowly without any direct association with speciation, the relatively newer and more controversial idea of [[punctuated equilibrium]] claims that major evolutionary changes don't happen over a gradual period but in localized, rare, rapid events of branching speciation.  Punctuated gradualism is considered to be a variation of these models, lying somewhere in between the [[phyletic gradualism]] model and the punctuated equilibrium model. It states that speciation is not needed for a lineage to rapidly evolve from one equilibrium to another but may show rapid transitions between long-stable states.\n\n== Politics and society ==\n{{Social democracy sidebar |Development}}\n\nIn [[politics]], gradualism is the hypothesis that social change can be achieved in small, discrete increments rather than in abrupt strokes such as [[revolution]]s or [[rebellion|uprisings]]. Gradualism is one of the defining features of political [[liberalism]] and [[reformism]].<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=903 | title=Left reformism, the state and the problem of socialist politics today | author=Paul Blackledge | year=2013 | work= | publisher=International Socialist Journal | accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref> [[Machiavellian]] politics pushes politicians to espouse gradualism.\n\nIn [[socialism|socialist politics]] and within the socialist movement, the concept of gradualism is frequently distinguished from reformism, with the former insisting that short-term goals need to be formulated and implemented in such a way that they inevitably lead into long-term goals. It is most commonly associated with the [[libertarian socialist]] concept of [[dual power]] and is seen as a middle way between reformism and [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionism]].\n\n[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was opposed to the idea of gradualism as a method of eliminating [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]]. The government wanted to try to integrate [[African-American]]s and European-Americans slowly into the same society, but many believed it was a way for the government to put off actually doing anything about racial segregation:\n\n{{quote|This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.

This view teaches that the lives and relationships of people with morally unacceptable lifestyles may have some elements of good, even of great good, such as [[Agape|sacrificial love]] and consistent respect. It holds that virtues are not all-or-nothing propositions, and that elements of good may be found even in the context of morally unacceptable situations. Catholic clergy who espouse this view include the Bishop of [[San Diego, California]], [[Robert W. McElroy]], who in 2016 wrote: {{quote|The principle of gradualness reaches far beyond the question of marriage to embrace all elements of the Christian moral life, for it really is an embodiment of the pastoral method of the Lord himself.

The opposite approach, that [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]] is attained all at once, is called [[subitism]]. The debate on the issue was very important to the history of the development of [[Zen]], which rejected gradualism,<ref>[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/ChanZenStudies.htm Bernard Faure, ''Chan/Zen Studies in English: The State Of The Field'']</ref> and to the establishment of the opposite approach within the [[Tibetan Buddhism]], after the [[Debate of Samye]].

In a more general way, [[reformism]] is the assumption that gradual changes through and within existing institutions can ultimately change a [[society]]'s fundamental [[economic system]] and political structures; and that an accumulation of reforms can lead to the emergence of an entirely different economic system and form of society than present-day [[capitalism]]. That hypothesis of social change grew out of opposition to [[revolutionary socialism]], which contends that [[revolution]] is necessary for fundamental structural changes to occur.\n\nIn the terminology of [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Gradualism|NWO]]-related speculations, gradualism refers to the gradual implementation of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Evolution]]\n* [[Uniformitarianism]]\n* [[Incrementalism]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Catastrophism]]\n* [[Saltation (biology)|Saltation]]\n* [[Punctuated equilibrium]]\n* [[Accelerationism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{reflist|group=web}}\n\n[[Category:Geology theories]]\n[[Category:Rate of evolution]]\n[[Category:Liberalism]]\n[[Category:Social democracy]]\n[[Category:Linguistics terminology]]\n[[Category:Social theories]]", "sha1": "slw3z0ox953apg4tuvx53yk6r0eypwf"}}, {"title": "Gravity (old version)", "ns": "0", "id": "11878", "redirect": {"title": "Gravity"}, "revision": {"id": "770814031", "parentid": "648599134", "timestamp": "2017-03-17T19:06:32Z", "contributor": {"username": "Rchard2scout", "id": "6917124"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Replace deprecated {{This is a redirect}} with {{Redirect category shell}}.

These probably took place during the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] of Northern Europe from c. 500 BC. [[Proto-Germanic]] itself was likely spoken after c. 500 BC,<ref>Ringe (2006), p. 67.</ref> and [[Proto-Norse]] from the 2nd century AD and later is still quite close to reconstructed Proto-Germanic, but other common innovations separating Germanic from [[Proto-Indo-European]] suggest a common history of pre-Proto-Germanic speakers throughout the [[Nordic Bronze Age]].\n\nFrom the time of their earliest attestation, the Germanic varieties are divided into three groups:  [[West Germanic languages|West]], [[East Germanic languages|East]], and [[North Germanic languages|North]] Germanic. Their exact relation is difficult to determine from the sparse evidence of runic inscriptions.\n\nThe western group would have formed in the late [[Jastorf culture]], and the eastern group may be derived from the 1st-century [[Old Gutnish|variety]] of [[Gotland]], leaving southern Sweden as the original location of the northern group. The earliest period of [[Elder Futhark]] (2nd to 4th centuries) predates the division in regional script variants, and linguistically essentially still reflect the [[Common Germanic]] stage. [[Vimose inscriptions]] AD 160, are the oldest Germanic writing.\n\nThe earliest coherent Germanic text preserved is the 4th-century [[Gothic language|Gothic]] translation of the [[New Testament]] by [[Ulfilas]]. Early testimonies of West Germanic are in [[Old Frankish]]/[[Old Dutch]] (the 5th-century [[Bergakker inscription]]), [[Old High German]] (scattered words and sentences 6th century and coherent texts 9th century), and [[Old English language|Old English]] (oldest texts 650, coherent texts 10th century). North Germanic is only attested in scattered runic inscriptions, as [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]], until it evolves into [[Old Norse]] by about 800.\n\nLonger runic inscriptions survive from the 8th and 9th centuries ([[Eggjum stone]], [[R\u00f6k stone]]), longer texts in the Latin alphabet survive from the 12th century ([[\u00cdslendingab\u00f3k]]), and some [[skaldic poetry]] dates back to as early as the 9th century.\n\nBy about the 10th century, the varieties had diverged enough to make [[mutual intelligibility|inter-comprehensibility]] difficult. The linguistic contact of the [[Viking]] settlers of the [[Danelaw]] with the [[Anglo-Saxons]] left traces in the English language and is suspected to have facilitated the collapse of Old English grammar that resulted in [[Middle English]] from the 12th century.\n\nThe East Germanic languages were marginalized from the end of the Migration period. The [[Burgundians]], [[Goths]], and [[Vandals]] became linguistically assimilated by their respective neighbors by about the 7th century, with only [[Crimean Gothic language|Crimean Gothic]] lingering on until the 18th century.\n\nDuring the early Middle Ages, the West Germanic languages were separated by the insular development of Middle English on one hand and by the [[High German consonant shift]] on the continent on the other, resulting in [[Upper German]] and [[Low German|Low Saxon]], with graded intermediate [[Central German]] varieties. By early modern times, the span had extended into considerable differences, ranging from [[Highest Alemannic German|Highest Alemannic]] in the South to [[Northern Low Saxon]] in the North, and, although both extremes are considered German, they are hardly mutually intelligible. The southernmost varieties had completed the second sound shift, while the northern varieties remained unaffected by the consonant shift.\n\nThe North Germanic languages, on the other hand, remained unified until well past 1000 AD, and in fact the mainland Scandinavian languages still largely retain mutual intelligibility into modern times.  The main split in these languages is between the mainland languages and the island languages to the west, especially [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which has maintained the grammar of [[Old Norse]] virtually unchanged, while the mainland languages have diverged greatly.\n\n==Characteristics==\nGermanic languages possess a number of defining features compared with other Indo-European languages.\n\nProbably the most well-known are the following:\n# The [[sound change]]s known as [[Grimm's Law]] and [[Verner's Law]], which shifted the values of all the Indo-European stop consonants (for example, original *{{IPA|/t d d\u02b0/}} became Germanic *{{IPA|/\u03b8 t d/}} in most cases; compare ''three'' with [[Latin]] {{lang|la|tres}}, ''two'' with Latin {{lang|la|duo}}, ''do'' with [[Sanskrit]] {{transl|sa|dha-}}). The recognition of these two sound laws were seminal events in the understanding of the regular nature of linguistic sound change and the development of the [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]], which forms the basis of modern [[historical linguistics]].\n# The development of a strong [[stress (language)|stress]] on the first syllable of the word, which triggered significant phonological reduction of all other syllables. This is responsible for the reduction of most of the basic English, Norwegian, Danish and Swedish words into monosyllables, and the common impression of modern English and German as consonant-heavy languages. Examples are Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*strangi\u00fe\u014d}} \u2192 ''strength'', {{lang|gem-x-proto|*aimaitij\u014d}} \u2192 ''ant'', {{lang|gem-x-proto|*haubudan}} \u2192 ''head'', {{lang|gem-x-proto|*hauzijanan}}  \u2192 ''hear'', {{lang|gem-x-proto|*harubistaz}} \u2192 German {{lang|de|Herbst}} \"autumn, harvest\", {{lang|gem-x-proto|*hagatusj\u014d}} \u2192 German {{lang|de|Hexe}} \"witch, hag\".\n# A change known as [[Germanic umlaut]], which modified vowel qualities when a high front vocalic segment ({{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} or {{IPA|/j/}}) followed in the next syllable.  Generally, back vowels were fronted, and front vowels were raised. In many languages, the modified vowels are indicated with a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (e.g., {{lang|de|\u00e4 \u00f6 \u00fc}} in German, pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b \u00f8 y/}}, respectively). This change resulted in pervasive alternations in related words \u2014 still extremely prominent in modern German but present only in remnants in modern English (e.g., ''mouse/mice'', ''goose/geese'', ''broad/breadth'', ''tell/told'', ''old/elder'', ''foul/filth'', ''gold/gild''<ref>These alternations are no longer easily distinguishable from vowel alternations due to earlier changes (e.g. [[Indo-European ablaut]], as in ''write/wrote/written'', ''sing/sang/sung'', ''hold/held'') or later changes (e.g. vowel shortening in [[Middle English]], as in ''wide/width'', ''lead/led'').</ref>).\n# Large numbers of vowel qualities.

Exactly one noun phrase or adverbial element must precede the verb; in particular, if an adverb or prepositional phrase precedes the verb, then the subject must immediately follow the finite verb. This is now largely absent in modern English, except in sentences beginning with \"Here is,\" \"There is,\" \"Here comes,\" \"There goes,\" and related expressions, as well as in a few relic sentences such as \"Over went the boat\" or \"[[Pop Goes The Weasel]]\", but is found in all other modern Germanic languages.\n\nOther significant characteristics are:\n# The reduction of the various [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] combinations of the Indo-European verbal system into only two: the [[present tense]] and the [[past tense]] (also called the [[preterite]]).\n# A large class of verbs that use a dental [[suffix]] ({{IPA|/d/}} or {{IPA|/t/}}) instead of [[Apophony|vowel alternation]] ([[Indo-European ablaut]]) to indicate past tense. These are called the [[Germanic weak verb]]s; the remaining verbs with vowel ablaut are the [[Germanic strong verb]]s.\n# A distinction in [[definiteness]] of a [[noun phrase]] that is marked by different sets of inflectional endings for [[adjectives]], the so-called strong and weak [[adjective]]s. A similar development happened in the [[Balto-Slavic languages]]. This distinction has been lost in modern English but was present in [[Old English]] and remains in all other Germanic languages to various degrees.\n# Some words with etymologies that are difficult to link to other Indo-European families but with variants that appear in almost all Germanic languages. See [[Germanic substrate hypothesis]].\n\nNote that some of the above characteristics were not present in Proto-Germanic but developed later as [[areal feature]]s that spread from language to language:\n* Germanic umlaut only affected the [[North Germanic languages|North]] and [[West Germanic languages]] (which represent all modern Germanic languages) but not the now-extinct [[East Germanic languages]], such as [[Gothic language|Gothic]], nor [[Proto-Germanic]], the common ancestor of all Germanic languages.\n* The large inventory of vowel qualities is a later development, due to a combination of Germanic umlaut and the tendency in many Germanic languages for pairs of long/short vowels of originally identical quality to develop distinct qualities, with the length distinction sometimes eventually lost. Proto-Germanic had only five distinct vowel qualities, although there were more actual vowel phonemes because length and possibly nasality were phonemic. In modern German, long-short vowel pairs still exist but are also distinct in quality.\n* Proto-Germanic probably had a more general S-O-V-I word order. However, the tendency toward V2 order may have already been present in latent form and may be related to [[Wackernagel's Law]], an Indo-European law dictating that sentence [[clitic]]s must be placed second.<ref>According to [[Donald Ringe]] (cf. Ringe (2006), p. 295)</ref>\n\nRoughly speaking, Germanic languages differ in how conservative or how progressive each language is with respect to an overall trend toward [[analytic language|analyticity]]. Some, such as [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and, to a lesser extent, German, have preserved much of the complex [[inflectional morphology]] inherited from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] (and in turn from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]). Others, such as English, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Afrikaans]], have moved toward a largely analytic type.\n\n==Linguistic developments==\n\nThe subgroupings of the Germanic languages are defined by shared innovations.  It is important to distinguish innovations from cases of linguistic conservatism.  That is, if two languages in a family share a characteristic that is not observed in a third language, that is evidence of common ancestry of the two languages ''only if'' the characteristic is an innovation compared to the family's [[proto-language]].\n\nThe following innovations are common to the [[Northwest Germanic]] languages (all but [[Gothic language|Gothic]]):\n* The lowering of /u/ to /o/ in initial syllables before /a/ in the following syllable (\"a-Umlaut\", traditionally called ''Brechung'')\n* \"Labial umlaut\" in unstressed medial syllables (the conversion of /a/ to /u/ and /\u014d/ to /\u016b/ before /m/, or /u/ in the following syllable)<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.ma/books/about/Old_English_grammar.html?id=-TNKAAAAYAAJ&redir_esc=y |title=Old English Grammar |last=Campbell |first=Alistair |date=1983-01-01 |publisher=Clarendon Press |year= |isbn=9780198119432 |location= |pages=139 |language=en |via=}}</ref>\n* The conversion of /\u0113<sub>1</sub>/ into /\u0101/ (vs. Gothic /\u0113/) in stressed syllables.<ref>But see [[Fausto Cercignani|Cercignani, Fausto]], ''Indo-European \u0113 in Germanic'', in \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr vergleichende Sprachforschung\", 86/1, 1972, pp. 104\u2013110.</ref> In unstressed syllables, West Germanic also has this change, but North Germanic has shortened the vowel to /e/, then raised it to /i/.

Old English ''-ian'' < ''-\u014djan'', but Old High German ''-\u014dn'').\n* Development of a plural ending '''*-\u014ds''' in a-stem nouns (note, Gothic also has ''-\u014ds'', but this is an independent development, caused by [[terminal devoicing]] of ''*-\u014dz''; [[Old Frisian]] has ''-ar'', which is thought to be a late borrowing from [[Danish language|Danish]]).  Cf. modern English plural ''-(e)s'', but German plural ''-e''.\n* Possibly, the [[monophthong]]ization of Germanic ''*ai'' to ''\u0113/\u0101'' (this may represent independent changes in Old Saxon and [[Anglo-Frisian]]).\n\nThe following innovations are common to the [[Anglo-Frisian]] subgroup of the [[Ingvaeonic languages]]:\n* Raising of nasalized ''a, \u0101'' into ''o, \u014d''.\n* [[Anglo-Frisian brightening]]: Fronting of non-nasal ''a, \u0101'' to ''\u00e6,\u01e3'' when not followed by ''n'' or ''m''.\n* [[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]] of ''CrV'' into ''CVr'', where ''C'' represents any consonant and ''V'' any vowel.\n* [[Monophthongization]] of ''ai'' into ''\u0101''.\n\n==Common linguistic features==\n===Phonology===\nThe oldest Germanic languages all share a number of features, which are assumed to be inherited from [[Proto-Germanic]]. Phonologically, it includes the important sound changes known as [[Grimm's Law]] and [[Verner's Law]], which introduced a large number of [[fricative]]s; late [[Proto-Indo-European]] had only one, /s/.\n\nThe main vowel developments are the merging (in most circumstances) of long and short /a/ and /o/, producing short /a/ and long /\u014d/. That likewise affected the [[diphthong]]s, with PIE /ai/ and /oi/ merging into /ai/ and PIE /au/ and /ou/ merging into /au/. PIE /ei/ developed into long /\u012b/. PIE long /\u0113/ developed into a vowel denoted as /\u0113<sub>1</sub>/ (often assumed to be phonetically {{IPA|[\u01e3]}}), while a new, fairly uncommon long vowel /\u0113<sub>2</sub>/ developed in varied and not completely understood circumstances. Proto-Germanic had no [[front rounded vowel]]s, but all Germanic languages except for [[Gothic language|Gothic]] subsequently developed them through the process of [[i-umlaut]].\n\nProto-Germanic developed a strong stress accent on the first syllable of the root, but remnants of the original free PIE accent are visible due to Verner's Law, which was sensitive to this accent. That caused a steady erosion of vowels in unstressed syllables. In Proto-Germanic, that had progressed only to the point that absolutely-final short vowels (other than /i/ and /u/) were lost and absolutely-final long vowels were shortened, but all of the early literary languages show a more advanced state of vowel loss. This ultimately resulted in some languages (like Modern English) losing practically all vowels following the main stress and the consequent rise of a very large number of monosyllabic words.\n\n====Table of outcomes====\nThe following table shows the main outcomes of Proto-Germanic vowels and consonants in the various older languages. For vowels, only the outcomes in stressed syllables are shown. Outcomes in unstressed syllables are quite different, vary from language to language and depend on a number of other factors (such as whether the syllable was medial or final, whether the syllable was [[open syllable|open]] or [[closed syllable|closed]] and (in some cases) whether the preceding syllable was [[light syllable|light]] or [[heavy syllable|heavy]]).\n\nNotes:\n* ''C-'' means before a vowel (word-initially, or sometimes after a consonant).\n* ''-C-'' means between vowels.\n* ''-C'' means after a vowel (word-finally or before a consonant). Word-final outcomes generally occurred ''after'' deletion of final short vowels, which occurred shortly after Proto-Germanic and is reflected in the history of all written languages except for [[Proto-Norse]].\n* The above three are given in the order ''C-'', ''-C-'', ''-C''. If one is omitted, the previous one applies. For example, ''f, -[v]-'' means that ''[v]'' occurs after a vowel regardless of what follows.\n* Something like ''a(\u2026u)'' means \"''a'' if /u/ occurs in the next syllable\".\n* Something like ''a(n)'' means \"''a'' if /n/ immediately follows\".\n* Something like ''(n)a'' means \"''a'' if /n/ immediately precedes\".\n\n<!--\nThe original sorted list, in case we convert to Harvcol or some similar style with references listed at the bottom:\n\n<ref name=\"bennett1980\">{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=William H. |year=1980 |title=An introduction to the Gothic language |location=New York |publisher=Modern Language Association of America}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"campbell1959\">{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=A. |year=1959 |title=Old English grammar |location=London |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"diamond1970\">{{cite book |last=Diamond |first=Robert E. |year=1970 |title=Old English grammar and reader |location=Detroit |publisher=Wayne State University Press}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"gordon1927\">{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=E.V. |year=1927 |title=An introduction to Old Norse |location=London |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"hall1984\">{{cite book |last=Hall |first=J.R. |year=1984 |title=A concise Anglo\u2013Saxon dictionary, 4th edition |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"helfenstein1870\">{{cite book |last=Helfenstein |first=James |year=1870 |title=A comparative grammar of the Teutonic languages |location=London |publisher=MacMillan and Co}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"k\u00f6nig1994\">{{cite book |last1=K\u00f6nig |first1=Ekkehard |last2=van der Auwera |first2=Johan |year=1994 |title=The Germanic languages |location=London |publisher=Routledge}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"lass1975\">{{cite book |last1=Lass |first1=Roger |last2=Anderson |first2=John M. |year=1975 |title=Old English phonology |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"lass1994\">{{cite book |last=Lass |first=Roger |year=1994 |title=Old English: A historical linguistic companion |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"mitchell1992\">{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Bruce |last2=Robinson |first2=Fred C. |year=1992 |title=A guide to Old English, 5th edition |location=Cambridge |publisher=Blackwell}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ringe2009\">{{cite book |last=Ringe |first=Don |year=2009 |title=A linguistic history of English: From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"robinson1992\">{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Orrin |year=1992 |title=Old English and its closest relatives |location=Stanford |publisher=Stanford University Press}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"waterman1976\">{{cite book |last=Waterman |first=John C. |year=1976 |title=A history of the German language |location=Prospect Heights, Illinois |publisher=Waveland Press}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"wright1/ref> standard German and Dutch 14, and [[Danish language|Danish]] at least 11.906\">{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Joseph |year=1906 |title=An Old High German primer, 2nd edition |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"wright1919\">{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Joseph C. |year=1919 |title=Grammar of the Gothic language |location=London |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"wright1925\">{{cite book |last1=Wright |first1=Joseph |last2=Wright |first2=Mary Elizabeth |year=1925 |title=Old English grammar, 3rd edition |location=London |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\nThis reference from above is not included below:\n\n<ref name=\"hall1984\"/>\n-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Development of Germanic sounds\n!

Likewise, it is generally agreed that the outcomes of cases 3 and 4 were pronounced {{IPA|[\u025b]}} and {{IPA|[\u0254]}} in Gothic.  However, there is some argument over whether the outcomes of case 1 were still pronounced as diphthongs {{IPA|[ai/au]}}, as in Proto-Germanic, or had merged with case 2 as monophthongs {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0/\u0254\u02d0]}}. There is some historical evidence (particularly from Latin spelling variations of ''Gaut-'' vs. ''G\u014dt-'', used to represent the name of the Goths) that the Proto-Germanic diphthongs had changed into monophthongs shortly before (i.e., within a century of) the time of [[Wulfila]], who designed the Gothic alphabet and wrote the [[Gothic Bible]] c. 360 AD. This accords with the fact that Wulfila used the same symbols {{angbr|ai/au}} to represent all the outcomes, despite the fact that the spellings {{angbr|aj/aw}} were available to unambiguously represent diphthongs (and, in fact, alternate with {{angbr|ai/au}} in a number of nominal and verbal paradigms). The use of the spelling {{angbr|ai}} to represent a monophthong {{IPA|[\u025b(\u02d0)]}} was evidently in imitation of 4th century Greek, where {{angbr|ai}} likewise stood for {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}}, and {{angbr|au}} was apparently created by analogy. Consistent with many sources (e.g., Bennett (1980)), the phonology described here is that of \"Pre-Gothic\" (i.e., the phonology of Gothic just before the monophthongization of /ai/ and /au/).</ref><ref name=\"bennett1980\"/><ref name=\"wright1919\"/> !!

Some vowels were affected similarly, but only by a following /w/; this process is sometimes termed ''w-umlaut''. These processes operated after [[i-umlaut]].  ''U-umlaut'' (by a following /u/ or /w/) caused /a/, /ja/ (broken /e/), /a\u02d0/, and /e/ to round to /\u0254/ (written ''o\u0327''), /j\u0254/ (written ''jo\u0327''), /\u0254\u02d0/ (written ''\u00f3\u0327'' and later unrounded again to /a\u02d0/), and /\u00f8/, respectively.  The vowels /i/ and /ai/ rounded to /y/ and /ey/, respectively, only before /w/.  Short /a/ become /\u00f8/ by a combination of i-umlaut and w-umlaut.</ref> || \u00e6, a(\u2026a),<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"a-umlaut\">A process known as [[a-mutation]] or ''a-umlaut'' caused short /u/ to lower to /o/ before a non-high vowel (usually /a/) in the following syllable.  All languages except Gothic were affected, although there are various exceptions in all the languages.  Two similar process later operated:\n* In Old High German, /iu/ (from Proto-Germanic /eu/,/iu/) became /io/ before a non-high vowel in the next syllable.\n* In Old English, /\u00e6/ (from Proto-Germanic /a/) became /a/ before /a/ in the next syllable.\nAll of these processes were blocked in an i-umlaut context (i.e. by a following /j/).</ref> a/o(n), \u00e6\u0306\u0103(h,rC,lC)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"oe-breaking\">The diphthongal results are due to [[Old English breaking]].  In general, front vowels break into diphthongs before some subset of ''h'', ''w'', ''rC'', and ''lC'', where ''C'' is a consonant.  The diphthong /\u00e6a/ is written ''ea''; /eo/ is written ''eo''; /iu/ is written ''io''; and /iy/ is written ''ie''. All diphthongs umlaut to /iy/ ''ie''. All diphthongs occur both long and short. Note that there is significant dispute about the actual pronunciation of ''io'' and (especially) ''ie''. Their interpretation as /iu/ and /iy/, respectively, follows Lass (1994), ''Old English: A historical linguistic companion''.</ref> || a\n|-\n! a(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\">All languages except Gothic were affected by [[i-umlaut]].  This was the most significant of the various [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] processes operating in the Germanic languages, and caused back vowels to become fronted, and front vowels to be raised, when /i/, /i\u02d0/ or /j/ followed in the next syllable.  The term ''i-umlaut'' actually refers to two separate processes that both were triggered in the same environment.  The earlier process raised /e/ and /eu/ to /i/ and /iu/, respectively, and may have operated still in Proto-Germanic (with its effects in Gothic obscured due to later changes).  The later process affected all back vowels and some front vowels; it operated independently in the various languages, occurring at differing times with differing results.  Old English was the earliest and most-affected language, with nearly all vowels affected.  Old High German was the last language to be affected; the only written evidence of the process is with short /a/, which is umlauted to /e/.  However, later evidence suggests that other back vowels were also affected, perhaps still sub-phonemically in Old High German times.  These are indicated with a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] or \"umlaut\" symbol (two dots) placed over the affected vowels.</ref>\n| e, \u00f8(\u2026u)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-u-umlaut\" /> || e, \u00e6, \u012dy\u0306(h,rC,lC)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"oe-breaking\" /> || e, a(hs,ht,Cw)\n|-\n! \u00e3\u02d0\n| rowspan=2 | a\u02d0  || a\u02d0 || o\u02d0 || a\u02d0\n|-\n! \u00e3\u02d0(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\" />\n| \u00e6\u02d0 || e\u02d0 || \u00e4\u02d0\n|-\n! \u00e6\u02d0\n| rowspan=2 | e\u02d0, \u025b\u02d0(V) || a\u02d0 || \u00e6\u02d0, \u00e6a(h)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"oe-breaking\" /> || a\u02d0\n|-\n! \u00e6\u02d0(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\" />\n| \u00e6\u02d0 || \u00e6\u02d0 || \u00e4\u02d0\n|-\n! e\n| rowspan=2 | i, \u025b(h,h\u02b7,r) || ja,<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-breaking\">Proto-Germanic /e/ usually became Old Norse /ja/ by a process known as [[vowel breaking]].</ref> j\u00f8(\u2026u),<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-u-umlaut\" /> (w,r,l)e, (w,r,l)\u00f8(\u2026u)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-u-umlaut\" /> || e, \u0115\u014f(h,w,rC)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"oe-breaking\" /> || e, i(\u2026u)\n|-\n! e(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\" />\n| i, y(\u2026w)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-u-umlaut\" /> || i || i\n|-\n! e\u02d0\n| e\u02d0, \u025b\u02d0(V) || e\u02d0 || e\u02d0 || {{not a typo|ie}}\n|-\n! i\n| i, \u025b(h,h\u02b7,r) || i, y(\u2026w)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-u-umlaut\" /> || i, \u012d\u016d(h,w,rC)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"oe-breaking\" /> || i\n|-\n! i\u02d0\n| i\u02d0 || i\u02d0 || i\u02d0, iu(h) || i\u02d0\n|-\n! o\u02d0\n| rowspan=2 | o\u02d0, \u0254\u02d0(V) || o\u02d0 || o\u02d0 || uo\n|-\n! o\u02d0(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\" />\n| \u00f8\u02d0 || e\u02d0 || \u00fc\u00f6\n|-\n! u\n| rowspan=2 | u, \u0254(h,h\u02b7,r) || u, o(\u2026a)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"a-umlaut\" /> || u, o(\u2026a)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"a-umlaut\" /> || u, o(\u2026a)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"a-umlaut\" />\n|-\n! u(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\" />\n| y || y || \u00fc\n|-\n! u\u02d0\n| rowspan=2 | u\u02d0, \u0254\u02d0(V) || u\u02d0 || u\u02d0 || u\u02d0\n|-\n! u\u02d0(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\" />\n| y\u02d0 || y\u02d0 || \u00fc\u02d0\n|-\n! ai\n| rowspan=2 | ai<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"pre-gothic\" /> || ei, ey(\u2026w),<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-u-umlaut\" /> a\u02d0(h,r)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-ai\">Before Proto-Germanic /x/, /x\u02b7/ or /r/, but not before Proto-Germanic /z/ (which only merged with /r/ much later in North Germanic).

The old Germanic languages are famous for having only two tenses (present and past), with three PIE past-tense aspects (imperfect, aorist, and perfect/stative) merged into one and no new tenses (future, pluperfect, etc.) developing.  There were three moods: indicative, subjunctive (developed from the PIE [[optative mood]]) and imperative.  Gothic verbs had a number of archaic features inherited from PIE that were lost in the other Germanic languages with few traces, including dual endings, an inflected passive voice (derived from the PIE [[mediopassive voice]]), and a class of verbs with reduplication in the past tense (derived from the PIE perfect).  The complex tense system of modern English (e.g. ''In three months, the house will still be being built'' or ''If you had not acted so stupidly, we would never have been caught'') is almost entirely due to subsequent developments (although paralleled in many of the other Germanic languages).\n\nAmong the primary innovations in Proto-Germanic are the [[preterite present verb]]s, a special set of verbs whose present tense looks like the past tense of other verbs and which is the origin of most [[modal verb]]s in English; a past-tense ending (in the so-called \"weak verbs\", marked with ''-ed'' in English) that appears variously as /d/ or /t/, often assumed to be derived from the verb \"to do\"; and two separate sets of adjective endings, originally corresponding to a distinction between indefinite semantics (\"a man\", with a combination of PIE adjective and pronoun endings) and definite semantics (\"the man\", with endings derived from PIE ''n''-stem nouns).\n\nNote that most modern Germanic languages have lost most of the inherited inflectional morphology as a result of the steady attrition of unstressed endings triggered by the strong initial stress. (Contrast, for example, the [[Balto-Slavic languages]], which have largely kept the Indo-European [[pitch accent]] and consequently preserved much of the inherited morphology.) [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and to a lesser extent modern German best preserve the Proto\u2013Germanic inflectional system, with four noun cases, three genders, and well-marked verbs. English and Afrikaans are at the other extreme, with almost no remaining inflectional morphology.\n\nThe following shows a typical masculine ''a''-stem noun, Proto-Germanic ''*fiskaz'' (\"fish\"), and its development in the various old literary languages:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Declension of ''a''-stem noun ''*fiskaz'' \"fish\" in various languages<ref>Ringe (2006), Lass (1994), Helfenstein (1870).</ref>\n! colspan=2 | !!

The most common class (the ''o/\u0101'' class) used a combination of ''o''-stem endings for masculine and neuter genders and ''\u0101''-stems ending for feminine genders, but other common classes (e.g. the ''i'' class and ''u'' class) used endings from a single vowel-stem declension for all genders, and various other classes existed that were based on other declensions. A quite different set of \"pronominal\" endings was used for pronouns, [[determiner (linguistics)|determiners]], and words with related semantics (e.g., \"all\", \"only\").\n\nAn important innovation in Proto-Germanic was the development of two separate sets of adjective endings, originally corresponding to a distinction between indefinite semantics (\"a man\") and definite semantics (\"the man\"). The endings of indefinite adjectives were derived from a combination of pronominal endings with one of the common vowel-stem adjective declensions \u2013 usually the ''o/\u0101'' class (often termed the ''a/\u014d'' class in the specific context of the Germanic languages) but sometimes the ''i'' or ''u'' classes. Definite adjectives, however, had endings based on ''n''-stem nouns.  Originally both types of adjectives could be used by themselves, but already by Proto-Germanic times a pattern evolved whereby definite adjectives had to be accompanied by a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] with definite semantics (e.g., a [[definite article]], [[demonstrative pronoun]], [[possessive pronoun]], or the like), while indefinite adjectives were used in other circumstances (either accompanied by a word with indefinite semantics such as \"a\", \"one\", or \"some\" or unaccompanied).\n\nIn the 19th century, the two types of adjectives \u2013 indefinite and definite \u2013 were respectively termed \"strong\" and \"weak\", names which are still commonly used. These names were based on the appearance of the two sets of endings in modern German. In German, the distinctive case endings formerly present on nouns have largely disappeared, with the result that the load of distinguishing one case from another is almost entirely carried by determiners and adjectives. Furthermore, due to regular sound change, the various definite (''n''-stem) adjective endings coalesced to the point where only two endings (''-e'' and ''-en'') remain in modern German to express the sixteen possible inflectional categories of the language (masculine/feminine/neuter/plural crossed with nominative/accusative/dative/genitive \u2013 modern German merges all genders in the plural). The indefinite (''a/\u014d''-stem) adjective endings were less affected by sound change, with six endings remaining (''-, -e, -es, -er, -em, -en''), cleverly distributed in a way that is capable of expressing the various inflectional categories without too much ambiguity. As a result, the definite endings were thought of as too \"weak\" to carry inflectional meaning and in need of \"strengthening\" by the presence of an accompanying determiner, while the indefinite endings were viewed as \"strong\" enough to indicate the inflectional categories even when standing alone. (This view is enhanced by the fact that modern German largely uses weak-ending adjectives when accompanying an indefinite article, and hence the indefinite/definite distinction no longer clearly applies.) By analogy, the terms \"strong\" and \"weak\" were extended to the corresponding noun classes, with ''a''-stem and ''\u014d''-stem nouns termed \"strong\" and ''n''-stem nouns termed \"weak\".\n\nHowever, in Proto-Germanic \u2013 and still in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], the most conservative Germanic language \u2013 the terms \"strong\" and \"weak\" are not clearly appropriate. For one thing, there were a large number of noun declensions. The ''a''-stem, ''\u014d''-stem, and ''n''-stem declensions were the most common and represented targets into which the other declensions were eventually absorbed, but this process occurred only gradually. Originally the ''n''-stem declension was not a single declension but a set of separate declensions (e.g., ''-an'', ''-\u014dn'', ''-\u012bn'') with related endings, and these endings were in no way any \"weaker\" than the endings of any other declensions. (For example, among the eight possible inflectional categories of a noun \u2014 singular/plural crossed with nominative/accusative/dative/genitive \u2014 masculine ''an''-stem nouns in Gothic include seven endings, and feminine ''\u014dn''-stem nouns include six endings, meaning there is very little ambiguity of \"weakness\" in these endings and in fact much less than in the German \"strong\" endings.) Although it is possible to group the various noun declensions into three basic categories \u2014 vowel-stem, ''n''-stem, and other-consonant-stem (a.k.a. \"minor declensions\") \u2014 the vowel-stem nouns do not display any sort of unity in their endings that supports grouping them together with each other but separate from the ''n''-stem endings.\n\nIt is only in later languages that the binary distinction between \"strong\" and \"weak\" nouns become more relevant. In [[Old English]], the ''n''-stem nouns form a single, clear class, but the masculine ''a''-stem and feminine ''\u014d''-stem nouns have little in common with each other, and neither has much similarity to the small class of ''u''-stem nouns. Similarly, in [[Old Norse]], the masculine ''a''-stem and feminine ''\u014d''-stem nouns have little in common with each other, and the continuations of the masculine ''an''-stem and feminine ''\u014dn/\u012bn''-stem nouns are also quite distinct. It is only in [[Middle Dutch]] and modern German that the various vowel-stem nouns have merged to the point that a binary strong/weak distinction clearly applies.\n\nAs a result, newer grammatical descriptions of the Germanic languages often avoid the terms \"strong\" and \"weak\" except in conjunction with German itself, preferring instead to use the terms \"indefinite\" and \"definite\" for adjectives and to distinguish nouns by their actual stem class.\n\nIn English, both two sets of adjective endings were lost entirely in the late [[Middle English]] period.\n\n==Classification==<!-- This section is linked from [[American and British English differences]] -->\nNote that divisions between and among subfamilies of Germanic are rarely precisely defined; most form continuous clines, with adjacent [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] being mutually intelligible and more separated ones not.  Within the Germanic language family is [[East Germanic]], [[West Germanic]], and [[North Germanic]].  However, East Germanic languages became extinct several centuries ago.

The [[Gothic language]] was written in the [[Gothic alphabet]] developed by Bishop [[Ulfilas]] for his translation of the [[Bible]] in the 4th century.<ref>[[Fausto Cercignani|Cercignani, Fausto]], ''The Elaboration of the Gothic Alphabet and Orthography'', in \"Indogermanische Forschungen\", 93, 1988, pp. 168\u2013185.</ref> Later, [[Christianity|Christian]] priests and monks who spoke and read [[Latin]] in addition to their native Germanic varieties began writing the Germanic languages with slightly modified Latin letters.

The first of these branches survives in modern [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], all of which are descended from [[Old Norse]]. The East Germanic languages are now extinct, and the only historical member of this branch from which written texts survive is [[Gothic language|Gothic]]. The West Germanic languages, however, have undergone extensive dialectal subdivision and are now represented in modern languages such as [[English language|English]], German, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Yiddish]], [[Afrikaans]], and others.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22811452|title=Old English and its closest relatives : a survey of the earliest Germanic languages|last=Robinson|first=Orrin W.|date=1992|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-8047-2221-6|location=Stanford, Calif.|pages=16|oclc=22811452}}</ref>\n[[File:Germanic Languages Map Europe.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Germanic languages]] in Europe]]\nWithin the West Germanic language dialect continuum, the [[Benrath line|Benrath]] and [[Uerdingen line|Uerdingen]] lines (running through [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]-[[D\u00fcsseldorf-Benrath|Benrath]] and [[Krefeld]]-[[Uerdingen]], respectively) serve to distinguish the Germanic dialects that were affected by the [[High German consonant shift]] (south of Benrath) from those that were not (north of Uerdingen). The various regional dialects spoken south of these lines are grouped as [[High German languages|High German]] dialects ''(nos. 29\u201334 on the map)'', while those spoken to the north comprise the [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] ''(nos. 19\u201324)'' and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] ''(no. 25)'' dialects. As members of the West Germanic language family, High German, Low German, and Low Franconian can be further distinguished historically as [[Irminones|Irminonic]], [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]], and [[Istvaeones|Istvaeonic]], respectively. This classification indicates their historical descent from dialects spoken by the Irminones (also known as the Elbe group), Ingvaeones (or North Sea Germanic group), and Istvaeones (or Weser-Rhine group).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Standard German]] is based on [[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]]-[[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]] dialects ''(no. 30 on the map)'', which are [[Central German]] dialects ''(nos. 29\u201331)'', belonging to the Irminonic [[High German languages|High German]] dialect group ''(nos. 29\u201334)''. German is therefore most closely related to the other languages based on High German dialects, such as [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] (based on [[Central Franconian dialects]] \u2013 ''no. 29''), and [[Yiddish]]. Also closely related to Standard German are the [[Upper German]] dialects spoken in the southern [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking countries]], such as [[Swiss German]] ([[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] \u2013 ''no. 34''), and the various Germanic dialects spoken in the [[France|French]] [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Grand Est]], such as [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] (mainly Alemannic, but also Central- and&nbsp;[[High Franconian German|Upper Franconian]]&nbsp;''(no. 32)''&nbsp;dialects) and [[Lorraine Franconian]] (Central Franconian \u2013 ''no. 29'').\n\nAfter these High German dialects, standard German is (somewhat less closely) related to languages based on Low Franconian dialects (e.g. Dutch and Afrikaans) or Low German/Low Saxon dialects (spoken in northern [[Germany]] and southern [[Denmark]]), neither of which underwent the High German consonant shift. As has been noted, the former of these dialect types is Istvaeonic and the latter Ingvaeonic, whereas the High German dialects are all Irminonic; the differences between these languages and standard German are therefore considerable. Also related to German are the Frisian languages\u2014[[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] (spoken in [[Nordfriesland (district)|Nordfriesland]] \u2013 ''no. 28''), [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]] (spoken in [[Saterland]] \u2013 ''no. 27''), and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] (spoken in [[Friesland]] \u2013 ''no. 26'')\u2014as well as the Anglic languages of [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]]. These [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] dialects are all members of the Ingvaeonic family of West Germanic languages which did not take part in the High German consonant shift.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of German}}\n\n=== Old High German ===\n{{Main|Old High German}}\n\nThe [[History of German|history of the German language]] begins with the [[High German consonant shift]] during the [[migration period]], which separated [[Old High German]] (OHG) dialects from [[Old Saxon]]. This [[Sound change|sound shift]] involved a drastic change in the pronunciation of both [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and voiceless [[stop consonant]]s (''b'', ''d'', ''g'', and ''p'', ''t'', ''k'', respectively). The primary effects of the shift were the following:\n\n*Voiceless stops became long ([[Gemination|geminated]]) voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] following a vowel\n*Voiceless stops became [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] in word-initial position, or following certain consonants\n*Voiced stops became voiceless in certain phonetic settings.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22811452|title=Old English and its closest relatives : a survey of the earliest Germanic languages|last=Robinson|first=Orrin W.|date=1992|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-8047-2221-6|location=Stanford, Calif.|pages=239, 242|oclc=22811452}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Voiceless stop<br>following a vowel\n!Word-initial<br>voiceless stop\n!Voiced stop\n|-\n|/p/\u2192/ff/\n|/p/\u2192/pf/\n|/b/\u2192/p/\n|-\n|/t/\u2192/ss/\n|/t/\u2192/ts/\n|/d/\u2192/t/\n|-\n|/k/\u2192/xx/\n|/k/\u2192/kx/\n|/g/\u2192/k/\n|}\nWhile there is written evidence of the [[Old High German]] language in several [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions from as early as the 6th century AD (such as the [[Pforzen buckle]]), the Old High German period is generally seen as beginning with the ''[[Abrogans]]'' (written c.765\u2013775), a Latin-German [[glossary]] supplying over 3,000 OHG words with their [[Latin]] equivalents. Following the ''Abrogans'' the first coherent works written in OHG appear in the 9th century, chief among them being the ''[[Muspilli]]'', the ''[[Merseburg Charms]]'', and the ''[[Hildebrandslied]]'', as well as a number of other religious texts (the ''[[Georgslied]]'', the ''[[Ludwigslied]]'', the ''Evangelienbuch'', and translated hymns and prayers).<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\"Calvin2\">{{cite book|title=An Anthology of German Literature|publisher=D. C. Heath & co|pages=5\u20136|oclc=6128632|author=Calvin, Thomas}}</ref> The ''Muspilli'' is a Christian poem written in a [[Bavarian dialects|Bavarian]] dialect offering an account of the soul after the [[Last Judgment]], and the ''Merseburg Charms'' are transcriptions of spells and charms from the [[Paganism|pagan]] Germanic tradition. Of particular interest to scholars, however, has been the ''Hildebrandslied'', a secular [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] telling the tale of an estranged father and son unknowingly meeting each other in battle. Linguistically this text is highly interesting due to the mixed use of [[Old Saxon]] and Old High German dialects in its composition. The written works of this period stem mainly from the [[Alemanni|Alamanni]], [[Bavarian dialects|Bavarian]], and [[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]] groups, all belonging to the Elbe Germanic group ([[Irminones]]), which had settled in what is now southern-central [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] between the 2nd and 6th centuries during the great migration.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn general, the surviving texts of OHG show a wide range of [[dialect]]al diversity with very little written uniformity. The early written tradition of OHG survived mostly through [[Monastery|monasteries]] and [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] as local translations of Latin originals; as a result, the surviving texts are written in highly disparate regional dialects and exhibit significant Latin influence, particularly in vocabulary.<ref name=\":02\" /> At this point monasteries, where most written works were produced, were dominated by Latin, and German saw only occasional use in official and ecclesiastical writing.\n\nThe German language through the OHG period was still predominantly a spoken language, with a wide range of dialects and a much more extensive [[Oral literature|oral]] tradition than a written one. Having just emerged from the High German consonant shift, OHG was also a relatively new and volatile language still undergoing a number of [[Phonetics|phonetic]], [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], and [[Syntax|syntactic]] changes.

Significantly, among this repertoire are a number of impressive secular works, such as the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] telling the story of the [[dragon]]-slayer [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] (c. 13th century), and the ''[[Iwein]],'' an [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] verse poem by [[Hartmann von Aue]] (c. 1203), as well as several [[Lyric poetry|lyric poems]] and courtly romances such as ''[[Parzival]]'' and ''[[Tristan]]''. (Also noteworthy is the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'', the first book of laws written in [[Middle Low German|Middle ''Low'' German]] (c. 1220)). The abundance and especially the secular character of the literature of the MHG period demonstrate the beginnings of a standardized written form of German, as well as the desire of poets and authors to be understood by individuals on supra-dialectal terms.\n\nThe Middle High German period is generally seen as ending with the decimation of the population of [[Europe]] in the [[Black Death]] of 1346\u20131353.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Early New High German ===\n{{Main|Early New High German}}\n[[File:Deutsch-Niederl\u00e4ndischer Sprachraum (nach Werner K\u00f6nig).png|thumb|upright=1.36|left|German-Dutch language area before and after the [[flight and expulsion of Germans (1944-1950)]] from much of eastern and central Europe.

As a spoken language German remained highly fractured through this period with a vast number of often mutually-incomprehensible [[German dialects|regional dialects]] being spoken throughout the German states; the invention of the [[printing press]] c.1440 and the publication of [[Luther Bible|Luther's vernacular translation of the Bible]] in 1534, however, had an immense effect on standardizing German as a supra-dialectal written language.\n\nThe ENHG period saw the rise of several important cross-regional forms of [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] German, one being ''gemeine tiutsch,'' used in the court of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], and the other being ''Mei\u00dfner Deutsch'', used in the [[Electorate of Saxony]] in the [[Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4139504|title=The German language|last=Keller|first=R.E.|date=1978|publisher=Faber|year=|isbn=0-571-11159-9|location=London|pages=365\u2013368|oclc=4139504}}</ref> Alongside these courtly written standards, the invention of the printing press led to the development of a number of printers' languages (''Druckersprachen'') aimed at making printed material readable and understandable across as many diverse dialects of German as possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Geschichte der deutschen Sprache|last=Bach|first=Adolf|publisher=Quelle & Meyer|year=1965|isbn=|location=Heidelberg|pages=254}}</ref> The greater ease of production and increased availability of written texts brought about increased standardization in the written form of the German language.[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|The widespread popularity of the [[Luther Bible|Bible]] translated into German by [[Martin Luther]] helped establish modern German]]One of the central events in the development of ENHG was the publication of Luther's translation of the Bible into German (the [[New Testament]] in 1522 and the [[Old Testament]], published in parts and completed in 1534).

Copies of Luther's Bible featured a long list of [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]] for each region that translated words which were unknown in the region into the regional dialect. Concerning his translation method Luther says the following:<blockquote>One who would talk German does not ask the Latin how he shall do it; he must ask the mother in the home, the children on the streets, the common man in the market-place and note carefully how they talk, then translate accordingly. They will then understand what is said to them because it is German.

However, there are places where the traditional regional dialects have been replaced by new vernaculars based on standard German; that is the case in large stretches of [[Northern Germany]] but also in major cities in other parts of the country. It is important to note, however, that the colloquial standard German differs greatly from the formal written language, especially in grammar and syntax, in which it has been influenced by dialectal speech.\n\nStandard German differs regionally between German-speaking countries in [[vocabulary]] and some instances of [[pronunciation]] and even [[grammar]] and [[orthography]]. This variation must not be confused with the variation of local [[dialects]]. Even though the regional varieties of standard German are only somewhat influenced by the local dialects, they are very distinct. German is thus considered a [[pluricentric language]].\n\nIn most regions, the speakers use a continuum from more dialectal varieties to more standard varieties according to circumstances.\n\n=== Varieties of Standard German ===\n[[File:Standard varieties of German.png|thumb|The national and regional standard varieties of German.<ref>Ulrich Ammon, Hans Bickel, Jakob Ebner, et al.: {{lang|de|Variantenw\u00f6rterbuch des Deutschen.

They differ only slightly in lexicon and phonology. In certain regions, they have replaced the traditional German dialects, especially in Northern Germany.\n*[[German Standard German]]\n*[[Austrian Standard German]]\n*[[Swiss Standard German]]\n\nIn the German-speaking parts of [[Switzerland]], mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used, and the use of Standard German is largely restricted to the written language, though about 10% of the Swiss residents speak ''High German'' (aka Standard German) at home, but mainly due to German immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/05/blank/key/sprachen.html |type=official site |title=Sprachen, Religionen \u2013 Daten, Indikatoren: Sprachen \u2013 \u00dcblicherweise zu Hause gesprochene Sprachen |date=2015 |publisher=Swiss Federal Statistical Office |location=Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland |language=German, French, Italian |quote=Zu Hause oder mit den Angeh\u00f6rigen sprechen 60,1% der betrachteten Bev\u00f6lkerung haupts\u00e4chlich Schweizerdeutsch, 23,4% Franz\u00f6sisch, 8,4% Italienisch, 10,1% Hochdeutsch und 4,6% Englisch |accessdate=13 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114180444/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/05/blank/key/sprachen.html |archivedate=14 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This situation has been called a ''medial [[diglossia]]''. [[Swiss Standard German]] is used in the Swiss education system, whereas [[Austrian Standard German]] is officially used in the Austrian education system.\n\nA mixture of dialect and standard does not normally occur in Northern Germany either. The traditional varieties there are Low German, whereas Standard German is a High German \"variety\". Because their linguistic distance to it is greater, they do not mesh with Standard German the way that High German dialects (such as Bavarian, Swabian, Hessian) can.\n\n== Dialects ==\n{{Main|German dialects}}\n[[File:Continental West Germanic languages.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] dialects]]\n\nGerman is a member of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[language family|family of languages]], which in turn is part of the [[Indo-European language family]]. The German dialects are the traditional local varieties; many of them are hardly understandable to someone who knows only standard German, and they have great differences in [[lexicon]], [[phonology]] and [[syntax]]. If a narrow definition of [[language]] based on [[mutual intelligibility]] is used, many German dialects are considered to be separate languages (for instance in the [[Ethnologue]]). However, such a point of view is unusual in German linguistics.<ref name=\"Ammon, 2014\" />\n\nThe German dialect continuum is traditionally divided most broadly into [[High German languages|High German]] and [[Low German]], also called [[Lower Saxony|Low Saxon]]. However, historically, High German dialects and Low Saxon/Low German dialects do not belong to the same language. Nevertheless, in today's Germany, Low Saxon/Low German is often perceived as a dialectal variation of Standard German on a functional level even by many native speakers. The same phenomenon is found in the eastern Netherlands, as the traditional dialects are not always identified with their Low Saxon/Low German origins, but with Dutch.<ref>[[:nl:Nederduits]]</ref>\n\nThe variation among the German dialects is considerable, with often only neighbouring dialects being mutually intelligible. Some dialects are not intelligible to people who know only Standard German. However, all German dialects belong to the dialect continuum of High German and Low Saxon.\n\n=== Low German/Low Saxon ===\n{{Main|Low German}}\n[[File:Map of the Low German Dialects.svg|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] (yellow) and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] (orange) dialects]]\n[[Middle Low German]] was the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Hanseatic League]]. It was the predominant language in Northern Germany until the 16th century. In 1534, the [[Luther Bible]] was published. The translation is considered to be an important step towards the evolution of the [[Early New High German]]. It aimed to be understandable to a broad audience and was based mainly on [[Central German|Central]] and [[Upper German]] varieties. The Early New High German language gained more prestige than [[Low German]] and became the language of science and literature. Around the same time, the Hanseatic League, based around northern ports, lost its importance as new trade routes to [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]] were established, and the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany.\n\nThe 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass [[education]] in [[Standard German]] in schools. Gradually, Low German came to be politically viewed as a mere dialect spoken by the uneducated. Today, Low Saxon can be divided in two groups: Low Saxon varieties with a reasonable Standard German influx{{clarify|date=September 2012}} and varieties of Standard German with a Low Saxon influence known as {{lang|de|[[Missingsch]]}}. Sometimes, Low Saxon and [[Low Franconian]] varieties are grouped together because both are unaffected by the High German consonant shift. However, the proportion of the population who can understand and speak it has decreased continuously since [[World War II]]. The largest cities in the Low German area are [[Hamburg]] and [[Dortmund]].\n\n=== Low Franconian ===\n[[File:Niederfr\u00e4nkisch.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian dialects]]]]\nThe [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] dialects are the dialects that are more closely related to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] than to [[Low German]]. Most of the Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Belgium]], where they are considered as dialects of Dutch, which is itself a Low Franconian language. In Germany, Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the northwest of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], along the [[Lower Rhine]]. The Low Franconian dialects spoken in Germany are referred to as [[Meuse-Rhenish]] or Low Rhenish. In the north of the German Low Franconian language area, North Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as Cleverlands or as dialects of [[South Guelderish]]) are spoken. These dialects are more closely related to Dutch (also North Low Franconian) than the South Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as East [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] and, east of the [[Rhine]], [[Bergish dialects|Bergish]]), which are spoken in the south of the German Low Franconian language area. The South Low Franconian dialects are more closely related to Limburgish than to Dutch, and are transitional dialects between Low Franconian and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] ([[Central Franconian dialects|Central Franconian]]). The [[East Bergish]] dialects are the easternmost Low Franconian dialects, and are transitional dialects between North- and South Low Franconian, and [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] (Low German), with most of its features however being North Low Franconian. The largest cities in the German Low Franconian area are [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and [[Duisburg]].\n\n=== High German ===\n{{Main|High German languages}}\n[[File:Mitteldeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Central German]] dialects]]\n[[File:Fr\u00e4nkisches Sprachgebiet.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] ([[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]], [[Central Franconian dialects|Central-]] and [[Rhine Franconian dialects|Rhine Franconian]], and [[High Franconian German|High Franconian)]]]]\nThe High German dialects consist of the [[Central German]], [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]], and [[Upper German language|Upper German]] dialects. The High Franconian dialects are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. The High German varieties spoken by the [[Ashkenazi Jew]]s have several unique features, and are considered as a separate language, [[Yiddish]], written with the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. \n\n==== Central German ====\n\nThe [[Central German]] dialects are spoken in Central Germany, from [[Aachen]] in the west to [[G\u00f6rlitz]] in the east. They consist of [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] in the west ([[West Central German]]), and non-Franconian dialects in the east ([[East Central German]]). Modern Standard German is mostly based on Central German dialects.\n\nThe Franconian, '''West Central German''' dialects are the [[Central Franconian dialects]] ([[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] and [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian]]), and the [[Rhine Franconian dialects]] ([[Hessian dialects|Hessian]] and [[Palatine German language|Palatine]]). These dialects are considered as\n* German in Germany and Belgium\n* [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] in Luxembourg\n* [[Lorraine Franconian]] (spoken in [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]]) and as a Rhine Franconian variant of [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] (spoken in [[Alsace bossue]] only) in France\n* [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] or [[Kerkrade dialect]] in the Netherlands.\nLuxembourgish as well as the [[Transylvanian Saxon dialect]] spoken in [[Transylvania]] are based on Moselle Franconian dialects. The largest cities in the Franconian Central German area are [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt]].\n\nFurther east, the non-Franconian, '''East Central German''' dialects are spoken ([[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]], [[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]], [[Erzgebirgisch|Ore Mountainian]], and [[Lausitzisch-neum\u00e4rkisch dialects|Lusatian-New Markish]], and earlier, in the then German-speaking parts of [[Silesia]] also [[Silesian German|Silesian]], and in then German southern [[East Prussia]] also [[High Prussian dialect|High Prussian]]). The largest cities in the East Central German area are [[Berlin]] and [[Leipzig]].\n\n==== High Franconian ====\n\nThe [[High Franconian German|High Franconian dialects]] are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. They consist of the [[East Franconian German|East-]] and [[South Franconian German|South Franconian]] dialects.\n\nThe East Franconian dialect branch is one of the most spoken dialect branches in Germany. These dialects are spoken in the region of [[Franconia]] and in the central parts of [[Saxony|Saxon]] [[Vogtland]]. Franconia consists of the [[Bavaria]]n districts of [[Upper Franconia|Upper-]], [[Middle Franconia|Middle-]], and [[Lower Franconia]], the region of [[South Thuringia]] ([[Thuringia]]), and the eastern parts of the region of [[Heilbronn-Franken]] ([[Tauber Franconia]] and Hohenlohe) in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The largest cities in the East Franconian area are [[Nuremberg]] and [[W\u00fcrzburg]].\n\nSouth Franconian is mainly spoken in northern Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Germany, but also in the northeasternmost part of the region of [[Alsace]] in France. While these dialects are considered as dialects of German in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, they are considered as dialects of [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] in Alsace (most Alsatian dialects are however [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]]). The largest cities in the South Franconian area are [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Heilbronn]].\n\n==== Upper German ====\n[[File:Oberdeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Upper German]] and [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]] (transitional between Central- and Upper German) dialects]]\nThe [[Upper German]] dialects are the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] in the west, and the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian dialects]] in the east.\n\n===== Alemannic =====\nAlemannic dialects are spoken in [[Switzerland]] ([[High Alemannic German|High Alemannic]] in the densely populated [[Swiss Plateau]], in the south also [[Highest Alemannic German|Highest Alemannic]], and [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]] in [[Basel]]), Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ([[Swabian German|Swabian]] and Low Alemannic, in the southwest also High Alemannic), [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Bavarian Swabia]] (Swabian, in the southwesternmost part also Low Alemannic), [[Vorarlberg]] (Low-, High-, and Highest Alemannic), [[Alsace]] (Low Alemannic, in the southernmost part also High Alemannic), [[Liechtenstein]] (High- and Highest Alemannic), and in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolean]] [[Reutte District|district of Reutte]] (Swabian). The Alemannic dialects are considered as [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] in Alsace. The largest cities in the Alemannic area are [[Stuttgart]] and [[Z\u00fcrich]].\n\n===== Bavarian =====\nBavarian dialects are spoken in [[Austria]] ([[Vienna]], [[Lower Austria|Lower-]] and [[Upper Austria]], [[Styria]], [[Carinthia]], [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Burgenland]], and in most parts of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]), [[Bavaria]] ([[Upper Bavaria|Upper-]] and [[Lower Bavaria]] as well as [[Upper Palatinate]]), [[South Tyrol]], southwesternmost [[Saxony]] (Southern [[Vogtl\u00e4ndisch dialect|Vogtlandian]]), and in the Swiss village of [[Samnaun]]. The largest cities in the Bavarian area are [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|German grammar}}\n\nGerman is a [[fusional language]] with a moderate degree of [[inflection]], with three [[grammatical gender]]s; as such, there can be a large number of words derived from the same root.\n\n=== Noun inflection ===\n[[File:DE-def-art-declensions-en.svg|thumb|Declension of the German definite articles (all equivalent to English \"the\").]]\n{{further information|Grammatical gender in German}}\n[[German nouns]] inflect by case, gender and number:\n* four [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]].\n* three [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine and neuter. Word endings sometimes reveal grammatical gender: for instance, nouns ending in {{lang|de|-ung}} (-ing), {{lang|de|-schaft}} (-ship), {{lang|de|-keit}} or {{lang|de|heit}} (-hood, -ness) are feminine, and nouns ending in {{lang|de|-chen}} or {{lang|de|-lein}} ([[diminutive]] forms) are neuter and nouns ending in {{lang|de|-ismus}} ([[-ism]]) are masculine. Others are more variable, sometimes depending on the region in which the language is spoken; and some endings are not restricted to one gender, e.g. {{lang|de|-er}} ([[agent noun|-er]]), e.g. {{lang|de|Feier}} (feminine), celebration, party, {{lang|de|Arbeiter}} (masculine), labourer, and {{lang|de|Gewitter}} (neuter), thunderstorm.\n* two numbers: singular and plural.\n\nThis degree of inflection is considerably less than in [[Old High German]] and other old [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]], and it is also somewhat less than, for instance, [[Old English]], modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] or [[Russian language|Russian]]. The three genders have collapsed in the plural. With four cases and three genders plus plural, there are 16 permutations of case and gender/number of the article (not the nouns), but there are only six forms of the [[article (grammar)|definite article]], which together cover all 16 permutations. In nouns, inflection for case is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns only in the genitive (only in archaic use in the dative), and even this is losing ground to substitutes in informal speech.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barbour|first1=Stephen|last2=Stevenson|first2=Patrick|title=Variation in German|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-35704-7|pages=160-163}}</ref> The dative noun ending is considered archaic or at least old-fashioned in almost all contexts and is almost always dropped even in writing, except in proverbs and other petrified forms. Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive, dative and accusative in the singular. Feminine nouns are not declined in the singular. The plural has an inflection for the dative. In total, seven inflectional endings (not counting plural markers) exist in German: {{lang|de|-s, -es, -n, -ns, -en, -ens, -e}}.\n\nIn German orthography, nouns and most words with the syntactical function of nouns are capitalised to make it easier for readers to determine the function of a word within a sentence ({{lang|de|Am Freitag ging ich einkaufen.}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"On Friday I went shopping.\"; {{lang|de|Eines Tages kreuzte er endlich auf.}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"One day he finally showed up.\") This convention is almost unique to German today (shared perhaps only by the closely related [[Luxembourgish language]] and several insular dialects of the [[North Frisian language]]), but it was historically common in other languages such as Danish (which abolished the capitalization of nouns in 1948) and English.\n\nLike the other Germanic languages, German forms noun [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] in which the first noun modifies the category given by the second,: {{lang|de|Hundeh\u00fctte}} (\"dog hut\"; specifically: \"dog kennel\"). Unlike English, whose newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in \"open\" with separating spaces, German (like some other Germanic languages) nearly always uses the \"closed\" form without spaces, for example: {{lang|de|Baumhaus}} (\"tree house\"). Like English, German allows arbitrarily long compounds in theory (see also [[English compounds]]). The longest German word verified to be actually in (albeit very limited) use is {{lang|de|[[Rinderkennzeichnungs- und Rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz|Rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz]]}}, which, literally translated, is \"beef labelling supervision duty assignment law\" [from {{lang|de|Rind}} (cattle), {{lang|de|Fleisch}} (meat), {{lang|de|Etikettierung(s)}} (labelling), {{lang|de|\u00dcberwachung(s)}} (supervision), {{lang|de|Aufgaben}} (duties), {{lang|de|\u00dcbertragung(s)}} (assignment), {{lang|de|Gesetz}} (law)]. However, examples like this are perceived by native speakers as excessively bureaucratic, stylistically awkward or even satirical.\n\n=== Verb inflection ===\n{{Main|German verbs}}\n\nThe inflection of standard German verbs includes:\n* two main [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] classes: [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] and [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] (as in English). Additionally, there is a third class, known as mixed verbs, whose conjugation combines features of both the strong and weak patterns.\n* three [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second and third.\n* two [[grammatical number|numbers]]: singular and plural.\n* three [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[realis mood|indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (in addition to [[infinitive]])\n* two [[voice (grammar)|voices]]: active and passive. The passive voice uses auxiliary verbs and is divisible into static and dynamic. Static forms show a constant state and use the verb \u2019\u2019to be\u2019\u2019 (sein). Dynamic forms show an action and use the verb \u201cto become\u2019\u2019 (werden).\n* two [[grammatical tense|tenses]] without auxiliary verbs ([[present tense|present]] and [[preterite]]) and four tenses constructed with auxiliary verbs ([[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], [[pluperfect]], [[future tense|future]] and [[future perfect]]).\n* the distinction between [[grammatical aspect]]s is rendered by combined use of subjunctive and/or preterite marking so the plain indicative voice uses neither of those two markers; the subjunctive by itself conveys secondhand information{{clarify|date=September 2012}}; subjunctive plus preterite marks the conditional state; and the preterite alone shows either plain indicative (in the past), or functions as a (literal) alternative for either second-hand-information or the conditional state of the verb, when necessary for clarity.\n* the distinction between perfect and [[continuous and progressive aspects|progressive aspect]] is and has, at every stage of development, been a productive category of the older language and in nearly all documented dialects, but, strangely enough, it is now rigorously excluded from written usage in its present normalised form.\n* disambiguation of completed vs. uncompleted forms is widely observed and regularly generated by common prefixes (''{{wiktde|blicken}}'' [to look], ''{{wiktde|erblicken}}'' [to see&nbsp;\u2013 unrelated form: {{wiktde|sehen}}]).\n\n==== Verb prefixes ====\nThe meaning of basic verbs can be expanded and sometimes radically changed through the use of a number of prefixes. Some prefixes have a specific meaning; the prefix '''{{lang|de|zer-}}''' refers to destruction, as in {{lang|de|'''zer'''rei\u00dfen}} (to tear apart), {{lang|de|'''zer'''brechen}} (to break apart), {{lang|de|'''zer'''schneiden}} (to cut apart). Other prefixes have only the vaguest meaning in themselves; '''{{lang|de|ver-}}''' is found in a number of verbs with a large variety of meanings, as in {{lang|de|'''ver'''suchen}} (to try) from {{lang|de|suchen}} (to seek), {{lang|de|'''ver'''nehmen}} (to interrogate) from {{lang|de|nehmen}} (to take), {{lang|de|'''ver'''teilen}} (to distribute) from {{lang|de|teilen}} (to share), {{lang|de|'''ver'''stehen}} (to understand) from {{lang|de|stehen}} (to stand).\n\nOther examples include the following:\n{{lang|de|haften}} (to stick), {{lang|de|'''ver'''haften}} (to detain); {{lang|de|kaufen}} (to buy), {{lang|de|'''ver'''kaufen}} (to sell); {{lang|de|h\u00f6ren}} (to hear), {{lang|de|'''auf'''h\u00f6ren}} (to cease); {{lang|de|fahren}} (to drive), {{lang|de|'''er'''fahren}} (to experience).\n\nMany [[German verbs]] have a separable prefix, often with an adverbial function. In [[finite verb]] forms, it is split off and moved to the end of the clause and is hence considered by some to be a \"resultative particle\". For example, {{lang|de|mitgehen}}, meaning \"to go along\", would be split, giving {{lang|de|Gehen Sie mit?}} (Literal: \"Go you with?\"; Idiomatic: \"Are you going along?\").\n\nIndeed, several [[parenthetical referencing|parenthetical]] clauses may occur between the prefix of a finite verb and its complement (ankommen = to arrive, er kam an = he arrived, er ist angekommen = he has arrived):\n: {{lang|de|Er '''kam''' am Freitagabend nach einem harten Arbeitstag und dem \u00fcblichen \u00c4rger, der ihn schon seit Jahren immer wieder an seinem Arbeitsplatz plagt, mit fraglicher Freude auf ein Mahl, das seine Frau ihm, wie er hoffte, bereits aufgetischt hatte, endlich zu Hause '''an'''.}}\nA selectively literal translation of this example to illustrate the point might look like this:\n: He \"came\" on Friday evening, after a hard day at work and the usual annoyances that had time and again been troubling him for years now at his workplace, with questionable joy, to a meal which, as he hoped, his wife had already put on the table, finally at home \"on\".\n\n=== Word order ===\nGerman word order is generally with the [[V2 word order]] restriction and also with the [[SOV word order]] restriction for main [[clause]]s. For polar questions, exclamations and wishes, the [[finite verb]] always has the first position. In subordinate clauses, the verb occurs at the very end.\n\nGerman requires for a verbal element (main verb or [[auxiliary verb]]) to appear [[V2 word order|second in the sentence]]. The verb is preceded by the [[topic\u2013comment|topic]] of the sentence. The element in focus appears at the end of the sentence. For a sentence without an auxiliary, these are some possibilities:\n\n: {{lang|de|Der alte Mann gab mir gestern das Buch.}} (The old man gave me yesterday the book; normal order)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab mir gestern der alte Mann.}} (The book gave [to] me yesterday the old man)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab der alte Mann mir gestern.}} (The book gave the old man [to] me yesterday)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab mir der alte Mann gestern.}} (The book gave [to] me the old man yesterday)\n\n: {{lang|de|Gestern gab mir der alte Mann das Buch.}} (Yesterday gave [to] me the old man the book, normal order)\n: {{lang|de|Mir gab der alte Mann das Buch gestern.}} ([To] me gave the old man the book yesterday (entailing: as for you, it was another date))\n\nThe position of a noun in a German sentence has no bearing on its being a subject, an object or another argument. In a [[sentence (linguistics)|declarative sentence]] in English, if the subject does not occur before the predicate, the sentence could well be misunderstood.\n\nHowever, German's flexibile word order allows one to emphasise specific words:\n\nNormal word order:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat gestern um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro.}}\n:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand his office.\n\nObject in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Sein B\u00fcro betrat der Direktor gestern um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand.}}\n:: His office entered the manager yesterday at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand.\n: The object {{lang|de|Sein B\u00fcro}} (his office) is thus highlighted; it could be the topic of the next sentence.\n\nAdverb of time in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern betrat der Direktor um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro. (aber heute ohne Schirm)}}\n:: Yesterday entered the manager at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand his office. (but today without umbrella)\n\nBoth time expressions in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr betrat der Direktor mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro}}.\n:: Yesterday at 10 o'clock entered the manager with an umbrella in the hand his office.\n: The full-time specification {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr}} is highlighted.\n\nAnother possibility:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr betrat der Direktor sein B\u00fcro mit einem Schirm in der Hand}}.\n:: Yesterday at 10 o'clock the manager entered his office with an umbrella in his hand.\n: Both the time specification and the fact he carried an umbrella are accentuated.\n\nSwapped adverbs:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat mit einem Schirm in der Hand gestern um 10 Uhr sein B\u00fcro.}}\n:: The manager entered with an umbrella in the hand yesterday at 10 o'clock his office.\n: The phrase {{lang|de|mit einem Schirm in der Hand}} is highlighted.\n\nSwapped object:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat gestern um 10 Uhr sein B\u00fcro mit einem Schirm in der Hand.}}\n:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o'clock his office with an umbrella in his hand.\n: The time specification and the object {{lang|de|sein B\u00fcro}} (his office) are lightly accentuated.\n\nThe flexible word order also allows one to use language \"tools\" (such as [[poetic meter]] and [[figures of speech]]) more freely.\n\n==== Auxiliary verbs ====\nWhen an [[auxiliary verb]] is present, it appears in second position, and the main verb appears at the end. This occurs notably in the creation of the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect tense]]. Many word orders are still possible:\n\n:{{lang|de|Der alte Mann hat mir heute das Buch gegeben.}} (The old man has me today the book given.)\n:{{lang|de|Das Buch hat der alte Mann mir heute gegeben.}} ('''''The book''''' has the old man me today given.)\n:{{lang|de|Heute hat der alte Mann mir das Buch gegeben.}} ('''''Today''''' has the old man me the book given.)\n\nThe main verb may appear in first position to put stress on the action itself. The [[auxiliary verb]] is still in second position.\n\n:{{lang|de|Gegeben hat mir der alte Mann das Buch heute.}} ('''''Given''''' has me the old man the book ''''today''''.) The bare fact that the book has been given is emphasized, as well as 'today'.\n\n==== Modal verbs ====\nSentences using modal verbs place the infinitive at the end. For example, the English sentence \"Should he go home?\" would be rearranged in German to say \"Should he (to) home go?\" ({{lang|de|Soll er nach Hause gehen?}}). Thus, in sentences with several subordinate or relative clauses, the infinitives are clustered at the end. Compare the similar clustering of prepositions in the following (highly contrived) English sentence: \"What did you bring that book that I do not like to be read to out of up for?\"\n\n==== Multiple infinitives ====\nGerman subordinate clauses have all verbs clustered at the end. Given that auxiliaries encode [[future]], [[passive voice|passive]], [[modality (semiotics)|modality]], and the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], very long chains of verbs at the end of the sentence can occur. In these constructions, the past participle in {{lang|de|ge-}} is often replaced by the infinitive.\n\n: ''{{lang|de|Man nimmt an, dass der Deserteur wohl erschossen}}<sub>V</sub> {{lang|de|worden}}<sub>psv</sub> {{lang|de|sein}}<sub>perf</sub> {{lang|de|soll}}<sub>mod</sub>''\n: One suspects that the deserter probably shot become be should.\n: (\"It is suspected that the deserter probably had been shot\")\n\n:: {{lang|de|Er wusste nicht, dass der Agent einen Nachschl\u00fcssel hatte machen lassen}}\n:: He knew not that the agent a picklock had make let\n\n:: {{lang|de|Er wusste nicht, dass der Agent einen Nachschl\u00fcssel machen lassen hatte}}\n:: He knew not that the agent a picklock make let had\n: (\"He did not know that the agent had had a picklock made\")\n\nThe order at the end of such strings is subject to variation, but the latter version is unusual.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n[[File:Duden 25Auflage.JPG|upright|thumb|Volume 1\u2013\"The Spelling Dictionary\"\u2013of the 25 edition of the ''[[Duden]]'' dictionary.]]\n[[File:OeWB 42Aufl.jpg|upright|thumb|42nd edition of the {{lang|de|[[\u00d6sterreichisches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}} (\"Austrian Dictionary\").]]\n\nMost German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the European language family.{{citation needed|reason=This was cited in the lead to a source that said nothing of the sort. Also, 'derives vocabulary from the Germanic branch' is problematic, as technically English is a member of is branch (so the 'however' in the following sentence makes no sense). Assuming what is meant is that the majority of agerman words are descended from older German words and German has historically had a relatively small number of foreign loanwords, this is probably correct, but it still needs a source.|date=July 2017}} However, there is a significant amount of loanwords from other languages, in particular from [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]], French<ref>some of which might be reborrowings from Germanic [[Frankish language|Frankish]]</ref> and most recently English.<ref>This phenomenon is known as {{lang|de|[[Denglisch]]}} in German or as [[Germish]] or Denglish in English.</ref> In the early 19th century, [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]] estimated that one fifth of the total German vocabulary was of French or Latin origin.<ref>Uwe P\u00f6rksen, German Academy for Language and Literature\u2019s Jahrbuch [Yearbook] 2007 (Wallstein Verlag, G\u00f6ttingen 2008, pp. 121\u2013130)</ref>\n\nLatin words were already imported into the predecessor of the German language during the [[Roman Empire]] and underwent all the characteristic phonetic changes in German. Their origin is thus no longer recognizable for most speakers (e.g. {{lang|de|Pforte}}, {{lang|de|Tafel}}, {{lang|de|Mauer}}, {{lang|de|K\u00e4se}}, {{lang|de|K\u00f6ln}} from Latin {{lang|la|porta}}, {{lang|la|tabula}}, {{lang|la|murus}}, {{lang|la|caseus}}, {{lang|la|Colonia}}). Borrowing from Latin continued after the fall of the Roman Empire during Christianization, mediated by the church and monasteries. Another important influx of Latin words can be observed during [[Renaissance humanism]]. In a scholarly context, the borrowings from Latin have continued until today, in the last few decades often indirectly through borrowings from English. During the 15th to 17th centuries, the influence of Italian was great, leading to many Italian loanwords in the fields of architecture, finance, and music. The influence of the French language in the 17th to 19th centuries resulted in an even greater import of French words. The English influence was already present in the 19th century, but it did not become dominant until the second half of the 20th century.\n\nAt the same time, the effectiveness of the German language in forming equivalents for foreign words from its inherited Germanic stem repertory is great.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Thus, [[Notker Labeo]] was able to translate Aristotelian treatises in pure (Old High) German in the decades after the year 1000. The tradition of loan translation was revitalized in the 18th century, with linguists like [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]], who introduced close to 300 words that are still used in modern German. Even today, there are movements that try to promote the {{lang|de|[[Ersatz]]}} (substitution) of foreign words deemed unnecessary with German alternatives.<ref>{{cite web|author=Verein Deutsche Sprache e.V. |url=http://vds-ev.de/anglizismenindex |title=Verein Deutsche Sprache e.V. \u2013 Der Anglizismen-Index |publisher=Vds-ev.de |date= |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref> It is claimed that this would also help in spreading modern or scientific notions among the less educated and as well democratise public life.\n\nAs in English, there are many pairs of [[synonym]]s due to the enrichment of the Germanic vocabulary with [[loanword]]s from Latin and Latinized Greek. These words often have different connotations from their Germanic counterparts and are usually perceived as more scholarly.\n\n* {{lang|de|Historie, historisch}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"history, historical\", ({{lang|de|Geschichte, geschichtlich}})\n* {{lang|de|Humanit\u00e4t, human}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"humaneness, humane\", ({{lang|de|Menschlichkeit, menschlich}})<ref>Note that {{lang|de|menschlich}}, and occasionally {{lang|de|human}}, may also mean \"human, pertaining to humans,\" whereas {{lang|de|Menschlichkeit}} and {{lang|de|Humanit\u00e4t}} never mean \"humanity, human race,\" which translates to {{lang|de|Menschheit}}.</ref>\n* {{lang|de|Millennium}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"millennium\", ({{lang|de|Jahrtausend}})\n* {{lang|de|Perzeption}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"perception\", ({{lang|de|Wahrnehmung}})\n* {{lang|de|Vokabular}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"vocabulary\", ({{lang|de|Wortschatz}})\n\nThe size of the vocabulary of German is difficult to estimate. The {{lang|de|[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}} (''The German Dictionary'') initiated by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]] already contained over 330,000 headwords in its first edition.

Schraegschrift.jpg|right|thumb|[[German alphabet]], one of Austria's elementary school handwriting programs]]\n[[File:Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift.png|thumb|[[German alphabet]], elementary school handwriting program in some West German states]]\n\nGerman is written in the Latin alphabet. In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with [[Umlaut (diacritic)|Umlaut]], namely ''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'', as well as the eszett or {{lang|de|[[scharfes s]]}} (sharp s): ''[[\u00df]]''. In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, ''ss'' is used instead of ''\u00df''. Since ''\u00df'' can never occur at the beginning of a word, it has no traditional [[Capital_\u1e9e|uppercase form]].\n\nWritten texts in German are easily recognisable as such by distinguishing features such as [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] and certain [[German orthography|orthographical]] features&nbsp;\u2013 German is the only major language that capitalizes all nouns, a relic of a widespread practice in Northern Europe in the early modern era (including English for a while, in the 1700s)&nbsp;\u2013 and the frequent occurrence of long compounds. The longest German word that has been published is {{lang|de|[[Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizit\u00e4tenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft]]}} made of 79 characters. Because legibility and convenience set certain boundaries, compounds consisting of more than three or four nouns are almost exclusively found in humorous contexts. (In contrast, although English can also string nouns together, it usually separates the nouns with spaces. For example, \"toilet bowl cleaner\".)\n\n=== Present ===\nBefore the [[German orthography reform of 1996]], ''\u00df'' replaced ''ss'' after [[vowel length|long vowels]] and [[diphthong]]s and before consonants, word-, or partial-word-endings. In reformed spelling, ''\u00df'' replaces ''ss'' only after long vowels and diphthongs.\n\nSince there is no traditional capital form of ''\u00df'', it was replaced by ''SS'' when capitalization was required. For example, {{lang|de|Ma\u00dfband}} (tape measure) became {{lang|de|MASSBAND}} in capitals. An exception was the use of \u00df in legal documents and forms when capitalizing names. To avoid confusion with similar names, lower case ''\u00df'' was maintained (so, \"{{lang|de|KRE\u00dfLEIN}}\" instead of \"{{lang|de|KRESSLEIN}}\"). [[Capital \u00df]] (\u1e9e) was ultimately adopted into German orthography in 2017, ending a long orthographic debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1033265/germanys-century-long-debate-over-a-missing-letter-in-its-alphabet|title=Germany has ended a century-long debate over a missing letter in its alphabet|last=Ha|first=Thu-Huong|language=English|accessdate=5 December 2017|quote=According to the council\u2019s 2017 spelling manual: When writing the uppercase [of \u00df], write SS. It\u2019s also possible to use the uppercase \u1e9e. Example: Stra\u00dfe \u2014 STRASSE \u2014 STRA\u1e9eE.}}</ref>\n\nUmlaut vowels (\u00e4, \u00f6, \u00fc) are commonly transcribed with ae, oe, and ue if the umlauts are not available on the keyboard or other medium used. In the same manner \u00df can be transcribed as ss. Some [[operating systems]] use key sequences to extend the set of possible characters to include, amongst other things, umlauts; in [[Microsoft Windows]] this is done using [[Alt codes]]. German readers understand these transcriptions (although they appear unusual), but they are avoided if the regular umlauts are available because they are a makeshift, not proper spelling. (In Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, city and family names exist where the extra e has a vowel lengthening effect, e.g. ''Raesfeld'' {{IPA-de|\u02c8ra\u02d0sf\u025blt|}}, ''Coesfeld'' {{IPA|[\u02c8ko\u02d0sf\u025blt]}} and ''Itzehoe'' {{IPA|[\u026ats\u0259\u02c8ho\u02d0]}}, but this use of the letter e after a/o/u does not occur in the present-day spelling of words other than [[proper noun]]s.)\n\n{{Listen\n|filename = German alphabet-2.ogg\n|title = German alphabet\n|description = (Listen to a German speaker recite the alphabet in German)\n}}\n\nThere is no general agreement on where letters with umlauts occur in the sorting sequence. Telephone directories treat them by replacing them with the base vowel followed by an e. Some dictionaries sort each umlauted vowel as a separate letter after the base vowel, but more commonly words with umlauts are ordered immediately after the same word without umlauts. As an example in a [[telephone directory|telephone book]] {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} occurs after {{lang|de|Adressenverlage}} but before {{lang|de|Anlagenbauer}} (because \u00c4 is replaced by Ae). In a dictionary {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} comes after {{lang|de|Arzt}}, but in some dictionaries {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} and all other words starting with ''\u00c4'' may occur after all words starting with ''A''. In some older dictionaries or indexes, initial ''Sch'' and ''St'' are treated as separate letters and are listed as separate entries after ''S'', but they are usually treated as S+C+H and S+T.\n\nWritten German also typically uses an alternative opening inverted comma ([[quotation mark]]) as in {{lang|de|\u201eGuten Morgen!\u201c}}.\n\n=== Past ===\n[[File:Fraktur-ru.jpg|thumb|A Russian dictionary from 1931, showing the \"German alphabet\"&nbsp;\u2013 the 3rd and 4th columns of each half are [[Fraktur]] and [[Kurrent]] respectively, with the footnote explaining [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] used in Fraktur.]]\n{{Further information|2nd Orthographic Conference (German)|Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|German orthography reform of 1944}}\nUntil the early 20th century, German was mostly printed in [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s (mostly in [[Fraktur]], but also in [[Schwabacher]]) and written in corresponding [[penmanship|handwriting]] (for example [[Kurrent]] and [[S\u00fctterlin]]). These variants of the Latin alphabet are very different from the serif or [[sans-serif]] [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] typefaces used today, and the handwritten forms in particular are difficult for the untrained to read. The printed forms, however, were claimed by some to be more readable when used for [[Germanic languages]].<ref>Adolf Reinecke, {{lang|de|Die deutsche Buchstabenschrift: ihre Entstehung und Entwicklung, ihre Zweckm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit und v\u00f6lkische Bedeutung}}, Leipzig, Hasert, 1910</ref> (Often, foreign names in a text were printed in an Antiqua typeface even though the rest of the text was in Fraktur.) The [[Nazism|Nazis]] initially promoted Fraktur and Schwabacher because they were considered [[Aryan]], but they abolished them in 1941, claiming that these letters were Jewish.<ref>[http://www.ligaturix.de/bormann.htm Facsimile of Bormann's Memorandum (in German)]<br />\nThe memorandum itself is typed in Antiqua, but the [[NSDAP]] [[letterhead]] is printed in Fraktur.<br />\"For general attention, on behalf of the F\u00fchrer, I make the following announcement:<br />It is wrong to regard or to describe the so-called Gothic script as a German script. In reality, the so-called Gothic script consists of Schwabach Jew letters. Just as they later took control of the newspapers, upon the introduction of printing the Jews residing in Germany took control of the printing presses and thus in Germany the Schwabach Jew letters were forcefully introduced.<br />Today the F\u00fchrer, talking with Herr Reichsleiter Amann and Herr Book Publisher Adolf M\u00fcller, has decided that in the future the Antiqua script is to be described as normal script. All printed materials are to be gradually converted to this normal script. As soon as is feasible in terms of textbooks, only the normal script will be taught in village and state schools.<br />The use of the Schwabach Jew letters by officials will in future cease; appointment certifications for functionaries, street signs, and so forth will in future be produced only in normal script.<br />On behalf of the F\u00fchrer, Herr Reichsleiter Amann will in future convert those newspapers and periodicals that already have foreign distribution, or whose foreign distribution is desired, to normal script\".</ref> It is also believed that the Nazi r\u00e9gime had banned this script as they realized that Fraktur would inhibit communication in the territories occupied during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Albert |last=Kapr |title=Fraktur: Form und Geschichte der gebrochenen Schriften |location=Mainz |publisher=H. Schmidt |year=1993 |page=81 |isbn=3-87439-260-0 }}</ref>\n\nThe Fraktur script however remains present in everyday life in pub signs, beer brands and other forms of advertisement, where it is used to convey a certain rusticality and antiquity.\n\nA proper use of the [[long s]], ({{lang|de|langes s}}), [[long s|\u017f]], is essential for writing German text in [[Fraktur]] typefaces. Many [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] typefaces include the [[long s]] also. A specific set of rules applies for the use of long s in German text, but nowadays it is rarely used in Antiqua typesetting. Any lower case \"s\" at the beginning of a syllable would be a long s, as opposed to a terminal s or short s (the more common variation of the letter s), which marks the end of a syllable; for example, in differentiating between the words {{lang|de|Wach\u017ftube}} (guard-house) and {{lang|de|Wachstube}} (tube of polish/wax). One can easily decide which \"s\" to use by appropriate hyphenation, ({{lang|de|Wach-\u017ftube}} vs. {{lang|de|Wachs-tube}}). The long s only appears in [[lower case]].\n\n=== Reform of 1996 ===\n{{Main|German orthography reform of 1996}}\n\nThe orthography reform of 1996 led to public controversy and considerable dispute. The states ({{lang|de|Bundesl\u00e4nder}}) of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Bavaria]] would not accept it. The dispute landed at one point in the highest court, which made a short issue of it, claiming that the states had to decide for themselves and that only in schools could the reform be made the official rule&nbsp;\u2013 everybody else could continue writing as they had learned it. After 10 years, without any intervention by the federal parliament, a major revision was installed in 2006, just in time for the coming school year. In 2007, some traditional spellings were finally invalidated, whereas in 2008, on the other hand, many of the old [[comma]] rules were again put in force.\n\nThe most noticeable change was probably in the use of the letter ''\u00df'', called {{lang|de|scharfes s}} (''Sharp S'') or {{lang|de|ess-zett}} (pronounced ''ess-tsett''). Traditionally, this letter was used in three situations:\n\n# After a long vowel or vowel combination,\n# Before a ''t'', and\n# At the end of a syllable\n\nThus {{lang|de|F\u00fc\u00dfe}}, {{lang|de|pa\u00dft}}, and {{lang|de|da\u00df}}. Currently only the first rule is in effect, thus {{lang|de|F\u00fc\u00dfe}}, {{lang|de|passt}}, and {{lang|de|dass}}. The word {{lang|de|Fu\u00df}} 'foot' has the letter ''\u00df'' because it contains a long vowel, even though that letter occurs at the end of a syllable. The logic of this change is that an '\u00df' is a single letter whereas 'ss' obviously are two letters, so the same distinction applies as for instance between the words {{lang|de|den}} and {{lang|de|denn}}.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|German phonology}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\n[[File:De-Faust - Der Trag\u00f6die erster Teil-Prolog und Auf dem Theater-wikisource.ogg|thumb|Spoken German in [[Goethe's Faust]]]]\n\nIn German, vowels (excluding diphthongs; see below) are either ''short'' or ''long'', as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !! A !! \u00c4 !! E !! I !! O !! \u00d6 !! U !! \u00dc\n|-\n! short\n| {{IPA|/a/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/, /\u0259/}} || {{IPA|/\u026a/}} || {{IPA|/\u0254/}} || {{IPA|/\u0153/}} || {{IPA|/\u028a/}} || {{IPA|/\u028f/}}\n|-\n! long\n| {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/, /e\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}}\n|}\nShort {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is realized as {{IPA|[\u025b]}} in stressed syllables (including [[secondary stress]]), but as {{IPA|[\u0259]}} in unstressed syllables. Note that stressed short {{IPA|/\u025b/}} can be spelled either with ''e'' or with ''\u00e4'' (for instance, {{lang|de|h\u00e4tte}} \"would have\" and {{lang|de|Kette}} \"chain\" rhyme). In general, the short vowels are open and the long vowels are close. The one exception is the open {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} sound of long ''\u00c4''; in some varieties of standard German, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} have merged into {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}, removing this anomaly. In that case, pairs like {{lang|de|B\u00e4ren/Beeren}} 'bears/berries' or {{lang|de|\u00c4hre/Ehre}} 'spike (of wheat)/honour' become homophonous (see: [[Captain Bluebear]]).\n\nIn many varieties of standard German, an unstressed {{IPA|/\u025br/}} is not pronounced {{IPA|[\u0259r]}}, but vocalised to {{IPA|[\u0250]}}.\n\nWhether any particular vowel letter represents the long or short phoneme is not completely predictable, although the following regularities exist:\n* If a vowel (other than ''i'') is at the end of a syllable or followed by a single consonant, it is usually pronounced long (e.g. {{lang|de|Hof}} {{IPA|[ho\u02d0f]}}).\n* If a vowel is followed by ''h'' or if an ''i'' is followed by an ''e'', it is long.\n* If the vowel is followed by a double consonant (e.g. ''ff'', ''ss'' or ''tt''), ''ck'', ''tz'' or a [[consonant cluster]] (e.g. ''st'' or ''nd''), it is nearly always short (e.g. {{lang|de|hoffen}} {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0254f\u0259n]}}). Double consonants are used only for this function of marking preceding vowels as short; the consonant itself is never pronounced lengthened or doubled, in other words this is not a [[feeding order]] of [[gemination]] and then [[vowel shortening]].\nBoth of these rules have exceptions (e.g. {{lang|de|hat}} {{IPA|[hat]}} \"has\" is short despite the first rule; {{lang|de|Mond}} {{IPA|[mo\u02d0nt]}}, \"[[moon]]\" is long despite the second rule). For an ''i'' that is neither in the combination ''ie'' (making it long) nor followed by a double consonant or cluster (making it short), there is no general rule. In some cases, there are regional differences: In central Germany ([[Hessen]]), the ''o'' in the [[Noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper name]] \"Hoffmann\" is pronounced long, whereas most other Germans would pronounce it short; the same applies to the ''e'' in the geographical name \"[[Mecklenburg]]\" for people in that region. The word {{lang|de|St\u00e4dte}} \"cities\", is pronounced with a short vowel {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283t\u025bt\u0259]}} by some ([[Jan Hofer]], [[Das Erste|ARD Television]]) and with a long vowel {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283t\u025b\u02d0t\u0259]}} by others ([[Marietta Slomka]], [[ZDF]] Television). Finally, a vowel followed by ''ch'' can be short ({{lang|de|Fach}} {{IPA|[fax]}} \"compartment\", {{lang|de|K\u00fcche}} {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u028f\u00e7\u0259]}} \"kitchen\") or long ({{lang|de|Suche}} {{IPA|[\u02c8zu\u02d0x\u0259]}} \"search\", {{lang|de|B\u00fccher}} {{IPA|[\u02c8by\u02d0\u00e7\u0250]}} \"books\") almost at random. Thus, {{lang|de|Lache}} is homographous between {{IPA|[la\u02d0x\u0259]}} {{lang|de|Lache}} \"puddle\" and {{IPA|[lax\u0259]}} {{lang|de|Lache}} \"manner of laughing\" (colloquial) or {{lang|de|lache!}} \"laugh!\" (imperative).\n\nGerman vowels can form the following digraphs (in writing) and diphthongs (in pronunciation); note that the pronunciation of some of them (ei, \u00e4u, eu) is very different from what one would expect when considering the component letters:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! spelling\n| ai, ei, ay, ey || au || \u00e4u, eu\n|-\n! pronunciation\n| {{IPA|/a\u026a\u032f/}} || {{IPA|/a\u028a\u032f/}} || {{IPA|/\u0254\u028f\u032f/}}\n|}\nAdditionally, the digraph ''ie'' generally represents the phoneme {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, which is not a diphthong. In many varieties, an {{IPA|/r/}} at the end of a syllable is vocalised. However, a sequence of a vowel followed by such a vocalised {{IPA|/r/}} is not a phonemic diphthong: {{lang|de|B\u00e4r}} {{IPA|[b\u025b\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"bear\", {{lang|de|er}} {{IPA|[e\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"he\", {{lang|de|wir}} {{IPA|[vi\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"we\", {{lang|de|Tor}} {{IPA|[to\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"gate\", {{lang|de|kurz}} {{IPA|[k\u028a\u0250\u032fts]}} \"short\", {{lang|de|W\u00f6rter}} {{IPA|[v\u0153\u0250\u032ft\u0250]}} \"words\".\n\nIn most varieties of standard German, syllables that begin with a vowel are preceded by a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}}.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nWith approximately 25 phonemes, the German consonant system exhibits an average number of consonants in comparison with other languages. One of the more noteworthy ones is the unusual [[affricate]] {{IPA|/p\u0361f/}}.

In the [[syllable coda]], the allophone {{IPA|[\u0250]}} is found in many varieties.\n* <sup>3</sup> The voiceless stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} are [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] except when preceded by a [[sibilant]], exactly as in English.\n* <sup>4</sup>{{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} and {{IPA|/\u0292/}} occur only in words of foreign (usually English or French) origin.\n* Where a stressed syllable has an initial vowel, it is preceded by {{IPA|[\u0294]}}. As its presence is predictable from context, {{IPA|[\u0294]}} is not considered a phoneme.\n\n==== Consonant spellings ====\n* '''c''' standing by itself is not a German letter. In borrowed words, it is usually pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} (before \u00e4, \u00e4u, e, i, \u00f6, \u00fc, y) or {{IPA|[k]}} (before a, o, u, and consonants). The combination '''ck''' is, as in English, used to indicate that the preceding vowel is short.\n* '''ch''' occurs often and is pronounced either {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} (after \u00e4, ai, \u00e4u, e, ei, eu, i, \u00f6, \u00fc and consonants; in the diminutive suffix {{lang|de|-chen}}; and at the beginning of a word), {{IPA|[x]}} (after a, au, o, u), or {{IPA|[k]}} at the beginning of a word before a, o, u and consonants. '''Ch''' never occurs at the beginning of an originally German word. In borrowed words with initial Ch before front vowels ({{lang|de|Chemie}} \"chemistry\" etc.), {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} is considered standard. However, Upper Germans and Franconians (in the geographical sense) replace it with {{IPA|[k]}}, as German as a whole does before darker vowels and consonants such as in {{lang|de|Charakter}}, {{lang|de|Christentum}}. Middle Germans (except Franconians) will borrow a {{IPA|[\u0283]}} from the French model. Both agree in considering each other's variant,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} and Upper Germans also the standard in {{IPA|[\u00e7]}}, as particularly awkward and unusual.\n* '''dsch''' is pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0361\u0292]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Dschungel}} {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u0361\u0292\u028a\u014b\u0259l/}} \"jungle\") but appears in a few [[loanwords]] only.\n* '''f''' is pronounced {{IPA|[f]}} as in \"''f''ather\".\n* '''h''' is pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} as in \"''h''ome\" at the beginning of a syllable. After a vowel it is silent and only lengthens the vowel (e.g. {{lang|de|Reh}} {{IPA|[\u0281e\u02d0]}} = [[roe deer]]).\n* '''j''' is pronounced {{IPA|[j]}} in Germanic words ({{lang|de|Jahr}} {{IPA|[ja\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}}) (like \"y\" in \"year\"). In recent loanwords, it follows more or less the respective languages' pronunciations.\n* '''l''' is always pronounced {{IPA|[l]}}, never {{IPA|*[\u026b]}} (the English \"[[dark L]]\").\n* '''q''' only exists in combination with '''u''' and is pronounced {{IPA|[kv]}}. It appears in both Germanic and Latin words ({{lang|de|quer}} {{IPA|[kve\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}}; {{lang|de|Qualit\u00e4t}} {{IPA|[kvali\u02c8t\u025b\u02d0t]}}). But as most words containing q are Latinate, the letter is considerably rarer in German than it is in English.\n* '''r''' is usually pronounced in a [[guttural R|guttural]] fashion (a [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0281]}} or [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[\u0280]}}) in front of a vowel or consonant ({{lang|de|Rasen}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0281a\u02d0z\u0259n]}}; {{lang|de|Burg}} {{IPA|[b\u028a\u0281k]}}). In spoken German, however, it is commonly vocalised after a vowel ({{lang|de|er}} being pronounced rather like {{IPA|[\u02c8\u025b\u0250\u032f]}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{lang|de|Burg}} {{IPA|[b\u028a\u0250\u032fk]}}). In some varieties, the '''r''' is pronounced as a \"tongue-tip\" ''r'' (the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}).\n* '''s''' in German is pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} (as in \"''z''ebra\") if it forms the [[syllable onset]] (e.g. {{lang|de|Sohn}} {{IPA|[zo\u02d0n]}}), otherwise {{IPA|[s]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Bus}} {{IPA|[b\u028as]}}). In Austria, Switzerland, and Southern Germany, {{IPA|[s]}} occurs at syllable onset as well. A '''ss''' {{IPA|[s]}} indicates that the preceding vowel is short. '''st''' and '''sp''' at the beginning of words of German origin are pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283t]}} and {{IPA|[\u0283p]}}, respectively.\n* '''\u00df''' (a letter unique to German called {{lang|de|scharfes S}} or {{lang|de|[[\u00df|Eszett]]}}) was a ligature of a double '''s''' ''and'' of an '''sz''' and is always pronounced {{IPA|[s]}}. Originating in [[Blackletter]] typeface, it traditionally replaced '''ss''' at the end of a syllable (e.g. {{lang|de|ich muss}} \u2192 {{lang|de|ich mu\u00df}}; {{lang|de|ich m\u00fcsste}} \u2192 {{lang|de|ich m\u00fc\u00dfte}}); within a word it contrasts with '''ss''' {{IPA|[s]}} in indicating that the preceding vowel is long (compare {{lang|de|in Ma\u00dfen}} {{IPA|[\u026an \u02c8ma\u02d0s\u0259n]}} \"with moderation\" and {{lang|de|in Massen}} {{IPA|[\u026an \u02c8mas\u0259n]}} \"in loads\"). The use of '''\u00df''' has recently been limited by the latest German spelling reform and is no longer used for '''ss''' after a short vowel (e.g. {{lang|de|ich mu\u00df}} and {{lang|de|ich m\u00fc\u00dfte}} were always pronounced with a short U/\u00dc); Switzerland and Liechtenstein already abolished it in 1934.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mittelschulvorbereitung.ch/index.php?SUBJECT=&actualid=5 |title=Mittelschulvorbereitung Deutsch |publisher=Mittelschulvorbereitung.ch |date= |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref>\n* '''sch''' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (like \"sh\" in \"shine\").\n* '''tion''' in Latin loanwords is pronounced {{IPA|[tsi\u032fo\u02d0n]}}.\n* '''th''' is found, rarely, in loanwords and is pronounced {{IPA|[t]}} if the loanword is from Greek, and usually as in the original if the loanword is from English (though some, mostly older, speakers tend to replace the English th-sound with {{IPA|[s]}}).\n* '''v''' is pronounced {{IPA|[f]}} in a limited number of words of Germanic origin, such as {{lang|de|Vater}} {{IPA|[\u02c8fa\u02d0t\u0250]}}, {{lang|de|Vogel}} \"bird\", {{lang|de|von}} \"from, of\", {{lang|de|vor}} \"before, in front of\", {{lang|de|voll}} \"full\" and the prefix {{lang|de|ver-}}. It is also used in loanwords, where it is normally pronounced {{IPA|[v]}}. This pronunciation is common in words like {{lang|de|Vase}}, {{lang|de|Vikar}}, {{lang|de|Viktor}}, {{lang|de|Viper}}, {{lang|de|Ventil}}, {{lang|de|vulg\u00e4r}}, and English loanwords; however, pronunciation is {{IPA|[f]}} by some people in some in the very south. The only non-German word in which \"v\" is always pronounced \"f\" is {{lang|de|Eva}} (Eve).\n* '''w''' is pronounced {{IPA|[v]}} as in \"''v''acation\" (e.g. {{lang|de|was}} {{IPA|[vas]}}).\n* '''y''' is pronounced as {{IPA|[y]}} when long, and {{IPA|[\u028f]}} when short (as in {{lang|de|Hygiene}} {{IPA|[hy\u0261i\u032f\u02c8e\u02d0n\u0259]}} ; {{lang|de|Labyrinth}} {{IPA|[laby\u02c8\u0281\u026ant]}} or {{lang|de|Gymnasium}} {{IPA|/\u0261\u028fm\u02c8na\u02d0zi\u032f\u028am/}}), except in ''ay'' and ''ey'' which are both pronounced {{IPA|[a\u026a\u032f]}}. It is also often used in loanwords and pronounced like in the original language like in ''Style'' or ''Recycling''.\n* '''z''' is always pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|zog}} {{IPA|[t\u0361so\u02d0k]}}), except in loanwords. A '''tz''' indicates that the preceding vowel is short.\n\n==== Consonant shifts ====\n{{details|High German consonant shift}}\n\nGerman does not have any [[dental fricative]]s (as English '''th'''). The '''th''' sounds, which the English language still has, disappeared on the continent in German with the consonant shifts between the 8th and the 10th centuries.<ref>For a history of the German consonants see {{harvp|Cercignani|1979}}.</ref> It is sometimes possible to find parallels between English and German by replacing the English '''th''' with '''d''' in German: \"Thank\" \u2192 in German {{lang|de|Dank}}, \"this\" and \"that\" \u2192 {{lang|de|dies}} and {{lang|de|das}}, \"[[thou]]\" (old 2nd person singular pronoun) \u2192 {{lang|de|du}}, \"think\" \u2192 {{lang|de|denken}}, \"thirsty\" \u2192 {{lang|de|durstig}} and many other examples.\n\nLikewise, the '''gh''' in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] English words, pronounced in several different ways in modern English (as an '''f''', or not at all), can often be linked to German '''ch''': \"to laugh\" \u2192 {{lang|de|lachen}}, \"through\" \u2192 {{lang|de|durch}}, \"high\" \u2192 {{lang|de|hoch}}, \"naught\" \u2192 {{lang|de|nichts}}, \"light\" \u2192 {{lang|de|leicht}} or {{lang|de|Licht}}, \"sight\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Sicht}}, \"daughter\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Tochter}}, \"neighbour\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Nachbar}}.\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|German literature}}\n\nThe German language is used in German literature and can be traced back to the [[Middle Ages]], with the most notable authors of the period being [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]].\nThe {{lang|de|[[Nibelungenlied]]}}, whose author remains unknown, is also an important work of the epoch. The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.\n\nReformer and theologian [[Martin Luther]], who was the first to translate the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern \"High German\" language. Among the most well known poets and authors in German are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]], [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], and [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]. Thirteen German-speaking people have won the [[Nobel Prize in literature]]: [[Theodor Mommsen]], [[Rudolf Christoph Eucken]], [[Paul von Heyse]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Carl Spitteler]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Nelly Sachs]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll]], [[Elias Canetti]], [[G\u00fcnter Grass]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]] and [[Herta M\u00fcller]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"align:center;\"\n!

The unity of Proto-Greek would have ended as Hellenic migrants entered the [[Geography of Greece|Greek peninsula]] sometime in the [[Neolithic]] era or the [[Bronze Age]].<ref>A comprehensive overview in J.T.

It is recorded in the [[Linear B]] script on tablets dating from the 15th century BC onwards.\n* '''[[Ancient Greek]]''': in its various [[Ancient Greek dialects|dialects]], the language of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek civilisation]]. It was widely known throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. Ancient Greek fell into disuse in western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], but remained officially in use in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] world and was reintroduced to the rest of Europe with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and [[Greeks|Greek]] migration to western Europe.\n* '''[[Koine Greek]]''': The fusion of [[Ionian Greek|Ionian]] with [[Attic Greek|Attic]], the dialect of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], began the process that resulted in the creation of the first common Greek dialect, which became a [[lingua franca]] across the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and [[Near East]]. Koine Greek can be initially traced within the armies and conquered territories of [[Alexander the Great]] and after the Hellenistic colonisation of the known world, it was spoken from [[Egypt]] to the fringes of [[India]]. After the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] conquest of Greece, an unofficial [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] of Greek and [[Latin]] was established in the city of [[Rome]] and Koine Greek became a first or second language in the [[Roman Empire]]. The origin of [[Christianity]] can also be traced through Koine Greek, because the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] used this form of the language to spread Christianity. It is also known as '''Hellenistic Greek''', '''New Testament Greek''', and sometimes '''Biblical Greek''' because it was the original language of the [[New Testament]] and the [[Old Testament]] was translated into the same language via the [[Septuagint]].\n[[File:Anatolian Greek dialects.png|thumb|Distribution of varieties of Greek in [[Anatolia]], 1910.

''Medieval Greek'' is a cover phrase for a whole continuum of different speech and writing styles, ranging from vernacular continuations of spoken Koine that were already approaching [[Modern Greek]] in many respects, to highly learned forms imitating classical Attic. Much of the written Greek that was used as the official language of the Byzantine Empire was an eclectic middle-ground variety based on the tradition of written Koine.\n* '''[[Modern Greek]]''' (Neo-Hellenic):<ref name=\"Ethnologue\">[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ell Ethnologue]</ref> Stemming from Medieval Greek, Modern Greek usages can be traced in the Byzantine period, as early as the 11th century. It is the language used by the modern Greeks, and, apart from Standard Modern Greek, there are several [[Varieties of Modern Greek|dialects]] of it.\n\n===Diglossia===\n{{Main article|Greek language question}}\n\nIn the modern era, the Greek language entered a state of [[diglossia]]: the coexistence of vernacular and archaizing written forms of the language. What came to be known as the [[Greek language question]] was a polarization between two competing varieties of [[Modern Greek]]: [[Demotic Greek|Dimotiki]], the vernacular form of Modern Greek proper, and [[Katharevousa]], meaning 'purified', a compromise between Dimotiki and [[Ancient Greek]], which was developed in the early 19th century and was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed Greek state. In 1976, Dimotiki was declared the official language of Greece, having incorporated features of Katharevousa and giving birth to [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Standard Modern Greek|Standard Modern Greek]], which is used today for all official purposes and in education.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11134463|title=The modern Greek language : a descriptive analysis of standard modern Greek|last=Peter.|first=Mackridge,|date=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198157700|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire]|oclc=11134463}}</ref>\n\n===Historical unity===\n[[File:Modern Greek dialects en.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The distribution of major modern Greek dialect areas]]\n\nThe historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the Greek language is often emphasised. Although Greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages, never since classical antiquity has its cultural, literary, and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging. Greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient Greek as part of their own rather than a foreign language.<ref>{{harvnb|Browning|1983}}.</ref> It is also often stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages. According to one estimation, \"[[Homeric Greek]] is probably closer to [[Demotic Greek|demotic]] than 12-century [[Middle English]] is to [[Modern English|modern spoken English]],\"<ref>{{harvnb|Alexiou|1982|pp=156\u2013192}}.</ref> (Greek has seen fewer changes in 2700 years, than English has in 900 years).\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n{{Further information|Greeks|Greek diaspora}} \n[[File:A27 Motorway, Greece - Section Kozani-Ptolemaida - Kozani-North interchange (A2) - 02.jpg|thumb|Greek language road sign, A27 Motorway, Greece]]\n[[File:Greek USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Spread of Greek in the United States]]\n\nGreek is spoken by at least 13 million people, mainly in [[Greece]], [[Albania]] and [[Cyprus]], but also worldwide by the large [[Greek diaspora]].

The main phonological changes occurred during the Hellenistic and Roman period (see [[Koine Greek phonology]] for details):\n* replacement of the [[pitch accent]] with a [[stress (linguistics)|stress accent]].\n* simplification of the system of [[vowel]]s and [[diphthong]]s: loss of vowel length distinction, monophthongisation of most diphthongs and several steps in a [[chain shift]] of vowels towards /i/ ([[iotacism]]).\n* development of the [[voicelessness|voiceless]] [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] [[stop consonant|plosive]]s {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}} and {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} to the voiceless [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, respectively; the similar development of {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} to {{IPA|/x/}} may have taken place later (the phonological changes are not reflected in the orthography, and both earlier and later phonemes are written with [[Phi (letter)|\u03c6]], [[Theta|\u03b8]], and [[Chi (letter)|\u03c7]]).\n* development of the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] plosives {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} to their voiced fricative counterparts {{IPA|/\u03b2/}} (later /v/), {{IPA|/\u00f0/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0263/}}.\n\n===Morphology===\nIn all its stages, the morphology of Greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes, a limited but productive system of compounding<ref>{{harvnb|Ralli|2001|pp=164\u2013203}}.</ref> and a rich inflectional system. Although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time, morphological changes are present throughout, particularly in the nominal and verbal systems. The major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case (its functions being largely taken over by the genitive). The verbal system has lost the infinitive, the synthetically-formed future and perfect tenses and the optative mood. Many have been replaced by [[periphrastic]] (analytical) forms.\n\n====Nouns and adjectives====\nPronouns show distinctions in [[grammatical person|person]] (1st, 2nd, and 3rd), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular, dual, and plural in the ancient language; singular and plural alone in later stages), and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and decline for [[grammatical case|case]] (from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern language).<ref>The four cases that are found in all stages of Greek are the nominative, genitive, accusative and vocative. The dative/locative of Ancient Greek disappeared in the late Hellenistic period, and the instrumental case of Mycenaean Greek disappeared in the Archaic period.</ref> Nouns, articles and adjectives show all the distinctions except for person. Both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun.\n\n====Verbs====\nThe inflectional categories of the Greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language's history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression. Greek verbs have [[synthetic language|synthetic]] inflectional forms for:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Ancient Greek\n!Modern Greek\n|-\n!

Most Greek linguists advocate abandoning the traditional terminology (Anna Roussou and Tasos Tsangalidis 2009, in ''Meletes gia tin Elliniki Glossa'', Thessaloniki, Anastasia Giannakidou 2009 \"Temporal semantics and polarity: The dependency of the subjunctive revisited\", Lingua); see [[Modern Greek grammar#The verb|Modern Greek grammar]] for explanation.</ref> and imperative (other modal functions are expressed by periphrastic constructions)\n|-\n! Voice\n| [[active voice|active]], [[middle voice|middle]], and [[passive voice|passive]]\n| active and [[mediopassive voice|medio-passive]]\n|}\n\n===Syntax===\nMany aspects of the [[syntax]] of Greek have remained constant: verbs agree with their subject only, the use of the surviving cases is largely intact (nominative for subjects and predicates, accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions, genitive for possessors), articles precede nouns, adpositions are largely prepositional, relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial. However, the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax, and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the [[Modern Greek grammar|modern form of the language]]. Ancient Greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive, and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely (instead having a raft of new periphrastic constructions) and uses participles more restrictively. The loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects (and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well). Ancient Greek tended to be verb-final, but neutral word order in the modern language is VSO or SVO.\n\n===Vocabulary===\nModern Greek inherits most of its vocabulary from Ancient Greek, which in turn is an Indo-European language, but also includes a number of [[Pre-Greek substrate|borrowings]] from the languages of the populations that inhabited Greece before the arrival of Proto-Greeks,<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|2009}}.</ref> some documented in [[Linear B|Mycenaean texts]]; they include a large number of Greek [[toponym]]s. The form and meaning of many words has evolved. [[Loanword]]s (words of foreign origin) have entered the language, mainly from [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Venetian language#History|Venetian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. During the older periods of Greek, loanwords into Greek acquired Greek inflections, thus leaving only a foreign root word. Modern borrowings (from the 20th century on), especially from [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]], are typically not inflected; other modern borrowings are derived from [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and [[Eastern Romance languages]] ([[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]]).\n\n===Greek loanwords in other languages===\n{{details|Greek and Latin roots in English}}\n\nGreek words have been widely borrowed into other languages, including English: ''[[mathematics]]'', ''[[physics]]'', ''[[astronomy]]'', ''[[democracy]]'', ''[[philosophy]]'', ''[[:wikt:athletics|athletics]], [[theatre]], [[rhetoric]]'', ''[[baptism]]'', ''[[:wikt:evangelist|evangelist]]'', etc. Moreover, Greek words and [[morpheme|word elements]] continue to be productive as a basis for coinages: ''[[anthropology]]'', ''[[photography]]'', ''[[telephony]]'', ''[[isomer]]'', ''[[biomechanics]]'', ''[[cinematography]]'', etc. and form, with [[Scientific Latin|Latin words]], the [[International scientific vocabulary|foundation of international scientific and technical vocabulary]] like all words ending with ''\u2013logy'' (\"discourse\"). There are many [[English words of Greek origin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Scheler|1977}}.</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nGreek is an independent branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]].

It was created by modifying the [[Phoenician alphabet]], with the innovation of adopting certain letters to represent the [[vowel]]s. The variant of the alphabet in use today is essentially the late [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] variant, introduced for writing classical [[Attic Greek|Attic]] in 403 BC. In classical Greek, as in classical Latin, only upper-case letters existed. The lower-case Greek letters were developed much later by medieval scribes to permit a faster, more convenient cursive writing style with the use of [[ink]] and [[quill]].\n\nThe Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters, each with an uppercase ([[capital letter|majuscule]]) and lowercase ([[lower case|minuscule]]) form. The letter [[sigma]] has an additional lowercase form (\u03c2) used in the final position:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"33\" | [[upper case]]\n|-\n|[[Alpha|\u0391]]||[[Beta|\u0392]]||[[Gamma|\u0393]]||[[Delta (letter)|\u0394]]||[[Epsilon|\u0395]]||[[Zeta|\u0396]]||[[Eta|\u0397]]||[[Theta|\u0398]]||[[Iota|\u0399]]||[[Kappa|\u039a]]||[[Lambda|\u039b]]||[[Mu (letter)|\u039c]]||[[Nu (letter)|\u039d]]||[[Xi (letter)|\u039e]]||[[Omicron|\u039f]]||[[Pi (letter)|\u03a0]]||[[Rho|\u03a1]]||[[Sigma|\u03a3]]||[[Tau|\u03a4]]||[[Upsilon|\u03a5]]||[[Phi|\u03a6]]||[[Chi (letter)|\u03a7]]||[[Psi (letter)|\u03a8]]||[[Omega|\u03a9]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"33\" | [[lower case]]\n|-\n|\u03b1||\u03b2||\u03b3||\u03b4||\u03b5||\u03b6||\u03b7||\u03b8||\u03b9||\u03ba||\u03bb||\u03bc||\u03bd||\u03be||\u03bf||\u03c0||\u03c1||\u03c3<br>\u03c2||\u03c4||\u03c5||\u03c6||\u03c7||\u03c8||\u03c9\n|}\n\n====Diacritics====\n{{main article|Greek diacritics}}\n\nIn addition to the letters, the Greek alphabet features a number of [[diacritic|diacritical signs]]: three different accent marks ([[acute accent|acute]], [[grave accent|grave]], and [[circumflex]]), originally denoting different shapes of [[pitch accent]] on the stressed vowel; the so-called breathing marks ([[rough breathing|rough]] and [[smooth breathing]]), originally used to signal presence or absence of word-initial /h/; and the [[trema (diacritic)|diaeresis]], used to mark full syllabic value of a vowel that would otherwise be read as part of a diphthong. These marks were introduced during the course of the Hellenistic period. Actual usage of the grave in [[penmanship|handwriting]] saw a rapid decline in favor of uniform usage of the acute during the late 20th century, and it has only been retained in [[typography]].\n\nAfter the writing reform of 1982, most diacritics are no longer used. Since then, Greek has been written mostly in the simplified [[Greek diacritics|monotonic orthography]] (or monotonic system), which employs only the acute accent and the diaeresis. The traditional system, now called the polytonic orthography (or polytonic system), is still used internationally for the writing of [[Ancient Greek]].\n\n====Punctuation====\nIn Greek, the question mark is written as the English semicolon, while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point (\u2022), known as the ''[[Interpunct#Ano teleia|ano teleia]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1}}).

In the [[Talmud]] (Tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 38b), [[Adam]] was initially created as a golem (\u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd) when his dust was \"kneaded into a shapeless husk.\" Like Adam, all golems are [[creation of man from clay|created from mud]] by those close to divinity, but no anthropogenic golem is fully human. Early on, the main disability of the golem was its inability to speak. [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 65b describes [[Rava (amora)|Rava]] creating a man (''gavra''). He sent the man to [[Rav Zeira]]. Rav Zeira spoke to him, but he did not answer. Rav Zeira said, \"You were created by the sages; return to your dust\".\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], passages from the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'' (''Book of Creation'') were studied as a means to create and animate a golem, although there is little in the writings of Jewish mysticism that supports this belief. It was believed that golems could be activated by an [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] experience induced by the ritualistic use of various letters of the Hebrew Alphabet<ref name=idel/> forming a \"''[[Shemhamphorasch|shem]]''\" (any one of the [[Names of God in Judaism|Names of God]]), wherein the ''shem'' was written on a piece of paper and inserted in the mouth or in the forehead of the golem.<ref name=jewishencyclopedia/>\n\nA golem is inscribed with Hebrew words in some tales (for example, some versions of Che\u0142m and Prague, as well as in Polish tales and versions of [[Brothers Grimm]]), such as the word ''emet'' (\u05d0\u05de\u05ea, \"truth\" in Hebrew) written on its forehead. The golem could then be deactivated by removing the aleph (\u05d0) in ''emet'',<ref>Kerstein, Benjamin.  ''Jewish Ideas Daily''.  14 September 2010.  24 August 2017.</ref> thus changing the inscription from \"truth\" to \"death\" (''met'' \u05de\u05ea, meaning \"dead\").  Rabbi Jacob ben Shalom arrived at [[Barcelona]] from Germany in 1325 and remarked that the law of destruction is the reversal of the law of creation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trachtenberg|first=Joshua|title=Jewish Magic and Superstition|location=Philadelphia|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|year=2004|origyear=Originally published 1939|isbn=9780812218626|page=86}}</ref>\n\nOne source credits 11th century Jew [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] with creating a golem,<ref>Bokser, Ben Zion (2006).

Eliyahu Ba'al Shem of blessed memory. When the Gaon saw that the Golem was growing larger and larger, he feared that the Golem would destroy the universe.

His parents could not afford to send him to a university without another scholarship, and they concluded from his poor results that he would not be able to win one. Runciman noted that he had a romantic idea about the [[Eastern world|East]],<ref name=Wadhams>{{Cite journal |first=Stephen |last=Wadhams |title=Remembering Orwell |publisher=Penguin |year=1984}}</ref> and the family decided that Blair should join the [[Imperial Police]], the precursor of the Indian Police Service. For this he had to pass an entrance examination.

In October 1922 he sailed on board SS ''Herefordshire'' via the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Ceylon]] to join the [[Indian Imperial Police]] in Burma. A month later, he arrived at [[Rangoon]] and travelled to the police training school in [[Mandalay]]. He was appointed an Assistant District Superintendent on 29 November 1922.<ref>{{cite book|pages=514|title=The India Office and Burma Office List: 1927|first= |last=|publisher=Harrison & Sons, Ltd.|year=1927|isbn=|subject=}}</ref> After a short posting at [[Maymyo]], Burma's principal [[hill station]], he was posted to the frontier outpost of [[Myaungmya]] in the [[Irrawaddy Delta]] at the beginning of 1924.\n\nWorking as an imperial police officer gave him considerable responsibility while most of his contemporaries were still at university in England. When he was posted farther east in the Delta to [[Twante]] as a sub-divisional officer, he was responsible for the security of some 200,000 people. At the end of 1924, he was posted to [[Syriam]], closer to Rangoon. Syriam had the refinery of the [[Burmah Oil Company]], \"the surrounding land a barren waste, all vegetation killed off by the fumes of [[sulphur dioxide]] pouring out day and night from the stacks of the refinery.\" But the town was near Rangoon, a cosmopolitan seaport, and Blair went into the city as often as he could, \"to browse in a bookshop; to eat well-cooked food; to get away from the boring routine of police life\".<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''The Unknown Orwell'', pp. 170\u201371</ref> In September 1925 he went to [[Insein Township|Insein]], the home of [[Insein Prison]], the second largest prison in Burma. In Insein, he had \"long talks on every conceivable subject\" with Elisa Maria Langford-Rae (who later married [[Kazi Lhendup Dorjee]]). She noted his \"sense of utter fairness in minutest details\".<ref name=Shelden>Michael Shelden ''Orwell: The Authorised Biography'', William Heinemann, 1991</ref>\n\n[[File:KatharBritishClub.JPG|left|thumb|British Club in [[Katha, Myanmar|Katha]] ]]\nIn Burma, Blair acquired a reputation as an outsider. He spent much of his time alone, reading or pursuing non-''[[Pukka sahib|pukka]]'' activities, such as attending the churches of the [[Karen people|Karen]] ethnic group. A colleague, Roger Beadon, recalled (in a 1969 recording for the BBC) that Blair was fast to learn the language and that before he left Burma, \"was able to speak fluently with Burmese priests in 'very high-flown Burmese.'\"<ref>''A Kind of Compulsion, 1903\u201336'', p. 87</ref> Blair made changes to his appearance in Burma that remained for the rest of his life. \"While in Burma, he acquired a moustache similar to those worn by officers of the British regiments stationed there.{{Clarify|date=April 2018|Reason=Was this the toothbrush style in the passport photo on this page, or the upper-lip style in later photos?}} [He] also acquired some tattoos; on each knuckle he had a small untidy blue circle.

At the end of that year, he was assigned to [[Kathar|Katha]] in [[Upper Burma]], where he contracted [[dengue fever]] in 1927. Entitled to a [[leave (military)|leave]] in England that year, he was allowed to return in July due to his illness. While on leave in England and on holiday with his family in [[Cornwall]] in September 1927, he reappraised his life. Deciding against returning to Burma, he resigned from the Indian Imperial Police to become a writer, with effect from 12 March 1928 after five-and-a-half years of service.<ref>{{cite book|pages=894|title=The India Office and Burma Office List: 1929|first= |last=|publisher=Harrison & Sons, Ltd.|year=1929|isbn=|subject=}}</ref> He drew on his experiences in the Burma police for the novel ''[[Burmese Days]]'' (1934) and the essays \"[[A Hanging]]\" (1931) and \"[[Shooting an Elephant]]\" (1936).\n\n===London and Paris===\n[[File:Portobello Road - George Orwell House.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Blair's 1927 lodgings in [[Portobello Road]], London]]\n\nIn England, he settled back in the family home at [[Southwold]], renewing acquaintance with local friends and attending an [[Old Etonian]] dinner.

In fact he decided to write of \"certain aspects of the present that he set out to know\" and \"ventured into the [[East End of London]]&nbsp;\u2013 the first of the occasional sorties he would make to discover for himself the world of poverty and the down-and-outers who inhabit it. He had found a subject. These sorties, explorations, expeditions, tours or immersions were made intermittently over a period of five years.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''The Unknown Orwell'', p. 204</ref>\n\nIn imitation of [[Jack London]], whose writing he admired (particularly ''[[The People of the Abyss]]''), Blair started to explore the poorer parts of London. On his first outing he set out to [[Limehouse Causeway]], spending his first night in a common lodging house, possibly George Levy's 'kip'. For a while he \"went native\" in his own country, dressing like a [[tramp]], adopting the name P.S. Burton and making no concessions to middle-class ''[[etiquette|mores]]'' and expectations; he recorded his experiences of the low life for use in \"[[The Spike (essay)|The Spike]]\", his first published essay in English, and in the second half of his first book, ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'' (1933).\n[[File:Rue du Pot-de-Fer.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Rue du Pot de Fer on the [[Rive Gauche (Paris)|Left Bank]] in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]], where Blair lived in Paris]]\n\nIn early 1928 he moved to Paris. He lived in the rue du Pot de Fer, a working class district in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th Arrondissement]].<ref name=Taylor/> His aunt Nellie Limouzin also lived in Paris and gave him social and, when necessary, financial support. He began to write novels, including an early version of ''Burmese Days'', but nothing else survives from that period.<ref name=Taylor/> He was more successful as a journalist and published articles in ''[[Monde (review)|Monde]]'', a political/literary journal edited by [[Henri Barbusse]] (his first article as a professional writer, \"La Censure en Angleterre\", appeared in that journal on 6 October 1928); ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]'', where his first article to appear in England, \"A Farthing Newspaper\", was printed on 29 December 1928;<ref>''A Kind of Compulsion'' (1903\u201336), p. 113</ref> and ''Le Progr\u00e8s Civique'' (founded by the left-wing coalition [[Cartel des Gauches|Le Cartel des Gauches]]). Three pieces appeared in successive weeks in ''Le Progr\u00e8s Civique'': discussing unemployment, a day in the life of a tramp, and the beggars of London, respectively. \"In one or another of its destructive forms, poverty was to become his obsessive subject&nbsp;\u2013 at the heart of almost everything he wrote until ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''The Unknown Orwell'', p. 216</ref>\n\nHe fell seriously ill in February 1929 and was taken to the [[H\u00f4pital Cochin]] in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris|14th arrondissement]], a free hospital where medical students were trained. His experiences there were the basis of his essay \"[[How the Poor Die]]\", published in 1946. He chose not to identify the hospital, and indeed was deliberately misleading about its location. Shortly afterwards, he had all his money stolen from his lodging house. Whether through necessity or to collect material, he undertook menial jobs such as dishwashing in a fashionable hotel on the [[rue de Rivoli]], which he later described in ''Down and Out in Paris and London''. In August 1929, he sent a copy of \"[[The Spike (essay)|The Spike]]\" to [[John Middleton Murry]]'s ''[[Adelphi (magazine)|New Adelphi]]'' magazine in London. The magazine was edited by [[Max Plowman]] and [[Sir Richard Rees, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Rees]], and Plowman accepted the work for publication.\n\n===Southwold===\n[[File:Southwold North Parade.jpg|right|thumb|[[Southwold]]&nbsp;\u2013 North Parade]]\n\nIn December 1929, after nearly two years in Paris, Blair returned to England and went directly to his parents' house in [[Southwold]], a coastal town in [[Suffolk]], which remained his base for the next five years. The family was well established in the town, and his sister Avril was running a tea-house there. He became acquainted with many local people, including Brenda Salkeld, the clergyman's daughter who worked as a gym-teacher at [[Saint Felix School|St Felix Girls' School]] in the town. Although Salkeld rejected his offer of marriage, she remained a friend and regular correspondent for many years. He also renewed friendships with older friends, such as Dennis Collings, whose girlfriend Eleanor Jacques was also to play a part in his life.<ref name=Taylor/>\n\nIn early 1930 he stayed briefly in [[Bramley, Leeds]], with his sister Marjorie and her husband Humphrey Dakin, who was as unappreciative of Blair as when they knew each other as children. Blair was writing reviews for ''Adelphi'' and acting as a private tutor to a disabled child at Southwold. He then became tutor to three young brothers, one of whom, [[Richard Stanley Peters|Richard Peters]], later became a distinguished academic.<ref>R.S. Peters (1974). ''A Boy's View of George Orwell'' Psychology and Ethical Development. Allen & Unwin</ref> \"His history in these years is marked by dualities and contrasts. There is Blair leading a respectable, outwardly eventless life at his parents' house in Southwold, writing; then in contrast, there is Blair as Burton (the name he used in his down-and-out episodes) in search of experience in the kips and spikes, in the East End, on the road, and in the hop fields of Kent.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, p. 230 ''The Unknown Orwell''</ref> He went painting and bathing on the beach, and there he met Mabel and Francis Fierz, who later influenced his career. Over the next year he visited them in London, often meeting their friend Max Plowman. He also often stayed at the homes of Ruth Pitter and Richard Rees, where he could \"change\" for his sporadic tramping expeditions. One of his jobs was domestic work at a lodgings for [[half crown (British coin)|half a crown]] (two shillings and sixpence, or one-eighth of a pound) a day.<ref name=\"autogenerated1996\">Stella Judt \"I once met George Orwell\" in ''I once Met'' 1996</ref>\n\nBlair now contributed regularly to ''Adelphi'', with \"[[A Hanging]]\" appearing in August 1931. From August to September 1931 his explorations of poverty continued, and, like the protagonist of ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'', he followed the [[East End]] tradition of working in the Kent [[Hops|hop]] fields. He kept a diary about his experiences there. Afterwards, he lodged in the [[Tooley Street#George Orwell|Tooley Street kip]], but could not stand it for long, and with financial help from his parents moved to Windsor Street, where he stayed until Christmas. \"Hop Picking\", by Eric Blair, appeared in the October 1931 issue of ''[[New Statesman]]'', whose editorial staff included his old friend Cyril Connolly. Mabel Fierz put him in contact with [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], who became his [[literary agent]].\n\nAt this time [[Jonathan Cape]] rejected ''A Scullion's Diary'', the first version of ''Down and Out''. On the advice of Richard Rees, he offered it to [[Faber and Faber]], but their editorial director, [[T. S. Eliot]], also rejected it. Blair ended the year by deliberately getting himself arrested,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1214/041214-orwell-court-record|title=Discovery of 'drunk and incapable' arrest record shows Orwell's 'honesty'|work=ucl.ac.uk|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=2014-12-04}}</ref> so that he could experience Christmas in prison, but the authorities did not regard his \"drunk and disorderly\" behaviour as imprisonable, and he returned home to Southwold after two days in a police cell.\n\n===Teaching career===\n<!-- Courtesy note: [[P. S. Burton]] links here. as {{R to section}} -->\nIn April 1932 Blair became a teacher at The Hawthorns High School, a school for boys in [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]], West London. This was a small school offering private schooling for children of local tradesmen and shopkeepers, and had only 14 or 16 boys aged between ten and sixteen, and one other master.<ref>Crick (1982), p. 221</ref> While at the school he became friendly with the curate of the local parish church and became involved with activities there. Mabel Fierz had pursued matters with Moore, and at the end of June 1932, Moore told Blair that [[Victor Gollancz]] was prepared to publish ''A Scullion's Diary'' for a \u00a340 advance, through his recently founded publishing house, [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]], which was an outlet for radical and socialist works.\n\nAt the end of the summer term in 1932, Blair returned to Southwold, where his parents had used a legacy to buy their own home. Blair and his sister Avril spent the holidays making the house habitable while he also worked on ''Burmese Days''.<ref>Avril Dunn ''My Brother George Orwell'' Twentieth Century 1961</ref> He was also spending time with Eleanor Jacques, but her attachment to Dennis Collings remained an obstacle to his hopes of a more serious relationship.[[File:River Orwell Shore - geograph.org.uk - 1044570.jpg|thumb|The pen name George Orwell was inspired by the [[River Orwell]] in the English county of Suffolk<ref>Voorhees (1986: 11)</ref> ]]\n\"Clink\", an essay describing his failed attempt to get sent to prison, appeared in the August 1932 number of ''Adelphi''. He returned to teaching at Hayes and prepared for the publication of his book, now known as ''Down and Out in Paris and London''. He wished to publish under a different name to avoid any embarrassment to his family over his time as a \"tramp\".<ref name=\"nybooks\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/may/26/intimate-orwell/?pagination=false |title=The Intimate Orwell |last=Leys |first=Simon |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2011 |publisher=[[The New York Review of Books]]}}</ref> In a letter to Moore (dated 15 November 1932), he left the choice of pseudonym to Moore and to Gollancz. Four days later, he wrote to Moore, suggesting the pseudonyms ''P.S. Burton'' (a name he used when tramping), ''Kenneth Miles'', ''George Orwell'', and ''H. Lewis Allways''.<ref>Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.)''Orwell: An Age Like This'', letters 31 and 33 (New York: Harcourt, Brace & World)</ref> He finally adopted the ''[[nom de plume]]'' George Orwell because \"It is a good round English name.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=George Orwell: from Animal Farm to Zog, an A\u2013Z of Orwell|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/5386673/George-Orwell-from-Animal-Farm-to-Zog-an-A-Z-of-Orwell.html|agency=The Telegraph|date=20 March 2018}}</ref> ''Down and Out in Paris and London'' was published on 9 January 1933 as Orwell continued to work on ''Burmese Days''. ''Down and Out'' was modestly successful and was next published by [[Harper (publisher)|Harper & Brothers]] in New York.\n\nIn mid-1933 Blair left Hawthorns to become a teacher at [[Frays River|Frays College]], in [[Uxbridge]], [[Middlesex]]. This was a much larger establishment with 200 pupils and a full complement of staff. He acquired a motorcycle and took trips through the surrounding countryside. On one of these expeditions he became soaked and caught a chill that developed into pneumonia. He was taken to Uxbridge Cottage Hospital, where for a time his life was believed to be in danger. When he was discharged in January 1934, he returned to Southwold to convalesce and, supported by his parents, never returned to teaching.\n\nHe was disappointed when Gollancz turned down ''Burmese Days'', mainly on the grounds of potential suits for libel, but Harper were prepared to publish it in the United States. Meanwhile, Blair started work on the novel ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'', drawing upon his life as a teacher and on life in Southwold. Eleanor Jacques was now married and had gone to Singapore and Brenda Salkield had left for Ireland, so Blair was relatively isolated in Southwold \u2013 working on the [[allotment (gardening)|allotments]], walking alone and spending time with his father. Eventually in October, after sending ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' to Moore, he left for London to take a job that had been found for him by his aunt Nellie Limouzin.\n\n===Hampstead===\n[[File:orwell hampstead home.JPG|thumb|Orwell's former home at 77 Parliament Hill, [[Hampstead]], London]]\n\nThis job was as a part-time assistant in Booklovers' Corner, a second-hand bookshop in Hampstead run by Francis and Myfanwy Westrope, who were friends of Nellie Limouzin in the [[Esperanto]] movement. The Westropes were friendly and provided him with comfortable accommodation at Warwick Mansions, Pond Street. He was sharing the job with [[Jon Kimche]], who also lived with the Westropes. Blair worked at the shop in the afternoons and had his mornings free to write and his evenings free to socialise. These experiences provided background for the novel ''[[Keep the Aspidistra Flying]]'' (1936). As well as the various guests of the Westropes, he was able to enjoy the company of Richard Rees and the ''Adelphi'' writers and Mabel Fierz. The Westropes and Kimche were members of the [[Independent Labour Party]], although at this time Blair was not seriously politically active. He was writing for the ''Adelphi'' and preparing ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' and ''Burmese Days'' for publication.\n\nAt the beginning of 1935 he had to move out of Warwick Mansions, and Mabel Fierz found him a flat in Parliament Hill. ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' was published on 11 March 1935. In early 1935 Blair met his future wife [[Eileen O'Shaughnessy]], when his landlady, Rosalind Obermeyer, who was studying for a master's degree in psychology at [[University College London]], invited some of her fellow students to a party. One of these students, Elizaveta Fen, a biographer and future translator of [[Chekhov]], recalled Blair and his friend [[Richard Rees]] \"draped\" at the fireplace, looking, she thought, \"moth-eaten and prematurely aged.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''Orwell:The Transformation'' pp.&nbsp;100\u201301</ref> Around this time, Blair had started to write reviews for ''[[The New English Weekly]]''.\n[[File:George Orwell in Hampstead - geograph.org.uk - 432863.jpg|alt=|thumb|Orwell's time as a bookseller is commemorated with this plaque in Hampstead]]\n\nIn June, ''Burmese Days'' was published and Cyril Connolly's review in the ''New Statesman'' prompted Blair (as he then became known) to re-establish contact with his old friend. In August, he moved into a flat in [[Kentish Town]], which he shared with Michael Sayers and [[Rayner Heppenstall]]. The relationship was sometimes awkward and Blair and Heppenstall even came to blows, though they remained friends and later worked together on BBC broadcasts.<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 392</ref> Blair was now working on ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying'', and also tried unsuccessfully to write a serial for the ''[[News Chronicle]]''. By October 1935 his flatmates had moved out and he was struggling to pay the rent on his own. He remained until the end of January 1936, when he stopped working at Booklovers' Corner.\n\n===''The Road to Wigan Pier''===\n{{main|The Road to Wigan Pier}}\nAt this time, Victor Gollancz suggested Orwell spend a short time investigating social conditions in economically depressed [[northern England]].{{refn|The conventional view, based on Geoffrey Gorer's recollections, is of a specific commission with a \u00a3500 advance. Taylor argues that Orwell's subsequent life does not suggest he received such a large advance, Gollancz was not known to pay large sums to relatively unknown authors, and Gollancz took little proprietorial interest in progress.<ref>D. J. Taylor ''Orwell: The Life'' Chatto & Windus 2003</ref>|group= n}} Two years earlier, [[J. B. Priestley]] had written about England north of the [[River Trent|Trent]], sparking an interest in reportage. The depression had also introduced a number of working-class writers from the North of England to the reading public. It was one of these working-class authors, [[Jack Hilton (author)|Jack Hilton]], whom Orwell sought for advice. Orwell had written to Hilton seeking lodging and asking for recommendations on his route. Hilton was unable to provide him lodging, but suggested that he travel to [[Wigan]] rather than Rochdale, \"for there are the colliers and they\u2019re good stuff.\"<ref>Clarke, Ben. \u201cGeorge Orwell, Jack Hilton, and the Working Class.\u201d ''Review of English Studies'' 67.281 (2016) 764-785.</ref>\n\nOn 31 January 1936, Orwell set out by public transport and on foot, reaching [[Manchester]] via [[Coventry]], Stafford, the [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]] and [[Macclesfield]]. Arriving in Manchester after the banks had closed, he had to stay in a common lodging-house. The next day he picked up a list of contacts sent by Richard Rees. One of these, the trade union official Frank Meade, suggested [[Wigan]], where Orwell spent February staying in dirty lodgings over a [[tripe]] shop. At Wigan, he visited many homes to see how people lived, took detailed notes of housing conditions and wages earned, went down [[Bryn Hall Colliery|Bryn Hall coal mine]], and used the [[Museum of Wigan Life|local public library]] to consult public health records and reports on working conditions in mines.\n\nDuring this time, he was distracted by concerns about style and possible libel in ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying''. He made a quick visit to [[Liverpool]] and during March, stayed in south Yorkshire, spending time in [[Sheffield]] and [[Barnsley]]. As well as visiting mines, including [[Grimethorpe]], and observing social conditions, he attended meetings of the Communist Party and of [[Oswald Mosley]]\u2014\"his speech the usual claptrap \u2013 The blame for everything was put upon mysterious international gangs of Jews\"\u2014where he saw the tactics of the [[British Union of Fascists|Blackshirts]]\u2014\"one is liable to get both a hammering and a fine for asking a question which Mosley finds it difficult to answer.\"<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 457</ref> He also made visits to his sister at [[Headingley]], during which he visited the [[Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum|Bront\u00eb Parsonage]] at [[Haworth]], where he was \"chiefly impressed by a pair of [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s cloth-topped boots, very small, with square toes and lacing up at the sides.\"<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 450.

The first half of the book documents his social investigations of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], including an evocative description of working life in the coal mines. The second half is a long essay on his upbringing and the development of his political conscience, which includes an argument for socialism (although he goes to lengths to balance the concerns and goals of socialism with the barriers it faced from the movement's own advocates at the time, such as \"priggish\" and \"dull\" socialist intellectuals and \"proletarian\" socialists with little grasp of the actual ideology). Gollancz feared the second half would offend readers and added a disculpatory preface to the book while Orwell was in Spain.\n\nOrwell needed somewhere he could concentrate on writing his book, and once again help was provided by Aunt Nellie, who was living at [[Wallington, Hertfordshire]] in a very small 16th-century cottage called the \"Stores\". Wallington was a tiny village 35 miles north of London, and the cottage had almost no modern facilities. Orwell took over the tenancy and moved in on 2 April 1936.<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 468</ref> He started work on ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' by the end of April, but also spent hours working on the garden and testing the possibility of reopening the Stores as a village shop. ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying'' was published by Gollancz on 20 April 1936. On 4 August, Orwell gave a talk at the Adelphi Summer School held at [[Langham, Essex|Langham]], entitled ''An Outsider Sees the Distressed Areas''; others who spoke at the school included [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]], [[Max Plowman]], [[Karl Polanyi]] and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]].\n\nOrwell's research for ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' led to him being placed under surveillance by the [[Special Branch]] from 1936, for 12 years, until one year before the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.<ref>\"Freedom of Information, National Archives\" http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2005/highlights_july/july19/default.htm)</ref>\n\nOrwell married [[Eileen O'Shaughnessy]] on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards, the political crisis began in Spain and Orwell followed developments there closely. At the end of the year, concerned by [[Francisco Franco]]'s military uprising, (supported by [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italy under fascism|Fascist Italy]] and local groups such as [[Falange]]), Orwell decided to go to Spain to take part in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on [[Second Spanish Republic|the Republican side]]. Under the erroneous impression that he needed papers from some left-wing organisation to cross the frontier, on [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]'s recommendation he applied unsuccessfully to [[Harry Pollitt]], leader of the [[British Communist Party]].

The American writer told Orwell that going to fight in the Civil War out of some sense of obligation or guilt was \"sheer stupidity\" and that the Englishman's ideas \"about combating Fascism, defending democracy, etc., etc., were all baloney.\"<ref>Haycock, ''I Am Spain'' (2013), 152</ref> A few days later in [[Barcelona]], Orwell met John McNair of the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) Office who quoted him: \"I've come to fight against Fascism\".<ref>John McNair \u2013 Interview with Ian Angus UCL 1964</ref> Orwell stepped into a complex political situation in [[Catalonia]]. The [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican government]] was supported by a number of factions with conflicting aims, including the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification]] (POUM&nbsp;\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista), the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and the [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]] (a wing of the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Spanish Communist Party]], which was backed by Soviet arms and aid). The ILP was linked to the POUM so Orwell joined the POUM.\n\nAfter a time at the Lenin Barracks in Barcelona he was sent to the relatively quiet [[Aragon]] Front under [[Georges Kopp]]. By January 1937 he was at [[Alcubierre]] {{convert|1500|ft|m}} above sea level, in the depth of winter. There was very little military action and Orwell was shocked by the lack of munitions, food and firewood as well as other extreme deprivations.<ref>See article by [[Iain King]] on Orwell's war experiences, [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-george-orwell.htm here.]</ref> With his Cadet Corps and police training, Orwell was quickly made a corporal. On the arrival of a British [[ILP Contingent]] about three weeks later, Orwell and the other English militiaman, Williams, were sent with them to Monte Oscuro. The newly arrived ILP contingent included Bob Smillie, [[Robert Edwards (politician)|Bob Edwards]], Stafford Cottman and Jack Branthwaite. The unit was then sent on to [[Huesca]].\n\nMeanwhile, back in England, Eileen had been handling the issues relating to the publication of ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' before setting out for Spain herself, leaving Nellie Limouzin to look after The Stores. Eileen volunteered for a post in John McNair's office and with the help of Georges Kopp paid visits to her husband, bringing him English tea, chocolate and cigars.<ref>Letter to Eileen Blair April 1937 in ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1&nbsp;\u2013 An Age Like This 1945\u20131950'' p. 296 (Penguin)</ref> Orwell had to spend some days in hospital with a poisoned hand<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|last1=Hicks|first1=Granville|title=George Orwell's Prelude in Spain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/16/specials/orwell-homage.html|website=New York Times|date=18 May 1952}}</ref> and had most of his possessions stolen by the staff. He returned to the front and saw some action in a night attack on the Nationalist trenches where he chased an enemy soldier with a bayonet and bombed an enemy rifle position.\n\nIn April, Orwell returned to Barcelona.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Wanting to be sent to the Madrid front, which meant he \"must join the International Column\", he approached a Communist friend attached to the Spanish Medical Aid and explained his case. \"Although he did not think much of the Communists, Orwell was still ready to treat them as friends and allies. That would soon change.\"<ref>Bowker, p. 216</ref> This was the time of the [[Barcelona May Days]] and Orwell was caught up in the factional fighting. He spent much of the time on a roof, with a stack of novels, but encountered [[Jon Kimche]] from his Hampstead days during the stay. The subsequent campaign of lies and distortion carried out by the Communist press,<ref>\"The accusation of espionage against the P.O.U.M. rested solely upon articles in the Communist press and the activities of the Communist-controlled secret police.\" ''Homage to Catalonia'' p. 168. Penguin, 1980</ref> in which the POUM was accused of collaborating with the fascists, had a dramatic effect on Orwell. Instead of joining the International Brigades as he had intended, he decided to return to the Aragon Front. Once the May fighting was over, he was approached by a Communist friend who asked if he still intended transferring to the International Brigades. Orwell expressed surprise that they should still want him, because according to the Communist press he was a fascist.<ref name=\"newsinger\">{{cite web|url=http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj62/newsinger.htm |title=Newsinger, John \"Orwell and the Spanish Revolution\" ''International Socialism Journal'' Issue 62 Spring 1994 |publisher=Pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk |accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref> \"No one who was in Barcelona then, or for months later, will forget the horrible atmosphere produced by fear, suspicion, hatred, censored newspapers, crammed jails, enormous food queues and prowling gangs of armed men.\"<ref>Bowker, quoting Orwell in Homage To Catalonia, p. 219</ref>\n\nAfter his return to the front, he was wounded in the throat by a sniper's bullet.

Unable to speak, and with blood pouring from his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to [[Si\u00e9tamo]], loaded on an ambulance and after a bumpy journey via [[Barbastro]] arrived at the hospital at [[L\u00e9rida]]. He recovered sufficiently to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to [[Tarragona]] and two days later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed his main artery by the barest margin and his voice was barely audible. It had been such a clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of [[cauterisation]]. He received [[electrotherapy]] treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.<ref>Taylor (2003: 228\u201329))</ref>\n\nBy the middle of June the political situation in Barcelona had deteriorated and the POUM\u2014painted by the pro-Soviet Communists as a [[Trotskyist]] organisation\u2014was outlawed and under attack. The Communist line was that the POUM were \"objectively\" Fascist, hindering the Republican cause. \"A particularly nasty poster appeared, showing a head with a POUM mask being ripped off to reveal a Swastika-covered face beneath.\"<ref>Gordon Bowker, Orwell, p. 218 {{ISBN|978-0349115511}}</ref> Members, including Kopp, were arrested and others were in hiding.

In the first week of July 1937 Orwell arrived back at Wallington; on 13 July 1937 a deposition was presented to the ''Tribunal for Espionage & High Treason'', [[Valencia]], charging the Orwells with \"rabid [[Trotskyism]]\", and being agents of the [[POUM]].<ref>Facing Unpleasant Facts, p. xxix, Secker & Warburg, 2000</ref> The trial of the leaders of the POUM and of Orwell (in his absence) took place in Barcelona in October and November 1938.

He found his views on the Spanish Civil War out of favour. [[Kingsley Martin]] rejected two of his works and Gollancz was equally cautious. At the same time, the communist ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Daily Worker]]'' was running an attack on ''The Road to Wigan Pier'', taking out of context Orwell writing that \"the working classes smell\"; a letter to Gollancz from Orwell threatening libel action brought a stop to this. Orwell was also able to find a more sympathetic publisher for his views in [[Fredric Warburg]] of Secker & Warburg. Orwell returned to Wallington, which he found in disarray after his absence. He acquired goats, a rooster he called Henry Ford and a poodle puppy he called Marx;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-piece-of-puzzle.htm |title=Another piece of the puzzle&nbsp;\u2013 Charles' George Orwell Links |publisher=Netcharles.com |accessdate=21 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619094314/http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-piece-of-puzzle.htm |archivedate=19 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralumun.com/bioorwell.htm |title=George Orwell Biography |publisher=Paralumun.com |accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/16-8-40/ |title=The Orwell Prize |publisher=Orwelldiaries.wordpress.com |date=16 August 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref> and settled down to animal husbandry and writing ''Homage to Catalonia''.\n\nThere were thoughts of going to India to work on the [[The Pioneer (newspaper)|Pioneer]], a newspaper in [[Lucknow]], but by March 1938 Orwell's health had deteriorated. He was admitted to [[Preston Hall, Aylesford|Preston Hall Sanatorium]] at [[Aylesford]], Kent, a [[British Legion]] hospital for ex-servicemen to which his brother-in-law Laurence O'Shaughnessy was attached. He was thought initially to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and stayed in the sanatorium until September. A stream of visitors came to see him, including Common, Heppenstall, Plowman and Cyril Connolly. Connolly brought with him [[Stephen Spender]], a cause of some embarrassment as Orwell had referred to Spender as a \"pansy friend\" some time earlier. ''Homage to Catalonia'' was published by Secker & Warburg and was a commercial flop. In the latter part of his stay at the clinic, Orwell was able to go for walks in the countryside and study nature.\n\nThe novelist [[Leo Myers|L. H. Myers]] secretly funded a trip to [[French Morocco]] for half a year for Orwell to avoid the English winter and recover his health. The Orwells set out in September 1938 via [[Gibraltar]] and [[Tangier]] to avoid [[Spanish Morocco]] and arrived at [[Marrakech]]. They rented a villa on the road to [[Casablanca]] and during that time Orwell wrote ''[[Coming Up for Air]]''. They arrived back in England on 30 March 1939 and ''Coming Up for Air'' was published in June. Orwell spent time in Wallington and Southwold working on a [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] essay and it was in July 1939 that Orwell's father, Richard Blair, died.\n\n===Second World War and ''Animal Farm''===\n\n[[File:George Orwell, c. 1940.jpg|alt=Orwell smiling|thumb|upright|left|A hand-coloured photo of Orwell, c. 1940]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Orwell's wife Eileen started working in the Censorship Department of the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in central London, staying during the week with her family in [[Greenwich]]. Orwell also submitted his name to the Central Register for war work, but nothing transpired. \"They won't have me in the army, at any rate at present, because of my lungs\", Orwell told Geoffrey Gorer. He returned to Wallington, and in late 1939 he wrote material for his first collection of essays, ''[[Inside the Whale and Other Essays|Inside the Whale]]''. For the next year he was occupied writing reviews for plays, films and books for ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'' and ''New Adelphi''. On 29 March 1940 his long association with ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' began<ref>''A Patriot After All, 1940\u201341'', p. xvii 1998 Secker & Warburg</ref> with a review of a sergeant's account of [[Napoleon]]'s [[French invasion of Russia|retreat from Moscow]]. At the beginning of 1940, the first edition of Connolly's ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' appeared, and this provided a new outlet for Orwell's work as well as new literary contacts. In May the Orwells took lease of a flat in London at Dorset Chambers, Chagford Street, [[Marylebone]]. It was the time of the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and the death in France of Eileen's brother Lawrence caused her considerable grief and long-term depression. Throughout this period Orwell kept a wartime diary.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Churchwell |first1=Sarah |title=Diaries |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/09/domestic-diaries-orwell-life |accessdate=22 October 2018 |work=New Statesman}}</ref>\n\nOrwell was declared \"unfit for any kind of military service\" by the Medical Board in June, but soon afterwards found an opportunity to become involved in war activities by joining the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/newsroom/orwell/story/0,,1048203,00.html|title=About George Orwell |website=www.theguardian.com \u2013 Newsroom|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref> He shared [[Tom Wintringham]]'s socialist vision for the Home Guard as a revolutionary People's Militia. His lecture notes for instructing platoon members include advice on street fighting, field fortifications, and the use of [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]] of various kinds. Sergeant Orwell managed to recruit [[Fredric Warburg]] to his unit. During the [[Battle of Britain]] he used to spend weekends with Warburg and his new [[Zionist]] friend, [[T. R. Fyvel|Tosco Fyvel]], at Warburg's house at [[Twyford, Berkshire]]. At Wallington he worked on \"[[England Your England]]\" and in London wrote reviews for various periodicals. Visiting Eileen's family in Greenwich brought him face-to-face with the effects of [[the Blitz]] on East London. In mid-1940, Warburg, Fyvel and Orwell planned [[Searchlight Books]]. Eleven volumes eventually appeared, of which Orwell's ''[[The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius]]'', published on 19 February 1941, was the first.<ref>''A Patriot After All'', p. xviii</ref>\n\nEarly in 1941 he began to write for the American ''[[Partisan Review]]'' which linked Orwell with [[The New York Intellectuals]] who were also anti-Stalinist,<ref>[[Frances Stonor Saunders]], ''[[Who Paid the Piper?]]'', p. 160</ref> and contributed to Gollancz anthology ''The Betrayal of the Left'', written in the light of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] (although Orwell referred to it as the Russo-German Pact and the Hitler-Stalin Pact<ref>''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 2&nbsp;\u2013 My Country Right or Left 1940\u20131943'' p. 40 (Penguin)</ref>). He also applied unsuccessfully for a job at the [[Air Ministry]]. Meanwhile, he was still writing reviews of books and plays and at this time met the novelist [[Anthony Powell]]. He also took part in a few radio broadcasts for the Eastern Service of the BBC. In March the Orwells moved to a seventh-floor flat at Langford Court, [[St John's Wood]], while at Wallington Orwell was \"[[Dig for Victory|digging for victory]]\" by planting potatoes.\n\n{{Quotation|One could not have a better example of the moral and emotional shallowness of our time, than the fact that we are now all more or less pro Stalin.

He supervised cultural broadcasts to India to counter propaganda from Nazi Germany designed to undermine Imperial links. This was Orwell's first experience of the rigid conformity of life in an office, and it gave him an opportunity to create cultural programmes with contributions from [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[E. M. Forster]], [[Ahmad Ali|Ahmed Ali]], [[Mulk Raj Anand]], and [[William Empson]] among others.\n\nAt the end of August he had a dinner with [[H. G. Wells]] which degenerated into a row because Wells had taken offence at observations Orwell made about him in a ''Horizon'' article. In October Orwell had a bout of bronchitis and the illness recurred frequently. [[David Astor]] was looking for a provocative contributor for ''[[The Observer]]'' and invited Orwell to write for him \u2013 the first article appearing in March 1942. In early 1942 Eileen changed jobs to work at the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] and in mid-1942 the Orwells moved to a larger flat, a ground floor and basement, 10a Mortimer Crescent in [[Maida Vale]]/[[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] \u2013 \"the kind of lower-middle-class ambience that Orwell thought was London at its best.\" Around the same time Orwell's mother and sister Avril, who had found work in a [[sheet-metal]] factory behind [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross Station]], moved into a flat close to George and Eileen.<ref>Crick (1982), pp. 432\u201333</ref>\n[[File:George-orwell-BBC.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Orwell spoke on many [[BBC]] and other broadcasts, but no recordings are known to survive.<ref name=\"Bowker2013\">{{cite book|author=Gordon Bowker|title=George Orwell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdAzAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT309|date=14 March 2013|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-1405528054|pages=309\u201310}}</ref><ref name=\"Recordings Capture Writers' Voices Off The Page Listen Queue\">{{cite web|title=Recordings Capture Writers' Voices Off The Page Listen Queue|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96030704|publisher=NPR|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC tried to take George Orwell off air because of 'unattractive' voice\">{{Cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Urmeen|title=BBC tried to take George Orwell off air because of 'unattractive' voice|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/5445579/BBC-tried-to-take-George-Orwell-off-air-because-of-unattractive-voice.html|website=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=5 November 2016|quote=The BBC tried to take the author George Orwell off air because his voice was \"unattractive\", according to archive documents released by the corporation...no recording of Orwell's voice survives but contemporaries \u2013 such as the artist Lucian Freud \u2013 have described it as \"monotonous\" with \"no power\".|date=2009-06-04}}</ref>]]\nAt the BBC, Orwell introduced ''Voice'', a literary programme for his Indian broadcasts, and by now was leading an active social life with literary friends, particularly on the political left.

In March 1943 Orwell's mother died and around the same time he told Moore he was starting work on a new book, which turned out to be ''[[Animal Farm]]''.\n\nIn September 1943, Orwell resigned from the BBC post that he had occupied for two years.<ref name=\"Crick-LBC\">{{cite book|last=Crick|first=Bernard R.|title=George Orwell: A Life|date=1980|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|isbn=978-0316161121}}</ref>{{RP|352}} His resignation followed a report confirming his fears that few Indians listened to the broadcasts,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://orwell.ru/library/novels/Burmese_Days/english/e_mm_int|first=Malcolm |last=Muggeridge|title=Burmese Days ''(Introduction)''|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|year=1962}} Muggeridge recalls that he asked Orwell if such broadcasts were useful, \"'Perhaps not', he said, somewhat crestfallen. He added, more cheerfully, that anyway, no one could pick up the broadcasts except on short-wave sets which cost about the equivalent of an Indian labourer's earnings over 10 years\"</ref> but he was also keen to concentrate on writing ''Animal Farm''. Just six days before his last day of service, on 24 November 1943, his adaptation of the [[fairy tale]], [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s ''[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]'' was broadcast. It was a genre in which he was greatly interested and which appeared on ''Animal Farm''{{'}}s title-page.<ref>''Two Wasted Years'', 1943, p. xxi, Secker & Warburg, 2001</ref> At this time he also resigned from the Home Guard on medical grounds.<ref>''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p. xv. Secker & Warburg, 2001</ref>\n\nIn November 1943, Orwell was appointed literary editor at ''Tribune'', where his assistant was his old friend [[Jon Kimche]]. Orwell was on staff until early 1945, writing over 80 book reviews<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yRHBGAAACAAJ&dq=ISBN0436205521 |author1=Orwell, G. |author2=Davison, P. |title=I Have Tried to Tell the Truth |publisher=Secker & Warburg |location =London |year=1999 |isbn=978-0436203701}}</ref> and on 3 December 1943 started his regular personal column, \"[[As I Please]]\", usually addressing three or four subjects in each.<ref>''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p. xxix</ref> He was still writing reviews for other magazines, including ''Partisan Review'', ''Horizon'', and the New York ''[[The Nation|Nation]]'' and becoming a respected pundit among left-wing circles but also a close friend of people on the right such as Powell, Astor and [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. By April 1944 ''Animal Farm'' was ready for publication. Gollancz refused to publish it, considering it an attack on the Soviet regime which was a crucial ally in the war. A similar fate was met from other publishers (including [[T. S. Eliot]] at [[Faber and Faber]]) until [[Jonathan Cape]] agreed to take it.\n\nIn May the Orwells had the opportunity to adopt a child, thanks to the contacts of Eileen's sister Gwen O'Shaughnessy, then a doctor in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. In June a [[V-1 flying bomb]] struck Mortimer Crescent and the Orwells had to find somewhere else to live. Orwell had to scrabble around in the rubble for his collection of books, which he had finally managed to transfer from Wallington, carting them away in a wheelbarrow.\n\nAnother bombshell was Cape's reversal of his plan to publish ''Animal Farm''. The decision followed his personal visit to [[Peter Smollett]], an official at the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].

[[Secker & Warburg]] had agreed to publish ''Animal Farm'', planned for the following March, although it did not appear in print until August 1945. By February 1945 David Astor had invited Orwell to become a war correspondent for the ''Observer''. Orwell had been looking for the opportunity throughout the war, but his failed medical reports prevented him from being allowed anywhere near action. He went to Paris after the liberation of France and to Cologne once it had been occupied by the Allies.\n\nIt was while he was there that Eileen went into hospital for a [[hysterectomy]] and died under anaesthetic on 29 March 1945. She had not given Orwell much notice about this operation because of worries about the cost and because she expected to make a speedy recovery. Orwell returned home for a while and then went back to Europe. He returned finally to London to cover the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]] at the beginning of July. ''[[Animal Farm]]: A Fairy Story'' was published in Britain on 17 August 1945, and a year later in the US, on 26 August 1946.\n\n===Jura and ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''===\n''Animal Farm'' had particular resonance in the post-war climate and its worldwide success made Orwell a sought-after figure. For the next four years, Orwell mixed journalistic work\u2014mainly for ''Tribune'', ''The Observer'' and the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', though he also contributed to many small-circulation political and [[literary magazine]]s\u2014with writing his best-known work, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', which was published in 1949.\n[[File:Barnhill (Cnoc an t-Sabhail) - geograph.org.uk - 451643.jpg|thumb|[[Barnhill, Jura|Barnhill]] on the Isle of [[Jura, Scotland]].

He employed a housekeeper, Susan Watson, to look after his adopted son at the [[Islington]] flat, which visitors now described as \"bleak\". In September he spent a fortnight on the island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]] and saw it as a place to escape from the hassle of London literary life. David Astor was instrumental in arranging a place for Orwell on Jura.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theorwellprize.co.uk/news/remembering-jura/ |title=Remembering Jura, Richard Blair |publisher=Theorwellprize.co.uk |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> Astor's family owned Scottish estates in the area and a fellow Old Etonian Robin Fletcher had a property on the island. In late 1945 and early 1946 Orwell made several hopeless and unwelcome marriage proposals to younger women, including [[Celia Kirwan]] (who later became [[Arthur Koestler]]'s sister-in-law), Ann Popham who happened to live in the same block of flats and [[Sonia Brownell]], one of Connolly's coterie at the ''Horizon'' office. Orwell suffered a tubercular haemorrhage in February 1946 but disguised his illness. In 1945 or early 1946, while still living at Canonbury Square, Orwell wrote an article on \"British Cookery\", complete with recipes, commissioned by the [[British Council]]. Given the post-war shortages, both parties agreed not to publish it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theorwellprize.co.uk/life-and-work.aspx |title=The Orwell Prize {{!}} Life and Work \u2013 Exclusive Access to the Orwell Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210180526/http://www.theorwellprize.co.uk/life-and-work.aspx |archivedate=10 December 2007}}</ref> His sister Marjorie died of kidney disease in May and shortly after, on 22 May 1946, Orwell set off to live on the Isle of Jura.\n\n[[Barnhill, Jura|Barnhill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orwelltoday.com/jurabarnhillvisit.shtml|title= Barnhill}} is located at {{Coord|56|06|39|N|5|41|30|W|display=inline}} ([[British national grid reference system]] NR705970)</ref> was an abandoned farmhouse with outbuildings near the northern end of the island, situated at the end of a five-mile (8&nbsp;km), heavily rutted track from Ardlussa, where the owners lived. Conditions at the farmhouse were primitive but the natural history and the challenge of improving the place appealed to Orwell. His sister Avril accompanied him there and young novelist [[Paul Potts (writer)|Paul Potts]] made up the party. In July Susan Watson arrived with Orwell's son Richard. Tensions developed and Potts departed after one of his manuscripts was used to light the fire. Orwell meanwhile set to work on ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Later Susan Watson's boyfriend [[David Holbrook]] arrived. A fan of Orwell since school days, he found the reality very different, with Orwell hostile and disagreeable probably because of Holbrook's membership of the Communist Party.<ref>David Holbrook in Stephen Wadham's ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin Books 1984</ref> Susan Watson could no longer stand being with Avril and she and her boyfriend left.\n\nOrwell returned to London in late 1946 and picked up his literary journalism again. Now a well-known writer, he was swamped with work. Apart from a visit to Jura in the new year he stayed in London for [[Winter of 1946\u20131947 in the United Kingdom|one of the coldest British winters on record]] and with such a national shortage of fuel that he burnt his furniture and his child's toys. The heavy smog in the days before the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] did little to help his health about which he was reticent, keeping clear of medical attention. Meanwhile, he had to cope with rival claims of publishers Gollancz and Warburg for publishing rights. About this time he co-edited a collection titled ''British Pamphleteers'' with [[Reginald Reynolds]]. As a result of the success of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell was expecting a large bill from the Inland Revenue and he contacted a firm of accountants of which the senior partner was Jack Harrison. The firm advised Orwell to establish a company to own his copyright and to receive his royalties and set up a \"service agreement\" so that he could draw a salary. Such a company \"George Orwell Productions Ltd\" (GOP Ltd) was set up on 12 September 1947 although the service agreement was not then put into effect. Jack Harrison left the details at this stage to junior colleagues.<ref name=Carroll>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article466206.ece |title=Tim Carroll ''A writer wronged'' The Sunday Times 15 August 2004 |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nOrwell left London for Jura on 10 April 1947.<ref name=Taylor/> In July he ended the lease on the Wallington cottage.<ref>Crick (1982), p. 530</ref> Back on Jura he worked on ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' and made good progress.

In December a chest specialist was summoned from Glasgow who pronounced Orwell seriously ill and a week before Christmas 1947 he was in [[Hairmyres Hospital]] in East Kilbride, then a small village in the countryside, on the outskirts of Glasgow. [[Tuberculosis]] was diagnosed and the request for permission to import [[streptomycin]] to treat Orwell went as far as [[Aneurin Bevan]], then Minister of Health. [[David Astor]] helped with supply and payment and Orwell began his course of streptomycin on 19 or 20 February 1948.<ref>It Is what I Think, p. 274</ref> By the end of July 1948 Orwell was able to return to Jura and by December he had finished the manuscript of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. In January 1949, in a very weak condition, he set off for a sanatorium at [[Cranham, Gloucestershire]], escorted by Richard Rees.\n\nThe sanatorium at Cranham consisted of a series of small wooden chalets or huts in a remote part of the [[Cotswolds]] near [[Stroud]]. Visitors were shocked by Orwell's appearance and concerned by the short-comings and ineffectiveness of the treatment. Friends were worried about his finances, but by now he was comparatively well-off. He was writing to many of his friends, including Jacintha Buddicom, who had \"rediscovered\" him, and in March 1949, was visited by Celia Kirwan. Kirwan had just started working for a [[Foreign Office]] unit, the [[Information Research Department]], set up by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government to publish anti-communist propaganda, and Orwell gave her a list of people he considered to be unsuitable as IRD authors because of their pro-communist leanings. [[Orwell's list]], not published until 2003, consisted mainly of writers but also included actors and Labour MPs.<ref name=\"TGA\"/><ref>{{cite news |work=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities |first=John |last=Ezard |title=Blair's babe: Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge? |date=21 June 2003}}</ref> Orwell received more streptomycin treatment and improved slightly.

In mid-1949, he courted [[Sonia Brownell]], and they announced their engagement in September, shortly before he was removed to [[University College Hospital]] in London.

She was considered to have a strong case, but was becoming increasingly ill and eventually was persuaded to settle out of court on 2 November 1980. She died on 11 December 1980, aged 62.<ref name=Carroll/>\n\n==Literary career and legacy==\nDuring most of his career, Orwell was best known for his journalism, in essays, reviews, columns in newspapers and magazines and in his books of reportage: ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'' (describing a period of poverty in these cities), ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'' (describing the living conditions of the poor in northern England, and class division generally) and ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''. According to [[Irving Howe]], Orwell was \"the best English essayist since [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]], perhaps since [[Samuel Johnson|Dr Johnson]].\"<ref name=\"Howe\">{{Cite journal|authorlink=Irving Howe|title=George Orwell: \"As the bones know\"|first=Irving|last=Howe|journal=[[Harper's Magazine]]|date= January 1969}}(reprinted in ''[[Newsweek]]''). Howe considered Orwell \"the finest journalist of his day and the foremost architect of the English essay since [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]]\".</ref>\n\nModern readers are more often introduced to Orwell as a novelist, particularly through his enormously successful titles ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. The former is often thought to reflect degeneration in the Soviet Union after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the rise of [[Stalinism]]; the latter, life under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian rule]]. ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' is often compared to ''[[Brave New World]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]]; both are powerful [[dystopia]]n novels warning of a future world where the state machine exerts complete control over social life. In 1984, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' and [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' were honoured with the [[Prometheus Award]] for their contributions to dystopian literature. In 2011 he received it again for ''Animal Farm''.\n\n''[[Coming Up for Air]]'', his last novel before World War II, is the most \"English\" of his novels; alarms of war mingle with images of idyllic [[Thames]]-side [[Edwardian]] childhood of protagonist George Bowling. The novel is pessimistic; industrialism and capitalism have killed the best of Old England, and there were great, new external threats. In homely terms, Bowling posits the totalitarian hypotheses of Borkenau, Orwell, Silone and Koestler: \"Old Hitler's something different. So's Joe Stalin. They aren't like these chaps in the old days who crucified people and chopped their heads off and so forth, just for the fun of it&nbsp;... They're something quite new \u2013 something that's never been heard of before\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Penguin complete novels of George Orwell |date=1976 |publisher=Penguin |page=523}}</ref>\n\n===Literary influences===\nIn an autobiographical piece that Orwell sent to the editors of ''Twentieth Century Authors'' in 1940, he wrote: \"The writers I care about most and never grow tired of are: [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Charles Reade]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] and, among modern writers, [[James Joyce]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]]. But I believe the modern writer who has influenced me most is [[W. Somerset Maugham]], whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frills.\" Elsewhere, Orwell strongly praised the works of [[Jack London]], especially his book ''The Road''. Orwell's investigation of poverty in ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' strongly resembles that of Jack London's ''The People of the Abyss'', in which the American journalist disguises himself as an out-of-work sailor to investigate the lives of the poor in London. In his essay \"Politics vs. Literature: An Examination of Gulliver's Travels\" (1946) Orwell wrote: \"If I had to make a list of six books which were to be preserved when all others were destroyed, I would certainly put ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' among them.\"\n\nOrwell was an admirer of [[Arthur Koestler]] and became a close friend during the three years that Koestler and his wife Mamain spent at the cottage of Bwlch Ocyn, a secluded farmhouse that belonged to [[Clough Williams-Ellis]], in the [[Vale of Ffestiniog]]. Orwell reviewed Koestler's. ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' in 1941, saying:\n<blockquote>\nBrilliant as this book is as a novel, and a piece of brilliant literature, it is probably most valuable as an interpretation of the Moscow \u201cconfessions\u201d by someone with an inner knowledge of totalitarian methods. What was frightening about these trials was not the fact that they happened \u2013 for obviously such things are necessary in a totalitarian society \u2013 but the eagerness of Western intellectuals to justify them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/to-the-detriment-of-us-all-the-untouched-legacy-of-arthur-koestler-and-george-orwell/|title=The Untouched Legacy of Arthur Koestler and George Orwell|date=24 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOther writers admired by Orwell included: [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[George Gissing]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Tobias Smollett]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Joseph Conrad]], and [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]].<ref>''Letter to Gleb Struve, 17 February 1944'', Orwell: Essays, Journalism and Letters Vol 3, eds.

Sonia Brownell and Ian Angus, p. 576</ref>\n\n===Orwell as literary critic===\nThroughout his life Orwell continually supported himself as a book reviewer, writing works so long and sophisticated they have had an influence on literary criticism. He wrote in the conclusion to his 1940 essay on [[Charles Dickens]],\n{{quote|When one reads any strongly individual piece of writing, one has the impression of seeing a face somewhere behind the page. It is not necessarily the actual face of the writer. I feel this very strongly with [[Jonathon Swift|Swift]], with [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], with [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], [[Stendhal]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], though in several cases I do not know what these people looked like and do not want to know. What one sees is the face that the writer ought to have. Well, in the case of Dickens I see a face that is not quite the face of Dickens's photographs, though it resembles it. It is the face of a man of about forty, with a small beard and a high colour. He is laughing, with a touch of anger in his laughter, but no triumph, no malignity. It is the face of a man who is always fighting against something, but who fights in the open and is not frightened, the face of a man who is generously angry \u2013 in other words, of a nineteenth-century liberal, a free intelligence, a type hated with equal hatred by all the smelly little orthodoxies which are now contending for our souls.}}\n\n[[George Woodcock]] suggested that the last two sentences also describe Orwell.<ref>George Woodcock Introduction to Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin 1984</ref>\n\nOrwell wrote a critique of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Arms and the Man#Critical acclaim|Arms and the Man]]''. He considered this Shaw's best play and the most likely to remain socially relevant, because of its theme that war is not, generally speaking, a glorious romantic adventure. His 1945 essay ''In Defense of P.G. Wodehouse'' contains an amusing assessment of Wodehouse's writing and also argues that his broadcasts from Germany (during the war) did not really make him a traitor. He accused [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|The Ministry of Information]] of exaggerating Wodehouse's actions for propaganda purposes.\n\n===Reception and evaluations of Orwell's works===\nArthur Koestler said that Orwell's \"uncompromising intellectual honesty made him appear almost inhuman at times.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orwelltoday.com/orwellpersona.shtml|title= Orwell Today}}</ref> [[Ben Wattenberg]] stated: \"Orwell's writing pierced intellectual hypocrisy wherever he found it.\"<ref name=\"thinktank\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript990.html|title=PBS: Think Tank: Transcript for \"Orwell's Century\"|work=pbs.org|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref> According to historian [[Piers Brendon]], \"Orwell was the saint of common decency who would in earlier days, said his BBC boss Rushbrook Williams, 'have been either canonised&nbsp;\u2013 or burnt at the stake'\".<ref>{{Cite news|newspaper=The Guardian |location=UK |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/07/biography.georgeorwell|title=The saint of common decency|first=Piers|last=Brendon|date=7 June 2003}}</ref> [[Raymond Williams]] in [[Politics and Letters: Interviews with New Left Review]] describes Orwell as a \"successful impersonation of a plain man who bumps into experience in an unmediated way and tells the truth about it.\"<ref>Raymond Williams ''Politics and Letters'' 1979</ref> [[Christopher Norris (critic)|Christopher Norris]] declared that Orwell's \"homespun empiricist outlook&nbsp;\u2013 his assumption that the truth was just there to be told in a straightforward common-sense way&nbsp;\u2013 now seems not merely na\u00efve but culpably self-deluding\".<ref>Christopher Norris ''Language, Truth and Ideology:Orwell and the Post War Left'' in ''Inside the Myth:Orwell views from the Left'' Lawrence and Whishart 1984</ref> The American scholar Scott Lucas has described Orwell<ref>Lucas, Scott (2003).

Alan Brown noted that this brings to the forefront questions about the political content of teaching practices. Study aids, in particular with potted biographies, might be seen to help propagate the Orwell myth so that as an embodiment of human values he is presented as a \"trustworthy guide\", while examination questions sometimes suggest the \"right ways of answering\" in line with the myth.<ref>Alan Brown ''Examining Orwell: Political and Literary Values in Education'' in Christopher Norris ''Inside the Myth Orwell:Views from the Left'' Lawrence and Wishart 1984</ref>{{Clarify|date=September 2010|reason=precise language needed; see [[Talk:George Orwell#Reactions to Orwell's works unclear]]}}\n\nHistorian John Rodden stated: \"[[John Podhoretz]] did claim that if Orwell were alive today, he'd be standing with the [[neo-conservatives]] and against the Left.

Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and ''for'' Democratic Socialism as I understand it.\" (emphasis in original)<ref name=\"thinktank\"/> Rodden goes on to explain how, during the McCarthy era, the introduction to the Signet edition of ''Animal Farm'', which sold more than 20 million copies, makes use of \"the politics of ellipsis\":\n<blockquote>\nIf the book itself, ''Animal Farm'', had left any doubt of the matter, Orwell dispelled it in his essay ''Why I Write'': 'Every line of serious work that I've written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against Totalitarianism&nbsp;... dot, dot, dot, dot.' \"For Democratic Socialism\" is vaporised, just like Winston Smith did it at the Ministry of Truth, and that's very much what happened at the beginning of the McCarthy era and just continued, Orwell being selectively quoted.<ref name=\"thinktank\"/></blockquote>\n\nFyvel wrote about Orwell: \"His crucial experience&nbsp;[...] was his struggle to turn himself into a writer, one which led through long periods of poverty, failure and humiliation, and about which he has written almost nothing directly.

In that essay, Orwell provides six rules for writers:\n<blockquote>\n# Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.\n# Never use a long word where a short one will do.\n# If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.\n# Never use the passive where you can use the active.\n# Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.\n# Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm\n |first       = George\n |last        = Orwell\n |title       = Politics and the English Language\n |date        = April 1946\n |publisher   = [[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]\n |work        = mtholyoke.edu\n |accessdate  = 15 July 2010\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100715144246/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm\n |archivedate = 15 July 2010\n |df          = dmy\n}}</ref></blockquote>\nAndrew N. Rubin argues that \"Orwell claimed that we should be attentive to how the use of language has limited our capacity for critical thought just as we should be equally concerned with the ways in which dominant modes of thinking have reshaped the very language that we use.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Rubin|first=Andrew N|url=http://outsidethewhale.com/2011/10/04/70/|title=The Rhetoric of Perpetual War|accessdate=11 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123221507/http://outsidethewhale.com/2011/10/04/70/|archivedate=23 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe adjective \"[[Orwellian]]\" connotes an attitude and a policy of control by propaganda, surveillance, misinformation, denial of truth and manipulation of the past. In ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', Orwell described a totalitarian government that controlled thought by controlling language, making certain ideas literally unthinkable. Several words and phrases from ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' have entered popular language. \"[[Newspeak]]\" is a simplified and obfuscatory language designed to make independent thought impossible. \"[[Doublethink]]\" means holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously. The \"[[Thought Police]]\" are those who suppress all dissenting opinion. \"[[Prolefeed]]\" is homogenised, manufactured superficial literature, film and music used to control and indoctrinate the populace through docility. \"[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]\" is a supreme dictator who watches everyone.\n\nOrwell may have been the first to use the term \"[[cold war (general term)|cold war]]\" to refer to the state of tension between powers in the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc that followed World War II in his essay, \"You and the Atom Bomb\", published in ''Tribune'' on 19 October 1945. He wrote:\n<blockquote>We may be heading not for general breakdown but for an epoch as horribly stable as the slave empires of antiquity.

His first article, \"La Censure en Angleterre\" (\"Censorship in England\"), was an attempt to account for the \"extraordinary and illogical\" moral censorship of plays and novels then practised in Britain. His own explanation was that the rise of the \"puritan middle class,\" who had stricter morals than the aristocracy, tightened the rules of censorship in the 19th century. Orwell's first published article in his home country, \"A Farthing Newspaper\", was a critique of the new French daily the ''Ami de Peuple''. This paper was sold much more cheaply than most others, and was intended for ordinary people to read. Orwell pointed out that its proprietor [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]] also owned the right-wing dailies ''[[Le Figaro]]'' and ''[[Le Gaulois]]'', which the ''Ami de Peuple'' was supposedly competing against. Orwell suggested that cheap newspapers were no more than a vehicle for advertising and anti-leftist propaganda, and predicted the world might soon see [[free newspapers]] which would drive legitimate dailies out of business.<ref>{{Citation |first = P |last = Davison |title = A Kind of Compulsion |publisher = Secker & Warburg |place = London |year = 2000 |pages = 117\u201321}}</ref>\n[[File:Logo of the Independent Labour Party.svg|alt=The letters \"ISLP\" in white on a red circle|thumb|upright|Orwell joined the [[Independent Labour Party]] during his time in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and became a defender of [[democratic socialism]] and a critic of [[totalitarianism]] for the rest of his life.]]\nThe Spanish Civil War played the most important part in defining Orwell's socialism.

He left the ILP because of its opposition to the war and adopted a political position of \"revolutionary patriotism\". In December 1940 he wrote in ''Tribune'' (the Labour left's weekly): \"We are in a strange period of history in which a revolutionary has to be a patriot and a patriot has to be a revolutionary.\" During the war, Orwell was highly critical of the popular idea that an Anglo-Soviet alliance would be the basis of a post-war world of peace and prosperity. In 1942, commenting on journalist [[E. H. Carr]]'s pro-Soviet views, Orwell stated that \"all the appeasers, e.g. Professor E.H.

Ungregarious, he was out of place in a crowd and his discomfort was exacerbated when he was outside his own class. Though representing himself as a spokesman for the common man, he often appeared out of place with real working people. His brother-in-law Humphrey Dakin, a \"Hail fellow, well met\" type, who took him to a local pub in Leeds, said that he was told by the landlord: \"Don't bring that bugger in here again.\"<ref>Ian Angus Interview 23\u201325 April 1965 quoted in Stansky and Abrahams ''The Unknown George Orwell''</ref> Adrian Fierz commented \"He wasn't interested in racing or greyhounds or pub crawling or [[shove ha'penny]].

[[Jack Common]] observed on meeting him for the first time, \"Right away manners, and more than manners \u2013 breeding \u2013 showed through.\"<ref>Jack Common Collection Newcastle University Library quoted in Crick (1982), p. 204</ref>\n\nIn his tramping days, he did domestic work for a time. His extreme politeness was recalled by a member of the family he worked for; she declared that the family referred to him as \"[[Stan Laurel|Laurel]]\" after the film comedian.<ref name=\"autogenerated1996\"/> With his gangling figure and awkwardness, Orwell's friends often saw him as a figure of fun. [[Geoffrey Gorer]] commented \"He was awfully likely to knock things off tables, trip over things. I mean, he was a gangling, physically badly co-ordinated young man. I think his feeling [was] that even the inanimate world was against him.\"<ref>Geoffrey Gorer&nbsp;\u2013 recorded for Melvyn Bragg BBC Omnibus production ''The Road to the Left'' 1970</ref> When he shared a flat with Heppenstall and Sayer, he was treated in a patronising manner by the younger men.<ref>Rayner Heppenstall ''Four Absentees'' in Audrey Coppard and Bernard Crick ''Orwell Remembered'' 1984</ref> At the BBC in the 1940s, \"everybody would pull his leg\"<ref name =Wilshin>Sunday Wilshin in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin Books 1984</ref> and Spender described him as having real entertainment value \"like, as I say, watching a Charlie Chaplin movie.\"<ref>Stephen Spender in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin Books 1984</ref> A friend of Eileen's reminisced about her tolerance and humour, often at Orwell's expense.<ref name=Donahue/> Psychiatrist [[Michael Fitzgerald (psychiatrist)|Michael Fitzgerald]] has speculated that Orwell's social and physical awkwardness, limited interests and monotone voice were the result of [[Asperger syndrome]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Iggulden |first=Amy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1491791/Missing-link-between-madness-and-genius.html |title='Missing link' between madness and genius |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=11 June 2005 |accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne biography of Orwell accused him of having had an authoritarian streak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780805076936-1 |title=Powell's Books&nbsp;\u2013 Synopses and Reviews of D J Taylor ''Orwell:The Life'' |publisher=Powells.com |date=12 October 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref> In Burma, he struck out at a Burmese boy who, while \"fooling around\" with his friends, had \"accidentally bumped into him\" at a station, resulting in Orwell falling \"heavily\" down some stairs.<ref>Maung Htin Aung ''George Orwell and Burma'' in Miriam Goss ''The World of George Orwell'' Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1971</ref> One of his former pupils recalled [[school corporal punishment|being beaten]] so hard he could not sit down for a week.<ref>Interview with Geoffrey Stevens, Crick (1982), pp. 222\u201323</ref> When sharing a flat with Orwell, Heppenstall came home late one night in an advanced stage of loud inebriation. The upshot was that Heppenstall ended up with a bloody nose and was locked in a room. When he complained, Orwell hit him across the legs with a [[shooting stick]] and Heppenstall then had to defend himself with a chair. Years later, after Orwell's death, Heppenstall wrote a dramatic account of the incident called \"The Shooting Stick\"<ref>Heppenstall ''The Shooting Stick'' Twentieth Century April 1955</ref> and Mabel Fierz confirmed that Heppenstall came to her in a sorry state the following day.<ref>Crick (1982), pp. 274\u201375</ref>\n\nOrwell got on well with young people. The pupil he beat considered him the best of teachers and the young recruits in Barcelona tried to drink him under the table without success. His nephew recalled Uncle Eric laughing louder than anyone in the cinema at a [[Charlie Chaplin]] film.<ref name= Dakin/>\n\nIn the wake of his most famous works, he attracted many uncritical hangers-on, but many others who sought him found him aloof and even dull. With his soft voice, he was sometimes shouted down or excluded from discussions.<ref>Michael Meyer ''Not Prince Hamlet: Literary and Theatrical Memoirs'' Secker and Warburg 1989</ref> At this time, he was severely ill; it was wartime or the austerity period after it; during the war his wife suffered from depression; and after her death he was lonely and unhappy.

It is the only species classified in the genus '''''Callimico''''', and the monkeys are sometimes referred to as \"callimicos\".\n\nGoeldi's marmosets are blackish or blackish-brown in color and the hair on their head and tail sometimes has red, white, or silverly brown highlights.<ref name='Falk'/> Their bodies are about {{convert|8|\u2013|9|in|cm}} long, and their tails are about {{convert|10|\u2013|12|in|cm}} long.\n[[File:Goeldis monkey - butterfly lunch - big.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Marmoset eating a butterfly]]\n[[File:Callimico goeldii in Venezuela.jpg|thumb|left|Marmoset in [[Venezuela]]]]\n[[File:Callimico goeldii, Universeum.ogv|thumb|left|''Callimico goeldii'' at [[Universeum]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]]]]\nGoeldi's marmoset was first described in 1904, making ''Callimico'' one of the more recent monkey genera to be described. In older classification schemes it was sometimes placed in its own family '''Callimiconidae''' and sometimes along with the [[marmoset]]s and [[tamarin]]s in the subfamily [[Callitrichinae]] in the family [[Cebidae]]. More recently, Callitrichinae has been (re-)elevated to family status as [[Callitrichidae]].\n\nFemales reach sexual maturity at 8.5 months, males at 16.5 months. The gestation period lasts from 140 to 180 days. Unlike other New World monkeys, they have the capacity to give birth twice a year. The mother carries a single baby monkey per pregnancy, whereas most other species in the family Callitrichidae usually give birth to twins. For the first 2\u20133 weeks the mother acts as the primary caregiver until the father takes over most of the responsibilities except for nursing. The infant is weaned after about 65 days. Females outnumber males by 2 to 1.<ref name='Falk'>Falk, Dean (2000). ''Primate Diversity.'' W.W. Norton and Company, {{ISBN|0-393-97428-6}}.</ref> The life expectancy in captivity is about 10 years.\n\nGoeldi's marmosets prefer to forage in dense scrubby undergrowth; perhaps because of this, they are rare, with groups living in separate patches of suitable habitat, separated by miles of unsuitable flora. In the wet season, their diet includes fruit, insects, spiders, lizards, frogs, and snakes. In the dry season, they feed on [[fungi]], the only tropical primates known to depend on this source of food. They live in small social groups (approximately six individuals) that stay within a few feet of one another most of the time, staying in contact via high-pitched calls. They are also known to form [[polyspecific group]]s with [[tamarin]]s, perhaps because Goeldi's marmosets are not known to have the X-linked polymorphism which enables some individuals of other New World monkey species to see in full [[Trichromacy|tri-chromatic vision]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Surridge AK, Mundy NI | year = 2002 | title = Trans-specific evolution of opsin alleles and the

However, this distinction is not universally observed in the English-speaking world. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the regulator of gambling activities is called the [[Gambling Commission]] (not the Gaming Commission).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/ |title=UK Gambling Commission |website=Gamblingcommission.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-22}}</ref> The word ''gaming'' is used more frequently since the rise of [[computer games|computer]] and [[video game]]s to describe activities that do not necessarily involve wagering, especially [[online game|online gaming]], with the new usage still not having displaced the old usage as the primary definition in common dictionaries.\n\nGambling is also a major international commercial activity, with the legal gambling market totaling an estimated $335 billion in 2009.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/16539402 | work=The Economist | title=You bet | date=8 July 2010}}</ref>  In other forms, gambling can be conducted with materials which have a value, but are not real money. For example, players of [[Marble (toy)#Marbles games|marbles games]] might wager marbles, and likewise games of  ''[[Pogs]]'' or ''[[Magic: The Gathering#Gambling|Magic: The Gathering]]'' can be played with the collectible game pieces (respectively, small discs and trading cards) as stakes, resulting in a [[Metagaming|meta-game]] regarding the value of a player's collection of pieces.\n\n==History==\nGambling dates back to the [[Paleolithic]] period, before written history. In [[Mesopotamia]] the earliest six-sided [[dice]] date to about 3000 BC. However, they were based on [[Astragalomancy|astragali]] dating back thousands of years earlier. In China, gambling houses were widespread in the first millennium BC, and betting on fighting animals was common. Lotto games and dominoes (precursors of [[Pai Gow]]) appeared in China as early as the 10th century.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Schwartz|first1= David|title= Roll The Bones: The History of Gambling|date= January 7, 2013|publisher= Winchester Books|isbn= 978-0615847788}}</ref>\n\nPlaying cards appeared in the ninth century in China.

Such regulation generally leads to [[Tourism#Special forms of tourism|gambling tourism]] and illegal gambling in the areas where it is not allowed. The involvement of governments, through regulation and taxation, has led to a close connection between many governments and gaming organizations, where legal gambling provides significant government revenue, such as in [[Monaco]] or [[Macau|Macau, China]].\n\nThere is generally legislation requiring that the odds in gaming devices are [[statistical randomness|statistically random]], to prevent manufacturers from making some high-payoff results impossible. Since these high-payoffs have very low [[probability]], a house bias can quite easily be missed unless the odds are checked carefully.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gaming.nv.gov/|title=Nevada Gaming Control Board : Home|publisher=|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nMost jurisdictions that allow gambling require participants to be above a certain age. In some jurisdictions, the [[gambling age]] differs depending on the type of gambling. For example, in many American states one must be over 21 to enter a casino, but may buy a lottery ticket after turning 18.\n\n===Insurance===\nBecause contracts of [[insurance]] have many features in common with wagers, insurance contracts are often distinguished under law as agreements in which either party has an interest in the \"bet-upon\" outcome ''beyond'' the specific financial terms. e.g.: a \"bet\" with an insurer on whether one's house will burn down is not gambling, but rather ''insurance'' \u2014 as the homeowner has an obvious interest in the continued existence of his/her home ''independent of'' the purely financial aspects of the \"bet\" (i.e., the insurance policy). Nonetheless, both insurance and gambling contracts are typically considered [[aleatory contract]]s under most legal systems, though they are subject to different types of regulation.\n\n===Asset recovery===\nUnder [[common law]], particularly [[English Law]] ([[English unjust enrichment]]), a gambling contract may not give a casino [[bona fide purchaser|''bona fide'' purchaser]] status, permitting the recovery of stolen funds in some situations. In ''[[Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd]]'', where a solicitor used stolen funds to gamble at a casino, the [[House of Lords]] overruled the High Court's previous verdict, adjudicating that the casino return the stolen funds less those subject to any [[change of position]] defence. U.S. Law precedents are somewhat similar.<ref>See 38 Am. Jur. 2d ''Gambling'' \u00a7 162.</ref> For [[case law]] on recovery of gambling losses where the loser had stolen the funds see \"Rights of owner of stolen money as against one who won it in gambling transaction from thief\".<ref>Annotation, 44 A.L.R.2d 1242.</ref>\n\nAn interesting wrinkle to these fact pattern is to ask what happens when the person trying to make recovery is the gambler's spouse, and the money or property lost was either the spouse's, or was [[community property]]. This was a minor plot point in a [[Perry Mason bibliography|Perry Mason]] novel, ''The Case of the Singing Skirt'', and it cites an actual case ''Novo v. Hotel Del Rio''.<ref>141 Cal. 2d 304, 295 P.2d 576 (3d Dist. 1956) (wife entitled to recover husband's gambling losses on the ground that he had made a gift of community property without her written consent); see also 38 Am.

Ancient [[Hindu]] poems like the [[Gambler's Lament]] and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' testify to the popularity of gambling among ancient Indians.

Wagering may take place through [[parimutuel betting|parimutuel]] pools, or [[bookmaker]]s may take bets personally. Parimutuel wagers pay off at prices determined by support in the wagering pools, while bookmakers pay off either at the odds offered at the time of accepting the bet; or at the median odds offered by track bookmakers at the time the race started.\n\n====Sports betting====\n{{Main article|Sports betting}}\n[[File:Tokyo Racecourse 3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tokyo Racecourse]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan.]]\n\nBetting on team sports has become an important [[service industry]] in many countries. For example, millions of people play the [[football pools]] every week in the [[United Kingdom]]. In addition to organized sports betting, both legal and illegal, there are many side-betting games played by casual groups of spectators, such as [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Basketball Tournament]] Bracket Pools, [[Super Bowl]] Squares, [[Fantasy sport|Fantasy Sports Leagues]] with monetary entry fees and winnings, and in-person spectator games like [[Moundball]].\n\n===Virtual Sports===\n{{Main article|Virtual sports}}\nBased on Sports Betting, Virtual Sports are fantasy and never played sports events made by software that can be played everytime without wondering about external things like weather conditions.\n\n===Arbitrage betting===\n{{Main article|Arbitrage betting}}\nArbitrage betting is a theoretically risk-free betting system in which every outcome of an event is bet upon so that a known profit will be made by the bettor upon completion of the event, regardless of the outcome. Arbitrage betting is a combination of the ancient art of [[arbitrage]] trading and gambling, which has been made possible by the large numbers of bookmakers in the marketplace, creating occasional opportunities for arbitrage.\n\n===Other types of betting===\nOne can also bet with another person that a statement is true or false, or that a specified event will happen (a \"back bet\") or will not happen (a \"lay bet\") within a specified time. This occurs in particular when two people have opposing but strongly held views on truth or events. Not only do the parties hope to gain from the bet, they place the bet also to demonstrate their certainty about the issue. Some means of determining the issue at stake must exist. Sometimes the amount bet remains nominal, demonstrating the outcome as one of principle rather than of financial importance.\n\n[[Bet exchange|Betting exchanges]] allow consumers to both back and lay at odds of their choice. Similar in some ways to a stock exchange, a bettor may want to back a horse (hoping it will win) or lay a horse (hoping it will lose, effectively acting as bookmaker).\n\n[[Spread betting]] allows gamblers to wagering on the outcome of an event where the pay-off is based on the accuracy of the wager, rather than a simple \"win or lose\" outcome.  For example, a wager can be based on the when a point is scored in the game in minutes and each minute away from the prediction increases or reduces the payout.\n\n==Staking systems==\n{{Main article|Betting strategy}}\nMany betting systems have been created in an attempt to \"beat the house\" but no system can make a mathematically unprofitable bet in terms of [[expected value]] profitable over time. Widely used systems include:\n*[[Card counting]] \u2013 Many systems exist for [[Blackjack]] to keep track of the ratio of ten values to all others; when this ratio is high the player has an advantage and should increase the amount of their bets. Keeping track of cards dealt confers an advantage in other games as well.\n*[[Due-column betting]] \u2013 A variation on fixed profits betting in which the bettor sets a target profit and then calculates a bet size that will make this profit, adding any losses to the target.\n*Fixed profits \u2013 the stakes vary based on the odds to ensure the same profit from each winning selection.\n*Fixed stakes \u2013 a traditional system of staking the same amount on each selection.\n*[[Kelly criterion|Kelly]] \u2013 the optimum level to bet to maximize your future median bank level.\n*[[Martingale (betting system)|Martingale]] \u2013 A system based on staking enough each time to recover losses from previous bet(s) until one wins.\n\n==Other uses of the term==\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2010}}\n[[File:Gloria Mundi, or The Devil addressing the sun - Pare.

Insurers use actuarial methods to calculate appropriate premiums, which is similar to calculating gambling odds. Insurers set their premiums to obtain a long term positive expected return in the same manner that professional gamblers select which bets to make. While insurance is sometimes distinguished from gambling by the requirement of an [[insurable interest]], the equivalent in gambling is simply betting against one's own best interests (e.g., a sports coach betting against his own team to mitigate the financial repercussions of a losing season).\n*Situations where the possible return is of secondary importance to the wager/purchase (e.g. entering a [[raffle]] in support of a [[charitable gambling|charitable]] cause)\n\n[[Investments]] are also usually not considered gambling, although some investments can involve significant risk. Examples of investments include [[stock]]s, [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and [[real estate]]. Starting a business can also be considered a form of investment. Investments are generally not considered gambling when they meet the following criteria:\n*Economic utility\n*Positive expected returns (at least in the long term)\n*Underlying value independent of the risk being undertaken\n\nSome [[speculation|speculative]] investment activities are particularly risky, but are sometimes perceived to be different from gambling:\n*Foreign currency exchange ([[forex]]) transactions\n*[[Prediction markets]]\n*Securities [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], such as [[Option (finance)|options]] or [[Futures contract|futures]], where the value of the derivative is dependent on the value of the underlying asset at a specific point in time (typically the derivative's associated expiration date)\n\n==Negative consequences==\n{{Main article|Problem gambling}}\nStudies show that though many people participate in gambling as a form of [[recreation]] or even as a means to gain an income, gambling, like any behavior that involves variation in [[brain chemistry]], can become a harmful, [[behavioral addiction]]. Behavioral addiction can occur with all the negative consequences in a person's life minus the physical issues faced by people who compulsively engage in drug and alcohol abuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanaddictioncenters.org/behavioral-addictions/|title=What Is Process Addiction & Types of Addictive Behaviors?|publisher=}}</ref> [[Reinforcement]] schedules may also make gamblers persist in gambling even after repeated losses.{{mcn|date=November 2015}} This is where the mafia often ends up making large profits, for example the Lucchese crime family book maker and collector \"Big Mike Edwards\" aka \"Mikey muscles\" would allow gamblers lines of credit and charge high percentage rates known as vigs to be paid weekly. Late or missed payments would result in visits and threats from such crime family members\n\nThe Russian writer and problem gambler [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] portrays in his novella ''[[The Gambler (novella)|The Gambler]]'' the psychological implications of gambling and how gambling can affect gamblers. He also associates gambling and the idea of \"[[get rich quick|getting rich quick]]\", suggesting that Russians may have a particular affinity for gambling. Dostoevsky shows the effect of betting money for the chance of gaining more in 19th-century Europe. The association between Russians and gambling has fed legends of the origins of [[Russian roulette]]. \nThere are many symptoms and reasons for gambling. Gamblers gamble more money to try and win back money that they have lost and some gamble to relieve feelings of helplessness and anxiety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/compulsive-gambling/symptoms-causes/dxc-20258394|title=Symptoms and causes - Mayo Clinic|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] has censured several betting firms for advertisements disguised as news articles suggesting falsely a person had cleared debts and paid for medical expenses by online gambling.

For example, gamblers exhibit a costly aversion to betting against their favorite team or political candidate.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* ''Preference for likely outcomes''. When gambles are selected through a choice process - when people indicate which gamble they prefer from a set of gambles (e.g., win/lose, over/under) - people tend to prefer to bet on the outcome that is more likely to occur. Bettors tend to prefer to bet on favorites in athletic competitions, and sometimes will accept even bets on favorites when offered more favorable bets on the less likely outcome (e.g., an underdog team).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Joseph P.|last2=Nelson|first2=Leif D.|title=Intuitive confidence: Choosing between intuitive and nonintuitive alternatives.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0096-3445.135.3.409|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=135|issue=3|pages=409\u2013428|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.135.3.409}}</ref>     \n* ''[[Optimism bias|Optimism]]/Desirability Bias'''.''''' Gamblers also exhibit optimism, overestimating the likelihood that desired events will occur.

Gamblers exhibit reluctance to bet against the success of their preferred U.S. presidential candidates and Major League Baseball, National Football League, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball, and NCAA hockey teams. More than 45% of NCAA fans in Studies 5 and 6, for instance, turned down a \"free\" real $5 bet against their team. From a psychological perspective, such a \"[[Hedge (finance)|hedge]]\" creates an interdependence dilemma\u2014a motivational conflict between a short-term monetary gain and the long-term benefits accrued from feelings of [[Social identity theory|identification]] with and loyalty to a position, person, or group whom the bettor desires to succeed.  In economic terms, this conflicted decision can be modeled as a trade-off between the outcome utility gained by hedging (e.g., money) and the [[Signalling (economics)|diagnostic costs]] it incurs (e.g., disloyalty). People make [[Self-perception theory|inferences]] about their beliefs and identity from their behavior. If a person is uncertain about an aspect of his or her identity, such as the extent to which he or she values a candidate or team, hedging may signal to him or her that he or she is not as committed to that candidate or team as he or she originally believed. If the diagnostic cost of this self-signal and the resulting identity change are substantial, it may outweigh the outcome utility of hedging, and he or she may reject even very generous hedges.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* ''Ratio bias.'' Gamblers will prefer gambles with worse odds that are drawn from a large sample (e.g., drawing one red ball from an urn containing 89 red balls and 11 blue balls) to better odds that are drawn from a small sample (drawing one red ball from an urn containing 9 red balls and one blue ball).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pacini|first=Rosemary|last2=Epstein|first2=Seymour|title=The relation of rational and experiential information processing styles to personality, basic beliefs, and the ratio-bias phenomenon.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.76.6.972|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=76|issue=6|pages=972\u2013987|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.76.6.972|pmid=10402681|date=June 1999}}</ref> \n* ''[[Gambler's fallacy]]/positive recency bias.''\n\n== See also ==\n[[File:A photo of a gambling stand in Paris.jpg|thumb|A gambling stand in [[Paris]]]]\n\n* {{Portal-inline|Gambling}}\n*[[Casino]]\n*[[Comps (casino)]]\n*[[Faro Ladies]]\n*[[Gambler's conceit]]\n*[[Gambler's fallacy]]\n*[[Gambler's ruin]]\n*[[Gaming mathematics]]\n*[[List of bets]]\n*[[Lottery]]\n*[[Mobile gambling]]\n*[[Online gambling]]\n*[[List of mergers and acquisitions in online gambling]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--===========================( NoMoreLinks )===============================-->\n<!--| DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

Originally, it addressed [[zero-sum game]]s, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an [[umbrella term]] for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.\n\nModern game theory began with the idea regarding the existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person [[zero-sum game]]s and its proof by [[John von Neumann]]. Von Neumann's original proof used the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] on continuous mappings into compact [[convex set]]s, which became a standard method in game theory and [[mathematical economics]]. His paper was followed by the 1944 book ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'', co-written with [[Oskar Morgenstern]], which considered [[cooperative game]]s of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.\n\nGame theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars. It was later explicitly applied to biology in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. {{As of|2014}}, with the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] going to game theorist [[Jean Tirole]], eleven game theorists have won the economics Nobel Prize. [[John Maynard Smith]] was awarded the [[Crafoord Prize]] for his application of game theory to biology.\n\n==History==\n[[File:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|[[John von Neumann]]]]\n[[File:John f nash 20061102 3.jpg|thumb|[[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]]]]\n\nEarly discussions of examples of two-person games occurred long before the rise of modern, mathematical game theory. The first known discussion of game theory occurred in a letter written by Charles Waldegrave, an active Jacobite, and uncle to [[James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave|James Waldegrave]], a British diplomat, in 1713.<ref name=\"GT-PD-01\">{{citation |url=http://www.jehps.net/Decembre2007/Bellhouse.pdf |title=The Problem of Waldegrave |author=Bellhouse, David |journal=Journal \u00c9lectronique d'Histoire des Probabilit\u00e9s et de la Statistique |year=2007 |volume=3 |issue=2}}</ref> In this letter, Waldegrave provides a [[minimax]] [[mixed strategy]] solution to a two-person version of the card game [[le Her]], and the problem is now known as [[Waldegrave problem]]. [[James Madison]] made what is now recognized as a game-theoretic analysis of the ways states can be expected to behave under different systems of taxation.<ref>James Madison, [http://www.constitution.org/jm/17870400_vices.htm Vices of the Political System of the United States], April 1787.</ref><ref>Jack Rakove, [http://www.historynow.org/09_2007/historian2.html \"James Madison and the Constitution\"], ''History Now'', Issue 13, September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411192100/http://www.historynow.org/09_2007/historian2.html |date=11 April 2009 }}</ref> In his 1838 ''Recherches sur les principes math\u00e9matiques de la th\u00e9orie des richesses'' (''Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth''), [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] considered a [[duopoly]] and presents a solution that is a restricted version of the [[Nash equilibrium]].\n\nIn 1913, [[Ernst Zermelo]] published ''\u00dcber eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels'' (''On an Application of Set Theory to the Theory of the Game of Chess''). It proved that the optimal chess strategy is [[Strictly determined game|strictly determined]]. This paved the way for more general theorems.<ref name=ohet />{{rp|429}}\n\nIn 1938, the Danish mathematical economist [[Frederik Zeuthen]] proved that the mathematical model had a winning strategy by using [[Brouwer fixed point theorem|Brouwer's fixed point theorem]].<ref>{{cite book|editor=Kim, Sungwook|title=Game theory applications in network design|page=3|publisher=IGI Global|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phOXBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA3}}</ref> In his 1938 book ''Applications aux Jeux de Hasard'' and earlier notes, [[\u00c9mile Borel]] proved a minimax theorem for two-person zero-sum matrix games only when the pay-off matrix was symmetric.

Von Neumann's work in game theory culminated in this 1944 book. This foundational work contains the method for finding mutually consistent solutions for two-person zero-sum games. During the following time period, work on game theory was primarily focused on [[cooperative game]] theory, which analyzes optimal strategies for groups of individuals, presuming that they can enforce agreements between them about proper strategies.<ref>{{citation |last=Leonard |first=Robert |title=Von Neumann, Morgenstern, and the Creation of Game Theory |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=9780521562669}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, the first mathematical discussion of the [[prisoner's dilemma]] appeared, and an experiment was undertaken by notable mathematicians [[Merrill M. Flood]] and [[Melvin Dresher]], as part of the [[RAND Corporation]]'s investigations into game theory. RAND pursued the studies because of possible applications to global [[nuclear strategy]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/ Prisoner's Dilemma]. Plato.stanford.edu (4 September 1997). Retrieved on 3 January 2013.</ref> Around this same time, [[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]] developed a criterion for mutual consistency of players' strategies, known as [[Nash equilibrium]], applicable to a wider variety of games than the criterion proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern. Nash proved that every n-player, non-zero-sum (not just 2-player zero-sum) [[non-cooperative game]] has what is now known as a Nash equilibrium.\n\nGame theory experienced a flurry of activity in the 1950s, during which time the concepts of the [[core (economics)|core]], the [[extensive form game]], [[fictitious play]], [[repeated game]]s, and the [[Shapley value]] were developed. In addition, the first applications of game theory to [[philosophy]] and [[political science]] occurred during this time.\n\nIn 1979 [[Robert Axelrod]] tried setting up computer programs as players and found that in tournaments between them the winner was often a simple \"tit-for-tat\" program that cooperates on the first step, then on subsequent steps just does whatever its opponent did on the previous step. The same winner was also often obtained by natural selection; a fact widely taken to explain cooperation phenomena in evolutionary biology and the social sciences.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1104|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}</ref>\n\n===Prize-winning achievements===\n\nIn 1965, [[Reinhard Selten]] introduced his [[solution concept]] of [[Subgame perfect equilibrium|subgame perfect equilibria]], which further refined the Nash equilibrium (later he would introduce [[trembling hand perfection]] as well). In 1994 Nash, Selten and [[John Harsanyi|Harsanyi]] became [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Economics Nobel Laureates]] for their contributions to economic game theory.\n\nIn the 1970s, game theory was extensively applied in [[biology]], largely as a result of the work of [[John Maynard Smith]] and his [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. In addition, the concepts of [[correlated equilibrium]], trembling hand perfection, and [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]]<ref>Although common knowledge was first discussed by the philosopher [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] in his dissertation (and later book) ''Convention'' in the late 1960s, it was not widely considered by economists until [[Robert Aumann]]'s work in the 1970s.</ref> were introduced and analyzed.\n\nIn 2005, game theorists [[Thomas Schelling]] and [[Robert Aumann]] followed Nash, Selten and Harsanyi as Nobel Laureates. Schelling worked on dynamic models, early examples of [[evolutionary game theory]]. Aumann contributed more to the equilibrium school, introducing an equilibrium coarsening, correlated equilibrium, and developing an extensive formal analysis of the assumption of common knowledge and of its consequences.\n\nIn 2007, [[Leonid Hurwicz]], together with [[Eric Maskin]] and [[Roger Myerson]], was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics \"for having laid the foundations of [[mechanism design]] theory\". Myerson's contributions include the notion of [[proper equilibrium]], and an important graduate text: ''Game Theory, Analysis of Conflict''.<ref name=Myerson /> Hurwicz introduced and formalized the concept of [[incentive compatibility]].\n\nIn 2012, [[Alvin E. Roth]] and [[Lloyd Shapley|Lloyd S. Shapley]] were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics \"for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design\" and, in 2014, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel]] went to game theorist [[Jean Tirole]].\n\n==Game types==\n\n===Cooperative / Non-cooperative===\n{{main|Cooperative game|Non-cooperative game}}\nA game is ''cooperative'' if the players are able to form binding commitments externally enforced (e.g. through [[contract law]]). A game is ''non-cooperative'' if players cannot form alliances or if all agreements need to be [[Self-enforcing agreement|self-enforcing]] (e.g. through [[credible threat]]s).<sup>[[Cooperative game theory#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup>\n\nCooperative games are often analysed through the framework of ''cooperative game theory''''',''' which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form, the joint actions that groups take and the resulting collective payoffs. It is opposed to the traditional ''non-cooperative game theory'' which focuses on predicting individual players' actions and payoffs and analyzing [[Nash equilibria]].<sup>[[Cooperative game theory#cite note-2|[2]]][[Cooperative game theory#cite note-3|[3]]]</sup>\n\nCooperative game theory provides a high-level approach as it only describes the structure, strategies and payoffs of coalitions, whereas non-cooperative game theory also looks at how bargaining procedures will affect the distribution of payoffs within each coalition. As non-cooperative game theory is more general, cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non-cooperative game theory (the converse does not hold) provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation. While it would thus be optimal to have all games expressed under a non-cooperative framework, in many instances insufficient information is available to accurately model the formal procedures available to the players during the strategic bargaining process, or the resulting model would be of too high complexity to offer a practical tool in the real world. In such cases, cooperative game theory provides a simplified approach that allows analysis of the game at large without having to make any assumption about bargaining powers.\n\n===Symmetric / Asymmetric===\n{{Payoff matrix |Name=An asymmetric game |2L=E |2R=F |1U=E |UL=1, 2 |UR=0, 0 |1D=F |DL=0, 0 |DR=1, 2}}\n{{main|Symmetric game}}\nA symmetric game is a game where the payoffs for playing a particular strategy depend only on the other strategies employed, not on who is playing them. If the identities of the players can be changed without changing the payoff to the strategies, then a game is symmetric. Many of the commonly studied 2\u00d72 games are symmetric. The standard representations of [[Game of chicken|chicken]], the [[prisoner's dilemma]], and the [[stag hunt]] are all symmetric games. Some{{Who|date=July 2012}} scholars would consider certain asymmetric games as examples of these games as well. However, the most common payoffs for each of these games are symmetric.\n\nMost commonly studied asymmetric games are games where there are not identical strategy sets for both players. For instance, the [[ultimatum game]] and similarly the [[dictator game]] have different strategies for each player. It is possible, however, for a game to have identical strategies for both players, yet be asymmetric. For example, the game pictured to the right is asymmetric despite having identical strategy sets for both players.\n\n===Zero-sum / Non-zero-sum===\n{{Payoff matrix |Name=A zero-sum game |2L=A |2R=B |1U=A |UL=\u20131, 1 |UR=3, \u20133 |1D=B |DL=0, 0 |DR=\u20132, 2}}\n{{main|Zero-sum game}}\nZero-sum games are a special case of constant-sum games, in which choices by players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources. In zero-sum games the total benefit to all players in the game, for every combination of strategies, always adds to zero (more informally, a player benefits only at the equal expense of others).<ref>{{Cite book |title=Game Theory: Third Edition |last=Owen |first=Guillermo |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |year=1995 |isbn=0-12-531151-6 |location=Bingley |page=11}}</ref> [[Poker]] exemplifies a zero-sum game (ignoring the possibility of the house's cut), because one wins exactly the amount one's opponents lose. Other zero-sum games include [[matching pennies]] and most classical board games including [[Go (board game)|Go]] and [[chess]].\n\nMany games studied by game theorists (including the famed [[prisoner's dilemma]]) are non-zero-sum games, because the [[Outcome (game theory)|outcome]] has net results greater or less than zero. Informally, in non-zero-sum games, a gain by one player does not necessarily correspond with a loss by another.\n\nConstant-sum games correspond to activities like theft and gambling, but not to the fundamental economic situation in which there are potential [[gains from trade]]. It is possible to transform any game into a (possibly asymmetric) zero-sum game by adding a dummy player (often called \"the board\") whose losses compensate the players' net winnings.\n\n===Simultaneous / Sequential===\n{{main|Simultaneous game|Sequential game}}\n[[Simultaneous game]]s are games where both players move simultaneously, or if they do not move simultaneously, the later players are unaware of the earlier players' actions (making them ''effectively'' simultaneous). [[Sequential game]]s (or dynamic games) are games where later players have some knowledge about earlier actions. This need not be [[perfect information]] about every action of earlier players; it might be very little knowledge. For instance, a player may know that an earlier player did not perform one particular action, while s/he does not know which of the other available actions the first player actually performed.\n\nThe difference between simultaneous and sequential games is captured in the different representations discussed above. Often, [[Normal form game|normal form]] is used to represent simultaneous games, while [[Extensive form game|extensive form]] is used to represent sequential ones. The transformation of extensive to normal form is one way, meaning that multiple extensive form games correspond to the same normal form. Consequently, notions of equilibrium for simultaneous games are insufficient for reasoning about sequential games; see [[subgame perfection]].\n\nIn short, the differences between sequential and simultaneous games are as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !! Sequential !!

Pure mathematicians are not so constrained, and [[Set theory|set theorists]] in particular study games that last for infinitely many moves, with the winner (or other payoff) not known until ''after'' all those moves are completed.\n\nThe focus of attention is usually not so much on the best way to play such a game, but whether one player has a [[Determinacy#Basic notions|winning strategy]]. (It can be proven, using the [[axiom of choice]], that there are games{{spaced ndash}}even with perfect information and where the only outcomes are \"win\" or \"lose\"{{spaced ndash}}for which ''neither'' player has a winning strategy.) The existence of such strategies, for cleverly designed games, has important consequences in [[descriptive set theory]].\n\n===Discrete and continuous games===\nMuch of game theory is concerned with finite, discrete games, that have a finite number of players, moves, events, outcomes, etc. Many concepts can be extended, however. [[Continuous game]]s allow players to choose a strategy from a continuous strategy set. For instance, [[Cournot competition]] is typically modeled with players' strategies being any non-negative quantities, including fractional quantities.\n\n===Differential games===\n[[Differential game]]s such as the continuous [[Pursuit-evasion|pursuit and evasion game]] are continuous games where the evolution of the players' state variables is governed by [[differential equation]]s. The problem of finding an optimal strategy in a differential game is closely related to the [[optimal control]] theory. In particular, there are two types of strategies: the open-loop strategies are found using the [[Pontryagin's Minimum Principle|Pontryagin maximum principle]] while the closed-loop strategies are found using [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation|Bellman's Dynamic Programming]] method.\n\nA particular case of differential games are the games with a random [[time horizon]].<ref name=\"PM66\">{{ru icon}} Petrosjan, L.A. and Murzov, N.V. (1966). ''Game-theoretic problems of mechanics''. ''Litovsk. Mat. Sb.'' 6, 423\u2013433.</ref> In such games, the terminal time is a random variable with a given [[probability distribution]] function. Therefore, the players maximize the [[mathematical expectation]] of the cost function. It was shown that the modified optimization problem can be reformulated as a discounted differential game over an infinite time interval.\n\n===Evolutionary game theory===\n[[Evolutionary game theory]] studies players who adjust their strategies over time according to rules that are not necessarily rational or farsighted.<ref name=Newton2018renaissance>{{cite journal | last1=Newton | first1=Jonathan | year=2018 | title=Evolutionary Game Theory: A Renaissance | journal=Games | volume=9 | issue=2| doi=10.3390/g9020031}}</ref>  In general, the evolution of strategies over time according to such rules is modeled as a [[Markov chain]] with a state variable such as the current strategy profile or how the game has been played in the recent past. Such rules may feature imitation, optimization or survival of the fittest.\n\nIn biology, such models can represent (biological) [[evolution]], in which offspring adopt their parents' strategies and parents who play more successful strategies (i.e. corresponding to higher payoffs) have a greater number of offspring. In the social sciences, such models typically represent strategic adjustment by players who play a game many times within their lifetime and, consciously or unconsciously, occasionally adjust their strategies.{{sfnp|Webb|2007}}\n\n===Stochastic outcomes (and relation to other fields)===\nIndividual decision problems with stochastic outcomes are sometimes considered \"one-player games\". These situations are not considered game theoretical by some authors.{{By whom|date=March 2011}} They may be modeled using similar tools within the related disciplines of [[decision theory]], [[operations research]], and areas of [[artificial intelligence]], particularly [[AI planning]] (with uncertainty) and [[multi-agent system]]. Although these fields may have different motivators, the mathematics involved are substantially the same, e.g. using [[Markov decision process]]es (MDP).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nStochastic outcomes can also be modeled in terms of game theory by adding a randomly acting player who makes \"chance moves\" (\"[[Move by nature|moves by nature]]\").{{sfnp|Osborne|Rubinstein|1994}} This player is not typically considered a third player in what is otherwise a two-player game, but merely serves to provide a roll of the dice where required by the game.\n\nFor some problems, different approaches to modeling stochastic outcomes may lead to different solutions. For example, the difference in approach between MDPs and the [[Minimax|minimax solution]] is that the latter considers the worst-case over a set of adversarial moves, rather than reasoning in expectation about these moves given a fixed probability distribution. The minimax approach may be advantageous where stochastic models of uncertainty are not available, but may also be overestimating extremely unlikely (but costly) events, dramatically swaying the strategy in such scenarios if it is assumed that an adversary can force such an event to happen.<ref name=\"McMahan\">Hugh Brendan McMahan (2006), ''[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mcmahan/research/mcmahan_thesis.pdf Robust Planning in Domains with Stochastic Outcomes, Adversaries, and Partial Observability]'', CMU-CS-06-166, pp. 3\u20134</ref> (See [[Black swan theory]] for more discussion on this kind of modeling issue, particularly as it relates to predicting and limiting losses in investment banking.)\n\nGeneral models that include all elements of stochastic outcomes, adversaries, and partial or noisy observability (of moves by other players) have also been studied. The \"[[gold standard]]\" is considered to be partially observable [[stochastic game]] (POSG), but few realistic problems are computationally feasible in POSG representation.<ref name=\"McMahan\" />\n\n===Metagames===\nThese are games the play of which is the development of the rules for another game, the target or subject game. [[Metagame]]s seek to maximize the utility value of the rule set developed. The theory of metagames is related to [[mechanism design]] theory.\n\nThe term [[metagame analysis]] is also used to refer to a practical approach developed by Nigel Howard.{{sfnp|Howard|1971}} whereby a situation is framed as a strategic game in which stakeholders try to realise their objectives by means of the options available to them. Subsequent developments have led to the formulation of [[confrontation analysis]].\n\n===Pooling games===\nThese are games prevailing over all forms of society. Pooling games are repeated plays with changing payoff table in general over an experienced path and their equilibrium strategies usually take a form of evolutionary social convention and economic convention. Pooling game theory emerges to formally recognize the interaction between optimal choice in one play and the emergence of forthcoming payoff table update path, identify the invariance existence and robustness, and predict variance over time. The theory is based upon topological transformation classification of payoff table update over time to predict variance and invariance, and is also within the jurisdiction of the computational law of reachable optimality for ordered system.<ref>Wenliang Wang (2015). Pooling Game Theory and Public Pension Plan. {{isbn|978-1507658246}}.</ref>\n\n===Mean field game theory===\n[[Mean field game theory]] is the study of strategic decision making in very large populations of small interacting agents. This class of problems was considered in the economics literature by [[Boyan Jovanovic]] and [[Robert W. Rosenthal]], in the engineering literature by [[Peter E. Caines]] and by mathematician [[Pierre-Louis Lions]] and Jean-Michel Lasry.\n\n==Representation of games==\n{{see also|List of games in game theory}}\n\nThe games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects. To be fully defined, a game must specify the following elements: the [[Player (game)|''players'' of the game]], the ''information'' and ''actions'' available to each player at each decision point, and the [[Utility|''payoffs'']] for each outcome. (Eric Rasmusen refers to these four \"essential elements\" by the acronym \"PAPI\".)<ref name=\"r7\" /> A game theorist typically uses these elements, along with a [[solution concept]] of their choosing, to deduce a set of equilibrium [[Strategy (game theory)|strategies]] for each player such that, when these strategies are employed, no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. These equilibrium strategies determine an [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] to the game\u2014a stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability.\n\nMost cooperative games are presented in the characteristic function form, while the extensive and the normal forms are used to define noncooperative games.\n\n===Extensive form===\n{{main|Extensive form game}}\n[[File:Ultimatum Game Extensive Form.svg|thumb|left|An extensive form game]]\nThe extensive form can be used to formalize games with a time sequencing of moves. Games here are played on [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] (as pictured here). Here each [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|vertex]] (or node) represents a point of choice for a player. The player is specified by a number listed by the vertex. The lines out of the vertex represent a possible action for that player. The payoffs are specified at the bottom of the tree. The extensive form can be viewed as a multi-player generalization of a [[decision tree]].{{sfnp|Fudenberg|Tirole|1991|p=67}} To solve any extensive form game, [[backward induction]] must be used. It involves working backwards up the game tree to determine what a rational player would do at the last vertex of the tree, what the player with the previous move would do given that the player with the last move is rational, and so on until the first vertex of the tree is reached.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Security Studies: an Introduction (second edition) |last=Williams |first=Paul D. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn= |location=2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon, OX14 4RN |pages=55\u201356 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nThe game pictured consists of two players.  The way this particular game is structured (i.e., with sequential decision making and perfect information), ''Player 1'' \"moves\" first by choosing either ''F'' or ''U'' (Fair or Unfair). Next in the sequence, ''Player 2'', who has now seen ''Player 1''{{'}}s move, chooses to play either ''A'' or ''R''. Once ''Player 2'' has made his/ her choice, the game is considered finished and each player gets their respective payoff.  Suppose that ''Player 1'' chooses ''U'' and then ''Player 2'' chooses ''A'': ''Player 1'' then gets a payoff of \"eight\" (which in real-world terms can be interpreted in many ways, the simplest of which is in terms of money but could mean things such as eight days of vacation or eight countries conquered or even eight more opportunities to play the same game against other players) and ''Player 2'' gets a payoff of \"two\".\n\nThe extensive form can also capture simultaneous-move games and games with imperfect information. To represent it, either a dotted line connects different vertices to represent them as being part of the same information set (i.e. the players do not know at which point they are), or a closed line is drawn around them. (See example in the [[#Perfect information and imperfect information|imperfect information section]].)\n\n===Normal form===\n<!----- {| align=right border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ align=bottom |''A normal form game''\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #900;width: 90px;\" | ''Player 2 chooses left''\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #900;width: 90px;\" | ''Player 2 chooses right''\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #009;width: 90px;\" | ''Player 1 chooses top''\n| align=center | <span style=\"color: #009\">4</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">3</span>\n| align=center | <span style=\"color: #009\">-1</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">-1</span>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #009;width: 100px;\" | ''Player 1 chooses bottom''\n| align=center | <span style=\"color: #009\">0</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">0</span>\n| align=center | <span style=\"color: #009\">3</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">4</span>\n|} ----->\n{{Payoff matrix |Float=right |Width=330\n| Name = Normal form or payoff matrix of a 2-player, 2-strategy game\n| 2L = {{color|#900|Player 2<br />chooses ''Left''}}\n| 2R = {{color|#900|Player 2<br />chooses ''Right''}}\n| 1U = {{color|#009|Player 1<br />chooses ''Up''}}\n| 1D = {{color|#009|Player 1<br />chooses&nbsp;''Down''}}\n| UL = {{color|#009|'''4'''}}, {{color|#900|'''3'''}}\n| UR = {{color|#009|'''\u20131'''}}, {{color|#900|'''\u20131'''}}\n| DL = {{color|#009|'''0'''}}, {{color|#900|'''0'''}}\n| DR = {{color|#009|'''3'''}}, {{color|#900|'''4'''}}\n}}\n{{main|Normal-form game}}\nThe normal (or strategic form) game is usually represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] which shows the players, strategies, and payoffs (see the example to the right). More generally it can be represented by any function that associates a payoff for each player with every possible combination of actions. In the accompanying example there are two players; one chooses the row and the other chooses the column. Each player has two strategies, which are specified by the number of rows and the number of columns. The payoffs are provided in the interior. The first number is the payoff received by the row player (Player 1 in our example); the second is the payoff for the column player (Player 2 in our example). Suppose that Player 1 plays ''Up'' and that Player 2 plays ''Left''. Then Player 1 gets a payoff of 4, and Player 2 gets 3.\n\nWhen a game is presented in normal form, it is presumed that each player acts simultaneously or, at least, without knowing the actions of the other. If players have some information about the choices of other players, the game is usually presented in extensive form.\n\nEvery extensive-form game has an equivalent normal-form game, however the transformation to normal form may result in an exponential blowup in the size of the representation, making it computationally impractical.{{sfnp|Leyton-Brown|Shoham|2008|p=35}}\n\n===Characteristic function form===\n{{main|Cooperative game}}\nIn games that possess removable utility, separate rewards are not given; rather, the characteristic function decides the payoff of each unity. The idea is that the unity that is 'empty', so to speak, does not receive a reward at all.\n\nThe origin of this form is to be found in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's book; when looking at these instances, they guessed that when a union <math>\\mathbf{C}</math> appears, it works against the fraction\n<math>\n\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{N}}{\\mathbf{C}}\\right)\n</math>\nas if two individuals were playing a normal game. The balanced payoff of C is a basic function. Although there are differing examples that help determine coalitional amounts from normal games, not all appear that in their function form can be derived from such.\n\nFormally, a characteristic function is seen as: (N,v), where N represents the group of people and <math>v:2^N \\to \\mathbf{R}</math> is a normal utility.\n\nSuch characteristic functions have expanded to describe games where there is no removable utility.\n\n==General and applied uses==\n\nAs a method of [[applied mathematics]], game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and animal behaviors. It was initially developed in [[economics]] to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including behaviors of firms, markets, and consumers. The first use of game-theoretic analysis was by [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in 1838 with his solution of the [[Cournot competition|Cournot duopoly]]. The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well.\n\nAlthough pre-twentieth century [[Natural history|naturalists]] such as [[Charles Darwin]] made game-theoretic kinds of statements, the use of game-theoretic analysis in biology began with [[Ronald Fisher]]'s studies of animal behavior during the 1930s. This work predates the name \"game theory\", but it shares many important features with this field. The developments in economics were later applied to biology largely by [[John Maynard Smith]] in his book ''[[Evolution and the Theory of Games]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=On economic applications of evolutionary game theory|url=https://leeps.ucsc.edu/media/papers/EconAppEvolGameTheory3-1-98.pdf|journal=J Evol Econ|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to being used to describe, predict, and explain behavior, game theory has also been used to develop theories of ethical or normative behavior and to [[Decision theory#Normative and descriptive decision theory|prescribe]] such behavior.<ref name=\"Camerer2003\">[[Colin F. Camerer]] (2003).

Zalta (ed.)}}</ref>\n\n===Description and modeling===\n[[File:Centipede game.svg|thumb|300px|right|A four-stage [[centipede game]]]]\nThe primary use of game theory is to describe and [[Conceptual model#Economic models|model]] how human populations behave. Some{{Who|date=July 2012}} scholars believe that by finding the equilibria of games they can predict how actual human populations will behave when confronted with situations analogous to the game being studied. This particular view of game theory has been criticized. It is argued that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated when applied to real world situations. Game theorists usually assume players act rationally, but in practice, human behavior often deviates from this model. Game theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used in [[physics]]. Thus while their assumptions do not always hold, they can treat game theory as a reasonable scientific [[Idealization (science philosophy)|ideal]] akin to the models used by [[physicist]]s. However, empirical work has shown that in some classic games, such as the [[centipede game]], [[guess 2/3 of the average]] game, and the [[dictator game]], people regularly do not play Nash equilibria. There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments and whether the analysis of the experiments fully captures all aspects of the relevant situation.<ref>Experimental work in game theory goes by many names, [[experimental economics]], [[behavioral economics]], and [[behavioural game theory]] are several. For a recent discussion, see Colin F. Camerer (2003). ''Behavioral Game Theory: Experiments in Strategic Interaction'' ([http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7517.html description] and [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7517.html Introduction], pp.&nbsp;1\u201325).</ref>\n\nSome game theorists, following the work of [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price]], have turned to [[evolutionary game theory]] in order to resolve these issues. These models presume either no rationality or [[bounded rationality]] on the part of players. Despite the name, evolutionary game theory does not necessarily presume [[natural selection]] in the biological sense. Evolutionary game theory includes both biological as well as cultural evolution and also models of individual learning (for example, [[fictitious play]] dynamics).\n\n===Prescriptive or normative analysis===\n{{Payoff matrix |Name=The [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] | 2L=Cooperate |2R=Defect |1U=Cooperate |UL=-1, -1 |UR=-10, 0 |1D=Defect |DL=0, -10 |DR=-5, -5}}\nSome scholars, like [[Leonard Savage]],{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} see game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of human beings, but as a suggestion for how people ought to behave. Since a strategy, corresponding to a [[Nash equilibrium]] of a game constitutes one's [[best response]] to the actions of the other players \u2013 provided they are in (the same) Nash equilibrium \u2013 playing a strategy that is part of a Nash equilibrium seems appropriate.

A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the [[Nash equilibrium]]. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies.

In each of these areas, researchers have developed game-theoretic models in which the players are often voters, states, special interest groups, and politicians.\n\nEarly examples of game theory applied to political science are provided by [[Anthony Downs]]. In his book ''[[An Economic Theory of Democracy]]'',<ref>{{harvard citations|last1=Downs|year=1957}}</ref> he applies the [[Hotelling's law|Hotelling firm location model]] to the political process. In the Downsian model, political candidates commit to ideologies on a one-dimensional policy space. Downs first shows how the political candidates will converge to the ideology preferred by the median voter if voters are fully informed, but then argues that voters choose to remain rationally ignorant which allows for candidate divergence. Game Theory was applied in 1962 to the [[Cuban missile crisis]] during the presidency of John F. Kennedy.<ref>Steven J. Brams, [https://plus.maths.org/content/game-theory-and-cuban-missile-crisis Game theory and the Cuban missile crisis], Plus Magazine, 1 January 2001, accessed 31 January 2016.</ref>\n\nIt has also been proposed that game theory explains the stability of any form of political government.  Taking the simplest case of a monarchy, for example, the king, being only one person, does not and cannot maintain his authority by personally exercising physical control over all or even any significant number of his subjects.  Sovereign control is instead explained by the recognition by each citizen that all other citizens expect each other to view the king (or other established government) as the person whose orders will be followed.  Coordinating communication among citizens to replace the sovereign is effectively barred, since conspiracy to replace the sovereign is generally punishable as a crime.  Thus, in a process that can be modeled by variants of the [[prisoner's dilemma]], during periods of stability no citizen will find it rational to move to replace the sovereign, even if all the citizens know they would be better off if they were all to act collectively.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2371076 |title=Yes, Law is the Command of the Sovereign |journal= SSRN Electronic Journal|year=2013 |last1=Morrison |first1=A.

In contrast, it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders, what effect concessions will have, and if promises will be kept. Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a non-democracy.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1162/154247604323015463 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/539/ |jstor=40004867 |title=It Takes Two: An Explanation for the Democratic Peace |journal=Journal of the European Economic Association |volume=2 |page=1 |year=2004 |last1=Levy |first1=G. |last2=Razin |first2=R.}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, game theory predicts that two countries may still go to war even if their leaders are cognizant of the costs of fighting. War may result from asymmetric information; two countries may have incentives to mis-represent the amount of military resources they have on hand, rendering them unable to settle disputes agreeably without resorting to fighting. Moreover, war may arise because of commitment problems: if two countries wish to settle a dispute via peaceful means, but each wishes to go back on the terms of that settlement, they may have no choice but to resort to warfare. Finally, war may result from issue indivisibilities.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fearon |first=James D. |date=1 January 1995 |title=Rationalist Explanations for War |journal=International Organization |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=379\u2013414 |doi=10.1017/s0020818300033324 |jstor=2706903}}</ref>\n\nGame theory could also help predict a nation's responses when there is a new rule or law to be applied to that nation. One example would be Peter John Wood's (2013) research when he looked into what nations could do to help reduce climate change. Wood thought this could be accomplished by making treaties with other nations to reduce green house gas emissions. However, he concluded that this idea could not work because it would create a [[prisoner's dilemma]] to the nations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=Peter John |year=2011 |title=Climate change and game theory |url= |journal=[[Ecological Economics Review]] |volume=1219 |issue= |pages=153\u201370 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05891.x|hdl=1885/67270|bibcode=2011NYASA1219..153W}}</ref>\n\n===Biology===\n{{Payoff matrix |Name=The [[Chicken (game)#Hawk-Dove|hawk-dove]] game |2L=Hawk |2R=Dove |1U=Hawk |UL=20, 20 |UR=80, 40 |1D=Dove |DL=40, 80 |DR=60, 60}}\n{{main|Evolutionary game theory}}\n\nUnlike those in economics, the payoffs for games in [[biology]] are often interpreted as corresponding to [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. In addition, the focus has been less on [[solution concept|equilibria]] that correspond to a notion of rationality and more on ones that would be maintained by [[evolution]]ary forces. The best known equilibrium in biology is known as the ''[[evolutionarily stable strategy]]'' (ESS), first introduced in {{harv|Smith|Price|1973}}. Although its initial motivation did not involve any of the mental requirements of the [[Nash equilibrium]], every ESS is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nIn biology, game theory has been used as a model to understand many different phenomena. It was first used to explain the evolution (and stability) of the approximate 1:1 [[sex ratio]]s. {{harv|Fisher|1930}} suggested that the 1:1 sex ratios are a result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who could be seen as trying to maximize their number of grandchildren.\n\nAdditionally, biologists have used [[evolutionary game theory]] and the ESS to explain the emergence of [[animal communication]].{{sfnp|Harper|Maynard Smith|2003}} The analysis of [[signaling games]] and [[Cheap talk|other communication games]] has provided insight into the evolution of communication among animals. For example, the [[mobbing behavior]] of many species, in which a large number of prey animals attack a larger predator, seems to be an example of spontaneous emergent organization. Ants have also been shown to exhibit feed-forward behavior akin to fashion (see [[Paul Ormerod]]'s ''[[Butterfly Economics]]'').\n\nBiologists have used the [[Chicken (game)|game of chicken]] to analyze fighting behavior and territoriality.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Maynard Smith |first1=J. |title=The theory of games and the evolution of animal conflicts |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(74)90110-6 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=209\u2013221 |year=1974 |pmid=4459582 |pmc=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Maynard Smith, in the preface to ''Evolution and the Theory of Games'', \"paradoxically, it has turned out that game theory is more readily applied to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which it was originally designed\". Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many seemingly incongruous phenomena in nature.<ref name=\"stan-egt\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-evolutionary/ Evolutionary Game Theory (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]. Plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved on 3 January 2013.</ref>\n\nOne such phenomenon is known as [[Altruism in animals|biological altruism]]. This is a situation in which an organism appears to act in a way that benefits other organisms and is detrimental to itself. This is distinct from traditional notions of altruism because such actions are not conscious, but appear to be evolutionary adaptations to increase overall fitness. Examples can be found in species ranging from vampire bats that regurgitate blood they have obtained from a night's hunting and give it to group members who have failed to feed, to worker bees that care for the queen bee for their entire lives and never mate, to [[vervet monkey]]s that warn group members of a predator's approach, even when it endangers that individual's chance of survival.<ref name=\"qudzyh\">[http://www.seop.leeds.ac.uk/entries/altruism-biological/ Biological Altruism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]. Seop.leeds.ac.uk. Retrieved on 3 January 2013.</ref> All of these actions increase the overall fitness of a group, but occur at a cost to the individual.\n\nEvolutionary game theory explains this altruism with the idea of [[kin selection]]. Altruists discriminate between the individuals they help and favor relatives. [[Hamilton's rule]] explains the evolutionary rationale behind this selection with the equation {{Math|c < b &times; r}}, where the cost {{varserif|c}} to the altruist must be less than the benefit {{varserif|b}} to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness {{varserif|r}}. The more closely related two organisms are causes the incidences of altruism to increase because they share many of the same alleles. This means that the altruistic individual, by ensuring that the alleles of its close relative are passed on through survival of its offspring, can forgo the option of having offspring itself because the same number of alleles are passed on. For example, helping a sibling (in diploid animals) has a coefficient of \u00bd, because (on average) an individual shares \u00bd of the alleles in its sibling's offspring. Ensuring that enough of a sibling's offspring survive to adulthood precludes the necessity of the altruistic individual producing offspring.<ref name=\"qudzyh\" /> The coefficient values depend heavily on the scope of the playing field; for example if the choice of whom to favor includes all genetic living things, not just all relatives, we assume the discrepancy between all humans only accounts for approximately 1% of the diversity in the playing field, a co-efficient that was \u00bd in the smaller field becomes 0.995. Similarly if it is considered that information other than that of a genetic nature (e.g. epigenetics, religion, science, etc.) persisted through time the playing field becomes larger still, and the discrepancies smaller.\n\n===Computer science and logic===\nGame theory has come to play an increasingly important role in [[logic]] and in [[computer science]]. Several logical theories have a basis in [[game semantics]]. In addition, computer scientists have used games to model [[interactive computation]]s. Also, game theory provides a theoretical basis to the field of [[multi-agent system]]s.\n\nSeparately, game theory has played a role in [[online algorithm]]s; in particular, the [[k-server problem]], which has in the past been referred to as ''games with moving costs'' and ''request-answer games''.<ref>{{harvard citations |last1=Ben David |last2=Borodin |last3=Karp |last4=Tardos |last5=Wigderson |year=1994}}</ref> [[Yao's principle]] is a game-theoretic technique for proving [[Upper and lower bounds|lower bounds]] on the [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] of [[randomized algorithm]]s, especially online algorithms.\n\nThe emergence of the internet has motivated the development of algorithms for finding equilibria in games, markets, computational auctions, peer-to-peer systems, and security and information markets. [[Algorithmic game theory]]<ref name=\"algorithmic-game\" /> and within it [[algorithmic mechanism design]]<ref name=r11 /> combine computational [[algorithm design]] and analysis of [[complex system]]s with economic theory.<ref name=r12 />\n\n===Philosophy===\n{{Payoff matrix |Name=[[Stag hunt]] | 2L=Stag |2R=Hare |1U=Stag |UL=3, 3 |UR=0, 2 |1D=Hare |DL=2, 0 |DR=2, 2}}\nGame theory has been put to several uses in [[philosophy]]. Responding to two papers by {{harvard citations|txt=yes|first=W.V.O.|last=Quine|author1-link=Willard Van Orman Quine|year=1960|year2=1967}}, {{Harvtxt|Lewis|1969}} used game theory to develop a philosophical account of [[Convention (norm)|convention]]. In so doing, he provided the first analysis of [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] and employed it in analyzing play in [[coordination game]]s. In addition, he first suggested that one can understand [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] in terms of [[signaling games]]. This later suggestion has been pursued by several philosophers since Lewis.<ref>({{Harvtxt|Skyrms|1996}}, {{harvard citations |txt=yes |last1=Grim |last2=Kokalis |last3=Alai-Tafti |last4=Kilb |last5=St Denis |year=2004}}).</ref> Following {{Harvtxt|Lewis|1969}} game-theoretic account of conventions, Edna Ullmann-Margalit (1977) and [[Cristina Bicchieri|Bicchieri]] (2006) have developed theories of [[social norms]] that define them as Nash equilibria that result from transforming a mixed-motive game into a coordination game.<ref>{{citation |first=E. |last=Ullmann-Margalit |title=The Emergence of Norms |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1977 |isbn=0198244118}}</ref><ref>{{citation |first=C. |last=Bicchieri |title=The Grammar of Society: the Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0521573726}}</ref>\n\nGame theory has also challenged philosophers to think in terms of interactive [[epistemology]]: what it means for a collective to have common beliefs or knowledge, and what are the consequences of this knowledge for the social outcomes resulting from the interactions of agents. Philosophers who have worked in this area include Bicchieri (1989, 1993),<ref>{{citation |title=Self-Refuting Theories of Strategic Interaction: A Paradox of Common Knowledge |journal=Erkenntnis |volume=30 |issue=1\u20132 |year=1989 |pages=69\u201385 |doi=10.1007/BF00184816 |last1=Bicchieri |first1=Cristina}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last1=Bicchieri |first1=Cristina |author1-link=Cristina Bicchieri |title=Rationality and Coordination |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-57444-7 |year=1993}}</ref> [[Brian Skyrms|Skyrms]] (1990),<ref>{{citation |title=The Dynamics of Rational Deliberation |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1990 |isbn=067421885X}}</ref> and [[Robert Stalnaker|Stalnaker]] (1999).<ref>{{citation |chapter=Knowledge, Belief, and Counterfactual Reasoning in Games |editor-first=Cristina |editor-last=Bicchieri |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Jeffrey |editor3-first=Brian |editor3-last=Skyrms |title=The Logic of Strategy |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |isbn=0195117158}}</ref>\n\nIn [[ethics]], some (most notably David Gauthier, Gregory Kavka, and Jean Hampton) {{Who|date=July 2012}} authors have attempted to pursue [[Thomas Hobbes]]' project of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the [[prisoner's dilemma]] present an apparent conflict between morality and self-interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an important component of this project. This general strategy is a component of the general [[social contract]] view in [[political philosophy]] (for examples, see {{Harvtxt|Gauthier|1986}} and {{Harvtxt|Kavka |1986}}).<ref>For a more detailed discussion of the use of game theory in ethics, see the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-ethics/ game theory and ethics].</ref>\n\nOther authors have attempted to use [[evolutionary game theory]] in order to explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding animal behaviors. These authors look at several games including the prisoner's dilemma, [[stag hunt]], and the [[Nash bargaining game]] as providing an explanation for the emergence of attitudes about morality (see, e.g., {{harvard citations|txt=yes|last=Skyrms|year=1996|year2=2004}} and {{harvard citations|txt=yes|last1=Sober|last2=Wilson|year=1999}}).\n\n==In popular culture==\n* Based on [[A Beautiful Mind (book)|the 1998 book]] by [[Sylvia Nasar]],<ref>Nasar, Sylvia (1998) ''A Beautiful Mind'', Simon & Schuster. {{isbn|0-684-81906-6}}.</ref> the life story of game theorist and mathematician [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]] was turned into the 2001 [[biopic]] ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'', starring [[Russell Crowe]] as Nash.<ref>Singh, Simon (14 June 1998)  [https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/06/14/reviews/980614.14singht.html \"Between Genius and Madness\"], New York Times.</ref>\n* The 1959 [[military science fiction]] novel ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' by [[Robert A.

For example, nuclear deterrence depends on the threat to retaliate catastrophically if a nuclear attack is detected. A game theorist might argue that such threats can fail to be ''credible'', in the sense that they can lead to [[Subgame perfect equilibrium|subgame imperfect equilibria]]. The movie takes this idea one step further, with the Russians irrevocably committing to a catastrophic nuclear response without making the threat public.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n* The 1980s [[power pop]] band [[Game Theory (band)|Game Theory]] was founded by singer/songwriter [[Scott Miller (pop musician)|Scott Miller]], who described the band's name as alluding to \"the study of calculating the most appropriate action given an adversary... to give yourself the minimum amount of failure.\"<ref name=intpacsun>{{cite news|last=Guzman|first=Rafer|title=Star on hold: Faithful following, meager sales|date=March 6, 1996|journal=[[Pacific Sun (newspaper)|Pacific Sun]]}} {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106223809/http://www.loudfamily.com/old/intpacsun.html |date=2013-11-06 |title=Copy of interview }}.{{cbignore}}</ref>\n* ''[[Liar Game]]'', a 2005 Japanese [[manga]] and 2007 television series, presents the main characters in each episode with a game or problem that is typically drawn from game theory, as demonstrated by the strategies applied by the characters.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Applied ethics]]\n* [[Chainstore paradox]]\n* [[Collective intentionality]]\n* [[Combinatorial game theory]]\n* [[Confrontation analysis]]\n* [[Glossary of game theory]]\n* [[Intra-household bargaining]]\n* [[Kingmaker scenario]]\n* [[Parrondo's paradox]]\n* [[Precautionary principle]]\n* [[Quantum game theory]]\n* [[Quantum refereed game]]\n* [[Rationality]]\n* [[Risk management]]\n* [[Mechanism design|Reverse game theory]]\n* [[Self-confirming equilibrium]]\n* [[Zermelo's theorem (game theory)|Zermelo's theorem]]\n* [[Tragedy of the commons]]\n* [[Law and economics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Lists'''\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n* [[List of emerging technologies]]\n* [[List of games in game theory]]\n* [[Outline of artificial intelligence]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em\n | refs = \n<ref name=r1>\u2022 At [[JEL classification codes#Mathematical and quantitative methods JEL: C Subcategories|JEL:C7]] of the ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]'' classification codes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2022 [[Robert Aumann|R.J.

The social welfare system provides for [[universal health care]], [[unemployment compensation]], [[child benefits]] and other social programmes. Due to Germany's ageing population and struggling economy, the welfare system came under a lot of strain in the 1990s.

This has been attributed to the fact that there was a \"demographic shock\" (people not only had fewer children, they also were less likely to marry or divorce after the end of the GDR) the biographic options of the citizens of the former GDR had increased. Young motherhood seemed to be less attractive and the age of the first birth rose sharply.<ref name=\"berlin-institut.org\"/>\n\nIn the following years, the TFR in the East Germany started rising again, surpassing 1.0 in 1997 and 1.3 in 2004, reaching the West's TFR in 2007 (1.37). In 2010, the East's fertility rate (1.459) clearly exceeded that of the West (1.385), while Germany's overall TFR has risen to 1.393, the highest value since 1990<ref name=\"destatis.de\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/projects_publications/publications_1904/mpidr_working_papers/east_germany_overtakes_west_germany_recent_trends_in_order_specific_fertility_dynamics__4016.htm|title=East Germany overtakes West Germany: recent trends in order-specific fertility dynamics|website=Demogr.mpg.de|accessdate=2017-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213632/http://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/projects_publications/publications_1904/mpidr_working_papers/east_germany_overtakes_west_germany_recent_trends_in_order_specific_fertility_dynamics__4016.htm|archive-date=23 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> - which was still far below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 and the birth rates seen under communism.

In 2007 the so-called \"Elterngeld\" was introduced. According to [[Christoph Butterwegge]] the Elterngeld was meant to \"motivate highly educated women to have more children\", the poor on the other hand were disadvantaged by the Elterngeld, receiving now fewer child benefits than the middle classes.<ref>Christoph Butterwegge, Michael Klundt, Matthias Zeng: Kinderarmut in Ost- und Westdeutschland. 2., erweiterte und aktualisierte Auflage.

Persons holding a college degree, persons older than 30 years and parents with only one child benefited the most. Single parents and young parents did not benefit\n* Fathers are becoming more involved in parenting, and 28% of them now take some time off their jobs (3.3 months on average) when their children are born.\n* Mothers are more likely to work and as a result less likely to be economically deprived than they used to.\n* The birth rate of college educated women has risen.\n\nIn the new federal states the birth rate of college educated women is now higher than that of those without college degrees. Differences in value priorities and the better availability of childcare in the eastern states are discussed as a possible reason.<ref>Bundesintitut f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsforschung 2012.

It did so by propagandizing the opinion that every educated woman should \"present at least one child to socialism\" and also by financially rewarding its more educated citizen to become parents. The government especially tried to persuade students to become parents while still in college and it was quite successful in doing so. In 1986 38% of all women, who were about to graduate from college, were mothers of at least one child and additional 14% were pregnant and 43% of all men, who were about to graduate from college, were fathers of at least one child. There was a sharp decline in the birth rate and especially in the birth rate of the educated after the fall of the Berlin wall. Nowadays,{{When|date=March 2015}} 5% of those about to graduate from college are parents.\n\nThe more educated a Western German mother aged 40 to 75 was in 2008, the less likely she was to have a big family.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"| Percent of Western German '''mothers''' having 1, 2 and 3 or more children by educational attainment\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:160px; vertical-align:top;\"| number of children\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:160px; vertical-align:top;\"| compulsory education\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:160px; vertical-align:top;\"| intermediary education\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:160px; vertical-align:top;\"| highest education\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| one child    || 22 || 30 || 31\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| two children  || 39 || 48 || 48\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| three or more children || 39 || 22 || 21\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref name=\"Statistisches Bundesamt 2008. p.29\">Statistisches Bundesamt.

The figures presented here are based on this definition only.\n\nIn 2010, 2.3 million families with children under 18 years were living in Germany, in which at least one parent had foreign roots. They represented 29% of the total of 8.1 million families with minor children. Compared with 2005&nbsp;\u2013 the year when the microcensus started to collect detailed information on the population with a migrant background&nbsp;\u2013 the proportion of migrant families has risen by 2 percentage points.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=https://www.destatis.de/EN/Publications/STATmagazin/Population/2012_03/2012_03MigrantBackground.html|title=Publikation - STATmagazin - Population - Families with a migrant background: traditional values count - Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)|date=27 August 2012|work=destatis.de|accessdate=23 October 2015}}</ref> In 2015, 36% children under 5 years old had migrant background.<ref>[https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2016/09/PD16_327_122.html Bev\u00f6lkerung mit Migrationshintergrund auf Rekordniveau]</ref>(number includes ethnic German repatriates)\n\nMost of the families with a migrant background live in the western part of Germany.

Berlin) where it stood at 15%.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nFamilies with a migrant background more often have three or more minor children in the household than families without a migrant background. In 2010, about 15% of the families with a migrant background contained three or more minor children, as compared with just 9% of the families without a migrant background.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn 2009, 3.0 million of the persons of immigrant background had Turkish roots, 2.9 million had their roots in the successor states of the [[Soviet Union]] (including a large number of [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|Russian-speaking ethnic Germans]]), 1.5 million had their roots in the successor states of [[Yugoslavia]] and 1.5 million had Polish roots.<ref>Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr politische Bildung: \"Die soziale Situation in Deutschland&nbsp;\u2014 Bev\u00f6lkerung mit Migrationshintergrund I\"</ref>\n\nIn 2008, 18.4% of Germans of any age group and 30% of German children had at least one parent born abroad.

There is a [[Denmark|Danish]] minority (about 50,000, according to government sources) in the northern-most state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. Eastern and Northern [[Frisians]] live at Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of [[Lower Saxony]]. They are part of a wider community ([[Frisia]]) stretching from Germany to the northern [[Netherlands]]. The [[Sorbs]], a [[Slavic people]] with about 60,000 members (according to government sources), are in the [[Lusatia]] region of [[Free State of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Brandenburg]]. They are the last remnants of the Slavs that lived in central and eastern Germany since the 7th century to have kept their traditions and not been completely integrated into the wider German nation.\n\nUntil [[World War II]] the [[Poles]] were recognized as one of the national minorities. In 1924 the [[Union of Poles in Germany]] had initiated cooperation between all national minorities in Germany under the umbrella organization [[Association of National Minorities in Germany]]. Some of the union members wanted the Polish communities in easternmost Germany (now [[Poland]]) to join the newly established Polish nation after [[World War I]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Even before the German invasion of Poland, leading anti-Nazi members of the Polish minority were deported to concentration camps; some were executed at the Pia\u015bnica murder site. Minority rights for Poles in Germany were revoked by Hermann G\u00f6ring's World War II decree of 27 February 1940, and their property was confiscated.\n\nAfter the war ended, the German government did not re-implement national minority rights for ethnic Poles.  The reason for this is that the areas of Germany which formerly had a native Polish minority were annexed to Poland and the Soviet Union, while almost all of the native German populations (formerly the ethnic majority) in these areas [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|subsequently fled or were expelled by force]].  With the mixed German-Polish territories now lost, the German government subsequently regarded ethnic Poles residing in what remained of Germany as immigrants, just like any other ethnic population with a recent history of arrival.  In contrast, [[Germans in Poland|Germans living in Poland]] are recognized as national minority and have granted seats in Polish Parliament. It must be said, however, that an overwhelming number of Germans in Poland have centuries-old historical ties to the lands they now inhabit, whether from living in territory that once belonged to the German state, or from centuries-old communities. In contrast, most Poles in present-day Germany are recent immigrants, though there are some communities which have been present since the 19th and perhaps even the 18th centuries.  Despite protests by some in the older Polish-German communities, and despite Germany being now a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Germany has so far refused to re-implement minority rights for ethnic Poles, based on the fact that almost all areas of historically mixed German-Polish heritage (where the minority rights formerly existed) are no longer part of Germany and because the vast majority of ethnic Poles now residing in Germany are recent immigrants.\n\n[[Romani people|Roma people]] have been in Germany since the [[Middle Ages]]. They were persecuted by the [[Nazis]], and thousands of Roma living in Germany were killed by the Nazi regime. Nowadays, they are spread all over Germany, mostly living in major cities. It is difficult to estimate their exact number, as the German government counts them as \"persons without migrant background\" in their statistics. There are also many assimilated Sinti and Roma. A vague figure given by the German Department of the Interior is about 70,000. In the late 1990s, many Roma moved to Germany from [[Kosovo]]. In contrast to the old-established Roma population, the majority of them do not have German citizenship, they are classified as [[immigrants]] or [[refugee]]s.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079037-0017, Lager Friedland, Familie aus Sibirien.jpg|thumb|left|A family of so-called \"Sp\u00e4taussiedler\" (repatriates of ethnic German origin), because the parents were born abroad they will be counted as \"persons with immigrant background\"]]\n\nAfter World War II, 14 million ethnic Germans [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|were expelled]] from the [[Former eastern territories of Germany|eastern territories of Germany]] and homelands outside the former German Empire. The accommodation and integration of these ''[[Heimatvertriebene]]'' in the remaining part of Germany, in which many cities and millions of apartments had been destroyed, was a major effort in the post-war occupation zones and later states of Germany.\n\nSince the 1960s, ethnic Germans from the [[People's Republic of Poland]] and [[Soviet Union]] (especially from [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]]), have come to Germany. During the time of [[Perestroika]], and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of immigrants increased heavily. Some of these immigrants are of mixed ancestry. During the 10-year period between 1987 and 2001, a total of 1,981,732 ethnic Germans from the FSU immigrated to Germany, along with more than a million of their non-German relatives. After 1997, however ethnic Slavs or those belonging to Slavic-Germanic mixed origins outnumbered these with only Germanic descent amongst the immigrants. The total number of people currently living in Germany having FSU connection is around 4 to 4.5 million (Including Germans, Slavs, Jews and those of mixed origins), out of that more than 50% is of German descent.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040321130252/http://www.iza.org/iza/en/papers/transatlantic/1_locher.pdf]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odessa3.org/journal/pohl.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Deportation and Destruction of the German Minority in the USSR|author=J.

During the 1960s and 1970s, agreements were signed with the governments of [[Turkey]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]] to help Germany overcome its severe labour shortage.\n\nAs of 2012, the largest sources of net immigration to Germany are other European countries, most importantly [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and [[Greece]]; notably, in the case of [[Turkey]], German Turks moving to Turkey slightly outnumber new immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/Migrationsberichte/migrationsbericht-2012.pdf?__blob=publicationFile|title=See page 21 of this report|website=Bamf.de|accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, there were 476,649 asylum applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2016/01/asylantraege-dezember-2015.html|title=2015: Mehr Asylantr\u00e4ge in Deutschland als jemals zuvor|website=Bundesministerium des Innern|accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{Main article|Education in Germany}}\n[[File:MSM-sporthalle.jpg|thumb|Cadets of the German Navy exercising in front of one of the gyms of Germany's naval officers school, the Marineschule M\u00fcrwik.]]\n\nResponsibility for educational oversight in Germany lies primarily with the individual [[States of Germany|federated states]]. Since the 1960s, a reform movement has attempted to unify secondary education into a ''Gesamtschule'' ([[comprehensive school]]); several West German states later simplified their school systems to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called ''Duale Ausbildung'' (\"dual education\") allows pupils in [[vocational training]] to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.<ref name=\"ED\"/>\n\nOptional [[kindergarten]] education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for at least nine years.

While some German schools such as the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] and the [[Realschule]] have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have such requirements. They offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well, general education classes for average students, and remedial courses for those who aren't doing that well. In most cases students attending a Gesamtschule may graduate with the [[Hauptschulabschluss]], the [[Realschulabschluss]] or the [[Abitur]] depending on how well they did in school.\nThe percentage of students attending a Gesamtschule varies by [[States of Germany|Bundesland]].

While speaking a dialect outside its native region might be frowned upon, in their native regions some dialects can be spoken by all social classes. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Nevertheless, partly due to the prevalence of Standard German in media, the use of dialects has declined over the past century, especially in the younger population.\n\nThe social status of different German dialects can vary greatly. The Alemannic and Bavarian dialects of the south are positively valued by their speakers and can be used in almost all social circumstances. The Saxonian and Thuringian dialects have less prestige and are subject to derision. While Bavarian and Alemannic have kept much of their distinctiveness, the Middle German dialects, which are closer to Standard German, have lost some of their distinctive lexical and grammatical features and tend to be only pronunciation variants of Standard German.\n\n===Low Saxon dialects===\n\n[[Low German|Low Saxon]] is officially recognized as a language on its own, but despite this fact, there's little official action taken on fostering the language. Historically one third of Germany's territory and population was Low Saxon speaking. No data was ever collected on the actual number of speakers, but today the number of speakers ranges around 5 million persons. Despite this relatively high number of speakers there is very little coverage in the media (mostly on [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] TV, no regular programming) and very little education in or on the language. The language is not fixed as part of the school curriculum and Low Saxon is used as a medium of instruction in one school only in the whole Germany (as a \"model project\" in primary school sided by education in Standard German). As a consequence the younger generation refused to adopt the native language of their parents. Language prevalence dropped from more than 90% (depending on the exact region) in the 1930s to less than 5% today. This accounts for a massive intergenerational gap in language use. Older people regularly use the language and take private initiative to maintain the language, but the lack of innovative potential of the younger generation hinders language maintenance. The language too has an own literature (around 150 published books every year) and there are many theatres (mostly lay stages, but some professional ones, like for example [[Ohnsorg-Theater]]).\n\nUse of Low Saxon is mainly restricted to use among acquaintances, like family members, neighbours and friends. A meeting of a village council can be held almost completely in Low Saxon if all participants know each other (as long as written protocols are written in Standard German), but a single foreigner can make the whole switching to Standard German.\n\nThe Low Saxon dialects are different in their status too. There's a north-south gradient in language maintenance. The Southern dialects of Westfalian, Eastfalian and Brandenburgish have had much stronger speaker losses, than the northern coastal dialects of Northern Low Saxon. While Eastfalian has lost speakers to Standard German, Westfalian has lost speakers to Standard German and Standard German based regiolect of the Rhine-Ruhr area. Brandenburgish speakers mostly switched to the Standard German-based regiolect of Berlin. Brandenburgish is almost completely replaced by the Berlin regiolect. Northern Low Saxon speakers switched mostly to pure Standard German.\n\n===Foreign languages===\nEnglish is the most common foreign language and almost universally taught by the secondary level; it is also taught at elementary level in some states. Other commonly-taught languages are French, [[Italian language|Italian]], Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Russian language|Russian]]. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is taught in states bordering the [[Netherlands]], and [[Polish language|Polish]] in the eastern states bordering [[Poland]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]] are part of the [[Classics|classical education]] syllabus offered in many secondary schools.\n\nAccording to a 2004 survey, two-thirds of Germany's citizens have at least basic knowledge of English.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} About 20% consider themselves to be competent speakers of French, followed by speakers of Russian (7%), Italian (6.1%), and Spanish (5.6%). The relatively high number of Russian speakers is a result of massive immigration from the former Soviet Union to Germany for almost 10 consecutive years, plus its having been learned in school by many older former East Germans.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Germany|European Union}}\n* [[Germans]]\n* [[Census in Germany]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=fn|refs=\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|Demographie Deutschlands}}\n* [http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/EN/Navigation/Homepage__NT.psml Homepage of the Federal Statistical Office Germany (in English)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040901002136/http://www.histat.gesis.org/ German demographics in Online-Databank HISTAT]  (in German, Registration needed)\n* [http://www.goethe.de/ges/soz/dos/dos/age/enindex.htm Dossier \"The Aging Society\" of the Goethe-Institut]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090226110802/http://knowledge.allianz.com/en/globalissues/demographic_profiles/germany/germany_demographic_profile.html Demographic Profile Germany: United in Decline] Allianz Knowledge\n\n{{Germany topics}}\n{{Demographics of Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demographics Of Germany}}\n[[Category:Demographics of Germany| ]]", "sha1": "2zg2pb2y5c04e0b3btuge2g746i5hz6"}}, {"title": "Economy of Germany", "ns": "0", "id": "11930", "revision": {"id": "866615758", "parentid": "866613448", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T12:53:36Z", "contributor": {"username": "AnomieBOT", "id": "7611264"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Dating maintenance tags: {{By whom?}} {{How?}} {{When?}}", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use British English|date=December 2014}} \n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2014}}\n{{Infobox economy\n|country         = Germany\n|image           = Skyline Frankfurt am Main 2015.jpg \n|gdp             = $4.029 trillion (nominal; 2018)<ref name=\"IMF database 2018\">{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=37&pr.y=7&sy=2016&ey=2018&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=134&s=NGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPPC&grp=0&a= |title=World Economic Outlook Database, October 2018, Germany |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]] |date=October 2018 |accessdate=19 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428020243/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=37&pr.y=7&sy=2016&ey=2018&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=134&s=NGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPPC&grp=0&a= |archivedate=28 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><br/>$4.379 trillion (PPP; 2018)<ref name=\"IMF database 2018\" />\n|gdp rank        = {{hlist|[[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|4th (nominal)]]|[[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|5th (PPP)]]}}\n|image_size      = 300px \n|caption         = [[Frankfurt]], the [[financial capital]] of Germany\n|currency        = [[Euro]] (EUR) = 1.17 [[USD]] \n|year            = 1 January \u2013 31 December   \n|organs          = [[European Union|EU]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]\n|growth          = 2% (2018)<ref name=\"Mint\">{{citeweb|url=http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLDl/DEU|title=Real GDP growth; Annual percent change|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903115059/http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLDl/DEU|archivedate=3 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>   \n|per capita      = $48,669 (nominal; 2018)<ref name=\"IMF database 2018\"/><br/>$52,896 (PPP; 2018)<ref name=\"IMF database 2018\"/>\n|per capita rank = {{hlist|[[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|17th (nominal)]]|[[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|18th (PPP)]]}}\n|sectors         = agriculture: 0.6%, industry: 30.1%, services: 69.3% (2017 est.)<ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html |title=Germany |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) |year =2018 |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref>\n|components          = Household consumption: 53.7%<br />Government consumption: 19.9%<br />Investment in fixed capital: 20.1%<br />Investment in inventories: -1%<br />Exports of goods and services: 47.3%<br />Imports of goods and services: -40% (2017 est.)<ref name=\"cia.gov\"/>\n|inflation       = {{increaseNegative}} 2% (2018)<ref name=\"destatis.de\">{{cite web|url=https://destatis.de/EN/Homepage.html|title=Homepage -

Over time, other German states joined the customs union and started linking their railroads, which began to connect the corners of Germany together. The growth of free trade and of a rail system across Germany intensified economic development which opened up new markets for local products, created a pool of [[middle management | middle managers]],{{how?|date=October 2018}} increased the demand for engineers, architects and skilled machinists, and stimulated investments in coal and iron.<ref>Richard Tilly, \"Germany: 1815\u20131870\" in Rondo Cameron, ed.

The establishment of the empire inherently presented Europe with the reality of a new populous and industrializing polity possessing a considerable, and undeniably increasing, economic and diplomatic presence. The influence of French economic principles produced important institutional reforms in Germany, including the abolition of feudal restrictions on the sale of large landed estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in the cities, and the introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law. Nonetheless, political decisions about the economy of the empire were still largely controlled by a [[Marriage of Iron and Rye|coalition of \"rye and iron\"]], that is the [[Prussian Junker]] landowners of the east and the [[Ruhr]] heavy industry of the west.<ref>Cornelius Torp, \"The \"Coalition of 'Rye and Iron'\" under the Pressure of Globalization: A Reinterpretation of Germany's Political Economy before 1914,\" ''Central European History'' Sept 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 401-427</ref>\n\nRegarding politics and society, between 1881 and 1889 Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] promoted laws that provided [[social insurance]] and improved working conditions.

Rowohlt Berlin, 2010</ref>\n\nGermany is an advocate of closer European economic and political integration. Its commercial policies are increasingly determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and EU [[single market]] legislation. Germany introduced the common European currency, the euro on 1 January 1999. Its monetary policy is set by the [[European Central Bank]] in Frankfurt.\n\nThe southern states (\"Bundesl\u00e4nder\"), especially Bayern, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hessen, are economically stronger than the northern states. One of Germany's traditionally strongest (and at the same time oldest) economic regions is the [[Ruhr area]] in the west, between [[Duisburg]] and [[Dortmund]]. 27 of the country's 100 largest companies are located there. In recent years, however, the area, whose economy is based on natural resources and heavy industry, has seen a substantial rise in unemployment (2010: 8.7%).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe economy of [[Bayern]] and [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], the states with the lowest number of unemployed people (2018: 2.7%, 3.1%), on the other hand, is based on high-value products. Important sectors are automobiles, electronics, aerospace and biomedicine, among others. Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg is an industrial center especially for automobile and machine building industry and the home of brands like Mercedes-Benz (Daimler), Porsche and Bosch.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWith the reunification on 3 October 1990, Germany began the major task of reconciling the economic systems of the two former republics. Interventionist economic planning ensured gradual development in eastern Germany up to the level of former West Germany, but the [[standard of living]] and annual income remains significantly higher in western German states.<ref name=\"FR\">Berg, S., Winter, S., Wassermann, A.

Agriculture is extremely productive, and Germany is able to cover 90% of its nutritional needs with domestic production. Germany is the third largest agricultural producer in the European Union after France and Italy. Germany\u2019s principal agricultural products are potatoes, wheat, barley, sugar beets, fruit, and cabbages.\n\nDespite the country\u2019s high level of industrialization, almost one-third of its territory is covered by forest.<ref>[http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/2000/Germany.htm ''31.7%&nbsp;\u2014or about 11,076,000 hectares\u2014 of Germany is forested''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221210403/http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/2000/Germany.htm |date=21 February 2010 }}, mongabay.com, 2005.</ref> The forestry industry provides for about two-thirds of domestic consumption of wood and wood products, so Germany is a net importer of these items.\n\n[[File:Garzweiler.strip.mine.jpg|left|thumb|[[Strip mining]] lignite at [[Tagebau Garzweiler]] near [[Grevenbroich]], Germany.]]\n\nThe German soil is relatively poor in raw materials. Only [[lignite]] (brown coal) and [[potash]] salt (Kalisalz) are available in significant quantities. However, the former GDR's [[Wismut (mining company)|Wismut]] mining company produced a total of 230,400 tonnes of uranium between 1947 and 1990 and made East Germany the fourth largest producer of uranium ore worldwide (largest in USSR's sphere of control) at the time. Oil, natural gas and other resources are, for the most part, imported from other countries.<ref name=\"G\u00fcrtler, Detlef 2010\">G\u00fcrtler, Detlef: Wirtschaftsatlas Deutschland. Rowohlt Berlin, 2010.</ref>\n\nPotash salt is mined in the center of the country ([[Niedersachsen]], [[Sachsen-Anhalt]] and [[Thuringia|Th\u00fcringen]]). The most important producer is [[K+S AG]] (formerly Kali und Salz AG).<ref name=\"G\u00fcrtler, Detlef 2010\"/>\n\nGermany's bituminous coal deposits were created more than 300 million years ago from swamps which extended from the present-day [[South England]], over the [[Ruhr area]] to [[Poland]]. Lignite deposits developed in a similar way, but during a later period, about 66 million years ago. Because the wood is not yet completely transformed into coal, brown coal contains less energy than bituminous coal.<ref name=\"G\u00fcrtler, Detlef 2010\"/>\n\nLignite is extracted in the extreme western and eastern parts of the country, mainly in [[Nordrhein-Westfalen]], [[Sachsen]] and [[Brandenburg]]. Considerable amounts are burned in [[coal plants]] near to the mining areas, to produce electricity. Transporting lignite over far distances is not economically feasible, therefore the plants are located practically next to the extraction sites. [[Bituminous coal]] is mined in Nordrhein-Westfalen and Saarland. Most power plants burning bituminous coal operate on imported material, therefore the plants are located not only near to the mining sites, but throughout the country.<ref name=\"G\u00fcrtler, Detlef 2010\"/>\n\n===Industry===\n{{See also|Mittelstand}}\n[[File:BASF1.jpg|thumb|The world's largest coherent chemistry plant [[BASF]] in [[Ludwigshafen]].]]\n\nIndustry and construction accounted for 30.1% of gross domestic product in 2017, and employed 24.2% of the workforce.<ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> Germany excels in the production of [[automobiles]], [[machinery]], electrical equipment and chemicals.

The country's most important waterway is the river [[Rhine]]. The largest port is that of [[Hamburg]]. [[Frankfurt Airport]] is a major international airport and European transport hub. [[Air travel]] is used for greater distances within Germany but faces competition from the state-owned [[Deutsche Bahn]]'s rail network. High-speed trains called [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] connect cities for passenger travel with speeds up to 300&nbsp;km/h. Many German cities have [[Rapid transit in Germany|rapid transit]] systems and [[public transport]] is available in most areas. Buses have historically only played a marginal role in long distance passenger service, as all routes directly competing with rail services were technically outlawed by a law dating to 1935. Only in 2012 was this law officially amended and thus; a long distance bus market has also emerged in Germany since then.\n\nSince [[German reunification]] substantial effort has been made to improve and expand transport infrastructure in what was formerly [[East Germany]].<ref>[http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_80758/Content/DE/Artikel/2001-2006/2006/09/2006-09-13-gute-infrastruktur-in-den-neuen-laendern.html bundesregierung.de] - The federal government says 40% of \u20ac164,000,000,000 spent on transport infrastructure where spent in the eastern part</ref>\n\n'''''Verkehrsmittel and Verkehrszeichen''''' - [[Road signs in Germany|Transportation Signs in Germany]] are available here in German and English.\n\n==Road and automotive transport==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Autobahnen in Deutschland.svg|thumb|Map of the German autobahn network]]\nThe volume of traffic in Germany, especially goods transportation, is at a very high level due to its central location in Europe.\nIn the past few decades, much of the freight traffic shifted from rail to road, which led the [[German Government|Federal Government]] to introduce a motor toll for trucks in 2005. Individual road usage increased resulting in a relatively high traffic density to other nations. A further increase of traffic is expected in the future.\n\nHigh-speed vehicular traffic has a long tradition in Germany given that the first [[freeway]] ([[Autobahn]]) in the world, the [[AVUS]], and the world's first [[automobile]] were developed and built in Germany. Germany possesses one of the most dense road systems of the world. German motorways have no blanket [[speed limit]] for light vehicles. However, posted limits are in place on many dangerous or congested stretches as well as where traffic noise or pollution poses a problem.\n\nThe German government has had issues with upkeep of the country's autobahn network, having had to revamp the Eastern portion's transport system since the unification of Germany between the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) and the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (West Germany). With that, numerous construction projects have been put on hold in the west, and a vigorous reconstruction has been going on for almost 20 years. However, ever since the [[European Union]] formed, an overall streamlining and change of route plans have occurred as faster and more direct links to former [[Soviet bloc]] countries now exist and are in the works, with intense co-operation among European countries.\n\n[[Intercity bus service]] within Germany fell out of favour as [[Wirtschaftswunder|post-war prosperity increased]], and became almost extinct when legislation was introduced in the 1980s to protect the national railway. After that market was deregulated in 2012, some 150 new intercity bus lines have been established, leading to a significant shift from rail to bus for long journeys.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwyman/2015/10/20/european-bus-upstarts-snatch-20-of-passengers-from-rail/2/|title=European Bus Upstarts Snatch 20% of Passengers from Rail|first=Oliver Wyman on Transportation &|last=Logistics|publisher=}}</ref> The market has since consolidated with [[Flixbus]] controlling over 90% of it and also expanding into neighboring countries.\n\n=== Roads ===\n{{Main|Autobahn|Bundesstra\u00dfe|Landesstra\u00dfe|Kreisstra\u00dfe}}\n[[File:M\u00fcnchberger Senke.jpg|thumb|Three-lane [[autobahn]]]]\nGermany has approximately 650,000&nbsp;km of roads,<ref name=\"transtatsde\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iraptranstats.net/de |title=Transport in Germany |accessdate=2009-02-17 |work=International Transport Statistics Database |publisher=[[International Road Assessment Program|iRAP]] |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307013745/http://www.iraptranstats.net/de |archivedate=March 7, 2009 }}</ref> of which 231,000&nbsp;km are non-local roads.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=[[Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development|BMVBS]] | url=http://www.bmvbs.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/StB-LA/strasse.html | title=BMVBS - Verkehr und Mobilit\u00e4t-Stra\u00dfe | accessdate=2011-05-22 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011121646/http://www.bmvbs.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/StB-LA/strasse.html | archivedate=2011-10-11 | df= }}</ref> The road network is extensively used with nearly 2 trillion km travelled by car in 2005, in comparison to just 70 billion km travelled by rail and 35 billion km travelled by plane.<ref name=\"transtatsde\"/>\n\nThe '''[[Autobahn]]''' is the German federal highway system. The official German term is '''''{{Lang|de|Bundesautobahn}}''''' (plural ''{{Lang|de|Bundesautobahnen}}'', abbreviated ''BAB''), which translates as \"federal motorway\". Where no local speed limit is posted, the advisory limit ''([[Richtgeschwindigkeit]])'' is 130&nbsp;km/h. The ''Autobahn'' network had a total length of about {{convert|12996|km}} in 2016,<ref>https://www.statistik-bw.de/Statistik-Portal/de_jb16_jahrtab36.asp</ref> which ranks it among the most dense and longest systems in the world. Only federally built [[controlled-access highway]]s meeting certain construction standards including at least two lanes per direction are called ''\"Bundesautobahn\"''. They have their own, blue-coloured signs and their own numbering system. All ''Autobahnen'' are named by using the capital letter A, followed by a blank and a number (for example [[Bundesautobahn 8|A&nbsp;8]]).\n\nThe main ''Autobahnen'' going all across Germany have single digit numbers. Shorter highways of regional importance have double digit numbers (like [[Bundesautobahn 24|A&nbsp;24]], connecting Berlin and Hamburg). Very short stretches built for heavy local traffic (for example [[ring road]]s or the [[Bundesautobahn 555|A&nbsp;555]] from Cologne to Bonn) usually have three digits, where the first digit depends on the region.\n\nEast-west routes are usually even-numbered, north-south routes are usually odd-numbered. The numbers of the north-south ''Autobahnen'' increase from west to east; that is to say, the more easterly roads are given higher numbers. Similarly, the east-west routes use increasing numbers from north to south.\n\nThe autobahns are considered the safest category of German roads: for example, in 2012, while carrying 31% of all motorized road traffic, they only accounted for 11% of Germany's traffic fatalities.<ref name=\"http://www.bast.de 2012\">{{cite web\n|title=Traffic and Accident Data: Summary Statistics - Germany\n|date=December 2012\n|url=http://www.bast.de/EN/Publications/Media/Unfallkarten-national-englisch.pdf?__blob=publicationFile\n|work=Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Stra\u00dfenwesen (Federal Highway Research Institute)\n|publisher=Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Stra\u00dfenwesen\n|accessdate=2014-04-07|author=http://www.bast.de|format=PDF|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nGerman autobahns are still toll-free for light vehicles, but on 1 January 2005, a blanket [[LKW-Maut|mandatory toll on heavy trucks]] was introduced.\n\nThe national roads in Germany are called ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n'' (federal roads). Their numbers are usually well known to local road users, as they appear (written in black digits on a yellow rectangle with black border) on direction traffic signs and on street maps. A Bundesstra\u00dfe is often referred to as \"B\" followed by its number, for example [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 1|\"B1\"]], one of the main east-west routes. More important routes have lower numbers. Odd numbers are usually applied to north-south oriented roads, and even numbers for east-west routes. Bypass routes are referred to with an appended \"a\" (alternative) or \"n\" (new alignment), as in \"B&nbsp;56n\".\n\nOther main public roads are maintained by the ''[[States of Germany|Bundesl\u00e4nder]]'' (states), called ''[[Landesstra\u00dfe]]'' (country road) or ''Staatsstra\u00dfe'' (state road). The numbers of these roads are prefixed with \"L\", \"S\" or \"St\", but are usually not seen on direction signs or written on maps. They appear on the kilometre posts on the roadside. Numbers are unique only within one state.\n\nThe ''[[Landkreis]]e'' (districts) and municipalities are in charge of the minor roads and streets within villages, towns and cities. These roads have the number prefix \"K\" indicating a ''[[Kreisstra\u00dfe]]''.\n\n==Rail transport==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:DeutscheBahn gobeirne.jpg|thumb|[[InterCityExpress]] train at [[Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof]]]]\n{{main|Rail transport in Germany|History of rail transport in Germany}}\nGermany features a total of 43,468&nbsp;km railways, of which at least 19,973&nbsp;km are electrified (2014).<ref name=ciafactbook>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html |title=CIA World Facebook: Germany}}</ref>\n\n[[Deutsche Bahn AG|Deutsche Bahn]] (German Rail) is the major German railway infrastructure and service operator. Though Deutsche Bahn is a private company, the government still holds all shares and therefore Deutsche Bahn can still be called a state-owned company. Since its reformation under private law in 1994, Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG) no longer publishes details of the tracks it owns; in addition to the DBAG system there are about 280 privately or locally owned railway companies which own an approximate 3,000&nbsp;km to 4,000&nbsp;km of the total tracks and use DB tracks in ''open access''.\n\nRailway subsidies amounted to \u20ac17.0 billion in 2014<ref>{{cite web |title= German Railway Financing |url= https://www.deutschebahn.com/file/de/2192370/2RLvPOzueXgX19CucGFn4Wofp5E/2267530/data/finanz_eisenbahn_dtl.pdf |page= 2 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160310165357/https://www.deutschebahn.com/file/de/2192370/2RLvPOzueXgX19CucGFn4Wofp5E/2267530/data/finanz_eisenbahn_dtl.pdf |archivedate= 2016-03-10 |df=  }}</ref> and there are significant differences between the financing of long-distance and short-distance (or local) trains in Germany. While long-distance trains can be run by any railway company, the companies also receive no subsidies from the government. Local trains however are subsidised by the German states, which pay the operating companies to run these trains and indeed in 2013, 59% of the cost of short-distance passenger rail transport was covered by subsidies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BNetzA/Areas/Railways/Downloads/RailwayMarketAnalysis2014.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1 |title=Market Analysis: German Railways 2014 |access-date=2015-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127032909/http://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BNetzA/Areas/Railways/Downloads/RailwayMarketAnalysis2014.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1 |archive-date=2015-11-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> This resulted in many private companies offering to run local train services as they can provide cheaper service than the state-owned Deutsche Bahn. Track construction is entirely and track maintenance partly government financed both for long and short range trains.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} On the other hand, all rail vehicles are charged track access charges by [[DB Netz]] which in turn delivers (part of) its profits to the federal budget.\n\nHigh speed rail started in the early 1990s with the introduction of the Inter City Express  (ICE) into revenue service after first plans to modernize the rail system had been drawn up under the government of [[Willy Brandt]]. While the high speed network is not as dense as those of France or Spain, ICE or slightly slower (max. speed 200&nbsp;km/h) Intercity  (IC) serve most major cities. Several extensions or upgrades to high speed lines are under construction or planned for the near future, some of them after decades of planning.\n\nThe fastest high-speed train operated by Deutsche Bahn, the [[InterCityExpress]] or ICE connects major German and neighbouring international centres such as [[Zurich]], [[Vienna]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Paris]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[Brussels]]. The rail network throughout Germany is extensive and provides excellent service in most areas. On regular lines, at least one train every two hours will call even in the smallest of villages during the day. Nearly all larger metropolitan areas are served by [[S-Bahn]], [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]], [[Trams in Germany|Stra\u00dfenbahn]] and/or bus networks.\n\nThe German government on 13 February 2018 announced plans to make public transportation free as a means to reduce road traffic and decrease air pollution to EU-mandated levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/14/german-cities-to-trial-free-public-transport-to-cut-pollution|title=German cities to trial free public transport to cut pollution|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|date=2018-02-14|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-15}}</ref> The new policy will be put to the test by the end of the year in the cities of [[Bonn]], [[Essen]], [[Herrenberg]], [[Reutlingen]] and [[Mannheim]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/morgen-europa/politico-morgen-europa-freie-offis-gegen-schlechte-luft-neues-zum-spitzenkandidatenprozess-in-eigener-sache/|title=POLITICO Morgen Europa: Freie \u00d6ffis gegen schlechte Luft \u2014 Neues zum Spitzenkandidatenprozess \u2014 In eigener Sache|date=2018-02-13|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-02-15|language=en-US}}</ref> Issues remain concerning the costs of such a move as ticket sales for public transportation constitute a major source of income for cities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/kostenloser-nahverkehr-so-teuer-wie-eine-elbphilharmonie-pro-jahr-a-1193400.html|title=Kostenloser Nahverkehr: Allein in Hamburg so teuer wie eine Elbphilharmonie pro Jahr|date=2018-02-14|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2018-02-15}}</ref>\n\n=== International freight trains ===\nWhile Germany and most of [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]] Europe use {{RailGauge|1435mm|allk=on}}, differences in signalling, rules and regulations, electrification voltages, etc. create obstacles for freight operations across borders. These obstacles are slowly being overcome, with international (in- and outgoing) and transit (through) traffic being responsible for a large part of the recent uptake in rail freight volume. EU regulations have done much to harmonize standards, making cross border operations easier. [[Maschen Marshalling Yard]] near Hamburg is the second biggest in the world and the biggest in Europe. It serves as a freight hub distributing goods from Scandinavia to southern Europe and from Central Europe to the port of Hamburg and overseas.\n\n=== S-Bahn ===\nAlmost all major metro areas of Germany have suburban rail systems called [[S-Bahn]]en (''Schnellbahnen''). These usually connect larger agglomerations to their suburbs and often other regional towns, although the [[Rhein-Ruhr S-Bahn]] connects several large cities. A S-Bahn doesn't skip stations and runs more frequently than other trains. In [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]] the S-Bahn has a [[U-Bahn]]-like service and uses a [[third rail]] whereas all other S-Bahn services rely on regular catenary power supply.\n\n=== Rapid transit (U-Bahn) ===\n[[File:Munich subway C-Zug.jpg|thumb|Train on the [[Munich U-Bahn]]]]\nRelatively few cities have a full-fledged underground [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] system; [[S-Bahn]] (suburban [[commuter railway]]) systems are far more common. In some cities the distinction between U-Bahn and S-Bahn systems is blurred, for instance some S-Bahn systems run underground, have frequencies similar to U-Bahn, and form part of the same integrated transport network. A larger number of cities has upgraded their tramways to light rail standards. These systems are called [[Stadtbahn]] (not to be confused with S-Bahn), on main line rails.\n\nCities with [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] systems are:\n* [[Berlin]] ([[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]])\n* [[Hamburg]] ([[Hamburg U-Bahn|U-Bahn]])\n* [[Munich]] ([[Munich U-Bahn|U-Bahn]])\n* [[Nuremberg]]/[[F\u00fcrth]] ([[Nuremberg U-Bahn|U-Bahn]])\n[[File:Street car passengers as percent of total by German lander gradient map (2016) 2.gif|thumb|Street car passengers and tram systems by [[German L\u00e4nder]]]]\nWith the exception of Hamburg, all of those aforementioned cities also have a tram system, often with new lines built to light rail standards.\n\nCities with ''Stadtbahn'' systems can be found in the article [[Trams in Germany]].\n\n===Trams (Stra\u00dfenbahn)===\n{{See also|trams in Germany}}\nGermany was among the first countries to have electric street - running railways and Berlin has one of the longest tram networks in the world. Many West German cities abandoned their previous tram systems in the 1960s and 1970s while others upgraded them to \"[[Stadtbahn]]\" (~light rail) standard, often including underground sections. In the East, most cities retained or even expanded their tram systems and since reunification a trend towards new tram construction can be observed in most of the country. Today the only major German city without a tram or light rail system is Hamburg. [[Tram-train]] systems like the [[Karlsruhe model]] first came to prominence in Germany in the early 1990s and are implemented or discussed in several cities, providing coverage far into the rural areas surrounding cities.\n\n==Air transport==\nShort distances and the extensive network of motorways and railways make airplanes uncompetitive for travel within Germany. Only about 1% of all distance travelled was by plane in 2002.<ref name=\"transtatsde\"/> But due to a decline in prices with the introduction of low-fares airlines, domestic air travel is becoming more attractive. In 2013 Germany had the fifth largest passenger air market in the world with 105,016,346 passengers.<ref>World Bank Datebase, http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.PSGR</ref> However, the advent of new faster rail lines often leads to cuts in service by the airlines or even total abandonment of routes like Frankfurt-Cologne, Berlin-Hannover or Berlin-Hamburg.\n\n=== Airlines ===\n:''see: [[List of airlines of Germany]]''\n[[File:Lufthansa B737-300 D-ABEK @ D\u00fcsseldorf International Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Lufthansa]] and [[Air Berlin]] aircraft]]\nGermany's largest airline is [[Lufthansa]], which was privatised in the 1990s. Lufthansa also operates two regional subsidiaries under the [[Lufthansa Regional]] brand and a low-cost subsidiary, [[Eurowings]], which operates independently.  Lufthansa flies a dense network of domestic, European and intercontinental routes. Germany's second largest airline was [[Air Berlin]], which also operated a network of domestic and European destinations with a focus on leisure routes as well as some long-haul services. Air Berlin declared bankruptcy in 2017 with the last flight under its own name in October of that year.\n\nCharter and leisure carriers include [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[TUIfly]], [[SunExpress Deutschland]] and [[Germania (airline)|Germania]]. Major German cargo operators are [[Lufthansa Cargo]], [[European Air Transport Leipzig]] (which is a subsidiary of [[DHL]]) and [[AeroLogic]] (which is jointly owned by DHL and Lufthansa Cargo).\n\n===Airports===\n:''see: [[List of airports in Germany]]''\n[[File:Flugh\u00e4fen in Deutschland.png|thumb|Airports of Germany]]\n[[Frankfurt Airport]] is Germany's largest airport, a major transportation hub in Europe and the [[List of busiest airports by passenger traffic|world's  twelfth busiest airport]]. It is one of the airports with the largest number of international destinations served worldwide. Depending on whether total passengers, flights or cargo traffic are used as a measure, it ranks first, second or third in Europe alongside [[London Heathrow Airport]] and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport]]. Germany's second biggest international airport is [[Munich Airport]] followed by [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]].\n\nThere are several more scheduled passenger airports throughout Germany, mainly serving European metropolitan and leisure destinations. Intercontinental long-haul routes are operated to and from the airports in Frankfurt, Munich, D\u00fcsseldorf, Berlin-Tegel, Cologne/Bonn, Hamburg and Stuttgart.\n\n[[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] is expected to become the third largest German airport by annual passengers once it opens, serving as single airport for Berlin.

In practice, most German federal departments play some role in shaping foreign policy in the sense that there are few policy areas left that remain outside of international jurisdiction.  The bylaws of the Federal Cabinet (as delineated in Germany's Basic Law), however, assign the Federal Foreign Office a coordinating function.  Accordingly, other ministries may only invite foreign guests or participate in treaty negotiations with the approval of the Federal Foreign Office.\n\n===Bundestag===\nWith respect to foreign policy, the Bundestag acts in a supervisory capacity.  Each of its committees \u2013 most notably the foreign relations committee \u2013 oversees the country's foreign policy.  The consent of the Bundestag (and insofar as L\u00e4nder are impacted, the Bundesrat) is required to ratify foreign treaties. If a treaty legislation passes first reading, it is referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which is capable of delaying ratification and prejudice decision through its report to the Bundestag.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reunification and West German-Soviet Relations: The Role of the Reunification Issue in the Foreign Policy of the Federal Republic of Germany, 1949\u20131957, with Special Attention to Policy Toward the Soviet Union|last=Feld|first=Werner|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=2012|isbn=9789401194082|location=The Hague|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, a full EU Committee was also created for the purpose of addressing the large flow of EU-related topics and legislation.

These NGOs include think-tanks (German Council on Foreign Relations), single-issue lobbying organizations (Amnesty International), as well as other organizations that promote stronger bilateral ties between Germany and other countries (Atlantic Bridge).  While the budgets and methods of NGOs are distinct, the overarching goal to persuade decision-makers to the wisdom of their own views is a shared one. In 2004, a new German governance framework, particularly on foreign and security policy areas, emerged where NGOs are integrated into actual policymaking.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=NGOs in Foreign Policy: Security Governance in Germany and the Netherlands|last=Werner|first=Andreas|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|year=2016|isbn=9783830934073|location=Munster, Germany|pages=19-20}}</ref> The idea is that the cooperation between state and civil society groups increases the quality of [[conflict resolution]], [[Development aid|development cooperatio]]<nowiki/>n and [[humanitarian aid]] for [[Fragile States Index|fragile states]].

Bangladesh is a priority partner country of German Development Cooperation (GTZ). In trade with Germany, Bangladesh has for years recorded a large surplus.

The cultural cooperation between them is mainly channeled through the Goethe Institute that work on developing the cultural ties between both the countries by sponsoring local and German cultural activities. Both Germany and Bangladesh share common views on various international issues and work together in the UN and in other international forum.

The [[judiciary of Germany]] is independent of the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and the [[legislature]], while it is common for leading members of the executive to be member of the legislature, as well. The political system is laid out in the 1949 constitution, the ''[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Grundgesetz]]'' (Basic Law), which remained in effect with minor amendments after [[German reunification]] in 1990.\n\nThe constitution emphasizes the protection of [[individual liberty]] in an extensive catalogue of [[Human rights in Germany|human]] and [[civil rights]] and divides powers both between the federal and state levels and between the legislative, executive and judicial branches.\n\nWest Germany was a founding member of the [[European Communities|European Community]] in 1958, which became the [[European Union|EU]] in 1993. It is part of the [[Schengen Area]], and has been a member of the [[eurozone]] since 1999. It is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[G8]], the [[G-20 major economies|G20]] and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].\n\nThe [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] has rated Germany as a \"[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|full democracy]]\" in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://infographics.economist.com/2018/DemocracyIndex/|title=The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index|last=solutions|first=Economist Intelligence Unit|date=|website=www.economist.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Prior to 1998===\nAfter 1949, the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] had [[CDU/CSU|Christian Democratic]] chancellors for 20 years until a coalition between the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Liberals]] took over. From 1982, Christian Democratic leader [[Helmut Kohl]] was chancellor in a coalition with the Liberals for 16 years. In this period fell the reunification of Germany, in 1990: the [[German Democratic Republic]] joined the Federal Republic. In the former GDR's territory, five ''L\u00e4nder'' (states) were established or reestablished. The two parts of Berlin united as one \"Land\" (state).\n\nThe political system of the Federal Republic remained more or less unchanged. Specific provisions for the former GDR territory were enabled via the ''unification treaty'' between the Federal Republic and the GDR prior to the [[German Unity Day|unification day]] of 3 October 1990. However, Germany saw in the following two distinct party systems: the Green party and the Liberals remained mostly West German parties, while in the East the former socialist state party, now called PDS, flourished along with the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats.\n\n===1998\u20132005===\n[[File:Schroeder2002.jpg|thumb|[[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] in the 2002 elections]]\n[[File:Joschka Fischer 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Joschka Fischer]] in the 2005 elections]]\n\nAfter 16 years of the Christian\u2013Liberal coalition, led by [[Helmut Kohl]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) together with the Greens won the Bundestag elections of 1998. SPD vice chairman [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] positioned himself as a centrist candidate, in contradiction to the leftist SPD chairman [[Oskar Lafontaine]]. The Kohl government was hurt at the polls by slower economic growth in the East in the previous two years, and constantly high unemployment. The final margin of victory was sufficiently high to permit a \"red-green\" coalition of the SPD with [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] (''B\u00fcndnis '90/Die Gr\u00fcnen''), bringing the Greens into a national government for the first time.\n\nInitial problems of the new government, marked by policy disputes between the moderate and traditional left wings of the SPD, resulted in some voter disaffection. Lafontaine left the government (and later his party) in early 1999. The CDU won in some important state elections but was hit in 2000 by a party donation scandal from the Kohl years. As a result of this [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) crisis, [[Angela Merkel]] became chair.\n\nThe [[German federal election, 2002|next election for the ''Bundestag'']] was on 22 September 2002. Gerhard Schr\u00f6der led the coalition of SPD and Greens to an eleven-seat victory over the Christian Democrat challengers headed by [[Edmund Stoiber]] (CSU). Three factors are generally cited that enabled Schr\u00f6der to win the elections despite poor approval ratings a few months before and a weaker economy: good handling of the [[2002 European floods|100-year flood]], firm opposition to the US [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and Stoiber's unpopularity in the east, which cost the CDU crucial seats there.\n\nIn its second term, the red\u2013green coalition lost several very important state elections, for example in [[Lower Saxony]] where Schr\u00f6der was the prime minister from 1990 to 1998. On 20 April 2003, chancellor Schr\u00f6der announced massive labor market reforms, called [[Agenda 2010]], that cut unemployment benefits. Although these reforms sparked massive protests, they are now credited with being in part responsible for the relatively strong economic performance of Germany during the [[European debt crisis|euro-crisis]] and the decrease in unemployment in Germany in the years 2006-2007.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.bpb.de/nachschlagen/zahlen-und-fakten/soziale-situation-in-deutschland/61718/arbeitslose-und-arbeitslosenquote|title=Arbeitslose und Arbeitslosenquote}}</ref>\n\n===2005\u20132009===\n{{Main|German federal election, 2005}}\n[[File:Angela Merkel (2008).jpg|thumb|Chancellor since 2005: [[Angela Merkel]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democrats]]]]\n\nOn 22 May 2005 the SPD received a devastating defeat in its former heartland, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Half an hour after the election results, the SPD chairman [[Franz M\u00fcntefering]] announced that the chancellor would clear the way for new federal elections.\n\nThis took the republic by surprise, especially because the SPD was below 25% in polls at the time. The CDU quickly announced [[Angela Merkel]] as Christian Democrat candidate for chancellor, aspiring to be the first female chancellor in German history.\n\nNew for the 2005 election was the alliance between the newly formed [[Electoral Alternative for Labor and Social Justice]] (WASG) and the PDS, planning to fuse into a common party (see [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party.PDS]]). With the former SPD chairman, Oskar Lafontaine for the WASG and [[Gregor Gysi]] for the PDS as prominent figures, this alliance soon found interest in the media and in the population. Polls in July saw them as high as 12%.\n\nWhereas in May and June 2005 victory of the Christian Democrats seemed highly likely, with some polls giving them an absolute majority, this picture changed shortly before the election on 18 September 2005.\n\n[[File:Frank-Walter Steinmeier 04.jpg|thumb|[[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] was the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] candidate for chancellor in 2009 and President of Germany since 2017]]\n\nThe election results of 18 September were surprising because they differed widely from the polls of the previous weeks. The Christian Democrats even lost votes compared to 2002, narrowly reaching the first place with only 35.2%, and failed to get a majority for a \"black\u2013yellow\" government of [[CDU/CSU]] and liberal FDP. But the red\u2013green coalition also failed to get a majority, with the SPD losing votes, but polling 34.2% and the greens staying at 8.1%. [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] reached 8.7% and entered the ''[[Bundestag]]'', whereas the far-right [[National Democratic Party of Germany|NPD]] only got 1.6%.<ref>[http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/bundestagswahlen/BTW_BUND_05/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/b_tabelle_99.html Official election results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423055851/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/bundestagswahlen/BTW_BUND_05/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/b_tabelle_99.html |date=23 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe most likely outcome of coalition talks was a so-called grand coalition between the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD). Three party coalitions and coalitions involving The Left had been ruled out by all interested parties (including The Left itself). On 22 November 2005, Angela Merkel was sworn in by president [[Horst K\u00f6hler]] for the office of Bundeskanzlerin.\n\nThe existence of the grand coalition on federal level helped smaller parties' electoral prospects in state elections. Since in 2008, the CSU lost its absolute majority in Bavaria and formed a coalition with the FDP, the grand coalition had no majority in the ''Bundesrat'' and depended on FDP votes on important issues. In November 2008, the SPD re-elected its already retired chair [[Franz M\u00fcntefering]] and made [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] its leading candidate for the federal election in September 2009.\n\nAs a result of [[German federal election, 2009|that federal election]], the grand coalition brought losses for both parties and came to an end. The SPD suffered the heaviest losses in its history and was unable to form a coalition government. The CDU/CSU had only little losses but also reached a new historic low with its worst result since 1949. The three smaller parties thus had more seats in the German ''Bundestag'' than ever before, with the liberal party FDP winning 14.6% of votes.\n\n=== 2009\u20132013 ===\n{{Main|German federal election, 2009}}\n[[File:Sitze Bundestagswahl 2009.svg|thumb|Seats in the Bundestag 2009]]\n[[File:Sigmar Gabriel-2009 ArM.jpg|thumb|[[Sigmar Gabriel]]: [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] chairman from 2009\u20132017, 2013\u20132017 [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Deputy to the Chancellor]]]]\n\nThe CDU/CSU and FDP together held 332 seats (of 622 total seats) and had been in coalition since 27 October 2009. Angela Merkel was re-elected as chancellor, and [[Guido Westerwelle]] served as the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|foreign minister]] and vice chancellor of Germany. After being elected into the federal government, the FDP suffered heavy losses in the following state elections. The FDP had promised to lower taxes in the electoral campaign, but after being part of the coalition they had to concede that this was not possible due to the [[Great Recession|economic crisis]] of 2008. Because of the losses, Guido Westerwelle had to resign as chair of the FDP in favor of [[Philipp R\u00f6sler]], [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal minister of health]], who was consequently appointed as [[Vice Chancellor of Germany|vice chancellor]]. Shortly after, Philipp R\u00f6sler changed office and became [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany)|federal minister of economics and technology]].\n\nAfter their electoral defeat, the Social Democrats were led by [[Sigmar Gabriel]], a former federal minister and prime minister of Lower Saxony, and by [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] as the head of the parliamentary group. He resigned on 16 January 2017 and proposed his longtime friend and president of [[European Parliament]] [[Martin Schulz]] as his successor and chancellor candidate.<ref>https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/01/26/germ-j26.html</ref>\nGermany has seen increased political activity by citizens outside the established political parties with respect to local and [[environmental activism|environmental]] issues such as the location of [[Stuttgart 21]], a railway hub, and construction of [[Berlin-Brandenburg International Airport]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Dempsey|first=Judy|title=German Politics Faces Grass-Roots Threat|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/world/europe/02germany.html|accessdate=16 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== 2013\u20132017 ===\n{{main article|German federal election, 2013}}\n[[File:SeatsGermanBundestag2013.JPG|thumb|The allocation of seats in the German Bundestag after 2013 elections]]\nThe 18th federal elections in Germany resulted in the re-election of [[Angela Merkel]] and her Christian democratic parliamentary group of the parties [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] and CSU, receiving 41.5% of all votes.

The two big parties, the conservative parliamentary group  [[CDU/CSU]] and the social democrat [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] were in a similar situation as in 2009, after the last grand coalition had ended, and both had suffered severe losses; reaching their second worst and worst result respectively in 2017.  \n\nMany votes in the 2017 elections went to smaller parties, leading the right-wing populist party [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]] (Alternative for Germany) into the [[Bundestag]] which marked a big shift in German politics since it was the first far-right party to win seats in parliament since the 1950s. \n\nWith Merkel's candidacy for a fourth term, the CDU/CSU only reached 33.0% of the votes, but won the highest number of seats, leaving no realistic coalition option without the CDU/CSU. As all parties in the Bundestag strictly ruled out a coalition with the AfD, the only options for a majority coalition were a so-called [[Germany coalition (politics)|\"Jamaican\" coalition]] (CDU/CSU, [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]]; named after the party colors and those of the Jamaican flag) and a grand coalition with the SPD, which was at first opposed by the Social Democrats and their leader [[Martin Schulz]]. \n\nCoalition talks between the three \"Jamaican\" parties were held but the final proposal was rejected by the liberals of the FDP, leaving the government in limbo.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/nov/20/markets-rattled-euro-dax-bunds-german-coalition-talks-collapse-business-live|title=Markets rattled as German coalition talks collapse \u2013 business live|last=Wearden|first=Graeme|date=2017-11-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://amp.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/sep/24/german-elections-2017-angela-merkel-cdu-spd-afd-live-updates|title=German elections 2017: Angela Merkel wins fourth term but AfD makes gains \u2013 as it happened|last=Henley|first=Jon|date=2017-09-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref> Following the unprecedented situation, for the first time in German history different minority coalitions or even direct snap coalitions were also heavily discussed.

Their office involves an integrative role.<ref>Website of the Federal President of Germany [http://www.bundespraesident.de/EN/Role-and-Functions/ConstitutionalBasis/ConstitutionalBasis-node.html;jsessionid=199EA05B058DB4F409D855E3A833D30C.2_cid379] Retrieved 13 April 2014</ref> Nearly all actions of the Federal President become valid only after a [[countersignature]] of a government member.\n\nThe President is not obliged by Constitution to refrain from political views.

Most German Presidents were active politicians and party members prior to the office, which means that they have to change their political style when becoming President. The function comprises the official residence of [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]].\n\nUnder Article 59 (1) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], the Federal President represents the Federal Republic of Germany in matters of international law, concludes treaties with foreign states on its behalf and accredits diplomats.<ref>Website of the Federal President of Germany [http://www.bundespraesident.de/EN/Role-and-Functions/RoleInTheInternationalArena/roleintheinternationalarena-node.html] Retrieved 28 April 2014.</ref>\n\nAll federal laws must be signed by the President before they can come into effect; he or she does not have a veto, but the conditions for refusing to sign a law on the basis of unconstitutionality are the subject of debate.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Grundrechtsbindung des Gesetzgebers: eine rechtsvergleichende Studie zu Deutschland, Frankreich und den USA|language=German|pages=123ff|first= Friederike Valerie|last= Lange|date=2010|isbn= 978-316-150420-4|publisher= Mohr Siebeck}}</ref> The office is currently held by [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] (since 2017). <!--update \"current\"-->\n\nThe Federal President does have a role in the political system, especially at the establishment of a new government and the dissolution of the Bundestag (parliament). This role is usually nominal but can become significant in case of political instability. Additionally, a Federal President together with the Federal Council can support the government in a \"legislatory emergency state\" to enable laws against the will of the Bundestag (Article 81 of the Basic Law). However, until now the Federal President has never had to use these \"[[reserve power]]s.\"\n\n===Head of government===\n{{Main|Chancellor of Germany (1949\u2013)}}\n[[File:150515 Bundeskanzleramt (Berlin) Ostseite.jpg|thumb|[[German Chancellery]]]]\n\nThe ''[[Chancellor of Germany (1949\u2013)|Bundeskanzler]]'' (federal chancellor) heads the ''[[Cabinet of Germany|Bundesregierung]]'' (federal government) and thus the [[executive branch]] of the federal government. He or she is elected by and responsible to the ''[[Bundestag]]'', Germany's parliament. The other members of the government are the Federal Ministers; they are chosen by the Chancellor. Germany, like the United Kingdom, can thus be classified as a [[parliamentary system]]. The office is currently held by [[Angela Merkel]] (since 2005). <!--update \"current\"-->\n\nThe Chancellor cannot be removed from office during a four-year term unless the ''Bundestag'' has agreed on a successor. This [[constructive vote of no confidence]] is intended to avoid a similar situation to that of the [[Weimar Republic]] in which the executive did not have enough support in the legislature to govern effectively, but the legislature was too divided to name a successor. The current system also prevents the Chancellor from calling a [[snap election]].\n\nExcept in the periods 1969\u20131972 and 1976\u20131982, when the Social Democratic party of Chancellor Brandt and Schmidt came in second in the elections, the chancellor has always been the candidate of the largest party, usually supported by a coalition of two parties with a majority in the parliament. The chancellor appoints one of the federal ministers as their deputy,<ref>Article 69 of the Basic Law</ref> who has the unofficial title [[Vice Chancellor of Germany|Vice Chancellor]] ({{lang-de|Vizekanzler}}). The office is currently held by [[Olaf Scholz]] (since March 2018). <!--update \"current\"-->\n\n===Cabinet===\n{{main|Cabinet of Germany}}\n\nThe German Cabinet (Bundeskabinett or Bundesregierung) is the chief [[executive branch|executive]] body of the Federal Republic of Germany. It consists of the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|chancellor]] and the [[cabinet minister]]s. The fundamentals of the cabinet's organization are set down in articles 62\u201369 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]]. The current cabinet is Merkel IV (since 2018). \n\n<!--update \"current\"-->  \n==Legislature==\n{{main|Bundestag|Bundesrat of Germany}}\n\nFederal legislative power is divided between the ''Bundestag'' and the ''Bundesrat''. The ''Bundestag'' is directly elected by the German people, while the ''Bundesrat'' represents the governments of the regional states (''L\u00e4nder''). The federal legislature has powers of [[exclusive jurisdiction]] and [[concurrent jurisdiction]] with the states in areas specified in the constitution.\n\nThe ''Bundestag'' is more powerful than the ''Bundesrat'' and only needs the latter's consent for proposed legislation related to revenue shared by the federal and state governments, and the imposition of responsibilities on the states. In practice, however, the agreement of the ''Bundesrat'' in the legislative process is often required, since federal legislation frequently has to be executed by state or local agencies. In the event of disagreement between the ''Bundestag'' and the ''Bundesrat'', a conciliation committee is formed to find a compromise.\n\n===Bundestag===\n[[File:Reichstag0170.JPG|thumb|[[Reichstag building]]]]\n\nThe ''Bundestag'' (Federal Diet) is elected for a four-year term and consists of 598 or more members elected by a means of [[mixed-member proportional representation]], which Germans call \"personalised proportional representation.\" 299 members represent single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] and are elected by a [[first past the post electoral system]]. Parties that obtain fewer constituency seats than their national share of the vote are allotted seats from party lists to make up the difference. In contrast, parties that obtain more constituency seats than their national share of the vote are allowed to keep these so-called [[overhang seat]]s. In the parliament that was elected in 2009, there were 24 overhang seats, giving the ''Bundestag'' a total of 622 members. After Bundestag elections since 2013, other parties obtain extra seats (\"balance seats\") that offset advantages from their rival's overhang seats. The current ''Bundestag'' is the largest in German history with 709 parliament members.\n\nA party must receive either five percent of the national vote or win at least three directly elected seats to be eligible for non-constituency seats in the ''Bundestag''. This rule, often called the \"five percent hurdle\", was incorporated into Germany's election law to prevent political fragmentation and strong minor parties. The first ''Bundestag'' elections were held in the Federal Republic of Germany (\"West Germany\") on 14 August 1949. Following reunification, [[German federal election, 1990|elections for the first all-German ''Bundestag'']] were held on 2 December 1990. The last [[German federal election, 2017|federal election]] was held on 24 September 2017.\n\n==Judiciary==\n{{main|Judiciary of Germany}}\n[[File:Karlsruhe bundesverfassungsgericht.jpg|thumb|Constitutional court in [[Karlsruhe]]]]\nGermany follows the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law tradition]]. The judicial system comprises three types of courts.\n\n* Ordinary courts, dealing with [[criminal law|criminal]] and most [[Private law|civil]] cases, are the most numerous by far. The [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] (''Bundesgerichtshof'') is the highest ordinary court and also the highest court of appeals.\n* Specialized courts hear cases related to [[Administrative law|administrative]], [[Labour law|labour]], social, fiscal and [[patent law]].\n* Constitutional courts focus on judicial review and constitutional interpretation. The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] (''Bundesverfassungsgericht'') is the highest court dealing with constitutional matters.\n*\n\nThe main difference between the Federal Constitutional Court and the Federal Court of Justice is that the Federal Constitutional Court may only be called if a constitutional matter within a case is in question (e.g. a possible violation of human rights in a criminal trial), while the Federal Court of Justice may be called in any case.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Germany}}\n[[Image:European union emu map en.png|thumb|Germany is a member of the European Union and the [[Eurozone]]]]\nGermany maintains a network of 229 diplomatic missions abroad and holds relations with more than 190 countries.<ref>[http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/AAmt/Auslandsvertretungen/Uebersicht_node.html German Missions Abroad] German Federal Foreign Office.

Geometry was one of the two fields of pre-modern [[mathematics]], the other being the study of numbers ([[arithmetic]]).\n\nClassic geometry was focused in [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge constructions]]. Geometry was revolutionized by [[Euclid]], who introduced [[mathematical rigor]] and the [[axiomatic method]] still in use today. His book, ''[[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]]'' is widely considered the most influential textbook of all time, and was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century.<ref>Howard Eves, ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'', Saunders: 1990 ({{ISBN|0-03-029558-0}}), p.&nbsp;141: \"No work, except [[The Bible]], has been more widely used....\"</ref>\n\nIn modern times, geometric concepts have been generalized to a high level of abstraction and complexity, and have been subjected to the methods of calculus and abstract algebra, so that many modern branches of the field are barely recognizable as the descendants of early geometry. (See [[Areas of mathematics]] and [[Algebraic geometry]].)\n\n==Early geometry==\nThe earliest recorded beginnings of geometry can be traced to early peoples, who discovered obtuse triangles in the [[Indus Valley Civilization|ancient Indus Valley]] (see [[Indian mathematics#Harappan Mathematics(3300 BC - 1500 BC)|Harappan Mathematics]]), and ancient [[Babylonia]] (see [[Babylonian mathematics]]) from around 3000 BC. Early geometry was a collection of empirically discovered principles concerning lengths, angles, areas, and volumes, which were developed to meet some practical need in [[surveying]], [[construction]], [[astronomy]], and various crafts. Among these were some surprisingly sophisticated principles, and a modern mathematician might be hard put to derive some of them without the use of [[calculus]]. For example, both the [[Egyptians]] and the [[Babylon]]ians were aware of versions of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] about 1500 years before [[Pythagoras]] and the Indian [[Sulba Sutras]] around 800 B.C. contained the first statements of the theorem; the Egyptians had a correct formula for the volume of a [[frustum]] of a square pyramid;\n\n===Egyptian geometry===\n{{main|Egyptian geometry}}\n\nThe ancient Egyptians knew that they could approximate the area of a circle as follows:<ref name=\"School Mathematics\">Ray C.

This assumes that [[pi|{{pi}}]] is 4&times;(8/9)\u00b2 (or 3.160493...), with an error of slightly over 0.63 percent. This value was slightly less accurate than the calculations of the [[Babylonia]]ns (25/8 = 3.125, within 0.53 percent), but was not otherwise surpassed until [[Archimedes]]' approximation of 211875/67441 = 3.14163, which had an error of just over 1 in 10,000.\n\nAhmes knew of the modern 22/7 as an approximation for {{pi}}, and used it to split a hekat, hekat x 22/x x 7/22 = hekat;{{cn|date=July 2018}} however, Ahmes continued to use the traditional 256/81 value for {{pi}} for computing his hekat volume found in a cylinder.\n\nProblem 48 involved using a square with side 9 units. This square was cut into a 3x3 grid. The diagonal of the corner squares were used to make an irregular octagon with an area of 63 units. This gave a second value for {{pi}} of 3.111...\n\nThe two problems together indicate a range of values for {{pi}} between 3.11 and 3.16.\n\nProblem 14 in the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] gives the only ancient example finding the volume of a [[frustum]] of a pyramid, describing the correct formula:\n:<math>V = \\frac{1}{3} h(x_1^2 + x_1 x_2 +x_2^2).</math>\n\n===Babylonian geometry===\n{{main|Babylonian mathematics}}\n\nThe Babylonians may have known the general rules for measuring areas and volumes. They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if ''[[\u03c0]]'' is estimated as 3. The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the base and the height, however, the volume of the frustum of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases. The [[Pythagorean theorem]] was also known to the Babylonians. Also, there was a recent discovery in which a tablet used ''\u03c0'' as 3 and 1/8. The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile, which was a measure of distance equal to about seven miles today. This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time.<ref>Eves, Chapter 2.</ref> There have been recent discoveries showing that ancient Babylonians may have discovered astronomical geometry nearly 1400 years before Europeans did.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/01/28/clay-tablets-reveal-babylonians-invented-astronomical-geometry-1400-years-before-europeans/</ref>\n\n===Vedic India===\n\n[[Image:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Rigveda]]'' manuscript in [[Devanagari]].]]\nThe Indian [[Vedic period]] had a tradition of geometry, mostly expressed in the construction of elaborate altars.\nEarly Indian texts (1st millennium BC) on this topic include the   ''[[Satapatha Brahmana]]'' and  the ''[[Shulba Sutras|\u015aulba S\u016btras]]''.<ref>A.

It is not certain what practical use these arithmetic rules had. The best conjecture is that they were part of religious ritual. A Hindu home was required to have three fires burning at three different altars. The three altars were to be of different shapes, but all three were to have the same area. These conditions led to certain \"Diophantine\" problems, a particular case of which is the generation of Pythagorean triples, so as to make one square integer equal to the sum of two others.\"</ref>\nThey also contain statements (that with hindsight we know to be approximate) about [[squaring the circle]] and \"circling the square.\"<ref name=cooke199-200>{{Harv|Cooke|2005|pp=199\u2013200}}: \"The requirement of three altars of equal areas but different shapes would explain the interest in transformation of areas.

The occurrence of the triples in the ''Sulvasutras'' is comparable to mathematics that one may encounter in an introductory book on architecture or another similar applied area, and\nwould not correspond directly to the overall knowledge on the topic at that time. Since, unfortunately, no other contemporaneous sources have been found it may never be possible to settle this issue satisfactorily.\"<ref name=dani/></blockquote>\n\nIn all, three ''Sulba Sutras'' were composed. The remaining two, the ''Manava Sulba Sutra'' composed by [[Manava]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 750-650 BC) and the ''Apastamba Sulba Sutra'', composed by [[Apastamba]] (c. 600 BC), contained results similar to the ''Baudhayana Sulba Sutra''.\n\n==Greek geometry==\n{{see also|Greek mathematics}}\n\n===Classical Greek geometry===\nFor the ancient [[Greece|Greek]] [[Greek mathematics|mathematicians]], geometry was the crown jewel of their sciences, reaching a completeness and perfection of methodology that no other branch of their knowledge had attained. They expanded the range of geometry to many new kinds of figures, curves, surfaces, and solids; they changed its methodology from trial-and-error to logical deduction; they recognized that geometry studies [[Substantial form|\"eternal forms\"]], or abstractions, of which physical objects are only approximations; and they developed the idea of the [[axiomatic system|\"axiomatic method\"]], still in use today.\n\n====Thales and Pythagoras====\n[[Image:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|[[Pythagorean theorem]]: ''a''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''c''<sup>2</sup>]]\n[[Thales]] (635-543 BC) of [[Miletus]] (now in southwestern Turkey), was the first to whom deduction in mathematics is attributed. There are five geometric propositions for which he wrote deductive proofs, though his proofs have not survived. [[Pythagoras]] (582-496 BC) of Ionia, and later, Italy, then colonized by Greeks, may have been a student of Thales, and traveled to [[Babylon]] and [[Egypt]]. The theorem that bears his name may not have been his discovery, but he was probably one of the first to give a deductive proof of it. He gathered a group of students around him to study mathematics, music, and philosophy, and together they discovered most of what high school students learn today in their geometry courses. In addition, they made the profound discovery of [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable lengths]] and [[irrational number]]s.\n\n====Plato====\n[[Plato]] (427-347 BC) is a philosopher that is highly esteemed by the Greeks. There is a story that he had inscribed above the entrance to his famous school, \"Let none ignorant of geometry enter here.\" However, the story is considered to be untrue.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cherowitzo|first1=Bill|title=What precisely was written over the door of Plato's Academy?|url=http://www.math.ucdenver.edu/~jloats/APresentations_2010/PlatosAcademy_Jim's10.ppt.pdf|website=www.math.ucdenver.edu/|accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref> Though he was not a mathematician himself, his views on mathematics had great influence. Mathematicians thus accepted his belief that geometry should use no tools but compass and straightedge \u2013 never measuring instruments such as a marked [[ruler]] or a [[protractor]], because these were a workman\u2019s tools, not worthy of a scholar. This dictum led to a deep study of possible [[compass and straightedge]] constructions, and three classic construction problems: how to use these tools to [[trisect an angle]], to construct a cube twice the volume of a given cube, and to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. The proofs of the impossibility of these constructions, finally achieved in the 19th century, led to important principles regarding the deep structure of the real number system. [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BC), Plato\u2019s greatest pupil, wrote a treatise on methods of reasoning used in deductive proofs (see [[Logic]]) which was not substantially improved upon until the 19th century.\n\n===Hellenistic geometry===\n\n====Euclid====\n[[Image:EuclidStatueOxford.jpg|thumb|Statue of Euclid in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]].]]\n\n[[Image:Woman teaching geometry.jpg|thumb|''Woman teaching geometry''. Illustration at the beginning of a medieval translation of Euclid's [[Element (mathematics)|Elements]], (c. 1310)]]\n<!--[[Image:Title page of Sir Henry Billingsley's first English version of Euclid's Elements, 1570 (560x900).jpg|right|200px|thumb|The [[frontispiece]] of Sir Henry Billingsley's first English version of Euclid's ''Elements'', 1570]]-->\n[[Euclid]] (c. 325-265 BC), of [[Alexandria]], probably a student at the Academy founded by Plato, wrote a treatise in 13 books (chapters), titled ''[[Euclid's Elements|The Elements of Geometry]]'', in which he presented geometry in an ideal [[axiom]]atic form, which came to be known as [[Euclidean geometry]]. The treatise is not a compendium of all that the [[Hellenistic]] mathematicians knew at the time about geometry; Euclid himself wrote eight more advanced books on geometry. We know from other references that Euclid\u2019s was not the first elementary geometry textbook, but it was so much superior that the others fell into disuse and were lost. He was brought to the university at Alexandria by [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy I]], King of Egypt.\n\n''The Elements'' began with definitions of terms, fundamental geometric principles (called ''axioms'' or ''postulates''), and general quantitative principles (called ''common notions'') from which all the rest of geometry could be logically deduced. Following are his five axioms, somewhat paraphrased to make the English easier to read.\n\n# Any two points can be joined by a straight line.\n# Any finite straight line can be extended in a straight line.\n# A circle can be drawn with any center and any radius.\n# All right angles are equal to each other.\n# If two straight lines in a plane are crossed by another straight line (called the transversal), and the interior angles between the two lines and the transversal lying on one side of the transversal add up to less than two right angles, then on that side of the transversal, the two lines extended will intersect (also called the [[parallel postulate]]).\n\nConcepts, that are now understood as [[algebra]], were expressed geometrically by Euclid, a method referred to as [[Greek geometric algebra]].\n\n====Archimedes====\n\n[[Archimedes]] (287-212 BC), of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], [[Sicily]], when it was a [[Greek city-state]], is often considered to be the greatest of the Greek mathematicians, and occasionally even named as one of the three greatest of all time (along with [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]). Had he not been a mathematician, he would still be remembered as a great physicist, engineer, and inventor. In his mathematics, he developed methods very similar to the coordinate systems of analytic geometry, and the limiting process of integral calculus. The only element lacking for the creation of these fields was an efficient algebraic notation in which to express his concepts{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.\n\n====After Archimedes====\n[[Image:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Geometry was connected to the divine for most [[History of science in the Middle Ages|medieval scholars]]. The [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] in this 13th-century manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation myth|Creation]].]]\nAfter Archimedes, Hellenistic mathematics began to decline. There were a few minor stars yet to come, but the golden age of geometry was over. [[Proclus]] (410-485), author of ''Commentary on the First Book of Euclid'', was one of the last important players in Hellenistic geometry. He was a competent geometer, but more importantly, he was a superb commentator on the works that preceded him. Much of that work did not survive to modern times, and is known to us only through his commentary. The Roman Republic and Empire that succeeded and absorbed the Greek city-states produced excellent engineers, but no mathematicians of note.\n\nThe great [[Library of Alexandria]] was later burned. There is a growing consensus among historians that the Library of Alexandria likely suffered from several destructive events, but that the destruction of Alexandria's pagan temples in the late 4th century was probably the most severe and final one. The evidence for that destruction is the most definitive and secure. Caesar's invasion may well have led to the loss of some 40,000-70,000 scrolls in a warehouse adjacent to the port (as [[Luciano Canfora]] argues, they were likely copies produced by the Library intended for export), but it is unlikely to have affected the Library or Museum, given that there is ample evidence that both existed later.<ref>[[Luciano Canfora]]; ''The Vanished Library''; University of California Press, 1990. - [https://books.google.com/books?id=q6NsoT1akU4C books.google.com.br]</ref>\n\nCivil wars, decreasing investments in maintenance and acquisition of new scrolls and generally declining interest in non-religious pursuits likely contributed to a reduction in the body of material available in the Library, especially in the 4th century. The Serapeum was certainly destroyed by Theophilus in 391, and the Museum and Library may have fallen victim to the same campaign.\n\n==Classical Indian geometry==\n{{see also|Indian mathematics}}\n\nIn the [[Bakhshali manuscript]], there is a handful of geometric problems (including problems about volumes of irregular solids).

It was compiled years after his death by his followers around the year 330 BC.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 91\"/> Although the ''Mo Jing'' is the oldest existent book on geometry in China, there is the possibility that even older written material existed. However, due to the infamous [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|Burning of the Books]] in a political maneuver by the [[Qin Dynasty]] ruler [[Qin Shihuang]] (r. 221-210 BC), multitudes of written literature created before his time were purged. In addition, the ''Mo Jing'' presents geometrical concepts in mathematics that are perhaps too advanced not to have had a previous geometrical base or mathematic background to work upon.\n\nThe ''Mo Jing'' described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science, and provided a small wealth of information on mathematics as well. It provided an 'atomic' definition of the geometric point, stating that a line is separated into parts, and the part which has no remaining parts (i.e. cannot be divided into smaller parts) and thus forms the extreme end of a line is a point.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 91\">Needham, Volume 3, 91.</ref> Much like [[Euclid]]'s first and third definitions and [[Plato]]'s 'beginning of a line', the ''Mo Jing'' stated that \"a point may stand at the end (of a line) or at its beginning like a head-presentation in childbirth. (As to its invisibility) there is nothing similar to it.\"<ref name=\"needham volume 3 92\">Needham, Volume 3, 92.</ref> Similar to the [[atomist]]s of [[Democritus]], the ''Mo Jing'' stated that a point is the smallest unit, and cannot be cut in half, since 'nothing' cannot be halved.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 92\"/> It stated that two lines of equal length will always finish at the same place,<ref name=\"needham volume 3 92\"/> while providing definitions for the ''comparison of lengths'' and for ''parallels'',<ref name=\"needham volume 3 92 93\">Needham, Volume 3, 92-93.</ref> along with principles of space and bounded space.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 93\">Needham, Volume 3, 93.</ref> It also described the fact that planes without the quality of thickness cannot be piled up since they cannot mutually touch.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 93 94\">Needham, Volume 3, 93-94.</ref> The book provided definitions for circumference, diameter, and radius, along with the definition of volume.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 94\">Needham, Volume 3, 94.</ref>\n\nThe [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC-220 AD) period of China witnessed a new flourishing of mathematics. One of the oldest Chinese mathematical texts to present [[geometric progression]]s was the ''[[Su\u00e0n sh\u00f9 sh\u016b]]'' of 186 BC, during the Western Han era. The mathematician, inventor, and astronomer [[Zhang Heng]] (78-139 AD) used geometrical formulas to solve mathematical problems. Although rough estimates for [[pi]] ([[\u03c0]]) were given in the ''[[Zhou Li]]'' (compiled in the 2nd century BC),<ref name=\"needham volume 3 99\">Needham, Volume 3, 99.</ref> it was Zhang Heng who was the first to make a concerted effort at creating a more accurate formula for pi. Zhang Heng approximated pi as 730/232 (or approx 3.1466), although he used another formula of pi in finding a spherical volume, using the square root of 10 (or approx 3.162) instead. [[Zu Chongzhi]] (429-500 AD) improved the accuracy of the approximation of pi to between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, with [[Mil\u00fc|<sup>355</sup>\u2044<sub>113</sub>]] (\u5bc6\u7387, Mil\u00fc, detailed approximation) and [[Proof that 22/7 exceeds \u03c0|<sup>22</sup>\u2044<sub>7</sub>]] (\u7ea6\u7387, Yuel\u00fc, rough approximation) being the other notable approximation.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 101\">Needham, Volume 3, 101.</ref> In comparison to later works, the formula for pi given by the French mathematician [[Franciscus Vieta]] (1540-1603) fell halfway between Zu's approximations.\n\n===''The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art''===\n''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', the title of which first appeared by 179 AD on a bronze inscription, was edited and commented on by the 3rd century mathematician [[Liu Hui]] from the Kingdom of [[Cao Wei]]. This book included many problems where geometry was applied, such as finding surface areas for squares and circles, the volumes of solids in various three-dimensional shapes, and included the use of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. The book provided illustrated proof for the Pythagorean theorem,<ref name=\"needham volume 3 22\">Needham, Volume 3, 22.</ref> contained a written dialogue between of the earlier [[Duke of Zhou]] and Shang Gao on the properties of the right angle triangle and the Pythagorean theorem, while also referring to the astronomical [[gnomon]], the circle and square, as well as measurements of heights and distances.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 21\">Needham, Volume 3, 21.</ref> The editor Liu Hui listed pi as 3.141014 by using a 192 sided [[polygon]], and then calculated pi as 3.14159 using a 3072 sided polygon. This was more accurate than Liu Hui's contemporary [[Wang Fan]], a mathematician and astronomer from [[Eastern Wu]], would render pi as 3.1555 by using <sup>142</sup>\u2044<sub>45</sub>.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 100\">Needham, Volume 3, 100.</ref> Liu Hui also wrote of mathematical [[surveying]] to calculate distance measurements of depth, height, width, and surface area. In terms of solid geometry, he figured out that a wedge with rectangular base and both sides sloping could be broken down into a pyramid and a [[tetrahedral]] wedge.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 98 99\">Needham, Volume 3, 98&ndash;99.</ref> He also figured out that a wedge with [[trapezoid]] base and both sides sloping could be made to give two tetrahedral wedges separated by a pyramid.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 98 99\"/> Furthermore, Liu Hui described [[Cavalieri's principle]] on volume, as well as [[Gaussian elimination]]. From the ''Nine Chapters'', it listed the following geometrical formulas that were known by the time of the Former Han Dynasty (202 BCE&ndash;9 CE).\n\n'''Areas for the'''<ref name=\"needham volume 3 98\">Needham, Volume 3, 98.</ref>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n*Square\n*Rectangle\n*Circle\n*[[Isosceles triangle]]\n{{col-4}}\n*[[Rhomboid]]\n*[[Trapezoid]]\n*Double trapezium\n*Segment of a circle\n*Annulus ('ring' between two concentric circles)\n{{col-4}}\n{{col-4}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''Volumes for the'''<ref name=\"needham volume 3 98 99\" />\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n*Parallelepiped with two square surfaces\n*Parallelepiped with no square surfaces\n*Pyramid\n*[[Frustum]] of pyramid with square base\n*Frustum of pyramid with rectangular base of unequal sides\n{{col-4}}\n*Cube\n*[[Prism (geometry)|Prism]]\n*Wedge with rectangular base and both sides sloping\n*Wedge with trapezoid base and both sides sloping\n*[[Tetrahedral]] wedge\n{{col-4}}\n*Frustum of a wedge of the second type (used for applications in engineering)\n*Cylinder\n*Cone with circular base\n*Frustum of a cone\n*Sphere\n{{col-4}}\n{{col-end}}\nContinuing the geometrical legacy of ancient China, there were many later figures to come, including the famed astronomer and mathematician [[Shen Kuo]] (1031-1095 CE), [[Yang Hui]] (1238-1298) who discovered [[Pascal's Triangle]], [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562-1633), and many others.\n\n==Islamic Golden Age==\n{{see also|Islamic mathematics}}\n[[Image:Image-Al-Kit\u0101b al-mu\u1e2bta\u1e63ar f\u012b \u1e25is\u0101b al-\u011fabr wa-l-muq\u0101bala.jpg|thumb|Page from the ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Al-Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah]]'']]\nBy the beginning of the 9th century, the \"[[Islamic Golden Age]]\" flourished,  the establishment of the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]] marking a separate tradition of [[science in the medieval Islamic world]], building not only Hellenistic but also on [[Indian influence on Islamic science|Indian]] sources.\n\nAlthough the Islamic mathematicians are most famed for their work on [[algebra]], [[number theory]] and [[number system]]s, they also made considerable contributions to geometry, [[trigonometry]] and mathematical [[astronomy]], and were responsible for the development of [[algebraic geometry]].\n\n[[Al-Mahani]] (born 820) conceived the idea of reducing geometrical problems such as duplicating the cube to problems in algebra. [[Al-Karaji]] (born 953) completely freed algebra from geometrical operations and replaced them with the [[arithmetic]]al type of operations which are at the core of algebra today.\n\n[[Th\u0101bit ibn Qurra]] (known as Thebit in [[Latin]]) (born 836) contributed to a number of areas in mathematics, where he played an important role in preparing the way for such important mathematical discoveries as the extension of the concept of number to ([[positive number|positive]]) [[real number]]s, [[integral calculus]], theorems in [[spherical trigonometry]], [[analytic geometry]], and [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. In astronomy Thabit was one of the first reformers of the [[Ptolemaic system]], and in mechanics he was a founder of [[statics]]. An important geometrical aspect of Thabit's work was his book on the composition of ratios. In this book, Thabit deals with arithmetical operations applied to ratios of geometrical quantities. The Greeks had dealt with geometric quantities but had not thought of them in the same way as numbers to which the usual rules of arithmetic could be applied. By introducing arithmetical operations on quantities previously regarded as geometric and non-numerical, Thabit started a trend which led eventually to the generalisation of the number concept.\n\nIn some respects, Thabit is critical of the ideas of Plato and Aristotle, particularly regarding motion. It would seem that here his ideas are based on an acceptance of using arguments concerning motion in his geometrical arguments. Another important contribution Thabit made to [[geometry]] was his generalization of the [[Pythagorean theorem]], which he extended from [[special right triangles]] to all [[triangle]]s in general, along with a general [[mathematical proof|proof]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sayili | first1 = Aydin | year = 1960 | title = Thabit ibn Qurra's Generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem | url = | journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 35\u201337 | doi=10.1086/348837}}</ref>\n\n[[Ibrahim ibn Sinan]] ibn Thabit (born 908), who introduced a method of [[integral|integration]] more general than that of [[Archimedes]], and [[al-Quhi]] (born 940) were leading figures in a revival and continuation of Greek higher geometry in the Islamic world. These mathematicians, and in particular [[Ibn al-Haytham]], studied [[optics]] and investigated the optical properties of mirrors made from [[conic section]]s.\n\nAstronomy, time-keeping and [[geography]] provided other motivations for geometrical and trigonometrical research. For example, Ibrahim ibn Sinan and his grandfather [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] both studied curves required in the construction of sundials.

A prime example of  is the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|Basilica di San Lorenzo]] in [[Florence]] by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (1377\u20131446).<ref>Howard Saalman. ''Filippo Brunelleschi: The Buildings''. (London: Zwemmer, 1993).</ref>\n\nIn c. 1413 [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]  demonstrated the geometrical method of perspective, used today by artists, by painting the outlines of various [[Florence|Florentine]] buildings onto a mirror. \nSoon after, nearly every artist in Florence and in Italy used geometrical perspective in their paintings,<ref>\"...and these works (of perspective by Brunelleschi) were the means of arousing the minds of the other craftsmen, who afterwords devoted themselves to this with great zeal.\"<br>Vasari's ''Lives of the Artists'' Chapter on Brunelleschi</ref> notably [[Masolino da Panicale]] and [[Donatello]].  [[Melozzo da Forl\u00ec]] first used the technique of upward foreshortening (in Rome, [[Loreto (AN)|Loreto]], [[Forl\u00ec]] and others), and was celebrated for that. Not only was perspective a way of showing depth, it was also a new method of [[Composition (visual arts)|composing]] a painting. Paintings began to show a single, unified scene, rather than a combination of several.\n\nAs shown by the quick proliferation of accurate perspective paintings in Florence, Brunelleschi likely understood (with help from his friend the mathematician [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli|Toscanelli]]),<ref>\"Messer Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli, having returned from his studies, invited Filippo with other friends to supper in a garden, and the discourse falling on mathematical subjects, Filippo formed a friendship with him and learned geometry from him.\"<br>Vasarai's ''Lives of the Artists'', Chapter on Brunelleschi</ref> but did not publish, the mathematics behind perspective. Decades later, his friend [[Leon Battista Alberti]] wrote ''[[De pictura]]'' (1435/1436), a treatise on proper methods of showing distance in painting based on Euclidean geometry. Alberti was also trained in the science of optics through the school of Padua and under the influence of [[Biagio Pelacani da Parma]] who studied Alhazen's ''Optics'.\n\n[[Piero della Francesca]] elaborated on Della Pittura in his ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]]'' in the 1470s. Alberti had limited himself to figures on the ground plane and giving an overall basis for perspective. Della Francesca fleshed it out, explicitly covering solids in any area of the picture plane. Della Francesca also started the now common practice of using illustrated figures to explain the mathematical concepts, making his treatise easier to understand than Alberti's. Della Francesca was also the first to accurately draw the [[Platonic solids]] as they would appear in perspective.\n\nPerspective remained, for a while, the domain of Florence. [[Jan van Eyck]], among others, was unable to create a consistent structure for the converging lines in paintings, as in London's [[The Arnolfini Portrait]], because he was unaware of the theoretical breakthrough just then occurring in Italy. However he achieved very subtle effects by manipulations of scale in his interiors. Gradually, and partly through the movement of academies of the arts, the Italian techniques became part of the training of artists across Europe, and later other parts of the world.\nThe culmination of these Renaissance traditions finds its ultimate synthesis in the research of the architect, geometer, and optician [[Girard Desargues]] on perspective, optics and projective geometry.\n\nThe ''[[Vitruvian Man]]''  by [[Leonardo da Vinci]](c. 1490)<ref>The Secret Language of the Renaissance - Richard Stemp</ref> depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and inscribed in a circle and square.  The drawing is based on the correlations of ideal [[Body proportions|human proportions]] with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] in Book III of his treatise ''[[De Architectura]]''.\n\n==Modern geometry==\n\n===The 17th century===\n[[Image:Descartes Discourse on Method.png|thumb|[[Discourse on Method]] by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]]]\nIn the early 17th century, there were two important developments in geometry. The first and most important was the creation of [[analytic geometry]], or geometry with [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] and [[equation]]s, by Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) and [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601\u20131665). This was a necessary precursor to the development of [[calculus]] and a precise quantitative science of [[physics]]. The second geometric development of this period was the systematic study of [[projective geometry]] by [[Girard Desargues]] (1591\u20131661). Projective geometry is the study of geometry without measurement, just the study of how points align with each other. There had been some early work in this area by Hellenistic geometers, notably [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] (c. 340). The greatest flowering of the field occurred with [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] (1788\u20131867).\n\nIn the late 17th century, calculus was developed independently and almost simultaneously by [[Isaac Newton]] (1642\u20131727) and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646\u20131716). This was the beginning of a new field of mathematics now called [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Though not itself a branch of geometry, it is applicable to geometry, and it solved two families of problems that had long been almost intractable: finding tangent lines to odd curves, and finding areas enclosed by those curves. The methods of calculus reduced these problems mostly to straightforward matters of computation.\n\n===The 18th and 19th centuries===\n\n====Non-Euclidean geometry====\nThe very old problem of proving Euclid\u2019s Fifth Postulate, the \"[[Parallel Postulate]]\", from his first four postulates had never been forgotten. Beginning not long after Euclid, many attempted demonstrations were given, but all were later found to be faulty, through allowing into the reasoning some principle which itself had not been proved from the first four postulates. Though Omar Khayy\u00e1m was also unsuccessful in proving the parallel postulate, his criticisms of Euclid's theories of parallels and his proof of properties of figures in non-Euclidean geometries contributed to the eventual development of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. By 1700 a great deal had been discovered about what can be proved from the first four, and what the pitfalls were in attempting to prove the fifth. [[Saccheri]], [[Johann Heinrich Lambert|Lambert]], and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] each did excellent work on the problem in the 18th century, but still fell short of success. In the early 19th century, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[J\u00e1nos Bolyai|Johann Bolyai]], and [[Lobatchewsky]], each independently, took a different approach. Beginning to suspect that it was impossible to prove the Parallel Postulate, they set out to develop a self-consistent geometry in which that postulate was false. In this they were successful, thus creating the first non-Euclidean geometry. By 1854, [[Bernhard Riemann]], a student of Gauss, had applied methods of calculus in a ground-breaking study of the intrinsic (self-contained) geometry of all smooth surfaces, and thereby found a different non-Euclidean geometry. This work of Riemann later became fundamental for [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]].\n[[Image:Newton-WilliamBlake.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Blake]]'s \"Newton\" is a demonstration of his opposition to the 'single-vision' of [[scientific materialism]]; here, [[Isaac Newton]] is shown as 'divine geometer' (1795)]]\nIt remained to be proved mathematically that the non-Euclidean geometry was just as self-consistent as Euclidean geometry, and this was first accomplished by [[Eugenio Beltrami|Beltrami]] in 1868. With this, non-Euclidean geometry was established on an equal mathematical footing with Euclidean geometry.\n\nWhile it was now known that different geometric theories were mathematically possible, the question remained, \"Which one of these theories is correct for our physical space?\" The mathematical work revealed that this question must be answered by physical experimentation, not mathematical reasoning, and uncovered the reason why the experimentation must involve immense (interstellar, not earth-bound) distances. With the development of relativity theory in physics, this question became vastly more complicated.\n\n====Introduction of mathematical rigor====\nAll the work related to the Parallel Postulate revealed that it was quite difficult for a geometer to separate his logical reasoning from his intuitive understanding of physical space, and, moreover, revealed the critical importance of doing so. Careful examination had uncovered some logical inadequacies in Euclid's reasoning, and some unstated geometric principles to which Euclid sometimes appealed. This critique paralleled the crisis occurring in calculus and analysis regarding the meaning of infinite processes such as convergence and continuity. In geometry, there was a clear need for a new set of axioms, which would be complete, and which in no way relied on pictures we draw or on our intuition of space. Such axioms, now known as [[Hilbert's axioms]], were given by [[David Hilbert]] in 1894 in his dissertation ''Grundlagen der Geometrie'' (''Foundations of Geometry''). Some other complete sets of axioms had been given a few years earlier, but did not match Hilbert's in economy, elegance, and similarity to Euclid's axioms.\n\n====Analysis situs, or topology====\nIn the mid-18th century, it became apparent that certain progressions of mathematical reasoning recurred when similar ideas were studied on the number line, in two dimensions, and in three dimensions. Thus the general concept of a metric space was created so that the reasoning could be done in more generality, and then applied to special cases. This method of studying calculus- and analysis-related concepts came to be known as analysis situs, and later as [[topology]]. The important topics in this field were properties of more general figures, such as connectedness and boundaries, rather than properties like straightness, and precise equality of length and angle measurements, which had been the focus of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry. Topology soon became a separate field of major importance, rather than a sub-field of geometry or analysis.\n\n===The 20th century===\nDevelopments in [[algebraic geometry]] included the study of curves and surfaces over [[finite field]]s as demonstrated by the works of among others [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]], [[Alexander Grothendieck]], and [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] as well as over the real or complex numbers. [[Finite geometry]] itself, the study of spaces with only finitely many points, found applications in [[coding theory]] and [[cryptography]]. With the advent of the computer, new disciplines such as [[computational geometry]] or [[digital geometry]] deal with geometric algorithms, discrete representations of geometric data, and so forth.\n\n==Timeline==\n{{main|Timeline of geometry}}\n\n==See also==\n{{wikisource|Flatland}}\n* ''[[Flatland]]'', a book by \"A.

W. Bush series}}\n'''George Herbert Walker Bush''' (born June 12, 1924) is an American politician who served as the 41st [[President of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993. Prior to assuming the presidency, Bush served as the 43rd [[Vice President of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he had previously been a Congressman, Ambassador and [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. During his career in [[public sector|public service]], he was known simply as George Bush; since 2001, he has often been referred to as \"George H. W. Bush\", \"Bush 41\", or \"George Bush Senior\" in order to distinguish him from his eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], the 43rd president of the United States. He is the nation's oldest [[Living Presidents of the United States|living president and vice president]], as well as the [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|longest-lived president]] in history.\n\nA member of the [[Bush family]], he was born in [[Milton, Massachusetts]] to [[Prescott Bush]] and Dorothy Walker Bush. Following the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, Bush postponed his university studies, enlisted in the [[U.S. Navy]] on his 18th birthday, and became the youngest [[naval aviator|aviator]] in the U.S. Navy at the time. He served until September 1945, then attended [[Yale University]]. Graduating in 1948, he moved his family to [[West Texas]], where he entered the [[oil business]] and became a millionaire by the age of 40 in 1964. Soon after founding his own oil company, Bush became involved in politics and won election to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from [[Texas' 7th congressional district|Texas' 7th district]] in 1966. In 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Bush as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]], and in 1973, Bush became the [[Chairman of the Republican National Committee]]. The following year, President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Bush as the ambassador to [[China]] and later reassigned Bush to the position of [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. Bush ran for president in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]] but was defeated in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980|Republican primary]] by [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan chose Bush as his running mate, and Bush became vice president after the Reagan\u2013Bush ticket won the 1980 election. During his eight-year tenure as vice president, Bush headed administration task forces on deregulation and fighting the [[War on Drugs]].\n\nIn [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]], Bush ran [[George H. W. Bush presidential campaign, 1988|a successful campaign to succeed Reagan as President]], defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent [[Michael Dukakis]]. [[Foreign policy]] drove the Bush presidency: [[military operations]] were conducted [[United States invasion of Panama|in Panama]] and [[Gulf War|the Persian Gulf]]; the [[Berlin Wall]] fell in 1989, and the [[Soviet Union]] dissolved two years later. Although the agreement was not ratified until after he left office, Bush also signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which created a [[trade bloc]] consisting of the United States, [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]. Domestically, Bush [[Read my lips: no new taxes|reneged on a 1988 campaign promise]] and, after a struggle with Congress, signed an increase in taxes that Congress had passed. In the wake of a weak recovery from an [[Early 1990s recession|economic recession]], along with continuing budget deficits and the diminution of foreign politics as a major issue in a post-Cold War [[political climate]], he lost the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]].\n\nBush left office in 1993. His [[George Bush Presidential Library|presidential library]] was dedicated in 1997, and he has been active\u2014often alongside Bill Clinton\u2014in various humanitarian activities. With George W. Bush's victory in the 2000 presidential election, Bush and his son became the second father\u2013son combination to serve as president, following [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]]. Bush's second son, [[Jeb Bush]], served as the [[List of Governors of Florida|43rd]] Governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007.\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{See also|Bush family}}\n[[File:George H W Bush at Age One and One-Half, ca 1925.gif|thumb|left|upright|George H.

At $220&nbsp;billion in 1990, the deficit had tripled since 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the [[101st United States Congress|Democratic controlled Congress]] to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut [[government spending]], and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to [[income tax|raise taxes]], Bush faced problems when it came to consensus building.<ref name=\"msn\"/>\n\nIn the wake of a struggle with Congress, Bush was forced by the Democratic majority to raise tax revenues; as a result, many Republicans felt betrayed because Bush had promised \"no new taxes\" in his 1988 campaign. Perceiving a means of revenge, Republican congressmen defeated Bush's proposal, which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500&nbsp;billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and gave way to a sharp [[United States Presidential approval rating|decrease in popularity]]. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill.<ref name=\"msn\"/> Near the end of the [[101st United States Congress|101st Congress]], the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the [[capital gains tax]], Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be a turning point in the Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.<ref name=\"ea\"/>\n\n[[File:Bush I approval rating.png|thumb|left|Bush's approval ratings (red) compared to his disapproval ratings (blue) for his four-year presidency]]\nComing at around the same time as the budget deal, America entered into a mild recession, lasting for six months. Many government programs, such as welfare, increased.<ref name=\"msn\"/> As the unemployment rate edged upward in 1991, Bush signed a bill providing additional benefits for unemployed workers.<ref name=\"ea\"/> The year 1991 was marked by many corporate reorganizations, which laid off a substantial number of workers. Many now unemployed were Republicans and independents, who had believed that their jobs were secure.\n\nBy his second year in office, Bush was told by his economic advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed that he had done everything necessary to ensure his reelection. By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported that 14.2% of all Americans [[poverty rate|lived in poverty]].<ref name=\"ea\"/> At a press conference in 1990, Bush told reporters that he found foreign policy more enjoyable.<ref name=\"msn\"/>\n\n==== Education ====\nOn April 5, 1989, Bush submitted to Congress the Educational Excellence Act of 1989, a seven program education legislative proposal with the intent of achieving \"a better-educated America.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/272|title=Message to the Congress Transmitting Proposed Legislation on Educational Excellence|date=April 5, 1989|publisher=George H.

The agreement would eliminate the majority of [[tariff]]s on products that were traded among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This would encourage trade among the countries. The treaty also restricted patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and outlined the removal of investment restrictions among the three countries.<ref name=\"fedex\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fedex.com/us/customersupport/ftn/faq/nafta.html?link=4 |publisher=Federal Express|title=Frequently Asked Questions: NAFTA|accessdate=April 11, 2008}}</ref> President Bush announced the completion of NAFTA during a Rose Garden appearance on August 12, 1992, calling it the \"beginning of a new era\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/08/12/Bush-announces-new-trade-pact-with-Mexico/2321509303014/|title=Bush announces new trade pact with Mexico|first=Helen|last=Thomas|publisher=UPI|date=August 12, 1992}}</ref>\n\nThe agreement came under heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA resulted in a loss of American jobs.<ref name=\"msn\"/> NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according to the Bush administration, the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding a situation in which the president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change.<ref name=\"nafta labor\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/nafta/nafta0401-04.htm|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=April 11, 2008|title= The NAFTA Labor Side Accord}}</ref> While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress.

Interest in Berkeley's work increased after World War&nbsp;II because he tackled many of the issues of paramount interest to philosophy in the 20th century, such as the problems of perception, the difference between primary and secondary qualities, and the importance of language.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=Colin |editor1-last=Turbayne|title=Berkeley: critical and interpretive essays|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RExF10reT9wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Turbayne#v=onepage&q&f=false |year=1982 |month= |origyear= |publisher= University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis, MN |accessdate=30 May 2011|isbn=978-0-8166-1065-5}}</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Ireland ===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}\nBerkeley was born at his family home, [[Dysart Castle]], near [[Thomastown]], [[County Kilkenny]], Ireland, the eldest son of William Berkeley, a [[Cadet (genealogy)|cadet]] of the noble family of [[Berkeley family|Berkeley]]. Little is known of his mother.  He was educated at [[Kilkenny College]] and attended [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a Scholar]] in 1702, earning a bachelor's degree in 1704 and completing a master's degree in 1707. He remained at Trinity College after completion of his degree as a tutor and Greek lecturer.\n\nHis earliest publication was on mathematics, but the first that brought him notice was his ''[[s:An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision|An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision]]'', first published in 1709. In the essay, Berkeley examines visual distance, magnitude, position and problems of sight and touch. While this work raised much controversy at the time, its conclusions are now accepted as an established part of the theory of optics.\n\nThe next publication to appear was the ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' in 1710, which had great success and gave him a lasting reputation, though few accepted his theory that nothing exists outside the mind. This was followed in 1713 by ''[[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]'', in which he propounded his system of philosophy, the leading principle of which is that the world, as represented by our senses, depends for its existence on being perceived.\n\nFor this theory, the ''Principles'' gives the exposition and the ''Dialogues'' the defence. One of his main objectives was to combat the prevailing [[materialism]] of his time. The theory was largely received with ridicule, while even those such as [[Samuel Clarke]] and [[William Whiston]], who did acknowledge his \"extraordinary genius,\" were nevertheless convinced that his first principles were false.\n\n=== England and Europe ===\nShortly afterwards, Berkeley visited England and was received into the circle of [[Joseph Addison|Addison]], [[Alexander Pope|Pope]] and [[Richard Steele|Steele]]. In the period between 1714 and 1720, he interspersed his academic endeavours with periods of extensive travel in Europe, including one of the most extensive Grand Tours of the length and breadth of Italy ever undertaken.<ref>[[Edward Chaney]], 'George Berkeley's Grand Tours: The Immaterialist as Connoisseur of Art and Architecture', in E. Chaney, ''The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance,'' 2nd ed. London, Routledge. 2000 {{ISBN|0714644749}}</ref> In 1721, he took [[Holy Orders]] in the [[Church of Ireland]], earning his doctorate in [[divinity]], and once again chose to remain at Trinity College Dublin, lecturing this time in Divinity and in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. In 1721/2 he was made [[Dean of Dromore]] and, in 1724, [[Dean of Derry]].\n\nIn 1723, following her violent quarrel with [[Jonathan Swift]], who had been her intimate friend for many years, [[Esther Vanhomrigh]]  (for whom Swift had created the nickname \"Vanessa\") named Berkeley her co-heir along with the barrister [[Robert Marshall (Irish judge)|Robert Marshall]]; her choice of legatees caused a good deal of surprise since she did not know either of them well, although Berkeley as a very young man had known her father. Swift said generously that he did not grudge Berkeley his inheritance, much of which vanished in a lawsuit in any event. A story that Berkeley and Marshall disregarded a condition of the inheritance that they must publish the correspondence between Swift and Vanessa is probably untrue.\n\nIn 1725, he began the project of founding a college in [[Bermuda]] for training ministers and missionaries in the colony, in pursuit of which he gave up his deanery with its income of \u00a31100.\n\n=== Marriage and America ===\nIn 1728, he married Anne Forster, daughter of [[John Forster (Chief Justice)|John Forster]], [[Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas]], and his first wife Rebecca Monck. He then went to America on a salary of \u00a3100 per annum. He landed near [[Newport, Rhode Island]], where he bought a plantation at [[Middletown, Rhode Island|Middletown]]{{spaced ndash}}the famous \"[[Whitehall Museum House|Whitehall]]\". It has been claimed that \"he introduced [[Palladianism]] into America by borrowing a design from [William] Kent's ''Designs of Inigo Jones'' for the door-case of his house in Rhode Island, Whitehall.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} He also brought to New England [[John Smybert|John Smibert]], the British artist he \"discovered\" in Italy, who is generally regarded as the founding father of American portrait painting.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Smibert|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Smibert|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref> Meanwhile, he drew up plans for the ideal city he planned to build on Bermuda.<ref>E. Chaney, \"George Berkeley's Grand Tours\",''Evolution of the Grand Tour'', p. 324</ref> He lived at the plantation while he waited for funds for his college to arrive. The funds, however, were not forthcoming, and in 1732 he left America and returned to London. He and Anne had four children who survived infancy: Henry, George, William and Julia, and at least two other children who died in infancy. William's death in 1751 was a great cause of grief to his father.\n\n=== Humanitarian work ===\nWhile living in London's Saville Street, he took part in efforts to create a home for the city's abandoned children. The [[Foundling Hospital]] was founded by [[Royal Charter]] in 1739, and Berkeley is listed as one of its original governors. In 1734, he was appointed [[Bishop of Cloyne]] in Ireland, a position he was to hold until his death. Soon afterwards, he published ''[[Alciphron, or The Minute Philosopher]]'', directed against both [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and [[Bernard de Mandeville]]; and in 1735\u201337 ''The Querist''.<ref>{{Cite book |last= |first= |year=1750 |title=The Querist, Containing, Several Queries, Proposed to the Consideration of the Public by the Bishop of Cloyne |publisher= George Faulkner |place=Dublin|edition= Third with Additions |page=2 |url=https://archive.org/stream/ldpd_9168945_000#page/n1/mode/2up|accessdate=13 June 2016 |via= Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\n=== Last works ===\nHis last two publications were ''Siris: A Chain of Philosophical Reflexions and Inquiries Concerning the Virtues of Tarwater, And divers other Subjects connected together and arising one from another'' (1744) and ''Further Thoughts on Tar-water'' (1752). [[Pine tar]] is an effective antiseptic and disinfectant when applied to cuts on the skin, but Berkeley argued for the use of pine tar as a broad panacea for diseases. His 1744 work on tar-water sold more copies than any of his other books during Berkeley's lifetime.<ref name=\"SEP\"/>\n\nHe remained at Cloyne until 1752, when he retired. With his wife and daughter Julia he went to Oxford to live with his son George and supervise his education.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/berkeley/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Downing|first=Lisa|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2013}}</ref> He died soon afterward and was buried in [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]]. His affectionate disposition and genial manners made him much loved and held in warm regard by many of his contemporaries. Anne outlived her husband by many years, and died in 1786.<ref>Pope, in his ''Satires, Epistles, and Odes of Horace'' (Epilogue to the Satires, Dialogue ii, line 73) refers to God granting \"To Berkeley every Virtue under Heaven\".</ref>\n\n== Contributions to philosophy ==\n{{Main|Subjective idealism}}\n\n{{Quotation|According to Berkeley there are only two kinds of things: spirits and ideas. Spirits are simple, active beings which produce and perceive ideas; ideas are passive beings which are produced and perceived.<ref>Bettcher T.M. ''Berkeley: A Guide for the Perplexed''. [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum Publishing]], 2008. p. 14.</ref> }}\n\nThe use of the concepts of \"spirit\" and \"idea\" is central in Berkeley's philosophy. As used by him, these concepts are difficult to translate into modern terminology. His concept of \"spirit\" is close to the concept of \"conscious subject\" or of \"mind\", and the concept of \"idea\" is close to the concept of \"sensation\" or \"state of mind\" or \"conscious experience\".\n\nThus Berkeley denied the existence of matter as a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] substance, but did not deny the existence of physical objects such as apples or mountains. (\"''I do not argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend, either by sense or reflection. That the things I see with mine eyes and touch with my hands do exist, really exist, I make not the least question. The only thing whose existence we deny, is that which philosophers call matter or corporeal substance. And in doing of this, there is no damage done to the rest of mankind, who, I dare say, will never miss it.''\", ''Principles ''#35) This basic claim of Berkeley's thought, his \"idealism\", is sometimes and somewhat derisively called \"immaterialism\" or, occasionally, [[subjective idealism]]. In ''Principles #3,'' he wrote, using a combination of Latin and English, ''esse is percipi'' (to be is to be perceived), most often if slightly inaccurately attributed to Berkeley as the pure Latin phrase ''esse est percipi.''<ref>Fogelin, Robert ''Berkeley and the Principles of Human Knowledge''. [[Routledge]], 2001. p. 27.</ref> The phrase appears associated with him in authoritative philosophical sources, e.g., \"Berkeley holds that there are no such mind-independent things, that, in the famous phrase, esse est percipi (aut percipere) \u2013 to be is to be perceived (or to perceive).\"<ref name=\"SEP\">Downing, Lisa, \"George Berkeley\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), [[Edward N. Zalta]] (ed.) <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/berkeley/>. Retrieved 21 August 2013.</ref>\n\nHence, human knowledge is reduced to two elements: that of spirits and of ideas (''Principles'' #86). In contrast to ideas, a spirit cannot be perceived. A person's spirit, which perceives ideas, is to be comprehended intuitively by inward feeling or reflection (''Principles'' #89). For Berkeley, we have no direct 'idea' of spirits, albeit we have good reason to believe in the existence of other spirits, for their existence explains the purposeful regularities we find in experience.<ref>Fogelin, Robert ''Berkeley and the Principles of Human Knowledge''. [[Routledge]], 2001. p. 74-75.</ref> (\"''It is plain that we cannot know the existence of other spirits otherwise than by their operations, or the ideas by them excited in us''\", Dialogues #145). This is the solution that Berkeley offers to the [[problem of other minds]]. Finally, the order and purposefulness of the whole of our experience of the world and especially of nature overwhelms us into believing in the existence of an extremely powerful and intelligent spirit that causes that order. According to Berkeley, reflection on the attributes of that external spirit leads us to identify it with God. Thus a material thing such as an apple consists of a collection of ideas (shape, color, taste, physical properties, etc.) which are caused in the spirits of humans by the spirit of God.\n\n=== Theology ===\nA convinced adherent of Christianity, Berkeley believed God to be present as an immediate [[causality|cause]] of all our experiences.\n\n{{quote|He did not evade the question of the external source of the diversity of the [[sense data]] at the disposal of the human individual. He strove simply to show that the causes of sensations could not be things, because what we called things, and considered without grounds to be something different from our sensations, were built up wholly from sensations. There must consequently be some other external source of the inexhaustible diversity of sensations. The source of our sensations, Berkeley concluded, could only be God; He gave them to man, who had to see in them signs and symbols that carried God's word.<ref name=\"The Main Trends in Philosophy\">[[Teodor Oizerman|Oizerman T.I.]] [https://archive.org/details/TheMainTrendsInPhilosophy The Main Trends in Philosophy]. A Theoretical Analysis of the History of Philosophy. Moscow, 1988, p. 78.</ref>}}\n\nHere is Berkeley's proof of the existence of God:\n\n{{quote|Whatever power I may have over my own thoughts, I find the ideas actually perceived by Sense have not a like dependence on my [[Will (philosophy)|will]]. When in broad daylight I open my eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see or no, or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view; and so likewise as to the hearing and other senses; the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will. There is therefore some other Will or Spirit that produces them. (Berkeley. ''Principles'' #29)}}\n\nAs T.I. Oizerman explained:\n\n{{quote|Berkeley's [[Subjective idealism|mystic idealism]] (as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] aptly christened it) claimed that nothing separated man and God (except [[materialism|materialist]] misconceptions, of course), since nature or matter did not exist as a reality independent of consciousness. The revelation of God was directly accessible to man, according to this doctrine; it was the sense-perceived world, the world of man's sensations, which came to him from on high for him to decipher and so grasp the divine purpose.<ref name=\"The Main Trends in Philosophy\"/>}}\n\nBerkeley believed that God is not the distant engineer of [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] machinery that in the fullness of time led to the growth of a tree in the university quadrangle. Rather, the perception of the tree is an idea that God's mind has produced in the mind, and the tree continues to exist in the quadrangle when \"nobody\" is there, simply because God is an infinite [[mind]] that perceives all.\n\nThe philosophy of [[David Hume]] concerning causality and objectivity is an elaboration of another aspect of Berkeley's philosophy. [[A.A. Luce]], the most eminent Berkeley scholar of the 20th century, constantly stressed the continuity of Berkeley's philosophy. The fact that Berkeley returned to his major works throughout his life, issuing revised editions with only minor changes, also counts against any theory that attributes to him a significant [[volte-face]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Relativity arguments ===\n{{See also|Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous}}\n[[John Locke]] (Berkeley's predecessor) states that we define an object by its [[Primary/secondary quality distinction|primary and secondary qualities]]. He takes heat as an example of a secondary quality. If you put one hand in a bucket of cold water, and the other hand in a bucket of warm water, then put both hands in a bucket of lukewarm water, one of your hands is going to tell you that the water is cold and the other that the water is hot. Locke says that since two different objects (both your hands) perceive the water to be hot ''and'' cold, then the heat is not a quality of the water.\n\nWhile Locke used this argument to distinguish primary from secondary qualities, Berkeley extends it to cover primary qualities in the same way. For example, he says that size is not a quality of an object because the size of the object depends on the distance between the observer and the object, or the size of the observer. Since an object is a different size to different observers, then size is not a quality of the object. Berkeley rejects shape with a similar argument and then asks: if neither primary qualities nor secondary qualities are of the object, then how can we say that there is anything more than the qualities we observe?{{clarify|reason=are size and shape the only qualities in this context?|date=October 2016|}}\n\n=== New theory of vision ===\nIn his ''Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision'', Berkeley frequently criticised the views of the Optic Writers, a title that seems to include [[William Molyneux|Molyneux]], Wallis, [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]].<ref>Schwartz, R, 1994. Vision: Variations on some Berkeleian themes. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 54.</ref> In sections 1\u201351, Berkeley argued against the classical scholars of optics by holding that: ''spatial depth, as the distance that separates the perceiver from the perceived object is itself invisible''.  That is, we do not see space directly or deduce its form logically using the laws of optics.  Space for Berkeley is no more than a contingent expectation that visual and tactile sensations will follow one another in regular sequences that we come to expect through habit.\n\nBerkeley goes on to argue that visual cues, such as the perceived extension or 'confusion' of an object, can only be used to indirectly judge distance, because the viewer learns to associate visual cues with tactile sensations. Berkeley gives the following analogy regarding indirect distance perception: one perceives distance indirectly just as one perceives a person's embarrassment indirectly. When looking at an embarrassed person, we infer indirectly that the person is embarrassed by observing the red color on the person's face. We know through experience that a red face tends to signal embarrassment, as we've learned to associate the two.\n\nThe question concerning the visibility of space was central to the Renaissance [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] tradition and its reliance on classical optics in the development of pictorial representations of spatial depth. This matter was debated by scholars since the 11th-century Arab polymath and mathematician [[Alhazen]] (al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham) affirmed in experimental contexts the visibility of space. This issue, which was raised in Berkeley's theory of vision, was treated at length in the ''Phenomenology of Perception'' of Maurice [[Merleau-Ponty]], in the context of confirming the visual perception of spatial depth (''la profondeur''), and by way of refuting Berkeley's thesis.<ref>For recent studies on this topic refer to: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'La perception de la profondeur: [[Alhazen]], Berkeley et Merleau-Ponty', ''Oriens-Occidens: Cahiers du centre d'histoire des sciences et des philosophies arabes et m\u00e9di\u00e9vales'', [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] Vol. 5 (2004), pp. 171\u2013184.  See also: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'A Philosophical Perspective on Alhazen's Optics', ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'', Vol.15 (2005), pp. 189\u2013218 ([[Cambridge University Press]] journal).</ref>\n\nBerkeley wrote about the perception of size in addition to that of distance. He is frequently misquoted as believing in size-distance invariance \u2013 a view held by the Optic Writers. This idea is that we scale the image size according to distance in a geometrical manner. The error may have become commonplace because the eminent historian and psychologist [[Edwin Boring|E. G. Boring]] perpetuated it.<ref>Boring E. G., 1942. Sensation and perception in the history of experimental psychology. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, pp.223 and 298.</ref> In fact, Berkeley argued that the same cues that evoke distance also evoke size, and that we do not first see size and then calculate distance.<ref>Ross H. E., Plug, C., 1998. The history of size constancy and size illusions. In Walsh, V. & Kulikowski, J. (Eds) Perceptual constancy: Why things look as they do. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 499\u2013528.</ref> It is worth quoting Berkeley's words on this issue (Section 53):\n\n<blockquote>What inclines men to this mistake (beside the humour of making one see by geometry) is, that the same perceptions or ideas which suggest distance, do also suggest magnitude... I say they do not first suggest distance, and then leave it to the judgement to use that as a medium, whereby to collect the magnitude; but they have as close and immediate a connexion with the magnitude as with the distance; and suggest magnitude as independently of distance, as they do distance independently of magnitude.</blockquote>\n\n=== Philosophy of physics ===\n{{See also|De Motu (Berkeley's essay)}}\n\"Berkeley's works display his keen interest in natural philosophy [...] from his earliest writings (''Arithmetica'', 1707) to his latest (''Siris'', 1744). Moreover, much of his philosophy is shaped fundamentally by his engagement with the science of his time.\"<ref>{{Cite book|author= Lisa Downing| editor= Kenneth P.

He held that those who posited \"something unknown in a body of which they have no idea and which they call the principle of motion, are in fact simply stating that the principle of motion is unknown.\" Therefore, those who \"affirm that active force, action, and the principle of motion are really in bodies are adopting an opinion not based on experience.\"<ref>De Motu, in Berkeley, George, and Jessop, T.E. The Works of George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne. London: Thomas Nelson and Son Ltd., 1948\u20131957, 4:36\u201337</ref> Forces and gravity existed nowhere in the phenomenal world. On the other hand, if they resided in the category of \"soul\" or \"incorporeal thing\", they \"do not properly belong to physics\" as a matter. Berkeley thus concluded that forces lay beyond any kind of empirical observation and could not be a part of proper science.<ref>Downing, Lisa. Berkeley's Case Against Realism About Dynamics. In Robert G. Muehlmann (ed.), Berkeley's Metaphysics: Structural, Interpretive, and Critical Essays. The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995</ref> He proposed his theory of signs as a means to explain motion and matter without reference to the \"occult qualities\" of force and gravity.\n\n=== Berkeley's razor ===\n\n'''Berkeley's razor''' is a rule of reasoning proposed by the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] in his study of Berkeley's key scientific work ''De Motu''.<ref name=\"Berkeley's Philosophical Writings 1974\"/> Berkeley's razor is considered by Popper to be similar to [[Ockham's razor]] but \"more powerful\". It represents an extreme, [[empiricist]] view of scientific observation that states that the scientific method provides us with no true insight into the nature of the world. Rather, the scientific method gives us a variety of partial explanations about regularities that hold in the world and that are gained through experiment. The nature of the world, according to Berkeley, is only approached through properly [[metaphysical]] speculation and reasoning. Popper summarises Berkeley's razor as such:\n\n<blockquote>A general practical result \u2014 which I propose to call 'Berkeley's razor' \u2014 of [Berkeley's] analysis of physics allows us ''a priori'' to eliminate from physical science all [[Essentialism|essentialist]] explanations. If they have a mathematical and predictive content they may be admitted ''qua'' mathematical hypotheses (while their essentialist interpretation is eliminated). If not they may be ruled out altogether. This razor is sharper than Ockham's: ALL entities are ruled out except those which are perceived.<ref>Karl Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'', New York: Routledge, 2002, p. 171.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Philosophy of mathematics ===\nIn addition to his contributions to philosophy, Berkeley was also very influential in the development of [[mathematics]], although in a rather indirect sense. \"Berkeley was concerned with mathematics and its philosophical interpretation from the earliest stages of his intellectual life.\"<ref>{{Cite book|author= Douglas M.

In 1734, he published ''[[The Analyst]]'', subtitled ''A DISCOURSE Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician'', a critique of [[calculus]]. [[Florian Cajori]] called this treatise \"the most spectacular event of the century in the history of British mathematics.\"<ref>{{Cite book|author= [[Florian Cajori]] |title= A History of the Conceptions of Limits and Fluxions in Great Britain, from Newton to Woodhouse  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3YAVRAAACAAJ&dq=cajori+%22history+of+the+conceptions+of+limits%22 |publisher= BiblioBazaar |location= |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-1-143-05698-7}}</ref> However, a recent study suggests that Berkeley misunderstood Leibnizian calculus.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Katz | first1 = Mikhail\n | author1-link = Mikhail Katz\n | last2 = Sherry | first2 = David\n | author2-link = David Sherry (philosopher)\n | arxiv = 1205.0174\n | doi = 10.1007/s10670-012-9370-y\n | issue =\n | journal = [[Erkenntnis]]\n | pages =\n | title = Leibniz's Infinitesimals: Their Fictionality, Their Modern Implementations, and Their Foes from Berkeley to Russell and Beyond\n | volume =\n | year = 2012}}</ref> The mathematician in question is believed to have been either [[Edmond Halley]], or [[Isaac Newton]] himself\u2014though if to the latter, then the discourse was posthumously addressed, as Newton died in 1727. ''The Analyst'' represented a direct attack on the foundations and principles of [[calculus]] and, in particular, the notion of [[Method of Fluxions|fluxion]] or [[infinitesimal]] change, which Newton and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] used to develop the calculus. In his critique, Berkeley coined the phrase \"[[ghosts of departed quantities]]\", familiar to students of calculus. [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]]'s book [[From Here to Infinity (book)|''From Here to Infinity'']] captures the gist of his criticism.\n\nBerkeley regarded his criticism of calculus as part of his broader campaign against the religious implications of Newtonian mechanics{{spaced ndash}}as a defence of traditional Christianity against [[deism]], which tends to distance God from His worshipers. Specifically, he observed that both Newtonian and Leibnizian calculus employed infinitesimals sometimes as positive, nonzero quantities and other times as a number explicitly equal to zero. Berkeley's key point in \"The Analyst\" was that Newton's calculus (and the laws of motion based in calculus) lacked rigorous theoretical foundations. He claimed that\n<blockquote>\nIn every other Science Men prove their Conclusions by their Principles, and not their Principles by the Conclusions. But if in yours you should allow your selves this unnatural way of proceeding, the Consequence would be that you must take up with Induction, and bid adieu to Demonstration.

Berkeley, however, found it paradoxical that \"Mathematicians should deduce true Propositions from false Principles, be right in Conclusion, and yet err in the Premises.\" In ''The Analyst'' he endeavoured to show \"how Error may bring forth Truth, though it cannot bring forth Science.\"<ref>The Analyst, in Berkeley, George, and Jessop, T.E.

Print.</ref> and that people can obey different supreme authorities if there are more than one claims to the highest authority.\n\nBerkeley defends this thesis with a deductive proof stemming from the laws of nature. First, he establishes that because God is perfectly good, the end to which he commands humans must also be good, and that end must not benefit just one person, but the entire human race. Because these commands\u2014or laws\u2014if practiced, would lead to the general fitness of humankind, it follows that they can be discovered by the right reason\u2014for example, the law to never resist supreme power can be derived from reason because this law is \"the only thing that stands between us and total disorder\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, these laws can be called the [[Natural law|laws of nature]], because they are derived from God\u2014the creator of nature himself. \"These laws of nature include duties never to resist the supreme power, lie under oath\u2026or do evil so that good may come of it.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOne may view Berkeley\u2019s doctrine on Passive Obedience as a kind of 'Theological Utilitarianism', insofar as it states that we have a duty to uphold a moral code which presumably is working towards the ends of promoting the good of humankind. However, the concept of 'ordinary' Utilitarianism is fundamentally different in that it \"makes utility the one and only ''ground'' of obligation\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ditext.com/broad/berkeley.html|title=Berkeley's Theory of Morals|website=www.ditext.com|access-date=2016-05-27}}</ref>\u2014that is, Utilitarianism is concerned with whether particular actions are morally permissible in specific situations, while Berkeley\u2019s doctrine is concerned with whether or not we should follow moral rules in any and all circumstances. Whereas Utilitarianism might, for example, justify a morally impermissible act in light of the specific situation, Berkeley\u2019s doctrine of Passive Obedience holds that it is never morally permissible to not follow a moral rule, even when it seems like breaking that moral rule might achieve the happiest ends. Berkeley holds that even though sometimes, the consequences of an action in a specific situation might be bad, the general tendencies of that action benefits humanity.\n\nOther important sources for Berkeley's views on morality are ''[[Alciphron (book)|Alciphron]]'' (1732), especially dialogues I\u2013III, and the ''Discourse to Magistrates'' (1738).\"<ref>Jakapi, Roomet. \"Was Berkeley a [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]]?\" // Lemetti, Juhana and Piirim\u00e4e, Eva, eds.

Principles of Human Knowledge and Three Dialogues. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2009. </ref>  Berkeley says in his book called The Principles of Human Knowledge that \u201cthe ideas of sense are stronger, livelier, and clearer than those of the imagination; and they are also steady, orderly and coherent\u201d (Berkeley 18). From this we can tell that the things that we are perceiving are truly real rather than it just being a dream.\n\nAll knowledge comes from perception; what we perceive are ideas, not things in themselves; a thing in itself must be outside experience; so the world only consists of ideas and minds that perceive those ideas; a thing only exists so far as it perceives or is perceived.<ref name=\":1\">Buckingham, Will.\u201cTo Be Is To Be Perceived.\u201d The Philosophy Book: Big Ideas Simply Explained, DK Publishing, New York, NY, 2011, pp. 138\u2013141.</ref> Through this we can see that consciousness is considered something that exists to Berkeley due to its ability to perceive. \"'To be,' said of the object, means to be perceived; 'to be,' said of the subject, means to perceive or \"esse est percipi.\" \"<ref>The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. \u201cGeorge Berkeley.\u201d Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc., 6 Feb. 2012, http://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Berkeley. Accessed 15 Mar. 2017.</ref> \nBerkeley\u2019s ideas were somewhat controversial due to his argument's refuting [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]]' worldview, which was expanded upon by Locke, and the rejection of Berkeley\u2019s form of empiricism by several philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In Locke\u2019s worldview, \"the world causes the perceptual ideas we have of it by the way it interacts with our senses.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> This contradicts with Berkeley's worldview because not only does it suggest the existence of physical causes in the world, but in fact there is no physical world beyond our ideas. The only causes that exist in Berkeley\u2019s worldview are those that are a result of the use of the will.\n\nBerkeley\u2019s theory relies heavily on his form of [[empiricism]], which in turn relies heavily on the senses. His empiricism can be defined by five propositions: all significant words stand for ideas; all knowledge about our ideas; all ideas come from without or from within; if from without it must be by the senses, and they are called sensations, if from within they are the operations of the mind, and are called thoughts.<ref name=\":2\">Urmson, J.

Berkeley answers this by claiming that it is still being perceived and the consciousness that is doing the perceiving is [[God]]. This claim is the only thing holding up his argument which is \"depending for our knowledge of the world, and of the existence of other minds, upon a God that would never deceive us.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Berkeley\u2019s argument hinges upon an [[Omniscience|omniscient]], [[Omnipresence|omnipresent]] deity.\n\n== Influence ==\nBerkeley's ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' was published three years before the publication of [[Arthur Collier]]'s ''[[Clavis Universalis]]'', which made assertions similar to those of Berkeley's.<ref>{{Cite journal |year= 1852  |author= Reid T.  |authorlink=  Thomas Reid |author2= Ed. by William Hamilton |title= The Works of Thomas Reid, now fully collected  |place= [[Edinburgh]] |publisher= Maclachlan and Stewart |isbn= |url= https://archive.org/details/worksofthomasrei00reiduoft |accessdate= 1 December 2010 |postscript=&nbsp;&nbsp;see: \"Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man\" II:X }}, p. 287.</ref> However, there seemed to have been no influence or communication between the two writers.<ref>{{Cite journal\n|year= 1852\n |author= Reid T.\n |authorlink=  Thomas Reid\n |author2= Ed. by William Hamilton\n|title= The Works of Thomas Reid, now fully collected\n |place= Edinburgh\n |publisher= Maclachlan and Stewart\n |isbn=\n|url= https://archive.org/details/worksofthomasrei00reiduoft\n|accessdate= 1 December 2010\n|postscript=&nbsp;&nbsp;see: \"Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man\" VI:VII }}, p. 464.\n</ref>\n\nGerman philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] once wrote of him: \"Berkeley was, therefore, the first to treat the subjective starting-point really seriously and to demonstrate irrefutably its absolute necessity.

Along with Russell, he led the turn away from [[idealism]] in British philosophy, and became well known for his advocacy of [[common sense]] concepts, his contributions to [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]], and \"his exceptional personality and moral character\".<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/moore/ \"Moore, George Edward\"].

He was admired by and influential among other philosophers, and also by the [[Bloomsbury Group]], but is (unlike his colleague Russell) mostly unknown today outside of academic philosophy.  Moore's essays are known for their clear, circumspect writing style, and for his methodical and patient approach to philosophical problems. He was critical of modern philosophy for its lack of [[Philosophical progress|progress]], which he believed was in stark contrast to the dramatic advances in the [[natural sciences]] since the [[Renaissance]]. Among Moore's most famous works are his book ''[[Principia Ethica]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moore |first1=G.

He named this confusion the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. For example, an ethical argument may claim that if a thing has certain properties, then that thing is 'good.' A [[hedonism|hedonist]] may argue that 'pleasant' things are 'good' things. Other theorists may argue that 'complex' things are 'good' things. Moore contends that even if such arguments are correct, they do not provide definitions for the term 'good.' The property of 'goodness' cannot be defined. It can only be shown and grasped. Any attempt to define it (X is good if it has property Y) will simply shift the problem (Why is Y-ness good in the first place?).\n\n====Open-question argument====\n{{Main|Open-question argument}}\nMoore's [[argument]] for the indefinability of \"good\" (and thus for the fallaciousness of the \"naturalistic fallacy\") is often called the [[open-question argument]]; it is presented in [http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.13 \u00a713 of ''Principia Ethica'']. The argument hinges on the nature of statements such as \"Anything that is pleasant is also good\" and the possibility of asking questions such as \"Is it ''good'' that x is pleasant?\" According to Moore, these questions are ''open'' and these statements are ''significant''; and they will remain so no matter what is substituted for \"pleasure\". Moore concludes from this that any analysis of value is bound to fail. In other words, if value could be analysed, then such questions and statements would be trivial and obvious. Since they are anything but trivial and obvious, value must be indefinable.\n\nCritics of Moore's arguments sometimes claim that he is appealing to general puzzles concerning analysis (cf. the [[paradox of analysis]]), rather than revealing anything special about value. The argument clearly depends on the assumption that if \"good\" were definable, it would be an [[Logical truth|analytic truth]] about \"good,\" an assumption many contemporary moral realists like [[Richard Boyd]] and [[Peter Railton]] reject.  Other responses appeal to the [[Frege]]an distinction between [[sense and reference]], allowing that value concepts are special and ''sui generis'', but insisting that value properties are nothing but natural properties (this strategy is similar to that taken by [[physicalism|non-reductive materialists]] in [[philosophy of mind]]).\n\n====Good as indefinable====\nMoore contended that goodness cannot be analysed in terms of any other property. In ''[http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica Principia Ethica], ''he writes:\n\n: It may be true that all things which are good are also something else, just as it is true that all things which are yellow produce a certain kind of vibration in the light. And it is a fact, that Ethics aims at discovering what are those other properties belonging to all things which are good. But far too many philosophers have thought that when they named those other properties they were actually defining good; that these properties, in fact, were simply not \"other,\" but absolutely and entirely the same with goodness. ([http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.10#s10p3 \u00a7 10 \u00b6 3])\n\nTherefore, we cannot define \"good\" by explaining it in other words. We can only point to an ''action'' or a ''thing'' and say \"That is good.\" Similarly, we cannot describe to a person born totally blind exactly what yellow is. We can only show a sighted person a piece of yellow paper or a yellow scrap of cloth and say \"That is yellow.\"\n\n====Good as a non-natural property====\nIn addition to categorising \"good\" as indefinable, Moore also emphasized that it is a non-natural property. This means that it cannot be empirically or scientifically tested or verified - it is not within the bounds of \"natural science\".\n\n====Moral knowledge====\nMoore argued that once arguments based on the [[naturalistic fallacy]] had been discarded, questions of intrinsic goodness could only be settled by appeal to what he (following [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]]) called \"moral intuitions:\" [[self-evidence|self-evident]] propositions which recommend themselves to moral reflection, but which are not susceptible to either direct proof or disproof ([http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.45 PE \u00a7 45]). As a result of his view, he has often been described by later writers as an advocate of [[ethical intuitionism]]. Moore, however, wished to distinguish his view from the views usually described as \"Intuitionist\" when ''Principia Ethica'' was written:\n\n{{quotation|In order to express the fact that ethical propositions of my ''first'' class [propositions about what is good as an end in itself] are incapable of proof or disproof, I have sometimes followed Sidgwick's usage in calling them 'Intuitions.' But I beg that it may be noticed that I am not an 'Intuitionist,\u2019 in the ordinary sense of the term. Sidgwick himself seems never to have been clearly aware of the immense importance of the difference which distinguishes his Intuitionism from the common doctrine, which has generally been called by that name. The Intuitionist proper is distinguished by maintaining that propositions of my ''second'' class\u2014propositions which assert that a certain action is ''right'' or a ''duty''\u2014are incapable of proof or disproof by any enquiry into the results of such actions. I, on the contrary, am no less anxious to maintain that propositions of ''this'' kind are ''not'' 'Intuitions,\u2019 than to maintain that propositions of my ''first'' class ''are'' Intuitions.|G. E. Moore|[http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/preface#s0p5 ''Principia Ethica'', Preface \u00b6 5]}}\n\nMoore distinguished his view from the view of [[deontological ethics|deontological]] intuitionists, who held that \"intuitions\" could determine questions about what ''actions'' are right or required by [[duty]]. Moore, as a [[consequentialist]], argued that \"duties\" and moral rules could be determined by investigating the ''effects'' of particular actions or kinds of actions ([http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.89 PE \u00a7 89]), and so were matters for empirical investigation rather than direct objects of intuition ([http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.90 PE \u00a7 90]). On Moore's view, \"intuitions\" revealed not the rightness or wrongness of specific actions, but only what things were good in themselves, as ''ends to be pursued''.\n\n===Proof of an external world===\n{{Main|Here is one hand}}\nOne of the most important parts of Moore's philosophical development was his break from the [[idealism]] that dominated British philosophy (as represented in the works of his former teachers [[F. H. Bradley]] and [[J. M. E. McTaggart|John McTaggart]]), and his defence of what he regarded as a \"common sense\" form of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. In his 1925 essay \"[[A Defence of Common Sense]]\", he argued against idealism and [[scepticism]] toward the external world, on the grounds that they could not give reasons to accept that their metaphysical premises were more plausible than the reasons we have to accept the common sense claims about our knowledge of the world, which sceptics and idealists must deny. He famously put the point into dramatic relief with his 1939 essay \"Proof of an External World\", in which he gave a common sense argument against scepticism by raising his right hand and saying \"Here is one hand,\" and then raising his left and saying \"And here is another,\" then concluding that there are at least two external objects in the world, and therefore that he knows (by this argument) that an external world exists. Not surprisingly, not everyone inclined to sceptical doubts found Moore's method of argument entirely convincing; Moore, however, defends his argument on the grounds that sceptical arguments seem invariably to require an appeal to \"philosophical intuitions\" that we have considerably less reason to accept than we have for the common sense claims that they supposedly refute. (In addition to fueling Moore's own work, the \"Here is one hand\" argument also deeply influenced [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], who spent his last years working out a new approach to Moore's argument in the remarks that were published posthumously as ''[[On Certainty]]''.)\n\n===Moore's paradox===\nMoore is also remembered for drawing attention to the peculiar inconsistency involved in uttering a sentence such as \"It is raining but I do not believe it is raining.\"\u2014a puzzle which is now commonly called \"[[Moore's paradox]]\". The puzzle arises because it seems impossible for anyone to consistently ''assert'' such a sentence; but there doesn't seem to be any ''logical contradiction'' between \"It is raining\" and \"I don't believe that it is raining.\" because the former is a statement about the weather and the latter a statement about a person's belief about the weather, and it is perfectly logically possible that it may rain whilst a person does not believe that it is raining.\n\nIn addition to Moore's own work on the paradox, the puzzle also inspired a great deal of work by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who described the paradox as the most impressive philosophical insight that Moore had ever introduced. It is said that when Wittgenstein first heard this paradox one evening (which Moore had earlier stated in a lecture), he rushed round to Moore's lodgings, got him out of bed and insisted that Moore repeat the entire lecture to him.\n\n===Organic wholes===\nMoore\u2019s description of the principle of [[organic unity]] is extremely straightforward; nonetheless, and a variant on a pattern that began with Aristotle:\n\n: The value of a whole must not be assumed to be the same as the sum of the values of its parts (Principia, [http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.18 \u00a7 18]).\n\nAccording to Moore, a moral actor cannot survey the \"goodness\" inherent in the various parts of a situation, assign a value to each of them, and then generate a sum in order to get an idea of its total value. A moral scenario is a complex assembly of parts, and its total value is often created by the relations between those parts, and not by their individual value. The organic metaphor is thus very appropriate: biological organisms seem to have emergent properties which cannot be found anywhere in their individual parts. For example, a human brain seems to exhibit a capacity for thought when none of its neurons exhibit any such capacity. In the same way, a moral scenario can have a value far greater than the sum of its component parts.\n\nTo understand the application of the organic principle to questions of value, it is perhaps best to consider Moore\u2019s primary example, that of a consciousness experiencing a beautiful object. To see how the principle works, a thinker engages in \"reflective isolation\", the act of isolating a given concept in a kind of null-context and determining its intrinsic value. In our example, we can easily see that per ''sui'', beautiful objects and consciousnesses are not particularly valuable things. They might have some value, but when we consider the total value of a consciousness experiencing a beautiful object, it seems to exceed the simple sum of these values (Principia 18:2).\n\n==Works==\n[[Image:Grave of philosopher G.E.

The reverse process, by which just part of an existing definition is used itself as a new definition, is called '''[[abstraction]]'''; the new definition is called ''an&nbsp;abstraction'' and it is said to have been ''abstracted away from'' the existing definition.\n\nFor instance, consider the following:\n* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles, and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.\nA part of that definition may be singled out (using parentheses here):\n* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': (<span style=\"background:LightSalmon\">a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles</span>), and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.\nand with that part, an abstraction may be formed:\n* <span style=\"background:LightSalmon\">''a [[rectangle]]'': a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles.</span>\nThen, the definition of ''a&nbsp;square'' may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:\n* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': <span style=\"background:LightSalmon\">a rectangle</span> that has bounding sides which all have the same length.\n\nSimilarly, the definition of ''a&nbsp;square'' may be rearranged and another portion singled out:\n* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': (<span style=\"background:LightBlue\">a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length</span>), and that has interior angles which are all right angles.\nleading to the following abstraction:\n* <span style=\"background:LightBlue\">''a [[rhombus]]'': a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length.</span>\nThen, the definition of ''a&nbsp;square'' may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:\n* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': <span style=\"background:LightBlue\">a rhombus</span> that has interior angles which are all right angles.\n\nIn fact, the definition of ''a&nbsp;square'' may be recast in terms of both of the abstractions, where one acts as the genus and the other acts as the differentia:\n* ''a square'': <span style=\"background:LightSalmon\">a rectangle</span> that is <span style=\"background:LightBlue\">a rhombus</span>.\n* ''a square'': <span style=\"background:LightBlue\">a rhombus</span> that is <span style=\"background:LightSalmon\">a rectangle</span>.\nHence, abstraction is crucial in simplifying definitions.\n\n== Multiplicity ==\n\nWhen multiple definitions could serve equally well, then all such definitions apply simultaneously. Thus, ''a&nbsp;square'' is a member of both the genus ''<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#91;a&#93; rectangle</span>'' and the genus ''<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#91;a&#93; rhombus</span>''. In such a case, it is notationally convenient to consolidate the definitions into one definition that is expressed with multiple genera (and possibly no differentia, as in the following):\n* ''a square'': <span style=\"background:LightSalmon\">a rectangle</span> and <span style=\"background:LightBlue\">a rhombus</span>.\nor completely equivalently:\n* ''a square'': <span style=\"background:LightBlue\">a rhombus</span> and <span style=\"background:LightSalmon\">a rectangle</span>.\n\nMore generally, a collection of <math>n>1</math> equivalent definitions (each of which is expressed with one unique genus) can be recast as one definition that is expressed with <math>n</math> genera. Thus, the following:\n* ''a Definition'': a Genus<sub>1</sub> that is a Genus<sub>2</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>3</sub> and that is a&hellip; and that is a Genus<sub>n-1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>n</sub>, which has some non-genus Differentia.\n* ''a Definition'': a Genus<sub>2</sub> that is a Genus<sub>1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>3</sub> and that is a&hellip; and that is a Genus<sub>n-1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>n</sub>, which has some non-genus Differentia.\n* ''a Definition'': a Genus<sub>3</sub> that is a Genus<sub>1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>2</sub> and that is a&hellip; and that is a Genus<sub>n-1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>n</sub>, which has some non-genus Differentia.\n* &hellip;\n* ''a Definition'': a Genus<sub>n-1</sub> that is a Genus<sub>1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>2</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>3</sub> and that is a&hellip; and that is a Genus<sub>n</sub>, which has some non-genus Differentia.\n* ''a Definition'': a Genus<sub>n</sub> that is a Genus<sub>1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>2</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>3</sub> and that is a&hellip; and that is a Genus<sub>n-1</sub>, which has some non-genus Differentia.\ncould be recast as:\n* ''a Definition'': a Genus<sub>1</sub> and a Genus<sub>2</sub> and a Genus<sub>3</sub> and a&hellip; and a Genus<sub>n-1</sub> and a Genus<sub>n</sub>, which has some non-genus Differentia.\n\n== Structure ==\n\nA genus of a definition provides a means by which to specify an ''[[is-a|is-a relationship]]'':\n* A square is a rectangle, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&hellip;\n* A square is a rhombus, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&hellip;\n* A square is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&hellip;\n* A square is a plane figure, which is a&hellip;\n* A square is a&hellip;\nThe non-genus portion of the differentia of a definition provides a means by which to specify a ''[[has-a|has-a relationship]]'':\n* A square has an interior angle that is a right angle.\n* A square has a straight bounding side.\n* A square has a&hellip;\n\nWhen a system of definitions is constructed with genera and differentiae, the definitions can be thought of as nodes forming a [[hierarchy]] or\u2014more generally\u2014a [[directed acyclic graph]]; a node that has no [[Directed graph|predecessor]] is ''a&nbsp;most general definition''; each node along a directed path is ''more '''differentiated''''' (or ''more '''derived''''') than any one of its predecessors, and a node with no [[Directed graph|successor]] is ''a&nbsp;most differentiated'' (or ''a&nbsp;most derived'') definition.\n\nWhen a definition, ''S'', is the [[Directed graph|tail]] of each of its successors (that is, ''S'' has at least one successor and each [[Directed graph|direct successor]] of ''S'' is a most differentiated definition), then ''S'' is often called <span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">''the '''[[species]]'''''</span> of each of its successors, and each direct successor of ''S'' is often called <span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">''an '''[[individual]]'''''</span> (or <span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">''an '''[[entity]]'''''</span>) of the species ''S''; that is, the genus of an individual is synonymously called ''the&nbsp;species'' of that individual. Furthermore, the differentia of an individual is synonymously called <span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">''the [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]''</span> of that individual. For instance, consider the following definition:\n* ''&#91;the&#93; John Smith'': a human that has the name 'John&nbsp;Smith'.\nIn this case:\n* The whole definition is ''an&nbsp;individual''; that is, ''&#91;the&#93; John Smith'' is an individual.\n* The genus of ''&#91;the&#93; John Smith'' (which is \"a&nbsp;human\") may be called synonymously ''the&nbsp;species'' of ''&#91;the&#93; John Smith''; that is, ''&#91;the&#93; John Smith'' is an individual of the species ''&#91;a&#93; human''.\n* The differentia of ''&#91;the&#93; John Smith'' (which is \"that has the name 'John&nbsp;Smith'\") may be called synonymously ''the&nbsp;identity'' of ''&#91;the&#93; John Smith''; that is, ''&#91;the&#93; John Smith'' is identified among other individuals of the same species by the fact that ''&#91;the&#93; John Smith'' is the one \"that has the name 'John Smith'\".\n\nAs in that example, the identity itself (or some part of it) is often used to refer to the entire individual, a phenomenon that is known in [[linguistics]] as a ''[[pars pro toto|pars&nbsp;pro&nbsp;toto]] [[synecdoche]]''.\n\n{{Defining}}\n{{Ancient Greek philosophical concepts}}\n{{Aristotelianism |ideas}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Genus-differentia definition}}\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:Definition]]\n[[Category:Dichotomies]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of language]]\n[[Category:Abstraction]]\n[[Category:Difference]]", "sha1": "hr8hvlj6a12gri8gbg7a8r2rs3k0xj7"}}, {"title": "Firearm", "ns": "0", "id": "11966", "revision": {"id": "866179681", "parentid": "866176711", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T19:55:45Z", "contributor": {"username": "AnomieBOT", "id": "7611264"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Dating maintenance tags: {{Fact}}", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Refimprove|date=March 2018}}\n{{about|the projectile weapon|the firearm as a tool|Firearm (tool)|other uses}}\n\n[[File:US Navy 100714-N-4965F-174 Chief Mass Communication Specialist Paula Ludwick, assigned to Fleet Combat Camera Group Pacific, shoots at a target during a Navy Rifle Qualification Course.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[United States Navy|US Navy]] sailor fires a MK-18 rifle at a target.]]\n\nA '''firearm''' is a portable gun (a [[Gun barrel|barreled]] [[ranged weapon]]) that inflicts damage on targets by launching one or more [[projectile]]s driven by rapidly expanding high-pressure gas produced ''chemically'' by exothermic combustion ([[deflagration]]) of [[propellant]] within an ammunition [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0188S1QXU/|title=Association of Firearm Instructors - Glossary of Firearm Terms|last=Cole|first=Suzanne N.|date=November 19, 2016|website=|publisher=Association of Firearm Instructors|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/firearm |title= Merriam-Webster Dictionary, \"Firearm\" |publisher= Merriam-webster.com |date= 2012-08-31 |accessdate= 2014-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite dictionary|title= Firearm|dictionary= American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition= 4|year= 2000|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company}}{{cite dictionary|article= Firearm|dictionary= Collins English Dictionary \u2013 Complete and Unabridged|publisher= HarperCollins Publishers|year= 2003}}</ref>  If gas pressurization is achieved through ''mechanical'' [[gas compression]] rather than through chemical propellant combustion, then the gun is technically an [[air gun]], not a firearm.<ref name=atfairgun>[http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/firearms-technology.html#air-gun-regulation US Federal Govt] does not consider an air gun to be a firearm and does not regulate airguns as firearms</ref>\n\nThe first primitive firearms originated in 10th-century [[History of science and technology in China|China]] when [[bamboo]] tubes containing [[gunpowder]] and [[Lead shot|pellet]] projectiles were mounted on spears into the one-person-portable [[fire lance]],<ref name=Helaine>{{cite book|author= Helaine Selin|title= Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&pg=PA389|accessdate= 30 July 2013|date= 1 January 1997|publisher= Springer|isbn= 978-0-7923-4066-9|page= 389}}</ref>, which was later used as a shock weapon to good effect in the [[Siege of De'an]] in 1132.

The technology gradually spread through the rest of [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and Europe. Older firearms typically used [[Gunpowder|black powder]] as a [[propellant]], but modern firearms use [[smokeless powder]] or other propellants. Most modern firearms (with the notable exception of [[smoothbore]] [[shotgun]]s) have [[rifling |rifled]] barrels to impart spin to the [[projectile]] for improved flight stability.\n\nModern firearms can be described by their [[caliber]] (i.e. their bore diameter; this is given in millimeters or inches e.g. 7.5&nbsp;mm, .357 in.) or in the case of shotguns their [[Gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]] (e.g. 12 ga.); by the type of action employed (muzzle, breech, lever, bolt, pump, revolver, semi-automatic, automatic etc.) together with the usual means of deportment (hand-held or mechanical mounting). Further classification may make reference to the type of barrel used (rifled) and to the barrel length (24 inch), to the firing mechanism (e.g. [[matchlock]], [[wheellock]], [[flintlock]], [[percussion lock]]), to the design's primary intended use (e.g. hunting rifle), or to the commonly accepted name for a particular variation (e.g. [[Gatling gun]]). \n\nShooters aim firearms at their targets with [[hand-eye coordination]], using either [[iron sights]] or [[Telescopic sight| optical sight]]s.

There are two common types of handguns: [[revolvers]] and [[semi-automatic pistol]]s. Revolvers have a number of firing chambers or \"charge holes\" in a revolving cylinder; each chamber in the cylinder is loaded with a single cartridge or charge. Semi-automatic pistols have a single fixed firing chamber machined into the rear of the barrel, and a magazine so they can be used to fire more than one round. Each press of the trigger fires a cartridge, using the energy of the cartridge to activate the mechanism so that the next cartridge may be fired immediately. This is opposed to \"[[double-action]]\" revolvers which accomplish the same end using a mechanical action linked to the trigger pull.\n\nPrior to the 19th century, virtually all handguns were single-shot muzzleloaders.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} With the invention of the revolver in 1818, handguns capable of holding multiple rounds became popular. Certain designs of auto-loading pistol appeared beginning in the 1870s and had largely supplanted revolvers in military applications by the end of World War I. By the end of the 20th century, most handguns carried regularly by military, police and civilians were [[Semi-automatic pistol|semi-automatic]], although revolvers were still widely used. Generally speaking, military and police forces use semi-automatic pistols due to their high magazine capacities and ability to rapidly reload by simply removing the empty magazine and inserting a loaded one. Revolvers are very common among handgun hunters because revolver cartridges are usually more powerful than similar caliber semi-automatic pistol cartridges (which are designed for self-defense) and the strength, simplicity and durability of the revolver design is well-suited to outdoor use. Revolvers, especially in [[.22 LR]] and 38 Special/357 Magnum, are also common [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed weapons]] in jurisdictions allowing this practice because their simple mechanics make them smaller than many autoloaders while remaining reliable. Both designs are common among civilian gun owners, depending on the owner's intention (self-defense, hunting, target shooting, competitions, collecting, etc.).\n\n====Long guns====\n{{main|Long gun}}\nA long gun is generally any firearm that is larger than a handgun and is designed to be held and fired with both hands, either from the hip or the shoulder. Long guns typically have a barrel between 10 and 30 inches (there are restrictions on minimum barrel length in many jurisdictions; maximum barrel length is usually a matter of practicality), that along with the receiver and trigger group is mounted into a wood, plastic, metal or composite ''stock'', composed of one or more pieces that form a foregrip, rear grip, and optionally (but typically) a shoulder mount called the ''butt''. Early long arms, from the Renaissance up to the mid-19th century, were generally smoothbore firearms that fired one or more ball shot, called [[musket]]s or [[arquebus]] depending on caliber and firing mechanism.\n\n=====Rifles and shotguns=====\n{{main|Rifle|Shotgun}}\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903.jpg|thumb|right|Springfield Armory [[M1903 Springfield|M1903 rifle]]]]\nMost modern [[long gun]]s are either [[rifle]]s or [[shotgun]]s. Both are the successors of the musket, diverging from their parent weapon in distinct ways. A rifle is so named for the spiral fluting ([[rifling]]) machined into the inner surface of its barrel, which imparts a self-stabilizing spin to the single [[bullet]]s it fires. Shotguns are predominantly [[smoothbore]] firearms designed to fire a number of ''[[Shot (pellet)|shot]]''; pellet sizes commonly ranging between 2&nbsp;mm #9 birdshot and 8.4&nbsp;mm #00 (double-aught) buckshot. Shotguns are also capable of firing single [[shotgun slug|slugs]], or specialty (often \"[[Non-lethal weapon|less lethal]]\") rounds such as [[Bean bag round|bean bags]], tear gas or [[breaching round]]s. Rifles have a very small impact area but a long range and high accuracy. Shotguns have a large impact area with considerably less range and accuracy. However, the larger impact area can compensate for reduced accuracy, since [[Shotgun shell#Spread|shot spreads]] during flight; consequently, in hunting, shotguns are generally used for flying game.\n\nRifles and shotguns are commonly used for hunting and often to defend a home or place of business. Usually, large game are hunted with rifles (although shotguns can be used, particularly with slugs), while birds are hunted with shotguns. Shotguns are sometimes preferred for defending a home or business due to their wide impact area, multiple wound tracks (when using buckshot), shorter range, and reduced penetration of walls (when using lighter shot), which significantly reduces the likelihood of unintended harm, although the handgun is also common.\n\nThere are a variety of types of rifles and shotguns based on the method they are reloaded. Bolt-action and lever-action rifles are manually operated. Manipulation of the bolt or the lever causes the spent cartridge to be removed, the firing mechanism recocked, and a fresh cartridge inserted. These two types of action are almost exclusively used by rifles. Slide-action (commonly called 'pump-action') rifles and shotguns are manually cycled by shuttling the foregrip of the firearm back and forth. This type of action is typically used by shotguns, but several major manufacturers make rifles that use this action.\n\nBoth rifles and shotguns also come in break-action varieties that do not have any kind of reloading mechanism at all but must be hand-loaded after each shot. Both rifles and shotguns come in single- and double-barreled varieties; however due to the expense and difficulty of manufacturing, double-barreled rifles are rare. Double-barreled rifles are typically intended for African big-game hunts where the animals are dangerous, ranges are short, and speed is of the essence. Very large and powerful calibers are normal for these firearms.\n\nRifles have been in nationally featured marksmanship events in Europe and the United States since at least the 18th century, when rifles were first becoming widely available. One of the earliest purely \"American\" rifle-shooting competitions took place in 1775, when Daniel Morgan was recruiting sharpshooters in Virginia for the impending [[American Revolutionary War]]. In some countries, rifle marksmanship is still a matter of national pride. Some specialized rifles in the larger calibers are claimed to have an accurate range of up to about {{convert|1|mi|m}}, although most have considerably less. In the second half of the 20th century, competitive shotgun sports became perhaps even more popular than riflery, largely due to the motion and immediate feedback in activities such as skeet, trap and sporting clays.\n\nIn military use, bolt-action rifles with high-power scopes are common as sniper rifles, however by the [[Korean War]] the traditional bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles used by infantrymen had been supplemented by select-fire designs known as \"automatic rifles\".\n\n=====Carbines=====\n{{main|Carbine}}\nA carbine is a firearm similar to a rifle in form and intended usage, but generally shorter or smaller than the typical \"full-size\" hunting or battle rifle of a similar time period, and sometimes using a smaller or less-powerful cartridge. Carbines were and are typically used by members of the military in roles that are expected to engage in combat, but where a full-size rifle would be an impediment to the primary duties of that soldier (vehicle drivers, field commanders and support staff, airborne troops, engineers, etc.). Carbines are also common in law enforcement and among civilian owners where similar size, space and/or power concerns may exist. Carbines, like rifles, can be single-shot, repeating-action, semi-automatic or select-fire/fully automatic, generally depending on the time period and intended market. Common historical examples include the [[Winchester Model 1892]], Lee\u2013Enfield \"[[Jungle Carbine]]\", [[SKS]], [[M1 carbine]] (no relation to the larger [[M1 Garand]]) and [[M4 carbine]] (a more compact variant of the current [[M16 rifle]]). Modern U.S. civilian carbines include compact customizations of the [[AR-15]], [[Ruger Mini-14]], [[Beretta Cx4 Storm]], [[Kel-Tec SUB-2000]], bolt-action rifles generally falling under the specifications of a [[scout rifle]], and aftermarket conversion kits for popular pistols including the [[M1911 pistol|M1911]] and [[Glock]] models.\n\n=====Machine guns=====\n{{main|Machine gun}}\n\n[[File:MG42 Sideview.jpg|thumb|[[MG 42]] general-purpose machine gun with retracted bipod]]\n\nA machine gun is a fully automatic emplaceable weapon, most often separated from other classes of automatic weapon by the use of belt-fed ammunition (though some designs employ drum, pan or hopper magazines), generally in a rifle-inspired caliber ranging between [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] (.223 Remington) for a [[light machine gun]] to as large as [[.50 BMG]] or even larger for crewed or aircraft weapons. Although not widely fielded until World War I, early machine guns were being used by militaries in the second half of the 19th century. Notables in the U.S. arsenal during the 20th century included the [[M2 Browning]] .50 caliber heavy machine gun and [[M1919 Browning machine gun|M1919 Browning]] .30 caliber medium machine gun, and the [[M60 machine gun|M60]] [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] general-purpose machine gun which came into use around the Vietnam War. Machine guns of this type were originally defensive firearms crewed by at least two men, mainly because of the difficulties involved in moving and placing them, their ammunition, and their tripod. In contrast, modern [[light machine gun]]s such as the [[FN Minimi]] are often wielded by a single infantryman. They provide a large ammunition capacity and a high rate of fire, and are typically used to give suppressing fire during infantry movement. Accuracy on machine guns varies based on a wide number of factors from design to manufacturing tolerances, most of which have been improved over time. Machine guns are often mounted on vehicles or helicopters, and have been used since World War I as offensive firearms in fighter aircraft and tanks (e.g. for air combat or suppressing fire for ground troop support).\n\nThe definition of machine gun is different in U.S. law. The [[National Firearms Act]] and [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] define a \"machine gun\" in the United States code ''Title 26, Subtitle E, Chapter 53, Subchapter B, Part 1, \u00a7 5845'' as:\n\"... any firearm which shoots ... automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger\". \"Machine gun\" is therefore largely synonymous with \"automatic weapon\" in the U.S. civilian parlance, covering all automatic firearms.\n\n=====Submachine guns=====\n{{main|Submachine gun}}\n[[File:Normal skorpion 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Czechoslovak 7.65 mm [[submachine gun]] [[\u0160korpion vz. 61]] designed in 1959.]]\nA submachine gun is a magazine-fed firearm, usually smaller than other automatic firearms, that fires [[pistol]]-caliber ammunition; for this reason certain submachine guns can also be referred to as ''machine pistols'', especially when referring to handgun-sized designs such as the [[\u0160korpion vz. 61]] and [[Glock#9\u00d719mm Parabellum|Glock 18]]. Well-known examples are the Israeli [[Uzi]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] which use the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] cartridge, and the American [[Thompson submachine gun]] which fires [[.45 ACP]]. Because of their small size and limited projectile penetration compared to high-power rifle rounds, submachine guns are commonly favored by military, paramilitary and police forces for close-quarters engagements such as inside buildings, in urban areas or in trench complexes.\n\nSubmachine guns were originally about the size of carbines. Because they fire pistol ammunition, they have limited long-range use, but in close combat can be used in fully automatic in a controllable manner due to the lighter recoil of the pistol ammunition. They are also extremely inexpensive and simple to build in time of war, enabling a nation to quickly arm its military. In the latter half of the 20th century, submachine guns were being miniaturized to the point of being only slightly larger than some large handguns. The most widely used submachine gun at the end of the 20th century was the Heckler & Koch MP5. The MP5 is actually designated as a \"machine pistol\" by Heckler & Koch (MP5 stands for ''Maschinenpistole 5'', or Machine Pistol 5), although some reserve this designation for even smaller submachine guns such as the MAC-10 and [[Glock#9\u00d719mm Parabellum|Glock 18]], which are about the size and shape of pistols.\n\n=====Automatic rifles=====\n{{main|Automatic rifle}}\nAn automatic rifle is a magazine-fed firearm, wielded by a single infantryman, that is chambered for rifle cartridges and capable of automatic fire. The [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]] was the first U.S. infantry weapon of this type, and was generally used for suppressive or support fire in the role now usually filled by the [[light machine gun]]. Other early automatic rifles include the [[Fedorov Avtomat]] and the [[Huot Automatic Rifle]]. Later, German forces fielded the [[StG 44|Sturmgewehr 44]] during [[World War II]], a light automatic rifle firing a reduced power \"[[intermediate cartridge]]\". This design was to become the basis for the \"[[assault rifle]]\" subclass of automatic weapons, as contrasted with \"[[battle rifle]]s\", which generally fire a traditional \"full-power\" rifle cartridge.\n\n=====Assault rifles=====\n{{main|Assault rifle}}\n[[File:Marine AK-47.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Marine]]s train with the AK-47.]]\nIn [[World War II]], Germany introduced the [[StG 44]], and brought to the forefront of firearm technology what eventually became the class of firearm most widely adopted by the military, the assault rifle. An assault rifle is usually slightly smaller than a [[battle rifle]] such as the [[Karabiner 98k]], but the chief differences defining an assault rifle are [[Selective_fire|select-fire capability]] and the use of a rifle round of lesser power, known as an [[intermediate cartridge]].   \n\nSoviet engineer [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] quickly adapted the German concept, using a less-powerful 7.62\u00d739mm cartridge derived from the standard 7.62\u00d754mmR Russian battle rifle round, to produce the [[AK-47]], which has become the world's most widely used assault rifle. Soon after World War II, the Automatic Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle began to be fielded by the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies in the Eastern Bloc, as well as by nations such as China, North Korea, and North Vietnam.\n\nIn the United States, the assault rifle design was later in coming; the replacement for the M1 Garand of WWII was another John Garand design chambered for the new [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] cartridge; the select-fire [[M14 rifle|M14]], which was used by the U.S. military until the 1960s. The significant recoil of the M14 when fired in full-automatic mode was seen as a problem as it reduced accuracy, and in the 1960s it was replaced by [[Eugene Stoner]]'s [[AR-15]], which also marked a switch from the powerful .30 caliber cartridges used by the U.S. military up until early in the Vietnam War to the much less powerful but far lighter and light recoiling .223 caliber (5.56mm) [[intermediate cartridge]]. The military later designated the AR-15 as the \"[[M16 rifle|M16]]\". The civilian version of the M16 continues to be known as the AR-15 and looks exactly like the military version, although to conform to [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|B.A.T.F.E.]] regulations in the U.S., it lacks the mechanism that permits fully automatic fire.\n\nVariants of both of the M16 and AK-47 are still in wide international use today, though other automatic rifle designs have since been introduced. A smaller version of the M16A2, the [[M4 carbine]], is widely used by U.S. and NATO tank and vehicle crews, airbornes, support staff, and in other scenarios where space is limited. The [[IMI Galil]], an Israeli-designed weapon based on the action of the AK-47, is in use by Israel, Italy, Burma, the Philippines, Peru, and Colombia. [[Swiss Arms]] of Switzerland produces the [[SIG SG 550]] assault rifle used by France, Chile, and Spain among others, and [[Steyr Mannlicher]] produces the [[Steyr AUG|AUG]], a [[bullpup]] rifle in use in Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Saudi Arabia among other nations.\n\nModern designs call for compact weapons retaining firepower. The bullpup design, by mounting the magazine behind the trigger, unifies the accuracy and firepower of the traditional assault rifle with the compact size of the submachine gun (though submachine guns are still used); examples are the French [[FAMAS]] and the British [[SA80]].\n\n=====Personal defense weapons=====\n{{main|Personal defense weapon}}\nA recently developed class of firearm is the [[personal defense weapon]] or PDW, which is in simplest terms a [[submachine gun]] designed to fire ammunitions with ballistic performance similar to rifle cartridges.  While a submachine gun is desirable for its compact size and ammunition capacity, its pistol cartridges lack the penetrating capability of a rifle round.  Conversely, rifle bullets can pierce light armor and are easier to shoot accurately, but even a [[carbine]] such as the Colt M4 is larger and/or longer than a submachine gun, making it harder to maneuver in close quarters.  The solution many firearms manufacturers have presented is a weapon resembling a submachine gun in size and general configuration, but which fires a higher-powered armor-penetrating round (often specially designed for the weapon), thus combining the advantages of a carbine and submachine gun.  This also earned the PDWs an infrequently used nickname \u2014 the submachine carbines.  The [[FN P90]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP7]] are most famous examples of PDWs.\n\n===Function===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Firearm action}}\nFirearms are also categorized by their functioning cycle or \"action\" which describes its loading, firing, and unloading cycle.\n\n====Manual====\nThe earliest evolution of the firearm, there are many types of manual action firearms. These can be divided into two basic categories: [[single shot]] and [[Repeating rifle|repeating]].\n\nA single shot firearm can only be fired once per equipped barrel before it must be reloaded or charged via an external mechanism or series of steps. A repeating firearm can be fired multiple times, but can only be fired once with each subsequent pull of the trigger. Between trigger pulls, the firearm's action must be reloaded or charged via an internal mechanism.\n\n====Semi-automatic====\n{{main|Semi-automatic firearm}}\nA semi-automatic, self-loading, or \"auto loader\" firearm is one that performs all steps necessary to prepare it for firing again after a single discharge, until cartridges are no longer available in the weapon's feed device or magazine. Auto loaders fire one shot with each pull of the trigger. Some people confuse the term with \"fully automatic\" firearms.  (See next.) While some semi-automatic rifles may resemble military-style firearms, they are not properly classified \"Assault Weapons\" which refers to those that continue to fire until the finger no longer depressed the trigger.\n\n====Automatic====\nAn ''automatic'' firearm, or \"fully automatic\", \"fully auto\", or \"full auto\", is generally defined as one that continues to load and fire cartridges from its magazine as long as the trigger is depressed (and until the magazine is depleted of available ammunition. The first weapon generally considered in this category is the [[Gatling gun]], originally a carriage-mounted, crank-operated firearm with multiple rotating barrels that was fielded in the [[American Civil War]]. The modern trigger-actuated machine gun began with various designs developed in the late 19th century and fielded in [[World War I]], such as the [[Maxim gun]], [[Lewis Gun]], and [[MG 08|MG 08 \"Spandau\"]]. Most automatic weapons are classed as long guns (as the ammunition used is of similar type as for rifles, and the recoil of the weapon's rapid fire is better controlled with two hands), but handgun-sized automatic weapons also exist, generally in the \"submachine gun\" or \"machine pistol\" class.\n\n====Selective fire====\n{{main|Selective fire}}\n'''Selective fire''', or \"select fire\", means the capability of a weapon's fire control to be adjusted in either semi-automatic or fully automatic firing modes.  The modes are chosen by means of a selector, which varies depending on the weapon's design.  Some selective-fire weapons have [[burst mode (weapons)|burst fire]] mechanisms built in to limit the maximum number of shots fired in fully automatic mode, with most common limits being two or three rounds per trigger pull.  The presence of selective-fire modes on firearms allows more efficient use of ammunition for specific tactical needs, either precision-aimed or [[suppressive fire]].  This capability is most commonly found on military weapons of the 20th and 21st centuries, most notably the [[assault rifle]]s.\n\n==Health hazards==\n{{See also|Gunshot wound|Gun safety}}\nAssault by firearm resulted in 173,000 deaths, globally, in 2015, up from 128,000 deaths in 1990.<ref name=GBD2015>{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Haidong|last2=Naghavi|first2=MohsenA|title=Global, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes of death, 1980\u20132015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015|journal=The Lancet|date=October 2016|volume=388|issue=10053|pages=1459\u20131544|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31012-1}}</ref><ref name=GDB2013>{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2}}</ref> Additionally, there were 32,000 unintentional firearm global deaths in 2015.<ref name=GBD2015/> In 2017, there were 15,613 deaths caused by firearms in the US.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls|title=Past Summary Ledgers {{!}} Gun Violence Archive|website=www.gunviolencearchive.org|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref> Additionally, there were 61,599 firearms related incidents in the US in 2017.<ref name=\":0\" /> Over 50% of suicides in the United States are firearm suicides.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Matthew |last=Lang |title=Firearm background checks and suicide |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=123 |pages=1085\u20131099 |year=2013 |doi=10.1111/ecoj.12007 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/55d0/b6af2ed807dbd872cd7c9e40145db92c86a4.pdf}}</ref> More than 60% of firearms deaths in the United States are suicide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gun Deaths Are Mostly Suicides |authorlink=Margot Sanger-Katz |first=Margot |last=Sanger-Katz |date=October 8, 2015 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 28, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/upshot/gun-deaths-are-mostly-suicides.html |quote=More than 60 percent of people in this country who die from guns die by suicide.}}</ref> Firearms are the second leading mechanism of injury deaths, after motor vehicle accidents.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[National Vital Statistics System]] |publisher=[[National Center for Health Statistics]] |date=June 2, 2004 |volume=52 |number=21 |pages=1-86 |title=Deaths: injuries, 2001 |last1=Anderson |first1=RN |last2=Mini\u00f1o |first2=AM |last3=Fingerhut |first3=LA |last4=Warner |first4=M |last5=Heinen |first5=MA |pmid=15222463}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[National Vital Statistics System]] |publisher=[[National Center for Health Statistics]] |date=January 31, 2006 |volume=54 |number=10 |pages=1-124 |title=Deaths: injuries, 2002 |last2=Anderson |first2=RN |last1=Mini\u00f1o |first1=AM |last3=Fingerhut |first3=LA |last5=Warner |first5=M |last4=Boudreault |first4=MA |pmid=16485447}}</ref> To prevent unintentional injury, gun safety training includes education on proper firearm storage and firearm-handling etiquette.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=United States Government Accountability Office|title=Personal Firearms Programs that Promote Safe Storage and Research on Their Effectiveness|date=September 2017|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/687239.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aero Precision|title=Gun Safety and Instruction Manual|url=https://aeroprecisionusa.com/media/file_mgr/Aero-Precision-Gun-Safety-and-Instruction-Manual.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Heilongjianghandcannon.jpg|thumb|The [[Heilongjiang hand cannon]], dated to 1288, is a [[Yuan Dynasty]] hand cannon, and currently the world's oldest surviving firearm.

The Turks, Iranians, (first Aq Qoyunlu and Safavids), and Indians (first Mughals) all got them no later than the 15th century. In each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans. The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.<ref name=Chase />{{rp|31\u201332}}\n\nThe development behind firearms accelerated during the 19th and 20th centuries. Breech-loading became more or less a universal standard for the reloading of most hand-held firearms and continues to be so with some notable exceptions (such as mortars). Instead of loading individual rounds into weapons, magazines holding multiple munitions were adopted&mdash;these aided rapid reloading. Automatic and semi-automatic firing mechanisms meant that a single soldier could fire many more rounds in a minute than a vintage weapon could fire over the course of a battle. Polymers and alloys in firearm construction made weaponry progressively lighter and thus easier to deploy. Ammunition changed over the centuries from simple metallic ball-shaped projectiles that rattled down the barrel to bullets and cartridges manufactured to high precision. Especially in the past century has particular attention been devoted to accuracy and sighting to make firearms altogether far more accurate than ever before. More than any single factor though, firearms have proliferated due to the advent of mass production&mdash;enabling arms manufacturers to produce large quantities of weaponry to a consistent standard.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe force of a projectile is related to the kinetic energy imparted to it, given by the formula <math>E_\\text{k} =\\tfrac{1}{2} mv^2 </math> where <math>m</math> is the mass and <math>v</math> is the velocity of the projectile.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nGenerally, kinetic energy can be enhanced in two ways:\n\n* By increasing the mass of the bullet, either by increasing caliber (and thus size and weight), or by using denser materials like uranium or tungsten.\n* By increasing the projectile's velocity, through better or larger propellant charges, through better manufacturing tolerances and materials in bullet and barrel, or through longer barrels.\n\nVelocities of bullets increased with the use of a \"jacket\" of a metal such as copper or copper alloys that covered a lead core and allowed the bullet to glide down the barrel more easily than exposed lead. Such bullets are designated as \"full metal jacket\" (FMJ). Such FMJ bullets are less likely to fragment on impact and are more likely to traverse through a target while imparting less energy. Hence, FMJ bullets impart less tissue damage than non-jacketed bullets that expand. (Dougherty and Eidt, 2009) This led to their adoption for military use by countries adhering to the Hague Convention in 1899.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThat said, the basic principle behind firearm operation remains unchanged to this day. A musket of several centuries ago is still similar in principle to a modern-day assault rifle&mdash;using the expansion of gases to propel projectiles over long distances&mdash;albeit less accurately and rapidly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://allthingsliberty.com/2013/07/the-inaccuracy-of-muskets/|title=The Inaccuracy of Muskets - Journal of the American Revolution|date=2013-07-15|work=Journal of the American Revolution|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution===\n====Early models====\n=====Fire lances=====\n{{main|Fire lance}}\nThe Chinese [[fire lance]]{{when|date=August 2018}} was the direct predecessor to the modern concept of the firearm. It was not a gun itself, but an addition to the soldiers' spears. Originally it consisted of paper or bamboo barrels that would have incendiary gunpowder within it, that could be lit one time and would project flames at the enemy. Sometimes the Chinese troops would place small projectiles within the barrel that would also be projected when the gunpowder was lit, but most of the explosive force would create flames. Later, the barrel was changed to be made of metal, so that a more explosive gunpowder could be used and put more force into the propulsion of the projectile.<ref name=Chase />{{rp|31\u201332}}\n\n=====Hand cannons=====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Hand cannon}}\n[[File:Lgehumble 1400.jpg|thumb|[[Hand cannon]] being fired from a stand, \"Belli Fortis\", manuscript, by Konrad Kyeser, 1400]]\nThe original predecessor of all firearms, the Chinese [[fire lance]]{{when|date=August 2018}} and [[hand cannon]] were loaded with gunpowder and the shot (initially [[lead shot]], later replaced by cast iron{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}) through the muzzle, while a fuse was placed at the rear. This fuse was lit, causing the gunpowder to ignite and propel the cannonball. In military use, the standard hand cannon was tremendously powerful, while also being somewhat useless{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} due to relative inability of the gunner to aim the weapon, or control the ballistic properties of the projectile. Recoil could be absorbed by bracing the barrel against the ground using a wooden support, the forerunner of the [[Stock (firearms)|stock]]. Neither the quality or amount of gunpowder, nor the consistency in projectile dimensions were controlled, with resulting inaccuracy in firing due to [[windage]], variance in gunpowder composition, and the difference in diameter between the [[Caliber|bore]] and the shot. The [[hand cannon]]s were replaced by lighter carriage-mounted [[artillery]] pieces, and ultimately the [[arquebus]].\n\n=====Muskets=====\n{{main|Musket}}\n[[Muzzleloader|Muzzle-loading]] muskets (smooth-bored long guns) were among the first firearms developed.{{when|date=August 2018}} The firearm was loaded through the muzzle with gunpowder, optionally some wadding and then a bullet (usually a solid lead ball, but musketeers could shoot stones when they ran out of bullets). Greatly improved muzzleloaders (usually rifled instead of smooth-bored) are manufactured today and have many enthusiasts, many of whom hunt large and small game with their guns. Muzzleloaders have to be manually reloaded after each shot; a skilled archer could fire multiple arrows faster than most early muskets could be reloaded and fired, although by the mid-18th century, when muzzleloaders became the standard small armament of the military, a well-drilled soldier could fire six rounds in a minute using prepared cartridges in his musket. Before then, effectiveness of muzzleloaders was hindered by both the low reloading speed and, before the firing mechanism was perfected, the very high risk posed by the firearm to the person attempting to fire it.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nOne interesting solution to the reloading problem was the \"Roman Candle Gun\" with [[superposed load]]s. This was a muzzleloader in which multiple charges and balls were loaded one on top of the other, with a small hole in each ball to allow the subsequent charge to be ignited after the one ahead of it was ignited. It was neither a very reliable nor popular firearm, but it enabled a form of \"automatic\" fire long before the advent of the machine gun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotwars.com/html/equip_firearms2.htm#3|title=Roman Candle Gun|work=Scotwars.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302211812/http://scotwars.com/html/equip_firearms2.htm|archivedate=March 2, 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Loading techniques====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Muzzleloader}}\n[[File:Meyers b8 s0102a.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Percussion cap]] and early [[bolt action]] form]]\nMost early firearms were muzzle-loading. This form of loading has several disadvantages, such as a slow rate of fire and having to expose oneself to enemy fire to reload as the weapon had to be pointed upright so the powder could be poured through the muzzle into the breech followed by the ramming the projectile into the breech. As effective methods of sealing the breech were developed through the development of sturdy, weatherproof, self-contained metallic cartridges, muzzle-loaders were replaced by single-shot breech loaders. Eventually single-shot weapons were replaced by the following repeater type weapons.\n\n====Internal magazines====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Magazine (firearms)}}\nMany firearms made in the late 19th century through the 1950s used internal magazines to load the cartridge into the chamber of the weapon. The most notable and revolutionary weapons of this period appeared during the U.S. Civil War and they were the [[Spencer rifle|Spencer]] and [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifles. Both used fixed tubular magazines, the former having the magazine in the buttstock and the latter under the barrel which allowed a larger capacity. Later weapons used fixed box magazines that could not be removed from the weapon without dissembling the weapon itself. Fixed magazines permitted the use of larger cartridges and eliminated the hazard of having the bullet of one cartridge butting next to the primer or rim of another cartridge. These magazines are loaded while they are in the weapon, often using a stripper clip. A clip is used to transfer cartridges into the magazine. Some notable weapons that use internal magazines include the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]], the [[Mauser Kar 98k]], the [[Springfield M1903]], the [[M1 Garand]], and the [[SKS]]. Firearms that have internal magazines are usually, but not always, rifles. Some exceptions to this include the Mauser C96 pistol, which uses an internal magazine, and the [[Breda 30]], an Italian light machine gun.\n\n====Detachable magazines====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nMany modern firearms use what are called detachable or box magazines as their method of chambering a cartridge. Detachable magazines can be removed from the weapon without disassembling the firearms, usually by pushing the magazine release.\n\n====Belt-fed weapons====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Belt (firearm)}}\nA belt or ammunition belt is a device used to retain and feed cartridges into a firearm commonly used on machine guns. Belts were originally composed of canvas or cloth with pockets spaced evenly to allow the belt to be mechanically fed into the gun. These designs were prone to malfunctions due to the effects of oil and other contaminants altering the belt. Later belt designs used permanently connected metal links to retain the cartridges during feeding. These belts were more tolerant to exposure to solvents and oil. Some notable weapons that use belts are the M240, the M249, the M134 Minigun, and the PK Machine Gun.\n\n====Firing mechanisms====\n{{further|Trigger (firearms)|Firearm action}}\n\n=====Matchlock=====\n{{main|Matchlock}}\n[[Matchlock]]s were the first and simplest firearms firing mechanisms developed. Using the matchlock mechanism, the powder in the gun barrel was ignited by a piece of burning cord called a \"match\". The match was wedged into one end of an S-shaped piece of steel. As the trigger (often actually a lever) was pulled, the match was brought into the open end of a \"touch hole\" at the base of the gun barrel, which contained a very small quantity of gunpowder, igniting the main charge of gunpowder in the gun barrel. The match usually had to be relit after each firing. The main parts to the matchlock firing mechanism are the pan, match, arm and trigger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/move/musket |title=> Where Are You From? |publisher=Credo Reference |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> A benefit of the pan and arm swivel being moved to the side of the gun was it gave a clear line of fire.<ref>Weir, William. 50 Weapons That Changed Warfare. Franklin Lakes, NJ: New Page, 2005. 71\u201374. Print.</ref> An advantage to the matchlock firing mechanism is that it did not misfire. However, it also came with some disadvantages. One disadvantage was if it was raining the match could not be kept lit to fire the weapon.  Another issue with the match was it could give away the position of soldiers because of the glow, sound, and smell.<ref>Saidel, Benjamin. \"Matchlocks, Flintlocks, and Saltpetre: The Chronological Implications for the Use of Matchlock Muskets among Ottoman-Period Bedouin in the Southern Levant.\" ''International Journal of Historical Archaeology'' 4 (2000): 191\u2013215.</ref>\n\n=====Wheellock=====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Wheellock}}\nThe [[wheellock]] action, a successor to the matchlock, predated the flintlock. Despite its many faults, the wheellock was a significant improvement over the matchlock in terms of both convenience and safety, since it eliminated the need to keep a smoldering match in proximity to loose gunpowder. It operated using a small wheel much like that on [[Lighter|cigarette lighters]] which was wound up with a key before use and which, when the trigger was pulled, spun against a flint, creating the shower of sparks that ignited the powder in the touch hole. Supposedly invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], the Italian [[Polymath|Renaissance man]], the wheellock action was an innovation that was not widely adopted due to the high cost of the clockwork mechanism.\n\n=====Flintlock=====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Flintlock}}\nThe [[flintlock]] action was a major innovation in firearm design. The spark used to ignite the gunpowder in the touch hole was supplied by a sharpened piece of flint clamped in the jaws of a \"cock\" which, when released by the trigger, struck a piece of steel called the \"[[frizzen]]\" to create the necessary sparks. (The spring-loaded arm that holds a piece of flint or pyrite is referred to as a cock because of its resemblance to a rooster.) The cock had to be manually reset after each firing, and the flint had to be replaced periodically due to wear from striking the frizzen. (See also [[flintlock mechanism]], [[snaphance]], [[Miquelet lock]]) The flintlock was widely used during the 18th and 19th centuries in both muskets and rifles.\n[[File:Cody Firearms Museum.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Antique firearm display in the main entrance to the [[Cody Firearms Museum]].]]\n\n=====Percussion cap=====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{further|Percussion cap|Caplock mechanism}}\n[[Percussion cap]]s ([[caplock mechanism]]s), coming into wide service in the 19th century, were a dramatic improvement over flintlocks. With the percussion cap mechanism, the small primer charge of gunpowder used in all preceding firearms was replaced by a completely self-contained explosive charge contained in a small brass \"cap\". The cap was fastened to the touch hole of the gun (extended to form a \"nipple\") and ignited by the impact of the gun's \"hammer\". (The hammer is roughly the same as the cock found on flintlocks except that it doesn't clamp onto anything.) In the case of percussion caps the hammer was hollow on the end to fit around the cap in order to keep the cap from fragmenting and injuring the shooter.\n\nOnce struck, the flame from the cap in turn ignited the main charge of gunpowder, as with the flintlock, but there was no longer any need to charge the touch hole with gunpowder, and even better, the touch hole was no longer exposed to the elements. As a result, the percussion cap mechanism was considerably safer, far more weatherproof, and vastly more reliable (cloth-bound cartridges containing a premeasured charge of gunpowder and a ball had been in regular military service for many years, but the exposed gunpowder in the entry to the touch hole had long been a source of misfires). All [[muzzleloader]]s manufactured since the second half of the 19th century use percussion caps except those built as replicas of the flintlock or earlier firearms.\n\n====Cartridges====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Cartridge (firearms)}}\n{{further|Magazine (firearms)|Ammunition}}\nA major innovation in firearms and light artillery came in the second half of the 19th century when ammunition, previously delivered as separate bullets and powder, was combined in a single metallic (usually brass) [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] containing a percussion cap, powder, and a bullet in one weatherproof package. The main technical advantage of the brass cartridge case was the effective and reliable sealing of high pressure gasses at the breech, as the gas pressure forces the cartridge case to expand outward, pressing it firmly against the inside of the gun barrel chamber.  This prevents the leakage of hot gas which could injure the shooter. The brass cartridge also opened the way for modern repeating arms, by uniting the bullet, gunpowder and primer into one assembly that could be fed reliably into the breech by a mechanical action in the firearm.\n\nBefore this, a \"cartridge\" was simply a premeasured quantity of [[gunpowder]] together with a ball in a small cloth bag (or rolled paper cylinder), which also acted as [[wadding]] for the charge and ball. This early form of cartridge had to be rammed into the muzzleloader's barrel, and either a small charge of gunpowder in the touch hole or an external percussion cap mounted on the touch hole ignited the gunpowder in the cartridge. Cartridges with built-in percussion caps (called \"primers\") continue to this day to be the standard in firearms. In cartridge-firing firearms, a hammer (or a firing pin struck by the hammer) strikes the cartridge primer, which then ignites the gunpowder within. The primer charge is at the base of the cartridge, either within the rim (a \"[[rimfire ammunition|rimfire]]\" cartridge) or in a small percussion cap embedded in the center of the base (a \"[[centerfire]]\" cartridge). As a rule, centerfire cartridges are more powerful than rimfire cartridges, operating at considerably higher pressures than rimfire cartridges. Centerfire cartridges are also safer, as a dropped rimfire cartridge has the potential to discharge if its rim strikes the ground with sufficient force to ignite the primer. This is practically impossible with most centerfire cartridges.\n\nNearly all contemporary firearms load cartridges directly into their [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]]. Some additionally or exclusively load from a [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] that holds multiple cartridges. A magazine is defined as a part of the firearm which exists to store ammunition and assist in its feeding by the action into the breech (such as through the rotation of a revolver's cylinder or by spring-loaded platforms in most pistol and rifle designs). Some magazines, such as that of most centerfire hunting rifles and all revolvers, are internal to and inseparable from the firearm, and are loaded by using a \"clip\".  A [[clip (ammunition)|clip]], often mistakingly used to refer to a detachable \"magazine\", is a device that holds the ammunition by the rim of the case and is designed to assist the shooter in reloading the firearm's magazine. Examples include revolver [[speedloader]]s, the [[stripper clip]] used to aid loading rifles such as the [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] or [[Mauser 98]], and the [[En-bloc clip#En bloc|en-bloc clip]] used in loading the [[M1 Garand]]. In this sense, \"magazines\" and \"clips\", though often used synonymously, refer to different types of devices.\n\n====Repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{further|Single-shot}}\n{{main|Repeating rifle}}\n{{main|Semi-automatic firearm}}\n[[File:FAMAS dsc06877.jpg|thumb|The French [[FAMAS]], example of a [[bullpup]] rifle]]\n[[File:M4w-att.jpg|thumb|The [[M4 carbine]], a modern-day service rifle capable of being fired automatically. It is in service by the U.S. Military and has a wide ability for customization.]]\nMany firearms are \"single shot\": i.e., each time a cartridge is fired, the operator must manually re-cock the firearm and load another cartridge. The classic single-barreled shotgun is a good example. A firearm that can load multiple cartridges as the firearm is re-cocked is considered a \"repeating firearm\" or simply a \"repeater\". A lever-action rifle, a pump-action shotgun, and most bolt-action rifles are good examples of repeating firearms. A firearm that automatically re-cocks and reloads the next round with each trigger pull is considered a semi-automatic or autoloading firearm.\n\nThe first \"rapid firing\" firearms were usually similar to the 19th century [[Gatling gun]], which would fire cartridges from a magazine as fast as and as long as the operator turned a crank. Eventually, the \"rapid\" firing mechanism was perfected and miniaturized to the extent that either the recoil of the firearm or the gas pressure from firing could be used to operate it, thus the operator needed only to pull a trigger (which made the firing mechanisms truly \"automatic\"). An [[automatic (firearm)|automatic]] (or \"fully automatic\") firearm is one that automatically re-cocks, reloads, and fires as long as the trigger is depressed. An automatic firearm is capable of firing multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. The [[Gatling gun]] may have been the first automatic weapon, though the modern trigger-actuated machine gun was not widely introduced until the [[World War I|First World War]] with the German \"[[MG 08|Spandau]]\" and British [[Lewis Gun]]. Automatic rifles such as the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]] were in common use by the military during the early part of the 20th century, and automatic rifles that fired handgun rounds, known as submachine guns, also appeared in this time. Many modern military firearms have a [[selective fire]] option, which is a mechanical switch that allows the firearm be fired either in the semi-automatic or fully automatic mode. In the current M16A2 and M16A4 variants of the U.S.-made [[M16 rifle|M16]], continuous fully automatic fire is not possible, having been replaced by an automatic burst of three cartridges (this conserves ammunition and increases controllability).

In the [[American Revolutionary War]],  General Washington led [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] forces to victory over the British and their allies. He presided at the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787, which established the new federal government, and he has been called the \"[[Father of the Nation|Father of His Country]]\".\n\nWashington was born to a moderately prosperous family of planters and slaveholders in [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]]. He had early educational opportunities, learned mathematics, and soon launched a successful career as a surveyor which enabled him to make significant land investments. He then became a key leader of the Virginia militia in the [[French and Indian War]]. He was appointed [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Continental Army]] during the Revolutionary War, leading an allied campaign to victory at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] which ended the conflict. Once victory was in hand, in 1783 he resigned as commander-in-chief, declining further authority and power out of his devotion to [[republicanism in the United States|republicanism]].\n\nAs the country's premier statesman, Washington was unanimously elected President by the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] in the first two national elections. He promoted and oversaw implementation of a strong, well-financed national government, using the economic plans of his Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]], while remaining impartial in the fierce rivalry between Hamilton and  Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]]. When the [[French Revolution]] plunged Europe into war, Washington proclaimed a policy of neutrality to protect American ships, while the controversial [[Jay Treaty]] of 1795 normalized trade relations with Great Britain. He set numerous precedents that have endured, such as the [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]] advisory system, the inaugural address, and the title \"Mr. President\". His seminal [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]] strongly warned against [[partisan (politics)|political partisanship]], [[sectionalism]], and involvement in foreign wars.\n\nWashington owned slaves throughout his life from age 11, but he became increasingly troubled by slavery and freed his slaves in his will. He was a member of the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]] and the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], and he urged tolerance for all religions in his roles as general and President. Upon his death, he was famously eulogized as \"first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen\". Washington has been widely memorialized by monuments, art, places, stamps, and currency, and he has been consistently [[historical rankings of presidents of the United States|ranked by scholars]] among the four greatest American presidents.\n\n== Early years (1732\u20131752) ==\n{{Further|Ancestry of George Washington|Colony of Virginia|British America}}\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of [[Augustine Washington]] and his wife [[Mary Ball Washington]], at [[Wakefield, Virginia|Wakefield]] on their [[George Washington Birthplace National Monument|Popes Creek Estate]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]].

Washington sought advice from his cabinet; Jefferson and [[Edmund Randolph|Randolph]] strongly opposed the new bank constitutionally, while Hamilton believed that it was within the authority of the government's enumerated powers.

Threats and violence against tax collectors escalated into full-scale defiance of federal authority in 1794 known as the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].

This represented the premier instance of the federal government using military force to exert authority over the states and citizens{{sfn|Kohn|1972|pp=567\u201384}} and remains the only time a sitting president has personally commanded troops in the field. Washington justified his action against \"certain self-created societies\" whom he regarded as \"subversive organizations\" that threatened the national union.

On November 4, St. Clair's forces were ambushed and overwhelmingly [[St. Clair's Defeat|defeated]] with few survivors, despite Washington's warning of surprise attacks.

The inauguration was held in the Senate Chamber of [[Congress Hall]] in Philadelphia on Monday, March 4, 1793, and the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath of office]] was administered by Associate Justice [[William Cushing]]. This was the first inauguration to take place in Philadelphia, the nation's temporary capital.

In the event that he won a third term but died before its completion, his vice president would ascend to the presidency without election, counteracting Washington's goal. (He in fact did die in 1799, two years into the new term). The election went forward and he remained neutral concerning rival candidates [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. He did not personally feel bound to a two-term limit, but in relinquishing power he again set precedent; the longstanding practice of a two-term limit to the presidency was finally made law when it was [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|amended into the Constitution in 1951]]. Washington is often credited with founding the principal of a two-term presidency; however, it was Thomas Jefferson who first refused to run for a third term on political grounds.

He was vocal in his support of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] and convinced Federalist [[John Marshall]] to run for Congress to weaken the Jeffersonian hold on Virginia.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=386}}\n\nWashington grew restless of retirement, prompted by tensions with France, and he wrote to Secretary of War [[James McHenry]] offering to organize President Adams' army.{{sfn|Randall|1997|p=497}}  French privateers began seizing American ships in 1798, and relations with France deteriorated and led to the [[Quasi-War]]. Adams offered Washington a commission as lieutenant general on July 4, 1798, and as Commander-in-chief of the armies raised for service in that conflict. He accepted and served as the Commanding General from July 13, 1798 until his death 17 months later. He participated in planning for a provisional army to meet any emergency, but he avoided involvement in details. He delegated most of the work to Hamilton, including active leadership of the army as a major general. No army invaded the United States during this period, and Washington did not assume a field command.{{efn|He was the only former President who served as a presidential appointee until 1921, when President [[Warren G.

Historians estimate that this estate was worth about $1 million in 1799 dollars, equivalent to about $19.9 million in 2014.{{sfn|Dalzell|Dalzell|1998|p=219}}\n\n==Final days==\n[[File:Life of George Washington, Deathbed.jpg|left|thumb|''Washington on his Deathbed''<br>[[Junius Brutus Stearns]] 1799]]\n\nOn Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington inspected his farms by horse while snow and sleet were falling. He returned late for dinner, his neck was wet, and snow matted his hair. He refused to change his wet clothes, not wanting to keep his guests waiting. He had a sore throat the following day but again went out in freezing, snowy weather to mark trees for cutting. That evening, he complained of a sore throat and chest congestion, but he remained cheerful. Early Saturday morning, he awoke to an inflamed throat and difficulty breathing. He ordered estate overseer George Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood, a common practice of the time, and several physicians{{efn|Doctors [[James Craik]], [[Gustavus Richard Brown]], and [[Elisha C. Dick]]. ([[Dr. William Thornton]] arrived some hours after Washington died.{{sfn|\"Death Defied\"}})}} were summoned.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=806\u201310}}{{sfn|Morens|1999|pp=1845-1849}}\n\nDr. Brown thought that Washington had \"[[Peritonsillar abscess|quinsey]]\" or \"quincy\", while Dick thought that the condition was a more serious \"violent inflammation of the throat\".{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=806\u2013807|Lear|1799|2p=257}} Continued blood-letting (approximately five pints) proved unsuccessful. Dick proposed an emergency [[tracheotomy]], but the other two doctors were unfamiliar with the new procedure and disapproved, so it was not used.{{sfnm|1a1=Chernow|1y=2010|1pp=806\u201310|2a1=Felisati|2a2=Sperati|2y=2005|2pp=55\u201358}} Washington instructed Brown and Dick to stop their attempts to save his life and leave the room, while he assured Craik, \"Doctor, I die hard, but I am not afraid to go\".{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=269}}\n\nWashington's illness and death came swiftly and unexpectedly.{{sfn|Ferling|2009|p=365}} He died peacefully with Martha calmly composed at the foot of his bed around 10 p.m. on Saturday, December 14, 1799 at age 67. His personal secretary Tobias Lear recorded his last words as \"'Tis well.\" Funeral arrangements were made by Washington's Masonic lodge of [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. When news of his death reached Congress, they immediately adjourned for the day and the Speaker's chair was shrouded in black the next morning.{{sfn|Irving|1869|p=359}}\n\nThe funeral was held on December 18, 1799 at Mount Vernon, where his body was interred. Cavalry and foot soldiers led the procession, while six colonels served as the pallbearers. The Mount Vernon funeral service was restricted mostly to family and friends. Congress chose [[Henry Lee III]] to deliver the eulogy, a Continental Army officer and loved by Washington. Word of his death traveled slowly; church bells rang in the cities, and many places of business closed.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=810\u2013811}} People worldwide admired Washington and were saddened by his death, and memorial processions were held in major cities of the United States. Martha wore a black mourning cape for one year, and she burned their correspondence to protect their privacy. Only five letters between the couple are known to have survived, two letters from Martha to George and three from him to her.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=814}}\n\n=== Subsequent diagnoses ===\nThe diagnosis of Washington's illness and the immediate cause of his death have been subjects of debate since the day that he died. In the days immediately following his death, Craik and Brown's published account{{efn|The first account of Washington's death was written by Doctors Craik and Brown, published in ''The Times'' of Alexandria five days after his death on December 19, 1799. It can be found in ''The Eclectic Medical Journal'' (1858){{sfnm|1a1=Newton|1a2=Freeman|1a3=Bickley|1y=1858|1pp=273\u2013274}}}} stated that his symptoms had been consistent with ''cynanche trachealis'', a term of that period used to describe severe inflammation of the structures of the upper airway. Accusations have persisted since Washington's death concerning medical malpractice, with some believing that he had been bled to death.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=806\u201310|2a1=Felisati|2a2=Sperati|2y=2005|2pp=55\u201358}} Various modern medical authors have speculated that he died from a severe case of [[epiglottitis]] complicated by the given treatments (which were all accepted medical practice in that day), most notably the massive deliberate blood loss, which almost certainly caused [[hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]].{{efn|Modern experts have concluded that Washington probably died from acute bacterial epiglottitis complicated by the administered treatments, including Morens and Wallenborn in 1999,{{sfn|Wallenborn|1999}}{{sfn|Morens|1999|pp=1845-1849}} Cheatham in 2008, {{sfn|Cheatham|2008}} and Vadakan in 2005.{{sfn|Vadakan|2005}} These treatments included multiple doses of [[Mercury(I) chloride|calomel]] (a cathartic or purgative) and extensive bloodletting.}}\n\n=== Burial ===\n[[File:Tomb of George Washington - wide - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|The Washington family tomb at Mount Vernon]]\n[[File:Washington Tomb.jpg|thumb|The sarcophagi of George (right) and Martha (left) Washington at the present tomb's entrance]]\n\nWashington was buried in the old family vault at Mount Vernon, situated on a grassy slope covered with juniper and cypress trees.

The crypt had been built by architect [[Charles Bulfinch]] in the 1820s during the reconstruction of the burned-out capital, after the [[Burning of Washington]] by the British during the [[War of 1812]]. Southern opposition was intense, antagonized by an ever-growing rift between North and South; many were concerned that Washington's remains could end up on \"a shore foreign to his native soil\" should the country become divided.{{sfn|Boorstin|1965|pp=349\u201350}}\n\nOn October 7, 1837, Washington's remains were placed, still in the original lead coffin, within a marble sarcophagus designed by William Strickland and constructed by John Struthers earlier that year.{{sfn|Strickland|1840|pp=11\u201314}}{{sfn|Carlson|2016|p=chapter one}} The sarcophagus was sealed and encased with planks, while an outer vault was constructed around it.{{sfn|Strickland|1840|pp=11\u201314}} The outer vault has the sarcophagi of George and Martha Washington; the inner vault has the remains of other Washington family members and relatives.<ref name = \"NewTomb\"/>\n\n== Historical reputation and legacy ==\n{{Main|Legacy of George Washington}}\n{{See also|Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|Cultural depictions of George Washington}}\n[[File:Stuart-george-washington-constable-1797.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The ''Constable-Hamilton Portrait'' by [[Gilbert Stuart]]]]\n\nWashington's legacy endures as one of the most influential in American history, since he served as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, a hero of the Revolution, and the first President of the United States.{{efn|Historians [[Jay A.

coast.]]\n\nThe '''Gulf Coast of the United States''' is the [[coastline]] along the [[Southern United States]] where they meet the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The [[coastal states]] that have a [[shoreline]] on the Gulf of Mexico are [[Texas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Florida]], and these are known as the ''Gulf States''.<ref>For example: {{Cite web|url=https://www.lsu.edu/ces/publications/2017/GCEO2017.pdf|title=Gulf Coast Energy Outlook|last=|first=|authorlink=|publisher=Center for Energy Studies|via=Economics & Policy Research Group|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414031817/https://www.lsu.edu/ces/publications/2017/GCEO2017.pdf|archive-date=13 Apr 2018|access-date=13 Apr 2018|edition=Spring 2017}}, p. 1 (\" Unless stated otherwise, Gulf Coast hereafter specifically refers to the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida\").</ref>\n\nThe economy of the Gulf Coast area is dominated by industries related to energy, petrochemicals, fishing, aerospace, agriculture, and tourism. The large cities of the region are (from west to east) [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]], [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]], [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], [[Houston]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[New Orleans]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], and increasingly, [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]]. All are the centers of their respective [[metropolitan area]]s and contain large [[port]]s. (Baton Rouge is relatively far from the Gulf of Mexico; its port is on the [[Mississippi River]], as is the port of New Orleans.)\n\n==Geography==\nThe Gulf Coast is made of many [[inlets]], [[bays]], and [[lagoons]]. The coast is also intersected by numerous rivers, the largest of which is the [[Mississippi River]]. Much of the land along the Gulf Coast is, or was, [[marsh]]land. Ringing the Gulf Coast is the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] which reaches from [[Southern Texas]] to the western [[Florida Panhandle]] while the western portions of the Gulf Coast are made up of many [[barrier island]]s and [[peninsula]]s, including the {{convert|130|mi|km}} [[Padre Island]] and [[Galveston Island]] located in the U.S. State of Texas. These landforms protect numerous [[bay]]s and [[inlet]]s providing as a barrier to oncoming waves. The central part of the Gulf Coast, from eastern Texas through Louisiana, consists primarily of marshland. The eastern part of the Gulf Coast, predominantly Florida, is dotted with many bays and inlets.\n\n===Climate===\nThe Gulf Coast climate is humid subtropical, although the southwestern tip of Florida, such as [[Naples, Florida|Naples]], features a tropical climate. Much of the year is warm to hot along the Gulf Coast, while the 3 winter months bring periods of cool (or rarely, cold) weather mixed with mild temperatures. The area is vulnerable to [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] as well as [[flood]]s and severe [[thunderstorm]]s. Much of the Gulf Coast has a summer precipitation maximum, with July or August commonly the wettest month due to the combination of frequent summer thunderstorms produced by relentless heat and humidity, and tropical weather systems (tropical depressions, tropical storms and [[hurricanes]]), while winter and early spring rainfall also can be heavy. This pattern is evident at [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], [[Mobile, Alabama]] and [[Pensacola, Florida]]. However, the central and southern [[Florida]] peninsula has a pronounced winter dry season, as at [[Tampa]] and [[Fort Myers]], Florida. On the central and southern Texas coast, winter, early spring and mid-summer are markedly drier, and September is the wettest month on average (as at [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] and [[Brownsville, Texas]]). [[Tornado]]es are infrequent at the coast but do occur; however, they occur more frequently in inland portions of Gulf Coast states. Over most of the Gulf Coast from [[Houston, Texas]] eastward, extreme rainfall events are a significant threat, commonly from tropical weather systems, which can bring 4 to 10 or more inches of rain in a single day. In August 2017, [[Hurricane Harvey]] made landfall along the central Texas coast, then migrated to and stalled over the greater [[Houston]] area for several days, producing extreme, unprecedented rainfall totals of over 40&nbsp;inches (1,000&nbsp;mm) in many areas, unleashing widespread flooding. [[Earthquakes]] are extremely rare to the area, but a surprising [[2006 Gulf of Mexico earthquake|6.0 earthquake]] in the Gulf of Mexico on September 10, 2006, could be felt from the cities of New Orleans to Tampa.\n\n==Economic activities==\n[[File:Gulf Coast Platforms.jpg|thumb|right|NOAA map of the 3,856 oil and gas platforms extant off the Gulf Coast in 2006.]]\nThe Gulf Coast is a major center of economic activity. The marshlands along the Louisiana and Texas coasts provide breeding grounds and nurseries for ocean life that drive the [[Fishing industry|fishing]] and [[shrimp]]ing industries. The [[Port of South Louisiana]] ([[Metropolitan New Orleans]] in [[Laplace, Louisiana|Laplace]]) and the [[Port of Houston]] are two of the ten busiest [[port]]s in the world by cargo volume.<ref name=\"Busiest Ports in the World\">{{cite web\n|url=http://geography.about.com/cs/transportation/a/aa061603.htm\n|title=Busiest Ports in the World\n|accessdate=2006-10-15\n|last=Rosenberg\n|first=Matt\n|date=2003-06-14\n}}</ref> As of 2004, seven of the top ten busiest ports in the U.S. are on the Gulf Coast.<ref name=\"Tonnage for Selected U.S. Ports in 2004\">{{cite web|url= http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/portname04.htm|title= Waterborne Commerce Statistics: Tonnage for Selected U.S. Ports in 2004|accessdate= 2006-10-15|author= |last= Rosenberg|first= Matt|date= June 14, 2003|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061117060215/http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/portname04.htm|archivedate= November 17, 2006|df= }}</ref>\n\nThe discovery of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] deposits along the coast and offshore, combined with easy access to shipping, have made the Gulf Coast the heart of the U.S. [[petrochemical industry]]. The coast contains nearly 4,000 [[oil platform]]s.\n\nBesides the above, the region features other important industries including [[aerospace]] and [[Texas Medical Center|biomedical research]], as well as older industries such as agriculture and&nbsp;\u2014 especially since the development of the Gulf Coast beginning in the 1920s and the increase in wealth throughout the United States&nbsp;\u2014 [[tourism]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:United States 1803-04-1804-03.png|thumb|Map of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]]]\n\nBefore Europeans arrived in the region, the region was home to several pre-Columbian kingdoms that had extensive trade networks with empires such as the Aztecs and the Mississippi Mound Builders. Shark and alligator teeth and shells from the Gulf have been found as far north as Ohio, in the mounds of the Hopewell culture.<ref>Nash, Gary B. ''Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America'' Los Angeles 2015. Chapter 1, p. 6</ref>\n\nThe first Europeans to settle the Gulf Coast were primarily the [[French Colonial Empire|French]] and the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]. The [[Louisiana Purchase]], [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] and the [[Texas Revolution]] made the Gulf Coast a part of the United States during the first half of the 19th century. As the U.S. population continued to expand its frontiers westward, the Gulf Coast was a natural magnet in the [[American South|South]] providing access to shipping lanes and both national and international commerce. The development of [[sugar]] and [[cotton]] production (enabled by [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]) allowed the South to prosper. By the mid 19th century the city of [[New Orleans]], being situated as a key to commerce on the [[Mississippi River]] and in the Gulf, had become the largest U.S. city not on the [[Atlantic seaboard]] and the fourth largest in the U.S. overall.\n\nTwo major events were turning points in the earlier history of the Gulf Coast region. The first was the [[American Civil War]], which caused severe damage to some economic sectors in the [[American South|South]], including the Gulf Coast. The second event was the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]]. At the end of the 19th century [[Galveston]] was, with New Orleans, one of the most developed cities in the region. The city had the third busiest port in the U.S.<ref name=\"Txfacts\">{{cite web |url= http://www.1900storm.com/isaaccline/isaacsstorm.lasso |title= The 1900 Storm |accessdate= 2006-07-11 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060711063120/http://www.1900storm.com/isaaccline/isaacsstorm.lasso |archivedate= 2006-07-11 |df=  }}</ref> and its financial district was known as the \"Wall Street of the South\".<ref name=\"GALVESTON.COM\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.galveston.com/history\n|title=Galveston, Texas History\n|accessdate=2007-10-15\n|work=Galveston.com\n|date=\n}}</ref> The storm mostly destroyed the city, which has never regained its former glory, and set back development in the region.\n\n[[File:Hurricane Katrina August 28 2005 NASA.jpg|thumb|[[Hurricane Katrina]]]]\nSince then the Gulf Coast has been hit with numerous other hurricanes.  In 2005, [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck the Gulf Coast as a [[Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 4|Category 5]] hurricane.  It was the [[List of costliest Atlantic hurricanes|most damaging storm]] in the history of the United States, causing upwards of $80 billion in damages, and leaving over 1,800 dead. Again in 2008 the Gulf Coast was struck by a catastrophic hurricane.

The gulf coast is highly populated. The petrochemical industry, launched with the major discoveries of oil in Texas and spurred on by further discoveries in the Gulf waters, has been a vehicle for development in the central and western Gulf which has spawned development on a variety of fronts in these regions. [[Texas]] in particular has benefited tremendously from this industry over the course of the 20th century and economic diversification has made the state a magnet for population and home to more [[Fortune 500]] companies than any other U.S. state. [[Florida]] has grown as well, driven to a great extent by its long established tourism industry but also by its position as a gateway to [[the Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]]. As of 2006, these two states are the second and fourth most populous states in the nation, respectively (see [[List of U.S. states by population|this article]]). Other areas of the Gulf Coast have benefited less, though economic development fueled by tourism has greatly increased property values along the coast, and is now a severe danger to the valuable but fragile ecosystems of the Gulf Coast.\n\n==Metropolitan areas==\nThe following table lists the 15 largest [[Metropolitan Statistical Areas|MSAs]] along the Gulf Coast.\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+<big>Metropolitan Statistical Areas on the United States Gulf Coast</big>\n!Rank\n!Metropolitan Statistical Area\n!2016 Pop (est.)\n!2000 Pop\n!\u0394 Pop\n!Combined Statistical Area\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|[[Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX MSA]]\n|align=right|6,772,470\n|align=right|4,715,407\n|align=right|{{hs|0061}}+24.43%\n|[[Houston-Baytown-Huntsville, TX CSA]]\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|[[Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL MSA]]\n|align=right|3,032,171\n|align=right|2,395,997\n|align=right|{{hs|0155}}+14.66%\n|{{hs|~}}[[primary census statistical area]]\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|[[New Orleans-Metairie-Kenner, LA MSA]]\n|align=right|1,268,883\n|align=right|1,316,510\n|align=right|{{hs|1090}}<span style=\"color:red;\">-9.61%</span>\n|[[New Orleans-Metairie-Bogalusa, LA CSA]]\n|-\n|align=center|4\n|[[McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, TX MSA]]\n|align=right|849,843\n|align=right|569,463\n|align=right|{{hs|0114}}+30.15%\n|[[primary census statistical area]]\n|-\n|align=center|5\n|[[Baton Rouge metropolitan area|Baton Rouge MSA]]\n|align=right|835,175\n|align=right|729,361\n|align=right|{{hs|0114}}+11.03%\n|{{hs|~}}[[primary census statistical area]]\n|-\n|align=center|6\n|[[North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, FL MSA]]\n|align=right|788,457\n|align=right|589,959\n|align=right|{{hs|0114}}+16.64%\n|[[Sarasota-Bradenton-Punta Gorda, FL CSA]]\n|-\n|align=center|7\n|[[Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FL MSA]]\n|align=right|722,336\n|align=right|440,888\n|align=right|{{hs|0015}}+33.12%\n|{{hs|~}}[[primary census statistical area]]\n|-\n|align=center|8\n|[[Pensacola-Ferry Pass-Brent, FL MSA]]\n|align=right|485,684\n|align=right|412,153\n|align=right|{{hs|0258}}+10.42%\n|{{hs|~}}[[primary census statistical area]]\n|-\n|align=center|9\n|[[Corpus Christi, TX MSA]]\n|align=right|454,726\n|align=right|403,280\n|align=right|{{hs|0610}}+3.18%\n|[[Corpus Christi-Kingsville, TX CSA]]\n|-\n|align=center|11\n|[[Mobile, AL MSA]]\n|align=right|414,836\n|align=right|399,843\n|align=right|{{hs|0712}}+2.97%\n|[[Mobile-Daphne-Fairhope, AL CSA]]\n|-\n|align=center|10\n|[[Brownsville\u2013Harlingen metropolitan area|Brownsville\u2013Harlingen, TX MSA]]\n|align=right|422,135\n|align=right|335,227\n|align=right|{{hs|0228}}+18.24%\n|{{hs|~}}[[Brownsville-Harlingen-Raymondville, TX CSA]]\n|-\n|align=center|12\n|[[Beaumont-Port Arthur, TX MSA]]\n|align=right|409,968\n|align=right|385,090\n|align=right|{{hs|0896}}<span style=\"color:red;\">-1.72%</span>\n|{{hs|~}}[[primary census statistical area]]\n|-\n|align=center|14\n|[[Naples-Marco Island, FL MSA]]\n|align=right|318,537\n|align=right|251,377\n|align=right|{{hs|0039}}+26.72%\n|{{hs|~}}[[primary census statistical area]]\n|-\n|align=center|13\n|[[Gulfport-Biloxi, MS MSA]]\n|align=right|365,136\n|align=right|246,190\n|align=right|{{hs|1017}}<span style=\"color:red;\">-3.01%</span>\n|[[Gulfport-Biloxi-Pascagoula, MS CSA]]\n|-\n|align=center|15\n|[[Houma-Bayou Cane-Thibodaux, LA MSA]]\n|align=right|211,525\n|align=right|194,477\n|align=right|{{hs|0590}}+4.37%\n|{{hs|~}}[[primary census statistical area]]\n|}\n</center>\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Road===\n\n====Major Interstates====\n[[File:45intoI-10 2.jpg|thumb|[[Interstate 45 (Texas)|I-45]] and [[Interstate 10 (Texas)|I-10]] near [[Downtown Houston]]]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Galaxy]] formation is hypothesized to occur from [[structure formation]] theories, as a result of tiny [[quantum fluctuation]]s in the aftermath of the [[Big Bang]]. The simplest model in general agreement with observed phenomena is the [[Lambda-CDM model]]\u2014that is, that clustering and merging allows galaxies to accumulate mass, determining both their shape and structure.\n\n==Commonly observed properties of galaxies==\n[[File:HubbleTuningFork.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hubble sequence|Hubble tuning fork diagram]] of galaxy morphology]]Because of the inability to conduct experiments in outer space, the only way to \u201ctest\u201d theories and models of galaxy evolution is to compare them with observations. Explanations for how galaxies formed and evolved must be able to predict the observed properties and types of galaxies.\n\n[[Edwin Hubble]] created the first galaxy classification scheme known as the Hubble tuning-fork diagram. It partitioned galaxies into [[Elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]], normal [[Spiral galaxy|spirals]], barred spirals (such as the [[Milky Way]]), and [[Irregular galaxy|irregulars]]. These galaxy types exhibit the following properties which can be explained by current galaxy evolution theories:\n\n* Many of the properties of galaxies (including the [[galaxy color\u2013magnitude diagram]]) indicate that there are fundamentally two types of galaxies. These groups divide into blue star-forming galaxies that are more like spiral types, and red non-star forming galaxies that are more like elliptical galaxies.\n* Spiral galaxies are quite thin, dense, and rotate relatively fast, while the stars in elliptical galaxies have randomly-oriented orbits.\n* The majority of giant galaxies contain a [[supermassive black hole]] in their centers, ranging in mass from millions to billions of times the mass of our [[Sun]]. The black hole mass is tied to the host galaxy bulge or spheroid mass.\n* [[Metallicity]] has a positive correlation with the [[absolute magnitude]] (luminosity) of a galaxy.\n\nThere is a common misconception that Hubble believed incorrectly that the tuning fork diagram described an evolutionary sequence for galaxies, from elliptical galaxies through [[Lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]] to spiral galaxies. This is not the case; instead, the tuning fork diagram shows an evolution from simple to complex with no temporal connotations intended.<ref>Hubble, Edwin P. \"Extragalactic nebulae.\" The Astrophysical Journal 64 (1926).</ref> Astronomers now believe that disk galaxies likely formed first, then evolved into elliptical galaxies through galaxy mergers.\n\nCurrent models also predict that the majority of mass in galaxies is made up of [[dark matter]], a substance which is not directly observable, and might not interact through any means except gravity. This observation arises because galaxies could not have formed as they have, or rotate as they are seen to, unless they contain far more mass than can be directly observed.\n\n==Formation of disk galaxies==\nThe earliest stage in the evolution of galaxies is the formation. When a galaxy forms, it has a disk shape and is called a spiral galaxy due to spiral-like \"arm\" structures located on the disk. There are different theories on how these disk-like distributions of stars develop from a cloud of matter: however, at present, none of them exactly predicts   the results of observation.\n\n=== Top-down theories ===\n[[Olin Eggen]], [[Donald Lynden-Bell]], and [[Allan Sandage]]<ref>{{cite journal | last = Eggen | first = O. J. | last2 = Lynden-Bell | first2 = D. | last3 = Sandage | first3 = A.

The distribution of matter in the early universe was in clumps that consisted mostly of dark matter. These clumps interacted gravitationally, putting tidal torques on each other that acted to give them some angular momentum. As the [[Baryon|baryonic matter]] cooled, it dissipated some energy and contracted toward the center. With angular momentum conserved, the matter near the center speeds up its rotation. Then, like a spinning ball of pizza dough, the matter forms into a tight disk. Once the disk cools, the gas is not gravitationally stable, so it cannot remain a singular homogeneous cloud. It breaks, and these smaller clouds of gas form stars. Since the dark matter does not dissipate as it only interacts gravitationally, it remains distributed outside the disk in what is known as the [[Dark matter halo|dark halo]]. Observations show that there are stars located outside the disk, which does not quite fit the \"pizza dough\" model. It was first proposed by [[Leonard Searle]] and Robert Zinn <ref>{{cite journal | last = Searle | first = L. |author2=Zinn, R. | date = 1978 | journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]] | title = Compositions of halo clusters and the formation of the galactic halo | bibcode = 1978ApJ...225..357S | volume = 225 | pages = 357\u2013379 | doi = 10.1086/156499}}</ref> that galaxies form by the coalescence of smaller progenitors. Known as a top-down formation scenario, this theory is quite simple yet no longer widely accepted.\n\n=== Bottom-up theories ===\nMore recent theories include the clustering of dark matter halos in the bottom-up process. Instead of large gas clouds collapsing to form a galaxy in which the gas breaks up into smaller clouds, it is proposed that matter started out in these \u201csmaller\u201d clumps (mass on the order of [[globular cluster]]s), and then many of these clumps merged to form galaxies,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Simon|last2=Rees|first2=Martin|date=1978|title=Core condensation in heavy halos: a two-stage theory for galaxy formation and clustering.|url=|journal=MNRAS|doi=10.1093/mnras/183.3.341|pmid=|access-date=|bibcode = 1978MNRAS.183..341W|volume=183|pages=341\u2013358}}</ref> which then were drawn by gravitation to form [[galaxy cluster]]s. This still results in disk-like distributions of baryonic matter with dark matter forming the halo for all the same reasons as in the top-down theory. Models using this sort of process predict more small galaxies than large ones, which matches observations.\n\nAstronomers do not currently know what process stops the contraction. In fact, theories of disk galaxy formation are not successful at producing the rotation speed and size of disk galaxies. It has been suggested that the radiation from bright newly formed stars, or from an [[active galactic nucleus]] can slow the contraction of a forming disk. It has also been suggested that the [[dark matter]] halo can pull the galaxy, thus stopping disk contraction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cosmic Collisions: The Hubble Atlas of Merging Galaxies.|last=Christensen|first=L.L.|last2=de Martin|first2=D.|last3=Shida|first3=R.Y.|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9780387938530|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lambda-CDM model]] is a cosmological model that explains the formation of the universe after the [[Big Bang]].

If disk galaxies merge with another galaxy of comparable mass (at least 15 percent of its mass) the merger will likely destroy, or at a minimum greatly disrupt the disk, and the resulting galaxy is not expected to be a disk galaxy (see next section). While this remains an unsolved problem for astronomers, it does not necessarily mean that the Lambda-CDM model is completely wrong, but rather that it requires further refinement to accurately reproduce the population of galaxies in the universe.\n\n==Galaxy mergers and the formation of elliptical galaxies==\n[[File:14-23000-Sparky-MassiveGalaxyFormation-20140827.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Artist image of a firestorm of star birth deep inside core of young, growing elliptical galaxy.]]\n[[File:NGC4676.jpg|thumb|200px|right|NGC 4676 ([[Mice Galaxies]]) is an example of a present merger.]]\n[[File:Antennae galaxies xl.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Antennae Galaxies]] are a pair of colliding galaxies - the bright, blue knots are young stars that have recently ignited as a result of the merger.]]\n[[File:Abell S740, cropped to ESO 325-G004.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[ESO 325-G004]], a typical elliptical galaxy.]]\n{{Main|Galaxy merger}}\nElliptical galaxies (such as [[IC 1101]]) are among some of the largest known thus far.

There are no precise dates for when Generation X starts or ends.  Demographers and researchers typically use birth years ranging from the early-to-mid 1960s to the early 1980s.\n\nMembers of Generation X were children during a time of shifting societal values and as children were sometimes called the \"[[latchkey kid|latchkey]] generation\", due to reduced adult supervision as children compared to previous generations, a result of increasing [[divorce]] rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce, prior to widespread availability of childcare options outside the home. As adolescents and young adults, they were dubbed the \"[[MTV Generation]]\" (a reference to the [[MTV|music video channel of the same name]]). In the 1990s they were sometimes characterized as [[slackers]], [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] and disaffected.  Some of the cultural influences on Gen X youth were the musical genres of [[punk music]], [[heavy metal music]], [[grunge]] and [[hip hop music]], and [[indie film]]s. In midlife, research describes them as active, happy, and achieving a [[work\u2013life balance]]. The cohort has been credited with [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] tendencies.\n\n==Origin of term==\n[[File:Douglas Coupland Photo of Author.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|200px|[[Douglas Coupland]] popularized the term \"Generation X\" in his 1991 novel ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]''.]]\nThe term \"Generation X\" has been used at various times throughout history to describe alienated youth.

Strauss also noted that around the time Coupland's 1991 novel was published the symbol \"X\" was prominent in popular culture, as the film ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'' was released in 1992, and that the name \"Generation X\" ended up sticking.

They found much of the cultural identity of the baby-boomer generation is associated with the \"older boomers\", while half of the \"younger boomers\" were averse to being associated with the baby-boomer cohort and a third of those born between 1956 and 1964 actively identified as members of Generation X.<ref>{{cite news|title=Boomer Bookend: Insight Into the Oldest and Youngest Boomers|url=https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/mmi-boomer-bookends.pdf|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=MetLife|date=February 2009}}</ref>\n\nDemographers [[Strauss\u2013Howe generational theory|William Strauss and Neil Howe]] rejected the frequently used 1964 end-date of the baby-boomer cohort (which results in a 1965 start-year for Generation X), saying that a majority of those born between 1961 and 1964 do not self-identify as boomers, and that they are culturally distinct from boomers in terms of shared historical experiences.

[[Chamorros]] indigenous island people from the Northern Marianas were brought to Guam to serve as interpreters and in other capacities for the occupying Japanese force. The Guamanian Chamorros were treated as an occupied enemy by the Japanese military.

Guam's Chamorros believed their northern brethren should have been compassionate towards them, whereas having been administered by Japan for over 30 years, the Northern Mariana Chamorros were loyal to the Japanese government.\n\nThe Japanese occupation of Guam lasted for approximately thirty-one months. During this period, the indigenous people of Guam were subjected to forced labor, family separation, incarceration, execution, concentration camps and forced prostitution.

However, due to its proximity to the [[equator]], high sea surface temperature and warm [[ocean current]] that transports heat and moisture, the weather is generally very warm and humid throughout the year with little seasonal temperature variation. Hence, Guam is known to have equable temperatures year round. The mean high temperature is {{convert|86|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or}} and mean low is {{convert|76|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|1}}. Temperatures rarely exceed {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|1}} or fall below {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|1}}. The relative humidity commonly exceeds 84 percent at night throughout the year, but the average monthly humidity hovers near 66 percent. The dry season runs from December to June. The remaining months (July to November) constitute the wet season with an average annual rainfall between 1981 and 2010 of around {{convert|98|in|mm|-1|disp=or|sp=us}}. The months of January and February are considered the coolest months of the year with overnight low temperatures of {{convert|70|to|75|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|1}} and generally less oppressive humidity levels. The highest temperature ever recorded in Guam was {{convert|96|F|C|1}} on April 18, 1971, and April 1, 1990, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|65|F|C|1}} on February 8, 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/getclimate.php?date=&wfo=guam&sid=GUM&pil=CLM&recent=yes&specdate=2013-03-04+15%3A20%3A44|title=Climatological Report|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=February 26, 2014|date=February 26, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307004247/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/getclimate.php?date=&wfo=guam&sid=GUM&pil=CLM&recent=yes&specdate=2013-03-04+15%3A20%3A44|archivedate=March 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nGuam is located in ''Typhoon Alley''<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service Dedicated Forecast Office in Typhoon Alley|url=http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2000/apr00/noaa00r235.html|publisher=US NOAA NWS|accessdate=August 19, 2012|date=April 27, 2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107012415/http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2000/apr00/noaa00r235.html|archivedate=January 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and it is common for the island to be threatened by tropical storms and possible [[typhoon]]s during the wet season.

Few indigenous pre-Hispanic customs remained following Spanish contact. Hispanic influences are manifested in the local language, music, dance, sea navigation, cuisine, fishing, games (such as batu, chonka, estuleks, and bayogu), songs and fashion.\n\nDuring Spanish colonial rule (1668\u20131898) the majority of the population was converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] and religious festivities such as Easter and Christmas became widespread. Post-contact Chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn, and includes tortillas, tamales, atole and chilaquiles, which are a clear influence from [[Mesoamerica]], principally Mexico, from Spanish trade with Asia.\n\nThe modern [[Chamorro language]] has many historical parallels to modern [[Philippine languages]] in that it is an [[Austronesian language]] which has absorbed much Spanish vocabulary. The language lies within the [[Malayo-Polynesian language]]s subgroup, along with such languages as Tagalog, Indonesian, Hawaiian, and Maori. Despite being spoken in the mid Pacific Ocean, which is geographically closer to speakers of the Polynesian Islands, Chamorro is actually a linguistic outlier of the [[Sunda\u2013Sulawesi languages]], and is thus more closely related to, and a part of, the languages of the [[Malay Archipelago]], rather than its neighbours in Polynesia. Among the languages of the Malay Archipelago, Chamorro is most closely related to the languages at the south of archipelago, in Indonesia, rather than the languages at the north, in the Philippines, with which it otherwise shares colonial linguistic influence from Spanish.\n\nAs with [[Filipinos]], many Chamorros have [[Spanish name|Spanish surnames]], although also like most Filipinos few of the inhabitants are themselves descended from the Spanish colonizers. Instead, Spanish names and surnames became commonplace after their conversion to Roman Catholic Christianity and the historical event of the imposition of the [[Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos]] in Guam and other territories of the [[Spanish East Indies]], most notably the Philippines.\n\nDue to foreign cultural influence from Spain, most aspects of the early indigenous culture have been lost, though there has been a resurgence in preserving any remaining pre-Hispanic culture in the last few decades. Some scholars have traveled throughout the Pacific Islands conducting research to study what the original Chamorro cultural practices such as dance, language, and canoe building may have been like.\n[[File:Puntan Dos Amantes (Guam) - DSC01150.JPG|left|thumb|''Puntan Dos Amantes'' (\"Two Lovers Point\"), a [[National Natural Landmark]],<ref name=\"NPS PdA\">{{cite web |title=Puntan dos Amantes |url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/nnl/site.cfm?Site=PUDO-GU |work=NPS: Explore Nature |publisher=The US National Park Service |accessdate=September 9, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120030253/http://www.nature.nps.gov/nnl/site.cfm?Site=PUDO-GU |archivedate=January 20, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> well known for its romantic associations]]\n\nTwo aspects of indigenous pre-Hispanic culture that withstood time are chenchule' and inafa'maolek. Chenchule' is the intricate system of reciprocity at the heart of Chamorro society. It is rooted in the core value of inafa'maolek. Historian Lawrence Cunningham in 1992 wrote, \"In a Chamorro sense, the land and its produce belong to everyone. {{lang|ch|[[Inafa'maolek]]}}, or interdependence, is the key, or central value, in Chamorro culture&nbsp;... {{lang|ch|Inafa'maolek}} depends on a spirit of cooperation and sharing. This is the armature, or core, that everything in Chamorro culture revolves around. It is a powerful concern for mutuality rather than [[individualism]] and private property rights.\"\n\nThe core culture or Pengngan Chamorro is based on complex social protocol centered upon respect: from sniffing over the hands of the elders (called mangnginge in Chamorro), the passing down of legends, chants, and courtship rituals, to a person asking for permission from spiritual ancestors before entering a jungle or ancient battle grounds. Other practices predating Spanish conquest include [[Outrigger canoe|galaide']] canoe-making, making of the [[belembaotuyan]] (a string musical instrument made from a gourd), fashioning of ''{{lang|ch|\u00e5cho' atupat}}'' slings and slingstones, tool manufacture, {{lang|ch|[[M\u00e5tan Guma']]}} burial rituals, and preparation of herbal medicines by [[Suruhanu]].\n\nMaster craftsmen and women specialize in weavings, including plaited work ([[coconut|niyok]]- and [[pandanus|\u00e5kgak]]-leaf baskets, mats, bags, hats, and food containments), loom-woven material ([[plumeria|kalachucha-hibiscus]] and banana fiber skirts, belts and burial shrouds), and body ornamentation (bead and shell necklaces, bracelets, earrings, belts and combs made from tortoise shells and [[Spondylus]]).\n\nThe cosmopolitan and multicultural nature of modern Guam poses challenges for Chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity amidst forces of acculturation. The increasing numbers of Chamorros, especially Chamorro youth, relocating to the U.S. Mainland has further complicated both definition and preservation of Chamorro identity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} While only a few masters exist to continue traditional art forms, the resurgence of interest among the Chamorros to preserve the language and culture has resulted in a growing number of young Chamorros who seek to continue the ancient ways of the Chamorro people.\n\n===Sports===\n====Pacific Games====\nGuam hosted the [[Pacific Games]] in 1975 and 1999.

Guam currently serves twelve submarine cables, with most continuing to China.\n\n[[File:US to Guam First Flight Cover 1935.jpg|thumb|right|Cover carried both directions on the first commercial flights between Guam and the United States, October 5\u201324, 1935.]]\nIn 1899, the local postage stamps were overprinted \"Guam\" as was done for the other former Spanish colonies, but this was discontinued shortly thereafter and regular U.S. postage stamps have been used ever since. Because Guam is also part of the U.S. Postal System ([[List of U.S. state abbreviations|postal abbreviation]]: GU, [[ZIP code|ZIP code range]]: 96910\u201396932), mail to Guam from the U.S. mainland is considered domestic and no additional charges are required. Private shipping companies, such as FedEx, UPS, and DHL, however, have no obligation to do so, and do not regard Guam as domestic.\n\nThe speed of mail traveling between Guam and the states varies depending on size and time of year. Light, first-class items generally take less than a week to or from the mainland, but larger first-class or Priority items can take a week or two. Fourth-class mail, such as magazines, are transported by sea after reaching Hawaii. Most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes, although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available. Incoming mail not from the Americas should be addressed to \"Guam\" instead of \"USA\" to avoid being routed the long way through the U.S. mainland and possibly charged a higher rate (especially from Asia).\n\nThe Commercial Port of Guam is the island's lifeline because most products must be shipped into Guam for consumers.  It receives the weekly calls of the Hawaii-based shipping line [[Matson, Inc.]] whose container ships connect Guam with Honolulu, Hawaii, Los Angeles, California, Oakland, California and Seattle, Washington. The port is also the regional transhipment hub for over 500,000 customers throughout the Micronesian region.  The port is the shipping and receiving point for containers designated for the island's U.S. Department of Defense installations, Andersen Air Force Base and Commander, Naval Forces Marianas and eventually the Third Marine Expeditionary Force.\n\nGuam is served by the [[Antonio B.

Since Guam is under federal immigration jurisdiction, passengers arriving directly from the United States skip immigration and proceed directly to Guam Customs and Quarantine.\n\nHowever, due to the [[Visa waiver program#Guam and Northern Mariana Islands Visa Waiver Program|Guam and CNMI visa waiver program]] for certain countries, an eligibility pre-clearance check is carried on Guam for flights to the States. For travel from the Northern Mariana Islands to Guam, a pre-flight passport and visa check is performed before boarding the flight to Guam. On flights from Guam to the Northern Mariana Islands, no immigration check is performed. Traveling between Guam and the States through a foreign point, however, does require a passport.\n\nMost residents travel within Guam using personally owned vehicles. The local government currently outsources the only public bus system ([[Guam Regional Transit Authority]]), and some commercial companies operate buses between tourist-frequented locations.\n\n==Ecology==\n===Brown tree snake===\n[[File:Brown tree snake Boiga irregularis USGS Photograph.sized.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brown tree snake]]]]\nBelieved to be a [[stowaway]] on a U.S. military transport near the end of World War II, the [[brown tree snake]] (''Boiga irregularis'') was accidentally introduced to Guam, which previously had no native species of snake. It nearly eliminated the native bird population. The problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island. The brown tree snake, known locally as the ''kulebla'', is native to northern and eastern coasts of [[Australia]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and the [[Solomon Islands]]. It is slightly venomous, but relatively harmless to human beings; it is nocturnal. Although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on Guam, residents rarely see them. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the island's cargo flow. The [[United States Geological Survey]] also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the region's islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fort.usgs.gov/Resources/Education/BTS/ |title=USGS: The Brown Tree Snake on Guam |accessdate=July 28, 2007 |author=Fritts, T.H. |author2=D.

CRB is not known to occur in the United States except in [[American Samoa]]. Delimiting surveys performed September 13\u201325, 2007, indicated that the infestation was limited to Tumon Bay and Faifai Beach, an area of approximately {{convert|900|acre|km2}}. Guam Department of Agriculture (GDA) placed quarantine on all properties within the Tumon area on October 5 and later expanded the quarantine to about {{convert|2500|acre|km2}} on October 25; approximately {{convert|0.5|mi|m}} radius in all directions from all known locations of CRB infestation. CRB is native to Southern Asia and distributed throughout Asia and the Western Pacific including [[Sri Lanka]], [[Upolu]], [[Samoa]], American Samoa, [[Palau]], [[New Britain]], [[West Papua (region)|West Irian]], [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], [[Manus Island|Pak Island and Manus Island]] (New Guinea), [[Fiji]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], [[Mauritius]], and [[R\u00e9union|Reunion]].\n\n===Other invasive animal species===\n[[File:2011 Feb, Puerto Princesa to Nasiduan, 10.jpg|thumb|upright|Adult female [[carabao]] and calf]]\nFrom the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries, the Spanish introduced pigs, dogs, chickens, the [[Philippine deer]] (''Rusa mariannus''), [[black francolin]]s, and [[carabao]] (a subspecies of [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]]), which have cultural significance.  Herds of carabao obstruct military base operations and harm native ecosystems.  After birth control and adoption efforts were ineffective, the U.S. military began culling the herds in 2002 leading to organized protests from island residents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animalrights.net/archives/year/2003/000392.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428185829/http://www.animalrights.net/archives/year/2003/000392.html |archivedate=April 28, 2005 |publisher=AnimalRights.net |title=More Than 100 Protest Guam Carabao Cull |date=October 15, 2003 |accessdate=June 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOther introduced species include [[cane toad]]s introduced in 1937, the [[Achatina achatina|giant African snail]] (an agricultural pest introduced during World War&nbsp;II by Japanese occupation troops) and more recently frog species which could threaten crops in addition to providing additional food for the [[brown tree snake]] population.

''[[Litoria fallax]]'' (native to the eastern coast of Australia) has been present in Guam since 1968, and ''[[Rhinella marina]]'' (the cane toad) was brought to the island in 1937. The other 6 amphibian species, namely ''[[Hylarana guentheri]]'' (native to mainland Asia), ''[[Microhyla pulchra]]'' (native to mainland Asia), ''[[Polypedates braueri]]'' (endemic to Taiwan), ''[[Eleutherodactylus planirostris]]'' (native to the Caribbean), ''[[Fejervarya cancrivora]]'' (the Guam variety being most closely related to ''F. cancrivora'' found in Taiwan), and ''[[Fejervarya limnocharis]]'' (native to Southeast Asia), have been in Guam since 2003.<ref>Wostl, Elijah, Eric N.

Tinangaja, a [[Plant virus|virus]] affecting coconut palms, was first observed on the island in 1917 when [[copra]] production was still a major part of Guam's economy. Though coconut plantations no longer exist on the island, the dead and infected trees that have resulted from the epidemic are seen throughout the forests of Guam.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hodgson |first=R.

Much of Guam's foliage was lost during [[World War II]].  In 1947, the U.S. military is thought to have planted tangan-tangan by seeding the island from the air to prevent [[erosion]]. Tangan-tangan was present on the island before 1905.<ref>Stafford, William Edwin (1905) ''Useful Plants of Guam''</ref>\n\nIn southern Guam, non-native grass species dominate much of the landscape.

Invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas. Grasslands and \"barrens\" have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion. During the rainy season, sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the [[Fena Lake]] Reservoir and [[Ugum River]], leading to water quality problems for southern Guam. Eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island. Soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers (planting trees) have had little success in preserving natural habitats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/Park/Natural/fire/fireguam.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213232039/http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/Park/Natural/fire/fireguam.htm|archivedate=December 13, 2007| work=[[United States Department of the Interior]] |author=[[National Park Service]] |title=Fire and Guam |accessdate=June 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Aquatic preserves===\n[[File:Tumon Beach.JPG|thumb|Having previously experienced extensive [[dredging]], Tumon Bay is now a marine wildlife preserve.]]\n[[File:Whitespotted boxfish Ostracion meleagris photo Randall J E.jpg|thumb|[[Whitespotted boxfish]] (''[[Ostracion meleagris]]'')]]\nEfforts have been made to protect Guam's coral reef habitats from pollution, eroded silt and overfishing, problems that have led to decreased fish populations.

The gaming device was the brainchild of long-time Nintendo employee [[Gunpei Yokoi]], who was the person behind the ''[[Ultra Hand]]'', an expanding arm toy created and produced by Nintendo in 1970, long before Nintendo would enter the video game market. Yokoi was also responsible for the [[Game & Watch]] series of handhelds when Nintendo made the move from toys to video games.\n\nWhen Yokoi designed the original Game Boy, he knew that to be successful, the system needed to be small, light, inexpensive, and durable, as well as have a varied, recognizable library of games upon its release. By following this simple mantra, the Game Boy line managed to gain a vast following despite technically superior alternatives which would have [[Liquid-crystal display|color graphics]] instead. This is also apparent in the name (conceived by [[Shigesato Itoi]]), which connotes a smaller \"sidekick\" companion to Nintendo's consoles.\n\nGame Boy continues its success to this day and many at Nintendo have dedicated the handheld in Yokoi's memory. Game Boy celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2004, which nearly coincided with the 20-year anniversary of the original [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). To celebrate, Nintendo released the [[Classic NES Series]] and an NES controller-themed color scheme for the [[Game Boy Advance SP]].\n\nIn 2006, Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]] said on the rumored<ref>{{cite news |first=Daemon |last=Hatfield| title=E3 2006: Nintendo Hints at Game Boy's End |url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/708/708063p1.html |work= IGN.com News |date=2006-05-11 |accessdate=2007-01-21}}</ref> demise of the Game Boy brand: \"No, it's not true after all.

Perhaps they misunderstood a part of this story, but as far as the handheld market is concerned [right now] we really want to focus on more sales of the DS; that's all.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Brightman |title=Exclusive Interview: Satoru Iwata |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/exclusive-interview-satoru-iwata/68962/?biz=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314042110/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/exclusive-interview-satoru-iwata/68962/?biz=1 |dead-url=yes |archivedate=2008-03-14 |work=GameDaily BIZ |date=2006-05-22 |accessdate=2007-01-21 |df= }} Archived from on 2009-03-04.</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Game Boy family ==\n\n=== Game Boy ===\n{{Main|Game Boy}}\n[[File:Game-Boy-FL.jpg|thumb|upright|130px|Game Boy]]\nThe original gray Game Boy was first released in [[Japan]] on April 21, 1989. Based on a [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor, it has a black and green reflective [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] screen, an eight-way directional pad, two action buttons (A and B), and Start and Select buttons with the controls being identical to the NES controller. It plays games from [[Read-only memory|ROM]]-based media contained in [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]] (sometimes called carts or Game Paks). Its graphics are 8-bit (similar to the NES).\n\nThe game that pushed the Game Boy into the upper reaches of success was ''[[Tetris (Game Boy)|Tetris]]''. Tetris was widely popular, and on the handheld format could be played anywhere. It came packaged with the Game Boy, and broadened its reach; adults and children alike were buying Game Boys in order to play ''Tetris''. Releasing ''Tetris'' on the Game Boy was selected as #4 on [[GameSpy]]'s \"25 Smartest Moments in Gaming\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Tetris Makes Game Boy a Must-Have |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/25smartest/index23.shtml |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ytcZP66s?url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/25smartest/index23.shtml |archivedate=2011-05-23 |accessdate=2007-01-21 |format=SHTML |publisher=GameSpy |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe original Game Boy was one of the first cartridge-based systems that supported more than four players at one time (via the link port). In fact, it has been shown that the system could support 16 simultaneous players. However, this feature was only supported in ''[[Faceball 2000]]''.\n\nIn 1995, the \"Play it Loud\" version of the original Game Boy was released in five different colors; red, yellow, green, black and clear.\n\n==== Game Boy Pocket ====\n{{Main|Game Boy#Game Boy Pocket}}\nThe Game Boy Pocket is a redesigned version of the original Game Boy having the same features. It was released in 1996. Notably, this variation is smaller and lighter. It comes in seven different colors; red, yellow, green, black, clear, silver, blue, and pink.\n\nAnother notable improvement over the original Game Boy is a black-and-white display screen, rather than the green-tinted display of the original Game Boy, that also featured improved response time for less blurring during motion. The Game Boy Pocket takes two [[AAA batteries]] as opposed to four AA batteries for roughly ten hours of gameplay. The first model of the Game Boy Pocket did not have an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] to show battery levels, but the feature was added due to public demand.\n\n==== Game Boy Light ====\n{{Main|Game Boy#Game Boy Light}}\nIn April 1998, a variant of the Game Boy Pocket named Game Boy Light was exclusively released in Japan. The differences between the original Game Boy Pocket and the Game Boy Light is that the Game Boy Light takes on two AA batteries rather than two AAA batteries and has an [[electroluminescent]] screen that can be turned on or off. This electroluminescent screen allowed the use of it in darkened areas. It also comes in six different colors; silver, gold, yellow for the ''Pokemon'' edition, translucent yellow, clear and translucent red for the ''Astro Boy'' edition. The Game Boy Light was superseded by the Game Boy Color six months later and was the only Game Boy to have a backlit screen until the release of the Game Boy Advance SP AGS-101 model in 2005.\n\n=== Game Boy Color ===\n[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Color-FL.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Game Boy Color]]\n{{Main|Game Boy Color}}\nFirst released in Japan on October 21, 1998, the Game Boy Color (abbreviated as GBC) added a (slightly smaller) color screen to a form factor similar in size to the Game Boy Pocket. It also has double the processor speed, three times as much memory,<ref>Game Boy has 8&nbsp;KiB of RAM and 8&nbsp;KiB of VRAM. Game Boy Color has 32&nbsp;KiB of RAM and 16&nbsp;KiB of VRAM.</ref> and an [[infrared]] communications port. Technologically, it was likened to the 8-bit [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] [[video game console]] from the 1980s although the Game Boy Color has a much larger color palette (56 simultaneous colors out of 32,768 possible) which had some classic NES ports and newer titles. It comes in seven different colors; Clear purple, purple, red, blue, green, yellow and silver for the ''Pokemon'' edition. Like the Game Boy Light, the Game Boy Color takes on two AA batteries. It was the final handheld to have 8-bit graphics.\n\nA major component of the Game Boy Color is its near-universal [[backward compatibility]]; that is, a Game Boy Color is able to read older Game Boy cartridges and even play them in a selectable color palette (similar to the Super Game Boy). The only black & white Game Boy games known to be incompatible are ''[[Road Rash]]'' and ''[[Joshua & the Battle of Jericho]]''. Backwards compatibility became a major feature of the Game Boy line, since it allowed each new launch to begin with a significantly larger library than any of its competitors. Some games written specifically for the Game Boy Color can be played on older model Game Boys, whereas others cannot (see the [[#Game Paks|Game Paks]] section for more information).\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Game Boy Advance family ==\n{{Main|Game Boy Advance family}}\n\n=== Game Boy Advance ===\n[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Advance-Milky-Blue-FL.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Game Boy Advance]]\n{{Main|Game Boy Advance}}\nIn Japan, on March 21, 2001, Nintendo released a significant upgrade to the Game Boy line. The Game Boy Advance (also referred to as GBA) featured a 32 bit 16.8 [[Hertz|MHz]] [[ARM architecture|ARM]]. It included a [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor and a switch activated by inserting a Game Boy or Game Boy Color game into the slot for backward compatibility, and had a larger, higher resolution screen. Controls were slightly modified with the addition of \"L\" and \"R\" shoulder buttons. Like the Game Boy Light and Game Boy Color, the Game Boy Advance takes on two AA batteries. The system was technically likened to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and showed its power with successful ports of SNES titles such as ''[[Super Mario Advance 2|Super Mario World]]'', ''[[Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3|Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four Swords|The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''. There were also new titles that could be found only on the GBA, such as ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'', ''[[F-Zero: Maximum Velocity]]'', ''[[Wario Land 4]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and more. A widely criticized drawback of the Game Boy Advance is that the screen is not [[Backlight|backlit]], making viewing difficult in some conditions. The Game Paks for the GBA are roughly half the length of original Game Boy cartridges and Game Boy Color cartridges, and so older Game Paks would stick out of the top of the unit. When playing older games, the GBA provides the option to play the game at the standard equal square resolution of the original screen or the option to stretch it over the wider GBA screen. The selectable color palettes for the original Game Boy games are identical to what it was on the Game Boy Color. The only Game Boy Color games known to be incompatible are ''Pocket Music''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.gg8.se/wordpress/2013/12/17/pocket-music-gbc-version-gba-fix/|title=Gameboy Genius \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb Pocket Music GBC version GBA fix|website=blog.gg8.se|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> and ''[[Chee-Chai Alien]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://valken.obihimo.com/351-/367-Dobu-little-Ailian/liite.htm|title=\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u65e5\u8a18\u3000\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u6700\u5f37\u4f1d\u8aac\u3000\u3061\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3044\u30a8\u30a4\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3\u3000\u8fd1\u6240\u306e\u30aa\u30d0\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u306b\u805e\u3044\u305f\u3089\u300c\u3042\u306e\u30e1\u30b0\u30fb\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u304c\u7d76\u8cdb\u3057\u305f\u300d\u3068\u304b\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\uff01\uff1f\uff1f|website=valken.obihimo.com|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://page.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/n250131735|title=\u4e2d\u53e4 [\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0/GB] \u3061\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3044\u30a8\u30a4\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3; \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0... - \u30e4\u30d5\u30aa\u30af!|website=\u30e4\u30d5\u30aa\u30af!|language=ja|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> It was the final handheld to require regular batteries.\n\n=== Game Boy Advance SP ===\n[[File:Gameboy-Advance-SP-Mk2.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Game Boy Advance SP]]\n{{Main|Game Boy Advance SP}}\nFirst released in Japan on February 14, 2003, the Game Boy Advance SP\u2014Nintendo model AGS-001\u2014resolved several problems with the original Game Boy Advance model. It featured a new smaller [[Flip (form)|clamshell]] design with a flip-up screen, a switchable internal frontlight, a rechargeable battery for the first time, and the only notable issue is the omission of the headphone jack, which requires a special adapter, purchased separately. In some regions, owners of the original Game Boy Advance received a special limited offer to trade their old models into Nintendo and merely pay the difference on the Game Boy Advance SP.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} In September 2005, Nintendo released the Game Boy Advance SP model AGS-101, that featured a high quality [[backlight|backlit]] screen instead of a [[Frontlight|frontlit]], similar to the Game Boy Micro screen but larger. It was the final Game Boy and last handheld to have backwards compatibility with Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.\n\n=== Game Boy Micro ===\n[[File:Game-Boy-Micro.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Game Boy Micro]]\n{{Main|Game Boy Micro}}\nThe third form of Game Boy Advance system, the Game Boy Micro is four and a half inches wide (10&nbsp;cm), two inches tall (5&nbsp;cm), and weighs 2.8 ounces (80&nbsp;g). By far the smallest Game Boy created, it has approximately the same dimensions as an original NES controller pad. Its screen is approximately 2/3 the size of the SP and GBA screens while maintaining the same resolution (240\u00d7160 pixels) but now has a higher quality backlit display with adjustable brightness. Included with the system are two additional faceplates which can be swapped to give the system a new look; Nintendo of America sold additional faceplates on its online store. In Europe, the Game Boy Micro comes with a single faceplate. In Japan, a special ''[[Mother 3]]'' limited edition Game Boy Micro was released with the game in the ''Mother 3 Deluxe Box''. Unlike the Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Advance SP, the Game Boy Micro is unable to play any original Game Boy or Game Boy Color games, only playing Game Boy Advance titles (with the exception of the [[Nintendo e-Reader]], discontinued in America, but still available in Japan).\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Comparison ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+Comparison of the Game Boy game systems\n|-\n!Product family\n! colspan=3 | [[Game Boy Advance family|Game Boy Advance]]\n! colspan=1 | Game Boy Color\n! colspan=3 | Game Boy\n|-\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| Name\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| [[Game Boy Micro]]\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| [[Game Boy Advance SP]]\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| [[Game Boy Advance]]\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| Game Boy Color\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| [[Game Boy Light]]\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| [[Game Boy Pocket]]\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| Game Boy\n|-\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| Model #\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| OXY-001\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| AGS-001 / AGS-101\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| AGB-001\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| CGB-001\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| MGB-101\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| MGB-001\n! style=\"width:12.5%;\"| DMG-01\n|-\n!

All cartridges, excluding those for Game Boy Advance, measure 5.8 by 6.5&nbsp;cm. The cartridge provides the code and game data to the console's CPU. Some cartridges include a small battery with SRAM, [[flash memory]] chip, or EEPROM, which allows game data to be saved when the console is turned off. If the battery runs out in a cartridge, then the save data will be lost, however, it is possible to replace the battery with a new battery. To do this, the cartridge must be unscrewed, opened up, and the old battery would be removed and replaced. This may require desoldering the dead battery and soldering the replacement in place. Before 2003, Nintendo used round, flat watch batteries for saving information on the cartridges. These batteries were replaced in newer cartridges because they could only live for a certain amount of time.\n\nThe cartridge is inserted into the console cartridge slot. If the cartridge is removed while the power is on, and the Game Boy does not automatically reset, the game freezes; the Game Boy may exhibit unexpected behavior, such as rows of zeros appearing on the screen, the sound remaining at the same pitch as was emitted the instant the game was pulled out, saved data may be [[Data corruption|corrupted]], and hardware may be damaged. This applies to most [[video game console]]s that use cartridges.\n\nThe original Game Boy power switch was designed to prevent the player from being able to remove the cartridge while the power is on. Cartridges intended only for Game Boy Color (and not for the original Game Boy) lack the \"notch\" for the locking mechanism present in the top of the original cartridges, preventing operation on an original Game Boy (the cartridge can be inserted, but the power switch cannot be moved to the \"on\" position). Even if this was bypassed by using a Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Light, or Super Game Boy (and its Japanese-only follow-up), the game would not run, and an image on the screen would inform the user that the game is only compatible with Game Boy Color systems. One exception would be the [[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]] game: despite the game cartridge featuring a notch, enabling it to be inserted on the original Game Boy, the game displays an error message indicating that it only plays on Game Boy Color.

Notches were located at the base of the cartridge's two back corners. One of these notches was placed as to avoid pressing a switch inside the cartridge slot. When an older Game Boy or Game Boy Color game was inserted into the cartridge slot, the switch would be pressed down and the Game Boy Advance would start in Game Boy Color mode, while a Game Boy Advance cartridge would not touch the switch and the system would start in Game Boy Advance mode. The Nintendo DS replaced the switch with a solid piece of plastic that would allow Game Boy Advance cartridges to be inserted into Slot 2, but would prevent an older Game Boy or Game Boy Color cartridge from being inserted fully into the slot.\n\nExcluding game-specific variations, there are four types of cartridges compatible with Game Boy systems:\n[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Cartridge.jpg|120px|thumb|right|The original grey Game Boy Game Pak]]\n* '''Grey cartridges''' (Also known as class A) are compatible with all Game Boy systems, excluding Game Boy Micro. All original Game Boy games are of this type. Some of these cartridges are in alternative colors, such as red or blue for [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'']], and yellow for the ''[[Donkey Kong Land]]'' series. The games on these cartridges are programmed in black and white; the Game Boy Color and later systems provide [[Game Boy Color#Color palettes used for original Game Boy games|selectable color palettes]] for them. Some grey cartridges that were released between 1994 and 1998 have [[Super Game Boy]] enhancements. Even fewer grey cartridges were released with built-in features that made them protrude from the slot, but included the notch to be compatible with the original Game Boy (notably the ''[[Game Boy Camera]]'')\n[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Cartridge-Black.jpg|120px|thumb|right|The black Game Boy Game Pak]]\n* '''Black cartridges''' (Also known as class B or Dual Mode) are compatible with all Game Boy systems, excluding Game Boy Micro. Although the games on these cartridges are programmed in color, they can still be played in monochrome on Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Light and Super Game Boy (and its Japanese follow-up). Examples of black-cartridge games are ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition]]'', [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] (however, the actual colors of these three cartridges are yellow, gold, and silver, respectively). Games such as ''[[Wario Land II]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening|The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX]]'' were full-color re-releases of gray-cartridge games but with additional content only available on the Game Boy Color.

Some cartridges are colored to resemble the game (usually for the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' series; ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald]]'', for example, being a clear emerald green). They are also compatible with Nintendo DS and DS Lite (but see the [[#Reception|Reception]] section for limitations). Some Advance cartridges have built-in features, including rumble features (''[[Drill Dozer]]''), tilt sensors (''[[WarioWare: Twisted!]]'', ''[[Yoshi's Universal Gravitation]]'') and [[Photodiode|solar sensors]] (''[[Boktai]]'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n== Accessories ==\n{{Main|Game Boy accessories}}\n{{multiple image\n|footer    =\n|align     = right\n|image1    = Game-Boy-Camera.jpg\n|width1    = {{#expr: (200 * 1150 / 2150) round 0}}\n|alt1      = Game Boy Camera\n|caption1  = Game Boy Camera\n|image2    = Game Boy Printer.jpg\n|width2    = {{#expr: (200 * 2515 / 3473) round 0}}\n|alt2      = Game Boy Printer\n|caption2  = Game Boy Printer\n}}\n\n{{expand section|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe Game Boy, as with many other consoles, has had a number of releases from both first-party and unlicensed third-party accessories. The most notable being the [[Game Boy Camera]] (left) and the [[Game Boy Printer]] (right), which were released in 1998.\n\n=== Television adapters ===\nIn addition to the Game Boy, special hardware has been released for various handhelds in the Game Boy line so they can be played on a television set.\n\n==== Super Game Boy ====\n[[File:Nintendo-Super-Game-Boy.jpg|thumb|right|150px| The North American Super Game Boy]]\nIn 1994, a special adapter cartridge for Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) was released called the [[Super Game Boy]]. The Super Game Boy allows game cartridges designed for use on the Game Boy to be played on a TV display using the SNES/Super Famicom controllers. When it was released in 1994, the Super Game Boy sold for about $60 in the United States. In the United Kingdom, it retailed for \u00a349.99. The Super Game Boy's technical architecture is similar to that of a regular Game Boy, thus Game Boy games functioned on the native hardware rather than being emulated by the SNES. It was the precursor to the Game Boy Player on the Nintendo GameCube, which functioned in a similar manner.\n\n==== Super Game Boy 2 ====\nA follow-up of the [[Super Game Boy]], the Super Game Boy 2 was released only in Japan in 1998. The border is similar to that of actual Game Boy Pocket hardware, but it includes actual link cable port, and the clock speed is slowed down to match that of the Game Boy.\n\n==== Game Boy Player ====\nThe [[Game Boy Player]] is a device released in 2003 by Nintendo for the GameCube which enables Game Boy (although Super Game Boy enhancements are ignored), Game Boy Color, or Game Boy Advance cartridges to be played on a television. It connects via the high speed parallel port at the bottom of the GameCube and requires use of a boot disc to access the hardware. Unlike devices such as Datel's Advance Game Port, the Game Boy Player does not use software emulation, but instead uses physical hardware nearly identical to that of a Game Boy Advance.\n\n== Reception ==\nApproximately two thousand games are available for the Game Boy, which can be attributed in part to its sales in the amount of millions, a well-documented design, and a typically short development cycle.\nThe [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Nintendo DS Lite]] are able to play the large library of Game Boy Advance games (though the [[Nintendo DSi]], [[#Larger model|Nintendo DSi XL]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], and [[Nintendo 2DS]] lack a GBA game cartridge slot). However, the DS consoles do not have a GBA game link connector, and so cannot play multiplayer GBA games (except for the few that are multiplayer on a single GBA) or link to the [[GameCube]]. The DS is not backward-compatible with Game Paks for the original Game Boy or the Game Boy Color. With homebrew development on the Nintendo DS, full speed Game Boy and Game Boy Color emulation has been achieved as well as the ability to scale the smaller Game Boy screen image to the full DS screen.\n\n=== Legacy ===\n{{See also|Chiptune|Nintendo}}\n{{expand section|date=December 2013}}\nNumerous musical acts have appropriated the Game Boy as a musical instrument ([[Game Boy music]]), using software such as [[nanoloop]] or [[Little Sound DJ]].\n\nCertain games released for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color handheld consoles are available via the [[Virtual Console]] service on the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. Game Boy Advance games were thought to be as well due to the 3DS not being compatible, but it was just a mistranslation. However, ten Game Boy Advance games were released for Nintendo 3DS ambassadors, as in Nintendo 3DS owners who logged into the 3DS eShop before the major August 2011 price drop. The Virtual Console GBA features of releases are limited, and there are no plans to release them to the public. However, starting from April 2014, Nintendo has been releasing Game Boy Advance games as Virtual Console titles via the Nintendo eShop for the [[Wii U]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons|Game Boy and variants}}\n* [[Pok\u00e9mon Mini]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

After docking with their [[Agena target vehicle|Agena]] booster in low orbit, Young and Collins used it to climb temporarily to {{convert|763.8|km|nmi|disp=flip}}. After leaving the first Agena, they then met with the dead, drifting Agena left over from the aborted [[Gemini 8]] flight\u2014thus executing the program's first double rendezvous. With no electricity on board the second Agena, the rendezvous was accomplished with eyes only\u2014no radar. After the rendezvous, Collins spacewalked over to the dormant Agena at the end of a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} tether, making Collins the first person to meet another spacecraft in orbit. He retrieved a cosmic dust-collecting panel from the side of the Agena, but was not able to take any pictures; in the complicated business of keeping his tether clear of the Gemini and Agena, his Hasselblad camera worked itself free and drifted away.\n\nGemini 10 was designed to achieve the objectives planned for the last two missions\u2014[[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]], docking and [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]. As well as this it was also hoped to dock with the [[Agena Target Vehicle]] from the Gemini 8 mission.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1966-066A|title=Gemini 10|publisher=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=January 6, 2018}}</ref> This Agena's battery power had failed many months earlier and this would demonstrate the ability to rendezvous with a passive object. It would be also the first mission to fire the Agena's own rocket, allowing them to reach higher orbits.\n\n==Flight==\nThe Agena launched perfectly for the second time, after problems had occurred with the targets for Gemini 6 and 9. Gemini 10 followed 100 minutes later and entered a {{convert|159.9|by|268.9|km|nmi|adj=on|sp=us|disp=flip}} orbit. They were {{convert|1800|km|nmi|sp=us|disp=flip}} behind the Agena. Two anomalous events occurred during the launch. At liftoff, a propellant fill umbilical became snared with its release lanyard. It ripped out of the LC-19 service tower and remained attached to the second stage during ascent. Tracking camera footage also showed that the first stage oxidizer tank dome ruptured after staging and released a cloud of [[nitrogen tetroxide]]. The telemetry package on the first stage had been disabled at staging, so visual evidence was the only data available. Film review of Titan II ICBM launches found at least seven other instances of post-staging tank rupture, most likely caused by flying debris, second stage engine exhaust, or structural bending. NASA finally decided that this phenomenon did not pose any safety risk to the astronauts and no corrective action had to be taken.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Gemini 10\n! scope=\"col\" | Agena Info\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Agena\n| GATV-5005\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | NSSDC ID:\n| 1966-065A\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mass\n| {{convert|3,175|kg|lb|disp=flip}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Launch site\n| LC-14\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Launch date\n| July 18, 1966\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Launch time\n| 20:39:46 UTC\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st perigee\n| {{convert|294.7|km|nmi|disp=flip}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st apogee\n| {{convert|302.8|km|nmi|disp=flip}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Period\n| 90.46 m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inclination\n| 28.85\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Reentered\n| December 29, 1966\n|}\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===First rendezvous===\nCollins discovered that he was unable to use the sextant for navigation as it did not seem to work as expected. At first he mistook airglow as the real horizon when trying to make some fixes on stars. Then the image didn't seem right. He tried another instrument that they had on board but this was not practical to use as it had a very small field of view.\n\nThey had a backup in the form of the computers on the ground. They made their first burn to put them into a {{convert|265|by|272|km|nmi|adj=on|sp=us|disp=flip}} orbit. However Young didn't realize that during the next burn, he had the spacecraft turned slightly, which meant that they introduced an out-of-plane error. This meant two extra burns were necessary, and by the time they had docked with the Agena, 60% of their fuel had been consumed. It was decided to keep the Gemini docked to the Agena as long as possible, as this would mean that they could use the fuel on board the Agena for attitude control.\n\nThe first burn of the Agena engine lasted 80 seconds and put them in a {{convert|294|by|763|km|nmi|adj=on|sp=us|disp=flip}} orbit. This was the highest a person had ever been, although the record was soon surpassed by [[Gemini 11]], which went to over {{convert|1000|km|nmi|sp=us|disp=flip}}. This burn was quite a ride for the crew. Because the Gemini and Agena docked nose-to-nose, the forces experienced were \"eyeballs out\" as opposed to \"eyeballs in\" for a launch from Earth. The crew took a couple of pictures when they reached [[apogee]] but were more interested in what was going on in the spacecraft &mdash; checking the systems and watching the radiation dosage meter.\n\nAfter this they had their sleep period which lasted for eight hours and then they were ready for another busy day. The crew's first order of business was to make a second burn with the Agena engine to put them into the same orbit as the Gemini 8 Agena. This was at 20:58 UTC on July 19 and lasted 78 seconds and took {{convert|105|m/s|ft/s|sp=us|disp=flip}} off their speed, putting them into a {{convert|294|by|382|km|nmi|adj=on|sp=us|disp=flip}} orbit. They made one more burn of the Agena to circularize their orbit to {{convert|377.6|km|nmi|sp=us|disp=flip}}.\n\n===EVA 1===\nIt was now time for the first of two EVAs on Gemini 10. This was to be just a standup EVA, where Collins would stand in the open hatch and take some photographs of stars as part of experiment S-13. They used a 70&nbsp;mm general purpose camera to image the southern [[Milky Way Galaxy|Milky Way]] in ultraviolet. After orbital sunrise, Collins then photographed a color plate on the side of the spacecraft (MSC-8) to see whether film reproduced colors accurately in space. They reentered the spacecraft six minutes early when they both found their eyes were irritated, which was caused by a minor leak of [[lithium hydroxide]] in the astronauts' oxygen supply.<ref name=collins>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Michael|title=Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys|date=1974|publisher=Cooper Square Press|isbn=9781461660880|type=ebook|chapter=8}}</ref>  After repressurizing the cabin, they ran the oxygen at high rates and flushed the environment system.\n\nAfter the exercise of the EVA Young and Collins slept in their second 'night' in space. The next 'morning' they started preparing for the second rendezvous and another EVA.\n\n===Second rendezvous===\nAfter undocking from their Agena, the crew thought they sighted the Gemini 8 Agena. It however turned out to be their own Agena {{convert|5.5|km|nmi|sp=us|disp=flip}} away, while their target was {{convert|176|km|nmi|sp=us|disp=flip}} away. It wasn't until just over {{convert|30|km|nmi|disp=flip}} away that they saw it as a faint star. After a few more correction burns, they were station-keeping {{convert|10|ft|m|sp=us}} away from the Gemini 8 Agena. They found the Agena to be very stable and in good condition.\n\n===EVA 2===\nAt 48 hours and 41 minutes into the mission, the second EVA began. Collins' first task was to retrieve a Micrometeorite Collector (S-12) from the side of the spacecraft. This he accomplished with some difficulty (similar to that encountered by [[Eugene Cernan]] on [[Gemini 9A]]). However, the collector floated out of the cabin some time later during the EVA and was lost.\n\nHe next traveled over to the Agena and tried to grab onto the docking cone but found this impossible as it was smooth and had no grip. Collins used a [[nitrogen]]-propelled [[Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit]] (HHMU) to move himself towards the Gemini and then back to the Agena. This time he was able to grab hold of some wire bundles and retrieved the Micrometeorite Collector (S-10) from the Agena. He decided against replacing it as he could lose the one he had just retrieved.\n\nHis last task on this EVA was to test out the HHMU. However this stopped working and meant they finished the EVA after only 39 minutes. During this time, it took the crew eight minutes to close the hatch as they had some difficulty with the {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} umbilical. It was jettisoned along with the chestpack used by Collins an hour later when they opened the hatch for the third and final time.\n\n===Experiments===\nThere were ten other experiments that the crew performed during the mission. Three were interested in radiation: MSC-3 was the Tri-Axis Magnetometer which measured levels in the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]]. There was also MSC-6, a [[Beta particle|beta]] [[spectrometer]], which measured potential radiation doses for Apollo missions, and MSC-7, a [[bremsstrahlung]] spectrometer which detected [[radiation flux]] as a function of energy when the spacecraft passed through the South Atlantic Anomaly.\n\nS-26 investigated the ion and electron wake of the spacecraft. This provided limited results due to the lack of fuel for attitude control, but found that electron and ion temperatures were higher than expected and it registered shock effects during docking and undocking.\n\nThe S-5 and S-6 experiments were performed, which were previously carried on Gemini 9A; these were Synoptic Terrain and Synoptic Weather photography respectively. There was also S-1 which was intended to image the [[Zodiacal light]]. All of these experiments were of little use as the film used was only half as sensitive as Gemini 9A and the dirty windows lowered the transmission of light by a factor of six.\n\nThe crew also tried to perform D-5, a navigation experiment. They were only able to track five stars, with six needed for accurate measurements. The last experiment, D-10, was to investigate an ion-sensing attitude control system. This experiment measured the attitude of the spacecraft from the flow of ions and electrons around the spacecraft in orbit. The results from this experiment showed the system to be accurate and responsive.\n\n===Re-entry===\n[[File:Gemini 10 Splashdown - GPN-2000-000995.jpg|thumb|left|Splashdown of Gemini 10.]]\n\nThe last day of the mission was short and retrofire came at 70 hours and 10 minutes into the mission. They landed only {{convert|5.6|km|nmi|sp=us|disp=flip}} away from the intended landing site and were recovered by {{USS|Guadalcanal|LPH-7|6}}.\n\nThe Gemini 10 mission was supported by the following U.S. Department of Defense resources; 9,067 personnel, 78 aircraft and 13 ships.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Insignia==\n[[File:Gemini 10 Flown Fliteline Gold-Colored Medallion.jpg|thumb|Gemini 10 space-flown [[NASA space-flown Robbins medallions of the Apollo missions#Gemini mission space-flown Fliteline medallions|Fliteline Medallion]]]]\nThe patch is simple in design but highly symbolic.

In gardens, [[ornamental plant]]s are often grown for their [[flower]]s, [[leaf|foliage]], or overall appearance; useful plants, such as [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]], [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, and [[herb]]s, are grown for consumption, for use as [[dye]]s, or for [[Medicine|medicinal]] or [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] use. Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.\n\nGardening ranges in scale from [[fruit]] [[orchard]]s, to long [[boulevard]] plantings with one or more different types of [[shrub]]s, [[tree]]s, and [[herbaceous plant]]s, to residential [[Yard (land)|yards]] including lawns and foundation plantings, to plants in large or small containers grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a large number of different plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from [[Agriculture|farming]] or [[forestry]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of gardening}}\n[[Image:Forestgarden2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Robert Hart (horticulturist)|Robert Hart]]'s forest garden in [[Shropshire]], England]]\n\n===Ancient times===\n[[Forest gardening]], a forest-based food production system, is the world's oldest form of gardening.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=2003|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA1#v=onepage|isbn=9780754609582}}</ref> Forest gardens originated in [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]] along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of [[monsoon]] regions. In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved while undesirable species were eliminated. Eventually foreign species were also selected and incorporated into the gardens.<ref>{{cite book|title=The forest-garden farms of Kandy, Sri Lanka|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=1992|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3QPo7lThXsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA1#v=onepage|isbn=9789251028988}}</ref>\n\nAfter the emergence of the first [[civilization]]s, wealthy individuals began to create gardens for aesthetic purposes. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian tomb paintings from the [[New Kingdom]] (around 1500 BC) provide some of the earliest physical evidence of ornamental [[horticulture]] and landscape design; they depict [[Egyptian lotus|lotus]] ponds surrounded by symmetrical rows of [[acacia]]s and [[palm tree|palms]]. A notable example of ancient [[Ornamental Gardens|ornamental gardens]] were the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]]\u2014one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] \u2014while [[ancient Rome]] had dozens of gardens.\n\nWealthy ancient Egyptians used gardens for providing shade. Egyptians associated trees and gardens with gods, believing that their deities were pleased by gardens. Gardens in ancient Egypt were often surrounded by walls with trees planted in rows. Among the most popular species planted were [[date palms]], sycamores, [[Ficus|fir trees]], nut trees, and [[willows]]. These gardens were a sign of higher socioeconomic status. In addition, wealthy ancient Egyptians grew vineyards, as wine was a sign of the higher social classes. [[Rose]]s, poppies, [[Asteraceae|daisies]] and [[Iris (plant)|irises]] could all also be found in the gardens of the Egyptians.\n\n[[Assyria]] was also renowned for its beautiful gardens. These tended to be wide and large, some of them used for hunting game\u2014rather like a game reserve today\u2014and others as leisure gardens. [[Cupressus|Cypresses]] and palms were some of the most frequently planted types of trees.\n\n[[Ancient Roman]] gardens were laid out with hedges and vines and contained a wide variety of flowers\u2014[[Acanthus (plant)|acanthus]], [[cornflowers]], [[crocus]], [[cyclamen]], hyacinth, iris, ivy, [[lavender]], lilies, myrtle, narcissus, poppy, [[rosemary]] and violets<ref name=\"localhistories\">{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/gardening.html| title=A Brief History of Gardening|accessdate= 2010-06-04}}</ref>\u2014as well as statues and sculptures. Flower beds were popular in the courtyards of rich Romans.\n[[File:Mendel II 073 v.jpg|thumb|170px|A gardener at work, 1607]]\n\n===The Middle Ages===\nThe [[Middle Age]] represented a period of decline in gardens for aesthetic purposes, with regard to gardening. After the fall of Rome, gardening was done for the purpose of growing [[medicinal herbs]] and/or decorating church [[altars]]. Monasteries carried on a tradition of garden design and intense horticultural techniques during the medieval period in Europe. \nGenerally, monastic garden types consisted of kitchen gardens, infirmary gardens, cemetery orchards, cloister garths and vineyards. Individual monasteries might also have had a \"green court\", a plot of grass and trees where horses could graze, as well as a cellarer's garden or private gardens for obedientiaries, monks who held specific posts within the monastery.\n\n[[Islamic Gardens|Islamic gardens]] were built after the model of Persian gardens and they were usually enclosed by walls and divided in 4 by watercourses. Commonly, the center of the garden would have a pool or [[pavilion]]. Specific to the Islamic gardens are the [[mosaics]] and glazed tiles used to decorate the rills and [[fountains]] that were built in these gardens.\n\nBy the late 13th century, rich Europeans began to grow gardens for leisure and for medicinal herbs and vegetables.<ref name=\"localhistories\" /> They surrounded the gardens by walls to protect them from animals and to provide [[seclusion]]. During the next two centuries, Europeans started planting lawns and raising flowerbeds and trellises of roses. Fruit trees were common in these gardens and also in some, there were turf seats. At the same time, the gardens in the [[monasteries]] were a place to grow flowers and medicinal herbs but they were also a space where the [[monks]] could enjoy nature and relax.\n\nThe gardens in the 16th and 17th century were [[symmetric]], proportioned and balanced with a more classical appearance. Most of these gardens were built around a central axis and they were divided into different parts by hedges. Commonly, gardens had flowerbeds laid out in squares and separated by gravel paths.\n\nGardens in Renaissance were adorned with sculptures, topiary and fountains. In the 17th century, knot gardens became popular along with the hedge mazes. By this time, Europeans started planting new flowers such as [[tulips]], marigolds and [[sunflowers]].\n\n===Cottage gardens===\n[[Cottage garden]]s, which emerged in Elizabethan times, appear to have originated as a local source for herbs and fruits.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryrie|first=Charlie|title=The Cottage Garden: How to Plan and Plant a Garden That Grows Itself|publisher=[[Collins & Brown]]|year=2004|page=7|isbn=1-84340-216-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VfO_WIAx0wC&pg=PA7}}</ref> One theory is that they arose out of the [[Black Death]] of the 1340s, when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages with personal gardens.<ref name=\"Scott-James80\">{{cite book|last=Scott-James|first=Anne|author2=Osbert Lancaster|title=The Pleasure Garden: An Illustrated History of British Gardening|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|year=2004|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbhwIo3m3mQC&pg=PA80|isbn=978-0-7112-2360-8}}</ref> According to the late 19th-century legend of origin,<ref>[[Anne Scott-James]], ''The Cottage Garden'' (London: Lane) 1981, de-mythologised the origins of the English cottage garden, and its treasured [[topiary]] among the vegetables and flowers, popularly supposed to represent heirlooms from the seventeenth century.</ref> these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages, to provide them with food and herbs, with flowers planted among them for decoration. Farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a small garden\u2014about {{convert|1|acre}}\u2014where they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens.<ref>''A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600\u20131840'', Howard Colvin, [[Yale University Press]], 2008\n{{ISBN|0-300-12508-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CSyaO-MqYoAC&pg=PA659 p 659]</ref>\n\nAuthentic gardens of the [[Yeoman|yeoman cottager]] would have included a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, along with a well. The peasant cottager of medieval times was more interested in meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use\u2014violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); [[calendula]]s and [[primula vulgaris|primroses]] were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as [[sweet william]] and [[hollyhock]]s, were grown entirely for their beauty.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Christopher|author2=Richard Bird|others=Jacqui Hurst|title=The Cottage Garden|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=1999|pages=6\u20139|isbn=978-0-7513-0702-3}}</ref>\n\n===18th century===\nIn the 18th century, gardens were laid out more naturally, without any walls. This style of smooth undulating grass, which would run straight to the house, clumps, belts and scattering of trees and his serpentine lakes formed by invisibly damming small rivers, were a new style within the English landscape, a \"gardenless\" form of landscape gardening, which swept away almost all the remnants of previous formally patterned styles. The English garden usually included a lake, lawns set against groves of trees, and often contained shrubberies, grottoes, pavilions, bridges and [[folly|follies]] such as mock temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. This new style emerged in [[England]] in the early 18th century, and spread across [[Europe]], replacing the more formal, symmetrical [[Garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]] of the 17th century as the principal gardening style of Europe.<ref>Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe'', Citadelles and Mazenod, Paris, 2006.</ref> The English garden presented an idealized view of nature. They were often inspired by paintings of landscapes by [[Claude Lorraine]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]], and some were Influenced by the classic [[Chinese gardens]] of the East,<ref name=Boults/> which had recently been described by European travelers.<ref name=Boults>{{cite book|title=Illustrated History of Landscape Design|author=Boults, Elizabeth and Chip Sullivan|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2010|isbn=0-470-28933-3|page=175}}</ref>  The work of [[Capability Brown|Lancelot 'Capability' Brown]] was particularly influential.   Also, in 1804 the Horticultural Society was formed. Gardens of the 19th century contained plants such as the monkey puzzle or Chile pine. This is also the time when the so-called \"gardenesque\" style of gardens evolved. These gardens displayed a wide variety of flowers in a rather small space. [[Rock garden]]s increased in popularity in the 19th century.\n\n==Types==\n{{main|List of garden types}}\n[[File:SF Conservatory of Flowers 3.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Conservatory of Flowers in [[Golden Gate Park]], [[San Francisco]]]]\n[[File:Hanging baskets in thornbury arp.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Hanging basket]]s in [[Thornbury, South Gloucestershire]]]]\n[[Garden design|Residential gardening]] takes place near the home, in a space referred to as the '''garden'''. Although a garden typically is located on the land near a residence, it may also be located [[roof garden|on a roof]], in an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], on a [[balcony]], in a [[windowbox]], or [[Patio|on a patio]] or [[vivarium]].\n\nGardening also takes place in non-residential green areas, such as parks, public or semi-public gardens ([[botanical garden]]s or [[zoo|zoological gardens]]), [[amusement park]]s, along transportation corridors, and around [[tourism|tourist attractions]] and [[garden hotels]]. In these situations, a staff of gardeners or [[groundskeeper]]s maintains the gardens.\n* [[Garden|Indoor gardening]] is concerned with the growing of [[houseplant]]s within a residence or building, in a [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]], or in a [[greenhouse]]. Indoor gardens are sometimes incorporated as part of [[air conditioning]] or heating systems. Indoor gardening extends the growing season in the fall and spring and can be used for [[winter gardening]].\n* [[Native plant gardening]] is concerned with the use of [[native plants]] with or without the intent of creating [[wildlife habitat]]. The goal is to create a garden in harmony with, and adapted to a given area. This type of gardening typically reduces water usage, maintenance, and fertilization costs, while increasing [[native fauna]]l interest.\n* [[Water garden]]ing is concerned with growing plants adapted to pools and ponds. [[Bog]] gardens are also considered a type of water garden. These all require special conditions and considerations. A simple water garden may consist solely of a tub containing the water and plant(s). In [[aquascaping]], a garden is created within an [[aquarium]] tank.\n* [[Container garden]]ing is concerned with growing plants in any type of container either indoors or outdoors. Common containers are pots, [[hanging basket]]s, and planters. Container gardening is usually used in atriums and on balconies, patios, and roof tops.\n* [[Compost#H\u00fcgelkultur|H\u00fcgelkultur]] is concerned with growing plants on piles of rotting wood, as a form of [[raised bed gardening]] and composting [[In situ#Biology|in situ]].<ref name=\"richsoil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/|title=hugelkultur: the ultimate raised garden beds|website=www.richsoil.com}}</ref> An English [[loanword]] from German, it means \"mound garden.\" [[Toby Hemenway]], noted [[Permaculture]] author and teacher, considers wood buried in trenches to also be a form of hugelkultur referred to as a dead wood [[Swale (landform)|swale]].<ref>Hemenway, Toby (2009).

These shared gardens, typically front or back [[yard (land)|yards]], are usually used to produce food that is divided between the two parties.\n* [[Organic horticulture|Organic gardening]] uses natural, sustainable methods, fertilizers and pesticides to grow non-[[genetically modified crops]].\n\n==Garden features and accessories==\nThere is a wide range of features and accessories available in the market for both the professional gardener and the amateur to exercise their creativity. These are used to add decoration or functionality, and may be made from a wide range of materials such as copper, stone, wood, bamboo, [[stainless steel]], [[clay]], [[stained glass]], concrete, or iron. Examples include [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]], [[arbor (garden)|arbor]]s, statues, [[Bench (furniture)|benches]], [[water fountains]], [[urns]], bird baths and feeders, and garden lighting such as candle [[lanterns]] and [[oil lamps]]. The use of these items can be part of the expression of a gardener's gardening personality.\n\n==Comparison with farming==\n[[File:Jardinage petits outils.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.8|Hand gardening tools]]\n\nGardening for beauty is likely{{original research inline|date=January 2018}} nearly as old as farming for food, however for most of history for the majority of people there was no real distinction since the need for food and other useful products trumped other concerns. Small-scale, [[subsistence agriculture]] (called [[hoe-farming]]) is largely indistinguishable from gardening. A patch of potatoes grown by a Peruvian peasant or an Irish smallholder for personal use could be described as either a garden or a farm. Gardening for average people evolved as a separate discipline, more concerned with aesthetics, [[recreation]] and [[leisure]],<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Mickey\n| first1 = Thomas J.\n| orig-year = 2003\n| title = Deconstructing Public Relations: Public Relations Criticism\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wxaQAgAAQBAJ\n| series = Routledge Communication Series\n| location = Mahwah, New Jersey\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2008\n| page = 43\n| isbn = 9781135652210\n| access-date = 2018-01-21\n| quote = The number-one leisure activity in the United States is gardening.\n}}\n</ref>\nunder the influence of the pleasure gardens of the wealthy.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  Meanwhile, farming has evolved (in developed countries) in the direction of [[commercial agriculture|commercialization]], [[economics of scale]], and [[monocropping]].\n\nIn respect to its food-producing purpose, gardening is distinguished{{by whom|date=January 2018}} from [[Agriculture|farming]] chiefly by scale and intent. Farming occurs on a larger scale, and with the production of salable goods as a major motivation. Gardening happens on a smaller scale, primarily for pleasure and to produce goods for the gardener's own family or community. There is some overlap between the terms, particularly in that some moderate-sized vegetable growing concerns, often called [[market gardening]], can fit in either category.\n[[File:Brian Farrell plants.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Planting in a garden]]\nThe key distinction between gardening and farming is essentially one of scale; gardening can be a hobby or an income supplement, but farming is generally understood{{by whom|date=January 2018}} as a full-time or commercial activity, usually involving more land and quite different practices. One distinction is that gardening is labor-intensive and employs very little [[infrastructural capital]], sometimes no more than a few tools, e.g. a [[spade]], [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]], [[basket]] and [[watering can]]. By contrast, larger-scale farming often involves [[irrigation|irrigation systems]], chemical [[fertilizer]]s and [[combine harvester|harvesters]] or at least [[ladder]]s, e.g. to reach up into [[fruit tree]]s. However, this distinction is becoming blurred with the increasing use of power tools in even small gardens.\n\nIn part because of labor intensity and aesthetic motivations, gardening is very often much more productive per unit of land than farming.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In the [[Soviet Union]], half the [[food security|food supply]] came from small peasants' garden plots on the huge government-run [[collective farming|collective farms]], although they were tiny patches of land.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Some{{Who|date=October 2015}} argue this as evidence of the superiority of [[capitalism]], since the [[kolkhoznik|peasant]]s could generally sell their produce. Others{{Who|date=October 2015}} consider it to be evidence of a [[tragedy of the commons]], since the large collective plots were often{{quantify|date=January 2018}} neglected, with fertilizers or water redirected to the private gardens.\n\n[[Monty Don]] has speculated on an atavistic connection between present-day gardeners and pre-modern [[peasantry]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Swift\n| first1 = Joe\n| author-link1 = Joe Swift\n| chapter = Summer at the plot\n| title = Joe's Allotment: Planning and planting a productive plot\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6c3UyYKo1EEC\n| publisher = Random House\n| publication-date = 2012\n| isbn = 9781409070139\n| access-date = 2018-01-20\n| quote = I suppose it is an atavistic connection with the land and the completely honourable peasant mentality, that was lost in Britain with the Industrial Revolution, yet persists in our gardens and allotments.\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe term [[precision agriculture]] is sometimes used{{by whom|date=January 2018}} to describe gardening using [[Appropriate technology|intermediate technology]] (more than tools, less than harvesters), especially of [[organic farming|organic varieties]]. Gardening is effectively scaled up to feed entire villages of over 100 people from specialized plots. A variant is the [[community gardening|community garden]] which offers plots to urban dwellers; see further in [[allotment (gardening)]].\n\n==Gardens as art==\n{{See also|Landscape architecture}}\n[[File:Schultenhof Mettingen Bauerngarten 8.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Garden at the Schultenhof in [[Mettingen]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany]]\n[[Garden design]] is considered to be an art in most cultures, distinguished from gardening, which generally means ''garden maintenance''. Garden design can include different themes such as perennial, butterfly, wildlife, Japanese, water, [[Tropical garden|tropical]], or shade gardens. In Japan, [[Samurai]] and [[Zen|Zen monks]] were often required to build decorative gardens or practice related skills like [[floristry|flower arrangement]] known as ''[[ikebana]]''. In 18th-century Europe, country estates were refashioned by landscape gardeners into [[Garden design|formal gardens]] or landscaped park lands, such as at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], France, or [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire|Stowe]], England. Today, [[landscape architect]]s and [[garden designer]]s continue to produce artistically creative designs for private garden spaces. In the US, professional landscape designers are certified by the Association of Professional Landscape Designers.<ref>[http://www.apld.org APLD.org]</ref>\n\n==Social aspects==\nPeople can express their political or social views in gardens, intentionally or not. The lawn vs. garden issue is played out in [[urban planning]] as the debate over the \"[[land ethic]]\" that is to determine urban [[land use]] and whether hyper [[hygiene|hygienist]] [[bylaw]]s (e.g. [[weed control]]) should apply, or whether land should generally be allowed to exist in its natural wild state. In a famous [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights]] case, \"Sandra Bell vs. City of Toronto\", 1997, the right to cultivate all native species, even most varieties deemed noxious or allergenic, was upheld as part of the [[Freedom of speech|right of free expression]].\n\n[[Community gardening]] comprises a wide variety of approaches to sharing land and gardens.\n\nPeople often surround their house and garden with a hedge. Common hedge plants are [[privet]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]], [[beech]], [[Taxus|yew]], [[Leyland Cypress|leyland cypress]], [[Tsuga|hemlock]], [[Thuja occidentalis|arborvitae]], [[Berberis|barberry]], [[Buxus|box]], [[holly]], [[Nerium oleander|oleander]], [[forsythia]] and [[lavender]]. The idea of open gardens without hedges may be distasteful to those who enjoy privacy.\nThe [[Slow Food]] movement has sought in some countries to add an edible school yard and garden classrooms to schools, e.g. in [[Fergus, Ontario]], where these were added to a public school to augment the kitchen classroom. [[Garden sharing]], where urban landowners allow gardeners to grow on their property in exchange for a share of the harvest, is associated with the desire to control the quality of one's food, and reconnect with soil and community.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/04/ethicalliving.organics Meet the urban sharecroppers] ''The Guardian'', 4 September 2008</ref>\n\nIn US and British usage, the production of ornamental plantings around buildings is called ''[[landscaping]]'', ''[[landscape maintenance]]'' or ''grounds keeping'', while international usage uses the term ''gardening'' for these same activities.\n\nAlso gaining popularity is the concept of \"Green Gardening\" which involves growing plants using organic fertilizers and pesticides so that the gardening process - or the flowers and fruits produced thereby - doesn't adversely affect the environment or people's health in any manner.\n\n==Garden pests==\nGarden pests are generally [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], or [[animal]]s (frequently [[insect]]s) that engage in activity that the gardener considers undesirable. A pest may crowd out desirable plants, disturb soil, stunt the growth of young seedlings, steal or damage fruit, or otherwise kill plants, hamper their growth, damage their appearance, or reduce the quality of the edible or ornamental portions of the plant. [[Aphid]]s, [[spider mite]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[ant]]s, [[bird]]s, and even [[cat]]s are commonly considered to be garden pests.\n\nBecause gardeners may have different goals, organisms considered \"garden pests\" vary from gardener to gardener. ''[[Tropaeolum speciosum]]'', for example, may be considered a desirable and ornamental garden plant, or it may be considered a pest if it [[seed]]s and starts to grow where it is not wanted. As another example, in [[lawn]]s, moss can become dominant and be impossible to eradicate. In some lawns, [[lichen]]s, especially very damp lawn lichens such as ''[[Peltigera]] lactucfolia'' and ''P. membranacea'', can become difficult to control and be considered pests.\n\n===Garden pest control===\nThere are many ways by which unwanted pests are removed from a garden. The techniques vary depending on the pest, the gardener's goals, and the gardener's philosophy. For example, snails may be dealt with through the use of a chemical pesticide, an organic pesticide, hand-picking, barriers, or simply growing snail-resistant plants.\n\nPest control is often done through the use of [[pesticides]], which may be either [[Organic agriculture|organic]] or artificially synthesized. Pesticides may affect the [[ecology]] of a garden due to their effects on the populations of both target and non-target species. For example, unintended exposure to some [[neonicotinoid]] pesticides has been proposed as a factor in the recent decline in [[honey bee]] populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/03/28/science.1215039| title=A Common Pesticide Decreases Foraging Success and Survival in Honey Bees|accessdate= 2012-03-29}}</ref> A mole vibrator can deter mole activity in a garden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/1998/04/mole-ested?page=0,2| title=Mole-ested|accessdate= 2014-05-28}}</ref>\n\nOther means of control include the removal of infected plants, using fertilizers and biostimulants to improve the health and vigour of plants so they better resist attack, practising [[crop rotation]] to prevent pest build-up, using [[companion planting]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/2010/08/11/episode-24-companion-planting-and-crop-rotation/ |title=The Self-Sufficient Gardener Podcast--Episode 24 Companion Planting and Crop Rotation |accessdate=2010-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918114758/http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/2010/08/11/episode-24-companion-planting-and-crop-rotation/ |archivedate=18 September 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> and practising good garden hygiene, such as disinfecting tools and clearing debris and [[weed]]s which may harbour pests.\n\n===Garden Guns===\n{{main|Garden guns}}\n[[File:.22LR ratshot.jpg|thumb|right|CCI .22LR snake shot loaded with #12 shot]]\n\n\"[[Garden guns|Garden Guns]]\" are smooth bore shotguns specifically made to fire [[.22 caliber]] [[snake shot]], and are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for [[pest control]]. Garden Guns are short range weapons that can do little harm past {{convert|15|yard}} to {{convert|20|yard}}, and they're relatively quiet when fired with snake shot, compared to a standard ammunition. These guns are especially effective inside of barns and sheds, as the snake shot will not shoot holes in the roof or walls, or more importantly injure [[livestock]] with a [[ricochet]]. They are also used for pest control at [[airport]]s, [[warehouse]]s, [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], etc.<ref name=\"Eger\">{{cite web|last1=Eger|first1=Christopher|title=Marlin 25MG Garden Gun|url=http://www.marlinforum.com/Marlin-25MG-Garden-Gun.html|website=Marlin Firearms Forum|publisher=Outdoor Hub LLC|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=28 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918005923/http://www.marlinforum.com/Marlin-25MG-Garden-Gun.html|archive-date=18 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Gardening|Agriculture}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Arboretum]]\n* [[Bonsai]]\n* [[Compost]]\n* [[Cottage garden]]\n* [[Cultigen]]\n* [[Garden design]]\n* [[Growbag]]\n* [[Houseplant]]\n* [[Introduced species]]\n* [[Impact gardening]]\n* [[List of gardening topics]]\n* [[List of horticulture and gardening books]]\n* [[List of professional gardeners]]\n* [[Market garden]]\n* [[Master gardener program]]\n* [[No-dig gardening]]\n* [[Orchard]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n[[File:Hayes-Valley-Farm by Zoey-Kroll fava-hillside.jpg|thumb|Berms of fava beans have been planted at Hayes Valley Farm, a community-built farm on the former Central freeway ramps of San Francisco.]]\n* {{cite book\n | url = http://chestofbooks.com/gardening-horticulture/American-Horticultural-Manual-Vol1/index.html\n | title = American Horticultural Manual Part One\n | author = J.

In most countries, marking or painting property without the property owner's permission is considered defacement and [[vandalism]], which is a punishable crime.\n\nGraffiti may also express underlying social and political messages and a whole genre of artistic expression is based upon spray paint graffiti styles. Within [[hip hop culture]], graffiti have evolved alongside [[hip hop music]], [[Breakdancing|b-boying]], and other elements.<ref name=powder/> Unrelated to hip-hop graffiti, gangs use their own form of graffiti to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/get_informed/content_basic_view/23471|title=Why Gang Graffiti Is Dangerous - Los Angeles Police Department|website=www.lapdonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nControversies that surround graffiti continue to create disagreement amongst city officials, law enforcement, and writers who wish to display and appreciate work in public locations. There are many different types and styles of graffiti; it is a rapidly developing art form whose value is highly contested and reviled by many authorities while also subject to protection, sometimes within the same jurisdiction.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Graffiti signature commemorating Union of Lublin 01.jpg|thumb|1569 scratched graffiti in the [[Chapel of the Holy Trinity, Lublin Castle|Holy Trinity Chapel]] in [[Lublin]], commemorating [[Union of Lublin]]]]\nBoth \"graffiti\" and its occasional singular form \"graffito\" are from the Italian word ''graffiato'' (\"scratched\"). \"Graffiti\" is applied in [[art history]] to works of art produced by scratching a design into a surface. A related term is \"[[sgraffito]]\",<ref name=grant/> which involves scratching through one layer of pigment to reveal another beneath it. This technique was primarily used by potters who would glaze their wares and then scratch a design into it. In ancient times graffiti were carved on walls with a sharp object, although sometimes [[chalk]] or [[coal]] were used. The word originates from Greek {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}}\u2014''graphein''\u2014meaning \"to write\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/graffiti|title=graffiti {{!}} Origin and meaning of graffiti by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Graffitti, Castellania, Malta.jpeg|thumb|left|Figure graffito, similar to a relief, at the Castellania, in Valletta]] \nThe term ''graffiti'' referred to the [[inscription]]s, figure drawings, and such, found on the walls of ancient [[sepulchre]]s or ruins, as in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] or at [[Pompeii]].

Local guides say it is an advertisement for [[prostitution]]. Located near a [[mosaic]] and stone walkway, the graffiti shows a handprint that vaguely resembles a heart, along with a footprint, a number, and a carved image of a woman's head. This is believed to indicate that a brothel was nearby, with the handprint symbolizing payment.<ref name=joel/>\n\nThe [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] carved graffiti on walls and monuments, examples of which also survive in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Graffiti in the classical world had different connotations than they carry in today's society concerning content. Ancient graffiti displayed phrases of love declarations, political rhetoric, and simple words of thought, compared to today's popular messages of social and political ideals<ref name=ancel/>\nThe eruption of [[Vesuvius]] preserved graffiti in [[Pompeii]], which includes [[Latin]] curses, magic spells, declarations of love, alphabets, political slogans, and famous literary quotes, providing insight into ancient Roman street life. One inscription gives the address of a woman named Novellia Primigenia of Nuceria, a prostitute, apparently of great beauty, whose services were much in demand. Another shows a [[phallus]] accompanied by the text, ''mansueta tene'' (\"handle with care\").\n\nDisappointed love also found its way onto walls in antiquity:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\n''Quisquis amat. veniat. Veneri volo frangere costas''\n''fustibus et lumbos debilitare deae.''\n''Si potest illa mihi tenerum pertundere pectus''\n''quit ego non possim caput illae frangere fuste?''\n\nWhoever loves, go to hell.

Etched on the surface of the Mirror Wall, they contain pieces of prose, poetry, and commentary. The majority of these visitors appear to have been from the elite of society: royalty, officials, professions, and clergy. There were also soldiers, archers, and even some metalworkers. The topics range from love to satire, curses, wit, and lament. Many demonstrate a very high level of literacy and a deep appreciation of art and poetry.<ref name=ponnam/> Most of the graffiti refer to the frescoes<ref name=seela2/> of semi-nude females found there. One reads:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Wet with cool dew drops\nfragrant with perfume from the flowers\ncame the gentle breeze\njasmine and water lily\ndance in the spring sunshine\nside-long glances\nof the golden-hued ladies\nstab into my thoughts\nheaven itself cannot take my mind\nas it has been captivated by one lass\namong the five hundred I have seen here.<ref name=parana/></poem></blockquote>\n\nAmong the ancient political graffiti examples were [[Arab]] satirist poems. Yazid al-Himyari, an [[Umayyad]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] poet, was most known for writing his political poetry on the walls between [[Sistan|Sajistan]] and [[Basra]], manifesting a strong hatred towards the [[Umayyad]] regime and its ''[[wali]]s'', and people used to read and circulate them very widely.<ref>\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u0648\u0651\u0629\u060c '''\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647'''\u060c \u0645\u0624\u0633\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u062d\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a\u060c 1986{{clarify|date=October 2014}}</ref>{{clarify|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Literacy or illiteracy often revealed in graffiti===\nHistoric forms of graffiti have helped gain understanding into the lifestyles and languages of past cultures. Errors in spelling and grammar in these graffiti offer insight into the degree of literacy in Roman times and provide clues on the pronunciation of spoken Latin. Examples are ''CIL'' IV, 7838: ''Vettium Firmum / aed''[ilem] ''quactiliar''[ii] {{sic}} ''rog''[ant]. Here, \"qu\" is pronounced \"co\". The 83 pieces of graffiti found at ''CIL'' IV, 4706-85 are evidence of the ability to read and write at levels of society where literacy might not be expected. The graffiti appear on a [[peristyle]] which was being remodeled at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius by the architect [[Crescens]]. The graffiti were left by both the foreman and his workers. The brothel at ''CIL'' VII, 12, 18\u201320 contains more than 120 pieces of graffiti, some of which were the work of the prostitutes and their clients. The [[gladiator]]ial academy at ''CIL'' IV, 4397 was scrawled with graffiti left by the gladiator Celadus Crescens (''Suspirium puellarum Celadus thraex'': \"Celadus the [[Thracians|Thracian]] makes the girls sigh.\")\n\nAnother piece from Pompeii, written on a tavern wall about the owner of the establishment and his questionable wine:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nLandlord, may your lies malign\nBring destruction on your head!\nYou yourself drink unmixed wine,\nWater [do you] sell [to] your guests instead.<ref name=olmert/></poem></blockquote>\n\nIt was not only the Greeks and Romans who produced graffiti: the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Tikal]] in [[Guatemala]] contains examples of [[ancient Maya graffiti]]. [[Viking]] graffiti survive in Rome and at [[Newgrange|Newgrange Mound]] in Ireland, and a [[Varangian]] scratched his name (Halvdan) in [[Runic alphabet|rune]]s on a [[banister]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]]. These early forms of graffiti have contributed to the understanding of lifestyles and languages of past cultures.\n\nGraffiti, known as Tacherons, were frequently scratched on Romanesque Scandinavian church walls.<ref name=green/>\nWhen [[Renaissance]] artists such as [[Pinturicchio]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], or [[Filippino Lippi]] descended into the ruins of Nero's [[Domus Aurea]], they carved or painted their names and returned to initiate the ''[[grottesche]]'' style of decoration.<ref name=\"archeology\"/><ref name=\"atlantic\"/>\n\nThere are also examples of graffiti occurring in American history, such as [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], a national landmark along the [[Oregon Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Independence Rock - California National Historic Trail (National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/cali/planyourvisit/site5.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nLater, French soldiers carved their names on monuments during the Napoleonic [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|campaign of Egypt]] in the 1790s.<ref name=JinxArtCrimes/> [[Lord Byron]]'s survives on one of the columns of the Temple of [[Poseidon]] at [[Cape Sounion]] in [[Attica]], Greece.<ref name=shanks/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Ancient graffiti\">\nRufus est caricature villa misteri Pompeii.jpg|Ancient [[Pompeii]] graffito [[caricature]] of a politician\n2487(Admiror paries).jpg|Ironic wall inscription commenting on boring graffiti\nJesus graffito.jpg|Satirical [[Alexamenos graffito]], possibly the earliest known [[representation of Jesus]]\nAncientgrafS.jpg|Graffiti, [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]\nCrusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|Crusader graffiti in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre\nHagia-sofia-viking.jpg|[[Viking]] [[mercenary]] graffiti at the [[Hagia Sofia]] in [[Istanbul, Turkey]]\nSigiriya-graffiti.jpg|Graffiti on the [[Sigiriya#The Mirror Wall|Mirror Wall]], [[Sigiriya]], [[Sri Lanka]]<ref name=seela/>\n</gallery>\n\n== Contemporary graffiti ==\nGraffiti writing is often intertwined with [[hip hop culture]]<ref name=\"genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook\">{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Paul-edwards-is-graffiti-really-an-element-of-hip-hop-book-excerpt-annotated|title=Is Graffiti Really An Element Of Hip-Hop?

However, there are many other instances of notable graffiti in the twentieth century. Graffiti have long appeared on building walls, in [[latrine]]s, railroad [[boxcar]]s, [[rapid transit|subways]], and bridges. The oldest known example of modern graffiti is found on traincars created by hobos and railworkers started more than eighty years ago, called Bozo Texino, documented by filmmaker [[Bill Daniel (filmmaker)|Bill Daniel]] in his 2005 film, ''Who is Bozo Texino?''.<ref name=\"bozo-texino-walker\">{{cite web|url=https://walkerart.org/calendar/2010/who-is-bozo-texino|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=22 July 2010|work=Who Is Bozo Texino?|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Bill|last=Daniel}}</ref><ref name=\"bozo-texino-film\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billdaniel.net/who-is-bozo-texino/|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=2005|work=Who Is Bozo Texino?

In [[World War II]], an inscription on a wall at the fortress of [[Verdun]] was seen as an illustration of the US response twice in a generation to the wrongs of the Old World:<ref name=reagan/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/14/opinion/words-from-a-war.html|title=Words From a War|date=14 August 1985|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nAustin White \u2013 Chicago, Ill \u2013 1918\nAustin White \u2013 Chicago, Ill \u2013 1945\nThis is the last time I want to write my name here.</poem></blockquote>\n\nDuring World War II and for decades after, the phrase \"[[Kilroy was here]]\" with an accompanying illustration was widespread throughout the world, due to its use by American troops and ultimately filtering into American popular culture. Shortly after the death of [[Charlie Parker]] (nicknamed \"Yardbird\" or \"Bird\"), graffiti began appearing around New York with the words \"Bird Lives\".<ref name=russel/> The student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-r\u00e9volutionnaire'' (\"Boredom is counterrevolutionary\") expressed in painted graffiti, [[poster]] art, and [[stencil]] art. At the time in the US, other political phrases (such as \"Free Huey\" about [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Huey Newton]]) became briefly popular as graffiti in limited areas, only to be forgotten. A popular graffito of the early 1970s was \"Dick [[Richard Milhous Nixon|Nixon]] Before He Dicks You\", reflecting the hostility of the youth culture to that US president.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"World War II graffiti\">\nBundesarchiv Bild 101I-309-0816-20A, Italien, Soldat zeichnend.jpg|Soldier with tropical fantasy graffiti (1943\u20131944)\nGraffiti inside the ruins of the German Reichstag building.jpg|Soviet Army graffiti in the ruins of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in [[Berlin]] (1945)\nKilroy Was Here - Washington DC WWII Memorial - Jason Coyne.jpg|Permanent engraving of [[Kilroy was here|Kilroy]] on the [[National World War II Memorial|World War II Memorial]] in [[Washington, DC]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Advent of aerosol paint===\nRock and roll graffiti is a significant subgenre. A famous graffito of the twentieth century was the inscription in the London tube reading \"Clapton is God\" in a link to the guitarist [[Eric Clapton]]. The phrase was spray-painted by an admirer on a wall in an [[Islington]] station on the [[London Underground|Underground]] in the autumn of 1967. The graffito was captured in a photograph, in which a dog is [[Urine marking#Canidae|urinating on the wall]].\n\nGraffiti also became associated with the anti-establishment [[punk rock]] movement beginning in the 1970s. Bands such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Crass]] (and their followers) widely [[stencil]]ed their names and logos, while many punk night clubs, squats, and hangouts are famous for their graffiti. In the late 1980s the upside down Martini glass that was the tag for punk band [[Missing Foundation]] was the most ubiquitous graffito in lower Manhattan, and was copied by hard core punk fans throughout the US and West Germany.<ref name=myspace/>\n\nAlong similar lines was the legend \"[[Frodo Lives!|Frodo Lives]],\" referring to the protagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Early spray-painted graffiti\">\nNYC R36 1 subway car.png|[[New York City Subway]] trains were covered in graffiti (1973)\nGRAFFITI ON A WALL IN CHICAGO.

For many outside of New York, it was their first encounter with their art form. Fab 5 Freddy's friendship with [[Debbie Harry]] influenced [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s single \"[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]\" ([[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]], 1981), the video of which featured [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and offered many their first glimpse of a depiction of elements of graffiti in hip hop culture. JaJaJa toured Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and Holland with a large graffiti canvas as a backdrop.<ref name=chesh/> Charlie Ahearn's independently released fiction film ''[[Wild Style]]'' (Wild Style, 1983), the early [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'' (1983), hit songs such as \"[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]\" and \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" and their accompanying [[music video]]s (both 1982) contributed to a growing interest outside New York in all aspects of hip hop.<ref name=\"genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook\" />\n\n''Style Wars'' depicted not only famous graffiti artists such as Skeme, [[DONDI|Dondi]], MinOne, and [[Zephyr (artist)|ZEPHYR]], but also reinforced graffiti's role within New York's emerging hip-hop culture by incorporating famous early break-dancing groups such as Rock Steady Crew into the film and featuring rap in the soundtrack. Although many officers of the New York City Police Department found this film to be controversial, Style Wars is still recognized as the most prolific film representation of what was going on within the young hip hop culture of the early 1980s.<ref name=labonte/> Fab 5 Freddy and Futura 2000 took hip hop graffiti to Paris and London as part of the New York City Rap Tour in 1983.<ref name=hershk/> Hollywood also paid attention, consulting writers such as [[PHASE 2]] as it depicted the culture and gave it international exposure in movies such as ''[[Beat Street]]'' ([[Orion Pictures|Orion]], 1984).\n\n===Stencil graffiti emerges===\nThis period also saw the emergence of the new [[stencil graffiti]] genre. Some of the first examples were created in 1981 by graffiti artist [[Blek le Rat]] in Paris, in 1982 by [[Jef Aerosol]] in Tours (France);{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} by 1985 stencils had appeared in other cities including New York City, Sydney, and [[Melbourne]], where they were documented by American photographer Charles Gatewood and Australian photographer Rennie Ellis.<ref name=ellis/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Stencil graffiti\">\nTankStencil.jpg|Modern [[stencil graffiti]], a very common style, in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada\nBrokenPromises JohnFekner.jpg|[[John Fekner]] stencils in [[South Bronx]], New York City (1980)\nbanksy.on.the.thekla.arp.jpg|Stencil by [[Banksy]] on the waterline of [[Old Profanity Showboat (Thekla)|The Thekla]], an entertainment boat in central [[Bristol]]\nI-barc.JPG|Stencil in [[Barcelona]], Spain\nGraffiti in Tartu 03.JPG|Stencil graffito by [[Edward von L\u00f5ngus]] in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]], that takes a popular children's book character and manipulates it to produce a social-critical work about the [[war on drugs]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Graffiti as a memorial===\nPeople often leave their traces in wet cement or concrete. This type of graffito often commemorates the mutual commitment of a couple, or simply records a person's presence at a particular moment. Often this type of graffito is dated and is left untouched for decades, offering a look into local historical minutiae.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Commercialization and entrance into mainstream pop culture===\n{{Main|Commercial graffiti}}\nWith the popularity and legitimization of graffiti has come a level of commercialization. In 2001, computer giant [[IBM]] launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a [[peace symbol]], a [[Heart (symbol)|heart]], and a [[penguin]] ([[Linux]] [[mascot]]), to represent \"Peace, Love, and Linux.\" Due to laws forbidding it, some of the \"street artists\" were arrested and charged with vandalism, and IBM was fined more than US$120,000 for punitive damages and clean-up costs.<ref name=guerilla/><ref name=wired/>\n\nIn 2005, a similar ad campaign was launched by [[Sony]] and executed by [[TATS CRU]] in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Miami, to market its handheld [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] gaming system. In [[PlayStation Portable#Controversial advertising campaigns|this campaign]], taking notice of the legal problems of the IBM campaign, Sony paid building owners for the rights to paint on their buildings \"a collection of dizzy-eyed urban kids playing with the PSP as if it were a skateboard, a paddle, or a rocking horse\".<ref name=wired/>\n\n===Gamer culture===\nAlong with the commercial growth has come the rise of [[video game]]s also depicting graffiti, usually in a positive aspect \u2013 for example, the ''[[Jet Set Radio]]'' series (2000\u20132003) tells the story of a group of teens fighting the oppression of a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] police force that attempts to limit the graffiti artists' [[freedom of speech]]. In plotlines mirroring the negative reaction of non-commercial artists to the commercialization of the art form by companies such as IBM (and, later, Sony itself) the ''[[Graffiti Kingdom|Rakugaki \u014ckoku]]'' series (2003\u20132005) for Sony's [[PlayStation 2]] revolves around an anonymous hero and his magically imbued-with-life graffiti creations as they struggle against an evil king who only allows art to be produced which can benefit him. Following the original roots of modern graffiti as a political force came another game title, ''[[Marc Eck\u014d's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure]]'' (2006), featuring a story line involving fighting against a corrupt city and its oppression of free speech, as in the ''Jet Set Radio'' series.\n\nOther games which feature graffiti include ''[[Klark Kent|Bomb the World]]'' (2004), an online graffiti simulation created by graffiti artist [[Klark Kent]] where users can paint trains virtually at 20 locations worldwide, and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' (2002), in which the hero, [[Mario]] must clean the city of graffiti left by the villain, [[Bowser Jr.]] in a plotline which evokes the successes of the Anti-Graffiti Task Force of New York's Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]] (a manifestation of the \"[[Fixing Broken Windows|broken window theory]]\") or those of the \"[[Graffiti Blasters]]\" of Chicago's Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]].\n\nNumerous other non-graffiti-centric video games allow the player to produce graffiti (such as the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]], the [[Tony Hawk's (series)|''Tony Hawk's'' series]], ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City]]'', ''[[Rolling (video game)|Rolling]]'', and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''). ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which is a ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' mod, allows users to create their own graffiti tags to use in the game. Many other titles contain in-game depictions of graffiti, including ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'', ''[[Double Dragon (series)#Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone|Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone]]'', ''[[NetHack]]'', ''[[Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked]]'', ''[[The World Ends with You]]'', ''[[The Warriors (video game)|The Warriors]]'', ''[[Just Cause (video game)|Just Cause]]'', ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', and various examples of [[Virtual Graffiti#Gaming|Virtual Graffiti]]. There also exist games where the term \"graffiti\" is used as a synonym for \"drawing\" (such as ''[[Yahoo! Graffiti]]'', ''[[ImagiNation Network#SierraLand|Graffiti]]'', etc.).\n\n===Advocates===\n[[Marc Ecko]], an urban clothing designer, has been an advocate of graffiti as an art form during this period, stating that \"Graffiti is without question the most powerful art movement in recent history and has been a driving inspiration throughout my career.\"<ref name=sohh/>\n\n[[Henry Chalfant]] is one of the foremost advocates of modern graffiti, having produced the documentary film [[Style Wars]] and co-authored the books ''[[Subway Art]]'' and ''Spray Can Art''. His most recent work, ''Henry Chalfant's Graffiti Archive: New York City's Subway Art and Artists'' displays his over 800 photographs of New York City Subway Graffiti Art.<ref name=chalf/>\n\n[[Keith Haring]] was another well-known graffiti artist who brought Pop Art and graffiti to the commercial mainstream. In the 1980s, Haring opened his first Pop Shop: a store that offered everyone access to his works, which until then could only be found spray-painted on city walls. Pop Shop offered commodities such as bags and t-shirts. Haring explained that \"The Pop Shop makes my work accessible. It's about participation on a big level, the point was that we didn't want to produce things that would cheapen the art. In other words, this was still art as statement.\"<ref name=\"haring-foundation-site\">{{cite web|url=http://www.haring.com/!/pop-shop|title=Pop Shop|date=2018|work=The Keith Haring Foundation Website|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Keith|last=Haring}}</ref>\n\nGraffiti have become a common stepping stone for many members of both the [[art and design]] communities in North America and abroad. Within the United States graffiti artists such as Mike Giant, Pursue, Rime, Noah, and countless others have made careers in skateboard, apparel, and shoe design for companies such as DC Shoes, Adidas, Rebel8, Osiris, or Circa<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Meanwhile, there are many others such as DZINE, Daze, Blade, and The Mac who have made the switch to being gallery artists, often not even using their initial medium, spray paint.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBut perhaps the greatest example of graffiti artists infiltrating mainstream pop culture is the French crew [[123Klan]].  Founded as a graffiti crew in 1989 by Scien and Klor, 123Klan has gradually turned their hands to illustration and design while still maintaining their graffiti practice and style. In doing so they have designed and produced logos and illustrations, shoes, and fashion for the likes of Nike, Adidas, Lamborghini, Coca Cola, Stussy, Sony, Nasdaq, and more.<ref name=grafica/><!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Yarnbus.jpg|thumb|This bus has been [[yarn bombing|yarn bombed]] by a team of knitters. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] -->\n\n===Global developments===\n\n====South America====\nThere is a significant graffiti tradition in South America, especially in [[Brazil]]. Within Brazil, [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] is a significant centre of inspiration for many graffiti artists worldwide.<ref name=manco/>\n\nTristan Manco wrote that Brazil \"boasts a unique and particularly rich, graffiti scene&nbsp;... [earning] it an international reputation as the place to go for artistic inspiration.\" Graffiti \"flourishes in every conceivable space in Brazil's cities.\" Artistic parallels \"are often drawn between the energy of S\u00e3o Paulo today and 1970s New York.\" The \"sprawling metropolis,\" of S\u00e3o Paulo has \"become the new shrine to graffiti;\" Manco alludes to \"poverty and unemployment&nbsp;... [and] the epic struggles and conditions of the country's marginalised peoples,\" and to \"Brazil's chronic poverty,\" as the main engines that \"have fuelled a vibrant graffiti culture.\" In world terms, Brazil has \"one of the most uneven distributions of income. Laws and taxes change frequently.\" Such factors, Manco argues, contribute to a very fluid society, riven with those economic divisions and social tensions that underpin and feed the \"folkloric vandalism and an urban sport for the disenfranchised,\" that is South American graffiti art.<ref name=manco7/>\n\nProminent Brazilian graffiti artists include [[Os G\u00eameos]], Boleta, [[Francisco Rodrigues da Silva|Nunca]], Nina, Speto, Tikka, and T.Freak.<ref name=globo/> Their artistic success and involvement in commercial design ventures<ref name=nicek/> has highlighted divisions within the Brazilian graffiti community between adherents of the cruder transgressive form of ''picha\u00e7\u00e3o'' and the more conventionally artistic values of the practitioners of ''grafite''.<ref name=revela/>\n\n====Middle East====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IMG 6754 3.jpg|thumb|Poetry graffiti in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]]] -->[[File:Graffiti in Tel Aviv, Israel.jpg|thumb|A graffiti piece found in Tel Aviv by the artist DeDe]]\nGraffiti in the [[Middle East]] is emerging slowly, with pockets of taggers operating in the various 'Emirates' of the [[United Arab Emirates]], in [[Israel]], and in [[Iran]]. The major Iranian newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]'' has published two articles on illegal writers in the city with photographic coverage of Iranian artist [[A1one]]'s works on Tehran walls. Tokyo-based design magazine, ''PingMag'', has interviewed A1one and featured photographs of his work.<ref name=pinmag/> The [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] has become a site for graffiti, reminiscent in this sense of the [[Berlin Wall]]. Many graffiti artists in Israel come from other places around the globe, such as JUIF from Los Angeles and DEVIONE from London. The religious reference  \"\u05e0 \u05e0\u05d7 \u05e0\u05d7\u05de \u05e0\u05d7\u05de\u05df \u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05df\" (\"[[Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman]]\") is commonly seen in graffiti around Israel.\n\n====Southeast Asia====\nThere are also a large number of graffiti influences in [[Southeast Asia]]n countries that mostly come from modern [[Western culture]], such as Malaysia, where graffiti have long been a common sight in Malaysia's capital city, [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Since 2010, the country has begun hosting a street festival to encourage all generations and people from all walks of life to enjoy and encourage Malaysian street culture.<ref name=kharbar/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Graffiti around the world\">\nGrafiti, \u010cakovec (Croatia).2.jpg|Graffiti on a wall in [[\u010cakovec]], [[Croatia]]\nOlindaGraffiti.jpg|Artful graffiti of a [[Maracatu]] performer in [[Olinda, Brazil]]\nMAAU-SP.jpg|Open Museum of Urban Art of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nTehranurbanartalone.jpg|Graffiti in [[Tehran, Iran]]\nMr. Wany's work-in-progress artwork for Kul Sign Festival.JPG|Graffiti art in [[Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia]]\nGraffiti in Upper Manhattan November 3, 2013.jpg|Graffiti on a retaining wall in [[Upper Manhattan]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Characteristics of common graffiti ==\n{{See also|Graffiti terminology|Graffiti in the United States}}\n\n===Methods and production===\nThe modern-day graffiti artist can be found with an arsenal of various materials that allow for a successful production of a piece.<ref name=nicolas/> This includes such techniques as [[Scribing (graffiti)|scribing]]. However, [[spray paint]] in aerosol cans is the number one medium for graffiti. From this commodity comes different styles, technique, and abilities to form master works of graffiti. Spray paint can be found at hardware and art stores and comes in virtually every color.\n\n[[Stencil graffiti]], originating in the early 1980s ([[Blek le Rat]], [[Jef Aerosol]], [[Speedy Graphito]], [[Miss Tic]] ... ) is created by cutting out shapes and designs in a stiff material (such as [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] or subject [[File folder|folder]]s) to form an overall design or image.<ref name=drupal/> The stencil is then placed on the \"canvas\" gently and with quick, easy strokes of the aerosol can, the image begins to appear on the intended surface. This method of graffiti is popular amongst artists because of its swift technique that requires very little time. Time is always a factor with graffiti artists due to the constant threat of being caught by law enforcement.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Graffiti making\">\nVlg shop.jpg|The first graffiti shop in Russia was opened in 1992 in [[Tver]]\nEurofestival graffiti 2.jpg|Graffiti artist at work at Eurofestival in [[Turku]], Finland\nGraffiti-Bucharest.jpg|Graffiti artist in [[Bucharest, Romania]]\nGraffity in the making...(On a wall at Thrissur) CIMG9868.JPG|Indian street artist uses natural pigments (mostly [[charcoal]], plant [[sap]]s, and dirt)\nGraffity in the making...(On a wall at Thrissur) CIMG9873.jpg|Completed landscape scene, in [[Thrissur]], [[Kerala]], India\nFile:Leake Street TQ3079 352.JPG|A graffiti artist at work in London\n</gallery>\n\n===Modern experimentation===\n[[File:Knitted graffiti 1.jpg|thumb|right|Knitted graffiti in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]]]\n[[File:Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier.JPG|thumbnail|Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier both hides and highlights previous graffiti.]]\nModern graffiti art often incorporates additional arts and technologies. For example, [[Graffiti Research Lab]] has encouraged the use of projected images and magnetic light-emitting diodes ([[LED art|throwies]]) as new media for graffiti artists. [[Yarnbombing]] is another recent form of graffiti. Yarnbombers occasionally target previous graffiti for modification, which had been avoided among the majority of graffiti artists.\n\n===Tagging===\n[[File:Tag by Spore.jpg|thumb|A tag in [[Dallas]], reading \"Spore\"]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Grafitti on Class 376 train at Cannon Street.jpg|thumb|A tagged {{BRC|376}} train at [[Cannon Street station]]]]\nSome of the most common styles of graffiti have their own names. A '''tag''' is the most basic writing of an artist's name; it is simply a [[handstyle]]. A graffiti writer's tag is his or her personalized signature. Tagging is often the example given when opponents of graffiti refer to any acts of handstyle graffiti writing (it is by far the most common form of graffiti). Tags can contain subtle and sometimes cryptic messages, and may incorporate the artist's crew initials or other letters.\n\nOne form of tagging, known as '''pissing''', involves taking a refillable fire-extinguisher and replacing the contents with paint, allowing for tags as high as approximately {{convert|20|ft|m}}. Aiming and keeping a handstyle steady in this form of tagging is very difficult, usually coming out wavy and sloppy.\n\nAnother form is the '''throw-up''', also known as a '''bombing''', which is normally painted very quickly with two or three colors, sacrificing aesthetics for speed. Throw-ups can also be outlined on a surface with one color. A '''piece''' is a more elaborate representation of the artist's name, incorporating more stylized letters, usually incorporating a much larger range of colors. This is more time-consuming and increases the likelihood of the artist getting caught. A '''blockbuster''' or '''roller''' is a large piece, almost always done in a block-shaped style, done simply to cover a large area solidly with two contrasting colors, sometimes with the whole purpose of blocking other writers from painting on the same wall. These are usually accomplished with extended paint rollers and gallons of cheap exterior paint.\n\nA more complex style is '''[[wildstyle]]''', a form of graffiti usually involving interlocking letters and connecting points. These pieces are often harder to read by non-graffiti artists as the letters merge into one another in an often-undecipherable manner.\n\nSome artists also use self-adhesive '''stickers''' as a quick way to do catch ups. While certain critics from within graffiti culture consider this lazy, stickers can be quite detailed in their own right and often, are used in conjunction with other materials. Sticker tags are commonly executed on blank postage stickers, as these can easily be acquired with no cost on the writer's part.\n\nMany graffiti artists believe that doing complex pieces involves too great an investment of time to justify the practice. Doing a piece can take (depending on experience and size) from 30 minutes to months on end, as was the case for [[Saber (artist)|Saber]] MSK while working on the world's largest graffiti piece on the LA river.\n\nAnother graffiti artist can go over a piece in a matter of minutes with a simple throw-up. This was exemplified by the writer \"CAP\" in the documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'', who, other writers complain, ruins pieces with his quick throw ups. This became known as '''capping''' and often is done when there is a \"beef\", or conflict between writers.\n\nA number of recent examples of graffiti make use of [[hashtags]].<ref>[http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2015/07/23/hashtag-on-the-pavement-connects-with-fitzrovias-past/] \"Hashtag on the pavement connects with Fitzrovia's past\", Fitzrovia News, 23 July 2015, Retrieved 17 January 2016</ref><ref>[http://massappeal.com/riskrock-graffiti-in-san-francisco/] \"#RISKROCK #GRAFFITI IN #SANFRANCISCO\", Mass Appeal, Retrieved 17 January 2016.</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Graffiti i bagg\u00e5rd i \u00e5rhus 2c.jpg|1300px|align-cap=center|Densely-tagged parking area in [[\u00c5rhus]], Denmark|center|}}\n\n== Uses ==\nTheories on the use of graffiti by [[avant-garde]] artists have a history dating back at least to the [[Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism]] in 1961.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMany contemporary analysts and even art critics have begun to see artistic value in some graffiti and to recognize it as a form of [[public art]]. According to many art researchers, particularly in the Netherlands and in Los Angeles, that type of public art is, in fact an effective tool of social [[political emancipation|emancipation]] or, in the achievement of a political goal.<ref name=thimar/>\n\nThe murals of [[Belfast]] and of Los Angeles offer another example of official recognition.<ref name=rpmural/> In times of conflict, such murals have offered a means of communication and self-expression for members of these socially, ethnically, or racially divided communities, and have proven themselves as effective tools in establishing dialog and thus, of addressing cleavages in the long run. The [[Berlin Wall]] was also extensively covered by graffiti reflecting social pressures relating to the oppressive [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule over the [[East Germany|GDR]].\n\nMany artists involved with graffiti are also concerned with the similar activity of [[stenciling]]. Essentially, this entails stenciling a print of one or more colors using spray-paint. Recognized while [[Art exhibition|exhibiting]] and publishing several of her coloured stencils and paintings portraying the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] and [[Urban area|urban Britain]] in the early 2000s, graffiti artist [[M.I.A. (artist)|Mathangi Arulpragasam, aka M.I.A.]], has also become known for integrating her imagery of political violence into her [[music videos]] for singles \"[[Galang (song)|Galang]]\" and \"[[Bucky Done Gun]]\", and her cover art. Stickers of her artwork also often appear around places such as London in [[Brick Lane]], stuck to lamp posts and street signs, she having become a muse for other graffiti artists and painters worldwide in cities including [[Seville]].<ref name=teleci/> Graffiti artist [[John Fekner]], called \"caption writer to the urban environment, adman for the opposition\" by writer [[Lucy Lippard]],<ref name=lippard/> was involved in direct art interventions within New York City's [[Urban decay|decaying]] urban environment in the mid-1970s through the 1980s. Fekner is known for his word installations targeting social and political issues, stenciled on buildings throughout New York.\n\n=== Personal expression ===\n[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] celebrating personal expression]]Graffiti artists constantly have the looming threat of facing consequences for displaying their graffiti. Many choose to protect their identities and reputation by remaining anonymous.\n\nWith the commercialization of graffiti (and [[hip hop]] in general), in most cases, even with legally painted \"graffiti\" art, graffiti artists tend to choose anonymity. This may be attributed to various reasons or a combination of reasons. Graffiti still remains the [[hip hop#Cultural pillars|one of four hip hop elements]] that is not considered \"performance art\" despite the image of the \"singing and dancing star\" that sells hip hop culture to the mainstream. Being a graphic form of art, it might also be said that many graffiti artists still fall in the category of the [[Extraversion and introversion#Introversion|introverted archetypal artist]].\n\n[[Banksy]] is one of the world's most notorious and popular street artists who continues to remain faceless in today's society.<ref name=banksy/> He is known for his political, anti-war stencil art mainly in [[Bristol, England]], but his work may be seen anywhere from Los Angeles to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. In the UK, Banksy is the most recognizable icon for this cultural artistic movement and keeps his identity a secret to avoid arrest. Much of Banksy's artwork may be seen around the streets of London and surrounding suburbs, although he has painted pictures throughout the world, including the Middle East, where he has painted on Israel's controversial [[West Bank]] barrier with satirical images of life on the other side. One depicted a hole in the wall with an idyllic beach, while another shows a mountain landscape on the other side. A number of [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]] also have taken place since 2000, and recent works of art have fetched vast sums of money. Banksy's art is a prime example of the classic controversy: vandalism vs. art. Art supporters endorse his work distributed in urban areas as pieces of art and some councils, such as Bristol and Islington, have officially protected them, while officials of other areas have deemed his work to be vandalism and have removed it.\n\n[[Pixnit]] is another artist who chooses to keep her identity from the general public.<ref name=shaer/> Her work focuses on beauty and design aspects of graffiti as opposed to Banksy's anti-government shock value. Her paintings are often of flower designs above shops and stores in her local urban area of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Some store owners endorse her work and encourage others to do similar work as well. \"One of the pieces was left up above Steve's Kitchen, because it looks pretty awesome\"- Erin Scott, the manager of [[New England Comics]] in [[Allston, Massachusetts]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Personal graffiti\">\nGraffiti at the Temple of Philae (XIII).jpg|Drawing at [[Temple of Philae]], Egypt depicting three men with rods, or staves.\n4091(Quisquis amat).jpg|Inscription in [[Pompeii]] lamenting a frustrated love, \"Whoever loves, let him flourish, let him perish who knows not love, let him perish twice over whoever forbids love.\"\nPost Apocalyptic Zombie Graffiti, Jan 2015.jpg|[[Post-apocalyptic]] despair\nMermaid Sliema.JPG|[[Mermaid]] in [[Sliema]], [[Malta]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Radical and political ===\n[[File:M2109 Iraq War Protest (Black Bloc Element).jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Black bloc]] members spray graffiti on a wall during an [[Protests against the Iraq War#March 21, 2009|Iraq War Protest]] in Washington, D.C.]]\nGraffiti often has a reputation as part of a subculture that rebels against authority, although the considerations of the practitioners often diverge and can relate to a wide range of attitudes. It can express a political practice and can form just one tool in an array of resistance techniques. One early example includes the [[anarcho-punk]] band [[Crass]], who conducted a campaign of stenciling [[anti-war]], [[anarchism|anarchist]], [[feminism|feminist]], and [[consumerism|anti-consumerist]] messages throughout the [[London Underground]] system during the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref name=souther/> In [[Amsterdam]] graffiti was a major part of the punk scene. The city was covered with names such as \"De Zoot\", \"Vendex\", and \"Dr Rat\".<ref name=stockho/> To document the graffiti a punk magazine was started that was called ''Gallery Anus''. So when hip hop came to Europe in the early 1980s there was already a vibrant graffiti culture.\n\nThe student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-r\u00e9volutionnaire'' (\"Boredom is counterrevolutionary\") and ''Lisez moins, vivez plus'' (\"Read less, live more\"). While not exhaustive, the graffiti gave a sense of the 'millenarian' and rebellious spirit, tempered with a good deal of verbal wit, of the strikers.\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=220px|quote=I think graffiti writing is a way of defining what our generation is like. Excuse the French, we're not a bunch of p---- artists. Traditionally artists have been considered soft and mellow people, a little bit kooky. Maybe we're a little bit more like pirates that way.

These movements or styles tend to classify the artists by their relationship to their social and economic contexts, since, in most countries, graffiti art remains illegal in many forms except when using non-permanent paint. Since the 1990s with the rise of [[Street Art]], a growing number of artists are switching to non-permanent paints and non-traditional forms of painting<ref name=\"ziptopia-switch\">{{cite web|url=https://www.zipcar.com/ziptopia/city-living/temporary-street-art-changing-the-graffiti-game|title=Temporary Street Art That\u2019s Changing The Graffiti Game|work=Ziptopia|first=STEVEN|last=HARRINGTON |accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"huffpost-streetart\">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-english/street-art-its-not-meant-_b_5610496.html|title=Street Art: It\u2019s Not Meant to be Permanent|work=Huffington Post|first=Ron|last=English|date=6 Dec 2017|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref> for a variety of reasons\u2014but primarily because is it difficult for the police to apprehend them and for the courts to sentence or even convict a person for a protest that is as fleeting and less intrusive than marching in the streets. In some communities, such impermanent works survive longer than works created with permanent paints because the community views the work in the same vein as that of the civil protester who marches in the street\u2014such protest are impermanent, but effective nevertheless.\n\nIn some areas where a number of artists share the impermanence ideal, an informal competition develops:  the length of time that a work escapes destruction is viewed as a measure of the respect the work garners in the community. A crude work that deserves little respect would be invariably removed immediately, while the most talented artists might have works last for days.\n\nContemporary practitioners, accordingly, have varied and often conflicting practices. Some individuals, such as [[Alexander Brener]], have used the medium to politicize other art forms, and have used the prison sentences enforced on them as a means of further protest.<ref name=\"voice\" />\nThe practices of anonymous groups and individuals also vary widely, and practitioners by no means always agree with each other's practices. For example, the anti-capitalist art group the [[Space Hijackers]] did a piece in 2004 about the contradiction between the capitalistic elements of Banksy and his use of political [[imagery]].<ref name=\"tanyabaxter-Gallery\">{{cite web|url=http://tanyabaxtercontemporary.com/banksy#!Banksy_Flying_Copper__screen_print_on_paper__100_x_70_cm|title= Banksy |work=Tanya Baxter Contemporary Gallery|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"haynes-banksy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.haynesfineart.com/artists/Banksy--|title= Banksy |work=Haynes Fine Art|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn top of the political aspect of graffiti as a [[Cultural movement|movement]], political groups and individuals may also use graffiti as a tool to spread their [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. This practice, due to its illegality, has generally become favored by groups excluded from the political mainstream (e.g. [[far-left]] or [[far-right]] groups) who justify their activity by pointing out that they do not have the money \u2013 or sometimes the desire \u2013 to buy [[advertising]] to get their message across, and that a \"[[ruling class]]\" or \"establishment\" controls the mainstream press, systematically excluding the radical and alternative point of view. This type of graffiti can seem crude; for example [[Fascism|fascist]] supporters often scrawl [[swastika]]s and other [[Nazism|Nazi]] images.\n\nOne innovative form of graffiti that emerged in the UK in the 1970s was devised by the Money Liberation Front (MLF), essentially a loose affiliation of [[underground press]] writers such as the poet and playwright [[Heathcote Williams]] and magazine editor and playwright Jay Jeff Jones. They initiated the use of paper currency as a medium for [[counterculture]] propaganda, overprinting banknotes, usually with a [[John Bull]] printing set. Although short lived, the MLF was representative of London's [[Ladbroke Grove]] centered alternative and literary community of the period. The area was also a scene of considerable [[anti-establishment]] and humorous street graffiti, much of which is also produced by Williams.<ref name=history/> In 2009, following the elections in Iran, protesters (who regarded the electoral result as rigged) began to deface banknotes with slogans such as \"Death to the dictator\". In Colombia writing and drawing on banknotes has become increasingly popular, either to make political comments, for fun or as an artistic medium. The national government has run advertising campaigns in an attempt to discourage the practice. In the UK there have been signs of an MLF resurgence with a number of banknotes in circulation being over-marked with protest slogans such as \"Banks=Robbers\", relating to the perceived culpability of banks in the financial crisis.\n\nBoth sides of the conflict in [[Northern Ireland]] produce political graffiti. As well as slogans, Northern Irish political graffiti includes large wall paintings, referred to as ''[[Northern Irish murals|murals]]''. Along with the flying of flags and the painting of kerb stones, the murals serve a territorial purpose, often associated with gang use. Artists paint them mostly on house gables or on the ''[[Belfast Peace Lines|Peace Lines]]'', high walls that separate different communities.\n\nThe murals often develop over an extended period and tend to stylization, with a strong symbolic or [[iconographic]] content. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist]] murals often refer to historical events dating from the war between [[James II of England|James II]] and [[William III of England|William III]] in the late seventeenth century, whereas [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] murals usually refer to the more recent [[The Troubles|troubles]].\n\nTerritorial graffiti marks urban neighborhoods with tags and logos to differentiate certain groups from others. These images are meant to show outsiders a stern look at whose turf is whose. The subject matter of gang-related graffiti consists of cryptic [[symbols]] and [[initials]] strictly fashioned with unique [[calligraphies]]. Gang members use graffiti to designate membership throughout the gang, to differentiate rivals and associates and, most commonly, to mark borders which are both territorial and ideological.<ref name=ley/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Political graffiti around the world\">\nNablus Graffiti Resistance Victor Grigas 2011-01-76.jpg|Wall in [[Nablus]], [[West Bank]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (2011)\nVote for Filip Filipovic.jpg|Wall in Sremska Street in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], with the slogan \"Vote for [[Filip Filipovi\u0107 (politician)|Filip Filipovi\u0107]]\", who was the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|communist]] candidate for the [[mayor of Belgrade]] (1920)\nThe separation barrier which runs through Bethlehem.jpg|An interpretation of ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' on the separation barrier which runs through [[Bethlehem]]\nBerlinAnhalterBunker.jpg|WWII bunker near [[Anhalter Bahnhof]] ([[Berlin]]) with a graffiti inscription ''Wer Bunker baut, wirft Bomben'' (those who build bunkers, throw bombs)\nGates in the 'Peace Line'.jpg|Gates in a peace line in West Belfast, marking the boundary between [[Segregation in Northern Ireland|segregated communities in Northern Ireland]]\nAmsterdam Grafitti Freedom Lives When the State Dies.png|Graffiti on the train line leading to Central Station in Amsterdam\nRiia-002.JPG|\"Let's JOKK\" in [[Tartu]] refers to political scandal with the [[Estonian Reform Party]] (2012)\nMural painting celebrating Pol Pot in Sundsvall.jpg|Mural tribute to Cambodian revolutionary leader [[Pol Pot]] in [[Sundsvall]], Sweden (2007)\nMoscow Russia anti-Putin Graffiti R-EVOLUTION-2.jpg|\"R-evolution\" stencil [[Vladimir Putin|pro-Putin]] graffito in [[Moscow]], Russia (2012)\nEgyptian Anonymous - \u062b\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0641\u0627\u062f \u0647\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062c\u0627\u062f.jpg|Egyptian stencil combining a [[Pharaoh|Pharaonic]] image with a [[V for Vendetta (film)|Guy Fawkes]] mask\nPieks\u00e4m\u00e4ki - Kekkos-graffiti IMG 0227 C.JPG|Stencil in [[Pieks\u00e4m\u00e4ki]] representing former president of Finland, [[Urho Kekkonen]], well known in Finnish popular culture\nOneWaytoPeace Donated By Matthew Staben DivineSnapshots.com Sept.19.2010.jpg|[[Peace symbol]] added to traffic sign\nKeep your rosaries graffiti.jpg|[[Feminist graffiti]] in [[A Coru\u00f1a]], Spain that reads in [[Galician language|Galician]]: \"Keep your rosaries off our ovaries\"\nAustralia steals Timor Oil.jpg|[[East Timor]]ese protest against Australian petroleum extraction\nGraffiti in Montclair.JPG|Graffiti as a method of expressing sexual orientation in [[Montclair, California]]\nSanctuary - Berlin Wall.JPG|Picture of two [[Eastern Bloc]] leaders kissing, on the [[Berlin Wall]]\nBethlehem Wall Graffiti 1.jpg|Ironic graffiti in [[Bethlehem]]\nGraffiti Nale\u017cysz do stada?.JPG|This Polish graffiti asks, \"Do you belong to the herd?\"\nKeizer artwork.JPG|Protest stencil in [[Cairo, Egypt]] (2011)\nBerliner Mauer.jpg|[[Berlin Wall]]: \"Anyone who wants to keep the world as it is, does not want it to remain\"\nGeorgia (666).jpg|Graffiti of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] with sign [[Diarrhea]] above, [[Tbilisi]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== As advertising ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}\nGraffiti has been used as a means of advertising both legally and illegally. [[The Bronx|Bronx]]-based [[TATS CRU]] has made a name for themselves doing legal advertising campaigns for companies such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[McDonald's]], [[Toyota]], and [[MTV]]. In the UK, Covent Garden's [[Boxfresh]] used stencil images of a [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] revolutionary in the hopes that cross referencing would promote their store.\n\nTech Giants Hewlett Packard used graffiti company [[Darren Cullen#Graffiti Kings|Graffiti Kings]] based in London to showcase the creative use for their Sprout computer by producing a video, during the video Hewlett Packard showed many pieces of graffiti art while the Graffiti Kings artist used the Sprout computer to draw digital graffiti.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11408538/HP-Sprout-is-this-the-future-of-desktop-computing.html|title=HP Sprout: is this the future of desktop computing?|newspaper= Telegraph}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://graffitikings.co.uk/hp-hewlett-packard-sprout-graffiti-kings/|title=\nHP \u2013 Hewlett Packard Sprout & Graffiti Kings|website= Graffitikings}}</ref> [[Smirnoff]] hired artists to use [[reverse graffiti]] (the use of high pressure hoses to clean dirty surfaces to leave a clean image in the surrounding dirt) to increase awareness of their product. [[Shepard Fairey]] rose to fame after his \"Andre the Giant Has a Posse\" sticker campaign, in which his art was plastered in cities throughout America.\n\nMany graffiti artists see legal advertising as no more than \"paid for and legalised graffiti\", and have risen against mainstream ads. The [[Graffiti Research Lab]] crew have gone on to target several prominent ads in New York as a means of making a statement against this practice.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Advertising graffiti\">\n1969(Lais felat).jpg|Ancient [[Pompeii]]an graffiti advertising by a [[pimp]]\nGrafitti as advertising in China 02.jpg|Graffiti as advertising in [[Haikou]], [[Hainan]] Province, China, which is an extremely common form of graffiti seen throughout the country\nWarszawa Stary Mokot\u00f3w graffiti on shop window.jpg|Graffiti as legal advertising on a grocer's shop window in [[Warsaw, Poland]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Offensive graffiti ===\n[[File:Stop graffitti.jpg|thumb|Gang symbol markings on public property, [[Millwood, Washington]]]]\nGraffiti may also be used as an offensive expression. This form of graffiti may be difficult to identify, as it is mostly removed by the local authority (as councils which have adopted strategies of criminalization also strive to remove graffiti quickly).<ref name=halsey/> Therefore, existing racist graffiti is mostly more subtle and at first sight, not easily recognized as \"racist\". It can then only be understood if one knows the relevant \"local code\" (social, historical, political, temporal, and spatial), which is seen as [[heteroglossia|heteroglot]] and thus a 'unique set of conditions' in a cultural context.<ref name=holqu/>\n:A spatial code for example, could be that there is a certain youth group in an area that is engaging heavily in racist activities. So, for residents (knowing the local code), a graffiti containing only the name or abbreviation of this gang already is a racist expression, reminding the offended people of their gang activities. Also a graffiti is in most cases, the [[herald]] of more serious criminal activity to come.<ref name=kelling/> A person who does not know these gang activities would not be able to recognize the meaning of this graffiti. Also if a tag of this youth group or gang is placed on a building occupied by asylum seekers, for example, its racist character is even stronger.\nHence, the lack of obvious racist graffiti does not necessarily mean that there is none. By making the graffiti less explicit (as adapted to social and legal constraints),<ref name=barker/> these drawings are less likely to be removed, but do not lose their threatening and offensive character.<ref name=lynn/>\n\nElsewhere, activists in Russia have used painted [[caricature]]s of local officials with their mouths as [[pothole]]s, to show their anger about the poor state of the roads.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schreck |first=Carl |date=2015-06-19 |title=Russian politicians mocked with guerrilla pothole portraits |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/russia-pothole-portraits-activists-banksy |website= New East Network |access-date=2015-09-24}}</ref> In [[Manchester, England]] a graffiti artist painted obscene images around potholes, which often resulted in their being repaired within 48 hours.<ref>{{cite news |date=2015-04-29 |title=Meet the man using penises to fill potholes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/11570595/Meet-the-man-using-penises-to-fill-potholes.html |website= The Telegraph |access-date=2015-09-24}}</ref>\n\n== Decorative and high art ==\n{{Main|Street art}}\n[[File:JonesyLondon.jpg|thumb|upright|A bronze work by Jonesy on a wall in Brick Lane ([[London]]).

It displayed 22 works by New York graffiti artists, including [[Crash (graffiti artist)|Crash]], Daze, and [[Lady Pink]]. In an article about the exhibition in the magazine ''Time Out'', curator Charlotta Kotik said that she hoped the exhibition would cause viewers to rethink their assumptions about graffiti. [[Terrance Lindall]], an artist and executive director of the Williamsburg Art and Historic Center, said regarding graffiti and the exhibition:<ref name=tonyk/>\n\n<blockquote>\"Graffiti is revolutionary, in my opinion\", he says, \"and any revolution might be considered a crime. People who are oppressed or suppressed need an outlet, so they write on walls\u2014it's free.\"</blockquote>\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards, [[Burhan Dogancay]] photographed urban walls all over the world; these he then archived for use as sources of inspiration for his painterly works. The project today known as \"Walls of the World\" grew beyond even his own expectations and comprises about 30,000 individual images. It spans a period of 40 years across five continents and 114 countries. In 1982, photographs from this project comprised a one-man exhibition titled \"Les murs murmurent, ils crient, ils chantent...\" (The walls whisper, shout and sing ... ) at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]].\n\nIn Australia, art historians have judged some local graffiti of sufficient creative merit to rank them firmly within the arts. [[Oxford University Press]]'s art history text ''Australian Painting 1788\u20132000'' concludes with a long discussion of graffiti's key place within contemporary [[visual culture]], including the work of several Australian practitioners.<ref name=smithea/>\n\nBetween March and April 2009, 150 artists exhibited 300 pieces of graffiti at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris \u2014 a clear acceptance of the art form into the French [[art world]].<ref name=rfi/><ref name=rohter/>\n\nMany graffiti artists have used their design talents in other artistic endeavors. In 2009 graffiti artist \"[[Scape (graffiti artist)|Scape]]\" published ''GRAFF; the Art & Technique of Graffiti'', the world's first book dedicated to displaying the full techniques of creating graffiti art. Other books that focus on graffiti include ''Faith of Graffiti'' by Norman Mailer, ''Trespass'' by Taschen press,<ref name=urbana/> and the comic book by [[Elite Gudz]], ''Concrete Immortalz'', which has a graffiti artist as its main character.\n\nFigurines by [[KAWS (artist)|KAWS]], featuring icons of pop culture, often with crossed-out eyes, run in limited editions and sell for thousands of dollars.<ref name=intmag/> World-renowned street artist Banksy directed a film in 2010, ''[[Exit Through the Gift Shop]]'', which explored street art and commercialism.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Street art graffiti\">\nMiss Van y Ciou (aikijuanma).jpg|Graffiti by [[Miss Van]] and Ciou in [[Barcelona]]\nGraffiti Obelisco.jpg|Graffiti in [[Buenos Aires]], showing the [[El Obelisco|Obelisk]]\n2009 010 CES utka.JPG|''Return of the three funny types'' by Dutch graffiti artist [[Ces53]]\nGraffiti Hamburg No false move.JPG|Graffiti ''No false move'' in [[Hamburg]]\nElisabethmarkt Muenchen Graffiti 2.jpg|Decorative wall painting at Elisabethmarkt in [[Munich]]\nWarsaw-graffiti-face.jpg|Wall art in [[Warsaw]]\nOlindaGraffiti.jpg|This artwork makes use of existing windows in [[Olinda]], [[Pernambuco, Brazil]]\nZeichen der Zeit Hochhaus-Graffiti.jpg|This is said to be the tallest graffiti in the world, at [[Hamburg-Lohbr\u00fcgge]], Germany\nStreet art, Batumi.jpg|Graffiti in [[Batumi]], Georgia\nGraffiti in Sydney Mines, NS.png|Graffiti on an abandoned wall in [[Nova Scotia]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Environmental effects==\n[[Spray paint]] has many negative environmental effects.

Since 2005 they have been allowed to freely display their work along some sections of riverside retaining walls in designated \"Graffiti Zones\".<ref name=taitimes/> From 2007, Taipei's department of cultural affairs also began permitting graffiti on fences around major public construction sites. Department head Yong-ping Lee (\u674e\u6c38\u840d) stated, \"We will promote graffiti starting with the public sector, and then later in the private sector too. It's our goal to beautify the city with graffiti\". The government later helped organize a graffiti contest in [[Ximending]], a popular shopping district. Graffiti artists caught working outside of these designated areas still face fines up to $6,000 TWD under a department of environmental protection regulation.<ref name=taitimes2/> However, Taiwanese authorities can be relatively lenient, one veteran police officer stating anonymously, \"Unless someone complains about vandalism, we won't get involved.

Fay]], questioned him, and subsequently charged him with vandalism. Fay pleaded guilty to vandalizing a car in addition to stealing road signs. Under the 1966 [[Vandalism Act (Singapore)|Vandalism Act of Singapore]], originally passed to curb the spread of communist graffiti in Singapore, the court sentenced him to four months in jail, a fine of S$3,500 (US$2,233), and a [[caning]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran several editorials and op-eds that condemned the punishment and called on the American public to flood the Singaporean embassy with protests. Although the Singapore government received many calls for [[pardon|clemency]], Fay's caning took place in Singapore on 5 May 1994. Fay had originally received a sentence of six strokes of the cane, but the presiding [[president of Singapore]], [[Ong Teng Cheong]], agreed to reduce his caning sentence to four lashes.<ref name=nyt/>\n\nIn [[Republic of Korea|South Korea]], Park Jung-soo was fined 2 million [[South Korean won]] by the [[Seoul]] Central District Court for spray-painting a rat on posters of the [[G-20]] Summit a few days before the event in November 2011. Park alleged that the initial in \"G-20\" sounds like the Korean word for \"rat\", but Korean government prosecutors alleged that Mr. Park was making a derogatory statement about the president of ROK, [[Lee Myung-bak]], the host of the summit. This case led to public outcry and debate on the lack of government tolerance and in support of freedom of expression.

In August 2004, the [[Keep Britain Tidy]] campaign issued a press release calling for [[zero tolerance]] of graffiti and supporting proposals such as issuing \"on the spot\" [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s to graffiti offenders and banning the sale of aerosol paint to anyone under the age of 16.<ref name=encams/> The press release also condemned the use of graffiti images in advertising and in [[music video]]s, arguing that real-world experience of graffiti stood far removed from its often-portrayed 'cool' or 'edgy' image.\n\nTo back the campaign, 123 [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s (including then [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]), signed a charter which stated: \"Graffiti is not art, it's crime.

One early example is the \"Graffiti Tunnel\" located at the [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] Campus of the [[University of Sydney]], which is available for use by any student at the university to tag, advertise, poster, and create \"art\". Advocates of this idea suggest that this discourages petty vandalism yet encourages artists to take their time and produce great art, without worry of being caught or arrested for vandalism or [[trespassing]].<ref name=warrin/><ref name=abc/> Others disagree with this approach, arguing that the presence of legal graffiti walls does not demonstrably reduce illegal graffiti elsewhere.<ref name=towno/> Some local government areas throughout Australia have introduced \"anti-graffiti squads\", who clean graffiti in the area, and such crews as BCW (Buffers Can't Win) have taken steps to keep one step ahead of local graffiti cleaners.\n\nMany state governments have banned the sale or possession of spray paint to those under the age of 18 (age of majority). However, a number of local governments in Victoria have taken steps to recognize the cultural heritage value of some examples of graffiti, such as prominent political graffiti. Tough new graffiti laws have been introduced in Australia with fines of up to A$26,000 and two years in prison.\n\n[[Melbourne]] is a prominent graffiti city of Australia with many of its lanes being tourist attractions, such as [[Hosier Lane, Melbourne|Hosier Lane]] in particular, a popular destination for photographers, wedding photography, and backdrops for corporate print advertising. The [[Lonely Planet]] travel guide cites Melbourne's street as a major attraction. All forms of graffiti, including [[sticker]] art, [[poster]], [[stencil]] art, and [[wheatpasting]], can be found in many places throughout the city. Prominent street art precincts include; [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Northcote, Victoria|Northcote]], [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St. Kilda]], and the CBD, where stencil and sticker art is prominent. As one moves farther away from the city, mostly along suburban train lines, graffiti tags become more prominent. Many international artists such as Banksy have left their work in Melbourne and in early 2008 a [[perspex]] screen was installed to prevent a Banksy stencil art piece from being destroyed, it has survived since 2003 through the respect of local street artists avoiding posting over it, although it has recently had paint tipped over it.<ref name=wato/>\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n[[File:Christchurch Stock Yards.jpg|thumb|Former Christchurch stock yards]]\nIn February 2008 [[Helen Clark]], the New Zealand prime minister at that time, announced a government crackdown on tagging and other forms of graffiti vandalism, describing it as a destructive crime representing an invasion of public and private property. New legislation subsequently adopted included a ban on the sale of paint spray cans to persons under 18 and increases in maximum fines for the offence from NZ$200 to NZ$2,000 or extended community service. The issue of tagging become a widely debated one following an incident in [[Auckland]] during January 2008 in which a middle-aged property owner stabbed one of two teenage taggers to death and was subsequently convicted of [[manslaughter]].\n\n===United States===\n[[Image:Elevator graffiti.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An elevator position indicator with scratch graffiti]]\n{{Main|Graffiti in the United States}}\n\n====Tracker databases====\nGraffiti databases have increased in the past decade because they allow vandalism incidents to be fully documented against an offender and help the police and prosecution charge and prosecute offenders for multiple counts of vandalism. They also provide law enforcement the ability to rapidly search for an offender's moniker or tag in a simple, effective, and comprehensive way. These systems can also help track costs of damage to city to help allocate an anti-graffiti budget. The theory is that when an offender is caught putting up graffiti, they are not just charged with one count of vandalism; they can be held accountable for all of the other damage for which they are responsible. This has two main benefits for law enforcement. One, it sends a signal to the offenders that their vandalism is being tracked. Two, a city can seek restitution from offenders for all of the damage that they have committed, not merely a single incident. These systems give law enforcement personnel real-time, street-level intelligence that allows them to not only focus on the worst graffiti offenders and their damage, but also to monitor potential gang violence that is associated with the graffiti.<ref name=crcp/>\n\n====Gang injunctions====\nMany restrictions of civil gang injunctions are designed to help address and protect the physical environment and limit graffiti. Provisions of gang injunctions include things such as restricting the possession of marker pens, spray paint cans, or other sharp objects capable of defacing private or public property; spray painting, or marking with marker pens, scratching, applying stickers, or otherwise applying graffiti on any public or private property, including, but not limited to the street, alley, residences, block walls, and fences, vehicles and/or any other real or personal property. Some injunctions contain wording that restricts damaging or vandalizing the property of another, both public and private property, including, but limited to any vehicle, light fixture, door, fence, wall, gate, window, building, street sign, utility box, telephone box, trees, or power pole.<ref name=crcp2 />\n\n====Hotlines and reward programs====\nTo help address many of these issues, many local jurisdictions have set up graffiti abatement hotlines, where citizens can call in and report vandalism and have it removed. San Diego's hotline receives more than 5,000 calls per year, in addition to reporting the graffiti, callers can learn more about prevention. One of the complaints about these hotlines is the response time; there is often a lag time between a property owner calling about the graffiti and its removal. The length of delay should be a consideration for any jurisdiction planning on operating a hotline. Local jurisdictions must convince the callers that their complaint of vandalism will be a priority and cleaned off right away. If the jurisdiction does not have the resources to respond to complaints in a timely manner, the value of the hotline diminishes. Crews must be able to respond to individual service calls made to the graffiti hotline as well as focus on cleanup near schools, parks, and major intersections and transit routes to have the biggest impact. Some cities offer a reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of suspects for tagging or graffiti related vandalism. The amount of the reward is based on the information provided, and the action taken.<ref name=lawtec/>\n\n====Search warrants====\nWhen the police use search warrants in connection with a vandalism investigation they are often seeking judicial approval to look for items such as cans of spray paint and nozzles from other kinds of aerosol sprays, etching tools, or other sharp or pointed objects used to etch or scratch glass and other hard surfaces, such as permanent marking pens and markers or paint sticks; evidence of membership or affiliation with any gang or tagging crew, paraphernalia to include any reference to \"(tagger's name),\" and any drawings, writings, objects, or graffiti depicting taggers' names, initials, logos, monikers, slogans, or mention of tagging crew membership; any newspaper clippings relating details of or referring to any graffiti crime.<ref name=paladin/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Graffiti in the United States\">\nSUBWAY CAR - NARA - 554325.jpg|Rampant graffiti hampers visibility into and out of subway cars (1973)\nGraffiti Tunnel (2078441177).jpg|Graffiti-lined tunnel in [[San Francisco]]\nSmear Street Art1.jpg|Graffiti in [[Los Angeles]] (2006)\nLove your country, not government.jpg|Anti-governmental graffiti in [[Bolinas, California]]\nI'm a Man Mural in Memphis 2.jpg|Protest art in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Documentaries==<!-- chronological ! -->\n* ''[[80 Blocks From Tiffany's|80 Blocks from Tiffany's]]'' (1979) \u2013 A rare glimpse into late 1970s New York toward the end of the infamous South Bronx gangs, the documentary shows many sides of the mainly Puerto Rican community of the South Bronx, including reformed gang members, current gang members, the police, and the community leaders who try to reach out to them.\n*''[[Stations of the Elevated]]'' (1980), the earliest documentary about subway graffiti in New York City, with music by Charles Mingus.\n*''[[Style Wars]]'' (1983), an early documentary on hip hop culture, made in New York City.\n*''[[Piece by Piece (documentary)|Piece by Piece]]'' (2005), a feature-length documentary on the history of San Francisco graffiti from the early 1980s until the present day.\n*''[[Infamy (film)|Infamy]]'' (2005), a feature-length documentary about graffiti culture as told through the experiences of six well-known graffiti writers and a graffiti buffer.\n*''[[NEXT: A Primer on Urban Painting]]'' (2005), a documentary about global graffiti culture.\n*''[[RASH (film)|RASH]]'' (2005), a feature documentary about Melbourne, Australia and the artists who make it a living host for illegal artwork called street art.\n*''[[Bomb It]]'' (2007) is one of the most extensive and elaborate documentations of the graffiti movement.

The character first appeared in [[Ishir\u014d Honda]]'s 1954 film ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' and became a worldwide pop culture icon, appearing in various media, including 31 films produced by [[Toho]], [[Godzilla (franchise)#American productions|three Hollywood films]], and numerous [[Godzilla video games|video games]], novels, [[Godzilla (comics)|comic books]], [[Godzilla (franchise)#Television|television shows]]. It is often dubbed the \"King of the Monsters\", a phrase first used in ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]'', the Americanized version of the original film.\n\nGodzilla is depicted as an enormous, destructive, prehistoric sea monster awakened and empowered by [[Radioactive decay|nuclear radiation]]. With the [[nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru|Lucky Dragon 5]]'' incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness, Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for [[nuclear weapon]]s.{{sfn|Brothers|2009|p=}} As the film series expanded, some stories took on less serious undertones, portraying Godzilla as an [[antihero]], or a lesser threat who defends humanity. With the end of the [[Cold War]], several post-1984 ''Godzilla'' films shifted the character's portrayal to themes including Japan's forgetfulness over its imperial past,{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=83}} [[natural disaster]]s, and the [[human condition]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Robbie Collin |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10820543/Gareth-Edwards-interview-I-wanted-Godzilla-to-reflect-the-questions-raised-by-Fukushima.html |title=Gareth Edwards interview: 'I wanted Godzilla to reflect the questions raised by Fukushima' |publisher=The Telegraph |date=May 13, 2014 |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nGodzilla has been featured alongside many supporting characters.

The American production was released theatrically in the United States in the summer of 1963 by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film was released in Japan on August 11, 1962.\n\n==Plot==\nMr. Tako, head of Pacific Pharmaceuticals, is frustrated with the television shows his company is sponsoring and wants something to boost his ratings. When a doctor tells Tako about a giant monster he discovered on the small Faro Island, Tako believes that it would be a brilliant idea to use the monster to gain publicity. Tako immediately sends two men, Sakurai and Kinsaburo, to find and bring back the monster. Meanwhile, the American [[submarine]] ''Seahawk'' gets caught in an [[iceberg]]. The iceberg collapses, unleashing [[Godzilla]] (who, in the Japanese version, had been trapped within since [[Godzilla Raids Again|1955]]), who then destroys the submarine and a nearby Arctic military base.\n\nOn Faro Island, a giant octopus attacks the native village. The mysterious Faro monster, revealed to be [[King Kong]], arrives and defeats the octopus. Kong then drinks some red berry juice that immediately puts him to sleep. Sakurai and Kinsaburo place Kong on a large raft and begin to transport him back to Japan. Mr. Tako arrives on the ship transporting Kong, but a [[Japan Self Defense Force|JSDF]] ship stops them and orders them to return Kong to Faro Island. Meanwhile, Godzilla arrives in Japan and begins terrorizing the countryside. Kong wakes up and breaks free from the raft. Reaching the mainland, Kong confronts Godzilla and proceeds to throw giant rocks at Godzilla. Godzilla is not fazed by King Kong's rock attack and uses its atomic breath to burn him. Kong retreats after realizing that he is not yet ready to take on Godzilla and its atomic breath.\n\nThe JSDF digs a large pit laden with explosives and poison gas and lures Godzilla into it, but Godzilla is unharmed. They next string up a barrier of power lines around the city filled with 1,000,000 volts of electricity (50,000 volts were tried in the first film, but failed to turn the monster back), which prove effective against Godzilla. Kong then approaches Tokyo and tears through the power lines, feeding off the electricity which seems to make him stronger. Kong then enters Tokyo and captures Fumiko, Sakurai's sister. The JSDF launches capsules full of the Faro Island berry juice in gas form which puts Kong to sleep and are able to rescue Fumiko. The JSDF then decides to transport Kong via balloons to Godzilla, in hopes that they will kill each other.\n\nThe next morning, Kong is dropped next to Godzilla at the summit of [[Mount Fuji]] and the two engage in a final battle. Godzilla initially has the advantage due to its atomic breath and nearly kills Kong. After knocking Kong out with a devastating dropkick and tail smacks to the head, Godzilla begins burning the foliage around Kong trying to cremate him. Suddenly a bolt of lightning from thunder clouds strike King Kong reviving him and charging him up. The monsters continue their fight with the revitalized King Kong beating up Godzilla. Kong continues to throw rocks to attack Godzilla as Godzilla uses its atomic breath to keep Kong at a distance.

This project evolved into ''King Kong vs. Godzilla'' with Godzilla replacing the Frankenstein giant as King Kong's opponent]]\nThe film had its roots in an earlier concept for a new ''King Kong'' feature developed by [[Willis H. O'Brien|Willis O'Brien]], animator of the original stop-motion Kong. Around 1960, O'Brien came up with a proposed treatment, ''King Kong meets Frankenstein'',{{sfn|Cotta Vaz|2005|p=361}} where Kong would fight against a giant version of [[Frankenstein's monster]] in San Francisco.<ref name = B/> O'Brien took the project (which consisted of some concept art<ref>''The 13 Faces of Frankenstein'' by Forrest J Ackerman. ''Famous Monsters of Filmland #39''. Warren Publishing. 1966. Pgs. 58-60</ref> and a screenplay treatment) to [[RKO]] to secure permission to use the King Kong character. During this time the story was renamed ''King Kong vs. the Ginko''<ref>Don Glut. ''The Frankenstein Legend: A Tribute to Mary Shelley and Boris Karloff''. Scarecrow Press, 1973. Pgs. 242-244</ref> when it was believed that Universal had the rights to the Frankenstein name (it actually only had the rights to the monster's makeup design). O'Brien was introduced to producer John Beck, who promised to find a studio to make the film (at this point in time, RKO was no longer a production company). Beck took the story treatment and had [[George Worthing Yates]] flesh it out into a screenplay. The story was slightly altered and the title changed to ''King Kong vs. Prometheus'', returning the name to the original Frankenstein concept (''The Modern Prometheus'' was the alternate name of Frankenstein in the original novel). Unfortunately, the cost of [[stop-motion animation]] discouraged potential studios from putting the film into production. After shopping the script around overseas, Beck eventually attracted the interest of the Japanese studio [[Toho]], which had long wanted to make a ''King Kong'' film and was also planning for [[Godzilla]] to make a comeback around the same time. After purchasing the script, they decided to replace the Frankenstein creature with Godzilla to be King Kong's opponent and would have [[Shinichi Sekizawa]] rewrite Yates's script. The studio thought that it would be the perfect way to celebrate its thirtieth year in production.<ref>Paul A. Woods. ''King Kong Cometh!'' Plexus Publishing Limited, 2005.

They think they will get ahead of their competitors if they use a monster to promote their product.\".{{sfn|Ryfle |1998 |p=82}} Honda would work with screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa on developing the story stating that \"Back then Sekizawa was working on pop songs and TV shows so he really had a clear insight into television\".<ref>Toho Company Limited.

This approach was not favoured by most of the effects crew, who \"couldn't believe\" some of the things Tsuburaya asked them to do, such as Kong and Godzilla volleying a giant boulder back and forth. But Tsuburaya wanted to appeal to children's sensibilities and broaden the genre's audience.{{sfn|Kabushiki|1993|pp=115\u2013123}} This approach was favoured by Toho and to this end, ''King Kong vs. Godzilla'' has a much lighter tone than the previous two ''Godzilla'' films and contains a great deal of humor within the action sequences.

However, some brief stop motion was used in a couple of quick sequences. One of these sequences was animated by Koichi Takano<ref>{{cite web | title=Koichi Takano memoriam on SciFiJapan | url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2008/12/27/koichi-takano-1935-2008/ }}</ref> who was a member of Eiji Tsuburaya's crew.\n\nA brand new Godzilla suit was designed for this film and some slight alterations were done to its overall appearance. These alterations included the removal of its tiny ears, three toes on each foot rather than four, enlarged central dorsal fins and a bulkier body. These new features gave Godzilla a more reptilian/dinosaurian appearance.<ref>Sho Motoyama & Rieko Tsuchiya. ''Godzilla Museum Book''. ASCII Publishing, 1994.</ref> Outside of the suit, a meter high model and a small puppet were also built. Another puppet (from the waist up) was also designed that had a nozzle in the mouth to spray out liquid mist simulating Godzilla's atomic breath. However the shots in the film where this prop was employed (far away shots of Godzilla breathing its atomic breath during its attack on the Arctic Military base) were ultimately cut from the film.{{sfn|Kaneko|Nakajima|1983|p=103}} These cut scenes can be seen in the Japanese theatrical trailer.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=84}} Finally, a separate prop of Godzilla's tail was also built for close up practical shots when its tail would be used (such as the scene where Godzilla trips Kong with its tail). The tail prop would be swung offscreen by a stage hand.{{sfn|Kaneko|Nakajima|1983|p=103}}\n[[File:Oodako.jpg|thumb|left|Eiji Tsuburaya and an octopus wrangler work with a live octopus among the miniature huts.]]\nSadamasa Arikawa (who worked with Eiji Tsuburaya) said that the sculptors had a hard time coming up with a King Kong suit that appeased Tsuburaya.{{sfn|Kabushiki|1993|pp=115\u2013123}} The first suit was rejected for being too fat with long legs giving Kong an almost cute look.{{sfn|Kabushiki|1993|pp=115\u2013123}} A few other designs were done before Tsuburaya would approve the final look that was ultimately used in the film. The suit's body design was a team effort by brothers Koei Yagi and Kanji Yagi. Two separate masks (designed by Teizo Toshimitsu) and two separate pairs of arms were also created. One pair were extended arms that were operated by poles inside the suit to better give Kong a gorilla-like illusion, while the other pair were at normal arms length and featured gloves that were used for scenes that required Kong to grab items and wrestle with Godzilla.<ref>Masami Yamada. ''The Pictorial Book of Godzilla Vol. 2''. Hobby Japan Co, Ltd. 1995. Pgs. 46-47</ref> Besides the suit with the two separate arm attachments, a meter high model and a puppet of Kong (used for closeups) were also built.{{sfn|Kaneko|Nakajima|1983|p=67}}{{sfn|Kishikawa|1994|p=62}} As well, a huge prop of Kong's hand was built for the scene where he grabs Mie Hama (Fumiko) and carries her off.{{sfn|Kishikawa|1994|p=63}}<ref>''We Love Godzilla Everytime Encyclopedia''. Gakken Graphic Books. 1996. Pg. 25.</ref>\n\nFor the attack of the giant octopus, four live octopuses were used. They were forced to move among the miniature huts by having hot air blown onto them. After the filming of that scene was finished, three of the four octopuses were released. The fourth became special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya's dinner. Along with the live animals, two rubber octopus props were built, with the larger one being covered with plastic wrap to simulate mucous. Some stop-motion tentacles were also created for the scene where the octopus grabs a native and tosses him.<ref>Masami Yamada. Pg. 48</ref>\n\nSince King Kong was seen as the bigger draw (at the time, he was even more popular in Japan than Godzilla), and since Godzilla was still a villain at this point in the series, the decision was made to not only give King Kong top billing but also to present him as the winner of the climactic fight. While the ending of the film does look somewhat ambiguous, Toho confirmed that King Kong was indeed the winner in their 1962\u201363 English-language film brochure '''Toho Films Vol. 8''', which states in the film's plot synopsis, ''A spectacular duel is arranged on the summit of Mt. Fuji and King Kong is victorious. But after he has won...''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/h57idBo.jpg|title=Toho Company Limited. ''Toho Films Vol.8''. Toho Publishing Co. Ltd, 1963.

After discussions with Beck, the two wrote the American version and worked with editor [[Peter Zinner]] to remove scenes, recut others, and change the sequence of several events. To give the film more of an American feel, Mason and Howard decided to insert new footage that would convey the impression that the film was actually a newscast. The television actor Michael Keith played newscaster Eric Carter, a [[United Nations]] reporter who spends much of the time commenting on the action from the [[U.N. Headquarters]] via an International Communications Satellite (ICS) broadcast.

In 1970, director Ishiro Honda prepared an edited version of the film for the Toho Champion Festival, a children's matinee program that showcased edited re-releases of older kaiju films along with cartoons and then-new kaiju films. Honda cut twenty-four minutes from the film's [[original camera negative|original negative]], and as a result, the highest quality source for the cut footage was lost. For years all that was thought to remain of the uncut 1962 version was a faded, heavily damaged 16mm element from which rental prints had been made. 1980s restorations for home video integrated the 16mm deleted scenes into the 35mm Champion cut, resulting in wildly inconsistent picture quality.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=86}}\n\nIn 1991, Toho issued a restored laserdisc incorporating the rediscovery of a reel of 35mm trims of the deleted footage. The resultant quality was far superior to previous reconstructions, but not perfect; an abrupt cut caused by missing frames at the beginning or end of a trim is evident whenever the master switches between the Champion cut and a 35mm trim within the same shot. This laserdisc master was utilized for Toho's 2001 DVD release with few changes.<ref name = \"H\"/>\n\nIn 2014, Toho released a new restoration of the film on Blu-Ray, which utilized the 35mm edits once again, but only those available for reels 2-7 of the film were able to be located. The remainder of video for the deleted portions was sourced from the earlier Blu-Ray of the U.S. version, in addition to the previous 480i 1991 laserdisc master.<ref name = \"H\"/> On July 14, 2016, a [[4K resolution|4K]] restoration of a completely 35mm sourced version of the film aired on ''The Godzilla First Impact'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nihon-eiga.com/osusume/shin-godzilla/ |title=Nihon Eiga Senmon Schedule |publisher=nihon-eiga.com |date=May 3, 2016 |accessdate=May 3, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507195019/http://www.nihon-eiga.com/osusume/shin-godzilla/ |archivedate=May 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://amassing2.sakura.ne.jp/image/jacket/large/2016/58810.jpg|title=\"King Kong vs Godzilla\" 4K advertisement |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref> a series of 4K broadcasts of Godzilla films on the Nihon Eiga Senmon Channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://augustragone.blogspot.com/2016/05/4k-reamstering-of-king-kong-vs-godzilla.html |title=4K Remastering Of \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\" Premiering During Satellite Cable Retrospective |date=May 3, 2016 |accessdate=May 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDue to the film's great box office success, Toho planned to do a sequel almost immediately.

In 1963, Kaoru Mabuchi (a.k.a. Takeshi Kimura) wrote a script called ''[[Godzilla vs. Frankenstein|Frankenshutain tai Gojira]]''.<ref name = C/> Ultimately, Toho rejected the script and the next year pitted [[Mothra]] against Godzilla instead, in the 1964 film ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]''. This began an intra-company style crossover where kaiju from other Toho kaiju films would be brought into the Godzilla series.\n\nToho was eager to build a series around their version of King Kong but were refused by RKO.<ref>Ray Morton, ''King Kong: The History of a Movie Icon'', Applause Theater and Cinema Books. 2005. Pgs. 134-135</ref> They worked with the character again in 1967 though, when they helped [[Rankin/Bass]] co produce their film ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'' (which was loosely based on a [[The King Kong Show|cartoon series]] R/B had produced). That film, however, was not a sequel to ''King Kong vs. Godzilla''.\n\nHenry Saperstein (whose company [[United Productions of America|UPA]] co-produced the 1965 film ''Frankenstein Conquers the World'' and the 1966 film ''The War of the Gargantuas'' with Toho) was so impressed with the octopus sequence<ref>''Memories of Ishiro Honda: Twenty years after the passing of Godzilla's famed director'' by Hajime Ishida.

The myth originated in the pages of ''Spacemen'' magazine, a 1960s sister magazine to the influential publication ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]''. In an article about the film, it is incorrectly stated that there were two endings and \"If you see ''King Kong vs Godzilla'' in Japan, Hong Kong or some Oriental sector of the world, Godzilla wins!\"<ref>''Return of Kong'' by Forrest J Ackerman.'' Spacemen #7''. Warren Publishing, 1963. Pgs. 52-56</ref> The article was reprinted in various issues of ''Famous Monsters of Filmland'' in the years following such as issues 51 and 114. This misinformation would be accepted as fact<ref>Ian Thorne. ''Godzilla''. Crestwood House, 1977. Pg.31</ref> and persist for decades. For example, a question in the \"Genus III\" edition of the popular board game ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'' asked, \"Who wins in the Japanese version of ''King Kong vs. Godzilla''?\" and stated that the correct answer was \"Godzilla\". Various media have repeated this falsehood, <ref>{{cite web | title=Bob Costas misreporting dual ending myth | url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuL03iluTdA}}</ref> including the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|pp=87\u201390}} \n\nBut with the rise of home video, Westerners have increasingly been able to view the original version and the myth has been dispelled. The only differences between the two endings of the film are minor:\n\n* In the Japanese version, as Kong and Godzilla are fighting underwater, a very small earthquake occurs. In the American version, producer John Beck used stock footage of a violent earthquake from the film ''[[The Mysterians]]'' to make the climactic earthquake seem far more violent and destructive.\n* The dialogue is slightly different. In the Japanese version onlookers are wondering if Godzilla might be dead or not as they watch Kong swim home and speculate that it is possible he survived. In the American version, onlookers simply say, \"Godzilla has disappeared without a trace\" and newly shot scenes of reporter Eric Carter have him watching Kong swim home on a viewscreen and wishing him luck on his long journey home.\n* As the film ends and the screen fades to black, \"Owari\" (\"The end\") appears on screen. Godzilla's roar followed by Kong's is on the Japanese soundtrack. This was akin to the monsters' taking a bow or saying goodbye to the audience as at this point the film is over. In the American version, only Kong's roar is present on the soundtrack.\n\nIn 1993, comic book artist [[Art Adams|Arthur Adams]] wrote and drew a one-page story that appeared in the anthology ''Urban Legends'' #1, published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], which dispels the popular misconception about the two versions of ''King Kong vs. Godzilla''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Arthur Adams Urban Legends | url=http://comicartistevolution.tumblr.com/post/62572297874/arthur-adams-1993-urban-legends-1-adams-dispels}}</ref>\n<!-- DO NOT INCLUDE Legendary's \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" because it is unrelated to the 1962 film and it is not produced, financed or associated with Toho and their version by any means. -->\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1962]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name = B>Steve Archer.

The film is directed by [[Jun Fukuda]] with special effects by Sadamasa Arikawa with supervision by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] and stars [[Akira Takarada]], [[Kumi Mizuno]], [[Akihiko Hirata]], and [[Eisei Amamoto]], with [[Haruo Nakajima]] as [[Godzilla]] and Hiroshi Sekita as [[Ebirah]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=234}}{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=145}} It is the seventh film in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]] and Sh\u014dwa series. The film was released in Japan on December 17, 1966 and directly to television in the United States in 1968 as ''Godzilla versus the Sea Monster''.\n\n==Plot Summary==\n\nAfter Yata ([[Toru Ibuki]]) is lost at sea, his brother Ryota ([[Toru Watanabe]]) steals a [[yacht]] with his two friends and a bank robber. However, the crew runs afoul of the giant lobster [[Ebirah]] and washes up on the shore of [[List of fictional locations in the Godzilla films |Letchi Island]]. There, a terrorist organization manufactures [[heavy water]] for their purposes, as well as a chemical that keeps Ebirah at bay. The organization, known as the Red Bamboo, has enslaved natives from Infant Island to help them. But the natives hope to awaken [[Mothra]] (now a full-grown moth metamorphosed from the larva that appeared in ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'') to rescue them.\n\nIn their efforts to avoid capture, Ryota and his friends, aided by a beautiful native girl, stumble across [[Godzilla]] sleeping within a cliffside cavern. The group devises a plan to defeat the Red Bamboo and escape from the island. In the process, they wake Godzilla using a makeshift [[lightning rod]]. Godzilla fights Ebirah, but the giant crustacean escapes. Godzilla is then attacked by Daikondoro, a giant [[condor]] and a squadron of Red Bamboo fighter jets, but he destroys them both.\n\nThe humans retrieve the missing Yata and free the enslaved natives as Godzilla begins to destroy the base. Godzilla smashes a tower that has a self-destruct button that makes the island unstable. Godzilla fights Ebirah and defeats it, ripping off both Ebirah's claws and causing it to retreat into the sea. The natives summon Mothra to save everyone. However, Godzilla challenges Mothra when she gets to the island. Mothra manages to push Godzilla away and carry the people off. Godzilla escapes from the island just before it explodes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Akira Takarada]] as Yoshimura\n* Toru Watanabe as Ryota Kane\n* Toru Ibuki as Yata Kane\n* Chotaro Togin as Ichino\n* Hideo Sunazuka as Nita\n* [[Kumi Mizuno]] as Dayo\n* Pair Bambi as [[Mothra]]'s priestesses\n* [[Jun Tazaki]] as Red Bamboo Commander\n* [[Akihiko Hirata]] as Red Bamboo Captain Ryuui\n* [[Hideyo Amamoto]] as Red Bamboo Captain Naval Officer\n* Yutaka Sada as Farmer\n* Hisaya Ito as Red Bamboo Scientist\n* Tadashi Okabe as Red Bamboo Scientist\n* Chieko Nakakita as Mrs. Kane\n* Ikio Sawamura as Elderly Slave\n* [[Shoichi Hirose]] as escaped slave\n* Kazuo Suzuki as escaped slave\n* [[Haruo Nakajima]] as [[Godzilla]]{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=356}}\n* Hiroshi Sekita as [[Ebirah]]{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=356}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{expand section|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe film was originally written as a [[King Kong]] film, titled ''Operation Robinson Crusoe'', but [[Rankin/Bass Productions]] rejected the project; however, Toho proceeded with the project anyway and replaced King Kong with Godzilla (that means fans missed a Kong vs Mothra fight).{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=135}} Despite that Eiji Tsuburaya was given directorial credit for the special effects, Sadamasa Arikawa actually directed the special effects for the film under the supervision of Tsuburaya, who was busy with his own company, Tsuburaya Productions, at the time.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=136}} Toho had decided to set the film on an island in order to cut back on special effects costs.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=133}} Arikawa has cited the film as a frustrating experience, stating, \"There were major limitations on the budget from the studio. Toho couldn't have made too many demands about the budget if Mr. Tsuburaya had been in charge. The studio knew I was also doing TV work then, so they must have figured I could produce the movie cheaply.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=136}}\n\n===Special effects===\nThe underwater sequences were filmed on an indoor soundstage where the Godzilla and Ebirah suits were filmed through the glass of a water-filled aquarium, with some scenes of the Godzilla suit shot separately underwater as well.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=136}} Haruo Nakajima (the suit performer for Godzilla) wore a wet suit under the Godzilla suit for every scene that required him to be in the water, which took a week to complete the water scenes, Nakajima stated, \"I worked overtime until about eight o'clock everyday. Even though I wore a wet suit under the costume, I got cold. But I never got sick, because I was so tense during the filming.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=136}}\n\n===Filming===\nThis is the first ''Godzilla'' film in which an uncharted island is the primary setting rather than a location inside Japan.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Release==\n''Ebirah, Horror of the Deep'' was released theatrically in Japan on December 17, 1966 where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=234}} \n\nThe American version of the film was released directly to television by [[Continental Distributing]] in 1968.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=234}} The title was later changed to ''Godzilla versus the Sea Monster'' which is what was on television and video prints as of 2008.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=234}} The film may have received theatrical distribution in the United States as a Walter Reade, Jr. Presentation, but this has not been confirmed.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=234}}\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] February 8, 2005 by

Monster Island's Decisive Battle: Son of Godzilla}} is a 1967 Japanese [[science fiction]] [[kaiju]] film featuring [[Godzilla]], produced and distributed by [[Toho]]. The film is directed by [[Jun Fukuda]] with special effects by Sadamasa Arikawa with supervision by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] and stars [[Tadao Takashima]], [[Akira Kubo]], [[Akihiko Hirata]], and Beverly Maeda, with Hiroshi Sekita, Seiji Onaka, and [[Haruo Nakajima]] as Godzilla and Marchan the Dwarf as Minilla.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=169}} The film was released in Japan on December 16, 1967 and released directly to television in the United States in 1969 through the Walter Reade Organization.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=143}}\n\n==Plot==\nA team of scientists are trying to perfect a weather-controlling system. Their efforts are hampered by the arrival of a nosy reporter and by the sudden presence of 2-meter tall giant [[praying mantis]]es. The first test of the weather control system goes awry when the remote control for a radioactive balloon is jammed by an unexplained signal coming from the center of the island. The balloon detonates prematurely, creating a radioactive storm that causes the giant mantises to grow to enormous sizes. Investigating the mantises, which are named [[Kamacuras]] (Gimantis in the English-dubbed version), the scientists find the monstrous insects digging an egg out from under a pile of earth. The egg hatches, revealing a baby Godzilla. The scientists realize that the baby's telepathic cries for help were the cause of the interference that ruined their experiment. Shortly afterwards, [[Godzilla]] arrives on the island in response to the infant's cries, demolishing the scientist's base while rushing to defend the baby. Godzilla kills two of the Kamacuras during the battle while one manages to fly away to safety, Godzilla then adopts the baby.\n\nThe baby Godzilla, named [[Minilla]], quickly grows to about half the size of the adult Godzilla and Godzilla instructs him on the important monster skills of roaring and using its atomic ray. At first, Minilla has difficulty producing anything more than atomic smoke rings, but Godzilla discovers that stressful conditions (i.e. stomping on his tail) or motivation produces a true radioactive blast. Minilla comes to the aid of Saeko when she is attacked by a Kamacuras, but inadvertently awakens [[Kumonga]] (Spiga in the English-dubbed version), a giant spider that was sleeping in a valley. Kumonga attacks the caves where the scientists are hiding and Minilla stumbles into the fray.\n\nKumonga traps Minilla and the final Kamacuras with its webbing, but as Kumonga begins to feed on the deceased Kamacuras, Godzilla arrives. Godzilla saves Minilla and they work together to defeat Kumonga by using their atomic rays on the giant spider. Hoping to keep the monsters from interfering in their attempt to escape the island, the scientists finally use their perfected weather altering device on the island and the once tropical island becomes buried in snow and ice. As the scientists are saved by an American submarine, Godzilla and Minilla begin to hibernate as they wait for the island to become tropical again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Akira Kubo]] as Maki Goro\n* [[Tadao Takashima]] as Professor Kusumi\n* Beverly Maeda as Saeko Matsumiya\n* [[Akihiko Hirata]] as Fujisaki\n* [[Yoshio Tsuchiya]] as Furukawa\n* [[Kenji Sahara]] as Morio\n* Kenichiro Maruyama as Ozawa\n* Seishiro Kuno as Tashiro\n* Hiroshi Sekita, Seiji Onaka, and [[Haruo Nakajima]] as [[Godzilla]]{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=357}}\n* Marchan the Dwarf as [[Minilla]]{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=357}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:sonofG.jpg|thumb|Sadamasa Arikawa gives instructions to Marchan the Dwarf (Minilla). \"Marchan the Dwarf\" was hired to play the character partially for his ability to perform athletic rolls and flips inside the thick rubber suit.]]\n\nFor the second ''Godzilla'' film in a row, Toho produced an island themed adventure with a smaller budget than most of their monster films from this time period.{{sfn|Kabushiki|1993|p=62}} While the a-list crew of talent was hired to work on that year's ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'', ([[Ishiro Honda]], [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], and [[Akira Ifukube]]), the second string crew of cheaper talent was once again tapped to work on this project as they had done with ''[[Ebirah, Horror of the Deep]]''. This included [[Jun Fukuda]] (director), Sadamasa Arikawa (special effects), and Masaru Sato (composer).  This was the first film where Arikawa was officially listed as the director of Special Effects,{{sfn|Kabushiki|1993|p=63}} although he did receive some supervision from Tsuburaya when he was available.{{sfn|Kabushiki|1993|p=63}}\n\nToho wanted to create a baby Godzilla to appeal to the \"date crowd\" (a genre of films that were very popular among young couples during this time period), with the idea that girls would like a \"cute\" baby monster.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Complete Godzilla Chronology 1954-2004|first1=August|last1=Ragone|first2=Bob|last2=Eggleton|magazine=[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]|issue=274|publisher=Movieland Classics LLC.|date=2014|page=23}}</ref> For the idea behind [[Minilla]], Fukuda stated, \"We wanted to take a new approach, so we gave Godzilla a child. We thought it would be a little strange if we gave Godzilla a daughter, so instead we gave him a son\".{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=141}} Fukuda also wanted to portray the monsters almost as people<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Twenty-five Years with Godzilla|first=Ed|last=Godziszewski|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|issue=1|publisher=O'Quinn Studios Inc|date=1979|page=38}}</ref> in regards to the father-son relationship between Godzilla and Minilla, as Fukuda stated \"We focused on the relationship between Godzilla and his son throughout the course of ''Son of Godzilla''.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=141}}\n\nMinilla was designed to incorporate features of not only a baby Godzilla but a human baby was well.{{sfn|Kabushiki|1993|p=64}} \"Marchan the Dwarf\" was hired to play the character due to his ability to play-act and to give the character a childlike ambiance. He was also hired because of his ability to perform athletic rolls and flips inside the thick rubber suit.{{sfn|Kabushiki|1993|p=64}}\n\nThe Godzilla suit built for this film was the biggest in terms of size and girth.{{sfn|Kaneko|Nakajima|1983|p=101}}  This was done in order to give Godzilla a \"maternal\" appearance and to give a parent-like stature in contrast next to Minilla.{{sfn|Kabushiki|1993|p=64}} Because of the size of the suit, seasoned Godzilla suit actor [[Haruo Nakajima]] was only hired to play Godzilla in two scenes because the suit was much too big for him to wear.<ref>''Haruo Nakajima Monster Photo Book''(\u4e2d\u5cf6\u6625\u96c4\u602a\u7363\u5199\u771f\u96c6).

The various giant preying mantises known as [[Kamacuras]] and the huge poisonous spider [[Kumonga]].{{sfn|Kaneko|Nakajima|1983|p=76}}{{sfn|Kaneko|Nakajima|1983|p=77}}   Arikawa would usually have 20

distributed by [[Toho]]. The film is directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]], with special effects by Sadamasa Arikawa with supervision by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] and stars [[Akira Kubo]], [[Jun Tazaki]], Yukiko Kobayashi and [[Yoshio Tsuchiya]]. It is the 9th entry in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]] and Sh\u014dwa series.\n\nThe film story features aliens known as Kilaaks, who have released the giant monsters from Monsterland and have planted mind-control devices on the monsters to control them. The monsters are eventually freed from the mind control, which leads the aliens to release [[King Ghidorah]] from space to challenge them.\n\nThe film was written by Honda and [[Takeshi Kimura]] who introduced the concept of [[Monsterland and Monster Island|Monster Island]] into the ''Godzilla'' film series. The film featured some complete new costumes for monsters such as Godzilla and some that were altered since their appearance in previous films. The film was released in Japan on August 1, 1968.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the close of the 20th century, all of the Earth's [[kaiju]] have been collected by the [[United Nations]] Science Committee and confined in an area known as [[Monsterland and Monster Island|Monsterland]], located in the [[Ogasawara Islands|Ogasawara island chain]]. A special control center is constructed underneath the island to ensure that the monsters stay secure and to serve as a research facility to study them.\n\nWhen communications with Monsterland are suddenly and mysteriously severed, and all of the monsters begin attacking world capitals, Dr. Yoshida of the UNSC orders Captain Yamabe and the crew of his spaceship, Moonlight SY-3, to investigate Ogasawara. There, they discover that the scientists, led by Dr. Otani, have become mind-controlled slaves of a feminine alien race identifying themselves as the [[List of Toho alien races#Kilaakians|Kilaaks]], who reveal that they are in control of the monsters. Their leader demands that the human race surrender, or face total annihilation.\n\n[[Godzilla]] attacks [[New York City]], [[Rodan]] invades [[Moscow]], [[Mothra]] (a larva offspring) lays waste to [[Beijing]], [[Gorosaurus]] destroys [[Paris]], and [[Manda (kaiju)|Manda]] attacks [[London]]. These attacks were set in to motion to draw attention away from Japan, so that the aliens can establish an underground stronghold near [[Mt. Fuji]] in Japan. The Kilaaks then turn their next major attack on to Tokyo and, without serious opposition, become arrogant in their aims until the UNSC discover, after recovering the Kilaaks' monster mind-control devices from around the world, that they have switched to broadcasting the control signals from their base under the Moon's surface. In a desperate battle, the crew of the SY-3 destroys the Kilaak's lunar outpost and returns the alien control system to Earth.\n\nWith all of the monsters under the control of the UNSC, the Kilaaks unleash their hidden weapon, [[King Ghidorah]]. The three-headed space monster is dispatched to protect the alien stronghold at Mt. Fuji, and battles [[Godzilla]], [[Minilla]], [[Mothra]], [[Rodan]], [[Gorosaurus]], [[Anguirus]], and [[Kumonga]]. While seemingly invincible, King Ghidorah is eventually overpowered by the combined strength of the Earth monsters and is killed. Refusing to admit defeat, the Kilaaks produce their trump card, a burning monster they call the Fire Dragon, which begins to torch Tokyo and destroys the control center on Ogasawara. Suddenly, Godzilla attacks and destroys the Kilaak's underground base, revealing that the Earth's monsters instinctively know who their enemies are. Captain Yamabe then pursues the Fire Dragon in the SY-3 and narrowly achieves victory for the human race. The Fire Dragon is revealed to be a flaming Kilaak saucer and is destroyed. [[Godzilla]] and the other monsters eventually return to [[Monsterland and Monster Island|Monsterland]] to live in peace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Akira Kubo]] as Captain Katsuo Yamabe\n* [[Jun Tazaki]] as

It is the 13th film in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]] and Sh\u014dwa series.\n\nThe film was released in Japan on March 17, 1973 and theatrically in the United States in the summer of 1976 by [[Cinema Shares]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Jet Jaguar.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Jet Jaguar as featured in the film.]]\nIn the first part of 1971 (197X in the Japanese version), the most recent underground nuclear test, set off near the [[Aleutians]], sends shockwaves as far across the globe as Monster Island in the South Pacific, disturbing monsters such as [[Godzilla]], [[Anguirus]], and [[Rodan]].\n\nFor years, Seatopia, an undersea civilization, has been heavily affected by this nuclear testing conducted by the surface nations of the world.  Upset by these tests, the Seatopians plan to unleash their civilization's beetle-like [[cyborg]] god, [[Megalon]], to destroy the surface world out of vengeance.\n\nOn the surface, an inventor named Goro Ibuki, his nephew Rokuro, and Goro's friend Hiroshi Jinkawa are off on an outing near a lake when Seatopia makes itself known to the Earth by drying up the lake the trio was relaxing nearby and using it as a base of operation. As they return home they are ambushed by agents of Seatopia who are trying to steal [[Jet Jaguar]], a humanoid robot under construction by the trio of inventors. However the agents' first attempt is botched and they are forced to flee to safety.\n\nSome time later, Jet Jaguar is completed but the trio of inventors are knocked unconscious by the returning Seatopian agents. The agents' plan is to use Jet Jaguar to guide and direct Megalon to destroy whatever city Seatopia commands it to do. Goro and Rokuro are sent to be killed, while Hiroshi is taken hostage. Megalon is finally released to the surface while Jet Jaguar is put under the control of the Seatopians and is used to guide Megalon to attack Tokyo with the [[Japan Self Defense Forces]] failing to defeat the monster. Eventually, the trio of heroes manage to escape their situation with the Seatopians and reunite to devise a plan to send Jet Jaguar to get Godzilla's help using Jet Jaguar's secondary control system.\n\nAfter uniting with Japan's Defense Force, Goro manages to regain control of Jet Jaguar and sends the robot to Monster Island to bring Godzilla to fight Megalon. Without a guide to control its actions, Megalon flails around relentlessly and aimlessly fighting with the Defense Force and destroying the outskirts of Tokyo. The Seatopians learn of Jet Jaguar's turn and thus send out a distress call to the Space Hunter Nebula M aliens ([[Godzilla vs. Gigan|from the previous film]]) to send [[Gigan]] to assist them.\n\nAs Godzilla journeys to fight Megalon, Jet Jaguar programs into a safeguard mode and grows to gigantic proportions to face Megalon itself until Godzilla arrives. The battle is roughly at a standstill between robot and cyborg, until Gigan arrives and both Megalon and Gigan double team against Jet Jaguar. Godzilla finally arrives to assist Jet Jaguar and the odds become even. After a long and brutal fight, Gigan and Megalon both retreat and Godzilla and Jet Jaguar shake hands on a job well done. Godzilla returns to Monster Island, and Jet Jaguar returns to its previous human-sized state and reunites with its inventors.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Katsuhiko Sasaki]] as Inventor Goro Ibuki\n* Hiroyuki Kawase as Rokuro 'Roku-chan' Ibuki\n* Yutaka Hayashi as Hiroshi Jinkawa\n* [[Robert Dunham]] as Emperor Antonio of Seatopia\n* Kotaro Tomita as Lead Seatopian Agent\n* Wolf Ohtsuki as Seatopian Agent\n* Gentaro Nakajima as Truck Driver \n* Sakyo Mikami as Truck Driver's Assistant\n* Shinji Takagi as [[Godzilla]]\n* Hideto Date as [[Megalon]]\n* Tsugutoshi Komada as Jet Jaguar\n* [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]] as [[Gigan]]\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' was originally planned as a non-''Godzilla'' film, a solo vehicle for Jet Jaguar, which was the result of a contest Toho had for children in mid-to-late 1972. The winner of the contest was an elementary school student, who submitted the drawing of a robot called Red Aron. Red Aron was turned into a monster suit but when the child was shown the suit, he became upset because the suit did not resemble his original design. The boy's original design was white but the costume was colored red, blue, and yellow. Red Aron was used for publicity but Toho had renamed the character as Jet Jaguar and had special effects director Teruyoshi Nakano redesign the character, only keeping the colors from the Red Aron suit. The Red Aron suit had a different head and wings.{{Full citation needed|date=June 2018}}<ref name=\"commentary\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv6nbZAoOQM Audio Commentary by Steve Ryfle & Stuart Galbraith IV - Media Blasters Recalled 2012 DVD Release]</ref> {{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=182}}\n\nHowever, after doing some screen tests and storyboards, Toho figured Jet Jaguar would not be able to carry the film on his own, either in screen appearance or marketing value, so they shut the project down during pre-production. Nearly a month later, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka called in screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa to revise the script to add Godzilla and Gigan. To make up for lost production time, the film was shot in a hasty three weeks. The production time totaled at nearly six months, from planning to finish.\n\nThe film had three early treatments, each written by [[Shinichi Sekizawa]], one was titled ''Godzilla vs. The Megalon Brothers: The Undersea Kingdom's Annihilation Strategy'' which was completed in September 1972. The second was titled ''Insect Monster Megalon vs. Godzilla: Undersea Kingdom's Annihilation Strategy'', which was turned in on September 5, 1972, and the third draft was submitted in September 7, 1972.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n===Creature design===\nAccording to Teruyoshi Nakano, the Godzilla suit used in this film (nicknamed the \"Megaro-Goji\" suit) was made in a week, making it the fastest Godzilla suit ever made to date. They did not have time to make the eyes work correctly, something they had more time to fix for Godzilla's five appearances on Toho's superhero TV series ''[[Zone Fighter]]'' (1973), which was produced around the same time.\n\nThe [[Megalon]] suit was one of the heaviest suits produced since the 1954 ''Godzilla'' suit, which made it even more difficult to raise the Megalon suit via wires in certain scenes up to the point where Nakano almost decided to scrap those scenes all together. Since the film was shot in the winter, [[Katsuhiko Sasaki]] stated that director [[Jun Fukuda]] gave him and Yutaka Hayashi a shot of whiskey to warm them up.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nThe Gigan suit is similar to the previous design, but the suit was made thinner, less bulky, the horn on the head was less pointed, and the buzzsaw didn't move, since it was made of static pieces. This suit also has different-sized back fins, a more circular visor, scales running up the back/sides of the neck and longer legs compared to the original version.\n\nTeruyoshi Nakano recalls how the film was rushed and that it took three weeks to shoot, stating, \"It went into productions without enough preparation. There was no time to ask Mr. Sekizawa to write the script, so Mr. Sekizawa kind of thought up the general story and director Fukuda wrote the screenplay. The screenplay was completed right before crank-in\".{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=183}}\n\n===Filming===\nLike previous Godzilla films, ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' heavily employs stock footage from previous Toho Godzilla films such as ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'' (1964), ''[[The War of the Gargantuas]]'' (1966), ''[[Ebirah, Horror of the Deep]]'' (1966), ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]'' (1968), ''[[Godzilla vs. Hedorah]]'' (1971), and ''[[Godzilla vs. Gigan]]'' (1972).{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=183}}\n\n==English versions==\n[[Image:Godzilla-megalon-us.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Cinema Shares theatrical poster for the 1976 U.S release of ''Godzilla vs. Megalon''. The poster (which spoofs the theatrical poster for ''[[King Kong (1976)|King Kong]]'') incorrectly places the monsters in a World Trade Center-based battle.]]\n\nIn 1976, [[Cinema Shares]] gave ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' a wide theatrical release in the United States and launched a massive marketing campaign for the film, along with the poster, buttons with one of the four monsters' faces on them were released. Given away at theatrical showings was a comic that told a simplified version of the film, which incorrectly named Jet Jaguar as \"Robotman\" and Gigan as \"Borodan\". These incorrect names were also featured in the US trailer.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=183}}\n\nInitially, Cinema Shares screened Toho's international English version but to ensure a G-rating, several cuts were made, which resulted in the film running three minutes shorter than the original version.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=183}}\n\n''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' is the first Godzilla film to receive an American prime time network television premiere, where it was broadcast nationwide at 9:00 PM on NBC on March 15, 1977. However, to accommodate commercials, the film was only shown in a one-hour time slot, which resulted in the film to be cut down to 48 minutes. [[John Belushi]] hosted the broadcast where he did some skits, all in a Godzilla suit.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nMel Maron (who was president of Cinema Shares at the time) chose to release ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' because he saw Godzilla as a heroic figure by that point and felt the timing was right to show children a hero who was a friendly monster and not [[Superman]].<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nThe U.S. rights for the film eventually fell into public domain in the late 1980s, which resulted in companies releasing poorly cropped, fullscreen VHS tapes mastered from [[pan and scan]] sources.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=184}}  This also led to the film being featured in ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nIn Japan, ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' sold approximately 980,000 tickets. It was the first ''Godzilla'' film to sell less than one million admissions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tohokingdom.com/box_office/godzilla_vs_megalon.htm |title=Godzilla vs. Megalon |publisher=Tohokingdom.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref> The film was a success in American theaters, earning $383,744 in its first three days in Texas and Louisiana alone.<ref>''The Hollywood Reporter''.

''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[Vincent Canby]], who a decade before had given a negative review to ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', gave ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' a generally positive review. In his review on July 12, 1976, Canby said, \"''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' completes the canonization of Godzilla...It's been a remarkable transformation of character - the dragon has become St. George...It's wildly preposterous, imaginative and funny (often intentionally). It demonstrates the rewards of friendship, between humans as well as monsters, and it is gentle.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/22/archives/another-godzilla-movie-monster-is-now-a-good-guy.html|title=Another \u2018Godzilla\u2019 Movie|last=Can|first=Vincent|date=1976-07-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' has attracted the ire of many ''Godzilla'' fans in the decades since its original release. The film contributed to the reputation of ''Godzilla'' films in the United States as cheap children's entertainment that should not be taken seriously.<ref name=\"Toho Kingdom\">{{cite web|url= http://www.tohokingdom.com/web_pages/m_reviews/anthony_r/godzilla_vs_megalon.htm|title=Toho Kingdom; ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' review|author=Anthony Romero}}</ref><ref name=\"Stomp Tokyo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/g/godzilla-vs-megalon.html|title=Stomp Tokyo- ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' review|author=Chris Holland & Scott Hamilton}}</ref> It's been described as \"incredibly, undeniably, mind-numbingly bad\"<ref name=\"Barry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.godzillatemple.com/movie13.htm|title=Review at \"Barry's Temple of Godzilla\"}}</ref> and one of the \"poorer moments\" in the history of kaiju films.<ref name=\"Stomp Tokyo\"/>\n\nIn particular, the [[special effects]] of the film have been heavily criticized. One review described the Godzilla costume as appearing to be \"crossed with [[Kermit the Frog]]\"<ref name=\"Stomp Tokyo\"/> and another sneeringly compared it to ''[[Godzilla vs. Gigan]]'', stating that it did \"''everything wrong that [[Gigan]] did, and then some.''\" However, most of the criticism is of the lack of actual special effects work, as most of it consists of [[stock footage]] from previous films, including ''Godzilla vs. Gigan'' and ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', and a few pieces of effects work has garnered praise, specifically a scene where Megalon breaks through a dam and the draining of the lake.<ref name=\"Toho Kingdom\"/>\n\nThe other aspects of the film have been similarly skewered. The acting is usually described as flat and generally poor, and as not improving, or sometimes, worsening, the already weak script.<ref name=\"Toho Kingdom\"/> One part of the film, on the other hand, has garnered almost universal praise: Godzilla's final attack on Megalon, a flying kick. It has been called the saving grace of the film,<ref name=\"Barry\"/> and was made famous by the mock exclamations of shock and awe displayed on ''Godzilla vs. Megalon''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s appearance on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. Through the end of season three to the middle of season five, that clip would be shown at the opening of each show.\n\nDespite all this, the film is also one of the most widely seen ''Godzilla ''films in the United States \u2014 it was popular in its initial theatrical release, largely due to an aggressive marketing campaign, including elaborate posters of the two title monsters battling atop [[New York City]]'s [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers, presumably to capitalize on the hype surrounding the Dino De Laurentiis remake of ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'', which used a similar image for its own poster.<ref name=\"Toho Kingdom\"/>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released numerous times in the [[VHS]] format, mostly as videos from bargain basement studios that featured the edited TV version (which was wrongly assumed to be in the [[public domain]] for many years). [[Media Blasters]] acquired the [[DVD]] rights to both ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' and ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]''. Both films were released under one of the company's divisions, [[Tokyo Shock]]. Media Blasters originally planned to release ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] on December 20, 2011; however, due to technical difficulties with the dubbing and Toho having yet to give its approval for the release, the DVD/Blu-ray release was delayed.<ref>[http://famousmonstersoffilmland.com/2012/01/19/godzilla-vs-megalon-bludvd-release-delayed/ Famous Monsters of Filmland: \"\u201cGODZILLA VS MEGALON\u201d Blu/DVD Release Delayed\", January 19, 2012.]</ref> Media Blasters finally released the film on August 14, 2012, but only on a bare-bones DVD and Blu-ray.

Mihara]], the monster's cells are delivered to the Saradia Institute of Technology and Science, where they are to be merged with [[genetically modified plants]] in the hope of transforming Saradia's deserts into fertile land and ending the country's economic dependence on oil wells. Dr. Genshiro Shiragami and his daughter, Erika, are enlisted to aid with the project. However, a terrorist bombing destroys the institute's laboratory, ruining the cells and killing Erika.\n\nFive years later, Shiragami has returned to Japan and merged some of Erika's cells with those of a [[rose]] in an attempt to preserve her soul. Scientist Kazuhito Kirishima and Lieutenant Goro Gondo of the [[JSDF]] are using the Godzilla cells they collected to create \"Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria\", hoping it can serve as a weapon against Godzilla should it return. They attempt to recruit Shiragami to aid them, but are rebuffed. International tensions increase over the Godzilla cells, as they are coveted by both the Saradia Institute of Technology and Science and the American Bio-Major organization. An explosion from Mt. Mihara causes tremors across the area, including Shiragami's home, badly damaging the roses. Shiragami agrees to join the JSDF's effort and is given access to the Godzilla cells, which he secretly merges with one of the roses. A night later, rival Bio-Major and Saradian agents break into Shiragami's lab, but are attacked by a large plant-like creature which later escapes to [[Lake Ashino]] and is named \"[[Biollante]]\" by Shiragami.\n\nBio-Major agents plant explosives around Mt. Mihara and issue an ultimatum to the [[Diet of Japan]], warning that the explosives will be detonated and thus free Godzilla if the cells aren't handed over. Kirishima and Gondo attempt to trade, but Saradian agent SSS9 thwarts the attempt and escapes with the cells. The explosives are detonated, and Godzilla is released. It attempts to reach the nearest power plant to replenish its supply of nuclear energy, but Biollante calls out to it. Godzilla arrives at the lake to engage Biollante in a vicious battle, and emerges as the victor. Godzilla proceeds toward the power plant at [[Tsuruga]], but psychic [[Miki Saegusa]] uses her powers to divert it toward [[Osaka]] instead. A team led by Gondo meet Godzilla at the central district and fire rockets infused with the anti-nuclear bacteria into its body. Gondo is killed in the process, and an unaffected Godzilla leaves the city.\n\nKirishima recovers the cells and returns them to the JSDF. Shiragami theorizes that if Godzilla's body temperature is increased, the bacteria should work against it. The JSDF erects microwave-emitting plates during an artificial thunderstorm, hitting Godzilla with lightning and heating up its body temperature during a battle in the mountains outside Osaka. Godzilla is only moderately affected, but Biollante arrives to engage it in battle once again. The fight ends after Godzilla fires its atomic heat ray inside Biollante's mouth. An exhausted Godzilla collapses on the beach, and Biollante disintegrates into the sky, forming an image of Erika amongst the stars. Shiragami, watching the scene, is killed by SSS9. Kirishima chases the assassin and, after a brief scuffle, SSS9 is killed by a microwave-emitting plate. Godzilla reawakens and leaves for the ocean.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kunihiko Mitamura]] as {{nihongo|Kazuhito Kirishima|\u6850\u5cf6 \u4e00\u4eba| Kirishima Kazuhito}}\n* [[Yoshiko Tanaka]] as {{nihongo|Asuka Okochi|\u5927\u6cb3\u5185 \u660e\u65e5\u9999 | Okochi Asuka}}\n* [[Masanobu Takashima]] as {{nihongo|Major Sho Kuroki|\u9ed2\u6728 \u7fd4 | Kuroki Sh\u014d}}\n* [[Megumi Odaka]] as {{nihongo|[[Miki Saegusa]]|\u4e09\u679d \u672a\u5e0c | Saegusa Miki}}\n* [[K\u014dji Takahashi]] as {{nihongo|Dr. Genichiro Shiragami|\u767d\u795e \u6e90\u58f1\u90ce| Shiragami Gen'ichir\u014d}}\n* Toru Minegishi as {{nihongo|Col.

He relented after the success of ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', and proceeded to hold a public story contest for a possible script.<ref name=\"kalat2010\">Kalat, D.

The scientist's initial experiments would have resulted in the creation of a giant rat-like amphibian called Deutalios, which would have landed in Tokyo Bay and been killed by Godzilla. A female reporter investigating the scientist's activities would have suffered from psychic visions of plants with humanoid faces compelling her to infiltrate the scientist's laboratory.

The model required 32 wires to operate<ref name=\"kalat2010\"/>]]\n[[Koichi Kawakita]], who had previously worked for [[Tsuburaya Productions]], replaced [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] as head of the series' special effects unit after Toho became impressed at his work in ''[[Gunhed (film)|Gunhed]]''. Kawakita made use of ''Gunhead'''s special effects team Studio OX, and initially wanted to make Godzilla more animal-like, using crocodiles as references, but was berated by Tanaka, who declared Godzilla to be \"a monster\" rather than an animal. [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]] returned to portray Godzilla, hoping to improve his performance by making it less anthropomorphic than in previous films. Suitmaker Noboyuki Yasamaru created a Godzilla suit made specifically with Satsuma's measurements in mind, unlike the previous one which was initially built for another performer and caused Satsuma discomfort. The resulting 242 lb suit proved more comfortable than the last, having a lower center of gravity and more mobile legs. A second 176 lb suit was built for outdoor underwater scenes. The head's size was reduced, and the whites around the eyes removed. On the advice of story finalist Shinichiro Kobayashi, a double row of teeth was incorporated in the jaws. As with the previous film, animatronic models were used for close-up shots. These models were an improvement over the last, as they were made from the same molds used for the main costume, and included an articulated tongue and intricate eye motion. The suit's dorsal plates were filled with light bulbs for scenes in which Godzilla uses his atomic ray, thus lessening reliance on optical animation, though they electrocuted Satsuma the first time they were activated. Satsuma was also obliged to wear protective goggles when in the suit during scenes in which Godzilla battles the JSDF, as real explosives were used on set.<ref name=\"kalat2010\"/>\n\nDesigning and building the Biollante props proved problematic, as traditional suitmation techniques made realizing the requested design of the creature's first form difficult, and the resulting cumbersome model for Biollante's final form was met with disbelief from the special effects team. Biollante's first form was performed by Masao Takegami, who sat within the model's trunk area on a platform just above water level. While the creature's head movements were simple to operate, its vines were controlled by an intricate array of overhead wires which proved difficult for Satsuma to react to during combat scenes as they offered no tension, thus warranting Satsuma to feign receiving blows from them, despite not being able to perceive them. Biollante's final form was even more difficult to operate, as its vine network took hours to rig up on set. Visibility in both the Godzilla and final form Biollante suits was poor, thus causing difficulties for Takegami in aiming the creature's head when firing sap, which permanently stained anything it landed on.<ref name=\"kalat2010\"/>\n\nWhile it was initially decided to incorporate [[stop motion animation]] into the film, the resulting sequences were scrapped, as Kawakita felt they failed to blend in with the live-action footage effectively. The film however became the first of its kind to use [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], though its usage was limited to scenes involving computer generated schematics.<ref name=\"kalat2010\"/> The original cut of the movie had the first battle culminating in Biollante's spores falling around the hills surrounding Lake Ashino and blooming into fields of flowers, though this was removed as the flowers were out of scale.<ref name=\"ryfle1998\"/>\n\n===Music===\nUnlike the previous film, ''Godzilla vs. Biollante'' incorporates themes from [[Akira Ifukube]]'s original ''Gojira'' theme, though the majority of the soundtrack was composed of original themes by [[Koichi Sugiyama]]. The score was orchestrated by conductor David Howell through the Kansai Philarmonic, though Howell himself had never viewed the movie, and thus was left to interpret what the scenes would consist of when conducting the orchestra.<ref name=\"kalat2010\"/>\n\n==English version==\nAfter the film was released in Japan, Toho commissioned a Hong Kong company named Omni Productions to dub the film into English.<ref name=\"Ryfle1998\">{{cite book|author=Steve Ryfle|title=Japan's Favorite Mon-star: The Unauthorized Biography of \"The Big G\"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqSOkywWeX4C|year=1998|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-348-4}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1990, Toho entered discussions with Miramax to distribute the film. When talks broke off, Toho filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Federal Court, accusing Miramax of entering an oral agreement in June to pay Toho $500,000 to distribute the film. This lawsuit delayed the film's release for two years. An out of court settlement was reached with Miramax buying the rights to the film for an unreported figure. Miramax would have entertained thoughts of releasing the film in theaters, but in the end it was decided to release the film straight to home video instead. HBO released the film on VHS in 1992 and Laserdisc in 1993.

The film is directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]], with special effects by [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] and stars [[Katsuhiko Sasaki]], Tomoko Ai, [[Akihiko Hirata]], and [[Gor\u014d Mutsumi]], with [[Toru Kawai]] as Godzilla, Ise Mori as [[Mechagodzilla]], and [[Tatsumi Nikamoto]] as [[Titanosaurus]]. It is the 15th film in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]] and the final film in the Sh\u014dwa series, and serves as a direct sequel to 1974's ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]''. The film was the least successful of the entire [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla franchise]].\n\nThe film was released in Japan on March 15, 1975 and received a limited theatrical release in the United States in 1978 by Bob Conn Enterprises as ''The Terror of Godzilla''.\n\n==Plot==\nContinuing after the end of the events of ''Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla'',  [[Interpol]] agents, led by Inspector Kusaka, search for the pieces of [[Mechagodzilla]] at the bottom of the Okinawan Sea. Using the submarine, ''Akatsuki'', they hope to gather information on the robot's builders, the alien Simeons. The ''Akatsuki'' is suddenly attacked by a giant aquatic [[dinosaur]] called [[Titanosaurus (Godzilla)|Titanosaurus]] and the crew vanishes.\n\nInterpol starts an investigation into the incident. With the help of [[marine biologist]] Akira Ichinose, they trace Titanosaurus to a reclusive, mad scientist named Shinz\u00f4 Mafune, who wants to destroy all mankind. While Ichinose is visiting his old home in the seaside forest of [[Manazuru, Kanagawa|Manazuru]], they meet Mafune's lone daughter, Katsura. She tells them that not only is her father dead, but she burned all of the notes about the giant dinosaur (at her father's request). Unknownst to them, Mafune is still alive and well. He is visited by his friend Tsuda, who is an aide to the alien leader Mugal. He is leading the project to quickly rebuild Mechagodzilla. Mugal offers their services to Mafune, so that his Titanosaurus and their Mechagodzilla 2 will be the ultimate weapons. They hope to wipe out mankind and rebuild the world for themselves, starting with [[Tokyo]] and branching out from there.\n\nBut things are complicated for both factions when Ichinose falls in love with Katsura and unwittingly gives her Interpol's information against Titanosaurus, the new Mechagodzilla and the aliens. It is also discovered that Katsura is actually a cyborg, due to undergoing surgery, and Mugal still has uses for her. Meanwhile, Mafune is desperate to unleash Titanosaurus without the aliens' permission, so he releases it on [[Yokosuka]] one night. By then, Interpol discovers that supersonic waves are Titanosaurus' weakness. They have a supersonic wave oscillator ready, but Katsura sabotages the machine before they can use it. Fortunately, [[Godzilla]] arrives to fight off Titanosaurus.\n\nLater, when Ichinose visits Katsura, he is captured by the aliens. Tied up, Ichinose can only watch as Mafune and the aliens unleash Mechagodzilla 2 and Titanosaurus on Tokyo, while Interpol struggles to repair their supersonic wave oscillator and the Japanese armed forces struggle to keep the two monsters at bay. Katsura, while being controlled by Mugal, ignores Ichinose's pleas and controls both the dinosaur and the robot as they destroy the city.\n\nGodzilla comes to the rescue, although he is outmatched by the two titans. While Interpol distracts Titanosaurus with the supersonic wave oscillator, Godzilla is able to focus on attacking Mechagodzilla 2. Interpol agents infiltrate the aliens' hideout, rescue Ichinose, and kill Mafune and many of the aliens. The remaining aliens attempt to escape in their ships, but Godzilla shoots them down with his atomic heat ray. Katsura, while being embraced by Ichinose, [[altruistic suicide|shoots herself]] to destroy Mechagodzilla 2's control device (which had been implanted in her body by the aliens). This helps Godzilla destroy the robot. Godzilla, with the help of the oscillator, defeats Titanosaurus and heads back to sea.\n\n==Cast==\n\n*[[Katsuhiko Sasaki]] as Akira Ichinose\n*Tomoko Ai as Katsura Mafune\n*[[Akihiko Hirata]] as Dr. Shinji Mafune\n*[[Katsumasa Uchida]] as Jiro Murakoshi, Interpol Agent\n*Goro Mutusmi as Mugal, Black Hole Alien leader\n*Toru Ibuki as Tsuda, Black Hole Alien lieutenant\n*[[Kenji Sahara]] as General Segawa\n*Tadao Nakamaru as Chief of Interpol Tagawa\n*Akinori Umezu as boy #1\n*[[Toru Kawai]] as [[Godzilla]]{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=361}}\n* Ise Mori as [[Mechagodzilla]]{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=361}}\n*[[Tatsumi Nikamoto|Tatsumi Fuyamoto]] as [[Titanosaurus (Godzilla)|Titanosaurus]]{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=361}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:tomg shinto ceremony.jpg|thumb|A Shinto priest performs a purification ceremony prior to the start of filming.]]\nThe original screenplay that Yukiko Takayama created after winning Toho's story contest for the next establishment in the Godzilla series, which was picked by assistant producer Kenji Tokoro and was submitted for approval on July 1, 1974, less than four months after ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'' (1974) was released.\n\nThe original concept is similar to the finished version of ''Terror of Mechagodzilla'', with many of the changes being budgetary in nature. The most obvious alteration is the removal of the two monsters called the Titans, which merged to become Titanosaurus in the first draft. It was an interesting concept, although something that was also underexplained considering the magnitude of such an occurrence of the creatures merging. Another noticeable change to the script is that of the final battle, which doesn't move to the countryside but instead would have reduced Tokyo to rubble during the ensuing conflict between the three monsters.\n\nAfter her initial draft, Takayama submitted a revised version on October 14, 1974. This went through a third revision on December 4, and then yet another on December 28 of that same year before it was met with approval and filming began.\n\n===Filming===\nThis film, much unlike the films prior to it, had a much darker tone and returned to the original style of the series. It was much more serious, and fans often consider Titanosaurus to hark back to the more realistic kaiju of the early Showa era.\n\nThe film is one of the only ''Godzilla'' films with nudity. The scene occurs when Katsura is being operated on, at which point Katsura's breasts are exposed (although the body is actually a mannequin). This scene was cut from the US, both for the theatrical and TV versions of the film.\n\nDirector Ishiro Honda laments not being able to work with the story's writer, Yukiko Takayama, on other films, enjoying that a \"woman's perspective was especially fresh\" for the genre.\n\nKensho Yamashita was the chief assistant director on the project. He notes, though, that Ishiro Honda never actually assigned any of the shooting to him, possibly because Honda was happy to be directing again after a long gap in his career and wanted to do the work himself.\n\n==English version==\n[[Image:TerrorofGodzilla.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Bob Conn Enterprises' theatrical poster for the 1978 U.S release of ''The Terror of Godzilla''.

Just as Cinema Shares had done with the previous three ''Godzilla'' movies, Bob Conn Enterprises chose to utilize the Toho-commissioned English dub instead of hiring a new crew to re-dub the film. ''The Terror of Godzilla'' was heavily edited to obtain a \"G\" rating from the [[MPAA]]. Several scenes with violent content were entirely removed, disrupting the flow of the narrative.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|pp=205-206}}\n\n[[Henry G. Saperstein]], who sold the theatrical rights to Bob Conn Enterprises, also released the film to television in late 1978, this time under Toho\u2019s international title, ''Terror of Mechagodzilla''. Unlike ''The Terror of Godzilla'', the television version remained mostly uncut, with only a shot of Katsura\u2019s naked breasts excised. Saperstein\u2019s editors also added a prologue that serves as a brief history of Godzilla, with footage from Saperstein\u2019s English versions of ''[[Invasion of Astro-Monster]]'' and ''[[All Monsters Attack]]'' ( the latter of which utilized stock footage from ''[[Ebirah, Horror of the Deep]]'' and ''[[Son of Godzilla]]'').{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|pp=204}}\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the U.S. television version, ''Terror of Mechagodzilla'', was replaced by the theatrical edit, ''The Terror of Godzilla'', on television and home video. For some reason, the title was also changed to ''Terror of Mechagodzilla''.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|pp=205}} The 1994 Paramount release of ''Terror of Mechagodzilla'' listed a running time of 89 minutes on the slipcase, implying that this release would be the longer version first shown on American TV.

This was part of a decline in attendance for monster-movies as a whole and Toho put the production of monster-movies on hold.{{sfn|Berra|2010|p=109}} Toho had no intention of permanently ending the ''Godzilla'' series.

In February 1944, while threatened by American soldiers, the Japanese soldiers were saved by a mysterious dinosaur. He theorizes that the dinosaur was subsequently mutated into [[Godzilla]] in 1954 after a [[Castle Bravo|hydrogen bomb test]] on the island. Yasuaki Shindo ([[Yoshio Tsuchiya]]), a wealthy businessman who commanded the Japanese soldiers on Lagos Island, confirms that the dinosaur did indeed exist.\n\nMeanwhile, a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] lands on [[Mount Fuji]]. When the Japanese army investigates, they are greeted by Wilson (Chuck Wilson), Grenchiko (Richard Berger), Emmy Kano ([[Anna Nakagawa]]) and an android, M-11 ([[Robert Scott Field]]). The visitors, known as the \"Futurians\", explain that they are humans from the year [[23rd century|2204]], where Godzilla has completely destroyed Japan. The Futurians plan to [[time travel|travel back in time]] to 1944 and remove the dinosaur from Lagos Island before the island is irradiated in 1954, thus preventing the mutation of the creature into Godzilla. As proof of their story, Emmy presents a copy of Terasawa's book, which has not yet been completed in the present.\n\nThe Futurians, Terasawa, [[Miki Saegusa]] ([[Megumi Odaka]]), and Professor Mazaki ([[Katsuhiko Sasaki]]), board a time shuttle and travel back to 1944 to Lagos Island. There, as American forces land and engage the Japanese forces commanded by Shindo, the dinosaur attacks and kills the American soldiers. The American navy then bombs the dinosaur from the sea and gravely wounds it.\n\nAfter Shindo and his men leave the island, M-11 teleports the dinosaur from Lagos Island to a place in the [[Bering Strait]]. Before returning to 1992, the Futurians secretly leave three small creatures called Dorats on Lagos Island, which are exposed to radiation from the hydrogen bomb test in 1954 and merge to become [[King Ghidorah]], which then appears in present-day Japan. After returning to 1992, the Futurians use King Ghidorah to subjugate Japan. They issue an ultimatum, but Japan refuses to surrender.\n\nFeeling sympathy for the Japanese people, Emmy reveals to Terasawa the truth behind the Futurians' mission: in the future, Japan is an economic superpower that has surpassed the United States, Russia, and China. The Futurians traveled back in time in order to change history and prevent Japan's future economic dominance by creating King Ghidorah and using it to destroy present day Japan. At the same time, they also planned to erase Godzilla from history so it wouldn't pose a threat to their plans. After M-11 brings Emmy back to the UFO, she reprograms the android so it will help her. With M-11 and Terasawa's aid, Emmy sabotages the UFO's control over King Ghidorah.\n\nAt the same time, Shindo plans to use his nuclear submarine to recreate Godzilla. En route to the Bering Strait, Shindo's submarine is destroyed by an already mutated Godzilla, who absorbs its radiation and becomes even larger and more powerful. Terasawa discovers that a Russian nuclear submarine sank in the Bering Strait in the 1970s and released enough radiation to mutate the dinosaur into [[The Return of Godzilla|Godzilla]].\n\nGodzilla arrives in Japan and is met by King Ghidorah. They fight at equal strength, each immune to the other's attacks. Godzilla eventually ends the battle by blasting off Ghidorah's middle head. Before the final blow, Godzilla destroys the UFO, killing Wilson and Grenchiko. Godzilla then turns its attention on Tokyo, destroying the city and killing Shindo.\n\nEmmy travels to the future with M-11 and returns to the present day with Mecha-King Ghidorah, a cybernetic version of King Ghidorah. The cybernetic Ghidorah blasts Godzilla with energy beams, which proves useless. Godzilla then counters by relentlessly blasting Ghidorah with its atomic ray, almost decapitating Ghidorah. Ghidorah survives but Godzilla prevails, knocking Ghidorah down. Emmy carries off Godzilla and drops it and Ghidorah into the ocean. Emmy then returns to the future but not before informing Terasawa that she is his descendant.\n\nAt the bottom of the ocean, Godzilla awakens and roars over [[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II|Ghidorah's remains]] before swimming away.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[K\u014dsuke Toyohara]] as {{nihongo|Kenichiro Terasawa|\u5bfa\u6ca2 \u5065\u4e00\u90ce| Terasawa Kenichiro}}\n* [[Anna Nakagawa]] as {{nihongo|Emmy Kano|\u30a8\u30df\u30fc \u30ab\u30ce\u30fc| Emi Kano}}\n* [[Megumi Odaka]] as {{nihongo|[[Miki Saegusa]]|\u4e09\u679d \u672a\u5e0c| Saegusa Miki}}\n* [[Katsuhiko Sasaki]] as Professor {{nihongo|Mazaki|\u771f\u5d0e \u535a\u58eb| Mazaki-hakase}}\n* [[Akiji Kobayashi]] as {{nihongo|Ryuzo Dobashi|\u571f\u6a4b \u7adc\u4e09| Dobashi Ryuzo}}\n* Tokuma Nishioka as {{nihongo|Takehiko Fujio|\u85e4\u5c3e \u731b\u5f66| Fujio Takehiko}}\n* [[Yoshio Tsuchiya]] as {{nihongo|Yasuaki Shindo|\u65b0\u5802 \u9756\u660e| Shindo Yasuaki}}\n* Kiwako Harada as {{nihongo|Chiaki Morimura|\u68ee\u6751 \u5343\u6676| Morimura Chiaki}}\n* [[Kenji Sahara]] as Takayuki Segawa\n* [[So Yamamura]] as the Prime Minister\n* Chuck Wilson as Wilson\n* Richard Berger as Grenchiko\n* [[Robert Scott Field]] as M-11, an android\n* Koichi Ueda as Masukichi Ikehata, Lagos Island Veteran\n* [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]] as [[Godzilla]]\n* [[Hurricane Ryu]] as [[King Ghidorah]]\n* [[Wataru Fukuda]] as Godzillasaurus, Godzilla's un-mutated form\n\n==Production==\n[[File:GvKG - behind scenes.jpg|thumb|Preparations for the first fight scene]]\n\n===Conception===\nAlthough the previously filmed ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'' had been the most expensive ''Godzilla'' film produced at the time, its low audience attendance and loss of revenue convinced executive producer and ''Godzilla'' series creator [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]] to revitalize the series by bringing back iconic monsters from pre-1984 ''Godzilla'' movies, specifically Godzilla's archenemy [[King Ghidorah]].<ref name=\"Ryfle\"/>\n\n''Godzilla vs. Biollante'' director and writer [[Kazuki \u014cmori]] had initially hoped to start a standalone series centered on [[Mothra]], and was in the process of rewriting a 1980 script for the unrealized film ''Mothra vs. Bagan''. The film was ultimately scrapped by Toho, under the assumption that, unlike Godzilla, Mothra would have been a difficult character to market overseas. The planning stages for a sequel to ''Godzilla vs. Biollante'' were initially hampered by Tanaka's deteriorating health, thus prompting the takeover of [[Sh\u014dgo Tomiyama]] as producer. The new producer felt that the financial failure of ''Godzilla vs. Biollante'' was due to the plot being too sophisticated for child audiences, and thus intended to return some of the fantasy elements of the pre-1984 ''Godzilla'' films to the series. \u014cmori himself blamed the lackluster performance of ''Godzilla vs. Biollante'' on competition with ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', and thus concluded that audiences wanted plots involving time travel.<ref name=\"Kalat\"/> His approach to the film also differed from ''Godzilla vs. Biollante'' in his greater emphasis on developing the personalities of the monsters rather than the human characters.<ref name=\"Wong\">{{cite book|last1=Wong|first1=Kin Yuen|title=World Weavers: Globalization, Science Fiction, and the Cybernetic Revolution|date=2005|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=9789622097216|page=182|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tWnqAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA182&dq=godzilla+ghidorah&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5q6nDorXJAhUBHZQKHT25DTkQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=godzilla%20ghidorah&f=false|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Akira Ifukube]] agreed to compose the film's score on the insistence of his daughter, after as he was dissatisfied with the way his compositions had been treated in ''Godzilla vs. Biollante''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Special effects===\nThe Godzilla suits used in ''Godzilla vs. Biollante'' were reused in ''Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah'', though with slight modifications. The original suit used for land-based and full body shots had its head replaced with a wider and flatter one, and the body cut in half. The upper half was used in scenes where Godzilla emerges from the sea and during close-ups during the character's first fight with King Ghidorah. The suit used previously for scenes set at sea was modified with rounder shoulders, a more prominent chest, and an enhanced face, and was used throughout the majority of the film's Godzilla scenes.<ref>Robert Biondi, \"The Evolution of Godzilla \u2013 G-Suit Variations Throughout the Monster King\u2019s Twenty One Films\", ''G-FAN'' #16 (July/August 1995)</ref>\n\nThe redesigned King Ghidorah featured much more advanced wirework puppetry than its predecessors, and effects team leader [[Koichi Kawakita]] designed the \"Godzillasaurus\" as a more paleontologically accurate-looking dinosaur than Godzilla itself as a nod to American filmmakers aspiring to direct their own ''Godzilla'' films with the intention of making the monster more realistic.<ref name=\"Kalat\"/> \u014cmori's original draft specified that the dinosaur that would become Godzilla was a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', though this was rejected by creature designer Shinji Nishikawa, who stated that he \"couldn't accept that a tyrannosaur could become Godzilla\". The final suit combined features of ''Tyrannosaurus'' with Godzilla, and real [[octopus]] blood was used during the bombardment scene. Because the Godzillasaurus' arms were much smaller than Godzilla's, suit performer [[Wataru Fukuda]] had to operate them with levers within the costume. The creature's distress calls were recycled [[Gamera]] cries.<ref name=\"Wong\"/>\n\n==Home media==\nThe Columbia/TriStar Home Video DVD version was released in 1998 as a single disc double feature with ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]''.

Later, a representative of the Japanese Prime Minister offers to have Takuya's charges dropped if he explores Infant Island with his ex-wife, Masako Tezuka and Kenji Ando, the secretary of the rapacious Marutomo company. After the trio arrives on the island, they find a cave containing a depiction of two giant insects in battle. Further exploration leads them to a giant egg and a pair of diminutive humanoids called Cosmos, who identify the egg as belonging to [[Mothra]].\n\nThe Cosmos tell of an ancient civilization that tried to control the Earth's climate, thus provoking the Earth into creating Battra, which became uncontrollable, and started to harm the very planet that created it. Mothra, another earth protector, fought an apocalyptic battle with Battra, who eventually lost. The Cosmos explain how the meteoroid uncovered Mothra's egg, and may have awoken Battra, who is still embittered over humanity's interference in the Earth's natural order.\n\nThe Marutomo company sends a freighter to Infant Island to pick up the egg, ostensibly to protect it. As they are sailing, Godzilla surfaces and heads toward the newly hatched Mothra larva. Battra, also as a larva, soon appears and joins the fight, allowing Mothra to retreat. The battle between Godzilla and Battra is eventually taken underwater, where the force of the battle causes a giant crack in the ocean's floor that swallows the two.\n\nMasako and Takuya later discover Ando's true intentions when he kidnaps the Cosmos and takes them to Marutomo headquarters, where the [[CEO]] intends to use them for publicity purposes. Mothra enters Tokyo in an attempt to rescue the Cosmos, but is attacked by the JSDF. The wounded Mothra heads for the Diet building and starts building a cocoon around herself. Meanwhile, Godzilla surfaces from [[Mount Fuji]].\n\nBoth Mothra and Battra attain their imago forms and converge at Yokohama Cosmo World. Godzilla interrupts the battle and attacks Battra. The two moths decide to join forces against Godzilla. Eventually, Mothra and Battra overwhelm Godzilla and carry it over the ocean. Godzilla bites Battra's neck and fires its atomic breath into the wound, killing Battra. A tired Mothra drops Godzilla and the lifeless Battra into the water below, sealing Godzilla below the surface by creating a mystical glyph with scales from her wings. The next morning, the Cosmos explain that Battra had been waiting many years to destroy an even larger meteoroid that would threaten the Earth in 1999. Mothra had promised she would stop the future collision if Battra were to die, and she and the Cosmos leave Earth as the humans bid farewell.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tetsuya Bessho]] as {{nihongo|Takuya Fujito|\u85e4\u6238 \u62d3\u4e5f|Fujito Takuya}}\n* [[Satomi Kobayashi]] as {{nihongo|Masako Tezuka|\u624b\u585a \u96c5\u5b50}}\n* Takehiro Murata as {{nihongo|Kenji Ando|\u5b89\u6771 \u5065\u4e8c|Ando Kenji}}\n* Keiko Imamura and Sayaka Osawa as the {{nihongo|Cosmos|\u30b3\u30b9\u30e2\u30b9|Kosumosu}}\n* Saburo Shinoda as {{nihongo|Professor Shigeki Fukazawa|\u6df1\u6ca2 \u91cd\u6a39|Fukazawa Shigeki}}\n* [[Akiji Kobayashi]] as {{nihongo|Ryuzo Dobashi|\u571f\u6a4b \u7adc\u4e09|Dobashi Ryuzo}}\n* [[Megumi Odaka]] as  {{nihongo|[[Miki Saegusa]]|\u4e09\u679d \u672a\u5e0c|Saegusa Miki}}\n* [[Akira Takarada]] as {{nihongo|Joji Minamino|\u5357\u91ce \u4e08\u4e8c|Minamino Joji}}\n* Makoto Otake as Takeshi Tomokane\n* Shiori Yonezawa as Midori Tezuka\n* [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]] as [[Godzilla]]\n* [[Hurricane Ryu]] as the Battra larva\n\n==Production==\nThe idea of shooting a movie featuring a revamped [[Mothra]] dated back to a screenplay written in 1990 by Akira Murao entitled ''Mothra vs. Bagan'', which revolved around a vengeful dragon called Bagan who sought to destroy humanity for its abuse of the Earth's resources, only to be defeated by Mothra, the goddess of peace. The screenplay was revised by [[Kazuki \u014cmori]] after the release of ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'', though the project was ultimately scrapped by Toho, under the assumption that Mothra was a character born purely out of Japanese culture, and thus would have been difficult to market overseas unlike the more internationally recognized [[Godzilla]].<ref name=\"kalat2010.2\">{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland & Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=179\u2013183|edition=2nd}}</ref> \n\nAfter the success of ''[[Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah]]'', producer [[Sh\u014dgo Tomiyama]] and ''Godzilla'' series creator [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]] proposed resurrecting [[King Ghidorah]] in a film entitled ''Ghidorah's Counterattack'', but relented when polls demonstrated that Mothra was more popular with women, who comprised the majority of Japan's population. Tomiyama replaced \u014cmori with [[Takao Okawara]] as director, but maintained \u014cmori as screenwriter. Hoping to maintain as much of ''Mothra vs. Bagan'' as possible, \u014cmori reconceptualized Bagan as Badora, a dark twin to Mothra. The character was later renamed Battra (a [[portmanteau]] of \"battle\" and \"Mothra\"), as the first name was disharmonious in Japanese. Tomiyama had intended to feature ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]'' star [[Frankie Sakai]], but was unable to because of scheduling conflicts. The final battle between Godzilla, Mothra and Battra was originally meant to have a more elaborate conclusion; as in the final product, Godzilla would have been transported to sea, only to kill Battra and plunge into the ocean. However, the site of their fall would have been the submerged, [[Stonehenge]]-like ruins of the Cosmos civilization, which would have engulfed and trapped Godzilla with a forcefield activated by Mothra.<ref name=\"kalat2010.1\"/>\n\n[[Ishir\u014d Honda]], who directed the first ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' film and many others, visited the set shortly before dying.<ref name=\"kalat2010.1\"/>\n\n===Special effects===\nKoichi Kawakita continued his theme of giving Godzilla's opponents the ability to metamorphose, and had initially intended to have Mothra killed off, only to be reborn as the cybernetic moth ''MechaMothra'', though this was scrapped early in production, thus making ''Godzilla vs. Mothra'' the first post-1984 ''Godzilla'' movie to not feature a [[mecha]] contraption. The underwater scenes were filmed through an aquarium filled with fish set between the performers and the camera. Kawakita's team constructed a new Godzilla suit from previously used molds,<ref name=\"kalat2010.1\"/> though it was made slimmer than previous suits, the neck given more prominent ribbing, and the arrangement of the character's dorsal plates was changed so that the largest plate was placed on the middle of the back. The arms were more flexible at the biceps, and the face was given numerous cosmetic changes; the forehead was reduced and flattened, the teeth scaled down, and the eyes given a golden tint. The head was also electronically modified to allow more vertical mobility.<ref name=\"biondi\">Robert Biondi, \"The Evolution of Godzilla \u2013 G-Suit Variations Throughout the Monster King\u2019s Twenty One Films\", ''G-FAN'' #16 (July/August 1995)</ref> Filming the Godzilla scenes was hampered when the suit previously used for ''Godzilla vs. Biollante'' and ''Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah'', which was needed for some stunt-work, was stolen from Toho studios, only to be recovered at [[Lake Okutama]] in bad condition.<ref name=\"kalat2010.1\"/> The remains of the suit were recycled for the first battle sequence.<ref name=\"biondi\"/> Godzilla's roar was reverted to the high-pitched shriek from pre-1984 ''Godzilla'' films, while Battra's sound effects were recycled from those of [[Rodan]].<ref name=\"kalat2010.1\"/> In designing Battra, which the script described as a \"black Mothra\", artist Shinji Nishikawa sought to distance its design from Mothra's by making its adult form more similar to its larval one than is the case with Mothra, and combining Mothra's two eyes into one.<ref name=\"nishikawa\">David Milner, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/nishikaw.htm \"Shinji Nishikawa Interview\"], ''Kaiju Conversations'' (December 1995) davmil.org</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Godzilla vs. Mothra'' was released in Japan on December 12, 1992 where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=381}} The film sold approximately 4,200,000 tickets in Japan, becoming the number one Japanese film on the domestic market in the period that included the year 1993.
