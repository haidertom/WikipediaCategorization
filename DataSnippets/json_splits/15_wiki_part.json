A branch of the [[Glamorganshire Canal]] (1811) was used to transport these products; then the railway became the main means of transport to the South Wales coast.<ref name=EB/> From the 1870s onwards, the economy of the town was dominated by the coal mining industry, with only a small [[tinplate]] works. There were also several brickworks and breweries.  During the latter half of the 19th century, considerable improvements were made to the town, which became a pleasant place to live, despite the nearby collieries. A postgraduate theological college opened in connection with the Church of England in 1892, but in 1907 it moved to [[Llandaff]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n[[File:Aberdare 1910s.jpg|thumb|left|Aberdare in the 1910s]]\nWith the ecclesiastical parishes of St Fagan's (Trecynon) and Aberaman carved out of the ancient parish, Aberdare had 12 [[Anglican]] churches and one [[Catholic]] church, built in 1866 in Monk Street near the site of a cell attached to [[Penrhys#Medieval monastery|Penrhys monastery]]; and at one time there were over 50 [[Nonconformist]] chapels (including those in surrounding settlements such as [[Cwmaman]] and [[Llwydcoed]]). The services in the majority of the chapels were in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. Most of these chapels have now closed, with many converted to other uses.

There are several [[cairn]]s and the remains of a circular [[Brython|British]] encampment on the mountain between Aberdare and [[Merthyr]]. [[Hirwaun]] moor, 4 miles to the north west of Aberdare, was according to tradition the scene of a battle at which [[Rhys ap Tewdwr]], prince of [[Dyfed]], was defeated by the allied forces of the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Robert Fitzhamon]] and [[Iestyn ap Gwrgant]], the last Welsh prince of [[Glamorgan]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Population growth==\nThe parish population was 1,486 in 1801, but expanded fast, especially during the 1840s and 1850s: the population of the Aberdare District, centred on the town, was 9,322 in 1841; 18,774 in 1851; and 37,487 in 1861. This population growth, a result of the growth of the [[steam coal]] trade (see below) was increasingly concentrated in the previously agricultural areas of Blaengwawr and Cefnpennar to the south of the town. Many of the migrants came from the rural parts of west Wales which had been affected by an agricultural depression.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=149\u201352}} Population levels continued to increase over the next forty years, albeit with a small decline in the 1870s. The first decade of the 20th century saw a further sharp increase, largely as a result of the steam coal trade, reaching 53,779 in 1911.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Statistical Evidence|page=44}}</ref> The population has since declined owing to the loss of most of the heavy industry.\n\nThe Aberdare population at the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] was 31,705 (ranked 13th largest in Wales).<ref>{{cite web |work=Office for National Statistics. | publisher=clickonwales.org| title=Settlements |url=http://www.clickonwales.org/wp-content/uploads/4_Factfile_Settlements.pdf| page=1| accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref> By 2011 it was 29,748, though the figure includes the surrounding populations of [[Aberaman]], [[Abercwmboi]], [[Cwmbach]] and [[Llwydcoed]].<ref name=2011census>{{NOMIS2011|id=1119885767|title=Aberdare Built-up area |accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==21st century==\nOn 1 December 2016, following ''The Rhondda Cynon Taf (Communities) Order 2016'', the [[Community (Wales)|community]] of Aberdare was split into two new communities, [[Aberdare East]] and [[Aberdare West]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2016/1156/pdfs/wsi_20161156_mi.pdf |title=The Rhondda Cynon Taf (Communities) Order 2016 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=1 April 2018 }}</ref> These are coterminous with the [[electoral ward]]s of the same names.

A large proportion of the early migrant population were Welsh speaking, and in 1851 only ten per cent of the population had been born outside of Wales.{{sfn|Turner|1984|p=6}}\n\nIn his controversial evidence to the [[Treason of the Blue Books|1847 Education Reports]] (known in Wales as the ''Brad y Llyfrau Gleision'' or ''Treachery of the Blue Books''), the Anglican vicar of Aberdare, [[John Griffith (Anglican priest)|John Griffith]], stated that the English language was \"generally understood\" and referred to the arrival of people from anglicised areas such as Radnorshire and south Pembrokeshire.<ref>{{cite web|title=1847 Report into the State of Education in Wales|url=http://digidol.llgc.org.uk/METS/SEW00002g/frames?div=1&subdiv=0&locale=en&mode=reference}}, p.489</ref> Griffith also made allegations about the Welsh speaking population and what he considered to be the degraded character of the women of Aberdare, alleging sexual promiscuity was an accepted social convention, that drunkenness and improvidence amongst the miners was common and attacking what he saw as exaggerated emotion in the religious practices of the Nonconformists.<ref name=\"Jones 272\">{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Communities|page=272}}</ref>\n[[File:Rev Thomas Price.jpg|thumbnail|right|Rev Thomas Price (1820\u201388), minister of Capel Calfaria]]\n\nThis evidence helped inform the findings of the report which would go on to stigmatise Welsh people as \"ignorant\", \"lazy\" and \"immoral\" and found the reason for this was the continued use of the Welsh language, which it described as \"evil\". The controversial reports allowed the local non-conformist minister [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]] of [[Calfaria, Aberdare|Capel Calfaria]] to arrange public debates, from which he would emerge as a leading defender of the Welsh language and by extension, the local population,<ref name=CMG48>{{cite news|title=Public Meeting at Aberdare|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3089162/ART21|accessdate=20 November 2013|newspaper=Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian|date=26 February 1848}}</ref> Rev.

This pattern continued after the [[Second World War]] despite the advent of Welsh medium education.

The iron industry began to expand in a significant way around 1818 when the Crawshay family of Merthyr purchased the [[Hirwaun]] ironworks and place them under independent management. In the following year, [[Rowland Fothergill]] took over the ironworks at [[Abernant, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Abernant]] and a few years later did the same at [[Llwydcoed]]. Both concerns later fell into the hands of his nephew [[Richard Fothergill (politician)|Richard Fothergill]]. The Gadlys Ironworks was established in 1827 by Matthew Wayne, who had previously managed the [[Cyfarthfa]] ironworks at Merthyr.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=150}} The Gadlys works, now considered an important archaeological site, originally comprised four blast furnaces, inner forges, rowing mills and puddling furnaces. The development of these works provided impetus to the growth of Aberdare as a nucleated town.<ref name=\"Conservation Rep\" /> The iron industry was gradually superseded by coal and all the five iron works had closed by 1875, as the local supply of iron ore was inadequate to meet the ever-increasing demand created by the invention of steel, and as a result the importing of ore proved more profitable.<ref name=\"Conservation Rep\" />\n\n===Coal industry===\nThe iron industry had a relatively small impact upon the economy of Aberdare and in 1831 only 1.2% of the population was employed in manufacturing, as opposed to 19.8% in neighbouring Merthyr Tydfil.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=150}} In the early years of Aberdare's development, most of the coal worked in the parish was coking coal, and was consumed locally, chiefly in the [[ironworks]].<ref name=EB1911/> Although the [[Gadlys]] works was small in comparison with the other ironworks it became significant as the Waynes also became involved in the production of sale coal.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=149\u201350}} In 1836, this activity led to the exploitation of the \"Four-foot Seam\" of high-[[heating value|calorific value]] [[steam coal]] began, and pits were sunk in rapid succession.\n\nIn 1840, Thomas Powell sank a pit at [[Cwmbach]], and during the next few years he opened another four pits. In the next few years, other local entrepreneurs now became involved in the expansion of the coal trade, including [[David Williams (coal owner)|David Williams]] at Ynysgynon and [[David Davis, Blaengwawr (coal owner)|David Davis]] at Blaengwawr, as well as the latter's son [[David Davis, Maesyffynnon (coal owner)|David Davis, Maesyffynnon]]. They were joined by newcomers such as [[Crawshay Bailey]] at Aberaman and, in due course, [[Sir George Elliot, 1st Baronet|George Elliot]] in the lower part of the valley.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=150\u20131}} This coal was valuable for steam railways and [[steam ship]]s, and an export trade began,<ref name=EB/> via the [[Taff Vale Railway]] and the port of [[Cardiff]]. The population of the parish rose from 6,471 in 1841 to 14,999 in 1851 and 32,299 in 1861 and John Davies<ref>Davies, John, ''A History of Wales'', Penguin, 1994, {{ISBN|0-14-014581-8}}, p 400</ref> described it as \"the most dynamic place in Wales\". In 1851, the [[Admiralty]] decided to use Welsh steam coal in ships of the [[Royal Navy]], and this decision boosted the reputation of Aberdare's product and launched a huge international export market.<ref name=\"Davies, ''op cit'', p 400\">Davies, ''op cit'', p 400</ref> Coal mined in Aberdare parish rose from {{convert|177000|LT|t}} in 1844 to {{convert|477000|LT|t}} in 1850,<ref>Davies, ''op cit'', p 384</ref> and the coal trade, which after 1875 was the chief support of the town, soon reached huge dimensions.\n\nThe growth of the coal trade inevitably led to a number of industrial disputes, some of which were local and others which affected the wider coalfield. Trade unionism began to appear in the Aberdare Valley at intervals from the 1830s onwards but the first significant manifestation occurred during the [[Aberdare Strike 1857-8|Aberdare Strike of 1857\u20138]]. The dispute was initiated by the depression in trade which followed the [[Crimean War]] and saw the local coal owners successfully impose a reduction in wages. The dispute did, however, witness an early manifestation of mass trade unionism amongst the miners of the valley and although unsuccessful the dispute saw the emergence of a stronger sense of solidarity amongst the miners.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=166\u20138}}\n\nSteam coal was subsequently found in the [[Ystradyfodwg|Rhondda]] and further west, but many of the great companies of the Welsh coal industry's Gilded Age started operation in Aberdare and the lower Cynon Valley, including those of [[David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda|Samuel Thomas]], [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies and Sons]], [[John Nixon (mining engineer)|Nixon's Navigation]] and [[Powell Duffryn]].<ref name=\"Davies, ''op cit'', p 400\"/>\n\nIn common with the rest of the South Wales coalfield, Aberdare's coal industry commenced a long decline after [[World War I]], and the last two deep mines still in operation in the 1960s were the small Aberaman and Fforchaman collieries, which closed in 1962 and 1965 respectively.\n\n[[File:Aberdare Co-operative store fire, May 11th 1919.jpg|thumb|right|Aberdare Co-operative store fire, 11 May 1919]]\nOn 11 May 1919, an extensive fire broke out on Cardiff Street, Aberdare.\n\nWith the decline of both iron and coal, Aberdare has become reliant on commercial businesses as a major source of employment. Its industries include cable manufacture, smokeless fuels, and tourism.<ref name=EB/>\n\n==Government==\nAs a small village in the upland valleys of Glamorgan, Aberdare did not play any significant part in political life until its development as an industrial settlement. It was part of the lordship of Miskin, and the ancient office of High Constable continued in ceremonial form until relatively recent times.\n\n===Parliamentary elections===\nIn 1832, Aberdare was removed from the county of Glamorgan and became part of the parliamentary borough of [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]]. For much of the nineteenth century, the representation was initially controlled by the ironmasters of Merthyr, notably the Guest family. From 1852 until 1868 the seat was held by [[Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare|Henry Austen Bruce]] whose main industrial interests lay in the Aberdare valley. Bruce was a Liberal but was viewed with suspicion by the more [[Radicals (UK)|radical]] faction which became increasingly influential within Welsh Liberalism in the 1860s. The radicals supported such policies as the disestablishment of the Church of England and were closely allied to the [[Liberation Society]].\n\n====1868 general election====\nNonconformist ministers played a prominent role in this new politics and, at Aberdare, they found an effective spokesman in the Rev [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]] minister of [[Calfaria, Aberdare]]. Following the granting of a second parliamentary seat to the borough of Merthyr Tydfil in 1867, the Liberals of Aberdare sought to ensure that a candidate from their part of the constituency was returned alongside the sitting member, [[Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare|Henry Austen Bruce]]. Their choice fell upon [[Richard Fothergill (politician)|Richard Fothergill]], owner of the ironworks at Abernant, who was enthusiastically supported by the Rev Thomas Price. Shortly before the election, however, [[Henry Richard]] intervened as a radical Liberal candidate, invited by the radicals of Merthyr. To many people's surprise, Price was lukewarm about his candidature and continued to support Fothergill. Ultimately, [[Henry Richard]] won a celebrated victory with Fothergill in second place and Bruce losing his seat. Richard thus became one of the-first radical MPs from Wales.{{sfn|Morgan|1991|pp=23\u20135}}\n\n====1874\u20131914====\nAt the 1874 General Election, both Richard and Fothergill were again returned, although the former was criticised for his apparent lack of sympathy towards the miners during the industrial disputes of the early 1870s. This led to the emergence of Thomas Halliday as the first [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|labour]] or working-class candidate to contest a Welsh constituency. Although he polled well, Halliday fell short of being elected. For the remainder of the nineteenth century, the constituency was represented by industrialists, most notably [[David Alfred Thomas]]. In 1900, however, Thomas was joined by [[Keir Hardie]], the [[Independent Labour Party|ILP]] candidate, who became the first labour representative to be returned for a Welsh constituency independent of the Liberal Party.\n\n====Twentieth century====\nThe [[Aberdare (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdare]] constituency came into being at the 1918 election. The first representative was [[Charles Butt Stanton]] who had been elected at a by-election following Hardie's death in 1915. However, in 1922, Stanton was defeated by a Labour candidate and the party has held the seat ever since. The only significant challenge came from [[Plaid Cymru]] at the 1970 and February 1974 General Elections but this performance has not since been repeated. Since 1984 the parliamentary seat, now known as [[Cynon Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Cynon Valley]] has been held by [[Ann Clwyd]].\n\n===Local government===\nUntil the mid-nineteenth century the local government of Aberdare and its locality remained in the hands of traditional structures such as the parish vestry and the High Constable, who was chosen on an annual basis. However, the rapid industrial development of the parsing resulted in the situation where these traditional bodies could not cope with the realities of an urbanised, industrial community which had developed without any planning or facilities. During the early decades of the century the iron masters gradually imposed their influence over local affairs and this remained the case following the formation of the Merthyr Board of Guardians in 1836. During the 1850s and early 1860s, however, as coal displaced iron as the main industry in the valley, the ironmasters were displaced as the dominant group in local government and administration by an alliance between mostly indigenous coal owners, shopkeepers and tradesmen, professional men and dissenting ministers. A central figure in this development was the Rev [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]]. The growth of this alliance was rooted in the reaction to the [[Treason of the Blue Books|1847 Education Reports]] and the subsequent efforts to establish a British School at Aberdare.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=156\u201360}}\n\nIn the 1840s there were no adequate sanitary facilities or water supply and life expectancy was low. Outbreaks of cholera and typhus were commonplace.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=152}} Against this background, [[Thomas Webster Rammell]] prepared a report for the General Board of Health on the sanitary condition of the parish, which concluded that a [[Aberdare Lpcal Board of Health|Local Board of Health]] be established.{{sfn|Rammell|1853|pp=28\u20139}}  This happened in 1854. Its first chairman was [[Richard Fothergill (politician)|Richard Fothergill]] and the members included [[David Davis, Blaengwawr (coal owner)|David Davis, Blaengwawr]], [[David Williams (coal owner)|David Williams (''Alaw Goch'')]], [[Rees Hopkin Rhys (industrialist and local politician)|Rees Hopkin Rhys]] and the [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Rev.

The lack of a Free Library, however, remained a concern.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parry|title=Labour Leaders and Local Politics|pages=400, 402}}</ref>\n\nLater, the formation of the [[Glamorgan County Council]] (upon which Aberdare had five elected members) in 1889, followed by the [[Aberdare Urban District Council]], which replaced the Local Board in 1889, transformed the local politics of the Aberdare valley.\n[[File:Aberdare January 2013 snow.jpg|thumb|Aberdare in January 2013]]\nAt the [[1889 Glamorgan County Council Elections]] most of the elected representatives were coalowners and industrialists and the only exception in the earlier period was the miners' agent [[David Morgan (trade unionist)|David Morgan]] (Dai o'r Nant), elected in 1892 as a labour representative. From the early 1900s, however, Labour candidates began to gain ground and dominated local government from the 1920s onwards. The same pattern was seen on the Aberdare UDC.\n\nIn 1974, following local government re-organization, Aberdare became part of the county of [[Mid Glamorgan]] and the [[Cynon Valley Borough Council]]. Labour members held a majority of seats on both authorities until their abolition in 1996. Since the latest re-organization, Aberdare has been part of the [[Rhondda Cynon Taff]] unitary authority. Once again, Labour has been the majority party although [[Plaid Cymru]] controlled the authority from 1999 until 2003.\n\nSince 1995 Aberdare has elected county councillors to [[Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council]]. The town lies mainly in the [[Aberdare East]] ward, represented by two county councillors. Nearby [[Cwmdare]], [[Llwydcoed]] and [[Trecynon]] are represented by the Aberdare West/Llwydcoed ward. Both wards have been represented by the [[Welsh Labour Party|Labour Party]] since 2012.<ref>[http://www.electionscentre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rhondda-Cyon-Taff-1995-2012.pdf Rhondda Cyon Taff County Borough Council Election Results 1995-2012], The Election Centre.

A number of local eisteddfodau had long been held in the locality, associated with figures such as [[William Williams (Carw Coch)]] The Eisteddfod was again held in Aberdare in 1885, and also in 1956 at [[Aberdare Park]] where the [[Gorsedd stones|Gorsedd standing stones]] still exist. At the last National Eisteddfod held in Aberdare in 1956 Mathonwy Hughes won the chair. From the mid nineteenth century, Aberdare was an important publishing centre where a large number of books and journals were produced, the majority of which were in the Welsh language. A newspaper entitled [[Y Gwladgarwr]] (the Patriot) was published at Aberdare from 1856 until 1882 and was circulated widely throughout the South Wales valleys.  From 1875 a more successful newspaper, [[Tarian y Gweithiwr]] (the Workman's Shield) was published at Aberdare by John Mills. Y Darian, as it was known, strongly supported the trade union movements among the miners and ironworkers of the valleys. The miners' leader, [[William Abraham (trade unionist)|William Abraham]], derived support from the newspaper, which was also aligned with radical nonconformist liberalism. The rise of the political labour movement and the subsequent decline of the Welsh language in the valleys, ultimately led to its decline and closure in 1934.\n\nThe [[Coliseum Theatre (Aberdare)|Coliseum Theatre]] is Aberdare's main arts venue, containing a 600-seat [[auditorium]] and cinema. It is situated in nearby [[Trecynon]] and was built in 1938 using [[miner]]s' subscriptions.\n\nThe [[Second World War]] poet [[Alun Lewis (poet)|Alun Lewis]], was born near Aberdare in the village [[Cwmaman]] and there is a plaque commemorating him, including a quotation from his poem ''The Mountain over Aberdare''.\n\nThe founding members of the rock band [[Stereophonics]] originated from the nearby village of [[Cwmaman]].  It is also the hometown of guitarist [[Mark Parry (musician)|Mark Parry]] of Vancouver rock band [[The Manvils]].  Famed [[anarcho-punk|anarchist-punk]] band [[Crass]] played their last live show for striking miners in Aberdare during the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|UK miners' strike]].\n\n[[Griffith Rhys Jones|Griffith Rhys Jones \u2212 or Caradog]] as he was commonly known \u2212 was the Conductor of the famous 'C\u00f4r Mawr' of some 460 voices (the South Wales Choral Union), which twice won first prize at Crystal Palace choral competitions in London in the 1870s.  He is depicted in the town's most prominent statue by sculptor [[Sir William Goscombe John|Goscombe John]], unveiled on Victoria Square in 1920.\n\nAberdare was culturally twinned with the German town of [[Ravensburg]].\n\n==Religion==\n\n===Anglican Church===\nThe original parish church of [[St John's Church, Aberdare|St John the Baptist]] was originally built in 1189. Some of its original architecture is still intact.<ref name=EB/><ref name=\"Newman133\"/>\n[[File:Aberdare St John the Baptist Church.jpg|thumb|left|St John the Baptist's Church]]\n\nWith the development of Aberdare as an industrial centre in the nineteenth century it became increasingly apparent that the ancient church was far too small to service the perceived spiritual needs of an urban community, particularly in view of the rapid growth of nonconformity from the 1830s onwards. Eventually, [[John Griffith (Anglican priest)|John Griffith]], the rector of Aberdare undertook to raise funds to build a new church, leading to the rapid construction of [[St Elvan's Church, Aberdare|St Elvan's Church]] in the town centre between 1851 and 1852.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Communities|pages=88\u2013104}}</ref> This [[Church in Wales]] church still stands the heart of the parish of Aberdare and has had extensive work since its erection.<ref name=\"Newman133\">Newman (1995), p.133</ref> The church has a modern electrical, two-manual and pedal board pipe organ,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=P00388|title=Glamorgan (Glamorgan, Mid), Aberdare, St. Elvan, Church Street, Victoria Square|work=The British Institute of Organ Studies2005 |publisher=National Pipe Organ Register |year=2005 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref> that is still used in services.\n[[File:Aberdare St Elvan's church.jpg|thumb|right| St Elvan's Church]]\n\nJohn Griffith, vicar of Aberdare, who built St Elvan's, transformed the role of the Anglican church in the valley by building a number of other churches, including [[St Fagan's Church|St Fagan's]], [[Trecynon]]. Other churches in the parish are St Luke's ([[Cwmdare]]), St James's ([[Llwydcoed]]) and St Matthew's Church (1891) ([[Abernant, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Abernant]]).<ref name=\"Newman134\">Newman (1995), p. 134</ref>\n\nIn the parish of Aberaman and Cwmaman is St Margaret's Church, with an old, but beautiful, pipe organ with two manuals and a pedal board. Also in this parish is St Joseph's Church, Cwmaman. St Joseph's has recently undergone much recreational work, almost converting the church into a community centre. However, regular church services still take place. Here, there is a two-manual and pedal board electric organ, with speakers at the front and sides of the church.\n\nIn 1910 there were 34 Anglican churches in the Urban District of Aberdare. A survey of the attendance at places of worship on a particular Sunday in that year recorded that 17.8% of worshippers attended church services, with the remainder attending nonconformist chapels.<ref name=statrel />\n\n===Nonconformity===\nThe Aberdare Valley was a stronghold of [[Nonconformity in Wales|Nonconformity]] from the mid-nineteenth century until the inter-war years. In the aftermath of the [[Treachery of the Blue Books|1847 Education Reports]] nonconformists became increasingly active in the political and educational life of Wales and in few places was this as prevalent as at Aberdare. The leading figure was [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]], minister of Calfaria, Aberdare.\n\nAberdare was a major centre of the [[1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival|1904\u201305 Religious Revival]], which had begun at [[Loughor]] near Swansea. The revival aroused alarm among ministers for the revolutionary, even anarchistic, impact it had upon chapel congregations and denominational organisation. In particular, it was seen as drawing attention away from pulpit preaching and the role of the minister.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morgan|title=Rebirth of a Nation|pages=134\u20135}}</ref> The local newspaper, the ''Aberdare Leader'', regarded the revival with suspicion from the outset, objecting to the 'abnormal heat' which it engendered.<ref name=\"AL 19-11-04 edit\">{{cite news|title=Editorial.|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3576279/3576283/29\n|accessdate=11 February 2016|newspaper=Aberdare Leader|date=19 November 1904|page=4}}</ref> [[Trecynon]] was particularly affected by the revival, and the meetings held there were sais to have aroused more emotion and excitement than the more restrained meetings in Aberdare itself. The impact of the revival was significant in the short term, but in the longer term was fairly transient.\n\nOnce the immediate impact of the revival had faded, it was clear from the early twentieth century that there was a gradual decline in the influence of the chapels. This can be explained by several factors, including the rise of socialism and the process of linguistic change which saw the younger generation increasingly turn to the English language. There were also theological controversies such as that over the New Theology propounded by [[R.J. Campbell]].<ref name=\"AL 7-11-08 NT\">{{cite news|title=Old v New Theology. Conflict at Abercwmboi.|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3578004/ART31|accessdate=14 March 2015|newspaper=Aberdare Leader|date=7 November 1908}}</ref>\n\nOf the many chapels, few are still used for their original purpose and a number of closed since the turn of the millennium. Many have been converted for housing or other purposes (including one at Robertstown which has become a mosque), and others demolished. Among the notable chapels were [[Calfaria, Aberdare]] and [[Seion, Cwmaman]] (Baptist); [[Saron, Aberaman]] and [[Siloa, Aberdare]] (Independent); and [[Bethania, Aberdare]] (Calvinistic Methodist).\n\n====Independents====\nThe earliest Welsh Independent, or Congregationalist chapel in the Aberdare area was Ebenezer, trecynon, although meetings had been held from the latter years of the eighteenth century in dwelling houses in the locality, for example at Hirwaun.<ref name=\"AL OA 25-10-13\">{{cite news|title=Old Aberdare.

The Independent ministers of nineteenth-century Aberdare included some powerful personalities but none had the kind of wider social authority which Thomas Price enjoyed amongst the Baptists.\n[[File:Siloa Chapel, Aberdare - geograph.org.uk - 679638.jpg|thumb|right|Siloa Chapel, Aberdare]]\n\nOf the other Independent chapels in the valley [[Saron, Aberaman|Saron]], in Davis Street, Aberaman, was used for regular services by a small group of members until 2011. For many years, these were held in a small side-room, and not the chapel itself. The chapel has a large vestry comprising rows of two-way-facing wooden benches and a stage, with a side entrance onto Beddoe Street and back entrance to Lewis Street. Although the building is not in good repair, the interior, including pulpit and balcony seating area (back & sides), was in good order but the chapel eventually closed due to the very small number of members remaining. In February 1999, Saron was made a Grade II Listed Building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-21368-saron-independent-chapel-aberaman| title=Saron Independent Chapel, Aberaman |publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk |accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Baptists====\nThe Baptists were the most influential of the nonconformist denominations in Aberdare and their development was led by the Rev. [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]] who came to Aberdare in the early 1840s as minister of [[Calfaria, Aberdare|Calfaria]] Chapel.<ref name=\"Jones, Explorations and Explanations\">Jones, Explorations and Explanations, p.197\u22128</ref> In 1837 the Baptists had three chapels, but in 1897 there were twenty, seventeen of them being Welsh.<ref name=\"Rees, Chapels in the Valley\"/> By 1910 the number of chapels had increased to 30, with a total membership of 7,422.<ref name=statrel>{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Statistical Evidence|page=447}}</ref> Most of these Baptist chapels were established under the influence of Thomas Price who encouraged members to establish branch chapels to attract migrants who flocked to the town and locality from rural Wales. The chapels came together for regular gatherings, including baptismal services which were held in the [[River Cynon]]<ref name=\"AL OA 5-4-1913\">{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=D.T.|title=Old Aberdare.

Derelict for many years, it was demolished in 2015. The Methodists were numerically powerful and while some of their ministers such as William James of [[Bethania, Aberdare|Bethania]] served on the [[Aberdare School Board]] and other public bodies, their constitution militated against the sort of active political action which came more naturally to the Baptists and Independents.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Communities|pages=270}}</ref>\n\n====Other denominations====\nThe other denominations were weaker, including the Wesleyan Methodists who had 14 places of worship by 1910.<ref name=statrel /> There was also a significant Unitarian tradition in the valley and three places of worship by 1910.<ref name=statrel /> Highland Place Unitarian Church celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukunitarians.org.uk/aberdare/history.htm |title=Aberdare Unitarian Church |publisher=Ukunitarians.org.uk |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> with a number of lectures on its history and the history of Unitarianism in Wales taking place there. The church has a two-manual pipe organ with pedal board that is used to accompany all services. The current organist is Grace Jones, the sister of the former organist Jacob Jones. The connected schoolroom is used for post-service meetings and socialising.\n\n===Judaism===\nSeymour Street was once home to a synagogue which opened its doors in the late 1800s and which closed in 1957. The site now has a [[blue plaque]].<ref>https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/once-thriving-aberdare-jewish-community-recognised-8549278</ref>\n\n==Education==\n\nThe state of education in the parish was a cause for concern during the early industrial period as is illustrated by the reaction to the [[Treachery of the Blue Books|1847 Education Reports]]. Initially, there was an outcry, led by the Rev [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]] against the comments made by the vicar of Aberdare in his submission to the commissioners. However, on closer reflection, the reports related the deficiencies of educational provision, not only in Aberdare itself but also in the communities of the valleys generally. In so doing they not only criticised the ironmasters for their failure to provide schools for workers' children but also the nonconformists for not establishing [[British and Foreign School Society|British Schools]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Communities|page=274}}</ref> At the ten schools in Aberdare there was accommodation for only 1,317 children, a small proportion of the population. Largely as a result of these criticisms, the main nonconformist denominations worked together to establish a British School, known locally as Ysgol y Comin, which was opened in 1848, accommodating 200 pupils. Funds were raised which largely cleared the debts and the opening of the school was marked by a public meeting addressed by Price and [[David Williams (coal owner)|David Williams (''Alaw Goch'')]].<ref name=\"CMG 48 Brit school\">{{cite news|title=Aberdare British Schools|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3089330/ART23|accessdate=22 November 2013|newspaper=Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian|date=14 October 1848}}</ref>\n\nMuch energy was expended during this period on conflicts between Anglicans and nonconformists over education. The establishment of the [[Aberdare School Board]] in 1871 brought about an extension of educational provision but also intensified religious rivalries. School Board elections were invariably fought on religious grounds. Despite these tensions the Board took over a number of existing schools and established new ones. By 1889, fourteen schools were operated by the Board but truancy and lack of attendance remained a problem, as in many industrial districts.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parry|title=Labour Leaders and Local Politics|pages=401\u20132}}</ref>\n\nIn common with other public bodies at the time (see 'Local Government' above), membership of the School Board was dominated by coal owners and colliery officials, nonconformist ministers, professional men and tradesmen. Only occasionally was an Anglican clergyman elected and, with the exception of [[David Morgan (trade unionist)|David Morgan (''Dai o'r Nant'')]], no working class candidates were elected for more than one term.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parry|title=Labour Leaders and Local Politics|pages=401\u20135}}</ref>\n\n===Colleges===\n*[[Coleg y Cymoedd]]\n\n===Primary schools===\n*Abernant Primary School\n*Caradog primary school\n*Town Church primary school\n*St Margaret's Roman Catholic primary school\n*Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Aberdar\n*Blaengwawr Primary School\n*Oaklands Primary School\n*Cap Coach Primary School\n*Glynhafod Primary School\n*Cwmaman Infants School\n*Cwmdare Primary School\n*Aberdare Park Primary\n*Cwmbach Community Primary School\n\n===Secondary schools===\n\n*[[Aberdare Community School]]\n*[[St. John the Baptist School (Aberdare)]]\n*[[Ysgol Gyfun Rhydywaun]]\n\n==Transport==\nThe town is served by [[Aberdare railway station]] and [[Aberdare bus station]], opposite each other in the town centre.

The effect is typically much smaller than illustrated.]]\n\nThe '''aberration of light''' (also referred to as '''astronomical aberration''', '''stellar aberration''', or '''velocity aberration''') is an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] phenomenon which produces an [[apparent place|apparent motion]] of celestial objects about their true positions, dependent on the velocity of the observer. Aberration causes objects to appear to be displaced towards the direction of motion of the observer compared to when the observer is stationary. The change in angle is typically very small \u2014 of the order of ''v/c'' where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and ''v'' the [[velocity]] of the observer. In the case of \"stellar\" or \"annual\" aberration, the apparent position of a star to an observer on Earth varies periodically over the course of a year as the Earth's velocity changes as it [[orbital revolution|revolves]] around the Sun, by a maximum angle of approximately 20&nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s in [[right ascension]] or [[declination]].\n\nThe term ''aberration'' has historically been used to refer to a number of related phenomena concerning the propagation of light in moving bodies.<ref name=\"schaffner\">{{Citation\n|author=Schaffner, Kenneth F.\n|date=1972\n|title= Nineteenth-century aether theories\n|publisher=Pergamon Press\n|location= Oxford\n|pages=99\u2013117 und 255\u2013273\n|isbn=0-08-015674-6}}</ref> \nAberration should not be confused with ''[[stellar parallax|parallax]]''. The latter is a change in the apparent position of a relatively nearby object, as measured by a moving observer, relative to more distant objects that define a reference frame. The amount of parallax depends on the ''distance'' of the object from the observer, whereas aberration does not. Aberration is also related to [[light-time correction]] and [[relativistic beaming]], although it is often considered separately from these effects.\n\nAberration is historically significant because of its role in the development of the theories of [[light]], [[electromagnetism]] and, ultimately, the theory of [[special relativity]]. It was first observed in the late 1600s by astronomers searching for stellar parallax in order to confirm the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the Solar System.

G. Stokes]] (in 1845), and for [[Hendrik Lorentz]]'s [[Lorentz ether theory|aether theory]] of electromagnetism in 1892. The aberration of light, together with Lorentz's elaboration of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's electrodynamics]], the [[moving magnet and conductor problem]], the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment|negative aether drift experiments]], as well as the [[Fizeau experiment]], led [[Albert Einstein]] to develop the theory of special relativity in 1905, which presents a general form of the equation for aberration in terms of such theory.<ref name=\"norton\">{{Citation|author=Norton, John D. |date=2004 |first1=John D. |journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences |title=Einstein's Investigations of Galilean Covariant Electrodynamics prior to 1905 |pages=45\u2013105 |volume=59 |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001743/ |doi=10.1007/s00407-004-0085-6 |bibcode=2004AHES...59...45N |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111103932/http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001743/ |archivedate=2009-01-11 }}</ref>\n\n==Explanation==\n[[File:Sun earth relativistic aberration.svg|thumb|300px|Light rays striking the earth in the Sun's rest frame compared to the same rays in the Earth's rest frame according to special relativity. The effect is exaggerated for illustrative purposes.]]\n\nAberration may be explained as the difference in angle of a beam of light in different [[inertial frames of reference]]. A common analogy is to consider the apparent direction of falling rain. If rain is falling vertically in the frame of reference of a person standing still, then to a person moving forwards the rain will appear to arrive at an angle, requiring the moving observer to tilt their umbrella forwards. The faster the observer moves, the more tilt is needed.\n\nThe net effect is that light rays striking the moving observer from the sides in a stationary frame will come angled from ahead in the moving observer's frame. This effect is sometimes called the \"searchlight\" or \"headlight\" effect.\n\nIn the case of annual aberration of starlight, the direction of incoming starlight as seen in the Earth's moving frame is tilted relative to the angle observed in the Sun's frame. Since the direction of motion of the Earth changes during its orbit, the direction of this tilting changes during the course of the year, and causes the apparent position of the star to differ from its true position as measured in the inertial frame of the Sun.\n\nWhile classical reasoning gives intuition for aberration, it leads to a number of physical paradoxes observable even at the classical level (see [[#Historical_theories_of_aberration|history]]). The theory of [[special relativity]] is required to correctly account for aberration. The relativistic explanation is very similar to the classical one however, and in both theories aberration may be understood as a case of [[vector space|addition of velocities]].\n\n===Classical explanation===\nIn the Sun's frame, consider a beam of light with velocity equal to the speed of light c, with x and y velocity components <math>u_x</math> and <math>u_y</math>, at an angle <math>\\tan(\\theta) = u_y/u_x</math>. If the Earth is moving at velocity <math>v</math> in the x direction relative to the Sun, then by velocity addition the x component of the beam's velocity in the Earth's frame of reference is <math>u_x' = u_x - v</math>, and the y velocity is unchanged, <math>u_y' = u_y</math>. (Note that you need the velocity of the Sun with respect to the Earth which is the negative of the velocity of the Earth with respect to the Sun. Also note that we are only using vectors here without indication of direction.) Thus the angle of the light in the Earth's frame in terms of the angle in the Sun's frame is\n\n:<math>\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac{u_y'}{u_x'} = \\frac{u_y}{u_x-v} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)-v/c}</math>\n\nIn the case of <math>\\theta = 90^\\circ</math>, this result reduces to <math>\\tan(\\theta - \\phi) = -v/c</math>.\n\n===Relativistic explanation===\nThe reasoning in the relativistic case is the same except that the [[Velocity-addition formula|relativistic velocity addition]] formulas must be used, which can be derived from [[Lorentz transformations]] between different frames of reference. These formulae are\n\n:<math>u_x' = (u_x - v)/(1-u_x v/c^2)</math>\n:<math>u_y' = u_y / \\gamma (1-u_x v/c^2)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}</math>, giving the components of the light beam in the Earth's frame in terms of the components in the Sun's frame. The angle of the beam in the Earth's frame is thus <ref name=Mould>{{cite book |title=Basic Relativity |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lfGE-wyJYIUC&pg=PA8 |isbn=0-387-95210-1 |date=2001 |publisher=Springer |author=Richard A. Mould |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac{u_y'}{u_x'} = \\frac{u_y}{\\gamma(u_x-v)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\gamma(\\cos(\\theta)-v/c)}</math>\n\nIn the case of <math>\\theta = 90^\\circ</math>, this result reduces to <math>\\sin(\\theta - \\phi) = -v/c</math>, and in the limit <math>v/c \\ll 1</math> this may be approximated by <math>\\theta - \\phi = -v/c</math>. This relativistic derivation keeps the speed of light <math>\\sqrt{u_x^2 + u_y^2} = c</math> constant in all frames of reference, unlike the classical derivation above.\n\n===Relationship to light-time correction and relativistic beaming===\n[[File:aberrationlighttimebeaming.gif|thumb|400px|Aberration, light-time correction, and relativistic beaming can be considered the same phenomenon depending on the frame of reference.]]\n\nAberration is related to two other phenomena, [[light-time correction]], which is due to the motion of an observed object during the time taken by its light to reach an observer, and [[relativistic beaming]], which is an angling of the light emitted by a moving light source. It can be considered equivalent to them but in a different inertial frame of reference. In aberration, the observer is considered to be moving relative to a (for the sake of simplicity<ref>In fact, the light source doesn't need to be stationary, consider for example eclipsing binary stars: they are rotating with high speed \u2014and ever changing and different velocity vectors\u2014 around each other, but they appear as '''one''' spot all the time.</ref>) stationary light source, while in light-time correction and relativistic beaming the light source is considered to be moving relative to a stationary observer.\n\nConsider the case of an observer and a light source moving relative to each other at constant velocity, with a light beam moving from the source to the observer. At the moment of emission, the beam in the observer's rest frame is tilted compared to the one in the source's rest frame, as understood through relativistic beaming. During the time it takes the light beam to reach the observer the light source moves in the observer's frame, and the 'true position' of the light source is displaced relative to the apparent position the observer sees, as explained by light-time correction. Finally, the beam in the observer's frame at the moment of observation is tilted compared to the beam in source's frame, which can be understood as an aberrational effect. Thus, a person in the light source's frame would describe the apparent tilting of the beam in terms of aberration, while a person in the observer's frame would describe it as a light-time effect.\n\nThe relationship between these phenomena is only valid if the observer and source's frames are inertial frames. In practice, because the Earth is not an inertial rest frame but experiences centripetal [[acceleration]] towards the Sun, many aberrational effects such as annual aberration on Earth cannot be considered light-time corrections. However, if the time between emission and detection of the light is short compared to the orbital period of the Earth, the Earth may be approximated as an inertial frame and aberrational effects are equivalent to light-time corrections.\n\n==Types of aberration==\nThere are a number of types of aberration, caused by the differing components of the Earth's and observed object's motion:\n\n* '''Annual aberration''' is due to the orbital [[orbit|revolution]] of the Earth around the Sun.\n* '''Planetary aberration''' is the combination of aberration and light-time correction.\n* '''Diurnal aberration''' is due to the [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] of the Earth about its own axis.\n* '''Secular aberration''' is due to the motion of the Sun and [[Solar System]] relative to other stars in our [[Galaxy]].\n\n===Annual aberration===\n[[File:Aberration3.svg|thumb|250px|Stars at the [[ecliptic pole]]s appear to move in circles, stars exactly in the ecliptic plane move in lines, and stars at intermediate angles move in ellipses. Shown here are the apparent motions of stars with the [[ecliptic latitude]]s corresponding to these cases, and with [[ecliptic longitude]] of 270\u00b0.]]\n[[File:aberrationseasons.svg|thumb|250px|The direction of aberration of a star at the northern ecliptic pole differs at different times of the year]]\n{{see also|Stellar parallax}}\n\nAnnual aberration is caused by the motion of an observer on [[Earth]] as the planet revolves around the [[Sun]]. Due to [[orbital eccentricity]], the [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] <math>v</math> of Earth (in the Sun's rest frame) [[Kepler orbit|varies]] periodically during the year as the planet traverses its [[elliptic orbit]] and consequently the aberration also varies periodically, typically causing stars to [[stellar parallax|appear to move]] in small [[ellipse]]s.\n\nApproximating [[Earth's orbit]] as circular, the maximum displacement of a star due to annual aberration is known as the ''constant of aberration'', conventionally represented by <math>\\kappa</math>. It may be calculated using the relation <math>\\kappa = \\theta-\\phi \\approx v/c </math> substituting the Earth's average speed in the Sun's frame for <math>v</math> and the [[speed of light]] <math>c</math>. Its accepted value is 20.49552 &nbsp;[[minute and second of atc|arcseconds]] (at [[J2000]]).<ref name=\"kovalevsky\">{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Kovalevsky |first2=P. Kenneth |last2=Seidelmann |last-author-amp=yes |date=2004 |title=Fundamentals of Astrometry\n|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-64216-7}}</ref>\n\nAssuming a [[circular orbit]], annual aberration causes stars exactly on the [[ecliptic]] (the plane of Earth's orbit) to appear to move back and forth along a straight line, varying by <math>\\kappa</math> on either side of their position in the Sun's frame. A star that is precisely at one of the [[ecliptic pole]]s (at 90\u00b0 from the ecliptic plane) will appear to move in a circle of radius <math>\\kappa</math> about its true position, and stars at intermediate [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitudes]] will appear to move along a small [[ellipse]].\n\nFor illustration, consider a star at the northern ecliptic pole viewed by an observer at a point on the [[Arctic Circle]]. Such an observer will see the star [[culmination|transit]] at the [[zenith]], once every day (strictly speaking [[sidereal day]]). At the time of the [[March equinox]], Earth's orbit carries the observer in a southwards direction, and the star's apparent [[declination]] is therefore displaced to the south by an angle of <math>\\kappa</math>. On the [[September equinox]], the star's position is displaced to the north by an equal and opposite amount. On either [[solstice]], the displacement in declination is 0. Conversely, the amount of displacement in [[right ascension]] is 0 on either [[equinox]] and at maximum on either solstice.\n\n<!-- In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the aberration's effect in [[right ascension]] (east-west) is larger than the effect in [[declination]] (north-south) except at the ecliptic poles. Despite this, its effect in declination was the first observed because very accurate clocks are needed to measure such a small variation in right ascension, but a [[transit telescope]] calibrated with a [[plumb bob|plumb line]] can detect very small changes in declination.\n-->\nIn actuality, Earth's orbit is slightly elliptic rather than circular, and its speed varies somewhat over the course of its orbit, which means the description above is only approximate. Aberration is more accurately calculated using  Earth's instantaneous velocity relative to the [[barycenter]] of the Solar System.<ref name=kovalevsky/>\n\nNote that the displacement due to aberration is orthogonal to any displacement due to [[parallax]]. If parallax were detectable, the maximum displacement to the south would occur in December, and the maximum displacement to the north in June. It is this apparently anomalous motion that so mystified early astronomers.\n\n====Solar annual aberration====\nA special case of annual aberration is the nearly constant deflection of the Sun from its position in the Sun's rest frame by <math>\\kappa</math> towards the ''west'' (as viewed from Earth), opposite to the apparent motion of the Sun along the ecliptic (which is from west to east, as seen from Earth). The deflection thus makes the Sun appear to be behind (or retarded) from its rest-frame position on the ecliptic by a position or angle <math>\\kappa</math>.\n\nThis deflection may equivalently be described as a light-time effect due to motion of the Earth during the 8.3&nbsp;minutes that it takes light to travel from the Sun to Earth. This is possible since the transit time of sunlight is short relative to the orbital period of the Earth, so the Earth's frame may be approximated as inertial. In the Earth's frame, the Sun moves by a distance <math>\\Delta x = vt</math> in the time it takes light to reach Earth, <math>t=R/c</math> for the orbit of radius <math>R</math>. This gives an angular correction <math>\\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta = \\Delta x/R</math> which can be solved to give <math>\\theta = v/c = \\kappa</math>, the same as the aberrational correction.\n\n===Planetary aberration===\n{{see also|Light-time correction}}\nPlanetary aberration is the combination of the aberration of light (due to Earth's velocity) and light-time correction (due to the object's motion and distance), as calculated in the rest frame of the Solar System. Both are determined at the instant when the moving object's light reaches the moving observer on Earth. It is so called because it is usually applied to planets and other objects in the Solar System whose motion and distance are accurately known.\n\n===Diurnal aberration===\nDiurnal aberration is caused by the velocity of the observer on the surface of the [[Earth's rotation|rotating Earth]]. It is therefore dependent not only on the time of the observation, but also the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the observer. Its effect is much smaller than that of annual aberration, and is only 0.32 [[minute and second of arc|arcseconds]] in the case of an observer at the [[Equator]], where the rotational velocity is greatest.<ref name=newcomb/>\n\n===Secular aberration===\nThe Sun and Solar System are revolving around the center of the Galaxy. Aberration due to this motion is known as secular aberration and affects the apparent positions of distant stars and [[extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic]] objects. However, since the [[galactic year]] is about 230 million years, the aberration varies very slowly and this change is extremely difficult to observe. Therefore, secular aberration is usually ignored when considering the positions of stars. In other words, star maps show the observed apparent positions of the stars, not their calculated true positions after accounting for secular aberration.\n\nFor stars significantly less than 230 million [[light years]] away, the Solar System may be approximated as an inertial frame and so the effect of secular aberration is equivalent to a light-time correction. This includes stars in the [[Milky Way]], since the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years in diameter. For these stars the true position of the star is then easily computed from its [[proper motion]] and its distance.\n\nSecular aberration is typically a small number of [[arcminutes]], for example the stationary star [[Groombridge 1830]] is displaced by approximately 3&nbsp;arcminutes,<ref name=\"newcomb\">\n{{cite book\n|last=Newcomb\n|first=Simon \n|authorlink= Simon Newcomb\n|title=A Compendium of Spherical Astronomy\n|date=1960 \n|publisher=Macmillan, 1906 \u2013 republished by [[Dover Publications|Dover]]}}</ref> due to secular aberration. This is roughly 8 times the effect of annual aberration, as one would expect since the velocity of the Solar System relative to the center of the Galaxy is about 8 times the velocity of the Earth relative to the Sun.\n\n==Discovery and first observations==\nThe discovery of the aberration of light was totally unexpected, and it was only by considerable perseverance and perspicacity that [[James Bradley|Bradley]] was able to explain it in 1727. It originated from attempts to discover whether stars possessed appreciable [[stellar parallax|parallaxes]].\n\n===Search for stellar parallax===\nThe [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] [[heliocentricity|heliocentric]] theory of the [[Solar System]] had received confirmation by the observations of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] and the mathematical investigations of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=54}} As early as 1573, [[Thomas Digges]] had suggested that parallactic shifting of the stars should occur according to the heliocentric model, and consequently if stellar parallax could be observed it would help confirm this theory.  Many observers claimed to have determined such parallaxes, but Tycho Brahe and [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] concluded that they existed only in the minds of the observers, and were due to instrumental and personal errors. However, in 1680 [[Jean Picard]], in his ''Voyage d\u2019[[Uraniborg|Uranibourg]],'' stated, as a result of ten [[year]]s' observations, that [[Polaris]], the Pole Star, exhibited variations in its position amounting to 40\u2033 annually. Some astronomers endeavoured to explain this by parallax, but these attempts failed because the motion differed from that which parallax would produce. [[John Flamsteed]], from measurements made in 1689 and succeeding years with his mural quadrant, similarly concluded that the declination of Polaris was 40\u2033 less in July than in September. [[Robert Hooke]], in 1674, published his observations of [[Gamma Draconis|\u03b3 Draconis]], a star of [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 2<sup>m</sup> which passes practically overhead at the latitude of London (hence its observations are largely free from the complex corrections due to [[atmospheric refraction]]), and concluded that this star was 23\u2033 more northerly in July than in October.{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=54}}\n\n===James Bradley's observations===\n[[File:Bradley's observations of \u03b3 Draconis and 35 Camelopardalis as reduced by Busch.jpg|thumb|Bradley's observations of \u03b3 Draconis and 35 Camelopardalis as reduced by Busch to the year 1730.]]\n\nConsequently, when Bradley and [[Samuel Molyneux]] entered this sphere of research in 1725, there was still considerable uncertainty as to whether stellar parallaxes had been observed or not, and it was with the intention of definitely answering this question that they erected a large telescope at Molyneux's house at [[Kew]].<ref name=\"Hirshfeld\"/> They decided to reinvestigate the motion of \u03b3 Draconis with a telescope constructed by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] (1675\u20131751), a celebrated instrument-maker. This was fixed to a vertical chimney stack in such manner as to permit a small oscillation of the eyepiece, the amount of which (i.e. the deviation from the vertical) was regulated and measured by the introduction of a screw and a plumb line.{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=54}}\n\nThe instrument was set up in November 1725, and observations on \u03b3 Draconis were made starting in December. The star was observed to move 40\u2033 southwards between September and March, and then reversed its course from March to September. {{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=54}} At the same time, [[HD 40873|35 Camelopardalis]], a star with a right ascension nearly exactly opposite to that of \u03b3 Draconis, was 19\" more northerly at the beginning of March than in September.<ref>Bradley, James; Rigaud, Stephen Peter (1832). Miscellaneous works and correspondence of the Rev. James Bradley, D.D., F.R.S. Oxford: University Press. p. 11.</ref> These results were completely unexpected and inexplicable by existing theories.\n\n===Early hypotheses===\n[[File:Hypothetical movement of \u03b3 Draconis caused by parallax.jpg|thumb|Hypothetical observation of \u03b3 Draconis if its movement was caused by parallax.]]\n\n[[File:Hypothetical movement of \u03b3 Draconis and 35 Camelopardalis caused by nutation.jpg|thumb|Hypothetical observation of \u03b3 Draconis and 35 Camelopardalis if their movements were caused by nutation.]]\n\nBradley and Molyneux discussed several hypotheses in the hope of finding the solution. Since the apparent motion was evidently caused neither by parallax nor observational errors, Bradley first hypothesized that it could be due to oscillations in the orientation of the Earth's axis relative to the celestial sphere&nbsp;\u2013 a phenomenon known as [[astronomical nutation|nutation]]. 35 Camelopardalis was seen to possess an apparent motion which could be consistent with nutation, but since its declination varied only one half as much as that of \u03b3 Draconis, it was obvious that nutation did not supply the answer{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=55}} (however, Bradley later went on to discover that the Earth does indeed nutate).<ref name=berry/> He also investigated the possibility that the motion was due to an irregular distribution of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], thus involving abnormal variations in the refractive index, but again obtained negative results.{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=55}}\n\nOn August 19, 1727, Bradley embarked upon a further series of observations using a telescope of his own erected at the Rectory, [[Wanstead]]. This instrument had the advantage of a larger field of view and he was able to obtain precise positions of a large number of stars over the course of about twenty years. During his first two years at Wanstead, he established the existence of the phenomenon of aberration beyond all doubt, and this also enabled him to formulate a set of rules that would allow the calculation of the effect on any given star at a specified date.\n\n===Development of the theory of aberration===\nBradley eventually developed his explanation of aberration in about September 1728 and this theory was presented to the [[Royal Society]] in mid January the following year. One well-known story was that he saw the change of direction of a wind vane on a boat on the Thames, caused not by an alteration of the wind itself, but by a change of course of the boat relative to the wind direction.<ref name=\"berry\">\n{{cite book\n|last=Berry\n|first=Arthur \n|title=A Short History of Astronomy\n|date=1961\n|orig-year=1898\n|publisher=[[Dover Publications|Dover]]}}</ref>\nHowever, there is no record of this incident in Bradley's own account of the discovery, and it may therefore be [[apocrypha]]l.\n\nThe following table shows the magnitude of deviation from true declination for \u03b3 Draconis and the direction, on the planes of the solstitial [[colure]] and ecliptic prime meridian, of the tangent of the velocity of the Earth in its orbit for each of the four months where the extremes are found, as well as expected deviation from true ecliptic longitude if Bradley had measured its deviation from right ascension:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is also worth noting that part of the original motivation of the search for stellar parallax was to test the Copernican theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun, but of course the existence of aberration also establishes the truth of that theory.\n\n==Historical theories of aberration==\nThe phenomenon of aberration became a driving force for many physical theories during the 200 years between its observation and the conclusive explanation by Albert Einstein.\n\nThe first classical explanation was provided in 1729, by James Bradley as described above, who attributed it to the finite [[speed of light]] and the motion of [[Earth]] in its orbit around the [[Sun]].<ref name=\"Bradley\"/><ref name=\"Hirshfeld\"/> However, this explanation proved inaccurate once the wave nature of light was better understood, and correcting it became a major goal of the 19th century theories of [[luminiferous aether]]. [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] proposed a correction due to the motion of a medium (the aether) through which light propagated, known as [[Aether drag hypothesis|\"partial aether drag\"]]. He proposed that objects partially drag the aether along with them as they move, and this became the accepted explanation for aberration for some time. [[George Gabriel Stokes|George Stokes]] proposed a similar theory, explaining that aberration occurs due to the flow of aether induced by the motion of the Earth. Accumulated evidence against these explanations, combined with new understanding of the electromagnetic nature of light, led [[Hendrik Lorentz]] to develop an [[Lorentz ether theory|electron theory]] which featured an immobile aether, and he explained that objects contract in length as they move through the aether. Motivated by these previous theories, [[Albert Einstein]] then developed the theory of [[special relativity]] in 1905, which provides the modern account of aberration.\n\n===Bradley's classical explanation===\n[[File:Stellar aberration.JPG|thumb|250px |Figure 2: As light propagates down the telescope, the telescope moves requiring a tilt to the telescope that depends on the speed of light. The apparent angle of the star ''\u03c6'' differs from its true angle ''\u03b8''.]]\n\nBradley conceived of an explanation in terms of a [[corpuscular theory of light]] in which light is made of particles unaffected by gravity.<ref name=\"schaffner\"/> His classical explanation appeals to the motion of the earth relative to a beam of light-particles moving at a finite velocity, and is developed in the Sun's frame of reference, unlike the classical derivation given above.\n\nConsider the case where a distant star is motionless relative to the Sun, and the star is extremely far away, so that parallax may be ignored. In the rest frame of the Sun, this means light from the star travels in parallel paths to the Earth observer, and arrives at the same angle regardless of where the Earth is in its orbit. Suppose the star is observed on Earth with a telescope, idealized as a narrow tube. The light enters the tube from the star at angle <math>\\theta</math> and travels at speed <math>c</math> taking a time <math>h/c</math> to reach the bottom of the tube, where it is detected. Suppose observations are made from Earth, which is moving with a speed <math>v</math>. During the transit of the light, the tube moves a distance <math>vh/c</math>. Consequently, for the particles of light to reach the bottom of the tube, the tube must be inclined at an angle <math>\\phi</math> different from <math>\\theta</math>, resulting in an ''apparent'' position of the star at angle <math>\\phi</math>. As the Earth proceeds in its orbit it changes direction, so <math>\\phi</math> changes with the time of year the observation is made. The apparent angle and true angle are related using trigonometry as:\n\n:<math>\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac { h\\sin(\\theta)}{hv/c + h \\cos (\\theta)}=\\frac { \\sin(\\theta)}{v/c +  \\cos (\\theta)}</math>.\n\nIn the case of <math>\\theta = 90^\\circ</math>, this gives <math>\\tan(\\theta - \\phi) = v/c</math>. While this is different from the more accurate relativistic result described above, in the limit of small angle and low velocity they are approximately the same, within the error of the measurements of Bradley's day. These results allowed Bradley to make one of the earliest measurements of the [[Speed of light#History|speed of light]].<ref name=J_Bradley>{{cite journal |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=35 |pages=637\u2013661 |date=1729 |author =James Bradley |title=An account of a new discovered motion of the fixed stars |doi=10.1098/rstl.1727.0064}}</ref><ref name=Britannica>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/76818/James-Bradley/76818rellinks/Related-Links Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111091006/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/76818/James-Bradley/76818rellinks/Related-Links |date=2013-11-11 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- \n[[File:Aberration1.svg|frame|right|Figure 1. Diagram illustrating stellar aberration]]\nOn the left side of Figure 1, the case of infinite light speed is shown. '''S''' represents the '''s'''pot where the star light enters the telescope, and '''E''' the position of the '''e'''ye piece. If light moves instantaneously, the telescope does not move, and the true direction of the star relative to the observer can be found by following the line '''ES'''. However, if light travels at finite speed, the Earth, and therefore the eye piece of the telescope, moves from '''E''' to '''E\u2032''' during the time it takes light to travel from '''S''' to '''E'''. Consequently, the star will no longer appear in the center of the eye piece. The telescope must therefore be adjusted. When the telescope is at position '''E''' it must be oriented toward spot '''S\u2032''' so that the star light enters the telescope at spot '''S\u2032'''. The star light will travel along the line '''SE\u2032''' and reach '''E\u2032''' exactly when the moving eye piece also reaches '''E\u2032'''. Since the telescope has been adjusted by the angle '''SES\u2032''', the star's apparent position is hence displaced by the same angle.\n\nFor the simple case where the direction of the light beam along the line '''SE''' is perpendicular to the motion of the observer then only light emitted at an angle equal to the arc cosine of the ratio of the observer's speed to the speed of light will reach the telescope. Consequently, the telescope too must be oriented at this same angle away from the light beam's trajectory in the direction of the motion to capture this emitted light.<ref>Tolman, R.C., \"The theory of the relativity of motion\", University of California Press, Berkeley (1917), p.59</ref>-->\n=== Luminiferous aether ===\n{{See also|Luminiferous aether}}\n\n[[File:Stellar aberration versus the dragged aether.gif|thumb|250px|Young reasoned that aberration could only be explained if the aether were immobile in the frame of the Sun. On the left, stellar aberration occurs if an immobile aether is assumed, showing that the telescope must be tilted. On the right, the aberration disappears if the aether moves with the telescope, and the telescope does not need to be tilted.]]\nIn the early nineteenth century the wave theory of light was being rediscovered, and in 1804 [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] adapted Bradley's explanation for corpuscular light to wavelike light traveling through a medium known as the luminiferous aether. His reasoning was the same as Bradley's, but it required that this medium be immobile in the Sun's reference frame and must pass through the earth unaffected, otherwise the medium (and therefore the light) would move along with the earth and no aberration would be observed. \n<ref name=\"whittaker\">{{Citation\n |author=Whittaker, Edmund Taylor \n |date=1910 \n |title=A History of the theories of aether and electricity \n |edition=1. \n |location=Dublin \n |publisher=Longman, Green and Co. \n |url=https://archive.org/details/historyoftheorie00whitrich \n |deadurl=no \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215173309/https://archive.org/details/historyoftheorie00whitrich \n |archivedate=2016-02-15 \n}}<br />{{cite book |last=Whittaker |first=Edmund Taylor |title=A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity| edition=2.| date=1953 |publisher=T.

An important example is of a telescope filled with water. The velocity of the light in such a telescope will be slower than in vacuum, and is given by <math>c/n</math> rather than <math>c</math> where <math>n</math> is the index of refraction of the water. Thus, by Bradley and Young's reasoning the aberration angle is given by\n\n:<math>\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac { \\sin(\\theta)}{v/(c/n) +  \\cos (\\theta)}</math>.\n\nwhich predicts a medium-dependent angle of aberration. When refraction at the telescope's [[Objective (optics)|objective]] is taken into account this result deviates even more from the vacuum result. In 1810 [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago]] performed a similar experiment and found that the aberration was unaffected by the medium in the telescope, providing solid evidence against Young's theory. This experiment was subsequently verified by many others in the following decades, most accurately by [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]] in 1871, with the same result.<ref name=\"whittaker\"/>\n\n===Aether drag models===\n{{See also|Aether drag hypothesis}}\n\n====Fresnel's aether drag====\nIn 1818, [[Augustin Fresnel]] developed a modified explanation to account for the water telescope and for other aberration phenomena. He explained that the aether is generally at rest in the Sun's frame of reference, but objects partially drag the aether along with them as they move. That is, the aether in an object of index of refraction <math>n</math> moving at velocity <math>v</math> is partially dragged with a velocity <math>(1-1/n^2)v</math> bringing the light along with it. This factor is known as \"Fresnel's dragging coefficient\". This dragging effect, along with refraction at the telescope's objective, compensates for the slower speed of light in the water telescope in Bradley's explanation.{{efn|\nMore in detail, Fresnel explains that the incoming light of angle <math>\\theta</math> is first refracted at the end of the telescope, to a new angle <math>\\psi</math> within the telescope. This may be accounted for by [[Snell's law]], giving <math>\\sin(\\theta - \\phi) = n \\sin(\\psi - \\phi)</math>. Then drag must be accounted for. Without drag, the x and y components of the light in the telescope are <math>(c/n) \\sin(\\psi)</math> and <math>(c/n) \\cos(\\psi)</math>, but drag modifies the x component to <math>(c/n) \\cos(\\psi) - (1-1/n^2)v</math> if the Earth moves with velocity <math>v</math>. If <math>\\alpha</math> is angle and <math>v_l</math> is the velocity of the light with these velocity components, then by Bradley's reasoning\n<math>\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac { h \\sin(\\alpha)}{v t +  h \\cos (\\alpha)}</math> \nwhere <math>h</math> is the modified path length through the water and t is the time it takes the light to travel the distance h, <math>t = h/v_l</math>. Upon solving these equations for <math>\\phi</math> in terms of <math>\\theta</math> one obtains Bradley's vacuum result.\n\n<!--Even more in detail: By trigonometry,\n:<math>\\sin(\\alpha) = (c/n) \\sin(\\psi)/v_l</math>\n:<math>\\cos(\\alpha) = ((c/n) \\cos(\\psi) - (1-1/n^2)v)/v_l</math>\nPlugging these into the first equation gives\n:<math>\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac { \\sin(\\psi)}{v/nc + \\cos (\\psi)}</math>.\nand then incorporating Snell's law gives Bradley's vacuum result.-->\n\n}}     With this modification Fresnel obtained Bradley's vacuum result even for non-vacuum telescopes, and was also able to predict many other phenomena related to the propagation of light in moving bodies. Fresnel's dragging coefficient became the dominant explanation of aberration for the next decades.\n\n[[File:Stokes aether drag.svg|thumb|250px|Conceptual illustration of Stokes' aether drag theory. In the rest frame of the Sun the Earth moves to the right through the aether, in which it induces a local current. A ray of light (in red) coming from the vertical becomes dragged and tilted due to the flow of aether.]]\n\n====Stokes' aether drag====\nHowever, the fact that light is [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] (discovered by Fresnel himself) led scientists such as [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] and [[George Green (mathematician)|Green]] to believe that the aether was a totally immobile elastic solid as opposed to Fresnel's fluid aether. There was thus renewed need for an explanation of aberration consistent both with Fresnel's predictions (and Arago's observations) as well as polarization.\n\nIn 1845, [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|Stokes]] proposed a 'putty-like' aether which acts as a liquid on large scales but as a solid on small scales, thus supporting both the transverse vibrations required for polarized light and the aether flow required to explain aberration. Making only the assumptions that the fluid is [[Potential flow|irrotational]] and that the [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] of the flow are such that the aether has zero velocity far from the Earth, but moves at the Earth's velocity at its surface and within it, he was able to completely account for aberration.{{efn|\n[[File:Stokes aether drag proof.svg|center|600px|The propagating wavefront moving through the aether.]]\nStokes' derivation may be summarized as follows: Consider a wavefront moving in the downwards z direction. Say the aether has velocity field <math>u,v,w</math> as a function of <math>x,y,z</math>. Now, motion of the aether in the x and y directions does not affect the wavefront, but the motion in the z direction advances it (in addition to the amount it advances at speed c). If the z velocity of the aether varies over space, for example if it is slower for higher x as shown in the figure, then the wavefront becomes angled, by an angle <math>\\tan(\\alpha) = tdw/dx </math>. Now, say in time t the wavefront has moved by a span <math>dz \\approx c t</math> (assuming the speed of the aether is negligible compared to the speed of light). Then for each distance <math>dz</math> the ray descends, it is bent by an angle <math>\\alpha \\approx (dw/dx) (dz/c)</math>, and so the total angle by which it has changed after travelling through the entire fluid is\n\n:<math> \\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{c} \\int \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} dz</math>\n\nIf the fluid is [[Potential flow|irrotational]] it will satisfy the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]], one of which is\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}</math>.\n\nInserting this into the previous result gives an aberration angle <math> \\alpha = (u_2 - u_1)/c</math> where the <math>u</math>s represent the x component of the aether's velocity at the start and end of the ray. Far from the earth the aether has zero velocity, so <math>u_2 = 0</math> and at the surface of the earth it has the earth's velocity <math>v</math>. Thus we finally get\n\n:<math> \\alpha \\approx \\frac{v}{c}</math>\n\nwhich is the known aberration result. \n}}\nThe velocity of the aether outside of the Earth would decrease as a function of distance from the Earth so light rays from stars would be progressively dragged as they approached the surface of the Earth. The Earth's motion would be unaffected by the aether due to [[D'Alembert's paradox]].\n\nBoth Fresnel and Stokes' theories were popular. However, the question of aberration was put aside during much of the second half of the 19th century as focus of inquiry turned to the electromagnetic properties of aether.\n\n===Lorentz' length contraction===\n{{See also|Lorentz ether theory}}\nIn the 1880s once electromagnetism was better understood, interest turned again to the problem of aberration. By this time flaws were known to both Fresnel's and Stokes' theories. Fresnel's theory required that the relative velocity of aether and matter to be different for light of different colors, and it was shown that the boundary conditions Stokes had assumed in his theory were inconsistent with his assumption of irrotational flow.<ref name=\"schaffner\"/><ref name=\"whittaker\"/><ref name=Jan>{{Citation|author=Janssen, Michel|author2=Stachel, John|last-author-amp=yes |editor=John Stachel |title=Going Critical |publisher=Springer|isbn=1-4020-1308-6|date=2010|chapter=The Optics and Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies|chapter-url=http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P265.PDF}}</ref> At the same time, the modern theories of electromagnetic aether could not account for aberration at all. Many scientists such as [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], [[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]] and [[Heinrich Hertz|Hertz]] unsuccessfully attempted to solve these problems by incorporating either Fresnel or Stokes' theories into [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's new electromagnetic laws]].\n\nHendrik Lorentz spent considerable effort along these lines. After working on this problem for a decade, the issues with Stokes' theory caused him to abandon it and to follow Fresnel's suggestion of a (mostly) stationary aether (1892, 1895). However, in Lorentz's model the aether was ''completely'' immobile, like the electromagnetic aethers of Cauchy, Green and Maxwell and unlike Fresnel's aether. He obtained Fresnel's dragging coefficient from modifications of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, including a modification of the time coordinates in moving frames (\"local time\"). In order to explain the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]] (1887), which apparently contradicted both Fresnel's and Lorentz's immobile aether theories, and apparently confirmed Stokes' complete aether drag, Lorentz theorized (1892) that objects undergo \"[[length contraction]]\" by a factor of <math>\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}</math> in the direction of their motion through the aether. In this way, aberration (and all related optical phenomena) can be accounted for in the context of an immobile aether. Lorentz' theory became the basis for much research in the next decade, and beyond. Its predictions for aberration are identical to those of the relativistic theory.<ref name=\"whittaker\"/><ref>{{Citation\n|author=Darrigol, Olivier\n|date=2000\n|title= Electrodynamics from Amp\u00e9re to Einstein\n|location=Oxford\n|publisher=Clarendon Press\n|isbn=0-19-850594-9}}</ref>\n\n===Special relativity===\n{{See also|History of special relativity}}\n\nLorentz' theory matched experiment well, but it was complicated and made many unsubstantiated physical assumptions about the microscopic nature of electromagnetic media. In his 1905 theory of special relativity, Albert Einstein reinterpreted the results of Lorentz' theory in a much simpler and more natural conceptual framework which disposed of the idea of an aether. His derivation is given [[Aberration_of_light#Relativistic_explanation|above]], and is now the accepted explanation. [[Robert S. Shankland]] reported some conversations with Einstein, in which Einstein emphasized the importance of aberration:<ref name=shank>{{Cite journal|author=Shankland, R.

Einstein wrote in a note in 1952:<ref name=\"norton\" />\n\n{{Quote|My own thought was more indirectly influenced by the famous Michelson-Morley experiment.

My direct path to the sp. th. rel. was mainly determined by the conviction that the electromotive force induced in a conductor moving in a magnetic field is nothing other than an electric field. But the result of Fizeau\u2019s experiment and the phenomenon of aberration also guided me.}}\n\nWhile Einstein's result is the same as Bradley's original equation except for an extra factor of <math>\\gamma</math>, it should be emphasized that Bradley's result does not merely give the classical limit of the relativistic case, in the sense that it gives incorrect predictions even at low relative velocities. Bradley's explanation cannot account for situations such as the water telescope, nor for many other optical effects (such as interference) that might occur within the telescope. This is because in the Earth's frame it predicts that the direction of propagation of the light beam in the telescope is not normal to the wavefronts of the beam, in contradiction with [[Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism]]. It also does not preserve the speed of light c between frames. However, Bradley did correctly infer that the effect was due to relative velocities.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons|Aberration of light}}\n* [[Apparent place]]\n* [[Stellar parallax]]\n* [[Astronomical nutation]]\n* [[Proper motion]]\n* [[Timeline of electromagnetism and classical optics]]\n* [[Stellar aberration (derivation from Lorentz transformation)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* P.

These deviations from the idealized lens performance are called ''aberrations'' of the lens.\n\nAberrations fall into two classes: ''monochromatic'' and ''chromatic''. Monochromatic aberrations are caused by the geometry of the lens or mirror and occur both when light is reflected and when it is refracted. They appear even when using [[monochromatic light]], hence the name.\n\n[[Chromatic aberration]]s are caused by [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], the variation of a lens's [[refractive index]] with [[wavelength]]. Because of dispersion, different wavelengths of light come to focus at different points. Chromatic aberration does not appear when monochromatic light is used.\n\n===Monochromatic aberrations===\n\nThe most common monochromatic aberrations are:\n\n*[[Defocus aberration|Defocus]]\n*[[Spherical aberration]]\n*[[Coma (optics)|Coma]]\n*[[Astigmatism (optical systems)|Astigmatism]]\n*[[Field curvature]]\n*[[Image distortion]]\n\nAlthough defocus is technically the lowest-order of the optical aberrations, it is usually not considered as a lens aberration, since it can be corrected by moving the lens (or the image plane) to bring the image plane to the optical focus of the lens.\n\nIn addition to these aberrations, [[Piston (optics)|piston]] and [[Tilt (optics)|tilt]] are effects which shift the position of the focal point.  Piston and tilt are not true optical aberrations, since when an otherwise perfect wavefront is altered by piston and tilt, it will still form a perfect, aberration-free image, only shifted to a different position.\n\n===Chromatic aberrations===\n{{main article|Chromatic aberration}}\n\nChromatic aberration occurs when different wavelengths are not focussed to the same point.  Types of chromatic aberration are:\n*Axial (or \"longitudinal\") chromatic aberration\n*Lateral (or \"transverse\") chromatic aberration\n\n==Theory of monochromatic aberration==\nA perfect optical system would follow the theorem: Rays of light proceeding from any ''object point'' unite in an ''image point''; and therefore the ''object space'' is reproduced in an ''image space.'' The introduction of simple auxiliary terms, due to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]],<ref>Gauss, Carl Friedrich (1841), ''Dioptrische Untersuchungen'', G\u00f6ttingen.</ref> named the [[focal length]]s and [[focal plane]]s, permits the determination of the image of any object for any system (see [[Lens (optics)|lens]]). The Gaussian theory, however, is only true so long as the angles made by all rays with the optical axis (the symmetrical axis of the system) are infinitely small, ''i.e''. with infinitesimal objects, images and lenses; in practice these conditions may not be realized, and the images projected by uncorrected systems are, in general, ill-defined and often completely blurred, if the aperture or field of view exceeds certain limits.\n\nThe investigations of [[James Clerk Maxwell]]<ref>Maxwell, James Clerk (1856) ''Phil.Mag.,'' and (1858) ''Quart. Journ. Math.''.</ref> and [[Ernst Abbe]]<ref>The investigations of Ernst Abbe on geometrical optics, originally published only in his university lectures, were first compiled by S. Czapski in 1893. See full reference below.</ref> showed that the properties of these reproductions, ''i.e''. the relative position and magnitude of the images, are not special properties of optical systems, but necessary consequences of the supposition (per Abbe) of the reproduction of all points of a space in image points, and are independent of the manner in which the reproduction is effected.  These authors showed, however, that no optical system can justify these suppositions, since they are contradictory to the fundamental laws of reflection and refraction.  Consequently, the Gaussian theory only supplies a convenient method of approximating to reality; and actual optical systems can only attempt to realize this unattainable ideal.  At present, all that can be attempted is to reproduce a single plane in another plane; but even this has not been altogether satisfactorily accomplished: aberrations always occur, and it is improbable that these will ever be entirely corrected.\n\nThe classical theory of optics and related systems been analyzed by numerous authors.<ref>Thiesen, M.

If there is refraction at a collective spherical surface, or through a thin positive lens, O'2 will lie in front of O'1 so long as the angle u2 is greater than u1 (''under correction''); and conversely with a dispersive surface or lenses (''over correction'').  The caustic, in the first case, resembles the sign > (greater than); in the second < (less than).  If the angle u1 is very small, O'1 is the Gaussian image; and O'1 O'2 is termed the ''longitudinal aberration,'' and O'1R the ''lateral aberration'' of the [[Pencil (physics)|pencils]] with aperture u2. If the pencil with the angle u2 is that of the maximum aberration of all the pencils transmitted, then in a plane perpendicular to the axis at O'1 there is a circular ''disk of confusion'' of radius O'1R, and in a parallel plane at O'2 another one of radius O'2R2; between these two is situated the ''disk of least confusion.''\n\nThe largest opening of the pencils, which take part in the reproduction of O, ''i.e''. the angle u, is generally determined by the margin of one of the lenses or by a hole in a thin plate placed between, before, or behind the lenses of the system.  This hole is termed the ''stop'' or ''diaphragm''; Abbe used the term ''[[aperture]] stop'' for both the hole and the limiting margin of the lens.  The component S1 of the system, situated between the aperture stop and the object O, projects an image of the diaphragm, termed by Abbe the ''entrance pupil''; the ''exit pupil'' is the image formed by the component S2, which is placed behind the aperture stop.  All rays which issue from O and pass through the aperture stop also pass through the entrance and exit pupils, since these are images of the aperture stop.  Since the maximum aperture of the pencils issuing from O is the angle u subtended by the entrance pupil at this point, the magnitude of the aberration will be determined by the position and diameter of the entrance pupil.  If the system be entirely behind the aperture stop, then this is itself the entrance pupil (''front stop''); if entirely in front, it is the exit pupil (''back stop'').\n\nIf the object point be infinitely distant, all rays received by the first member of the system are parallel, and their intersections, after traversing the system, vary according to their ''perpendicular height of incidence,'' i.e. their distance from the axis.  This distance replaces the angle u in the preceding considerations; and the aperture, ''i.e''. the radius of the entrance pupil, is its maximum value.\n\n====Aberration of elements, i.e. smallest objects at right angles to the axis====\nIf rays issuing from O (fig. 1) are concurrent, it does not follow that points in a portion of a plane perpendicular at O to the axis will be also concurrent, even if the part of the plane be very small.  As the diameter of the lens increases (''i.e.'', with increasing aperture_, the neighboring point N will be reproduced, but attended by aberrations comparable in magnitude to ON. These aberrations are avoided if, according to Abbe, the ''sine condition,'' sin u'1/sin u1=sin u'2/sin u2, holds for all rays reproducing the point O. If the object point O is infinitely distant, u1 and u2 are to be replaced by h1 and h2, the perpendicular heights of incidence; the ''sine condition'' then becomes sin u'1/h1=sin u'2/h2. A system fulfilling this condition and free from spherical aberration is called ''aplanatic'' (Greek a-, privative, plann, a wandering).  This word was first used by [[Robert Blair (astronomer)|Robert Blair]] to characterize a superior achromatism, and, subsequently, by many writers to denote freedom from spherical aberration as well.\n\nSince the aberration increases with the distance of the ray from the center of the lens, the aberration increases as the lens diameter increases (or, correspondingly, with the diameter of the aperture), and hence can be minimized by reducing the aperture, at the cost of also reducing the amount of light reaching the image plane.\n\n===Aberration of lateral object points (points beyond the axis) with narrow pencils. Astigmatism.===\n{{main|Astigmatism (optical systems)}}\n{{for |Astigmatism of the eye|Astigmatism}}\n\n[[File:ABERR2.svg|right|frame|Figure 2]]\n\nA point O (fig. 2) at a finite distance from the axis (or with an infinitely distant object, a point which subtends a finite angle at the system) is, in general, even then not sharply reproduced if the pencil of rays issuing from it and traversing the system is made infinitely narrow by reducing the aperture stop; such a pencil consists of the rays which can pass from the object point through the now infinitely small entrance pupil.  It is seen (ignoring exceptional cases) that the pencil does not meet the refracting or reflecting surface at right angles; therefore it is astigmatic (Gr. a-, privative, stigmia, a point).  Naming the central ray passing through the entrance pupil the ''axis of the pencil'' or ''principal ray,'' it can be said: the rays of the pencil intersect, not in one point, but in two focal lines, which can be assumed to be at right angles to the principal ray; of these, one lies in the plane containing the principal ray and the axis of the system, i.e. in the ''first principal section'' or ''meridional section'', and the other at right angles to it, i.e. in the second principal section or sagittal section.  We receive, therefore, in no single intercepting plane behind the system, as, for example, a focusing screen, an image of the object point; on the other hand, in each of two planes lines O' and O\" are separately formed (in neighboring planes ellipses are formed), and in a plane between O' and O\" a circle of least confusion.  The interval O'O\", termed the astigmatic difference, increases, in general, with the angle W made by the principal ray OP with the axis of the system, i.e. with the field of view.  Two ''astigmatic image surfaces'' correspond to one object plane; and these are in contact at the axis point; on the one lie the focal lines of the first kind, on the other those of the second.  Systems in which the two astigmatic surfaces coincide are termed anastigmatic or stigmatic.\n\n[[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] was probably the discoverer of astigmation; the position of the astigmatic image lines was determined by Thomas Young;<ref>Young, Thomas (1807), ''A Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy.''</ref> and the theory was developed by [[Allvar Gullstrand]].<ref>Gullstrand, Allvar (1890) ''Skand. Arch. f. Physiol.''; and (1901) ''Arch. f.  Ophth.'', 53, pp. 2, 185.</ref><ref name=\"gullstrand1900\"/>  A bibliography by P.

Coma.===\nBy opening the stop wider, similar deviations arise for lateral points as have been already discussed for axial points; but in this case they are much more complicated.  The course of the rays in the meridional section is no longer symmetrical to the principal ray of the pencil; and on an intercepting plane there appears, instead of a luminous point, a patch of light, not symmetrical about a point, and often exhibiting a resemblance to a comet having its tail directed towards or away from the axis.  From this appearance it takes its name.  The unsymmetrical form of the meridional pencil\u2014formerly the only one considered\u2014is [[coma (optics)|coma]] in the narrower sense only; other errors of coma have been treated by [[Arthur K\u00f6nig]] and Moritz von Rohr,<ref name=vonRohr/> and later by Allvar Gullstrand.<ref name=\"gullstrand1900\">{{cite journal |first=Allvar |last=Gullstrand |authorlink=Allvar Gullstrand |title=Allgemeine Theorie der monochromat.

In most cases the surface is concave towards the system.\n\n===Distortion of the image===\n[[File:Barrel distortion.svg|thumb|right|Fig. 3a: Barrel distortion]]\n[[File:Pincushion distortion.svg|thumb|right|Fig. 3b: Pincushion distortion]]\n\nEven if the image is sharp, it may be distorted compared to ideal [[pinhole projection]].  In pinhole projection, the magnification of an object is inversely proportional to its distance to the camera along the optical axis so that a camera pointing directly at a flat surface reproduces that flat surface. Distortion can be thought of as stretching the image non-uniformly, or, equivalently, as a variation in magnification across the field. While \"distortion\" can include arbitrary deformation of an image, the most pronounced modes of distortion produced by conventional imaging optics is \"barrel distortion\", in which the center of the image is magnified more than the perimeter (figure 3a). The reverse, in which the perimeter is magnified more than the center, is known as \"pincushion distortion\" (figure 3b). This effect is called lens distortion or [[image distortion]], and there are [http://www.vassg.hu/pdf/vass_gg_2003_lo.pdf algorithms] to correct it.\n\nSystems free of distortion are called ''orthoscopic'' (orthos, right, skopein to look) or ''rectilinear'' (straight lines).\n\n[[File:ABERR3rev.svg|left|frame|Figure 4]]\nThis aberration is quite distinct from that of the sharpness of reproduction; in unsharp, reproduction, the question of distortion arises if only parts of the object can be recognized in the figure.  If, in an unsharp image, a patch of light corresponds to an object point, the ''center of gravity'' of the patch may be regarded as the image point, this being the point where the plane receiving the image, e.g., a focusing screen, intersects the ray passing through the middle of the stop.  This assumption is justified if a poor image on the focusing screen remains stationary when the aperture is diminished; in practice, this generally occurs.  This ray, named by Abbe a ''principal ray'' (not to be confused with the ''principal rays'' of the Gaussian theory), passes through the center of the entrance pupil before the first refraction, and the center of the exit pupil after the last refraction.  From this it follows that correctness of drawing depends solely upon the principal rays; and is independent of the sharpness or curvature of the image field.  Referring to fig. 4, we have O'Q'/OQ = a' tan w'/a tan w = 1/N, where N is the ''scale'' or magnification of the image.  For N to be constant for all values of w, a' tan w'/a tan w must also be constant.  If the ratio a'/a be sufficiently constant, as is often the case, the above relation reduces to the ''condition of [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]],'' i.e. tan w'/ tan w= a constant.  This simple relation (see Camb.  Phil.  Trans., 1830, 3, p.&nbsp;1) is fulfilled in all systems which are symmetrical with respect to their diaphragm (briefly named ''symmetrical or holosymmetrical objectives''), or which consist of two like, but different-sized, components, placed from the diaphragm in the ratio of their size, and presenting the same curvature to it (hemisymmetrical objectives); in these systems tan w' / tan w = 1.\n\nThe constancy of a'/a necessary for this relation to hold was pointed out by R. H. Bow (Brit.  Journ.  Photog., 1861), and Thomas Sutton (Photographic Notes, 1862); it has been treated by O. Lummer and by M. von Rohr (Zeit. f.  Instrumentenk., 1897, 17, and 1898, 18, p.&nbsp;4). It requires the middle of the aperture stop to be reproduced in the centers of the entrance and exit pupils without spherical aberration.  M. von Rohr showed that for systems fulfilling neither the Airy nor the Bow-Sutton condition, the ratio a' cos w'/a tan w will be constant for one distance of the object.  This combined condition is exactly fulfilled by holosymmetrical objectives reproducing with the scale 1, and by hemisymmetrical, if the scale of reproduction be equal to the ratio of the sizes of the two components.\n\n===Zernike model of aberrations===\nCircular wavefront profiles associated with aberrations may be mathematically modeled using [[Zernike polynomial]]s.  Developed by [[Frits Zernike]] in the 1930s, Zernike's polynomials are [[orthogonal]] over a circle of unit radius. A complex, aberrated wavefront profile may be [[curve-fitted]] with Zernike polynomials to yield a set of fitting [[coefficient]]s that individually represent different types of aberrations.  These Zernike coefficients are [[linearly independent]], thus individual aberration contributions to an overall wavefront may be isolated and quantified separately.\n\nThere are [[even and odd functions|even and odd]] Zernike polynomials. The even Zernike polynomials are defined as\n\n:<math>Z^{m}_n(\\rho,\\phi) = R^m_n(\\rho)\\,\\cos(m\\,\\phi) \\!</math>\n\nand the odd Zernike polynomials as\n\n:<math>Z^{-m}_n(\\rho,\\phi) = R^m_n(\\rho)\\,\\sin(m\\,\\phi), \\!</math>\n\nwhere ''m'' and ''n'' are nonnegative [[integer]]s with <math>n\\geq m</math>,  \u03a6 is the [[azimuth]]al [[angle]] in [[radian]]s, and \u03c1 is the normalized radial distance.  The radial polynomials <math>R^m_n</math> have no azimuthal dependence, and are defined as\n\n:<math>R^m_n(\\rho) = \\! \\sum_{k=0}^{(n-m)/2} \\!\\!\\! \\frac{(-1)^k\\,(n-k)!}{k!\\,((n+m)/2-k)!\\,((n-m)/2-k)!} \\;\\rho^{n-2\\,k} \\quad\\mbox{if } n-m \\mbox{ is even}</math>\n\nand <math>R^m_n(\\rho)=0</math> if <math>n-m</math> is odd.\n\nThe first few Zernike polynomials are:\n{|\n|-\n|<math>a_0\\ </math> || \"Piston\", equal to the [[mean value]] of the wavefront\n|-\n|<math>a_1\\times \\rho \\cos(\\theta)</math> || \"X-Tilt\", the deviation of the overall beam in the [[Sagittal ray#Optical systems|sagittal]] direction\n|-\n|<math>a_2\\times \\rho \\sin(\\theta)</math> || \"Y-Tilt\", the deviation of the overall beam in the [[Tangential ray#Optical systems|tangential]] direction\n|-\n|<math>a_3\\times (2\\rho^2-1)</math> || \"Defocus\", a [[Parabola|parabolic]] wavefront resulting from being out of focus\n|-\n|<math>a_4\\times \\rho^2 \\cos(2\\theta)</math> || \"0\u00b0 Astigmatism\", a [[cylindrical]] shape along the X or Y axis\n|-\n|<math>a_5\\times \\rho^2 \\sin(2\\theta)</math> || \"45\u00b0 Astigmatism\", a cylindrical shape oriented at \u00b145\u00b0 from the X axis\n|-\n|<math>a_6\\times (3\\rho^2-2)\\rho \\cos(\\theta)</math> || \"X-Coma\", comatic image flaring in the horizontal direction\n|-\n|<math>a_7\\times (3\\rho^2-2)\\rho \\sin(\\theta)</math> || \"Y-Coma\", comatic image flaring in the vertical direction\n|-\n|<math>a_8\\times (6\\rho^4-6\\rho^2+1)</math> || \"Third order spherical aberration\"\n|}\n\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the normalized pupil radius with <math>0 \\le \\rho \\le 1</math>, <math>\\theta</math> is the azimuthal angle around the pupil with <math>0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi</math>, and the fitting coefficients <math>a_0,\\ldots,a_8</math> are the wavefront errors in wavelengths.\n\nAs in [[Fourier analysis|Fourier]] synthesis using [[sine]]s and [[cosine]]s, a wavefront may be perfectly represented by a sufficiently large number of higher-order Zernike polynomials.  However, wavefronts with very steep [[gradients]] or very high [[spatial frequency]] structure, such as produced by [[Wave propagation|propagation]] through [[atmospheric turbulence]] or [[turbulence|aerodynamic flowfields]], are not well modeled by Zernike polynomials, which tend to [[low-pass filter]] fine [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] definition in the wavefront. In this case, other fitting methods such as [[fractals]] or [[singular value decomposition]] may yield improved fitting results.\n\nThe [[Zernike polynomials|circle polynomials]] were introduced by [[Frits Zernike]] to evaluate the point image of an aberrated optical system taking into account the effects of [[diffraction]]. The perfect point image in the presence of diffraction had already been described by [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]], as early as 1835. It took almost hundred years to arrive at a comprehensive theory and modeling of the point image of aberrated systems (Zernike and Nijboer). The  analysis by Nijboer and Zernike describes the intensity distribution close to the optimum focal plane. An extended theory that allows the calculation of the point image amplitude and  intensity over a much larger volume in the focal region was recently developed ([http://www.nijboerzernike.nl Extended Nijboer-Zernike theory]). This Extended Nijboer-Zernike theory of point image or \u2018point-spread function\u2019 formation has found applications in general research on image formation, especially for systems with a high [[numerical aperture]], and in characterizing optical systems with respect to their aberrations.<ref>{{cite book |title=Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light |first1=Max |last1=Born |first2=Emil |last2=Wolf |isbn=978-0521642224}}</ref>\n\n==Analytic treatment of aberrations==\nThe preceding review of the several errors of reproduction belongs to the ''Abbe theory of aberrations,'' in which definite aberrations are discussed separately; it is well suited to practical needs, for in the construction of an optical instrument certain errors are sought to be eliminated, the selection of which is justified by experience.  In the mathematical sense, however, this selection is arbitrary; the reproduction of a finite object with a finite aperture entails, in all probability, an infinite number of aberrations.  This number is only finite if the object and aperture are assumed to be ''infinitely small of a certain order''; and with each order of infinite smallness, i.e. with each degree of approximation to reality (to finite objects and apertures), a certain number of aberrations is associated.  This connection is only supplied by theories which treat aberrations generally and analytically by means of indefinite series.\n\n[[File:ABERR5rev.svg|right|frame|Figure 5]]\n\nA ray proceeding from an object point O (fig. 5) can be defined by the coordinates (\u03be, \u03b7).  Of this point O in an object plane I, at right angles to the axis, and two other coordinates (x, y), the point in which the ray intersects the entrance pupil, i.e. the plane II. Similarly the corresponding image ray may be defined by the points (\u03be', \u03b7'), and (x', y'), in the planes I' and II'. The origins of these four plane coordinate systems may be collinear with the axis of the optical system; and the corresponding axes may be parallel.  Each of the four coordinates \u03be', \u03b7', x', y' are functions of \u03be, \u03b7, x, y; and if it be assumed that the field of view and the aperture be infinitely small, then \u03be, \u03b7, x, y are of the same order of infinitesimals; consequently by expanding \u03be', \u03b7', x', y' in ascending powers of \u03be, \u03b7, x, y, series are obtained in which it is only necessary to consider the lowest powers.  It is readily seen that if the optical system be symmetrical, the origins of the coordinate systems collinear with the optical axis and the corresponding axes parallel, then by changing the signs of \u03be, \u03b7, x, y, the values \u03be', \u03b7', x', y' must likewise change their sign, but retain their arithmetical values; this means that the series are restricted to odd powers of the unmarked variables.\n\nThe nature of the reproduction consists in the rays proceeding from a point O being united in another point O'; in general, this will not be the case, for \u03be', \u03b7' vary if \u03be, \u03b7 be constant, but x, y variable.  It may be assumed that the planes I' and II' are drawn where the images of the planes I and II are formed by rays near the axis by the ordinary Gaussian rules; and by an extension of these rules, not, however, corresponding to reality, the Gauss image point O'<sub>0</sub>, with coordinates \u03be'<sub>0</sub>, \u03b7'<sub>0</sub>, of the point O at some distance from the axis could be constructed.  Writing D\u03be'=\u03be'-\u03be'<sub>0</sub> and D\u03b7'=\u03b7'-\u03b7'<sub>0</sub>, then D\u03be' and D\u03b7' are the aberrations belonging to \u03be, \u03b7 and x, y, and are functions of these magnitudes which, when expanded in series, contain only odd powers, for the same reasons as given above.  On account of the aberrations of all rays which pass through O, a patch of light, depending in size on the lowest powers of \u03be, \u03b7, x, y which the aberrations contain, will be formed in the plane I'. These degrees, named by [[Jozef Maximili\u00e1n Petzval|J. Petzval]] (''Bericht uber die Ergebnisse einiger dioptrischer Untersuchungen'', Buda Pesth, 1843; ''Akad. Sitzber., Wien,'' 1857, vols. xxiv. xxvi.) ''the numerical orders of the image,'' are consequently only odd powers; the condition for the formation of an image of the mth order is that in the series for D\u03be' and D\u03b7' the coefficients of the powers of the 3rd, 5th\u2026(m-2)th degrees must vanish.  The images of the Gauss theory being of the third order, the next problem is to obtain an image of 5th order, or to make the coefficients of the powers of 3rd degree zero.  This necessitates the satisfying of five equations; in other words, there are five alterations of the 3rd order, the vanishing of which produces an image of the 5th order.\n\nThe expression for these coefficients in terms of the constants of the optical system, i.e. the radii, thicknesses, refractive indices and distances between the lenses, was solved by [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|L. Seidel]] (Astr. Nach., 1856, p.&nbsp;289); in 1840, J. Petzval constructed his portrait objective, from similar calculations which have never been published (see M. von Rohr, ''Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs'', Berlin, 1899, p.&nbsp;248).  The theory was elaborated by S. Finterswalder (Munchen. Acad.  Abhandl., 1891, 17, p.&nbsp;519), who also published a posthumous paper of Seidel containing a short view of his work (''M\u00fcnchen. Akad. Sitzber.,'' 1898, 28, p.&nbsp;395); a simpler form was given by A. Kerber (''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Dioptrik'', Leipzig, 1895-6-7-8-9).  A. Konig and M. von Rohr (see M. von Rohr, ''Die Bilderzeugung in optischen Instrumenten'', pp.&nbsp;317\u2013323) have represented Kerber's method, and have deduced the Seidel formulae from geometrical considerations based on the Abbe method, and have interpreted the analytical results geometrically (pp.&nbsp;212\u2013316).\n\nThe aberrations can also be expressed by means of the ''characteristic function'' of the system and its differential coefficients, instead of by the radii, &c., of the lenses; these formulae are not immediately applicable, but give, however, the relation between the number of aberrations and the order.  Sir William Rowan Hamilton (British Assoc.  Report, 1833, p.&nbsp;360) thus derived the aberrations of the third order; and in later times the method was pursued by Clerk Maxwell (''Proc. London Math. Soc.,'' 1874\u20131875; (see also the treatises of R. S. Heath and L. A. Herman), M. Thiesen (''Berlin. Akad.  Sitzber.,'' 1890, 35, p.&nbsp;804), H. Bruns (''Leipzig. Math. Phys. Ber.,'' 1895, 21, p.&nbsp;410), and particularly successfully by K. Schwarzschild (''G\u00f6ttingen.  Akad.  Abhandl.,'' 1905, 4, No. 1), who thus discovered the aberrations of the 5th order (of which there are nine), and possibly the shortest proof of the practical (Seidel) formulae.  A. Gullstrand (vide supra, and ''Ann. d.  Phys.,'' 1905, 18, p.&nbsp;941) founded his theory of aberrations on the differential geometry of surfaces.\n\nThe aberrations of the third order are: (1) aberration of the axis point; (2) aberration of points whose distance from the axis is very small, less than of the third order \u2014 the deviation from the sine condition and coma here fall together in one class; (3) astigmatism; (4) curvature of the field; (5) distortion.\n\n:'''(1)''' Aberration of the third order of axis points is dealt with in all text-books on optics.  It is very important in telescope design. In telescopes aperture is usually taken as the linear diameter of the objective. It is not the same as microscope aperture which is based on the entrance pupil or field of view as seen from the object and is expressed as an angular measurement. Higher order aberrations in telescope design can be mostly neglected. For microscopes it cannot be neglected. For a single lens of very small thickness and given power, the aberration depends upon the ratio of the radii r:r', and is a minimum (but never zero) for a certain value of this ratio; it varies inversely with the refractive index (the power of the lens remaining constant).  The total aberration of two or more very thin lenses in contact, being the sum of the individual aberrations, can be zero.  This is also possible if the lenses have the same algebraic sign.  Of thin positive lenses with n=1.5, four are necessary to correct spherical aberration of the third order.  These systems, however, are not of great practical importance.  In most cases, two thin lenses are combined, one of which has just so strong a positive aberration (''under-correction,'' vide supra) as the other a negative; the first must be a positive lens and the second a negative lens; the powers, however: may differ, so that the desired effect of the lens is maintained.  It is generally an advantage to secure a great refractive effect by several weaker than by one high-power lens.  By one, and likewise by several, and even by an infinite number of thin lenses in contact, no more than two axis points can be reproduced without aberration of the third order.  Freedom from aberration for two axis points, one of which is infinitely distant, is known as ''Herschel's condition.'' All these rules are valid, inasmuch as the thicknesses and distances of the lenses are not to be taken into account.\n\n:'''(2)''' The condition for freedom from coma in the third order is also of importance for telescope objectives; it is known as ''[[Joseph von Fraunhofer|Fraunhofer's]] condition.'' (4) After eliminating the aberration On the axis, coma and astigmatism, the relation for the flatness of the field in the third order is expressed by the ''Petzval equation,'' S1/r(n'-n) = 0, where r is the radius of a refracting surface, n and n' the refractive indices of the neighboring media, and S the sign of summation for all refracting surfaces.\n\n==Practical elimination of aberrations==\n[[File:The new PARLA laser in operation at ESO\u2019s Paranal Observatory.jpg|thumb|[[Laser guide star]]s assist in the elimination of atmospheric distortion.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Laser Improves VLT\u2019s Capabilities|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann13010/|accessdate=22 February 2013|newspaper=ESO Announcement}}</ref> ]]\n\nThe classical imaging problem is to reproduce perfectly a finite plane (the object) onto another plane (the image) through a finite aperture. It is impossible to do so perfectly for ''more than one'' such pair of planes (this was proven with increasing generality by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] in 1858, by Bruns in 1895, and by [[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory|Carath\u00e9odory]] in 1926, see summary in Walther, A., J. Opt. Soc. Am. A '''6''', 415\u2013422 (1989)). For a single pair of planes (e.g. for a single focus setting of an objective), however, the problem can in principle be solved perfectly. Examples of such a theoretically perfect system include the [[Luneburg lens]] and the [[Maxwell fish-eye]].\n\nPractical methods solve this problem with an accuracy which mostly suffices for the special purpose of each species of instrument.  The problem of finding a system which reproduces a given object upon a given plane with given magnification (insofar as aberrations must be taken into account) could be dealt with by means of the approximation theory; in most cases, however, the analytical difficulties were too great for older calculation methods but may be ameliorated by application of modern computer systems.  Solutions, however, have been obtained in special cases (see A. Konig in M. von Rohr's ''Die Bilderzeugung'', p.&nbsp;373; K. Schwarzschild, G\u00f6ttingen.  Akad. Abhandl., 1905, 4, Nos. 2 and 3). At the present time constructors almost always employ the inverse method: they compose a system from certain, often quite personal experiences, and test, by the trigonometrical calculation of the paths of several rays, whether the system gives the desired reproduction (examples are given in A. Gleichen, ''Lehrbuch der geometrischen Optik'', Leipzig and Berlin, 1902).  The radii, thicknesses and distances are continually altered until the errors of the image become sufficiently small.  By this method only certain errors of reproduction are investigated, especially individual members, or all, of those named above.  The analytical approximation theory is often employed provisionally, since its accuracy does not generally suffice.\n\nIn order to render spherical aberration and the deviation from the sine condition small throughout the whole aperture, there is given to a ray with a finite angle of aperture u* (width infinitely distant objects: with a finite height of incidence h*) the same distance of intersection, and the same sine ratio as to one neighboring the axis (u* or h* may not be much smaller than the largest aperture U or H to be used in the system).  The rays with an angle of aperture smaller than u* would not have the same distance of intersection and the same sine ratio; these deviations are called ''zones,'' and the constructor endeavors to reduce these to a minimum.  The same holds for the errors depending upon the angle of the field of view, w: astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion are eliminated for a definite value, w*, ''zones of astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion,'' attend smaller values of w.  The practical optician names such systems: ''corrected for the angle of aperture u* (the height of incidence h*) or the angle of field of view w*.'' Spherical aberration and changes of the sine ratios are often represented graphically as functions of the aperture, in the same way as the deviations of two astigmatic image surfaces of the image plane of the axis point are represented as functions of the angles of the field of view.\n\nThe final form of a practical system consequently rests on compromise; enlargement of the aperture results in a diminution of the available field of view, and vice versa. But the larger aperture will give the larger resolution. The following may be regarded as typical:\n\n:(1) Largest aperture; necessary corrections are \u2014 for the axis point, and sine condition; errors of the field of view are almost disregarded; example \u2014 high-power microscope objectives.\n\n:(2) [[Wide angle lens]]; necessary corrections are \u2014 for astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion; errors of the aperture only slightly regarded; examples \u2014 photographic widest angle objectives and oculars.\n\n:Between these extreme examples stands the [[normal lens]]: this is corrected more with regard to aperture; objectives for groups more with regard to the field of view.\n\n:(3) [[Long focus lens]]es have small fields of view and aberrations on axis are very important. Therefore zones will be kept as small as possible and design should emphasize simplicity. Because of this these lenses are the best for analytical computation.\n\n==Chromatic or color aberration==\nIn optical systems composed of lenses, the position, magnitude and errors of the image depend upon the refractive indices of the glass employed (see [[Lens (optics)]] and [[#Monochromatic aberration|Monochromatic aberration]], above).  Since the index of refraction varies with the color or wavelength of the light (see [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]), it follows that a system of lenses (uncorrected) projects images of different colors in somewhat different places and sizes and with different aberrations; i.e. there are ''chromatic differences'' of the distances of intersection, of magnifications, and of monochromatic aberrations.  If mixed light be employed (e.g. white light) all these images are formed and they cause a confusion, named chromatic aberration; for instance, instead of a white margin on a dark background, there is perceived a colored margin, or narrow spectrum.  The absence of this error is termed achromatism, and an optical system so corrected is termed achromatic.  A system is said to be ''chromatically under-corrected'' when it shows the same kind of chromatic error as a thin positive lens, otherwise it is said to be ''overcorrected.''\n\nIf, in the first place, monochromatic aberrations be neglected \u2014 in other words, the Gaussian theory be accepted \u2014 then every reproduction is determined by the positions of the focal planes, and the magnitude of the focal lengths, or if the focal lengths, as ordinarily happens, be equal, by three constants of reproduction.  These constants are determined by the data of the system (radii, thicknesses, distances, indices, etc., of the lenses); therefore their dependence on the refractive index, and consequently on the color, are calculable.<ref>Formulae are given in {{cite book |last=Czapski-Eppenstein |title=Grundzuge der Theorie der optischen Instrumente |date=1903 |page=166}}</ref>  The refractive indices for different wavelengths must be known for each kind of glass made use of.  In this manner the conditions are maintained that any one constant of reproduction is equal for two different colors, i.e. this constant is achromatized.  For example, it is possible, with one thick lens in air, to achromatize the position of a focal plane of the magnitude of the focal length.  If all three constants of reproduction be achromatized, then the Gaussian image for all distances of objects is the same for the two colors, and the system is said to be in ''stable achromatism.''\n\nIn practice it is more advantageous (after Abbe) to determine the chromatic aberration (for instance, that of the distance of intersection) for a fixed position of the object, and express it by a sum in which each component conlins the amount due to each refracting surface.<ref>See {{cite book |last=Czapski-Eppenstein |title=Grundzuge der Theorie der optischen Instrumente |date=1903 |page=170}}</ref><ref>A. Konig in M. v. Rohr's collection, ''Die Bilderzeugung'', p. 340</ref>  In a plane containing the image point of one color, another colour produces a disk of confusion; this is similar to the confusion caused by two ''zones'' in spherical aberration.  For infinitely distant objects the radius Of the chromatic disk of confusion is proportional to the linear aperture, and independent of the focal length (''vide supra'', ''Monochromatic Aberration of the Axis Point''); and since this disk becomes the less harmful with an increasing image of a given object, or with increasing focal length, it follows that the deterioration of the image is proportional to the ratio of the aperture to the focal length, i.e. the ''relative aperture.'' (This explains the gigantic focal lengths in vogue before the discovery of achromatism.)\n\nExamples:\n:'''(a)''' In a very thin lens, in air, only one constant of reproduction is to be observed, since the focal length and the distance of the focal point are equal.  If the refractive index for one color be <math>n</math>, and for another <math>n+dn</math>, and the powers, or reciprocals of the focal lengths, be <math>f</math> and <math>f+df</math>, then (1) <math>\\dfrac {df}{f}=\\dfrac {dn}{(n-1)}=\\dfrac{1}{n}</math>; <math>dn</math> is called the dispersion, and <math>n</math> the dispersive power of the glass.\n\n:'''(b)''' Two thin lenses in contact: let <math>f_1</math> and <math>f_2</math> be the powers corresponding to the lenses of refractive indices <math>n_1</math> and <math>n_2</math> and radii <math>r'_1</math>, <math>r''_1</math>, and <math>r'_2</math>, <math>r''_2</math> respectively; let <math>f</math> denote the total power, and <math>df</math>, <math>dn_1</math>, <math>dn_2</math> the changes of <math>f</math>, <math>n_1</math>, and <math>n_2</math> with the color.  Then the following relations hold:\n\n::(2) <math>f=f_1-f_2=(n_1-1)(1/r'_1-1/r''_1)+(n2-1)(1/r'_2-1/r''_2)=(n_1-1)k_1+(n_2-1)k_2</math>; and\n\n::(3) <math>df=k_1dn_1+k_2dn_2</math>.  For achromatism <math>df=0</math>, hence, from (3),\n\n::(4) <math>k_1/k_2=-dn_2/dn_1</math>, or <math>f_1/f_2=-n_1/n_2</math>.  Therefore <math>f_1</math> and <math>f_2</math> must have different algebraic signs, or the system must be composed of a collective and a dispersive lens.  Consequently the powers of the two must be different (in order that <math>f</math> be not zero (equation 2)), and the dispersive powers must also be different (according to 4).\n\nNewton failed to perceive the existence of media of different dispersive powers required by achromatism; consequently he constructed large reflectors instead of refractors.  James Gregory and Leonhard Euler arrived at the correct view from a false conception of the achromatism of the eye; this was determined by Chester More Hall in 1728, Klingenstierna in 1754 and by Dollond in 1757, who constructed the celebrated achromatic telescopes. (See [[telescope]].)\n\nGlass with weaker dispersive power (greater <math>v</math>) is named ''[[Crown glass (optics)|crown glass]]''; that with greater dispersive power, ''[[flint glass]]''. For the construction of an achromatic collective lens (<math>f</math> positive) it follows, by means of equation (4), that a collective lens I. of crown glass and a dispersive lens II. of flint glass must be chosen; the latter, although the weaker, corrects the other chromatically by its greater dispersive power.  For an achromatic dispersive lens the converse must be adopted.  This is, at the present day, the ordinary type, e.g., of telescope objective; the values of the four radii must satisfy the equations (2) and (4). Two other conditions may also be postulated: one is always the elimination of the aberration on the axis; the second either the ''Herschel'' or ''Fraunhofer Condition,'' the latter being the best vide supra, ''Monochromatic Aberration'').  In practice, however, it is often more useful to avoid the second condition by making the lenses have contact, i.e. equal radii.  According to P. Rudolph (Eder's Jahrb. f.  Photog., 1891, 5, p.&nbsp;225; 1893, 7, p.&nbsp;221), cemented objectives of thin lenses permit the elimination of spherical aberration on the axis, if, as above, the collective lens has a smaller refractive index; on the other hand, they permit the elimination of astigmatism and curvature of the field, if the collective lens has a greater refractive index (this follows from the Petzval equation; see L. Seidel, Astr.  Nachr., 1856, p.&nbsp;289).  Should the cemented system be positive, then the more powerful lens must be positive; and, according to (4), to the greater power belongs the weaker dispersive power (greater <math>v</math>), that is to say, crown glass; consequently the crown glass must have the greater refractive index for astigmatic and plane images.  In all earlier kinds of glass, however, the dispersive power increased with the refractive index; that is, <math>v</math> decreased as <math>n</math> increased; but some of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott were crown glasses of high refractive index, and achromatic systems from such crown glasses, with flint glasses of lower refractive index, are called the ''new achromats,'' and were employed by P. Rudolph in the first ''anastigmats'' (photographic objectives).\n\nInstead of making <math>df</math> vanish, a certain value can be assigned to it which will produce, by the addition of the two lenses, any desired chromatic deviation, e.g. sufficient to eliminate one present in other parts of the system.  If the lenses I. and II. be cemented and have the same refractive index for one color, then its effect for that one color is that of a lens of one piece; by such decomposition of a lens it can be made chromatic or achromatic at will, without altering its spherical effect.  If its chromatic effect (<math>df/f</math>) be greater than that of the same lens, this being made of the more dispersive of the two glasses employed, it is termed ''hyper-chromatic.''\n\nFor two thin lenses separated by a distance <math>D</math> the condition for achromatism is <math>D=v_1f_1+v_2f_2</math>; if <math>v_1=v_2</math> (e.g. if the lenses be made of the same glass), this reduces to <math>D=(f_1+f_2)/2</math>, known as the ''condition for oculars.''\n\nIf a constant of reproduction, for instance the focal length, be made equal for two colors, then it is not the same for other colors, if two different glasses are employed.  For example, the condition for achromatism (4) for two thin lenses in contact is fulfilled in only one part of the spectrum, since <math>dn_2/dn_1</math> varies within the spectrum.  This fact was first ascertained by J. Fraunhofer, who defined the colors by means of the dark lines in the solar spectrum; and showed that the ratio of the dispersion of two glasses varied about 20% from the red to the violet (the variation for glass and water is about 50%).  If, therefore, for two colors, a and b, <math>f_a=f_b=f</math>, then for a third color, c, the focal length is different; that is, if c lies between a and b, then <math>f_c<f</math>, and vice versa; these algebraic results follow from the fact that towards the red the dispersion of the positive crown glass preponderates, towards the violet that of the negative flint.  These chromatic errors of systems, which are achromatic for two colors, are called the ''secondary spectrum,'' and depend upon the aperture and focal length in the same manner as the primary chromatic errors do.\n\nIn fig. 6, taken from M. von Rohr's ''Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs'', the abscissae are focal lengths, and the ordinates wavelengths. The [[Fraunhofer line]]s used are shown in adjacent table.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n| A' || C || D || Green [[Mercury (element)|Hg]]. || F || G' || Violet Hg.\n|-\n| 767.7 || 656.3|| 589.3 || 546.1 || 486.2 || 454.1 || 405.1&nbsp;nm\n|}\n[[File:ABERR6rev.png|right|frame|Figure 6]]\n\nThe focal lengths are made equal for the lines C and F. In the neighborhood of 550&nbsp;nm the tangent to the curve is parallel to the axis of wavelengths; and the focal length varies least over a fairly large range of color, therefore in this neighborhood the color union is at its best.  Moreover, this region of the spectrum is that which appears brightest to the human eye, and consequently this curve of the secondary on spectrum, obtained by making <math>f_C=f_F</math>, is, according to the experiments of Sir G. G. Stokes (Proc.  Roy. Soc., 1878), the most suitable for visual instruments (''optical achromatism,'').  In a similar manner, for systems used in photography, the vertex of the color curve must be placed in the position of the maximum sensibility of the plates; this is generally supposed to be at G'; and to accomplish this the F and violet mercury lines are united.  This artifice is specially adopted in objectives for astronomical photography (''pure actinic achromatism'').  For ordinary photography, however, there is this disadvantage: the image on the focusing-screen and the correct adjustment of the photographic sensitive plate are not in register; in astronomical photography this difference is constant, but in other kinds it depends on the distance of the objects.  On this account the lines D and G' are united for ordinary photographic objectives; the optical as well as the actinic image is chromatically inferior, but both lie in the same place; and consequently the best correction lies in F (this is known as the ''actinic correction'' or ''freedom from chemical focus'').\n\nShould there be in two lenses in contact the same focal lengths for three colours a, b, and c, i.e. <math>f_a=f_b=f_c=f</math>, then the relative partial dispersion <math>(n_c-n_b)(n_a-n_b)</math> must be equal for the two kinds of glass employed.  This follows by considering equation (4) for the two pairs of colors ac and bc. Until recently no glasses were known with a proportional degree of absorption; but R. Blair (Trans. Edin. Soc., 1791, 3, p.&nbsp;3), P. Barlow, and F. S. Archer overcame the difficulty by constructing fluid lenses between glass walls.  Fraunhofer prepared glasses which reduced the secondary spectrum; but permanent success was only assured on the introduction of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott.  In using glasses not having proportional dispersion, the deviation of a third colour can be eliminated by two lenses, if an interval be allowed between them; or by three lenses in contact, which may not all consist of the old glasses.  In uniting three colors an ''achromatism of a higher order'' is derived; there is yet a residual ''tertiary spectrum,'' but it can always be neglected.\n\nThe Gaussian theory is only an approximation; monochromatic or spherical aberrations still occur, which will be different for different colors; and should they be compensated for one color, the image of another color would prove disturbing.  The most important is the chromatic difference of aberration of the axis point, which is still present to disturb the image, after par-axial rays of different colors are united by an appropriate combination of glasses.  If a collective system be corrected for the axis point for a definite wavelength, then, on account of the greater dispersion in the negative components \u2014 the flint glasses, \u2014 overcorrection will arise for the shorter wavelengths (this being the error of the negative components), and under-correction for the longer wavelengths (the error of crown glass lenses preponderating in the red).  This error was treated by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and, in special detail, by C. F. Gauss.  It increases rapidly with the aperture, and is more important with medium apertures than the secondary spectrum of par-axial rays; consequently, spherical aberration must be eliminated for two colors, and if this be impossible, then it must be eliminated for those particular wavelengths which are most effectual for the instrument in question (a graphical representation of this error is given in M. von Rohr, ''Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs'').\n\nThe condition for the reproduction of a surface element in the place of a sharply reproduced point \u2014 the constant of the sine relationship must also be fulfilled with large apertures for several colors.  E. Abbe succeeded in computing microscope objectives free from error of the axis point and satisfying the sine condition for several colors, which therefore, according to his definition, were ''aplanatic for several colors''; such systems he termed ''[[apochromatic]]''.  While, however, the magnification of the individual zones is the same, it is not the same for red as for blue; and there is a chromatic difference of magnification.  This is produced in the same amount, but in the opposite sense, by the oculars, which Abbe used with these objectives (''compensating oculars''), so that it is eliminated in the image of the whole microscope.  The best telescope objectives, and photographic objectives intended for three-color work, are also apochromatic, even if they do not possess quite the same quality of correction as microscope objectives do.  The chromatic differences of other errors of reproduction have seldom practical importances.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wavefront coding]]\n* [[Aberrations of the eye]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Aberration|volume=1|pages=54-61}} Authorities cited:\n** H.

She recorded a demo tape for her parents with church youth-leader [[Brown Bannister]]. When Bannister was dubbing a copy of the tape, [[Chris Christian]], the owner of the recording studio, heard the demo and called [[Word Records]]. He played it over the phone, and she was offered a recording contract, five weeks before her 16th birthday. In 1977, she recorded her first album, ''[[Amy Grant (album)|Amy Grant]]'', produced by Brown Bannister, who would also produce her next 11 albums. It was released in early 1978, one month before her high-school graduation. Toward the end of 1978 she performed her first ticketed concert after beginning her first year at [[Furman University]]. In May 1979, while at the album-release party for her second album, ''[[My Father's Eyes (album)|My Father's Eyes]]'', Grant met [[Gary Chapman (musician)|Gary Chapman]], who had written the title track and would become her first husband.  Grant and Chapman toured together in mid-1979. In late 1980, she transferred to [[Vanderbilt University]], where she was a member of the sorority [[Kappa Alpha Theta]].<ref name=\"Mosaic\"/> Grant then made a few more albums before dropping out of college to pursue a career in music\u2014''[[Never Alone (Amy Grant album)|Never Alone]]'', followed by a pair of live albums in 1981 (''[[In Concert (Amy Grant album)|In Concert]]'' and ''[[In Concert Volume Two (Amy Grant album)|In Concert Volume Two]]''), both backed by an augmented edition of the [[DeGarmo and Key|DeGarmo & Key]] band. It was during these early shows that Grant also established one of her concert trademarks: performing barefoot.

Grant received her first [[Grammy Award]] for Best Contemporary Gospel Performance, as well as two [[GMA Dove Awards]] for Gospel Artist of the Year and Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year. ''Age to Age'' became the first Christian album by a solo artist to be certified gold (1983) and the first Christian album to be certified platinum (1985).<ref name=\"cnn\"/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Grant began touring and recording with young up-and-coming songwriter [[Michael W.

Aberdeen is the principal city of the Aberdeen Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Brown and [[Edmunds County, South Dakota|Edmunds]] counties and has a population of 40,602 in 2010. Aberdeen is considered a [[college town]], being the home of both [[Northern State University]] and [[Presentation College, South Dakota|Presentation College]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Settlement===\nBefore Aberdeen or Brown County was inhabited by European settlers, it was inhabited by the [[Lakota people|Sioux Indians]] from approximately 1700 to 1879. Europeans entered the region for business, founding [[fur trading]] posts during the 1820s; these trading posts operated until the mid-1830s. The first \"settlers\" of this region were the [[Arikara|Arikara Indians]], but they would later be joined by others.\n\nThe first group of Euro-American settlers to reach the area that is now Brown County was a party of four people, three horses, two mules, fifteen cattle, and two wagons. This group of settlers was later joined by another group the following spring, and, eventually, more settlers migrated toward this general area, currently known as [[Columbia, South Dakota]]. This town was established on June 15, 1879. The town was settled in 1880,<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |title=Aberdeen |edition=15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=28}}</ref> and incorporated in 1882.\n\n===Creation of the town===\n[[File:Aberdeen 1883.jpg|thumb|right|1883 illustration of Aberdeen]]\nAberdeen, like many towns of the Midwest, was built around the newly developing railroad systems. Aberdeen was first officially plotted as a town site on January 3, 1881, by Charles Prior, the superintendent of the Minneapolis office of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad]], or the Milwaukee Road for short, which was presided over by [[Alexander Mitchell (Wisconsin politician)|Alexander Mitchell]]. Mitchell, Charles Prior's boss, was responsible for the choice of town names, was born in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland, after which the town of Aberdeen, South Dakota, was named.<ref name=EB/> Aberdeen was officially founded on July 6, 1881, the date of the first arrival of a Milwaukee Railroad train. Aberdeen then operated under a city charter granted by the Territorial Legislature in March 1883.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAs Aberdeen grew, many businesses and buildings were constructed along Aberdeen's Main Street. However, this soon became a problem due to Aberdeen's periodic flooding, which led to it being referred to as \"The Town in the Frog Pond\". At first, this unique condition presented no problem to the newly constructed buildings because it had not rained very much but, when heavy rains fell, the Pond reappeared and flooded the basements of every building on Main Street, causing many business owners and home owners much turmoil. When this flooding happened, the city had one steam-powered pump that had to be used to dry out the entire area that had been flooded, which would take days, if not weeks \u2013 and more often than not, it would have rained again in this time period and caused even more flooding, even in the basements that had already been emptied of the water. When the water was gone from the basements, the city still had to deal with the mud that also resulted from the heavy rains.\n\nThe city decided in 1882 to build an artesian ditch to control the \"Frog Pond\" effects; the plan was later upgraded and developed into an artesian well in 1884 to combat the heavy rains and keep the basements from flooding. The artesian well was designed by the city engineers to prevent flooding and develop a water system. However, during the digging of the well, the water stream that was found underground was too powerful to be contained. The water came blasting out with violent force and had the entire Main Street submerged in up to four feet of water. The engineers realized the previous flaws of the artesian well plan and soon added a gate valve to the well to control the flow of water, giving Aberdeen its first working water supply.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nAberdeen had four different railroad companies with depots built in the newly developing town. With these four railroads intersecting here, Aberdeen soon became known as the \"Hub City of the Dakotas\". When looking down on Aberdeen from above, the railroad tracks converging in Aberdeen resembled the spokes of a wheel converging at a hub, hence the name \"Hub City of the Dakotas\". These four railroad companies are the reason why Aberdeen was able to grow and flourish as it did. The only railroad still running through Aberdeen is the Burlington Northern Santa Fe.\n\n[[File:Aberdeen, South Dakota 1910.jpg|thumb|right|Labeled photograph of downtown Aberdeen, 1910.]]\n\n===1999 South Dakota Learjet Crash===\nOn October 25, 1999, a Learjet 35 carrying golfing star [[Payne Stewart]] crashed in a field near Mina, 10 miles west of Aberdeen.

Their area of responsibility includes northern and eastern South Dakota and two counties in west-central Minnesota.\n\nAberdeen is the county seat of Brown County. The original county seat was, however, [[Columbia, South Dakota|Columbia]]. During the days of the railroad construction, plans were laid to bring the railroad through Columbia, then the county seat. When word of this spread, land in and around Columbia soared in price due to speculation. When the time came for the railroads to purchase land, the increase in land prices led them to change their decision and instead to route the rail lines through Aberdeen. However, once Aberdeen became a town in 1881, there was a long-running controversy concerning which town would be the county seat, which continued until 1890, when it was declared by the newly formed South Dakota state constitution in 1889 that a majority vote could move the county seat if the county seat in question had originally been established by less than a majority vote. The result of the vote declared that Aberdeen would be the county seat once and for all, so all of the records were once again transferred to Aberdeen's courthouse; during the battle for county seat, the records had been moved from Columbia's courthouse to Aberdeen's courthouse (which was built from 1886 to 1887), and back again to Columbia's in what seemed to be a never-ending cycle of the transferring of records.

It is on the north shore of the [[Firth of Forth]], looking south to the island of [[Inchcolm]] and its Abbey, and to [[Leith]] and [[Edinburgh]] beyond. According to the 2011 census, the village has a population of 1,633.<ref name=\"Scotland's Census 2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ods-web/area.html|title=Scotland's Census 2011- Aberdour Locality 2010 Profile |publisher=www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk|year=2011 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe village's winding High Street lies a little inland from the coast. Narrow lanes run off it, providing access to the more hidden parts of the village and the shoreline itself. The village nestles between the bigger coastal towns of [[Burntisland]] to the east and [[Dalgety Bay]] to the west.\n\nThe [[Civil parishes in Scotland|parish]] of Aberdour takes its name from this village, and had a population of 1,972 at the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]].<ref name= KS101SC_1>Census of Scotland 2011, Table KS101SC \u2013 Usual Resident Population, published by National Records of Scotland.

See \u201cStandard Outputs\u201d, Table KS101SC, Area type: Civil Parish 1930, Area: Aberdour</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origins of the village lie with its harbour, where the Dour Burn enters the River Forth. The place-name itself is [[Pictish language|Pictish]], implying an origin in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]: ''aber'' 'confluence'. The -dour element, referring to the Burn, means simply 'water' (archaic ''dobur''), and is unconnected to the Scots/English 'dour'. For much of its history Aberdour was two villages, '''Wester Aberdour''' and '''Easter Aberdour''', on either side of the Dour Burn; however this distinction was blurred by the 19th century arrival of the railway.\n\nIn the 18th century Aberdour's harbour was improved by the addition of a stone pier to help handle the coal traffic from nearby collieries. However, in the 1850s the traffic changed dramatically, and Aberdour Harbour became a popular destination for pleasure steamers from [[Leith]]. This in turn led to the building of a deeper water pier a little around the bay at Hawkcraig, and to the development of hotels and many of the other services still on view today in the village.[[File:Aberdour railway station garden.jpg|thumb|[[Aberdour railway station]]|alt=|left]]\n\nThe railway came to Aberdour in 1890, with the building of the line east from the newly opened [[Forth Bridge]]. The [[Aberdour railway station|station]] has won many \"best kept station\" awards.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} The half an hour journey to the centre of [[Edinburgh]] helped build on the existing popularity of the village, though it put the steamers out of business. The main result was a growth in the building of large and attractive houses, especially down the hill from Wester Aberdour to the West Sands. [[Ticket inspector]]s on the train line through Aberdour were known for their sing song refrain: ''\"Half an hour, Half an hour, Half an hour to Aberdour \u2014 tickets please.\"''{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n== Landmarks ==\n[[Image:Aberdour Castle from dovecote.jpg|left|thumb|[[Aberdour Castle]]]]\n\nVirtually between the two former settlements, though actually part of Easter Aberdour, lies [[Aberdour Castle]]. This started life as a modest [[hall house]] on a site overlooking the Dour Burn in the 13th century. The oldest part of the present semi-ruin constitutes one of the earliest surviving stone castles in mainland [[Scotland]]. Over the next four hundred years the Castle was successively developed according to contemporary architectural ideas. Notable are the parts, still largely roofed, built by the Earls of Morton, with refined [[Renaissance]] detail, in the second half of the 16th century. A fire in the late 17th century was followed by some repairs, but in 1725 the family purchased 17th century Aberdour House, on the west side of the burn and in Wester Aberdour, and the medieval Castle was allowed to fall into relative decay. Aberdour Castle is now in the care of [[Historic Scotland]] and open to the public (entrance charge). After a period of dereliction Aberdour House was developed for residential use in the early 1990s.\n\n[[Image:St Fillans Church -Aberdour -Scotland2.jpg|right|thumb|St Fillan's Church]]\n\nNeighbouring St Fillan's Church is one of the best-preserved medieval parish churches in [[Scotland]], dating largely to the 12th century. A south arcade was added to the nave in the early 16th century (open in summer). The [[A921 road|A921]], the main road along the south coast of [[Fife]], leads down the High Street of Wester Aberdour, before kinking sharply left to cross the railway line, then right again to progress through Easter Aberdour's Main Street.\n\nWester Aberdour has the more 'olde worlde' feel of the two, with the narrower through road more closely hemmed in by shops and hotels. A number of vernacular buildings of the 17th-early 19th centuries add to the historic scene. Close to the railway bridge, three lanes continue eastwards, presumably once the route of the original High Street before the arrival of the railway. One now leads to [[Aberdour railway station]], a beautifully kept and cared for example of a traditional station, in keeping with its role of transporting at least a quarter of the village's working population to their work each day.\n\nA second lane leads alongside the railway line to [[Aberdour Castle]], while a third leads to the restored Aberdour House. A little further west, a narrow road closely lined with high walls, Shore Road, leads down to the West Sands and the Harbour. For many this area is the highlight of any visit to Aberdour; parking at the foot of Shore Road is usually at a premium.\n\nAnother road leads coastwards from Easter Aberdour. Hawkcraig Road leads past St Fillan's Church and through Silversand Park, home to [[Aberdour Shinty Club]], en route to the much better parking area on Hawkcraig. This was formerly a sandstone quarry and then used as the council refuse tip before becoming a carpark, part of the overgrown and rocky bluff separating Aberdour's two bays. From here is it a short walk to the Silver Sands, Aberdour's busiest and most popular beach. On the west side of Hawkcraig Point there is a short concrete jetty that was used as part of the development of radio controlled torpedoes during World War One. The foundations of the Radio Hut can still be seen in the lea of the hill.\n\nThe Aberdour obelisk was built by [[James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton|Lord Morton]] on his departure from the village to relocate to a large home in Edinburgh, it was built so he could see his former hometown from his new house when he looked through binoculars - it stands in a cowfield between the castle and the beach.\n\n== Culture ==\n\nAberdour hosts an annual festival, which runs from late July to early August and features musical events, shows, sporting events and children's events.<ref>{{cite web|author=Craig Robertson |url=http://www.aberdour-festival.org |title=Aberdour festival |publisher=Aberdour festival |date= |accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref>\n\nAberdour was a 2005 finalist in the prestigious \"Beautiful Scotland in Bloom\" awards. It was nominated for \"''Best Coastal Resort''\" in [[Scotland]] along with [[St Andrews]] in [[Fife]], [[North Berwick]] in [[East Lothian]], and [[Rothesay, Argyll and Bute|Rothesay]] in [[Argyll and Bute]].\nIn 2014 Aberdour was voted Best Coastal Village in Fife and Best Small Coastal Village in Scotland. It also received a Gold Award in Beautiful Fife and Beautiful Scotland. In 2018 Aberdour was voted the second-best place to live in Scotland by The Sunday Times list of Best Places to Live<ref>https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/aberdour-fife-best-places-to-live-qg32sckfh</ref>\n\nAberdour is home to Fife's only senior shinty club. [[Aberdour Shinty Club]] field teams in both the men's and women's senior national leagues.\n\n== Aberdour's beaches ==\n[[File:Silversands Bay from the air (geograph 5835067).jpg|thumb|right|Silversands Bay from the air]]\nAberdour has two beaches - the Silver Sands, and the Black Sands.\n\nThe Silver Sands<ref>[http://ukbeaches.guide/beach-guide/beach.php?beach=456 Silver Sands Beach]</ref> are located on the East side of the village, and has previously held a \"[[Blue Flag beach|Blue flag]]\" beach award, which denotes an exemplary standard of cleanliness, facilities, safety, environmental education and management. New facilities are currently under construction by Fife Council, which will much improve the beach throughout the year.\n\nThe Black Sands (also known as the West Beach), as the contrasting name would suggest, have a rockier and darker sand, and are also popular with visitors exploring the rock caves and fascinating sea life. During the summer months (April\u2013September), dogs are banned from the Silver Sands but they are allowed all year round at the West Beach. The two beaches are linked by part of the [[Fife Coastal Path]] which also takes you past the harbour and the Hawkcraig - a popular rock climbing location.<ref>[http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/listArea.php?AreaID=7544 Rock Climbing Routes: Europe/Scotland/Central Lowlands/The Hawkcraig] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041221114813/http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/listArea.php?AreaID=7544 |date=December 21, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nSilver Sands is becoming more popular with open water swimmers, who swim daily in the sea, both as a leisure pursuit, and as training for open water competition. The bay provides safety from the currents, although only the adventurous swim round to the harbour.\n\nSeveral scenes of [[Richard Jobson (television presenter)|Richard Jobson]]'s 2003 movie \"[[16 Years of Alcohol]]\" were filmed at the Black Sands in Aberdour.\n\n== Inchcolm ==\n{{Main|Inchcolm}}\n\nThe island of [[Inchcolm]], or Island ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] ''innis'') of [[Columba]], a quarter of a mile from the shore, forms part of the parish of Aberdour. Its name implies associations dating back to the time of [[Columba]] and, although undocumented before the 12th century, it may have served the monks of the Columban family as an '[[Iona]] of the east' from early times.\n\nDuring the First and Second World Wars, [[Inchcolm]] was occupied by the army as part of the defences of the [[Firth of Forth]]. There are extensive remains of gun emplacements, barracks, etc. from these periods.\n\nThe island is notable for its wildlife, especially seabirds and seals.

Since 1885, when the [[Duke of Montrose]] constructed a road over the eastern shoulder of Craigmore to join the older road at the entrance of the [[Trossachs]] pass, Aberfoyle has become the alternative route to the Trossachs and [[Loch Katrine]]; this road, known as the Duke's Road or [[Duke's Pass]], was opened to the public in 1931 when the [[Forestry Commission]] acquired the land.\n\n[[Loch Ard]], about {{convert|2|mi|km|0|spell=in}} west of Aberfoyle, lies 40 metres above the sea. It is {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} long (including the narrows at the east end) and one mile (1\u00bd&nbsp;km) broad. Towards the west end is Eilean Gorm (''the green isle''), and near the north-western shore are the falls of Ledard. The loch's northern shores are dominated by the mountain ridge of [[Beinn an Fhogharaidh]] (616 m). Two miles northwest of Loch Ard is Loch Chon, at 90m above the sea, {{convert|1+1/4|mi|km|abbr=off}} long, and about half a mile broad. It drains by the Avon Dhu to Loch Ard, which is drained in turn by the Forth.\n\n== Toponym ==\nAberfoyle supposedly originates from the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], ''aber poll'' or ''aber phuill'' ([[Scottish Gaelic]], <em lang=\"gd\">Obar Phuill</em>), meaning (place at the) mouth of the Phuill Burn (the Pow Burn enters the River Forth at Aberfoyle). Historically, alternative spellings such as ''Abirfull'', ''Aberfule'', ''Aberfoill'' and ''Aberfoil'' have been recorded before the current spelling became accepted by the 20th century.<ref>{{cite thesis | type=PhD | last=McNiven | first=Peter E. | date=2011 | title=Gaelic place-names and the social history of Gaelic speakers in Medieval Menteith | publisher=University of Glasgow | url=http://theses.gla.ac.uk/2685/1/2011mcnivenphd.pdf}}</ref>\n[[File:Milepost on A81 - geograph.org.uk - 988577.jpg|thumbnail|An old milepost near Craigmaddie House.

Other industries included an ironworks, established in the 1720s, as well as wool spinning and a lint mill.\n\nFrom 1882 the village was served by [[Aberfoyle railway station]], the terminus of the [[Strathendrick and Aberfoyle Railway]] which connected to Glasgow via [[Dumbarton]] or [[Kirkintilloch]]. The station closed to passenger traffic in 1951, and the remaining freight services ceased in 1959.\n\nThe above industries have since died out, and Aberfoyle is supported mainly by the forestry, industry and tourism.<ref>[http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/aberfoyle/aberfoyle/index.html Aberfoyle Feature Page on Undiscovered Scotland]</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\nVisitors were first attracted to Aberfoyle and the surrounding area after the publication of ''[[Lady of the Lake|The Lady of the Lake]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]] in 1810. The poem described the beauty of [[Loch Katrine]]. Aberfoyle describes itself as ''The Gateway to the Trossachs'', and is well situated for visitors to access attractions such as [[Loch Lomond]] and [[Inchmahome Priory]] at the [[Lake of Menteith]]. A tourist information office run by [[VisitScotland]] sits in the centre of town, offering free information, selling souvenirs and acting as a booking office for many of the local B&B's and hotels. Aberfoyle Golf Club was built in 1860 and is located just south of town near the Rob Roy restaurant. Aberfoyle is also part of the [[Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park]].<ref>[http://www.perthshire-scotland.co.uk/aberfoyle2.htm About Aberfoyle]</ref>\n\nAberfoyle is also home to the largest [[Go Ape]] adventure course in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], featuring the longest [[zip-line|death slide, or 'zip-line',]] in the UK.\n\n==Historical figures==\n[[File:The Old Kirk Graveyard in Aberfoyle.jpg|alt=Visit the grave of the Rev Robert Kirk at the The Old Kirk in Aberfoyle |thumb|220x220px|Visit the grave of the Rev Robert Kirk at the Old Kirk in Aberfoyle ]]\nAberfoyle has connections to many historical figures such as [[Robert Roy MacGregor|Rob Roy]] and [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Robert Roy MacGregor was born at the head of nearby Loch Katrine, and his well-known cattle stealing exploits took him all around the area surrounding Aberfoyle. It is recorded, for example, that in 1691, the MacGregors raided every barn in the village of Kippen and stole all the villagers' livestock!<ref>{{cite book|last=Hood|first=John|title=Old Aberfoyle, Thornhill and the Forth Villages|year=2000|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Catrine, Ayrshire|isbn=9781840331103|page=3|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref=129}}</ref> There currently stands a tree in the village that MacGregor was reputed to have climbed and hid in to escape the clutches of the law. Also, Mary, Queen of Scots, visited nearby Inchmahome Priory often as a child, and during her short reign. She also used the priory during her short reign, particularly in 1547, where she felt safe from the English Army.\n\nHowever, the most local historical figure is the Reverend [[Robert Kirk (folklorist)|Robert Kirk]], born in 1644. It was the Rev. Kirk who provided the first translation into [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaidhlig]] of the Book of Psalms,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/parishes/parhistory617.html|title=Parish of Aberfoyle|publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland|accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref> however, he is better remembered for the publication of his book ''\"The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies\"'' in 1691.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kirk|first=Robert|title=The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies|publisher=New York Review of Books Classics|date=30 November 2006|edition=hardcover|isbn=1-59017-177-2|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1590171772|accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/sce/|title=The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies|last=Hare|first=John Bruno|date=27 February 2004|accessdate=14 August 2009}} '''Full text of 1893 book'''</ref> Kirk had long been researching fairies, and the book collected several personal accounts and stories of folk who claimed to have encountered them. It was after this, while Kirk was minister of Aberfoyle parish, that he died in unusual circumstances.\n\nKirk had long believed that the local Doon Hill was the gateway to the \"Secret Commonwealth\", or the land of the Fairies. It was a place that Kirk visited often, taking daily walks there from his manse. The story goes that the Fairies of Doon Hill were angry with the Rev. Kirk for going into the domain of the Unseelie court, where he had been warned not to go, and decided to imprison him in Doon Hill&nbsp;\u2014 for one night in May 1692, the Rev. Kirk went out for a walk to the hill, in his nightshirt. Some accounts claim that he simply vanished, however he suddenly collapsed. He was found and brought home, but died soon afterwards. He was buried in his own kirkyard, although local legends claim that the fairies took his body away, and the coffin contains only stones. The huge pine tree that still stands at the top of Doon Hill is said to contain Kirk's imprisoned spirit.\n\nKirk's cousin, Graham of Duchray, was then to claim that the spectre of Kirk had visited him in the night, and told him that he had been carried off by the Fairies. Having left his widow expecting a child, the spectre of Kirk told Graham that he would appear at the baptism, whereupon Graham was to throw an iron knife at the apparition, thus freeing Kirk from the Fairies' clutches. However, when Kirk's spectre appeared, Graham was apparently too shocked by the vision to throw the knife, and Kirk's ghost faded away forever.\n\nToday, visitors to Doon Hill write their wishes on pieces of white silk, or other white cloth, and tie them to the branches of the trees for the Fairies to grant. Unfortunately some people tie plastic confectionery wrappers instead, which slightly spoils the magic of the location and may harm the ecology of the forest. It is also said that if one runs around the great 'Minister's Pine' tree at the summit seven times, then the Fairies will appear. Some people have tried this and afterwards claim to have seen apparitions. Others merely get a bit dizzy and fall over.\n\n==Use in fiction==\n*Aberfoyle was used as the location and [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]] for the adventure novel \"[[The Child of the Cavern|Les Indes noires]]\" (English title: The Child of the Cavern) by [[Jules Verne]].\n*The \"Clachan of Aberfoil\", then (in 1715) a small hamlet, plays a significant role in the second Volume of the novel [[Rob Roy (novel)|Rob Roy]] by [[Walter Scott]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of places in Stirling (district)]]\n*[http://www.trossachs.co.uk/aberfoyle.php Read more about Aberfoyle and its history]\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Aberfoyle, Stirling}}\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Aberfoyle}}\n\n{{Stirling Towns & Villages}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Stirling (council area)]]\n[[Category:Trossachs]]", "sha1": "2ukw1i4o2cqk0oneh1n3dolrz2jsmbu"}}, {"title": "Abergavenny", "ns": "0", "id": "2715", "revision": {"id": "863992923", "parentid": "861830109", "timestamp": "2018-10-14T11:46:55Z", "contributor": {"ip": "82.0.161.78"}, "comment": "/* 19th and 20th centuries */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Y Fenni|the type of cheese|Y Fenni cheese}}\n{{More footnotes|date=December 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n| coordinates                 = {{coord|51.824|-3.0167|display=inline,title}}\n| country                     = Wales\n| official_name               = Abergavenny\n| welsh_name                  = Y Fenni\n| community_wales             = Abergavenny\n| unitary_wales               = [[Monmouthshire]]\n| lieutenancy_wales           = [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]]\n| constituency_westminster    = [[Monmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth]]\n| constituency_welsh_assembly = [[Monmouth (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Monmouth]]\n| post_town                   = ABERGAVENNY\n| postcode_area               = NP\n| postcode_district           = NP7\n| dial_code                   = 01873\n| os_grid_reference           = SO295145\n| population                  = 12515\n| population_ref              = (2011){{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n| static_image_name           = Abergavenny.jpg\n| static_image_caption        = The Market Hall and Town Hall clock tower\n| london_distance             = \n| cardiff_distance            = \n}}\n'''Abergavenny''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u00e6|b|\u0259r|\u0261|\u0259|\u02c8|v|\u025b|n|i}}; {{lang-cy|Y Fenni}} {{IPA-cy|\u0259 \u02c8v\u025bn\u026a|pron}}, archaically ''Abergafenni'' meaning \"Mouth of the [[River Gavenny]]\") is a [[market town]] and [[Community (Wales)|community]] in [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]].

The river later became, in Welsh, ''Gafenni'', and the town's name became ''Abergafenni'', meaning \"mouth of (Welsh: ''Aber'') the Gavenny (''Gafenni'')\".  In Welsh, the shortened form ''Y Fenni'' may have come into use after about the 15th century, and is now used as the Welsh name.

In law, the term abeyance can only be applied to such [[Future interest|future estates]] as have not yet vested or possibly may not vest.  For example, an estate is granted to A for life, with [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] to the heir of B.  During B's lifetime, the remainder is in abeyance, for until the death of A it is uncertain who is B's heir.  Similarly the [[Freehold (real property)|freehold]] of a [[benefice]], on the death of the incumbent, is said to be in abeyance until the next incumbent takes possession.<ref Name=\"Chisholm\">{{EB1911|wstitle=Abeyance|volume=1|page=61|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nThe term '''hold in abeyance''' is used in lawsuits and court cases when a case is temporarily put on hold.\n\n==English peerage law==\n===History===\nThe most common use of the term is in the case of English [[British Peerage|peerage]] dignities.  Most such peerages pass to [[Order of succession#Agnatic succession|heirs-male]], but the ancient [[barony|baronies]] created by [[hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writ]], as well as some very old [[earldom]]s, pass instead to [[Order of succession#Primogeniture|heirs-general]] (by [[cognatic primogeniture]]). In this system, sons are preferred from eldest to youngest, the heirs of a son over the next son, and any son over daughters, but there is no preference among daughters: they or their heirs inherit equally.\n\nIf the daughter is an only child or her sisters are deceased and have no living issue, she (or her heir) is vested with the title; otherwise, since a peerage cannot be shared nor divided, the dignity goes into abeyance between the sisters or their heirs, and is held by no one. If through lack of issue, marriage, or both, eventually only one person represents the claims of all the sisters, he or she can claim the dignity as a matter of right, and the abeyance is said to be terminated.<ref name=\"Chisholm\"/>  On the other hand, the number of prospective heirs can grow quite large, since each share potentially can be divided between daughters, where the owner of a share dies without leaving a son.\n\nA co-heir may petition the Crown for a termination of the abeyance. The Crown may choose to grant the petition, but if there is any doubt whatsoever as to the pedigree of the petitioner, the claim is normally referred to the [[Peerage law#Peerage disputes|Committee for Privileges]]. If the claim is unopposed, the Committee will generally award the claim, unless there is evidence of [[collusion]], the peerage has been in abeyance for more than a century, or the petitioner holds less than one-third of the claim.\n\nThis doctrine is a 17th-century innovation, although it is now applied retrospectively for centuries. It cannot be applied perfectly; for example, [[Thomas West, 8th Baron De La Warr|the eighth Baron De La Warr]] had three surviving sons; [[Thomas West, 9th Baron De La Warr|the first]] died without children, the second left two daughters, and the third left a son. In modern law, the title would have fallen into abeyance between the two daughters of the second son, and nobody else would have been able to claim it even if the abeyance were settled; however, in 1597, [[Thomas West, 2nd Baron De La Warr|the grandson of the third son]] (whose [[William West, 1st Baron De La Warr|father]] had been re-created [[Earl De La Warr|Baron De La Warr]] in 1570) claimed the title and its precedence.\n\nIn 1604, the [[Baron le Despencer]] case was the first peerage abeyance ever settled; the second was at the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] in 1660. Most subsequent abeyances (only a few dozen cases) were settled after a few years, in favour of the holder of the family properties; there were two periods in which long-abeyant peerages (in some cases peerages of doubtful reality) were brought back: between 1838 and 1841 and between 1909 and 1921.<ref>[[Complete Peerage]], Vol IV, Appendix H</ref> ''[[The Complete Peerage]]'' reports that only baronies have been called out of abeyance,<ref>Complete Peerage, Vol XI, p. 131 - supplemental number; and Vol IV, Appendix H, p. 725</ref> although the [[Earl of Cromartie|Earldom of Cromartie]] was called out of a two-year abeyance in 1895. The more recent [[Earl of Lucan|Earldom of Lucan]] was a special case; it involved the disappearance of the holder without trace in 1974 and no proof of his death. The title was called out of a forty-two year abeyance in 2016.\n\nIt is entirely possible for a peerage to remain in abeyance for centuries. For example, the [[Baron Grey of Codnor|Barony of Grey of Codnor]] was in abeyance for over 490 years between 1496 and 1989, and the [[Baron Hastings|Barony of Hastings]] was similarly in abeyance for over 299 years from 1542 to 1841. Some other baronies became abeyant in the 13th century, and the abeyance has yet to be terminated. The only titles other than a barony that have yet gone into abeyance are the [[Baron Arlington|earldom of Arlington and the viscountcy of Thetford]], which are united, and (as noted above) the [[Earl of Cromartie|earldom of Cromartie]]; and the earldom of Lucan, as mentioned above.\n\nIt is no longer straightforward to claim English peerages after long abeyances. In 1927 a parliamentary Select Committee on Peerages in Abeyance recommended that no claim should be considered where the abeyance has lasted more than 100 years, nor where the claimant lays claim to less than one third of the dignity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1927/may/31/peerages-in-abeyance|title=PEERAGES IN ABEYANCE.|work=millbanksystems.com|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref> The [[Baron Grey of Codnor|Barony of Grey of Codnor]] was treated as an exception to this principle, as a claim to it had been submitted prior to these recommendations being made to the Sovereign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1989/jul/27/barony-of-grey-of-codnor|title=Barony of Grey of Codnor|work=millbanksystems.com|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nTitles in the [[Peerage of Scotland]] cannot go into abeyance, because in Scottish law the eldest sister is preferred over younger sisters; sisters are not considered equal co-heirs.\n\nIt is common, but incorrect, to speak of peerage dignities which are dormant (i.e. unclaimed) as being in abeyance.<ref name=\"Chisholm\"/>\n\n===Peerages called out of abeyance by year of initial abeyance===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2011}}<!--This list is complete up to 1800:-->\n{{col-begin}}{{col-2}}\n*1426: [[Baron Camoys]], called out of abeyance after 413 years.<ref name=\"C1\">The Peerages of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom.

This may be considered a desirable outcome in cases where the party to the lawsuit is an organization with a transient membership and political perspective.  The use of abeyance in such instances can allow such an organization to 'settle' with the party without officially binding its actions in the future, should a new group of decision makers within the organization choose to pursue taking the dispute to court.\n\nFor example, abeyance was used as a settlement method in a Canadian lawsuit involving the [[University of Victoria Students' Society]] (UVSS), the [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association|BCCLA]], and a campus pro-life club to whom the UVSS denied funding.  The parties agreed to settle the lawsuit by holding the case in abeyance in return for the UVSS temporarily giving resources back to the club.  With this arrangement, the pro-life club held on to its right to immediately reopen the case again should the UVSS deny resources to the club in the future, and the UVSS was able to avoid an expensive legal battle it did not have the will to pursue at the time.  Thus the use of abeyance provided the security of a settlement for the pro-life campus club, while preserving the student society's voting membership's ability to take the matter back to court should they choose in the future to deny resources to the club.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomson |first=Stephen |url=https://www.straight.com/article-334508/vancouver/university-victoria-antiabortion-group-resolves-dispute-student-union |title=University of Victoria anti-abortion group resolves dispute with student union |publisher=Straight.com |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref>\n\nOther court cases may be held in abeyance when the issue may be resolved by another court or another event.

He was professor of astronomy at [[Uppsala University]] from 1730 to 1744, but traveled from 1732 to 1735 visiting notable observatories in Germany, Italy and France. He founded the [[Uppsala Astronomical Observatory]] in 1741, and in 1742 proposed the [[Celsius]] [[temperature]] scale which bears his name.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAnders Celsius was born in [[Uppsala]], Sweden on 27 November 1701. His family originated from [[Ovan\u00e5ker]] in the province of [[H\u00e4lsingland]]. Their family estate was at ''[[Doma, Ovan\u00e5ker Municipality|Doma]]'', also known as ''H\u00f6jen'' or ''H\u00f6gen'' (locally as ''H\u00f6gen 2''). The name ''Celsius'' is a latinization of the estate's name (Latin ''celsus'' \"mound\").\n\nAs the son of an astronomy professor, [[Nils Celsius]], and the grandson of the mathematician [[Magnus Celsius]] and the astronomer Anders Spole, Celsius chose a career in science. He was a talented mathematician from an early age. Anders Celsius studied at Uppsala University, where his father was a teacher, and in 1730 he, too, became a professor of astronomy there.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1730, Celsius published the {{lang|la|Nova Methodus distantiam solis a terra determinandi}} (''New Method for Determining the Distance from the Earth to the Sun''). His research also involved the study of auroral phenomena, which he conducted with his assistant [[Hiorter|Olof Hiorter]], and he was the first to suggest a connection between the [[aurora borealis]] and changes in the magnetic field of the Earth.<ref name=\"notablebiographies.com\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Ca-Ch/Celsius-Anders.html\n|title=Anders Celsius\n|publisher=notablebiographies.com\n|accessdate=24 June 2008}}</ref> He observed the variations of a compass needle and found that larger deflections correlated with stronger auroral activity. At [[Nuremberg]] in 1733, he published a collection of 316 observations of the aurora borealis made by himself and others over the period 1716\u20131732.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Celsius, Anders|volume=1|page=609}}</ref>\n\nCelsius traveled frequently in the early 1730s, including to Germany, Italy and France, when he visited most of the major European observatories. In Paris he advocated the measurement of an [[arc of the meridian]] in [[Laponia (historical province)|Lapland]]. In 1736, he participated in the expedition organized for that purpose by the [[French Academy of Sciences]], led by the French mathematician [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] (1698\u20131759) to measure a degree of [[latitude]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The aim of the expedition was to measure the length of a degree along a meridian, close to the pole, and compare the result with a similar expedition to [[Peru]], today in [[Ecuador]], near the [[equator]]. The expeditions confirmed [[Isaac Newton]]'s belief that the shape of the earth is an [[ellipsoid]] flattened at the poles.<ref name=\"astro.uu.se\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.astro.uu.se/history/Celsius_eng.html\n|title=Anders Celsius\n|publisher=Uppsala Astronomical Observatory\n|accessdate=24 June 2008\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080624083824/http://www.astro.uu.se/history/Celsius_eng.html| archivedate= 24 June 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> '''\n[[Image:AndersCelsiusyoung.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Anders Celsius c. 1730s]]\nIn 1738, he published the {{lang|la|De observationibus pro figura telluris determinanda}} (''Observations on Determining the Shape of the Earth''). Celsius' participation in the Lapland expedition won him much respect in Sweden with the government and his peers, and played a key role in generating interest from the Swedish authorities in donating the resources required to construct a new modern observatory in Uppsala. He was successful in the request, and Celsius founded the [[Uppsala Astronomical Observatory]] in 1741. The observatory was equipped with instruments purchased during his long voyage abroad, comprising the most modern instrumental technology of the period.\n\nIn astronomy, Celsius began a series of observations using colored glass plates to record the magnitude (a measure of brightness) of certain stars. This was the first attempt to measure the intensity of starlight with a tool other than the human eye. He made observations of eclipses and various astronomical objects and published catalogues of carefully determined magnitudes for some 300 stars using his own photometric system (mean error=0.4 mag).<ref name=\"astro.uu.se\"/>\n\nCelsius was the first to perform and publish careful experiments aiming at the definition of an international [[temperature]] [[Celsius|scale]] on scientific grounds. In his Swedish paper \"Observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer\" he reports on experiments to check that the freezing point is independent of latitude (and of atmospheric pressure).<ref>Celsius, Anders (1742) [https://archive.org/stream/kungligasvenskav1317kung#page/170/mode/2up/search \"Observationer om tw\u00e4nne best\u00e4ndiga grader p\u00e5 en thermometer\"] (Observations about two stable degrees on a thermometer), ''Kungliga Svenska Vetenskapsakademiens Handlingar'' (Proceedings of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences), '''3''' :  171-180 and [https://archive.org/stream/kungligasvenskav1317kung#page/232/mode/2up Fig. 1.]</ref> He determined the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure which was accurate even by modern-day standards. He further gave a rule for the determination of the boiling point if the barometric pressure deviates from a certain standard pressure.<ref name=history>[http://www.astro.uu.se/history/celsius_scale.html History of the Celsius temperature scale]</ref> He proposed the Celsius temperature scale in a paper to the [[Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala]], the oldest Swedish scientific society, founded in 1710. His thermometer was calibrated with a value of 100\u00b0 for the freezing point of water and 0\u00b0 for the boiling point. In 1745, a year after Celsius' death, the scale was reversed by [[Carl Linnaeus]] to facilitate more practical measurement.<ref name=reversed>[http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/6_32.html Linnaeus' thermometer]</ref> Celsius originally called his scale centigrade derived from the Latin for \"hundred steps\". For years it was simply referred to as the Swedish thermometer.\n[[Image:UppsalaCelsiusObservatory Busser.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The observatory of Anders Celsius, from a contemporary engraving.]]\nCelsius conducted many geographical measurements for the Swedish General map, and was one of earliest to note that much of Scandinavia is slowly rising above sea level, a continuous process which has been occurring since the melting of the ice from the latest [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]]. However, he wrongly posed the notion that the water was [[evaporating]].<ref name=\"astro.uu.se\"/>\n\nIn 1725 he became secretary of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, and served at this post until his death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1744. He supported the formation of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in [[Stockholm]] in 1739 by Linnaeus and five others, and was elected a member at the first meeting of this academy. It was in fact Celsius who proposed the new academy's name.<ref>[http://runeberg.org/nfcl/0071.html Nordisk familjebok, volume 32 (1921): Vetenskapsakademin] {{sv icon}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Celsius family]]\n\n== References ==\n[[Image:Gamla uppsala kyrka.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Celsius is buried at Uppsala Church in Gamla Uppsala next to his grandfather]]\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Scientists whose names are used as SI units}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Celsius, Anders}}\n[[Category:1701 births]]\n[[Category:1744 deaths]]\n[[Category:Swedish astronomers]]\n[[Category:18th-century deaths from tuberculosis]]\n[[Category:People from Uppsala]]\n[[Category:Uppsala University alumni]]\n[[Category:Uppsala University faculty]]\n[[Category:Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Tuberculosis deaths in Sweden]]\n[[Category:18th-century Swedish scientists]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:18th-century astronomers]]\n[[Category:Age of Liberty people]]", "sha1": "l7u8aebz30i2i7drrzwkbhrgi3ecpb4"}}, {"title": "Adam Carolla", "ns": "0", "id": "2723", "revision": {"id": "865928704", "parentid": "865917972", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T03:07:51Z", "contributor": {"ip": "65.131.235.181"}, "comment": "/* Personal life */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2018}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name = Adam Carolla\n| image = 2017-02-25_Adam_Carolla.jpg\n| caption = Carolla in 2012\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1964|5|27}}\n| birth_place = [[Los Angeles County]], [[California]], U.S.\n| residence = \n| alias = Ace Rockolla, Jules Dash\n| occupation = Radio personality<br>television presenter<br>comedian<br>actor<br>author<br>[[podcaster]]<br>singer\n| known = ''Loveline'' (radio show)<br> [[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|''The Adam Carolla Show'' (podcast)]]<br>[[The Adam Carolla Show (radio)|''The Adam Carolla Show'' (radio show)]]\n| salary = \n| television = ''[[Loveline]]''<br>''[[The Man Show]]''<br>''[[Crank Yankers]]''<br>''[[Too Late with Adam Carolla]]''<br>''[[The Adam Carolla Project]]''<br> ''[[Catch a Contractor]]''\n| boards = [[Marijuana Policy Project]] (advisory board)<ref name=MPP_Board>{{cite web |title=MPP Advisory Board |url=http://www.mpp.org/vip/ |publisher=[[Marijuana Policy Project]] |accessdate=March 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66ADLLlLM?url=http://www.mpp.org/vip/ |archivedate=March 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>\n| spouse = Lynette Paradise (2002\u2013present)\n| children = 2\n| relations = \n| website = {{URL|adamcarolla.com | AdamCarolla.com}}\n| religion = \n}}\n'''Adam Carolla''' ({{IPAc-en|k|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u0252|l|\u0259}}; born May 27, 1964) is an American comedian, radio personality, television host, actor, podcaster, and director.

Informally, it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them. The analysis of autocorrelation is a mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns, such as the presence of a [[periodic signal]] obscured by [[noise (signal processing)|noise]], or identifying the [[missing fundamental frequency]]  in a signal implied by its [[harmonic]] frequencies. It is often used in [[signal processing]] for analyzing functions or series of values, such as [[time domain]] signals.\n\n[[Unit root]] processes,  [[trend stationary]] processes, [[autoregressive process]]es, and [[moving average process]]es are specific forms of processes with autocorrelation.\n\n==Definitions==\n\nDifferent fields of study define autocorrelation differently, and not all of these definitions are equivalent. In some fields, the term is used interchangeably with [[autocovariance]].\n\n===Statistics===\nIn [[statistics]], the autocorrelation of a [[random process]] is the [[Pearson correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation]] between values of the process at different times, as a function of the two times or of the time lag {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Let ''X'' be a random process, and ''t'' be any point in time (''t'' may be an [[integer]] for a [[discrete-time]] process or a [[real number]] for a [[continuous-time]] process). Then ''X''<sub>''t''</sub> is the value (or [[Realization (probability)|realization]]) produced by a given [[Execution (computing)|run]] of the process at time ''t''. Suppose that the process has [[mean]] ''\u03bc<sub>t</sub>'' and [[variance]] ''\u03c3<sub>t</sub><sup>2</sup>'' at time ''t'', for each ''t''. Then the definition of the autocorrelation between times ''s'' and ''t'' is\n\n:<math>\nR(s,t) = \\frac{\\operatorname{E}[(X_t - \\mu_t)(X_s - \\mu_s)]}{\\sigma_t\\sigma_s}\\, ,\n</math>\n\nwhere \"E\" is the [[expected value]] operator. Note that this expression is not well-defined for all-time series or processes, because the mean may not exist, or the variance may be zero (for a constant process) or infinite (for processes with distribution lacking well-behaved moments, such as certain types of power law). If the function ''R'' is well-defined, its value must lie in the range [\u22121,&nbsp;1], with 1 indicating perfect correlation and \u22121 indicating perfect [[anti-correlation]]. <!--Maybe we should put all definitions of variables next to the equations so that people know what we're talking about.-->\n\nIf ''X''<sub>''t''</sub> is a [[wide-sense stationary process]] then the mean ''\u03bc'' and the variance ''\u03c3<sup>2</sup>'' are time-independent, and further the autocorrelation depends only on the lag between ''t'' and ''s'': the correlation depends only on the time-distance between the pair of values but not on their position in time. This further implies that the autocorrelation can be expressed as a function of the time-lag, and that this would be an [[even function]] of the lag  ''\u03c4''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''t''. This gives the more familiar form\n\n:<math>\nR(\\tau) = \\frac{\\operatorname{E}[(X_t - \\mu)(X_{t+\\tau} - \\mu)]}{\\sigma^2}, \\,\n</math>\n\nand the fact that this is an [[even function]] can be stated as\n:<math>\nR(\\tau) = R(-\\tau).\\,\n</math>\n\nIt is common practice in some disciplines, other than statistics and [[time series analysis]], to drop the normalization by ''\u03c3<sup>2</sup>'' and use the term \"autocorrelation\" interchangeably with \"autocovariance\". However, the normalization is important both because the interpretation of the autocorrelation as a correlation provides a scale-free measure of the strength of [[statistical dependence]], and because the normalization has an effect on the statistical properties of the estimated autocorrelations.\n\n===Signal processing===\n\nIn [[signal processing]], the above definition is often used without the normalization, that is, without subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance. When the autocorrelation function is normalized by mean and variance, it is sometimes referred to as the '''autocorrelation coefficient'''<ref name=\"dunn\">{{cite book |first=Patrick F. |last=Dunn |title=Measurement and Data Analysis for Engineering and Science |location=New York |publisher=McGraw\u2013Hill |year=2005 |isbn=0-07-282538-3 }}</ref> or autocovariance function.\n\nGiven a [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] <math>f(t)</math>, the continuous autocorrelation <math>R_{ff}(\\tau)</math> is most often defined as the continuous cross-correlation integral of <math>f(t)</math> with itself, at lag <math>\\tau</math>.\n\n:<math>R_{ff}(\\tau) = (f * g_{-1}(\\overline{f}))(\\tau) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(u+\\tau)\\overline{f}(u)\\, {\\rm d}u = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(u)\\overline{f}(u-\\tau)\\, {\\rm d}u</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\overline{f}</math> represents the [[complex conjugate]], <math>g_{-1}</math> is a function which manipulates the function <math>f</math> and is defined as <math>g_{-1}(f)(u)=f(-u)</math> and <math>*</math> represents [[convolution]].\n\nFor a [[real function]], <math>\\overline{f} = f</math>.\n\nNote that the parameter <math>u</math> in the integral is a dummy variable and is only necessary to calculate the integral. It has no specific meaning.\n\nThe discrete autocorrelation <math>R</math> at lag <math>\\ell</math> for a discrete signal <math>y(n)</math> is\n\n:<math>R_{yy}(\\ell) = \\sum_{n \\in Z} y(n)\\,\\overline{y}(n-\\ell).</math>\n\nThe above definitions work for signals that are square integrable, or square summable, that is, of finite energy. Signals that \"last forever\" are treated instead as random processes, in which case different definitions are needed, based on expected values. For [[stationary process|wide-sense-stationary random processes]], the autocorrelations are defined as\n\n:<math>R_{ff}(\\tau) = \\operatorname{E}\\left[f(t)\\overline{f}(t-\\tau)\\right]</math>\n:<math>R_{yy}(\\ell) = \\operatorname{E}\\left[y(n)\\,\\overline{y}(n-\\ell)\\right].</math>\n\nFor processes that are not [[Stationary process|stationary]], these will also be functions of <math>t</math>, or <math>n</math>.\n\nFor processes that are also [[Ergodic process|ergodic]], the expectation can be replaced by the limit of a time average. The autocorrelation of an ergodic process is sometimes defined as or equated to<ref name=\"dunn\"/>\n\n:<math>R_{ff}(\\tau) = \\lim_{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac 1 T \\int_0^T f(t+\\tau)\\overline{f}(t)\\, {\\rm d}t</math>\n:<math>R_{yy}(\\ell) = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac 1 N \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} y(n)\\,\\overline{y}(n-\\ell).</math>\n\nThese definitions have the advantage that they give sensible well-defined single-parameter results for periodic functions, even when those functions are not the output of stationary ergodic processes.\n\nAlternatively, signals that ''last forever'' can be treated by a short-time autocorrelation function analysis, using finite time integrals. (See [[short-time Fourier transform]] for a related process.)\n\nMulti-[[dimension]]al autocorrelation is defined similarly. For example, in [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] the autocorrelation of a square-summable [[discrete signal]] would be\n\n:<math>R(j,k,\\ell) = \\sum_{n,q,r} x_{n,q,r}\\,x_{n-j,q-k,r-\\ell}.</math>\n\nWhen mean values are subtracted from signals before computing an autocorrelation function, the resulting function is usually called an auto-covariance function.\n\n==Properties==\n\nIn the following, we will describe properties of one-dimensional autocorrelations only, since most properties are easily transferred from the one-dimensional case to the multi-dimensional cases. These properties hold for [[Stationary process#Weak or wide-sense stationarity|wide-sense stationary processes]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Proakis|first1=John|title=Communication Systems Engineering (2nd Edition)|date=August 31, 2001|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0130617934|page=168|edition=2}}</ref>\n\n* A fundamental property of the autocorrelation is symmetry, <math>R(i) = R(-i)</math>, which is easy to prove from the definition. In the continuous case,\n:the autocorrelation is an [[even function]]\n\n::<math>R_f(-\\tau) = R_f(\\tau)\\,</math> when <math>f</math> is a real function,\n\n:and the autocorrelation is a [[Hermitian function]]\n\n::<math>R_f(-\\tau) = R_f^*(\\tau)\\,</math> when <math>f</math> is a [[complex function]].\n\n* The continuous autocorrelation function reaches its peak at the origin, where it takes a real value, i.e. for any delay <math>\\tau</math>, <math>|R_f(\\tau)| \\leq R_f(0)</math>. This is a consequence of the [[rearrangement inequality]]. The same result holds in the discrete case.\n* The autocorrelation of a [[periodic function]] is, itself, periodic with the same period.\n* The autocorrelation of the sum of two completely uncorrelated functions (the cross-correlation is zero for all <math>\\tau</math>) is the sum of the autocorrelations of each function separately.\n* Since autocorrelation is a specific type of [[cross-correlation]], it maintains all the properties of cross-correlation.\n* The autocorrelation of a continuous-time [[white noise]] signal will have a strong peak (represented by a [[Dirac delta function]]) at <math>\\tau=0</math> and will be exactly 0 for all other <math>\\tau</math>.\n* The [[Wiener\u2013Khinchin theorem]] relates the autocorrelation function to the [[spectral density|power spectral density]] via the [[Fourier transform]]:\n\n::<math>R(\\tau) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty S(f) e^{j 2 \\pi f \\tau} \\, {\\rm d}f</math>\n\n::<math>S(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty R(\\tau) e^{- j 2 \\pi f \\tau} \\, {\\rm d}\\tau.</math>\n\n* For real-valued functions, the symmetric autocorrelation function has a real symmetric transform, so the [[Wiener\u2013Khinchin theorem]] can be re-expressed in terms of real cosines only:\n\n::<math>R(\\tau) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty S(f) \\cos(2 \\pi f \\tau) \\, {\\rm d}f</math>\n\n::<math>S(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty R(\\tau) \\cos(2 \\pi f \\tau) \\, {\\rm d}\\tau.</math>\n\n==Efficient computation==\nFor data expressed as a [[Discrete signal|discrete]] sequence, it is frequently necessary to compute the autocorrelation with high [[algorithmic efficiency|computational efficiency]]. A brute force method based on the signal processing definition <math>R_{xx}(j) = \\sum_n x_n\\,\\overline{x}_{n-j}</math> can be used when the signal size is small. For example, to calculate the autocorrelation of the real signal sequence <math>x = (2,3,-1)</math> (i.e. <math>x_0=2, x_1=3, x_2=-1</math>, and <math>x_i=0</math> for all other values of {{mvar|i}}) by hand, we first recognize that the definition just given is same as the \"usual\" multiplication, but with right shifts, where each vertical addition gives the autocorrelation for particular lag values:\n:<math>\\begin{array}{rrrrrr}\n       & 2 & 3 & -1 \\\\\n\\times & 2 & 3 & -1 \\\\\n\\hline\n       &-2 &-3 & 1 \\\\\n       &   & 6 & 9 & -3 \\\\\n     + &   &   & 4 & 6 & -2 \\\\\n\\hline\n       & -2 & 3 &14 & 3 & -2\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nThus the required autocorrelation sequence is <math>R_{xx}=(-2,3,14,3,-2)</math>, where <math>R_{xx}(0)=14,</math> <math>R_{xx}(-1)= R_{xx}(1)=3,</math> and <math>R_{xx}(-2)= R_{xx}(2) = -2,</math> the autocorrelation for other lag values being zero. In this calculation we do not perform the carry-over operation during addition as is usual in normal multiplication. Note that we can halve the number of operations required by exploiting the inherent symmetry of the autocorrelation. If the signal happens to be periodic, i.e. <math>x=(\\ldots,2,3,-1,2,3,-1,\\ldots),</math> then we get a circular autocorrelation (similar to [[circular convolution]]) where the left and right tails of the previous autocorrelation sequence will overlap and give <math>R_{xx}=(\\ldots,14,1,1,14,1,1,\\ldots)</math> which has the same period as the signal sequence <math>x.</math> The procedure can be regarded as an application of the convolution property of [[z-transform]] of a discrete signal.\n\nWhile the brute force algorithm is [[Big O notation|order]] {{math|''n''<sup>2</sup>}}, several efficient algorithms exist which can compute the autocorrelation in order {{math|''n'' log(''n'')}}. For example, the [[Wiener\u2013Khinchin theorem]] allows computing the autocorrelation from the raw data {{math|''X''(''t'')}} with two [[fast Fourier transform]]s (FFT):<ref>{{cite book |last=Box |first=G.

The asterisk denotes [[complex conjugate]].\n\nAlternatively, a multiple {{mvar|\u03c4}} correlation can be performed by using brute force calculation for low {{mvar|\u03c4}} values, and then progressively binning the {{math|''X''(''t'')}} data with a [[logarithm]]ic density to compute higher values, resulting in the same {{math|''n'' log(''n'')}} efficiency, but with lower memory requirements.<ref>{{cite book |first=D. |last=Frenkel |first2=B. |last2=Smit |title=Understanding Molecular Simulation |edition=2nd |location=London |publisher=Academic Press |year=2002 |chapter=chap. 4.4.2 |isbn=0122673514 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Colberg |first2=F. |last2=H\u00f6fling |title=Highly accelerated simulations of glassy dynamics using GPUs: caveats on limited floating-point precision |journal=[[Computer Physics Communications|Comp.

Other estimates can suffer from the problem that, if they are used to calculate the variance of a linear combination of the <math>X</math>'s, the variance calculated may turn out to be negative. <!--and how is this a problem?-->\n\n==Regression analysis==\n\nIn [[regression analysis]] using [[time series analysis|time series data]], autocorrelation in a variable of interest is typically modeled either with an [[autoregressive model]] (AR), a [[moving average model]] (MA), their combination as an [[autoregressive-moving-average model]] (ARMA), or an extension of the latter called an [[autoregressive integrated moving average model]] (ARIMA). With multiple interrelated data series, [[vector autoregression]] (VAR) or its extensions are used.\n\nIn [[ordinary least squares]] (OLS), the adequacy of a model specification can be checked in part by establishing whether there is autocorrelation of the [[errors and residuals in statistics|regression residuals]]. \nProblematic autocorrelation of the errors, which themselves are unobserved, can generally be detected because it produces autocorrelation in the observable residuals. (Errors are also known as \"error terms\" in [[econometrics]].) Autocorrelation of the errors violates the ordinary least squares assumption that the error terms are uncorrelated, meaning that the [[Gauss\u2013Markov theorem|Gauss Markov theorem]] does not apply, and that OLS estimators are no longer the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators ([[BLUE]]). While it does not bias the OLS coefficient estimates, the [[Standard error (statistics)|standard errors]] tend to be underestimated (and the [[T-statistics|t-scores]] overestimated) when the autocorrelations of the errors at low lags are positive.\n\nThe traditional test for the presence of first-order autocorrelation is the [[Durbin\u2013Watson statistic]] or, if the explanatory variables include a lagged dependent variable, [[Durbin\u2013Watson statistic#Durbin h-statistic|Durbin's h statistic]]. The Durbin-Watson can be linearly mapped however to the Pearson correlation between values and their lags.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://statisticalideas.blogspot.com/2014/05/serial-correlation-techniques.html|title=Statistical Ideas: Serial correlation techniques|publisher=}}</ref>  A more flexible test, covering autocorrelation of higher orders and applicable whether or not the regressors include lags of the dependent variable, is the [[Breusch\u2013Godfrey test]]. This involves an auxiliary regression, wherein the residuals obtained from estimating the model of interest are regressed on (a) the original regressors and (b) ''k'' lags of the residuals, where 'k' is the order of the test. The simplest version of the test statistic from this\nauxiliary regression is ''TR''<sup>2</sup>, where ''T'' is the sample size and ''R''<sup>2</sup> is the [[coefficient of determination]]. Under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation, this statistic is\nasymptotically distributed as <math>\\chi^2</math> with ''k'' degrees of freedom.\n\nResponses to nonzero autocorrelation include [[generalized least squares]] and the [[Newey West|Newey\u2013West HAC estimator]] (Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent).<ref>{{cite book | title = An Introduction to Modern Econometrics Using Stata |first= Christopher F. |last=Baum  | publisher = Stata Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-59718-013-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the estimation of a [[moving average model]] (MA), the autocorrelation function is used to determine the appropriate number of lagged error terms to be included. This is based on the fact that for an MA process of order ''q'', we have <math>R(\\tau) \\neq 0</math>, for <math> \\tau = 0,1, \\ldots , q</math>, and <math> R(\\tau) = 0</math>, for <math>\\tau >q</math>.\n\n==Applications==\n\n* Autocorrelation analysis is used heavily in [[fluorescence correlation spectroscopy]].\n* Another application of autocorrelation is the measurement of [[optical spectrum|optical spectra]] and the measurement of very-short-duration [[light]] [[ultrashort pulse|pulses]] produced by [[laser]]s, both using [[optical autocorrelation|optical autocorrelators]].\n* Autocorrelation is used to analyze [[dynamic light scattering]] data, which notably enables determination of the [[particle size distribution]]s of nanometer-sized particles or [[micelle]]s suspended in a fluid. A laser shining into the mixture produces a [[speckle pattern]] that results from the motion of the particles. Autocorrelation of the signal can be analyzed in terms of the diffusion of the particles. From this, knowing the viscosity of the fluid, the sizes of the particles can be calculated.\n* The [[small-angle X-ray scattering]] intensity of a nanostructured system is the Fourier transform of the spatial autocorrelation function of the electron density.\n* In optics, normalized autocorrelations and cross-correlations give the [[degree of coherence]] of an electromagnetic field.\n* In [[signal processing]], autocorrelation can give information about repeating events like [[music]]al [[Beat (music)|beat]]s (for example, to determine [[tempo]]) or [[pulsar]] [[frequency|frequencies]], though it cannot tell the position in time of the beat. It can also be used to [[Pitch detection algorithm|estimate the pitch of a musical tone]].\n* In [[Music Recording|music recording]], autocorrelation is used as a [[pitch detection algorithm]] prior to vocal processing, as a distortion effect or to eliminate undesired mistakes and inaccuracies.<ref>{{Cite news\n  | last1 = Tyrangiel | first1 = Josh\n  | title = Auto-Tune: Why Pop Music Sounds Perfect\n  | newspaper = Time Magazine\n  | date = 2009-02-05\n  | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1877372,00.html}}</ref>\n\n* Autocorrelation in space rather than time, via the [[Patterson function]], is used by X-ray diffractionists to help recover the \"Fourier phase information\" on atom positions not available through diffraction alone.\n* In statistics, spatial autocorrelation between sample locations also helps one estimate [[Variance#Generalizations|mean value uncertainties]] when sampling a heterogeneous population.\n* The [[SEQUEST]] algorithm for analyzing [[Mass spectrum|mass spectra]] makes use of autocorrelation in conjunction with [[cross-correlation]] to score the similarity of an observed spectrum to an idealized spectrum representing a [[peptide]].\n* In [[astrophysics]], autocorrelation is used to study and characterize the spatial distribution of [[Galaxy|galaxies]] in the universe and in multi-wavelength observations of low mass [[X-ray binary|X-ray binaries]].\n* In [[panel data]], spatial autocorrelation refers to correlation of a variable with itself through space.\n* In analysis of [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] data, autocorrelation must be taken into account for correct error determination.\n* In geosciences (specifically in geophysics) it can be used to compute an autocorrelation seismic attribute, out of a 3D seismic survey of the underground.\n* In [[medical ultrasound]] imaging, autocorrelation is used to visualize blood flow.\n* In [[intertemporal portfolio choice]], the presence or absence of autocorrelation in an asset's [[rate of return]] can affect the optimal portion of the portfolio to hold in that asset.\n\n== Serial dependence ==\n'''Serial dependence''' is closely linked to the notion of autocorrelation, but represents a distinct concept (see [[Correlation and dependence]]). In particular, it is possible to have serial dependence but no (linear) correlation. In some fields however, the two terms are used as synonyms.\n\nA  [[time series]] of a [[random variable]] has serial dependence if the value at some time ''t'' in the series is [[Statistical independence|statistically dependent]] on the value at another time ''s''. A series is serially independent if there is no dependence between any pair.\n\nIf a time series {''X<sub>t</sub>''} is [[Stationary process|stationary]], then statistical dependence between the pair (''X<sub>t</sub>&nbsp;,&nbsp;X<sub>s</sub>'') would imply that there is statistical dependence between all pairs of values at the same lag ''s''&#x2212;''t''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Autocorrelation matrix]]\n* [[Autocorrelation technique]]\n* [[Autocorrelation (words)|Autocorrelation of a formal word]]\n* [[Autocorrelator]]\n* [[Correlation function]]\n* [[Correlogram]]\n* [[Cross-correlation]]\n* [[Galton's problem]]\n* [[Partial autocorrelation function]]\n* [[Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy]]\n* [[Optical autocorrelation]]\n* [[Pitch detection algorithm]]\n* [[Triple correlation]]\n* [[Variance]]\n* [[CUSUM]]\n* [[Cochrane\u2013Orcutt estimation]] (transformation for autocorrelated error terms)\n* [[Prais\u2013Winsten transformation]]\n* [[Scaled Correlation]]\n* [[Unbiased estimation of standard deviation#Effect of autocorrelation (serial correlation)|Unbiased estimation of standard deviation]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Kmenta |first=Jan |authorlink=Jan Kmenta |title=Elements of Econometrics |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |year=1986 |edition=Second |isbn=0-02-365070-2 |pages=298\u2013334 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Verbeek |first=Marno |title=A Guide to Modern Econometrics |location=Chichester |publisher=John Wiley |edition=Fourth |year=2012 |pages=112\u2013116 |isbn=978-1-119-95167-4 }}\n* Mojtaba Soltanalian, and Petre Stoica. \"[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142119 Computational design of sequences with good correlation properties].\" IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 60.5 (2012): 2180\u20132193.\n* Solomon W.

([http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/CU-Rep-1-AA.pdf Original scan])</ref> was a [[programming language]] developed around 1965 at [[Manchester University]]. A variant of the [[ALGOL]] [[programming language]], it was developed by [[Tony Brooker]] and Derrick Morris for the [[Atlas Computer]]. \n\n(\"Autocode\" was basically an early term for \"programming language\"; different autocodes could be totally different).\n \n==Features==\n\nIt removed some Algol features such as \"[[Call by name#Call by name|passing parameters by name]]\" (which in Algol 60 means passing the address of a short subroutine to recalculate the parameter each time it was mentioned). \n\nIt featured explicitly typed variables, subroutines, and functions. \n\nThe AA compiler generated range-checking for array accesses, and allowed an array to have dimensions that were determined at run-time (i.e. you could declare an array as <code><u>integer</u> <u>array</u> Thing (i:j)</code>, where <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> were calculated values).\n\n[[Machine code]] could be included within the high-level AA routines either to make an inner loop more efficient or to effect some operation which could not easily be done otherwise.<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\nAtlas Autocode included a <code><u>complex</u></code> data type<ref name=\"AA\" /> to represent [[complex number]]s, partly because of pressure from the [[electrical engineering]] department, as complex numbers are used to represent the behavior of [[alternating current]]. The square root of -1 was represented by <code><u>i</u></code>, which was treated as a fixed complex constant = ''i''.\n\nThe <code><u>complex</u></code> data type was dropped when Atlas Autocode later evolved into the [[Edinburgh IMP]] programming language.  (Imp was an extension of AA and was used to write the [[Edinburgh Multiple Access System|EMAS]] [[operating system]].)\n\nAtlas Autocode's second-greatest claim to fame (after being the progenitor of Imp and EMAS) was that it had many of the features of the original \"[[Compiler-compiler|Compiler Compiler]]\".  A variant of the AA compiler included run-time support for a top-down [[recursive descent parser]].  The style of parser used in the Compiler Compiler was in use continuously at Edinburgh from the 60's until almost the turn of the millennium.\n\nOther [[Autocode]]s were developed for the [[Titan (computer)|Titan computer]], a prototype Atlas 2 at Cambridge, and the [[Ferranti]] Mercury.\n\n==Syntax==\nAtlas Autocode's syntax was largely similar to Algol, though it was influenced by the output device which the author had available, a [[Friden, Inc.|Friden Flexowriter]].  Consequently, it allowed symbols like \"\u00bd\" for \".5\" and the superscript <sup>2</sup> for \"to the power of 2\".  The Flexowriter supported overstriking and therefore AA did as well \u2014 up to three characters could be overstruck as a single symbol.  For example, the character set had no \"\u2191\" symbol, so exponentiation was an overstrike of \"|\" and \"*\".  The aforementioned underlining of keywords could also be done using overstriking.  The language is described in detail in the [http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/atlasautocode.html Atlas Autocode Reference Manual].\n\nOther Flexowriter characters that were found a use in Atlas Autocode were: <code>\u03b1</code> in floating-point numbers, ''e.g.'', <code>3.56\u03b1-7</code> for modern <code>3.56e-7</code> ; <code>\u03b2</code> to mean \"the second half of a 48-bit Atlas memory [[Word (data type)|word]]\"; <code>\u03c0</code> for the mathematical constant [[pi]].\n\nWhen AA was ported to the [[English Electric KDF9]] computer, the character set was changed to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and that compiler has been recovered from an old paper tape by the [http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/ Edinburgh Computer History Project] and is available online, as is a high-quality scan of the original Edinburgh version of the Atlas Autocode manual.<ref name=\"AA_ED\" />\n\nKeywords in AA were distinguishable from other text by being underlined, which was implemented via overstrike in the Flexowriter (compare to bold in Algol). There were also two [[Stropping (syntax)|stropping]] regimes. First, there was an \"uppercasedelimiters\" mode where all uppercase letters (outside strings) were treated as underlined lowercase. Second, in some versions (but not in the original Atlas version), it was possible to strop keywords by placing a \"<code>%</code>\" sign in front of them, for example the keyword <code><u>endofprogramme</u></code> could be typed as <code>%end %of %programme</code> or <code>%endofprogramme</code>. This significantly reduced typing, due to only needing one character, rather than overstriking the whole keyword. As in Algol, there were no [[reserved word]]s in the language as keywords were identified by underlining (or stropping), not by recognising reserved character sequences. In the statement <code><u>if</u> token=if <u>then</u> <u>result</u> = token</code>, there is both a keyword <code><u>if</u></code> and a variable named <code>if</code>.\n\nAs in Algol, AA allowed spaces in variable names, such as <code><u>integer</u> previous value</code>. Spaces were not significant and were removed before parsing in a trivial pre-lexing stage called \"[[line reconstruction]]\". What the compiler would see in the above example would be \"<code><u>if</u>token=if<u>thenresult</u>=token</code>\". Spaces were possible due partly to keywords being distinguished in other ways, and partly because the source was processed by a [[scannerless parser]], without a separate lexing phase, which allowed the lexical syntax to be context-sensitive.\n\nThe syntax for expressions let the multiplication operator be omitted, e.g. <code>3a</code> was treated as <code>3*a</code>, and <code>a(i+j)</code> was treated as <code>a*(i+j)</code> if <code>a</code> was not an array. In ambiguous usages, the longest possible name was taken ([[maximal munch]]), for example <code>ab</code> was not treated as <code>a*b</code>, whether or not <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> had been declared.\n\nIn the original Atlas Autocode for the Atlas computer, Atlas machine code instructions could be interpolated between the Atlas Autocode statements.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{More footnotes|date=September 2009}}\n* [http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/atlasautocode.html Atlas Autocode Reference Manual]\n* [http://compsoc.nuigalway.ie/~bfoley/edhist/CU-Rep-1-AA/CU-Rep-1-AA.html Programming In Atlas Autocode] - Edinburgh University Computer Unit Report #1 (1965).

The format was common on [[NeXT]] systems and on early Web pages. Originally it was headerless, being simply 8-bit [[mu-law|\u00b5-law]]-encoded data at an 8000&nbsp;Hz sample rate. Hardware from other vendors often used sample rates as high as 8192&nbsp;Hz, often integer factors of video clock signals. Newer files have a header that consists of six [[Signedness|unsigned]] [[32-bit]] words, an optional information chunk and then the data (in [[big endian]] format).\n\nAlthough the format now supports many [[digital audio|audio encoding]] formats, it remains associated with the [[mu-law|\u00b5-law]] logarithmic encoding. This encoding was native to the [[SPARCstation 1]] hardware, where [[SunOS]] exposed the encoding to application programs through the /dev/audio interface. This encoding and interface became a [[de facto]] standard for [[Unix]] sound.\n\n==New format==\nAll fields are stored in [[big-endian]] format, including the sample data.\n{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! 32 bit word (unsigned)\n! field\n!

Formats 2 through 7 are uncompressed linear [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]], therefore technically [[lossless]] (although not necessarily free of [[Quantization (signal_processing)|quantization error]], especially in 8-bit form). Formats 1 and 27 are [[\u03bc-law algorithm|\u03bc-law]] and [[A-law]], respectively, both [[companding]] logarithmic representations of PCM, and arguably lossy as they pack what would otherwise be almost 16 bits of dynamic range into 8 bits of encoded data, even though this is achieved by an altered dynamic response and no data is actually \"thrown away\". Formats 23 through 26 are ADPCM, which is an early form of [[lossy compression]], usually but not always with 4 bits of encoded data per audio sample (for 4:1 efficiency with 16-bit input, or 2:1 with 8-bit; equivalent to e.g. encoding CD quality MP3 at a 352kbit rate using a low quality encoder). Several of the others are [[digital signal processing|DSP]] commands or data, designed to be processed by the [[NeXT]] [[Music Kit]] software.\n\nNote: PCM formats are encoded as signed data (as opposed to unsigned).\n\nFollowing the header structure is a variable-length annotation field.  The contents of this field are currently undefined, except that its length must be a multiple of eight bytes and it must be terminated with at least one null (zero) byte. The audio data segment begins on an eight-byte boundary immediately following the annotation field. Audio data is encoded in the format identified by the file header. The current implementation supports only a single audio data segment per file. The variable-length annotation field is currently ignored by most audio applications.\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.nch.com.au/acm/sample.au Sample .AU file]\n*[http://pubs.opengroup.org/external/auformat.html Sun .au sound file format]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121028010008/http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/AudioFormats/AU/AU.html Audio File Format Specifications]\n\n{{Compression formats}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Au File Format}}\n[[Category:Computer file formats]]\n[[Category:Digital container formats]]\n[[Category:Audio codecs]]", "sha1": "o9j5y6tx2re5rsvn3vgl64egisgdzpx"}}, {"title": "April 25", "ns": "0", "id": "2733", "revision": {"id": "865719253", "parentid": "865437724", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T18:19:18Z", "contributor": {"username": "Entranced98", "id": "27199084"}, "comment": "/* Births */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about||the 2015 New Zealand documentary film|25 April (film)|the North Korean sports club|April 25 Sports Club}}\n{{pp-pc1}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{calendar}}\n{{This date in recent years}}\n{{Day}}\n\n==Events==\n*[[404 BC]] &ndash; Admiral [[Lysander]] and King [[Pausanias of Sparta]] blockade Athens and bring the [[Peloponnesian War]] to a successful conclusion.\n* [[775]] &ndash; The [[Battle of Bagrevand]] puts an end to an [[Armenians|Armenian]] rebellion against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].

The green symbolizes hope and union, and the white symbolizes peace and dialogue. Blas Infante considered these to have been the colors most used in regional symbols throughout the region's history. According to him, the green came in particular from the [[banner|standard]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] and represented the call for a gathering of the populace. The white symbolized pardon in the [[Almohad dynasty]], interpreted in European heraldry as parliament or peace.

These names derive primarily from past or present political geography: \"Luso\" and \"Lusitanian\" from [[Lusitania]], one of three [[Roman province]]s in Iberia, most of the others from present-day Spanish provinces, and [[Maestrazgo]] being a historical region of northern [[Valencian Community|Valencia]].\n\n[[File:Rododendron.jpg|thumb|left|Oaks, rhododendrons and ferns in the [[Los Alcornocales Natural Park]].]]\nIn broad terms, the typical vegetation of Andalusia is [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub|Mediterranean woodland]], characterized by [[leaf]]y [[Xerophile|xerophilic]] [[perennial plant|perennials]], adapted to the long, dry summers.

The first settlers, based on artifacts from the archaeological sites at [[Los Millares]], [[El Argar]], and [[Tartessos]], were clearly influenced by cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean who arrived on the Andalusian coast.

Between the [[First Punic War|First]] and [[Second Punic War]]s, Carthage extended its control beyond Andalucia to include all of Iberia except the Basque Country. Andalusia was the major staging ground for the war with Rome led by the Carthaginian general [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]]. The Romans defeated the Carthaginians and conquered Andalusia, the region being renamed [[Baetica]].<ref name=Gill/> It was fully incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]], and from this region came many Roman magistrates and senators, as well as the emperors [[Trajan]] and (most likely) [[Hadrian]].\n\n===Vandals, Visigoths and the Byzantine Empire===\nThe Vandals moved briefly through the region during the 5th century AD before settling in North Africa, after which the region fell into the hands of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]]. The [[Visigoths]] in this region were practically independent of the [[Visigothic Kingdom#Catholic Kingdom of Toledo|Visigothic Catholic Kingdom of Toledo]]. This is the era of Saints [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Hermenegild]]. During this period, around 555 AD, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] conquered Andalusia under [[Justinian I]], the [[Eastern Roman Emperor]]. They established [[Spania]], a province of the [[Byzantine Empire]] from 552 until 624. Though their holdings were quickly reduced, they continued to have interests in the region until it was lost altogether in 624.\n\n===Al-Andalus===\n{{Main article|Al-Andalus|Timeline of the Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula}}\n[[File:Al Andalus - 2.png|thumb|250px|The [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in the early 10th century]]\nThe Visigothic era came to an abrupt end in 711 with the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] by the [[Umayyad]] general [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], an [[Islamic]] [[Berber people|Berber]].<ref name=Gill/><!--doesn't mention Tariq or Umayyads--> Tariq is known in Spanish history and legend as a formidable conqueror who dared and bore the nerve to burn his fleet of ships, when he landed with his troops on the coast of Gibraltar \u2013 an acronym of \"Jabel alTariq\" meaning \"the mountain of Tariq\". When the Muslim invaders seized control and consolidated their dominion of the region, they remained tolerant of the Christian religion, but they also needed a place for their own faith. In the 750s, they forcibly rented half of Cordoba's Christian Cathedral of [[Saint Vincent the Deacon|San Vicente]] ([[Visigoth]]ic) to use as a mosque.<ref>Lapunzina, Alejandro (2005).

However, the dramatic articulation of the interior of the prayer hall was unprecedented.  The system of columns supporting double arcades of piers and arches with alternating red and white voussoirs is an unusual treatment that, structurally, combined striking visual effect with the practical advantage of providing greater height within the hall.  Alternating red and white voussoirs are associated with Umayyad monuments such as the Great Mosque of Damascus and the Dome of the Rock. Their use in the Great Mosque of Cordoba manages to create a stunningly original visual composition even as it emphasises 'Abd al-Rahman's connection to the established Umayyad tradition.<ref>https://archnet.org/sites/2715</ref>\n\nIn this period, the name \"[[Al-Andalus]]\" was applied to a much larger area than the present Andalusia, and in some periods it referred to nearly the entire Iberian peninsula. The Muslim rulers of Hispania were economic invaders and interested in collecting taxes; social changes imposed on the native populace were mainly confined to geographical, political and legal conveniences.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Al-Andalus]] remained connected to Christian states under Muslim rule; trade routes between it and [[Constantinople]] and [[Alexandria]] remained open, while many cultural features of the [[Roman Empire]] were transmitted throughout Europe and the Near East by its successor state, the Byzantine Empire.

The Umayyad Caliphate produced such leaders as Caliph [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] (ruled 912\u2013961) and his son, Caliph [[Al-Hakam II]] (ruled 961\u2013976); and built the magnificent [[Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba]].

In the 18th century, commerce from other parts of Spain began to displace Andalusian commerce when the Spanish government ended Andalusia's trading monopoly with the colonies in the Americas. The loss of the empire in the 1820s hurt the economy of the region, particularly the cities that had benefited from the trade and ship building. The construction of railways in the latter part of the 19th century enabled Andalusia to better develop its agricultural potential and it became an exporter of food. While industrialisation was taking off in the northern Spanish regions of Catalonia and the Basque country, Andalusia remained traditional and displayed a deep social division between a small class of wealthy landowners and a population made up largely of poor agricultural labourers and tradesmen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Francoist Oppressions===\n{{main article|White Terror (Spain)}}\n[[File:Women pleading with Rebels for Lives of Prisioners, Constantina, Seville - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Provincia de Sevilla, [[Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola]].]]\nAndalusia was one of the worst affected regions of Spain by [[Francisco Franco]]'s brutal campaign of mass-murder and political suppression called the [[White Terror (Spain)|White Terror]] during and after the [[Spanish Civil War]].

The process to establish Andalusia as an autonomous region followed Article 151 of the Constitution, making Andalusia the only autonomous community to take that particular course.

The Andalusian Autonomous Government is located there. However, the region's highest court, the [[High Court of Andalusia]] (''[[Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Andaluc\u00eda]]'') is not part of the Autonomous Government, and has its seat in [[Granada]].\n\n===Andalusian Autonomous Government===\n{{Main article|Andalusian Autonomous Government}}\n[[File:Partidos Judiciales de Andaluc\u00eda.svg|thumb|325px|[[Legal district]]s of Andalusia.]]\nThe Andalusian Autonomous Government (''Junta de Andaluc\u00eda'') is the institution of self-government of the Autonomous Community of Andalusia. Within the government, the [[President of Andalusia|President of the Regional Government of Andalusia]] is the supreme representative of the autonomous community, and the ordinary representative of the Spanish state in the autonomous community. The president is formally named to the position by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Monarch of Spain]] and then confirmed by a majority vote of the [[Parliament of Andalusia]]. In practice, the monarch always names a person acceptable to the ruling party or coalition of parties in the autonomous region. In theory, were the candidate to fail to gain the needed majority, the monarch could propose a succession of candidates. After two months, if no proposed candidate could gain the parliament's approval, the parliament would automatically be dissolved and the acting president would call new elections.<ref>''Estatuto de Autonom\u00eda Art. 118 Cap.

In a comparison with the Spanish economy, this subsector is virtually the only food that has some weight in the national economy with 16.16%. Lies far behind the manufacturing sector of shipping materials just over 10% of the Spanish economy. Companies like Cruzcampo (Heineken Group), Puleva, Domecq, Santana Motors or Renault-Andalusia, are exponents of these two subsectors. Of note is the Andalusian aeronautical sector, which is second nationally only behind Madrid and represents approximately 21% of total turnover in terms of employment, highlighting companies like [[Airbus]], [[Airbus Military]], or the newly formed Aerospace Alestis.

There were two principal reasons that \"tertiarization\" followed a different course in Andalusia than elsewhere:\n\n1. Andalusian capital found it impossible to compete in the industrial sector against more developed regions, and was obligated to invest in sectors that were easier to enter.\n\n2. The absence of an industrial sector that could absorb displaced agricultural workers and artisans led to the proliferation of services with rather low productivity. This unequal development compared to other regions led to a hypertrophied and unproductive service sector, which has tended to reinforce underdevelopment, because it has not led to large accumulations of capital.<ref name=tertiarization /><ref>{{cite book\n| last = Delgado Cabeza\n| first = Manuel\n| title = Dependencia y marginaci\u00f3n de la econom\u00eda andaluza\n| year = 1981\n| publisher = Publicaciones del Monte de Piedad, Caja de Ahorros\n| location = C\u00f3rdoba\n| isbn = 84-7231-613-0\n| language = Spanish}}</ref>\n\n====Tourism in Andalusia====\n[[File:Rabida1.jpg|thumb|[[La R\u00e1bida Monastery]], [[Palos de la Frontera]], province of Huelva.]]\n[[File:Ronda La Ciudad2004.jpg|thumb|View of [[Ronda]].]]\n[[File:01 Antequera, Andalusia, Spain.jpg|thumb|Royal Collegiate Church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor in [[Antequera]].]]\nDue in part to the relatively mild winter and spring climate, the south of Spain is attractive to overseas visitors\u2013especially tourists from Northern Europe.

There are also popular papers distributed without charge, again typically with local editions that share much of their content.\n\nNo single Andalusian newspaper is distributed throughout the region, not even with local editions. In eastern Andalusia the ''[[Diario Ideal]]'' has editions tailored for the provinces of Almer\u00eda, Granada, and Ja\u00e9n. [[Grupo Joly]] is based in Andalucia, backed by Andalusian capital, and publishes eight daily newspapers there. Efforts to create a newspaper for the entire autonomous region have not succeeded (the most recent as of 2009 was the ''[[Diario de Andaluc\u00eda]]'').

Andalusia has been home to a succession of peoples and civilizations, many very different from one another, each impacting the settled inhabitants. The ancient [[Iberians]] were followed by [[Celts]], [[Phoenicia]]ns and other Eastern Mediterranean traders, [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Migration Period|migrating Germanic tribes]], North African [[Muslim]]s, and the [[Castilian people|Castilians]] and other Spanish of the ''[[Reconquista]]''.

In the words of [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset|Ortega y Gasset]]:\n\n{{quote|Andalusia, which has never shown the swagger nor petulancy of particularism; that has never pretended to the status of a State apart, is, of all the Spanish regions, the one that possesses a culture most radically its own. Throughout the 19th century, Spain has submitted itself to the hegemonic influence of Andalusia. That century began with the [[C\u00e1diz Cortes]]; it ended with the assassination of [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo|C\u00e1novas del Castillo]], ''malague\u00f1o'' [from M\u00e1laga], and the exaltation of [[Francisco Silvela|Silvela]], no less ''malague\u00f1o''. The dominant ideas have an Andalusian accent. One paints Andalusia: a roof-terrace, some flowerpots, blue sky. One reads southern authors. One speaks at all times of the \"land of the Most Holy Virgin Mary\". The thief from the Sierra Morena and the smuggler are national heroes.

Traditional urban houses are constructed with shared walls to minimize exposure to high exterior temperatures.

These images particularly predominated from the 1920s through the 1960s, and helped to consolidate a cliched image of the region. In a very different vein, the province of Almer\u00eda was the filming location for many [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], especially (but by no means exclusively) the Italian-directed [[Spaghetti Western]]s. During the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]], this was the extent of the film industry in Andalusia.\n\nNonetheless, Andalusian film has roots as far back as [[Jos\u00e9 Val del Omar]] in the pre-Franco years, and since the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] has brought forth numerous nationally and internationally respected directors: [[Antonio Cuadri]] (''[[Heart of the Earth]]''), [[Chus Guti\u00e9rrez]] (''[[Poniente (film)|Poniente]]''), [[Chiqui Carabante]] (''[[Carlos Against the World]]''), [[Alberto Rodr\u00edguez Librero|Alberto Rodr\u00edguez]] (''[[7 Virgins]]''), [[Benito Zambrano]] (''[[Solas (film)|Solas]]''), and [[Antonio Banderas]] (''[[Summer Rain (2006 film)|Summer Rain]]'').\n\nCounting together feature films, documentaries, television programs, music videos etc., Andalusia has boomed from 37 projects shooting in 1999 to 1,054 in 2007, with the figure for 2007 including 19 feature films.<ref>[http://www.andaluciafilm.com/Noticias/NoticiasNoticia.asp?desde=3&id=191 Andaluc\u00eda alcanza los 1.000 rodajes gestionados por la Red de Ciudades de Cine de AFC]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2008-07-30, www.andaluciafilm.com.

Each sub-region in Andalusia has its own unique customs that represent a fusion of Catholicism and local folklore. Traditional dress in all areas of Andalusia tends to be colorful and involve various head coverings reminiscent of a Muslim past. Cities like Almer\u00eda have been influenced historically by both [[Granada]] and Murcia in the use of traditional head coverings.  The ''sombrero de Labrador'', a worker's hat made of black velvet, is a signature style of the region.\n\nIn C\u00e1diz, traditional costumes with rural origins are worn at bullfights and at parties on the large estates. The ''tablao flamenco'' dance and the accompanying ''[[cante jondo]]'' vocal style originated in Granada. They are believed to have their roots in oriental, Gregorian, Moorish, and Jewish music. This music is most often performed by the gypsy [[Romani people|Romani]], who are more numerous in Granada than anywhere else in Spain. One of the most distinctive cultural events in Andalusia is the [[Romeria de El Rocio|Romer\u00eda de El Roc\u00edo]] in May. It consists of a pilgrimage to the [[Hermitage of El Roc\u00edo]] in the countryside near [[Almonte, Spain|Almonte]], in honor of the [[Virgin of El Roc\u00edo]], an image of the [[Virgin and Child]],<ref name=travelguides>[http://www.visithuelva.com/travelguides/province_elrocio-thepilgrimage.htm El Rocio Pilgrimage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031134621/http://www.visithuelva.com/travelguides/province_elrocio-thepilgrimage.htm |date=31 October 2015 }}, visithuelva.com.

Saetas evoke strong emotion and are sung most often during public processions. ''Verdiales'', based upon the [[Fandango (dance)|fandango]], are a flamenco music style and song form originating in Almogia, near M\u00e1laga. For this reason, the Verdiales are sometimes known as ''Fandangos de M\u00e1laga.'' The region also has a rich musical tradition of flamenco songs, or [[Palo (flamenco)|palos]] called [[cartageneras]]. Seville celebrates ''[[Holy Week in Seville|Semana Santa]]'', one of the better known religious events within Spain. During the festival, religious fraternities dress as penitents and carry large floats of lifelike wooden sculptures representing scenes of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], and images of the Virgin Mary. [[Sevillanas]], a type of old folk music sung and written in Seville and still very popular, are performed in fairs and festivals, along with an associated dance for the music, the ''Baile por sevillanas''. All the different regions of Andalusia have developed their own distinctive customs, but all share a connectedness to Catholicism and the region's Muslim cultural past.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kern|title=The Regions of Spain|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-29224-8}}</ref>\n\n====Andalusian Spanish====\n{{Main article|Andalusian Spanish}}\n[[File:Andaluc\u00eda ceceante y seseante.PNG|thumb|300px|Most Spanish dialects in Spain differentiate between the sound of \"z\" and \"c\" (before e and i), pronounced {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, and that of \"s\", pronounced {{IPA|/s/}}.

Phoenician colonization brought the cults of [[Baal]] and [[Melqart]]; the latter lasted into Roman times as [[Hercules]], mythical founder of both C\u00e1diz and Seville. The [[Islote de Sancti Petri]] held the supposed tomb of Hercules, with representations of his [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve labors]]; the region was the traditional site of the tenth labor, obtaining the cattle of the monster [[Geryon]]. Traditionally, the [[Pillars of Hercules]] flank the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. Clearly, the European pillar is the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]; the African pillar was presumably either [[Monte Hacho]] in [[Ceuta]] or [[Jebel Musa, Morocco|Jebel Musa]] in [[Morocco]]. The [[Roman road]] that led from C\u00e1diz to Rome was known by several names, one of them being ''[[Via Herculea]]'', Hercules route returning from his tenth labor. The present [[coat of arms of Andalusia]] shows Hercules between two lions, with two pillars behind these figures.\n\n[[Roman Catholicism]] is, by far, the largest religion in Andalusia.

Among the most famous of these are the [[Seville Fair]] or ''Feria de Abril'' in Seville, now echoed by smaller fairs in Madrid and Barcelona, both of which have many Andalusian immigrants; the ''[[Feria de Agosto]]'' in M\u00e1laga; the [[Feria de Jerez]] or ''Feria del Caballo'' in Jerez; the Festival of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] in Granada; the [[Feria de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Salud]] in C\u00f3rdoba; the [[Columbian Festivals]] (''Fiestas Colombinas'') in Huelva; the [[Feria de la Virgen del Mar]] in [[Almer\u00eda]]; and the [[Feria de San Lucas (Ja\u00e9n)|Feria de San Lucas]] in Ja\u00e9n, among many others.\n\nFestivals of a religious nature are a deep Andalusian tradition and are met with great popular fervor. There are numerous major festivals during [[Holy Week]].

He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader (1 Sam. 30:7). When David ascended the throne of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], Abiathar was appointed High Priest (1 Chr. 15:11; 1 Kings 2:26) and the \"king's counselor\" (1 Chr. 27:33-34). Meanwhile, Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made High Priest. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia Abiathar was deposed from office when he was deserted by the Holy Spirit without which the [[Urim]] and Thummin could not be consulted.<ref>[https://archive.is/20071113024537/http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view_page.jsp?artid=265&letter=A&pid=0 ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' p.56]</ref> Another version says he was Co-Pontiff with Zadok during King David. He supported Prince Adonijah over Prince [[Solomon]], and was deposed by him and exiled in [[Anathoth]].\n\nThese appointments continued in force till the end of David's reign (1 Kings 4:4). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by [[Solomon]], because he took part in the attempt to raise [[Adonijah]] to the throne.

The language variety in the southern districts of Azad Kashmir is known by a variety of names \u2013 including ''Mirpuri'', ''Pothwari'' and ''Pahari'' \u2013 and is closely related to the Pothwari proper spoken to the east in the [[Pothohar Plateau|Pothohar region]] of Punjab. The dialect(s) of the central districts are occasionally referred to in the literature as ''Chibhali'' or ''Punchi'', but the speakers themselves usually call them ''Pahari'', an unfortunately ambiguous name that is also used for [[Pahari language (name)|several unrelated languages]] of the Lower Himalayas. Going north, the speech forms gradually change into Hindko. Already in [[Muzaffarabad District]] the preferred local name for the language is ''Hindko'', although it is still apparently more closely related to the core dialects of Pahari.<ref>The preceding paragraph is mostly based on {{harvtxt|Lothers|Lothers|2010}}. For further references, see the bibliograghy in [[Pahari-Pothwari]].</ref> Further north in the [[Neelam Valley]], the dialect, locally known as ''Parmi'', is more unambiguously subsumed under Hindko.{{sfn|Akhtar|Rehman|2007|p=68|ps = . The conclusion is based on lexical similarity and the comparison is with the Hindko of the [[Kaghan Valley]] and with the Pahari of the Murre Hills.}}\n\nAnother major language of Azad Kashmir is [[Gujari language|Gujari]]. It is spoken by several hundred thousand<ref group=\"note\">{{harvtxt|Hallberg|O'Leary|1992|p=96}} report two rough estimates for the total population of Gujari speakes in Azad Kashmir: 200,000 and 700,000, both from the 1980s.</ref> people among the traditionally nomadic [[Gujars]], many of whom are nowadays settled. Not all ethnic Gujars speak Gujari, the proportion of those who have shifted to other languages is probably higher in southern Azad Kashmir.{{sfn|Hallberg|O'Leary|1992|pp=96, 98, 100}} Gujari is most closely related to the [[Rajasthani languages]] (particularly [[Mewati language|Mewati]]), although it also shares features with Punjabi.{{sfn|Hallberg|O'Leary|1992|pp=93\u201394}} It is dispersed over large areas in northern Pakistan and India. Within Pakistan, the Gujari dialects of Azad Kashmir are more similar, in terms of shared basic vocabulary and mutual intelligibility, to the Gujar varieties of the neighbouring [[Hazara region]] than to the dialects spoken further to the northwest in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and north in [[Gilgit District|Gilgit]].{{sfn|Hallberg|O'Leary|1992|pp=111\u201312, 126}}\n\nThere are scattered communities of [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] speakers,<ref>{{harvnb|Rahman|2002|p=449}}; {{harvnb|Rahman|1996|p=226}}</ref> notably in the [[Neelam Valley]], where they form the second-largest language group after speakers of Hindko.{{sfn|Akhtar|Rehman|2007|p=70}} There have been calls for the teaching of Kashmiri (particularly in order to counter India's claim of promoting the culture of Kashmir), but the limited attempts at introducing the language at the secondary school level have not been successful, and it is Urdu, rather than Kashmiri, that Kashmiri Muslims have seen as their identity symbol.<ref>{{harvnb|Rahman|1996|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Rahman|2002|pp=449\u201350}}. The discussion in both cases is in the broader context of Pakistan.</ref> There is an ongoing process of gradual [[language shift|shift]] to larger local languages,{{sfn|Rahman|1996|p=226}} but at least in the Neelam Valley there still exist communities for whom Kashmiri is the sole mother tongue.{{sfn|Akhtar|Rehman|2007|pp=70, 75}}\n\nIn the northernmost [[Neelam Valley#Languages|district of Neelam]] there are pockets of other languages: [[Shina language|Shina]], with two distinct varieties spoken in three villages, [[Pashto]], the language of two villages on the Line of Control, and the endangered [[Kundal Shahi language|Kundal Shahi]], spoken by some of the inhabitants of the eponymous village and the only language not found outside Azad Kashmir.{{sfn|Akhtar|Rehman|2007}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of Azad Kashmir}}\n[[File:Sharda Kashmir.jpg|thumb|Neelum valley is a popular tourist destination in Azad Kashmir.]]\nHistorically the economy of Azad Kashmir has been agricultural which meant that land was the main source or mean of production. This means that all food for immediate and long term consumption was produced from land. The produce included various crops, fruits, vegetables etc. Land was also the source of other livelihood necessities such as wood, fuel, grazing for animals which then turned into dairy products.

There are mineral and marble resources in Azad Kashmir close to [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Muzaffarabad]]. There are also graphite deposits at Mohriwali. There are also reservoirs of low-grade coal, [[chalk]], [[bauxite]], and [[zircon]].

By the time of [[Julius Caesar]], several well-established combined land-sea trade routes depended upon [[water transport]] through the Sea around the rough inland [[terrain feature]]s to its north.\n[[File:Periplous of the Erythraean Sea.svg|left|thumb|Names, routes and locations of the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'']]\nThese routes usually began in the [[Far East]] or down river from [[Madhya Pradesh]] with [[transshipment]] via historic [[Bharuch]] (Bharakuccha), traversed past the inhospitable coast of today's [[Iran]] then split around [[Hadhramaut]] into two streams north into the [[Gulf of Aden]] and thence into the [[Levant]], or south into [[Alexandria]] via [[Red Sea]] ports such as [[Axum]]. Each major route involved transhipping to pack animal caravan, travel through desert country and risk of bandits and extortionate tolls by local potentates.\n\nThis southern coastal route past the rough country in the southern [[Arabian Peninsula]] ([[Yemen]] and [[Oman]] today) was significant, and the [[Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]]s built several shallow canals to service the trade, one more or less along the route of today's [[Suez canal]], and another from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Nile River]], both shallow works that were swallowed up by huge [[sand storm]]s in antiquity. Later the [[kingdom of Axum]] arose in [[Ethiopia]] to rule a mercantile empire rooted in the trade with Europe via Alexandria.\n\n===Major ports===\n[[File:Container terminal.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Kochi Port]] located on the south-west coast of India is the nearest Indian port to the international shipping routes, as well as one of the largest and busiest ports serving the Arabian Sea.

The port is located on the eastern bay of a natural hammerhead-shaped peninsula jutting out into the Arabian Sea from the coastline.\n\n[[Port of Salalah]] in [[Salalah]], [[Oman]] is also a major port in the area. The International Task Force often uses the port as a base. There is a significant number of warships of all nations coming in and out of the port, which makes it a very safe bubble.

As with methanol and phenylalanine, intake of aspartic acid from aspartame is less than would be expected from other dietary sources. At the 90th percentile of intake, aspartame provides only between 1% and 2% of the daily intake of aspartic acid.

However, clinical studies have shown no signs of neurotoxic effects,<ref name=Magnuson/> and studies of metabolism suggest it is not possible to ingest enough aspartic acid and glutamate through food and drink to levels that would be expected to be toxic.<ref name=Butchko/>\n\n====Methanol====\n\nThe [[methanol]] produced by the metabolism of aspartame is absorbed and quickly converted into [[formaldehyde]] and then completely oxidized to [[formic acid]]. The methanol from aspartame is unlikely to be a safety concern for several reasons.  Fruit juices and citrus fruits contain methanol, and there are other dietary sources for methanol such as [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] beverages and the amount of methanol produced from aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages is likely to be less than that from these and other sources that are already in people's diets.<ref name=Magnuson/> With regard to formaldehyde, it is rapidly converted in the body, and the amounts of formaldehyde from the metabolism of aspartame are trivial when compared to the amounts produced routinely by the human body and from other foods and drugs. At the highest expected human doses of consumption of aspartame, there are no increased blood levels of methanol or formic acid,<ref name=Magnuson/> and ingesting aspartame at the 90th percentile of intake would produce 25 times less methanol than what would be considered toxic.<ref name=Butchko/>\n\n==Chemistry==\n\nAspartame is a [[Methyl group|methyl]] [[ester]] of the [[dipeptide]] of the natural [[amino acid]]s <small>L</small>-[[aspartic acid]] and <small>L</small>-[[phenylalanine]].

In the chemical synthesis, the two carboxyl groups of aspartic acid are joined into an anhydride, and the amino group is [[protective group|protected]] by converting it to a functional group{{clarify|date=August 2016}} that will not interfere in the next reaction. Phenylalanine is converted to its methyl ester and combined with the ''N''-protected aspartic anhydride; then the protecting group is removed from aspartic nitrogen by acid hydrolysis. The drawback of this technique is that a byproduct, the bitter-tasting \u03b2-form, is produced when the wrong carboxyl group from aspartic acid links to phenylalanine. A process using an [[Thermolysin|enzyme from ''Bacillus thermoproteolyticus'']] to catalyze the condensation of the chemically altered amino acids will produce high yields without the \u03b2-form byproduct. A variant of this method, which has not been used commercially, uses unmodified aspartic acid, but produces low yields.

The AutoCAD command set is localized as a part of the software localization.\n\n=== Extensions ===\nAutoCAD supports a number of [[application program interface|API]]s for customization and automation. These include [[AutoLISP]], [[Visual LISP]], [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]], [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] and [[ObjectARX]]. ObjectARX is a [[C++]] class library, which was also the base for:\n* products extending AutoCAD functionality to specific fields\n* creating products such as [[AutoCAD Architecture]], AutoCAD Electrical, AutoCAD Civil 3D\n* third-party AutoCAD-based application\nThere are a large number of AutoCAD plugins (add-on applications) available on the application store Autodesk Exchange Apps\n.<ref>{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Exchange Apps|url=http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref>\nAutoCAD's [[DXF]], drawing exchange format, allows importing and exporting drawing information.\n\n=== Vertical integration ===\nAutodesk has also developed a few vertical programs:\n\n* AutoCAD Advance Steel\n* [[AutoCAD Architecture]]\n* AutoCAD Civil \n* AutoCAD Electrical\n* AutoCAD ecscad\n* AutoCAD Map 3D\n* AutoCAD Mech\n* AutoCAD MEP\n* AutoCAD Structural Detailing\n* AutoCAD Utility Design\n* AutoCAD P&ID\n* AutoCAD Plant 3D\n\nfor discipline-specific enhancements.\n\nFor example, [[AutoCAD Architecture]] (formerly Architectural Desktop) permits architectural designers to draw 3D objects, such as walls, doors, and windows, with more intelligent data associated with them rather than simple objects, such as lines and circles. The data can be programmed to represent specific architectural products sold in the construction industry, or extracted into a data file for pricing, materials estimation, and other values related to the objects represented.\n\nAdditional tools generate standard 2D drawings, such as elevations and sections, from a 3D architectural model. Similarly, Civil Design, Civil Design 3D, and Civil Design Professional support data-specific objects facilitating easy standard civil engineering calculations and representations.\n\nCivil 3D was originally developed as an AutoCAD add-on by a company in New Hampshire called Softdesk (originally DCA).  Softdesk was acquired by Autodesk, and Civil 3D was further evolved.\n\n== Variants ==\n=== AutoCAD Architecture ===\n{{Main article|AutoCAD Architecture}}\nAutoCAD Architecture (abbreviated as ACA) is a version of AutoCAD with tools and functions specially suited to [[Architecture|architectural]] work.\n\n=== AutoCAD LT ===\nAutoCAD LT is the lower cost version of AutoCAD, with reduced capabilities, first released in November 1993. Autodesk developed AutoCAD LT to have an entry-level CAD package to compete in the lower price level. Priced at $495, it became the first AutoCAD product priced below $1000. It was sold directly by Autodesk and in computer stores unlike the full version of AutoCAD, which must be purchased from official Autodesk dealers. AutoCAD LT 2015 introduced Desktop Subscription from $360 per year; as of 2018, three subscription plans were available, from $50 a month to a 3-year, $1170 license.\n\nWhile there are hundreds of small differences between the full AutoCAD package and AutoCAD LT, there are a few recognized major differences<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/autocad_lt_2011_faq.pdf |format=PDF |title=Questions and Answers |website=Images.autodesk.com |accessdate=2016-03-30}}</ref> in the software's features:\n\n* 3D Capabilities: AutoCAD LT lacks the ability to create, visualize and render 3D models as well as 3D printing.\n* Network Licensing: AutoCAD LT cannot be used on multiple machines over a network.\n* Customization: AutoCAD LT does not support customization with LISP, ARX, .NET and VBA.\n* Management and automation capabilities with Sheet Set Manager and Action Recorder.\n* CAD standards management tools.\n\n=== AutoCAD 360 ===\nFormerly marketed as AutoCAD WS, AutoCAD 360 is an account-based mobile and web application enabling registered users to view, edit, and share AutoCAD files via mobile device and web<ref name=iTgunes>{{cite web|last=Autodesk|title=AutoCAD WS|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autocad-ws/id393149734?mt=8|work=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple|accessdate=30 September 2011}}</ref> using a limited AutoCAD feature set &mdash; and using cloud-stored drawing files.  The program, which is an evolution and combination of previous products, uses a [[freemium]] business model with a free plan and two paid levels &mdash; marketed as Pro ($4.99 monthly or $49.99 yearly) and Pro Plus ($99.99 yearly) &mdash; including various amounts of storage, tools, and online access to drawings. 360 includes new features such as a \"Smart Pen\" mode and linking to third-party cloud-based storage such as [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]. Having evolved from Flash-based software, AutoCAD 360 uses [[HTML5]] browser technology available in newer browsers including Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nAutoCAD WS began with a version for the [[iPhone]] and subsequently expanded to include versions for the [[iPod Touch]], [[iPad]], Android phones, and Android tablets.<ref name=OzlerMaciPadiPhone>{{cite web|last=Ozler|first=Levent|title=AutoCAD for Mac and AutoCAD WS application for iPad and iPhone|url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/21266|work=Dexigner|publisher=Dexigner|accessdate=30 September 2011}}</ref> Autodesk released the [[iOS]] version in September 2010,<ref name=OzlerBuiltForMac>{{cite web|last=Ozler|first=Levent|title=AutoCAD for Mac 2012: Built for Mac OS X Lion|url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/23640|work=Dexigner|publisher=Dexigner|accessdate=30 September 2011}}</ref> following with the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version on April 20, 2011.<ref name=OzlerWSAndroid>{{cite web|last=Ozler|first=Levent|title=AutoCAD WS for Android|url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/22874|work=Dexigner|publisher=Dexigner|accessdate=30 September 2011}}</ref> The program is available via download at no cost from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] ([[iOS]]), [[Google Play]] ([[Android (operating system)|Android]]) and [[Amazon Appstore]] (Android).\n\nIn its initial iOS version, AutoCAD WS supported drawing of lines, circles, and other shapes; creation of text and comment boxes; and management of color, layer, and measurements &mdash; in both landscape and portrait modes. Version 1.3, released August 17, 2011, added support for unit typing, layer visibility, area measurement and file management.<ref name=\"iTgunes\" /> The Android variant includes the iOS feature set along with such unique features as the ability to insert text or captions by voice command as well as manually.<ref name=OzlerWSAndroid/> Both Android and iOS versions allow the user to save files on-line &mdash; or off-line in the absence of an Internet connection.<ref name=OzlerWSAndroid/>\n\nIn 2011, Autodesk announced plans to migrate the majority of its software to \"[[cloud computing|the cloud]]\", starting with the AutoCAD WS mobile application.<ref name=Cloud>{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=Iain|title=Autodesk Shifts Design Apps to the Cloud|url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/23929|work=The A Register|publisher=The A Register|accessdate=30 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2013 interview with Ilai Rotbaein, an AutoCAD WS [[Application software|Product]] Manager for Autodesk, the name '''''AutoCAD WS''''' had no definitive meaning, and was interpreted variously as ''Autodesk Web Service'', ''White Sheet'' or ''Work Space.''<ref name=forward>{{cite web\n|title=AutoCAD WS: Moving Forward\n|url=http://www.augi.com/library/autocad-ws-moving-forward\n|publisher=Augi Autodesk Users Group International, January 29th, 2013\n|accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Student versions ===\nAutoCAD is licensed, for free, to students, educators, and educational institutions, with a 36-month renewable license available. The student version of AutoCAD is functionally identical to the full commercial version, with one exception: DWG files created or edited by a student version have an internal bit-flag set (the \"educational flag\"). When such a DWG file is printed by any version of AutoCAD (commercial or student) older than AutoCAD 2014 SP1, the output includes a plot stamp/banner on all four sides. Objects created in the Student Version cannot be used for commercial use. Student Version objects \"infect\" a commercial version DWG file if they are imported in versions older than AutoCAD 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2011/ENU/filesAUG/WS1a9193826455f5ffa23ce210c4a30acaf-6050.htm|title=Overview of Plotting|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Ports ==\n\n===  Windows ===\nAutoCAD is a software package created for Windows and usually, any new AutoCAD version supports the current Windows version and some older ones.

Because of this, correct imports of DXF files have been difficult. Autodesk now publishes the DXF specifications as a PDF<ref name=acad_dxf0.pdf /> on its website.\n\nVersions of AutoCAD from Release 10 (October 1988) and up support both [[ASCII]] and [[binary file|binary]] forms of DXF.  Earlier versions support only ASCII.\n\nAs AutoCAD has become more powerful, supporting more complex object types, DXF has become less useful. Certain object types, including [[ACIS]] solids and regions, are not documented. Other object types, including AutoCAD 2006's dynamic blocks, and all of the objects specific to the [[vertical market]] versions of AutoCAD, are partially documented, but not well enough to allow other developers to support them. For these reasons many CAD applications use the [[.dwg|DWG]] format which can be licensed from [[Autodesk]] or non-natively from the [[Open Design Alliance]].\n\nDXF coordinates are always without dimensions so that the reader or user needs to know the drawing unit or has to extract it from the textual comments in the sheets.\n\n== File structure ==\nASCII versions of DXF can be read with any [[text editor]]. The basic organization of a DXF file is as follows:<ref>[http://www.autodesk.com/techpubs/autocad/acadr14/dxf/dxf_file_structure_al_u05_b.htm DXF File Structure]</ref>\n\n* '''HEADER''' section \u2013 General information about the drawing. Each parameter has a variable name and an associated value.\n* '''CLASSES''' section \u2013 Holds the information for application-defined classes whose instances appear in the BLOCKS, ENTITIES, and OBJECTS sections of the database. Generally does not provide sufficient information to allow interoperability with other programs.\n* '''TABLES''' section \u2013 This section contains definitions of named items.\n: Application ID (APPID) table\n: Block Record (BLOCK_RECORD) table\n: Dimension Style (DIMSTYLE) table\n: Layer (LAYER) table\n: Linetype (LTYPE) table\n: Text style (STYLE) table\n: User Coordinate System (UCS) table\n: View (VIEW) table\n: Viewport configuration (VPORT) table\n* '''BLOCKS''' section \u2013 This section contains Block Definition entities describing the entities comprising each Block in the drawing.\n* '''ENTITIES''' section \u2013 This section contains the drawing entities, including any Block References.\n* '''OBJECTS''' section \u2013 Contains the data that apply to nongraphical objects, used by AutoLISP and ObjectARX applications.\n* '''THUMBNAILIMAGE''' section \u2013 Contains the preview image for the DXF file.\n* '''END OF FILE'''\n\nThe data format of a DXF is called a \"tagged data\" format which \"means that each data element in the file is preceded by an integer number that is called a group code. A group code's value indicates what type of data element follows. This value also indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object (or record) type. Virtually all user-specified information in a drawing file can be represented in DXF format.\"<ref>\"Chapter 1 -- DXF Format\" [http://www.autodesk.com/techpubs/autocad/acad2000/dxf/dxf_format.htm Autodesk.com]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[.dwg]] (DWG)\n* [[Design Web Format]] (DWF)\n* [[QCad]], an open source CAD application that uses the DXF file format internally and to save and import files\n** [[LibreCAD]], a version of QCAD Community Edition ported to Qt4\n* [[Open Design Alliance]] (originally called OpenDWG)\n* [[ShareCAD]], a free online CAD viewer that supports DXF, among other formats\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?id=24240325&siteID=123112 DXF Reference from Autodesk Developer Network].

Only [[prokaryote]]s (the [[archaea]] and the [[bacteria]]) reproduce asexually through binary fission. [[Eukaryote]]s (such as [[protist]]s and unicellular [[fungi]]) may reproduce in a functionally similar manner by [[mitosis]]; most of these are also capable of sexual reproduction.\n\nMultiple fission at the cellular level occurs in many [[protist]]s, e.g. [[sporozoa]]ns and [[algae]]. The [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the parent cell divides several times by [[mitosis]], producing several nuclei. The cytoplasm then separates, creating multiple daughter cells.<ref name=\"ebrit\">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498542/reproduction/76146/Multiple-fission |title=Cell reproduction |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref><ref name=\"fap\">{{cite book |author=Britannica Educational Publishing |title=Fungi, Algae, and Protists |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-61530-463-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_U9MB4iUpDIC&lpg=PA102&dq=multiple%20fission&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q=multiple%20fission&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"aff\">{{cite book |author=P.Puranik |author2=Asha Bhate |title=Animal Forms And Functions: Invertebrata |publisher=Sarup & Sons |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-7625-791-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-kdq6RyyVE0C&lpg=PA87&dq=multiple%20fission&pg=PA87#v=onepage&q=multiple%20fission&f=false}}</ref>\n\nIn [[apicomplexa]]ns, multiple fission, or [[schizogony]] appears either as [[protozoal merogony|merogony]], [[sporogony]] or [[gametogony]].

The offspring organism is smaller than the parent. Budding is also known on a multicellular level; an animal example is the [[Hydra (genus) |hydra]], which reproduces by budding. The buds grow into fully matured individuals which eventually break away from the parent organism. \n\nInternal budding is a process of asexual reproduction, favoured by parasites such as ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''. It involves an unusual process in which two (''endodyogeny'') or more (''endopolygeny'') daughter cells are produced inside a mother cell, which is then consumed by the offspring prior to their separation.<ref name=smyth>{{cite book |author1=Smyth, James Desmond |author2=Wakelin, Derek |title=Introduction to animal parasitology |year=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=101\u2013102 |edition=3 |isbn=0-521-42811-4 }}</ref>\n\nAlso, budding (external or internal) is present in some worm like [[Taenia (genus) |Taenia]] or [[Echinococcus |Echinococci]]; these worm produce cyst and then produce (invaginated or evaginated) [[protoscolex]] with [[budding]].\n\n=== Vegetative propagation===\n{{main|Vegetative propagation}}\n[[File:Bryophyllum daigremontianum nahaufnahme1.jpg|thumb|Vegetative plantlets of mother-of-thousands, ''[[Bryophyllum daigremontianum|Bryophyllum (Kalanchoe) daigremontianum]]'']]\n\nVegetative propagation is a type of asexual reproduction found in plants where new individuals are formed without the production of seeds or spores by [[meiosis]] or [[syngamy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss6/asexual.html |title=Asexual Reproduction |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref> Examples of vegetative reproduction include the formation of miniaturized plants called plantlets on specialized leaves (for example in [[kalanchoe]]) and some produce new plants out of [[rhizome]]s or [[stolon]] (for example in [[Garden strawberry |strawberry]]).

Exceptions are animals and some protists, who undergo ''meiosis'' immediately followed by fertilization. Plants and many algae on the other hand undergo ''sporic meiosis'' where meiosis leads to the formation of [[haploid]] spores rather than gametes. These spores grow into multicellular individuals (called [[gametophyte]]s in the case of plants) without a fertilization event. These haploid individuals give rise to [[gamete]]s through [[mitosis]]. Meiosis and gamete formation therefore occur in separate generations or \"phases\" of the life cycle, referred to as [[alternation of generations]]. Since sexual reproduction is often more narrowly defined as the fusion of gametes ([[fertilization]]), spore formation in plant [[sporophyte]]s and algae might be considered a form of asexual reproduction (agamogenesis) despite being the result of [[meiosis]] and undergoing a reduction in [[ploidy]]. However, both events (spore formation and fertilization) are necessary to complete sexual reproduction in the plant life cycle.\n\nFungi and some algae can also utilize true asexual [[spore]] formation, which involves [[mitosis]] giving rise to reproductive cells called mitospores that develop into a new organism after dispersal. This method of reproduction is found for example in [[Conidium |conidial fungi]] and the [[red algae]] ''Polysiphonia'', and involves sporogenesis without meiosis. Thus the chromosome number of the spore cell is the same as that of the parent producing the spores. However, mitotic sporogenesis is an exception and most spores, such as those of plants, most [[Basidiomycota]], and many algae, are produced by [[meiosis]].\n\n=== Fragmentation===\n[[File:Tu - Linckia guildingi.jpg |thumb |right |alt=Regeneration from an arm |''[[Linckia guildingi]]'' \"comet\", a [[starfish]] regrowing from a single arm]]\n{{main|Fragmentation (reproduction)}}\n\nFragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent.

These fragments can take the form of ''soredia'', dust-like particles consisting of fungal hyphen wrapped around photobiont cells.\n\nClonal Fragmentation in multicellular or colonial organisms is a form of asexual reproduction or cloning where an organism is split into fragments.

Examples are [[parthenogenesis]] and [[apomixis]].\n\n==== Parthenogenesis====\n[[File:Aphid-giving-birth.jpg |thumb |[[Aphid]] giving birth to live young from an unfertilized egg]]\n{{main|Parthenogenesis}}\n\nParthenogenesis is a form of [[agamogenesis]] in which an unfertilized egg develops into a new individual. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in many plants, [[invertebrate]]s (e.g. water fleas, [[rotifer]]s, aphids, [[stick insect]]s, some ants, bees and parasitic wasps), and [[vertebrate]]s (e.g. some reptiles, amphibians, rarely birds). In plants, [[apomixis]] may or may not involve parthenogenesis.\n\n==== Apomixis and nucellar embryony====\n{{main|Apomixis |Nucellar embryony}}\n\nApomixis in plants is the formation of a new [[sporophyte]] without fertilization. It is important in ferns and in flowering plants, but is very rare in other seed plants. In flowering plants, the term \"apomixis\" is now most often used for [[agamospermy]], the formation of seeds without fertilization, but was once used to include [[vegetative reproduction]]. An example of an [[apomictic]] plant would be the [[triploid]] European [[dandelion]]. Apomixis mainly occurs in two forms: In gametophytic apomixis, the embryo arises from an unfertilized egg within a diploid embryo sac that was formed without completing meiosis. In [[nucellar embryony]], the embryo is formed from the diploid [[nucellus]] tissue surrounding the embryo sac. Nucellar embryony occurs in some [[citrus]] seeds. Male apomixis can occur in rare cases, such as the Saharan Cypress ''[[Cupressus dupreziana]]'', where the genetic material of the embryo are derived entirely from [[pollen]].\n\n== Alternation between sexual and asexual reproduction==\n{{see also |Plant reproduction#Sexual reproduction}}\n[[File:Soybeanaphidlifecycle.gif|thumb|upright=1.7|[[Aphid]] populations are often entirely female during the summer, with sexual reproduction only to produce eggs for overwintering.]]\n\nSome species alternate between sexual and asexual strategies, an ability known as '''[[heterogamy]]''', depending on conditions. Alternation is observed in several [[rotifer]] species (cyclical parthenogenesis e.g. in [[Brachionus]] species) and a few types of insects, such as [[aphid]]s which will, under certain conditions, produce eggs that have not gone through meiosis, thus cloning themselves. The cape bee [[Apis mellifera capensis |''Apis mellifera'' subsp. ''capensis'']] can reproduce asexually through a process called [[thelytoky]]. A few species of amphibians, reptiles , and birds have a similar ability.For example, the freshwater crustacean ''[[Daphnia]]'' reproduces by parthenogenesis in the spring to rapidly populate ponds, then switches to [[sexual reproduction]] as the intensity of competition and predation increases. Another example are monogonont [[rotifer]]s of the genus ''[[Brachionus]]'', which reproduce via cyclical parthenogenesis: at low population densities females produce asexually and at higher densities a chemical cue accumulates and induces the transition to sexual reproduction. Many protists and fungi alternate between sexual and asexual reproduction.\n\nFor example, the slime mold ''[[Dictyostelium]]'' undergoes binary fission (mitosis) as single-celled amoebae under favorable conditions. However, when conditions turn unfavorable, the cells aggregate and follow one of two different developmental pathways, depending on conditions. In the social pathway, they form a multicellular slug which then forms a fruiting body with asexually generated spores. In the sexual pathway, two cells fuse to form a giant cell that develops into a large cyst. When this macrocyst germinates, it releases hundreds of amoebic cells that are the product of meiotic recombination between the original two cells.<ref name=\"MehrotraAneja1990\">{{cite book |author1=Mehrotra, R.

Within animals, this phenomenon has been best studied in the parasitic [[Hymenoptera]]. In the [[9-banded armadillos]], this process is obligatory and usually gives rise to genetically identical quadruplets. In other mammals, [[monozygotic twinning]] has no apparent genetic basis, though its occurrence is common.

Known as the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] equivalent of [[Claude Lorrain]], this [[landscape art]]ist went on to inherit a considerable fortune. His family were all artists, with his uncle [[Benjamin Gerritsz Cuyp|Benjamin]] and grandfather [[Gerrit Gerritsz Cuyp|Gerrit]] being [[stained glass]] cartoon designers. Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp, his father, was a [[portraitist]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Aelbert Cuyp |work = The Vincent van Gogh Gallery |url = http://www.vangoghgallery.com/artistbios/Aelbert_Cuyp.html |accessdate = 2007-04-14 }}</ref>\n\nThe amount of biographical information regarding Aelbert Cuyp is tremendously limited. Even Arnold Houbraken, a noted historian of Dutch Golden Age paintings and the sole authority on Cuyp for the hundred years following his death, paints a very thin biographical picture.<ref>Wheelock, Arthur K., Jr., Aelbert Cuyp, (2001), p. 16.</ref> His period of activity as a painter is traditionally limited to the two decades between 1639 and 1660, fitting directly within the generally accepted limits of the Dutch Golden Age's most significant period, 1640-1665. He is known to have been married to Cornelia Bosman in 1658, a date coinciding so directly with the end of his productivity as a painter that it has been accepted that his marriage played some sort of role in the end of his artistic career.<ref>[[#Reiss|Reiss (1975)]], p. 7.</ref> The year after his marriage Cuyp became the deacon of the reformed church. Even Houbraken recalled that Cuyp was a devout Calvinist and the fact that when he died, there were no paintings of other artists found in his home.<ref>Arnold Houbraken, De groote schouburgh der nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen, (1718-1721), p.198.</ref>\n\n== Style ==\n[[Image:Aelbert Cuyp - The Maas at Dordrecht - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.54|''The Maas at Dordrecht'', circa 1650, showing the [[Meuse|Maas River]] in front of Cuyp's hometown of Dordrecht, [[National Gallery of Art]].]]\n[[File:Aelbert Cuyp - Piping Shepherds (Metropolitan Museum of Art).jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.54|Aelbert Cuyp - ''Piping Shepherds'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art)]]\nThe development of Aelbert Cuyp, who was trained as a landscape painter, may be roughly sketched in three phases based on the painters who most influenced him during that time and the subsequent artistic characteristics that are apparent in his paintings. Generally, Cuyp learned tone from the exceptionally prolific [[Jan van Goyen]], light from [[Jan Both]] and form from his father, Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp.<ref name=\"Reiss_8\">[[#Reiss|Reiss (1975)]], p. 8.</ref>\n\nCuyp's \"van Goyen phase\" can be placed approximately in the early 1640s.\nCuyp probably first encountered a painting by van Goyen in 1640 when van Goyen was, as Stephen Reiss points out \"at the height of [his] powers.\"<ref name=\"Reiss_8\"/> This is noticeable in the comparison between two of Cuyp's landscape paintings inscribed 1639 where no properly formed style is apparent and the landscape backgrounds he painted two years later for two of his father's group portraits that are distinctly van Goyenesque. \nCuyp took from van Goyen the straw yellow and light brown tones that are so apparent in his Dunes (1629) and the broken brush technique also very noticeable in that same work. \nThis technique, a precursor to impressionism, is noted for the short brush strokes where the colors are not necessarily blended smoothly. In Cuyp's River Scene, Two Men Conversing (1641) both of these van Goyen-influenced stylistic elements are noticeable\n\nThe next phase in the development of Cuyp's increasingly amalgamated style is due to the influence of Jan Both. In the mid-1640s Both, a native and resident of Utrecht, had just returned to his hometown from a trip to Rome. It is around this same time that Cuyp's style changed fundamentally. In Rome, Both had developed a new style of composition due, at least in part, to his interaction with Claude Lorrain. This new style was focused on changing the direction of light in the painting. Instead of the light being placed at right angles in relation to the line of vision, Both started moving it to a diagonal position from the back of the picture.<ref name=\"Reiss_8\"/> In this new form of lighting, the artist (and viewer of the painting) faced the sun more or less contre-jour. Both, and subsequently Cuyp, used the advantages of this new lighting style to alter the sense of depth and luminosity possible in a painting. To make notice of these new capabilities, much use was made of elongated shadows. Cuyp was one of the first Dutch painters to appreciate this new leap forward in style and while his own Both-inspired phase was quite short (limited to the mid-1640s) he did, more than any other contemporary Dutch artist, maximize the full chromatic scale for sunsets and sunrises.<ref name=\"Reiss_8\"/>\n\nCuyp's third stylistic phase (which occurred throughout his career) is based on the influence of his father. While it is assumed that the younger Cuyp did work with his father initially to develop rudimentary talents, Aelbert became more focused on landscape paintings while Jacob was a portrait painter by profession. As has been mentioned and as will be explained in depth below, there are pieces where Aelbert provided the landscape background for his father's portraits. What is meant by stating that Aelbert learned form from his father is that his eventual transition from a specifically landscape painter to the involvement of foreground figures is attributed to his interaction with his father Jacob. The evidence for Aelbert's evolution to foreground figure painter is in the production of some paintings from 1645-50 featuring foreground animals that do not fit with Jacob's style.<ref>[[#Reiss|Reiss (1975)]], p. 9.</ref> Adding to the confusion that is, Aelbert's stylistic development and the problem of attribution is of course the fact that Jacob's style was not stagnant either. Their converging styles make it difficult to exactly understand the influences each had on the other, although it is clear enough to say that Aelbert started representing large scale forms (something he had not done previously) and placing animals as the focus of his paintings (something that was specific to him).\n\n== Paintings ==\n[[File:Cuyp - Schafherde auf der Weide - St\u00e4del.jpg|thumb|''Herd of Sheep at Pasture'', 1650, [[St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut]]]]\nSunlight in his paintings rakes across the panel, accentuating small bits of detail in the golden light. In large, atmospheric panoramas of the countryside, the highlights on a blade of meadow grass, the mane of a tranquil horse, the horn of a dairy cow reclining by a stream, or the tip of a peasant's hat are all caught in a bath of yellow ocher light. The richly [[varnish]]ed medium refracts the rays of light like a jewel as it dissolves into numerous glazed layers. Cuyp's landscapes were based on reality and on his own invention of what an enchanting landscape should be.\n\nCuyp's drawings reveal him to be a [[drawing|draftsman]] of superior quality. Light-drenched washes of [[Walnut ink|golden brown ink]] depict a distant view of the city of [[Dordrecht]] or [[Utrecht]].\nA Cuyp drawing may look like he intended it to be a finished work of art, but it was most likely taken back to the studio and used as a reference for his paintings. Often the same section of a sketch can be found in several different pictures.\n\nCuyp signed many of his works but rarely dated them, so that a chronology of his career has not been satisfactorily reassembled. A phenomenal number of paintings are ascribed to him, some of which are likely to be by other masters of the golden landscape, such as [[Abraham Calraet]] (1642&ndash;1722), whose initials ''A.C.'' may be mistaken for Cuyp's.\n\nHowever, not everyone appreciates his work and ''River Landscape'' (1660), despite being widely regarded as amongst his best work, has been described as having \"[[Chocolate box art|chocolate box]] blandness\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kelly |first=Ned |title=Cuyp cake |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=2002-03-18 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200203180037 |accessdate=2007-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224211/http://www.newstatesman.com/200203180037 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Misattribution of paintings ==\n[[File:Cuyp, Aelbert - Cattle near a River - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Cattle near a River'', painting by an imitator of Cuyp (suspected 18th century).]]\n\nIn addition to the scarcely documented and confirmed biography of Cuyp's life, and even more so than his amalgamated style from his three main influences, there are yet other factors that have led to the misattribution and confusion over Aelbert Cuyp's works for hundreds of years. His highly influenced style which incorporated Italianate lighting from Jan Both, broken brush technique and atonality from Jan van Goyen, and his ever-developing style from his father Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp was studied acutely by his most prominent follower, Abraham van Calraet. Calraet mimicked Cuyp's style, incorporating the same aspects, and produced similar landscapes to that of the latter. This made it quite difficult to tell whose paintings where whose. Adding to the confusion is the similar initials between the two and the inconsistent signing of paintings which were produced by Cuyp's studio.\n\nAlthough Aelbert Cuyp signed many of his paintings with a script \"A. Cuyp\" insignia, many paintings were left unsigned (not to mention undated) after being painted, and so a similar signature was added later on, presumably by collectors who inherited or discovered the works. Furthermore, many possible Cuyp paintings were not signed but rather initialed \"A. C.\" referring to his name. However, Abraham van Calraet could also have used the same initials to denote a painting. Although this is unlikely (as Calraet would likely have signed his paintings \"A. v.C.\"), this brings up the question of how paintings were signed to show ownership. Most original Cuyp paintings were signed by him, and in the script manner in which his name was inscribed. This would denote that the painting was done almost entirely by him. Conversely, paintings which came out of his workshop that were not necessarily physically worked on by Cuyp but merely overseen by him technically, were marked with A.C. to show that it was his instruction which saw the paintings' completion. Cuyp's pupils and assistants often worked on paintings in his studio, and so most of the work of a painting could be done without Cuyp ever touching the canvas, but merely approving its finality. Hence, the initialed inscription rather than a signature.<ref>[[#Reiss|Reiss (1975)]], p. 10.</ref>\n\nCommon among the mislabeled works are all of the reasons identified for misattributing Cuyp's works: the lack of biography and chronology of his works made it difficult to discern when paintings were created (making it difficult to pinpoint an artist); contentious signatures added to historians' confusion as to who actually painted the works; and the collaborations and influences by different painters makes it hard to justify that a painting is genuinely that of Aelbert Cuyp; and finally, accurate identification is made extremely difficult by the fact that this same style was copied (rather accurately) by his predecessor. As it turns out, even the historians and expert researchers have been fooled and forced to reassess their conclusions over \"Cuyp's\" paintings over the years.\n\n==Later life==\nAfter he married Cornelia Boschman in 1658, the number of works produced by him declined almost to nothing. This may have been because his wife was a very religious woman and a not very big patron of the arts. It could also be that he became more active in the church under his wife's guidance. He was also active as deacon and elder of the Reformed Church.<ref>{{cite web |last =  |first =  |title = Aelbert Cuyp |work = [[National Gallery of Art]] |year = 2007 |url = http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2001/cuyp/life.htm |accessdate = 2007-10-25 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093145/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2001/cuyp/life.htm |archivedate = 2008-05-09 |df =  }}</ref>\n\n==Conclusions==\nUpon close examination of the works attributed to Aelbert Cuyp it is easily understood why his unique style developed the way it did, and how his works have been misinterpreted over the years. A lacking biography and weak chronology of works as well as his style which emerged from various influences makes his works distinctive, yet often questionable in determination. Furthermore, his evolving technique and collaborations with his father add to the puzzle over which works should be attributed to Cuyp. Lastly and most importantly, the precision in mimicking Cuyp's style by his follower Abraham van Calraet and their contentious signatures makes it all the more difficult to determine which paintings are genuinely that of Cuyp and which ones are actually accurate reproductions in his style.\n\nSuch a thin chronology and little background knowledge has led to gross misinterpretations of his works, and thus further investigation must always be done to conclude with confidence that Aelbert Cuyp is the genuine source of such great paintings. It is this felt reluctance which led the Rijksmuseum to reattribute works to other painters (Abraham van Calraet does not even appear in a Museum catalogue until 1926, and even then he is not given his own entry)<ref>Riemsdijk, (1926), p. 47.</ref> which shows how important it is to art historians that painters are accurately connected to their works\u2014and this is continuously necessary for those of Aelbert Cuyp, as Dordrecht's most famous painter may not in fact be Dordrecht's most famous painter.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=packed heights=154px mode=packed-hover caption=\" Aelbert Cuyp's paintings\">\nFile:Aelbert Cuyp - Landscape with cattle - Google Art Project.jpg|''Landscape with cattle''<br>(c. 1639-1649)<br>[[National Gallery of Victoria]].\nFile:Aelbert Cuyp (Dutch - A View of the Maas at Dordrecht - Google Art Project.jpg|''A View of the Maas at Dordrecht''<br>(about 1645-1646)<br>[[J.

This double bond is stronger than a single [[covalent bond]] (611&nbsp;[[joule|kJ]]/[[Mole (unit)|mol]] for C=C vs. 347&nbsp;kJ/mol for C\u2013C)<ref name=\"Wade\"/> and also shorter, with an average [[bond length]] of 1.33 [[\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m]]s (133 [[picometre|pm]]).\n\nEach carbon of the double bond uses its three sp<sup>2</sup> [[orbital hybridization|hybrid orbitals]] to form sigma bonds to three atoms (the other carbon and two hydrogen atoms). The unhybridized 2p atomic orbitals, which lie perpendicular to the plane created by the axes of the three sp\u00b2 hybrid orbitals, combine to form the pi bond. This bond lies outside the main C\u2013C axis, with half of the bond on one side of the molecule and half on the other.  With a strength of 65 kcal/mol, the pi bond is significantly weaker than the sigma bond.\n\nRotation about the carbon\u2013carbon double bond is restricted because it incurs an energetic cost to break the alignment of the [[p orbital]]s on the two carbon atoms. As a consequence, substituted alkenes may exist as one of two [[isomer]]s, called ''cis'' or ''trans'' isomers. More complex alkenes may be named with the [[E-Z notation|''E''\u2013''Z'' notation]] for molecules with three or four different [[substituent]]s (side groups). For example, of the [[Butene#Isomers|isomers of butene]], the two methyl groups of (''Z'')-but-2[[-ene]] (a.k.a. ''cis''-2-butene) appear on the same side of the double bond, and in (''E'')-but-2-ene (a.k.a. ''trans''-2-butene) the methyl groups appear on opposite sides. These two isomers of butene are slightly different in their chemical and physical properties.\n\nTwisting to a 90\u00b0 dihedral angle between two of the groups on the carbons requires less energy than the strength of a [[pi bond]], and the bond still holds. The carbons of the double bond become [[pyramidalization|pyramidal]], which allows preserving some [[p orbital]] alignment\u2014and hence pi bonding. The other two attached groups remain at a larger dihedral angle. This contradicts a common textbook assertion that the two carbons retain their planar nature when twisting, in which case the p orbitals would rotate enough away from each other to be unable to sustain a pi bond. In a 90\u00b0-twisted alkene, the p orbitals are only misaligned by 42\u00b0 and the strain energy is only around 40 kcal/mol.  In contrast, a fully broken pi bond has an energetic cost of around 65 kcal/mol.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last=Barrows|first=Susan E.|last2=Eberlein|first2=Thomas H.|year=2005|title=Understanding Rotation about a C=C Double Bond|url=http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2005/Sep/abs1329.html|journal=J.

For example, ''trans''-[[cyclooctene]] is a stable strained alkene and the orbital misalignment is only 19\u00b0, despite having a significant [[dihedral angle]] of 137\u00b0 (a planar system has a dihedral angle of 180\u00b0) and a degree of pyramidalization of 18\u00b0.

Most reactions of alkenes involve additions to this pi bond, forming new [[sigma bond|single bonds]].  Alkenes serve as a feedstock for the [[petrochemical industry]] because they can participate in a wide variety of reactions, prominently polymerization and alkylation.\n\n===Addition reactions===\nAlkenes react in many [[addition reaction]]s, which occur by opening up the double-bond. Most of these addition reactions follow the mechanism of [[electrophilic addition]]. Examples are [[hydrohalogenation]], [[halogenation]], [[halohydrin formation]], [[oxymercuration]], [[Hydroboration\u2013oxidation reaction|hydroboration]], [[dichlorocarbene addition]], [[Simmons\u2013Smith reaction]], [[catalytic hydrogenation]], [[epoxidation]], [[radical polymerization]] and [[hydroxylation]].\n:[[File:Ear.png|400px|alt=Electrophilic addition|Electrophilic addition of X\u2013Y to an alkene]]\n\n====Hydrogenation====\n[[Hydrogenation]] of alkenes produces the corresponding [[alkane]]s. The reaction is carried out under pressure at a temperature of 200&nbsp;\u00b0C in the presence of a metallic [[catalyst]]. Common industrial catalysts are based on [[platinum]], [[nickel]] or [[palladium]]. For laboratory syntheses, [[Raney nickel]] (an [[alloy]] of nickel and aluminium) is often employed. The simplest example of this reaction is the catalytic hydrogenation of [[ethylene]] to yield [[ethane]]:\n:CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>\n\n====Hydration====\n[[Hydration reaction|Hydration]], the addition of water across the double bond of alkenes, yields [[alcohol]]s. The reaction is catalyzed by strong [[acids]] such as [[sulfuric acid]]. This reaction is carried out on an industrial scale to produce [[ethanol]].\n\n:CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>OH\n\nAlkenes can also be converted into alcohols via the [[oxymercuration\u2013demercuration reaction]] , the [[hydroboration\u2013oxidation reaction]] or by [[Mukaiyama hydration]].\n\n====Halogenation====\nIn [[electrophilic halogenation]] the addition of elemental [[bromine]] or [[chlorine]] to alkenes yields [[vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] dibromo- and dichloroalkanes (1,2-dihalides or ethylene dihalides), respectively. The decoloration of a solution of bromine in water is an analytical test for the presence of alkenes:\n\n:CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> + Br<sub>2</sub> \u2192 BrCH<sub>2</sub>\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>Br\n\nRelated reactions are also used as quantitative measures of unsaturation, expressed as the [[bromine number]] and [[iodine number]] of a compound or mixture.\n\n====Hydrohalogenation====\n[[Hydrohalogenation]] is the addition of [[hydrogen halide]]s such as [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]] or [[hydrogen iodide|HI]] to alkenes to yield the corresponding [[haloalkane]]s:\n:CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013CH=CH<sub>2</sub> + HI \u2192 CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013CH'''I'''-CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013'''H'''\n\nIf the two carbon atoms at the double bond are linked to a different number of hydrogen atoms, the halogen is found preferentially at the carbon with fewer hydrogen substituents.  This patterns is known as [[Markovnikov's rule]]. The use of [[Free-radical addition|radical initiators]] or other compounds can lead to the opposite product result. [[Hydrobromic acid]] in particular is prone to forming radicals in the presence of various impurities or even atmospheric oxygen, leading to the reversal of the Markovnikov result:<ref>{{cite book |title= Introduction to Organic Chemistry |edition= 4th |first1= A. |last1= Streiwieser |authorlink1= Andrew Streitwieser |first2= C.H. |last2= Heathcock |authorlink2= Clayton Heathcock |first3= E.M. |last3= Kosower |publisher= Macmillan |location= New York |year= 1992 |chapter= 11.6.G.

In the presence of [[oxygen]], alkenes burn with a bright flame to produce [[carbon dioxide]] and water. [[Catalysis|Catalytic]] oxidation with oxygen or the reaction with [[Peroxy acid|percarboxylic acids]] yields [[epoxide]]s. Reaction with ozone in [[ozonolysis]] leads to the breaking of the double bond, yielding two [[aldehyde]]s or [[ketone]]s. Reaction with concentrated, hot [[potassium permanganate|KMnO<sub>4</sub>]] (or other oxidizing salts) in an acidic solution will yield [[ketone]]s or [[carboxylic acid]]s.\n\n:R<sup>1</sup>\u2013CH=CH\u2013R<sup>2</sup> + O<sub>3</sub> \u2192 R<sup>1</sup>\u2013CHO + R<sup>2</sup>\u2013CHO + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThis reaction can be used to determine the position of a double bond in an unknown alkene.\n\nThe oxidation can be stopped at the [[vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] [[diol]] rather than full cleavage of the alkene by using milder (dilute,lower temperature) KMnO<sub>4</sub> or with [[osmium tetroxide]] or other oxidants.\n\n==== Photooxygenation ====\nIn the presence of an appropriate [[photosensitiser]], such as [[methylene blue]] and light, alkenes can undergo reactions with reactive oxygen species generated by the photosensitiser, such as [[hydroxyl radical]]s, [[singlet oxygen]] or [[superoxide]] ion. These reactive [[photochemical]] intermediates are generated in what are known as Type I, Type II, and Type III processes, respectively.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} These various alternative processes and reactions can be controlled by choice of specific reaction conditions, leading to a wide range of different products. A common example is the [4+2]-[[cycloaddition]] of singlet oxygen with a [[diene]] such as [[cyclopentadiene]] to yield an [[endoperoxide]]:\n\n[[File:4+2 cycloaddition cyclopentadiene O2.svg|350px|center|alt=Generation of singlet oxygen and its [4+2]-cycloaddition with cyclopentadiene]]\n\nAnother example is the [[Ene reaction#Singlet-oxygen ene reaction|Schenck ene reaction]], in which singlet oxygen reacts with an [[allyl]]ic structure to give a transposed allyl [[peroxide]]:\n\n[[File:Schenck ene reaction.svg|200px|center|alt=Reaction of singlet oxygen with an allyl structure to give allyl peroxide]]\n\n===Polymerization===\n{{main|polyolefin}}\n[[Polymerization]] of alkenes is a reaction that yields [[polymer]]s of high industrial value at great economy, such as the plastics [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]]. Polymers from alkene [[monomer]]s are referred to in a general way as ''[[polyolefin]]s'' or in rare instances as ''polyalkenes''. A polymer from [[alpha-olefin]]s is called a polyalphaolefin (PAO). Polymerization can proceed via either a free-[[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] or an ionic mechanism, converting the double to a single bond and forming single bonds to join the other monomers. Polymerization of [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] [[diene]]s such as [[buta-1,3-diene]] or [[isoprene]] (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene) results in largely 1,4-addition with possibly some 1,2-addition of the diene monomer to a growing polymer chain.\n\n===Metal complexation===\n:[[Image:Ni(cod)2.png|thumb|right|220px|Structure of [[bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0)]], a metal\u2013alkene complex]]\nAlkenes are [[ligand]]s in [[transition metal alkene complex]]es. The two carbon centres bond to the metal using the C\u2013C pi- and pi*-orbitals. Mono- and diolefins are often used as ligands in stable complexes. [[Cyclooctadiene]] and [[norbornadiene]] are popular chelating agents, and even [[ethylene]] itself is sometimes used as a ligand, for example, in [[Zeise's salt]]. In addition, metal\u2013alkene complexes are intermediates in many metal-catalyzed reactions including hydrogenation, hydroformylation, and polymerization.\n\n===Reaction overview===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"background-color:white;float: center; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0em 1em;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n\n! width=200px|Reaction name !!

Raw materials are mostly [[natural gas condensate]] components (principally ethane and propane) in the US and Mideast and [[naphtha]] in Europe and Asia. Alkanes are broken apart at high temperatures, often in the presence of a [[zeolite]] catalyst, to produce a mixture of primarily aliphatic alkenes and lower molecular weight alkanes. The mixture is feedstock and temperature dependent, and separated by fractional distillation. This is mainly used for the manufacture of small alkenes (up to six carbons).<ref name=\"Wade2\">{{cite book | last = Wade | first = L.G. | title = Organic Chemistry | publisher = Pearson [[Prentice Hall]] | date = 2006 |edition=6th| pages = 309 | isbn = 978-1-4058-5345-3 }}</ref>\n[[Image:OctaneCracking.svg|500px|center|Cracking of ''n''-octane to give pentane and propene]]\n\nRelated to this is catalytic [[dehydrogenation]], where an alkane loses hydrogen at high temperatures to produce a corresponding alkene.<ref name=\"Wade\"/> This is the reverse of the [[catalytic hydrogenation]] of alkenes.\n[[Image:ButaneDehydrogenation.svg|600px|center|Dehydrogenation of butane to give butadiene and isomers of butene]]\nThis process is also known as [[Catalytic reforming|reforming]].  Both processes are endothermic and are driven towards the alkene at high temperatures by [[entropy]].\n\n[[Catalytic]] synthesis of higher \u03b1-alkenes (of the type RCH=CH<sub>2</sub>) can also be achieved by a reaction of ethylene with the [[organometallic compound]] [[triethylaluminium]] in the presence of [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], or [[platinum]].\n\n===Elimination reactions===\nOne of the principal methods for alkene synthesis in the laboratory is the room [[elimination reaction|elimination]] of alkyl halides, alcohols, and similar compounds. Most common is the \u03b2-elimination via the E2 or E1 mechanism,<ref name=\"PataiBook1964\">{{cite book | last = Saunders | first = W. H.  | editor = Patai, Saul | title = The Chemistry of Alkenes| publisher = Wiley Interscience | year = 1964 | pages = 149\u2013150 }}</ref> but \u03b1-eliminations are also known.\n\nThe E2 mechanism provides a more reliable \u03b2-elimination method than E1 for most alkene syntheses. Most E2 eliminations start with an alkyl halide or alkyl sulfonate ester (such as a [[tosylate]] or [[triflate]]). When an alkyl halide is used, the reaction is called a [[dehydrohalogenation]]. For unsymmetrical products, the more substituted alkenes (those with fewer hydrogens attached to the C=C) tend to predominate (see [[Zaitsev's rule]]). Two common methods of elimination reactions are dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides and dehydration of alcohols. A typical example is shown below; note that if possible, the H is ''anti'' to the leaving group, even though this leads to the less stable ''Z''-isomer.<ref name=Cram1956>{{cite journal\n | author = Cram, D.J.\n | year = 1956\n | title = Studies in Stereochemistry.

For example, the dehydration of [[ethanol]] produces ethene:\n:[[Ethanol|CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH]] + [[Sulfuric acid|H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]]  \u2192  [[Ethene|H<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub>]] +  H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + {{chem|HSO|4|\u2212}}\n\nAn alcohol may also be converted to a better leaving group (e.g., [[xanthate]]), so as to allow a milder ''syn''-elimination such as the [[Chugaev elimination]] and the [[Grieco elimination]]. Related reactions include eliminations by \u03b2-haloethers (the [[Boord olefin synthesis]]) and esters ([[ester pyrolysis]]).\n\nAlkenes can be prepared indirectly from alkyl [[amine]]s. The amine or ammonia is not a suitable leaving group, so the amine is first either [[alkylation|alkylated]] (as in the [[Hofmann elimination]]) or oxidized to an [[amine oxide]] (the [[Cope reaction]]) to render a smooth elimination possible. The Cope reaction is a ''syn''-elimination that occurs at or below 150&nbsp;\u00b0C, for example:<ref name=\"CopeElimination1973\">{{cite journal | author = Bach, R.D. | title=Mechanism of the Cope elimination | journal=J.

Such reactions are sometimes called ''olefinations''. The most well-known of these methods is the [[Wittig reaction]], but other related methods are known.\n\nThe Wittig reaction involves reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a [[Wittig reagent]] (or phosphorane) of the type Ph<sub>3</sub>P=CHR to produce an alkene and [[Triphenylphosphine oxide|Ph<sub>3</sub>P=O]]. The Wittig reagent is itself prepared easily from [[triphenylphosphine]] and an alkyl halide. The reaction is quite general and many functional groups are tolerated, even esters, as in this example:<ref name=\"Snider2006\">{{cite journal| last=Snider| first=Barry B. | title=Synthesis of ent-Thallusin | journal=Org. Lett.| year=2006| volume=8| pages=2123\u20136|doi=10.1021/ol0605777| pmid=16671797| last2=Matsuo| first2=Y| last3=Snider| first3=BB| issue=10| pmc=2518398 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:WittigReactionExample.png|350px|center|A typical example of the Wittig reaction]]\n\nRelated to the Wittig reaction is the [[Peterson olefination]]. This uses a less accessible silicon-based reagent in place of the phosphorane, but it allows for the selection of ''E''- or ''Z''-products. If an ''E''-product is desired, another alternative is the [[Julia olefination]], which uses the carbanion generated from a [[phenyl]] [[sulfone]]. The [[Takai olefination]] based on an organochromium intermediate also delivers E-products. A titanium compound, [[Tebbe's reagent]], is useful for the synthesis of methylene compounds; in this case, even esters and amides react.\n\nA pair of carbonyl compounds can also be reductively coupled together (with reduction) to generate an alkene. Symmetrical alkenes can be prepared from a single aldehyde or ketone coupling with itself, using [[titanium]] metal reduction (the [[McMurry reaction]]). If two different ketones are to be coupled, a more complex, indirect method such as the [[Barton\u2013Kellogg reaction]] may be used.\n\nA single ketone can also be converted to the corresponding alkene via its tosylhydrazone, using [[sodium methoxide]] (the [[Bamford\u2013Stevens reaction]]) or an alkyllithium (the [[Shapiro reaction]]).\n\n===Synthesis from alkenes: olefin metathesis and hydrovinylation===\n{{main|Olefin metathesis}}\nAlkenes can be prepared by exchange with other alkenes, in a reaction known as [[olefin metathesis]]. Frequently, loss of ethene gas is used to drive the reaction towards a desired product. In many cases, a mixture of geometric isomers is obtained, but the reaction tolerates many functional groups. The method is particularly effective for the preparation of cyclic alkenes, as in this synthesis of [[muscone]]:\n[[Image:MusconeViaRCM.svg|550px|center|Ring-closing metathesis used in synthesis of muscone]]\n\nTransition metal catalyzed [[hydrovinylation]] is another important alkene synthesis process starting from alkene itself.<ref name=Vogt2010>{{cite journal  | author = Vogt, D.  | year = 2010  | pages = 7166\u20138  | title = Cobalt-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrovinylation  | issue = 40  | pmid = 20672269  | journal = Angew.

Allenes are classified as [[polyene]]s with [[diene#Classes|cumulated dienes]]. The parent compound of allene is [[propadiene]]. Compounds with an allene-type structure but with more than three carbon atoms are called [[cumulene]]s. Allenes are much more reactive than most other [[alkene]]s. For example, their reactivity with gaseous [[chlorine]] is more like the reactivity of [[alkyne]]s than that of alkenes.\n\n==Structure and bonding==\n\n===Geometry===\n[[File:Allene3D.png|thumb|right|3D view of propadiene (allene)]]\nThe central carbon atom of allene forms two [[sigma bond]]s and two [[pi bond]]s.

The molecule can thus be thought of as a two-bladed [[propeller]]. A third twofold axis of rotation passes through the C=C=C bonds, and there is a mirror plane passing through both CH<sub>2</sub> planes. Thus this class of molecules belong to the D<sub>2d</sub> [[point group]].

Like other hydrocarbons, alkynes are generally hydrophobic but tend to be more reactive.\n\n==Chemical properties==\nAlkynes are characteristically more [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] than alkenes. Thus they add two equivalents of [[bromine]] whereas an alkene adds only one equivalent in the reaction. Other reactions are listed below. In some reactions, alkynes are less reactive than [[alkene]]s. For example, in a molecule with an -ene and an -yne group, addition occurs preferentially at the -ene.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rosser|author2=Williams|last-author-amp=yes|title=Modern Organic Chemistry for A-level|year=1977|publisher=Collins|location=Great Britain|isbn=0003277402|page=82}}</ref> Possible explanations involve the two \u03c0-bonds in the alkyne delocalising, which would reduce the energy of the \u03c0-system{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} or the stability of the intermediates during the reaction.\nThey show greater tendency to [[Polymerization|polymerize]] or [[oligomer]]ize than alkenes do. The resulting polymers, called [[polyacetylene]]s (which do not contain alkyne units) are [[conjugated system|conjugated]] and can exhibit semiconducting properties.\n\n==Structure and bonding==\nIn acetylene, the H\u2013C\u2261C [[bond angle]]s are 180\u00b0. By virtue of this bond angle, alkynes are rod-like. Correspondingly, cyclic alkynes are rare. [[Benzyne]] is highly unstable. The C\u2261C bond distance of 121 [[picometer]]s is much shorter than the C=C distance in [[alkene]]s (134&nbsp;pm) or the C\u2013C bond in alkanes (153&nbsp;pm).\n\n:[[File:Alkyne General Formulae V.2.png|thumb|center|580px|Illustrative alkynes: '''a''', acetylene, '''b''', two depictions of propyne, '''c''', 1-butyne, '''d''', 2-butyne, '''e''', the naturally-occurring 1-phenylhepta-1,3,5-triyne, and '''f''', the strained cycloheptyne. Triple bonds are highlighted <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''blue'''</span>.]]\n\nThe [[triple bond]] is very strong with a [[bond strength]] of 839 kJ/mol. The sigma bond contributes 369&nbsp;kJ/mol, the first pi bond contributes 268&nbsp;kJ/mol and the second pi-bond of 202&nbsp;kJ/mol bond strength. Bonding usually discussed in the context of [[molecular orbital theory]], which recognizes the triple bond as arising from overlap of s and p orbitals. In the language of [[valence bond theory]], the carbon atoms in an alkyne bond are [[sp hybridized]]: they each have two unhybridized [[p orbital]]s and two [[Orbital hybridisation|sp hybrid orbitals]]. Overlap of an sp orbital from each atom forms one sp\u2013sp [[sigma bond]]. Each p orbital on one atom overlaps one on the other atom, forming two [[pi bond]]s, giving a total of three bonds. The remaining sp orbital on each atom can form a sigma bond to another atom, for example to hydrogen atoms in the parent acetylene. The two sp orbitals project on opposite sides of the carbon atom.\n\n===Terminal and internal alkynes===\nInternal alkynes feature carbon substituents on each acetylenic carbon. Symmetrical examples include [[diphenylacetylene]] and [[3-hexyne]].\n\nTerminal alkynes have the formula RC<sub>2</sub>H. An example is [[methylacetylene]] (propyne using IUPAC nomenclature). Terminal alkynes, like [[acetylene]] itself, are mildly acidic, with p''K''<sub>a</sub> values of around 25. They are far more acidic than alkenes and alkanes, which have p''K''<sub>a</sub> values of around 40 and 50, respectively. The acidic hydrogen on terminal alkynes can be replaced by a variety of groups resulting in halo-, silyl-, and alkoxoalkynes. The [[carbanion]]s generated by deprotonation of terminal alkynes are called [[acetylide]]s.<ref name=\"de57\">{{cite book|last=Bloch|first=Daniel R.|title=Organic Chemistry Demystified|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-176797-2|pages=57|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n==Naming alkynes==\nIn [[Chemical nomenclature|systematic chemical nomenclature]], alkynes are named with the Greek prefix system without any additional letters. Examples include ethyne or octyne. In parent chains with four or more carbons, it is necessary to say where the triple bond is located. For [[octyne]], one can either write 3-octyne or oct-3-yne when the bond starts at the third carbon. The lowest number possible is given to the [[triple bond]]. When no superior functional groups are present, the parent chain must include the triple bond even if it is not the longest possible carbon chain in the molecule. Ethyne is commonly called by its trivial name acetylene.\n\nIn chemistry, the [[affix|suffix]] '''[[-yne]]''' is used to denote the presence of a triple bond. In [[organic chemistry]], the suffix often follows [[Chemical nomenclature|IUPAC nomenclature]]. However, [[inorganic compound]]s featuring [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturation]] in the form of triple bonds may be denoted by substitutive nomenclature with the same methods used with alkynes (i.e. the name of the corresponding saturated compound is modified by replacing the \"[[-ane]]\" ending with \"-yne\"). [[Polyyne|\"-diyne\"]] is used when there are two triple bonds, and so on. The position of unsaturation is indicated by a numerical [[locant]] immediately preceding the \"-yne\" suffix, or 'locants' in the case of multiple triple bonds. Locants are chosen so that the numbers are low as possible. \"-yne\" is also used as an [[infix]] to name substituent groups that are triply bound to the parent compound.\n\nSometimes a number between [[hyphen]]s is inserted before it to state which atoms the triple bond is between. This suffix arose as a collapsed form of the end of the word \"[[acetylene]]\". The final \"-e\" disappears if it is followed by another suffix that starts with a vowel.<ref>{{Cite book |author=The Commission on the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry |title=Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry |origyear= 1958 (A: Hydrocarbons, and B: Fundamental Heterocyclic Systems), 1965 (C: Characteristic Groups) |year=1971 |edition=3rd |publisher=Butterworths |location=London |isbn= 0-408-70144-7}}</ref>\n\n==Synthesis==\nCommercially, the dominant alkyne is acetylene itself, which is used as a fuel and a precursor to other compounds, e.g., [[acrylate]]s.

Depending on catalysts and conditions, alkynes add one or two equivalents of hydrogen.

The steam cracking of alkanes yields a few percent acetylene, which is selectively hydrogenated in the presence of a [[palladium]]/[[silver]] catalyst. For more complex alkynes, the [[Lindlar catalyst]] is widely recommended to avoid formation of the alkane, for example in the conversion of [[phenylacetylene]] to [[styrene]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | collvol = 5 | collvolpages = 880 | year = 1973 | prep = cv5p0880 | author = H.

In the [[thiol-yne reaction]] the substrate is a thiol.\n\nAcid-promoted addition reactions are likewise analogous to those of alkenes, including [[Markovnikov's rule|Markovnikov]] selectivity. [[Hydrohalogenation]] gives the corresponding [[vinyl halide]]s or alkyl dihalides, again depending on the number of equivalents of HX added.

Most notable is the [[Diels\u2013Alder reaction]] with 1,3-[[diene]]s to give [[1,4-cyclohexadienes]]. This general reaction has been extensively developed and electrophilic alkynes are especially effective [[dienophile]]s. The \"cycloadduct\" derived from the addition of alkynes to [[2-pyrone]] eliminates [[carbon dioxide]] to give the [[aromatic]] compound. Other specialized cycloadditions include multicomponent reactions such as [[alkyne trimerisation]] to give [[aromatic]] compounds and the [2+2+1]-cycloaddition of an alkyne, [[alkene]] and [[carbon monoxide]] in the [[Pauson\u2013Khand reaction]]. Non-carbon reagents also undergo cyclization, e.g. [[Azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition]] to give [[triazole]]s. Cycloaddition processes involving alkynes are often catalyzed by metals, e.g. [[enyne metathesis]] and [[alkyne metathesis]], which allows the scrambling of carbyne (RC) centers:\n:RC\u2261CR + R\u2032C\u2261CR\u2032 {{eqm}} 2&nbsp;RC\u2261CR\u2032\nOxidative cleavage of alkynes proceeds via cycloaddition to metal oxides. Most famously, [[potassium permanganate]] converts alkynes to a pair of [[carboxylic acid]]s.\n\n===Reactions specific for terminal alkynes===\nIn addition to undergoing the reactions characteristic of internal alkynes, terminal alkynes are reactive as weak acids, with [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]] values (25) between that of [[ammonia]] (35) and [[ethanol]] (16). The acetylide [[conjugate base]] is stabilized as a result of the high s character of the sp orbital, in which the electron pair resides. [[Electron]]s in an s orbital benefit from closer proximity to the positively charged atom nucleus, and are therefore lower in energy. Treatment of terminal alkynes with a [[strong base]] gives the corresponding [[metal acetylide]]s:\n:RC\u2261CH + MX \u2192 RC\u2261CM + HX{{spaces|5}} (MX = [[sodium amide|NaNH<sub>2</sub>]], [[N-Butyllithium|LiBu]], [[Grignard reagent|RMgX]])\nThe reactions of alkynes with certain metal cations, e.g. Ag<sup>+</sup> also gives acetylides. Thus, few drops of [[Tollens reagent|diamminesilver(I) hydroxide]] (Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OH) reacts with terminal alkynes signaled by formation of a white precipitate of the silver acetylide.\nAcetylide derivatives are synthetically useful [[nucleophile]]s that participate in C\u2013C bond forming reactions, as illustrated in the area called [[Carbonylation|\"Reppe Chemistry\"]].\n\nIn the [[Favorskii reaction]] and in [[alkynylation]]s in general, terminal alkynes add to [[carbonyl]] compounds to give the [[hydroxyalkyne]]. [[Coupling reaction|Coupling]] of terminal alkynes to give dialkynes is effected in the [[Cadiot\u2013Chodkiewicz coupling]], [[Glaser coupling]], and the [[Eglinton coupling]] reactions. Terminal alkynes can also be coupled to aryl or vinyl halides as in the [[Sonogashira coupling]].\n\nTerminal alkynes, including acetylene itself, can react with water to give aldehydes.  The transformation typically requires special metal catalysts to give this anti-Markovnikov addition result.<ref>Hintermann, Lukas; Labonne, Aurelie \"Catalytic hydration of alkynes and its application in synthesis\" Synthesis (2007), (8), 1121-1150. {{DOI|10.1055/s-2007-966002}}</ref>\n\n===Metal complexes===\n{{main|Transition metal alkyne complex}}\nAlkynes form complexes with transition metals.  Such compounds are sometimes useful reagents or illustrate the role that metals play in catalytic transformations of alkynes.\n\n==Alkynes in nature and medicine==\nAccording to Ferdinand Bohlmann, the first naturally occurring acetylenic compound, dehydromatricaria ester, was isolated from an ''Artemisia'' species in 1826. In the nearly two centuries that have followed, well over a thousand naturally occurring acetylenes have been discovered and reported. Polyynes, a subset of this class of natural products, have been isolated from a wide variety of plant species, cultures of higher fungi, bacteria, marine sponges, and corals.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Annabelle L.

A carbon\u2013carbon triple bond is also present in marketed drugs such as the antiretroviral [[Efavirenz]] and the antifungal [[Terbinafine]]. Molecules called ene-diynes feature a ring containing an alkene (\"ene\") between two alkyne groups (\"diyne\"). These compounds, e.g. [[calicheamicin]], are some of the most aggressive antitumor drugs known, so much so that the ene-diyne subunit is sometimes referred to as a \"warhead\".

Drugs that contain the nitrate moiety sometimes come back positive for Ames when they are indeed safe.  The nitrate compounds may generate [[nitric oxide]], an important signal molecule that can give a false positive.  [[Nitroglycerin]] is an example that gives a positive Ames yet is still used in treatment today.  Nitrates in food however may be reduced by bacterial action to nitrites which are known to generate carcinogens by reacting with amines and amides.  Long toxicology and outcome studies are needed with such compounds to disprove a positive Ames test.\n\n==Fluctuation method==\n[[Image:Wiki muta2.png|300px|right|thumb|Fluctuation method: 96-well plate]]\n[[File:Ames MPF 384 plate.jpg|thumb|300px|Fluctuation method: 384-well plate]]\nThe Ames test was initially developed using agar plates (the plate incorporation technique), as described above. Since that time, a popular alternative to performing the Ames test has been developed, which is known as the \"fluctuation method\". This technique is the same in concept as the agar-based method, with bacteria being added to a reaction mixture with a small amount of [[histidine]], which allows the bacteria to grow and mutate, returning to synthesize their own histidine. By including a pH indicator, the frequency of mutation is counted in microplates as the number of wells which have changed color (caused by a drop in pH due to metabolic processes of reproducing bacteria). As with the traditional Ames test, the sample is compared to the natural background rate of reverse mutation in order to establish the genotoxicity of a substance.The fluctuation method is performed entirely in liquid culture and is scored by counting the number of wells that turn yellow from purple in 96-well or 384-well microplates. \n \nIn the 96-well plate method the frequency of mutation is counted as the number of wells out of 96 which have changed color. The plates are incubated for up to five days, with mutated (yellow) colonies being counted each day and compared to the background rate of reverse mutation using established tables of significance to determine the significant differences between the background rate of mutation and that for the tested samples.\n\nIn the more scaled-down 384-well plate microfluctuation method the frequency of mutation is counted as the number of wells out of 48 which have changed color after 2 days of incubation. A test sample is assayed across 6 dose levels with concurrent zero-dose (background) and positive controls which all fit into one 384-well plate. The assay is performed in triplicates to provide statistical robustness. It uses the recommended OECD Guideline 471 tester strains (histidine auxotrophs and tryptophan auxotrophs).\n\nThe fluctuation method is comparable to the traditional pour plate method in terms of sensitivity and accuracy, however, it does have a number of advantages: it needs less test sample, it has a simple colorimetric endpoint, counting the number of positive wells out of possible 96 or 48 wells is much less time consuming than counting individual colonies on an agar plate. Several commercial kits are available. Most kits have consumable components in a ready-to-use state, including lyophilized bacteria, and tests can be performed using multichannel pipettes. The fluctuation method also allows for testing higher volumes of aqueous samples (up to 75% v/v), increasing the sensitivity and extending its application to low-level environmental mutagens.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bridges BA | title = The fluctuation test | journal = Archives of Toxicology | volume = 46 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 41\u20134 | date = November 1980 | pmid = 7235997 | doi = 10.1007/BF00361244 }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|32em}}\n*{{Cite journal|date=1989-03-01|title=Metabolic action of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to mutagens in the Ames test by various animal species including man|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0027510789901152|journal=Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis|language=en|volume=211|issue=1|pages=147\u2013151|doi=10.1016/0027-5107(89)90115-2|issn=0027-5107}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zm3sCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=the+ames+test+gelboin&source=bl&ots=OzhZkTceyy&sig=yAxUNrwKFAoksmHNA2nIQyx_X30&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjolKn236HaAhWQmOAKHe3pAYsQ6AEIbTAH#v=onepage&q=the%20ames%20test%20gelboin&f=false|title=The Understanding, Prevention and Control of Human Cancer: The Historic Work and Lives of Elizabeth Cavert Miller and James A.

Markers of electrolyte and water imbalance in the body such as [[hypotension]], low [[Distal convoluted tubule|distal tubule]] [[Sodium in biology|sodium]] concentration, decreased blood volume and high [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] tone trigger the release of the enzyme [[renin]] from the cells of [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]] in the kidney. Renin activates a circulating liver derived prohormone [[angiotensin]]ogen by proteolytic cleavage of all but its first ten [[amino acid]] residues known as [[angiotensin I]]. [[Angiotensin converting enzyme|ACE]] (Angiotensin converting enzyme) then removes a further two residues, converting angiotensin I into [[angiotensin II]].

ATI increases for the same reason; ATII and aldosterone decrease. [[Bradykinin]] increases because of less inactivation by ACE.\n\nUnder normal conditions, angiotensin II has these effects:\n* Vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy (enlargement) induced by ATII may lead to increased blood pressure and hypertension. Further, constriction of the [[efferent arteriole]]s of the kidney leads to increased perfusion pressure in the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]].\n* It contributes to [[ventricular remodeling]] and [[ventricular hypertrophy]] of the heart through stimulation of the [[proto-oncogene]]s [[c-fos]], [[c-jun]], [[c-myc]], [[transforming growth factor beta]] (TGF-B), through fibrogenesis and apoptosis (programmed cell death). \n* Stimulation by ATII of the [[adrenal cortex]] to release [[aldosterone]], a hormone that acts on kidney tubules, causes sodium and chloride ions retention and potassium excretion. Sodium is a \"water-holding\" ion, so water is also retained, which leads to increased blood volume, hence an increase in blood pressure.\n* Stimulation of the posterior pituitary to release [[vasopressin]] (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) also acts on the kidneys to increase water retention. If ADH production is excessive in heart failure, Na<sup>+</sup> level in the plasma may fall (hyponatremia), and this is a sign of increased risk of death in heart failure patients.\n* A decrease renal protein kinase C\n\nWith ACE inhibitor use, the production of ATII is decreased, which prevents aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex. This allows the kidney to excrete sodium ions along with obligate water, and retain potassium ions.

The other reported adverse effects are hepatotoxicity and effect on the fetus.<ref name=\"Sidorenkov & Navis 2014\"/>\nRenal impairment is a significant potential adverse effect of all ACE inhibitors that directly follows from their mechanism of action. Patients starting on an ACE inhibitor usually have a modest reduction in [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR) that stabilizes after several days. However, the decrease may be significant in conditions of decreased renal perfusion, such as renal artery stenosis, heart failure, polycystic kidney disease, or volume depletion. In these patients, maintenance of GFR depends on angiotensin-II-dependent efferent vasomotor tone. Therefore, [[renal function]] should be closely monitored over the first few days after initiation of treatment with ACE inhibitor in patients with decreased renal perfusion.<ref name=\"Sidorenkov & Navis 2014\"/> A moderate reduction in renal function, no greater than 30% rise in serum creatinine, that is stabilized after a week of treatment is deemed acceptable as part of the therapeutic effect, providing the residual renal function is sufficient. This is especially a problem if the patient is concomitantly taking an [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]] and a [[diuretic]].

Analysis of mortality reduction by different ACE inhibitors showed that perindopril-based regimens are associated with a statistically significant 13% all-cause mortality reduction.\nTaking into account the broad spectrum of the hypertensive population, one might expect that an effective treatment with ACE inhibitors, in particular with [[perindopril]], would result in an important gain of lives saved.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 22511654 | doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehs075 | volume=33 | issue=16 | title=Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality in hypertension: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system inhibitors involving 158,998 patients | pmc=3418510 |vauthors=van Vark LC, Bertrand M, Akkerhuis KM, Brugts JJ, Fox K, Mourad JJ, Boersma E | journal=Eur Heart J | pages=2088\u201397| year=2012 }}</ref>\n\n===ACE inhibitor equivalent doses in hypertension===\nThe ACE inhibitors have different strengths with different starting dosages.

ACE inhibitors do not completely prevent the formation of angiotensin II, as blockage is dose-dependent, so angiotensin II receptor antagonists may be useful because they act to prevent the action of angiotensin II at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, leaving AT<sub>2</sub> receptor unblocked; the latter may have consequences needing further study.\n\n===Use in combination===\nThe combination therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with ACE inhibitors may be superior to either agent alone. This combination may increase levels of bradykinin while blocking the generation of angiotensin II and its activity at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. This 'dual blockade' may be more effective than using an ACE inhibitor alone, because angiotensin II can be generated via non-ACE-dependent pathways.

The conversion of the inactive angiotensin I to the potent angiotensin II was thought to take place in the plasma. However, in 1967, [[Kevin K. F. Ng]] and [[John R. Vane]] showed plasma ACE is too slow to account for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II ''in vivo''. Subsequent investigation showed rapid conversion occurs during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.<ref name=\"Kevin\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ng KK, Vane JR | title = Conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II | journal = Nature | volume = 216 | issue = 5117 | pages = 762\u20136 | year = 1967 | pmid = 4294626 | doi = 10.1038/216762a0 }}</ref>\n\nBradykinin is rapidly inactivated in the circulating blood, and it disappears completely in a single pass through the pulmonary circulation. Angiotensin I also disappears in the pulmonary circulation because of its conversion to angiotensin II. Furthermore, angiotensin II passes through the lungs without any loss. The inactivation of bradykinin and the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the lungs was thought to be caused by the same enzyme.<ref name=\"Kevin2\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ng KK, Vane JR | title = Fate of Angiotensin I in the Circulation | journal = Nature | volume = 218 | issue = 5137 | pages = 144\u201350 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4296306 | doi = 10.1038/218144a0 }}</ref> In 1970, Ng and Vane, using BPF provided by Ferreira, showed the conversion is inhibited during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.<ref name=\"Kevin3\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ng KK, Vane JR | title = Some Properties of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme in the Lung in vivo | journal = Nature | volume = 225 | issue = 5238 | pages = 1142\u20134 | year = 1970 | pmid = 4313869 | doi = 10.1038/2251142b0 }}</ref>\n\nBPFs are members of a family of peptides whose potentiating action is linked to inhibition of bradykinin by ACE. Molecular analysis of BPF yielded a nonapeptide BPF [[teprotide]] (SQ 20,881), which showed the greatest ACE inhibition potency and hypotensive effect ''in vivo''. Teprotide had limited clinical value as a result of its peptide nature and lack of activity when given orally. In the early 1970s, knowledge of the structure-activity relationship required for inhibition of ACE was growing. [[David Cushman]], [[Miguel Ondetti]] and colleagues used peptide analogues to study the structure of ACE, using carboxypeptidase A as a model. Their discoveries led to the development of captopril, the first orally-active ACE inhibitor, in 1975.\n\nCaptopril was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1981. The first nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, enalapril, was marketed two years later. At least 12 other ACE inhibitors have since been marketed.\n\nIn 1991, Japanese scientists created the first milk-based ACE inhibitor, in the form of a fermented milk drink, using specific cultures to liberate the [[tripeptide]] [[isoleucine]]-[[proline]]-proline (IPP) from the dairy protein. [[Valine]]-proline-proline (VPP) is also liberated in this process\u2014another milk tripeptide with a very similar chemical structure to IPP. Together, these peptides are now often referred to as [[lactotripeptides]].

The standard is maintained by the X3/[[INCITS]] committee.<ref>[http://www.t13.org t13.org]</ref> It uses the underlying '''{{Not a typo|AT Attachment}}''' ('''ATA''') and '''{{Not a typo|AT Attachment}} Packet Interface''' ([[ATA Packet Interface|ATAPI]]) standards.\n\nThe Parallel ATA standard is the result of a long history of incremental technical development, which began with the original AT Attachment interface, developed for use in early [[PC AT]] equipment. The ATA interface itself evolved in several stages from [[Western Digital]]'s original '''Integrated Drive Electronics''' ('''IDE''') interface. As a result, many near-synonyms for ATA/ATAPI and its previous incarnations are still in common informal use, in particular '''Extended IDE''' ('''EIDE''') and '''Ultra ATA''' ('''UATA''').

The interface cards used to connect a parallel ATA drive to, for example, a [[PCI slot]] are not drive controllers: they are merely bridges between the host bus and the ATA interface. Since the original ATA interface is essentially just a 16-bit [[ISA bus]] in disguise, the bridge was especially simple in case of an ATA connector being located on an ISA interface card. The integrated controller presented the drive to the host computer as an array of 512-byte blocks with a relatively simple command interface. This relieved the mainboard and interface cards in the host computer of the chores of stepping the disk head arm, moving the head arm in and out, and so on, as had to be done with earlier [[ST-506]] and [[Enhanced Small Disk Interface|ESDI]] hard drives. All of these low-level details of the mechanical operation of the drive were now handled by the controller on the drive itself. This also eliminated the need to design a single controller that could handle many different types of drives, since the controller could be unique for the drive. The host need only to ask for a particular sector, or block, to be read or written, and either accept the data from the drive or send the data to it.\n\nThe interface used by these drives was standardized in 1994 as ANSI standard X3.221-1994, ''AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives''. After later versions of the standard were developed, this became known as \"ATA-1\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The PC Guide: ATA (ATA-1) |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/stdATA-c.html |accessdate=2008-08-23 |author=Charles M.

This card offers four separate interface connectors for IDE, Panasonic, Mitsumi, and Sony CDROM drives, but only one connector could be used since they all shared the same interface wiring.]]\n[[File:Soundblaster32.jpg|thumb|A [[SoundBlaster]] 32 16-bit ISA sound card, from after connector standardization had occurred, with an IDE interface for the CDROM drive.]]\n\nWhen PC motherboard makers started to include onboard ATA interfaces in place of the earlier ISA plug-in cards, there was usually only one ATA connector on the board, which could support up to two hard drives. At the time, in combination with the floppy drive, this was sufficient for most users. When the [[CD-ROM]] was developed, many computers would have been unable to accept these drives if they had been ATA devices, due to already having two hard drives installed. Adding the CD-ROM drive would have required removal of one of the drives.{{dubious|date=June 2014}}\n\n[[SCSI]] was available as a CD-ROM expansion option at the time, but devices with SCSI were more expensive than ATA devices due to the need for a smart interface that is capable of [[bus arbitration]]. SCSI typically added {{USD|100\u2013300}} to the cost of a storage device, in addition to the cost of a SCSI host adapter.\n\nThe less expensive solution was the addition of a dedicated CD-ROM interface, which was typically included as an expansion option on a [[sound card]]. PC motherboards initially did not come with support for more than simple beeps from [[PC speaker|internal speaker]]s; thus, sound cards (such as the [[Sound Blaster Pro]]) were available for use with games, operating system and software event sounds, or to listen to audio CDs. Also, sound cards commonly included a [[game port]] joystick/gamepad port along with interfaces to control a CD-ROM and transmit CD audio to the system.\n\nInitially, the second drive interface was not well defined. It was first introduced with interfaces specific to certain CD-ROM drives such as Mitsumi, Sony or Panasonic drives,<ref>[http://stason.org/TULARC/pc/sound-cards-multimedia/CREATIVE-LABS-INC-Sound-card-16-BIT-AUDIO-CARD-PAN.html Creative Labs sound card documentation showing diagram with custom Mitsumi, Sony, and Panasonic CD-ROM drive connectors]</ref> and it was common to find early sound cards with two or three separate connectors each designed to match a certain brand of CD-ROM drive. This evolved into the standard ATA interface for ease of cross-compatibility, though the sound card ATA interface still usually supported only a single CD-ROM and not hard drives.\n\nThis second ATA interface on the sound card eventually evolved into the second motherboard ATA interface which was long included as a standard component in all PCs.\nCalled the \"primary\" and \"secondary\" ATA interfaces, they were assigned to [[Input/Output Base Address|base addresses]] 0x1F0 and 0x170 on [[ISA bus]] systems.\n\n=== EIDE and ATA-2 ===\nIn 1994, about the same time that the ATA-1 standard was adopted, Western Digital introduced drives under a newer name, '''Enhanced IDE''' (EIDE). These included most of the features of the forthcoming ATA-2 specification and several additional enhancements. Other manufacturers introduced their own variations of ATA-1 such as \"Fast ATA\" and \"Fast ATA-2\".\n\nThe new version of the ANSI standard, ''AT Attachment Interface with Extensions ATA-2'' (X3.279-1996), was approved in 1996. It included most of the features of the manufacturer-specific variants.<ref>{{cite web |title=The PC Guide: ATA (ATA-2) |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/stdATA2-c.html |accessdate=2008-08-23 |author=Charles M.

Traditionally, a device on the ATA interface has been a hard disk drive, but any form of storage device may be placed on the ATA interface provided it adheres to this standard.|''AT Attachment Interface with Extensions (ATA-2)'', page 2<ref name=ATA2/>}}\n\n=== ATAPI ===\n{{main|ATA Packet Interface}}\n\nAs mentioned in the previous sections, ATA was originally designed for, and worked only with [[hard disk drive]]s and devices that could emulate them. The introduction of ATAPI (ATA Packet Interface) by a group called the [[Small Form Factor committee]] (SFF) allowed ATA to be used for a variety of other devices that require functions beyond those necessary for hard disk drives. For example, any removable media device needs a \"media eject\" command, and a way for the host to determine whether the media is present, and these were not provided in the ATA protocol.\n\nThe Small Form Factor committee approached this problem by defining ATAPI, the \"ATA Packet Interface\". ATAPI is actually a protocol allowing the ATA interface to carry [[SCSI]] commands and responses; therefore, all ATAPI devices are actually \"speaking SCSI\" other than at the electrical interface. In fact, some early ATAPI devices were simply SCSI devices with an ATA/ATAPI to SCSI protocol converter added on. The SCSI commands and responses are embedded in \"packets\" (hence \"ATA Packet Interface\") for transmission on the ATA cable. This allows any device class for which a SCSI command set has been defined to be interfaced via ATA/ATAPI.\n\nATAPI devices are also \"speaking ATA\", as the ATA physical interface and protocol are still being used to send the packets. On the other hand, ATA hard drives and solid state drives do not use ATAPI.\n\nATAPI devices include CD-ROM and [[DVD-ROM]] drives, [[tape drive]]s, and large-capacity [[floppy disk|floppy]] drives such as the [[Zip drive]] and [[SuperDisk drive]].\n\nThe SCSI commands and responses used by each class of ATAPI device (CD-ROM, tape, etc.) are described in other documents or specifications specific to those device classes\nand are not within ATA/ATAPI or the [[T13 subcommittee|T13]] committee's purview. <!-- ATAPI Packet Commands for Block Devices (SFF-8070i) ATAPI Packet Commands for CD-ROMs (SFF-8020i) --> One commonly used set is defined in the [[MultiMedia Commands|MMC]] SCSI command set.\n\nATAPI was adopted as part of ATA in INCITS 317-1998, ''AT Attachment with Packet Interface Extension (ATA/ATAPI-4)''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The PC Guide: SFF-8020 / ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/stdATAPI-c.html |accessdate=2008-08-23 |author=Charles M.

These initially supported speeds from 16 MByte/s to 33 MByte/second. In later versions, faster Ultra DMA modes were added, requiring new 80-wire cables to reduce crosstalk. The latest versions of Parallel ATA support up to 133 MByte/s.\n\n=== Ultra ATA ===\nUltra ATA, abbreviated UATA, is a designation that has been primarily used by [[Western Digital Corporation|Western Digital]] for different speed enhancements to the ATA/ATAPI standards. For example, in 2000 Western Digital published a document describing \"Ultra ATA/100\", which brought performance improvements for the then-current ATA/ATAPI-5 standard by improving maximum speed of the Parallel ATA interface from 66 to 100&nbsp;MB/s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/library/other/2579-001013.pdf|title=Ultra ATA/100 Extends Existing Technology While Increasing Performance and Data Integrity|author=Western Digital Corporation}}</ref> Most of Western Digital's changes, along with others, were included in the ATA/ATAPI-6 standard (2002).\n\n=== Current terminology ===\nThe terms \"integrated drive electronics\" (IDE), \"enhanced IDE\" and \"EIDE\" have come to be used interchangeably with ATA (now Parallel ATA, or PATA).\n\nIn addition, there have been several generations of \"EIDE\" drives marketed, compliant with various versions of the ATA specification. An early \"EIDE\" drive might be compatible with ATA-2, while a later one with ATA-6.\n\nNevertheless, a request for an \"IDE\" or \"EIDE\" drive from a computer parts vendor will almost always yield a drive that will work with most Parallel ATA interfaces.\n\nAnother common usage is to refer to the specification version by the fastest mode supported. For example, ATA-4 supported Ultra DMA modes 0 through 2, the latter providing a maximum transfer rate of 33 megabytes per second. ATA-4 drives are thus sometimes called \"UDMA-33\" drives, and sometimes \"ATA-33\" drives. Similarly, ATA-6 introduced a maximum transfer speed of 100 megabytes per second, and some drives complying to this version of the standard are marketed as \"PATA/100\" drives.\n\n=== x86 BIOS size limitations ===\n{{See also|Logical block addressing#Enhanced BIOS|l1=Enhanced BIOS}}\n<!-- Also, do we need to mention the earlier 504MB limit in earlier BIOSes, and make clear that it was not the interface's problem but rather the BIOS... or was it? Or is that so old that we don't need to bother? [_maybe the words \"such as\" already allow for the 504MB, 32MB, and other random limits_]-->\n\nInitially, the size of an ATA drive was stored in the system [[x86]] BIOS using a type number (1 through 45) that predefined the C/H/S parameters <ref name=pdef>[http://www.kva.kursk.ru/bios1/HTML1/standard.html kursk.ru \u2013 Standard CMOS Setup]</ref> and also often the landing zone, in which the drive heads are parked while not in use. Later, a \"user definable\" format<ref name=pdef/> called C/H/S or cylinders, heads, sectors was made available. These numbers were important for the earlier ST-506 interface, but were generally meaningless for ATA\u2014the CHS parameters for later ATA large drives often specified impossibly high numbers of heads or sectors that did not actually define the internal physical layout of the drive at all. From the start, and up to ATA-2, every user had to specify explicitly how large every attached drive was. From ATA-2 on, an \"identify drive\" command was implemented that can be sent and which will return all drive parameters.\n\nOwing to a lack of foresight by motherboard manufacturers, the system BIOS was often hobbled by artificial C/H/S size limitations due to the manufacturer assuming certain values would never exceed a particular numerical maximum.\n\nThe first of these BIOS limits occurred when ATA drives reached sizes in excess of 504 megabytes, because some motherboard BIOSes would not allow C/H/S values above 1024 cylinders, 16 heads, and 63 sectors. Multiplied by 512 bytes per sector, this totals {{gaps|528|482|304}} bytes which, divided by {{gaps|1|048|576}} bytes per megabyte, equals 504 megabytes.\n\nThe second of these BIOS limitations occurred at 1024 [[Cylinder-head-sector#Cylinders|cylinders]], 256 [[Cylinder-head-sector#Heads|heads]], and 63 [[Disk sector|sectors]], and a bug in [[MS-DOS]] and [[Windows 95|MS-Windows 95]] limited the number of heads to 255. This totals to {{gaps|8|422|686|720}} bytes, commonly referred to as the 8.4 gigabyte barrier. This is again a limit imposed by x86 BIOSes, and not a limit imposed by the ATA interface.\n\nIt was eventually determined that these size limitations could be overridden with a tiny program loaded at startup from a hard drive's boot sector. Some hard drive manufacturers, such as Western Digital, started including these override utilities with new large hard drives to help overcome these problems. However, if the computer was booted in some other manner without loading the special utility, the invalid BIOS settings would be used and the drive could either be inaccessible or appear to the operating system to be damaged.<!-- INT 13/48, EDD compatible !? -->\n\nLater, an extension to the x86 BIOS [[INT 13H|disk services]] called the \"[[Enhanced Disk Drive]]\" (EDD) was made available, which makes it possible to address drives as large as 2<sup>64</sup> sectors.<ref>[http://home.teleport.com/~brainy/interrupts.htm teleport.com \u2013 Interrupts Page]</ref>\n\n=== Interface size limitations ===\nThe first drive interface used 22-bit addressing mode which resulted in a maximum drive capacity of two gigabytes. Later, the first formalized ATA specification used a 28-bit addressing mode through [[LBA28]], allowing for the addressing of 2<sup>28</sup> ({{gaps|268|435|456}}) sectors (blocks) of 512 bytes each, resulting in a maximum capacity of 128&nbsp;[[Gibibyte|GiB]] (137&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]]).<ref>{{BDprefix|p=d}}</ref>\n\nATA-6 introduced 48-bit addressing, increasing the limit to 128&nbsp;[[Pebibyte|PiB]] (144&nbsp;[[Petabyte|PB]]). As a consequence, any ATA drive of capacity larger than about 137&nbsp;GB must be an ATA-6 or later drive. Connecting such a drive to a host with an ATA-5 or earlier interface will limit the usable capacity to the maximum of the interface.\n\nSome operating systems, including [[Windows XP]] pre-SP1, and [[Windows 2000]] pre-SP3, disable [[LBA48]] by default, requiring the user to take extra steps to use the entire capacity of an ATA drive larger than about 137 gigabytes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.48bitlba.com/enablebiglba.htm |title=EnableBigLba Registry Setting in Windows 2000 and XP |author=FryeWare |year=2005 |accessdate=2011-12-29}}  The setting is <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\atapi\\Parameters\\EnableBigLba = 1</code>.</ref>\n\nOlder operating systems, such as [[Windows 98]], do not support 48-bit LBA at all.

In some systems, a third and fourth motherboard interface was provided, allowing up to eight ATA devices to be attached to the motherboard. Often, these additional connectors were implemented by inexpensive [[RAID]] controllers.\n\nSoon after the introduction of [[Serial ATA]] (SATA) in 2003, use of Parallel ATA declined. The first motherboards with built-in SATA interfaces usually had only a single PATA connector (for up to two PATA devices), along with multiple SATA connectors.\n\nAs of 2007, some PC [[chipset]]s, for example the Intel ICH10, had removed support for PATA. Motherboard vendors still wishing to offer Parallel ATA with those chipsets must include an additional interface chip. In more recent computers, the Parallel ATA interface is rarely used even if present, as four or more Serial ATA connectors are usually provided on the motherboard and SATA devices of all types are common.\n\nWith [[Western Digital]]'s withdrawal from the PATA market, hard disk drives with the PATA interface were no longer in production after December 2013 for other than specialty applications.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.myce.com/news/western-digital-stops-sales-of-pata-drives-69960/#! |title=Western Digital stops sales of PATA drives |work=Myce.com |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2013-12-25}}</ref>\n\n== Parallel ATA interface ==\n[[File:nappe.svg|center|Ribbon cable with two connectors]]\n\nParallel ATA cables transfer data 16 bits at a time. The traditional cable uses 40-pin connectors attached to a [[ribbon cable]]. Each cable has two or three connectors, one of which plugs into an adapter interfacing with the rest of the computer system. The remaining connector(s) plug into storage devices, most commonly hard disk drives or optical drives.\n\nATA's cables have had 40 wires for most of its history (44 conductors for the smaller form-factor version used for 2.5\" drives\u2014the extra four for power), but an 80-wire version appeared with the introduction of the ''UDMA/66'' mode. All of the additional wires in the new cable are [[ground (electricity)|ground]] wires, interleaved with the previously defined wires to reduce the effects of [[capacitive coupling]] between neighboring signal wires, reducing [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]]. Capacitive coupling is more of a problem at higher transfer rates, and this change was necessary to enable the 66 megabytes per second (MB/s) transfer rate of ''UDMA4'' to work reliably. The faster ''UDMA5'' and ''UDMA6'' modes also require 80-conductor cables.\n\n[[File:ATA cables.jpg|thumb|300px|ATA cables: 40-wire ribbon cable (top), and 80-wire ribbon cable (bottom)]]\n\nThough the number of wires doubled, the number of connector pins and the pinout remain the same as 40-conductor cables, and the external appearance of the connectors is identical. Internally, the connectors are different; the connectors for the 80-wire cable connect a larger number of ground wires to the ground pins, while the connectors for the 40-wire cable connect ground wires to ground pins one-for-one. 80-wire cables usually come with three differently colored connectors (blue, black, and gray for controller, master drive, and slave drive respectively) as opposed to uniformly colored 40-wire cable's connectors (commonly all gray). The gray connector on 80-conductor cables has pin 28 CSEL not connected, making it the slave position for drives configured cable select.\n\nRound parallel ATA cables (as opposed to ribbon cables) were eventually made available for '[[case mod]]ders' for cosmetic reasons, as well as claims of  improved [[computer cooling#Rounded cables|computer cooling]] and were easier to handle; however, only ribbon cables are supported by the ATA specifications.\n\n; Pin 20\nIn the ATA standard, pin 20 is defined as (mechanical) key and is not used. This socket on the female connector is often obstructed, requiring pin 20 to be omitted from the male cable or drive connector, making it impossible to plug it in the wrong way round; a male connector with pin 20 present cannot be used. However, some [[flash memory]] drives can use pin 20 as VCC_in to power the drive without requiring a special power cable; this feature can only be used if the equipment supports this use of pin 20.<ref>[http://www.transcendusa.com/Support/FAQ/index.asp?axn=Detail&LangNo=0&FAQNo=212 Welcome to Transcend website]</ref>\n\n; Pin 28\nPin 28 of the gray (slave/middle) connector of an 80-conductor cable is not attached to any conductor of the cable. It is attached normally on the black (master drive end) and blue (motherboard end) connectors.\n\n; Pin 34\nPin 34 is connected to ground inside the blue connector of an 80-conductor cable but not attached to any conductor of the cable. It is attached normally on the gray and black connectors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.t10.org/t13/project/d1321r3-ATA-ATAPI-5.pdf |title=Information Technology - AT Attachment with Packet Interface - 5 (ATA/ATAPI-5) - Working Draft |page=315 |date=2000-02-29 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref>\n\n=== 44 pin variant ===\n\nA 44 pin variant PATA interface is used for 2.5 inch drives inside laptops. The pins are closer together and the connector is physically smaller than the 40 pin interface. The extra pins carry power.\n\n=== Differences between connectors on 80-conductor cables ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:PATA-Connectors-exposed.png|thumb|right|300px|Differences between connectors]]\n\nThe image on the right shows PATA connectors after removal of strain relief, cover, and cable. Pin one is at bottom left of the connectors, pin 2 is top left, etc., except that the lower image of the blue connector shows the view from the opposite side, and pin one is at top right.\n\nThe connector is an [[insulation-displacement connector]]\u2014in other words, each contact comprises a pair of points which together pierce the insulation of the ribbon cable with such precision that they make a connection to the desired conductor without harming the insulation on the neighboring wires. The center row of contacts are all connected to the common ground bus and attached to the odd numbered conductors of the cable. The top row of contacts are the even-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the even-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to every other even-numbered conductor of the cable. The bottom row of contacts are the odd-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the odd-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to the remaining even-numbered conductors of the cable.\n\nNote the connections to the common ground bus from sockets 2 (top left), 19 (center bottom row), 22, 24, 26, 30, and 40 on all connectors. Also note (enlarged detail, bottom, looking from the opposite side of the connector) that socket 34 of the blue connector does not contact any conductor but unlike socket 34 of the other two connectors, it does connect to the common ground bus. On the gray connector, note that socket 28 is completely missing, so that pin 28 of the drive attached to the gray connector will be open. On the black connector, sockets 28 and 34 are completely normal, so that pins 28 and 34 of the drive attached to the black connector will be connected to the cable. Pin 28 of the black drive reaches pin 28 of the host receptacle but not pin 28 of the gray drive, while pin 34 of the black drive reaches pin 34 of the gray drive but not pin 34 of the host. Instead, pin 34 of the host is grounded.\n\nThe standard dictates color-coded connectors for easy identification by both installer and cable maker. All three connectors are different from one another. The blue (host) connector has the socket for pin 34 connected to ground inside the connector but not attached to any conductor of the cable. Since the old 40 conductor cables do not ground pin 34, the presence of a ground connection indicates that an 80 conductor cable is installed. The wire for pin 34 is attached normally on the other types and is not grounded. Installing the cable backwards (with the black connector on the system board, the blue connector on the remote device and the gray connector on the center device) will ground pin 34 of the remote device and connect host pin 34 through to pin 34 of the center device. The gray center connector omits the connection to pin 28 but connects pin 34 normally, while the black end connector connects both pins 28 and 34 normally.\n\n=== Multiple devices on a cable ===\nIf two devices are attached to a single cable, one must be designated as ''device 0'' (commonly referred to as ''master'') and the other as ''device 1'' (''slave''). This distinction is necessary to allow both drives to share the cable without conflict. The ''master'' drive is the drive that usually appears \"first\" to the computer's [[BIOS]] and/or [[operating system]]. On old BIOSes ([[Intel 486]] era and older), the drives are often referred to by the BIOS as \"C\" for the master and \"D\" for the slave following the way DOS would refer to the active primary partitions on each.\n\nThe mode that a drive must use is often set by a [[Jumper (computing)|jumper setting]] on the drive itself, which must be manually set to ''master'' or ''slave''. If there is a single device on a cable, it should be configured as ''master''. However, some hard drives have a special setting called ''single'' for this configuration (Western Digital, in particular). Also, depending on the hardware and software available, a single drive on a cable will often work reliably even though configured as the ''slave'' drive (most often seen where an optical drive is the only device on the secondary ATA interface).\n\n=== Cable select ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[CS]] -->\nA drive mode called ''cable select'' was described as optional in ATA-1 and has come into fairly widespread use with ATA-5 and later. A drive set to \"cable select\" automatically configures itself as master or slave, according to its position on the cable. Cable select is controlled by pin 28. The host adapter grounds this pin; if a device sees that the pin is grounded, it becomes the master device; if it sees that pin 28 is open, the device becomes the slave device.\n\nThis setting is usually chosen by a [[Jumper (computing)|jumper setting]] on the drive called \"cable select\", usually marked ''CS'', which is separate from the \"master\" or \"slave\" setting.\n\nNote that if two drives are configured as ''master'' and ''slave'' manually, this configuration does not need to correspond to their position on the cable. Pin 28 is only used to let the drives know their position on the cable; it is not used by the host when communicating with the drives.\n\nWith the 40-wire cable, it was very common to implement cable select by simply cutting the pin 28 wire between the two device connectors; putting the slave device at the end of the cable, and the master on the middle connector. This arrangement eventually was standardized in later versions. If there is just one device on the cable, this results in an unused stub of cable, which is undesirable for physical convenience and electrical reasons. The stub causes [[signal reflections]], particularly at higher transfer rates.\n\nStarting with the 80-wire cable defined for use in ATAPI5/UDMA4, the master device goes at the end of the {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} cable\u2014the black connector\u2014and the slave device goes on the middle connector\u2014the gray one\u2014and the blue connector goes onto the motherboard. So, if there is only one (master) device on the cable, there is no cable stub to cause reflections. Also, cable select is now implemented in the slave device connector, usually simply by omitting the contact from the connector body.\n\n==== Master and slave clarification ====\nAlthough they are in extremely common use, the terms [[Master/slave (technology)|\"master\" and \"slave\"]] do not actually appear in current versions of the ATA specifications. The two devices are simply referred to as \"device 0\" and \"device 1\", respectively, in ATA-2 and later.\n\nIt is a common myth that the controller on the master drive assumes control over the slave drive, or that the master drive may claim priority of communication over the other device on the same ATA interface. In fact, the drivers in the host operating system perform the necessary arbitration and serialization, and each drive's onboard controller operates independently of the other.\n\n=== Serialized, overlapped, and queued operations ===\nThe parallel ATA protocols up through ATA-3 require that once a command has been given on an ATA interface, it must complete before any subsequent command may be given. Operations on the devices must be serialized{{mdashb}}with only one operation in progress at a time{{mdashb}}with respect to the ATA host interface. A useful mental model is that the host ATA interface is busy with the first request for its entire duration, and therefore can not be told about another request until the first one is complete. The function of serializing requests to the interface is usually performed by a device driver in the host operating system.\n\nThe ATA-4 and subsequent versions of the specification have included an \"overlapped feature set\" and a \"queued feature set\" as optional features, both being given the name \"[[Tagged Command Queuing]]\" (TCQ), a reference to a set of features from SCSI which the ATA version attempts to emulate. However, support for these is extremely rare in actual parallel ATA products and device drivers because these feature sets were implemented in such a way as to maintain software compatibility with its heritage as originally an extension of the ISA bus. This implementation resulted in excessive CPU utilization which largely negated the advantages of command queuing. By contrast, overlapped and queued operations have been common in other storage buses; in particular, SCSI's version of tagged command queuing had no need to be software compatible with ISA's APIs, allowing it to attain high performance with low overhead on buses which supported first party DMA like PCI. This has long been seen as a major advantage of SCSI.\n\nThe Serial ATA standard has supported [[Native Command Queuing|native command queueing]] (NCQ) since its first release, but it is an optional feature for both host adapters and target devices. Many obsolete PC motherboards do not support NCQ, but modern SATA hard disk drives and SATA [[solid-state drive]]s usually support NCQ, which is not the case for removable (CD/DVD) drives because the ATAPI command set used to control them prohibits queued operations.\n\n=== Two devices on one cable\u2014speed impact ===\nThere are many debates about how much a slow device can impact the performance of a faster device on the same cable. There is an effect, but the debate is confused by the blurring of two quite different causes, called here \"Lowest speed\" and \"One operation at a time\".\n\n==== \"Lowest speed\" ====\nIt is a common misconception that, if two devices of different speed capabilities are on the same cable, both devices' data transfers will be constrained to the speed of the slower device.\n\nFor all modern ATA host adapters, this is not true, as modern ATA host adapters support ''independent device timing''. This allows each device on the cable to transfer data at its own best speed. Even with older adapters without independent timing, this effect applies only to the data transfer phase of a read or write operation. This is usually the shortest part of a complete read or write operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confTiming-c.html |title=Independent Master/Slave Device Timing |accessdate=2008-08-08 |author=Charles M. Kozierok |date=2001-04-17 |work=The PC Guide}}</ref>\n\n==== \"One operation at a time\" ====\nThis is caused by the omission of both overlapped and queued feature sets from most parallel ATA products. Only one device on a cable can perform a read or write operation at one time; therefore, a fast device on the same cable as a slow device '''under heavy use''' will find it has to wait for the slow device to complete its task first.\n\nHowever, most modern devices will report write operations as complete once the data is stored in their onboard cache memory, before the data is written to the (slow) magnetic storage. This allows commands to be sent to the other device on the cable, reducing the impact of the \"one operation at a time\" limit.\n\nThe impact of this on a system's performance depends on the application. For example, when copying data from an optical drive to a hard drive (such as during software installation), this effect probably will not matter. Such jobs are necessarily limited by the speed of the optical drive no matter where it is. But if the hard drive in question is also expected to provide good throughput for other tasks at the same time, it probably should not be on the same cable as the optical drive.\n\n=== HDD passwords and security ===\n{{redirect|ATA Secure Erase|ATA Secure Erase with flash memory|Write amplification#Secure erase|general use|Disk formatting#Recovery of data from a formatted disk}}\n\nATA devices may support an optional security feature which is defined in an ATA specification, and thus not specific to any brand or device. The security feature can be enabled and disabled by sending special ATA commands to the drive. If a device is locked, it will refuse all access until it is unlocked.\n\nA device can have two passwords: A User Password and a Master Password. Either or both may be set; there is a Master Password identifier feature which if supported and used can identifies with out disclosing the current Master Password.\n\nA device can be locked in two modes: High security mode or Maximum security mode. Bit 8 in word 128 of the IDENTIFY response shows which mode the disk is in: 0 = High, 1 = Maximum.\n\nIn High security mode, the device can be unlocked with either the User or Master password, using the \"SECURITY UNLOCK DEVICE\" ATA command. There is an attempt limit, normally set to 5, after which the disk must be power cycled or hard-reset before unlocking can be attempted again. Also in High security mode, the SECURITY ERASE UNIT command can be used with either the User or Master password.\n\nIn Maximum security mode, the device can be unlocked only with the User password. If the User password is not available, the only remaining way to get at least the bare hardware back to a usable state is to issue the SECURITY ERASE PREPARE command, immediately followed by SECURITY ERASE UNIT. In Maximum security mode, the SECURITY ERASE UNIT command requires the Master password and will completely erase all data on the disk. Word 89 in the IDENTIFY response indicates how long the operation will take.<ref>[http://www.rockbox.org/lock.html Rockbox \u2013 Unlocking a password protected harddisk]</ref>\n\nWhile the ATA lock is intended to be impossible to defeat without a valid password, there are purported workarounds to unlock a device.\n\n=== External parallel ATA devices ===\n[[File:LG Super Multi GSA-E40N - PATA 2 USB Adapter-8672.jpg|thumb|PATA to USB Adapter. It is mounted on the rear of a DVD-RW optical drive inside an external case]]\nDue to a short cable length specification and shielding issues it is extremely uncommon to find external PATA devices that directly use PATA for connection to a computer. A device connected externally needs additional cable length to form a U-shaped bend so that the external device may be placed alongside, or on top of the computer case, and the standard cable length is too short to permit this.  For ease of reach from motherboard to device, the connectors tend to be positioned towards the front edge of motherboards, for connection to devices protruding from the front of the computer case. This front-edge position makes extension out the back to an external device even more difficult. Ribbon cables are poorly shielded, and the standard relies upon the cabling to be installed inside a shielded computer case to meet RF emissions limits.\n\nExternal hard disk drives or optical disk drives that have an internal PATA interface, use some other interface technology to bridge the distance between the external device and the computer. USB is the most common external interface, followed by Firewire. A bridge chip inside the external devices converts from the USB interface to PATA, and typically only supports a single external device without cable select or master/slave.\n\n== Compact Flash interface ==\n[[File:Compact Flash is just a miniature IDE-ATA interface.jpg|thumb|Compact flash is a miniature ATA interface, slightly modified to be able to also supply power to the CF device.]]\n\n[[Compact Flash#Technical details|Compact Flash]] in its ''IDE mode'' is essentially a miniaturized ATA interface, intended for use on devices that use flash memory storage. No interfacing chips or circuitry are required, other than to directly adapt the smaller CF socket onto the larger ATA connector.\n\nThe ATA connector specification does not include pins for supplying power to a CF device, so power is inserted into the connector from a separate source. The exception to this is when the CF device is connected to a 44-pin ATA bus designed for 2.5-inch hard disk drives, commonly found in notebook computers, as this bus implementation must provide power to a standard hard disk drive.\n\nCF devices can be designated as master or slave on an ATA interface, though since most CF devices offer only a single socket, it is not necessary to offer this selection to end users.  Although CF can be [[hot-pluggable]] with additional design methods, by default when wired directly to an ATA interface, it is not intended to be hot-pluggable.\n\n== ATA standards versions, transfer rates, and features ==\nThe following table shows the names of the versions of the ATA standards and the transfer modes and rates supported by each. Note that the transfer rate for each mode (for example, 66.7&nbsp;MB/s for UDMA4, commonly called \"Ultra-DMA 66\", defined by ATA-5) gives its maximum theoretical transfer rate on the cable. This is simply two bytes multiplied by the effective clock rate, and presumes that every clock cycle is used to transfer end-user data. In practice, of course, protocol overhead reduces this value.\n\nCongestion on the host bus to which the ATA adapter is attached may also limit the maximum burst transfer rate. For example, the maximum data transfer rate for [[conventional PCI]] bus is 133&nbsp;MB/s, and this is shared among all active devices on the bus.\n\nIn addition, no ATA [[hard drive]]s existed in 2005 that were capable of measured sustained transfer rates of above 80&nbsp;MB/s. Furthermore, sustained transfer rate tests do not give realistic throughput expectations for most workloads: They use I/O loads specifically designed to encounter almost no delays from seek time or rotational latency. Hard drive performance under most workloads is limited first and second by those two factors; the transfer rate on the bus is a distant third in importance. Therefore, transfer speed limits above 66&nbsp;MB/s really affect performance only when the hard drive can satisfy all I/O requests by reading from its internal [[disk buffer|cache]]\u2014a very unusual situation, especially considering that such data is usually already buffered by the operating system.\n\n{{As of|2010|4}}, mechanical hard disk drives can transfer data at up to 157&nbsp;MB/s,<ref name=\"Tom2010HardDrives\">{{cite news |title=VelociRaptor Returns: 6Gb/s, 600GB, And 10,000 RPM  |publisher=tomshardware.com |author=Patrick Schmid and Achim Roos |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wd6000hlhx-velociraptor-600gb,2600-5.html |date=2010-04-06 |accessdate=2010-06-26|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5uKd8rggb |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}</ref> which is beyond the capabilities of the PATA/133 specification.

This is a 16-bit CRC, and it is used for data blocks only. Transmission of command and status blocks do not use the fast signaling methods that would necessitate CRC. For comparison, in Serial ATA, 32-bit CRC is used for both commands and data.<ref>{{cite web |title=Serial ATA\u2014A Comparison with Ultra ATA Technology |url=http://www.serialata.org/docs/serialata%20-%20a%20comparison%20with%20ultra%20ata%20technology.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203002431/http%3A//www.serialata.org/docs/serialata%2520-%2520a%2520comparison%2520with%2520ultra%2520ata%2520technology.pdf |archivedate=2007-12-03 |deadurl=yes}} www.serialata.org</ref>\n\n=== Features introduced with each ATA revision ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

These can be supported as bootable devices by a BIOS complying with the '''ATAPI Removable Media Device BIOS Specification''',<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.phoenix.com/NR/rdonlyres/EDD1AAA0-177E-4024-A0B1-E4BD06B673F7/0/specsatapi.pdf\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100102024104/http://www.phoenix.com/NR/rdonlyres/EDD1AAA0-177E-4024-A0B1-E4BD06B673F7/0/specsatapi.pdf\n | title = ATAPI Removable Media Device BIOS Specification, Version&nbsp;1.0\n | date = 1997-01-30 | accessdate = 2015-08-25 | archivedate = 2010-01-02\n | author1 = Curtis E.

It specifies provisions in the [[BIOS]] of a [[personal computer]] to allow the computer to be [[booting|bootstrapped]] from devices such as [[Iomega Zip drive|Zip drives]], [[Iomega Jaz drive|Jaz drives]], [[SuperDisk]] (LS-120) drives, and similar devices.\n\nThese devices have removable media like [[Floppy disk|floppy disk drives]], but capacities more commensurate with [[hard drive]]s, and programming requirements unlike either. Due to limitations in the floppy controller interface most of these devices were [[ATA Packet Interface|ATAPI]] devices, connected to one of the host computer's ATA interfaces, similarly to a hard drive or [[CD-ROM]] device. However, existing BIOS standards did not support these devices. An ARMD-compliant BIOS allows these devices to be booted from and used under the operating system without requiring device-specific code in the OS.\n\nA BIOS implementing ARMD allows the user to include ARMD devices in the boot search order. Usually an ARMD device is configured earlier in the boot order than the hard drive. Similarly to a floppy drive, if bootable media is present in the ARMD drive, the BIOS will boot from it; if not, the BIOS will continue in the search order, usually with the hard drive last.\n\nThere are two variants of ARMD, ARMD-FDD and ARMD-HDD. Originally ARMD caused the devices to appear as a sort of very large floppy drive, either the primary floppy drive device 00h or the secondary device 01h. Some operating systems required code changes to support floppy disks with capacities far larger than any standard floppy disk drive. Also, standard-floppy disk drive emulation proved to be unsuitable for certain high-capacity floppy disk drives such as [[Iomega Zip drive]]s.

This contrasts with the older model of having [[dedicated console|dedicated]] hardware that could play only those games that were physically built into the unit. The 2600 was bundled with two [[joystick]] [[game controller|controllers]], a conjoined pair of [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]] controllers, and a game cartridge: initially ''[[Combat (1977 video game)|Combat]]'',<ref name=combat>{{cite web | last = Weesner | first = Jason | title =On Game Design: A History of Video Games | date= January 11, 2007 | url =http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features/327/on_game_design_a_history_of_video_.php?page=3 | accessdate = November 13, 2007 }}</ref> and later ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Pac-Man]]''.<ref name=2600pacman>{{cite web|url=http://www.mr-atari.com/afbeeldingen/systems/2600pacmanblue.jpg|title=Image of box with Pac-Man sticker|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nEntering 1975, Atari was already successful with its arcade games and dedicated home consoles that recreated these games (such as ''[[Pong]]''), but there were increasing costs and risks in these adaptations. The company wanted to push for a home console that could play multiple games, necessitating a microprocessor which were still costly. Breadboard development of this system, nicknamed \"Stella\", coincided with the release of the [[MOS Technology 6502]] microprocessor, one of the first low-cost processors to hit the market; Atari worked with MOS Technology and established the use of their less-powerful [[MOS Technology 6507]] for the platform. Further, Atari's [[Jay Miner]] led development of the [[Television Interface Adapter]] (TIA) chip which performed all the graphics and audio output to the television display necessary for the platform. These were coupled with the necessary input/output ports with a ROM cartridge reader and joystick controllers to complete the system. Atari's system was still in development when the Fairchild Channel F was announced, leading Atari's owner [[Nolan Bushnell]] to sell Atari to [[Warner Communications]] in 1976, in exchange for a cash infusion to speed up development. Initial production for the console's November 1977 release was made at Atari's [[Sunnyvale, California]] location while future units were produced in [[Hong Kong]].\n\nThe Atari 2600 sold moderately well in its first few years, relying principally on [[Porting|ports]] of arcade games, both from Atari and titles licensed from others. Disagreements over sales potential of the 2600 led Bushnell to leave Atari in 1979. Following the release of Atari's licensed version of ''[[Space Invaders]]'' from [[Taito]] in 1980, the 2600 became widely successful, leading to the creation of third-party game developers, notably [[Activision]], and competition  from other home console makers such as [[Coleco]] and [[Mattel Electronics]] by 1982. Atari invested heavily in two games for the 2600, ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', that would become commercial failures for Atari and contributed to the [[video game crash of 1983]]. The 2600 was shelved as the industry recovered, while Warner sold off the home console division of Atari to [[Commodore International|Commodore]]. The new [[Atari Corporation]] under Commodore re-released a low-cost streamlined version of the 2600 in 1986, as well as the [[Atari 7800]] that boasted backwards compatibility with the 2600. Ultimately, production of the Atari 2600 and other home consoles ended in 1992, with an estimated 30 million units of the 2600 sold as of 2004.\n\n==History==\nAtari was founded by [[Nolan Bushnell]] and [[Ted Dabney]] of which their first major product was ''[[Pong]]'' in 1972, one of the first successful [[arcade game]]s.<ref name=\"inc bushnell\">{{Cite magazine |url = https://www.inc.com/magazine/20090401/the-gamer.html  |title = Nolan Busnell is Back in the Game|last = Chafkin, Max|date = April 1, 2009|magazine = [[Inc.

Based on Bushnell's concern about single-game consoles, the Grass Valley team started working on how to achieve a home console with multi-game support. Mayer and Emmons recognized that to achieve a home console with multiple game functionality, they would need newly-invented [[microprocessor]]s within the console, but at that time, such microprocessors costed from {{USD|100-300}}, far outside the range that their market would support.<ref name=\"gamespy history p1\"/> In September 1975, [[Chuck Peddle]] of [[MOS Technology]] had created a low-cost replacement for the [[Motorola 6800]], the [[MOS Technology 6502]], which they introduced at the 1975 Wescon trade show in San Francisco. Mayer and Ron Milner attended the show, met with Peddle, and later invited Peddle to Cyan's headquarters to discuss using MOS's microprocessors for a game console. Mayer and Milner had been able to negotiate purchase of the 6502 chips for {{USD|8}} a piece, sufficient to begin development of a console.<ref name=\"gamasutra history atari\"/> Through their discussions, Cyan and MOS decided that the better solution would be the [[MOS Technology 6507]], which was a more restrictive but lower-cost version of the 6502.

The back bezel also includes the ports for controllers, television output, and power adapter outlets.\n\n===Graphics===\n{{Main|Television Interface Adapter}}\nThe 2600 did not use a [[framebuffer|frame buffer]]. Instead the video device uses two [[bitmap]]ped [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]: two 1-pixel \"missile\" sprites, a 1-pixel \"ball\", and a 40-pixel \"playfield\" that is drawn by writing a bit pattern for each line into a register just before the television scans that line. As each line is scanned, a game must identify the non-sprite objects that overlaps the next line, assemble the appropriate bit patterns to draw for those objects, and write the pattern into the register. Similar to its predecessor Pong, the right side of the screen is a mirrored duplicate of the left; to control it separately, the software may modify the patterns as the scan line is drawn. After the controller scans the last active line, a slower [[vertical blanking interval]] begins, during which the game can process inputs and update the positions and states of objects in the game world. Any mistake in timing produces visual artifacts, a problem that programmers call \"racing the beam\".<ref name=\"RacingTheBeam\">{{cite book\n | first        = Ian\n | last         = Bogost\n | authorlink   = Ian Bogost\n | first2       = Nick\n | last2        = Montfort\n | author2-link = Nick Montfort\n | title        = [[Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System]]\n | year         = 2009\n | publisher    = [[MIT Press]]\n | isbn         = 0-262-01257-X }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:A2600 Pitfall.png|thumbnail|right|Activision's ''[[Pitfall!]]'', the console's most popular third-party game.]]\nThe 2600's video hardware is therefore highly flexible, but also challenging to program. One advantage the 2600 has over more powerful contemporary competitors such as the [[ColecoVision]] is that the 2600 has no protection against altering settings in mid-line. For example, although each sprite nominally has only one color, it is possible to color the rows differently by changing the sprite's color as it is drawn. If the two hardware sprites are not enough for a game, a developer may share one sprite among several objects (as with the ghosts in ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Pac-Man]]'') or draw software sprites, which is only a little more difficult than drawing a fixed playfield. The ''[[Pitfall!]]'' screenshot demonstrates some of these tricks: the player is a multi-color sprite, one sprite is multiplexed for the logs and the scorpion, and the swinging vine is drawn by shifting the position of the \"ball\" on each scan line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014632/Classic-Game-Postmortem-PITFALL|title=GDC 2011 Panel: Pitfall Classic Postmortem With David Crane |publisher=GDC Vault|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref> [[Warren Robinett]], the programmer for ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'', described numerous tricks that he had to do to complete Adventure to both fit it within the memory limitations of the Atari 2600, as well as creatively use the graphics capability to create a multi-screen maze for players to navigate, using the \"missile\" sprite to create the maze's walls.{{sfn|Bogost, Montfort|2009|p=52|ref=Beam}}\n\nAtari established their system design in order to be compatible with the cathode-ray tube television sets in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Game theories, technologies and techniques of play|last = Arceneaux, Noah|date = 2015|journal = sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermission.nav|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> The Atari 2600 uses different color palettes depending on the television signal format used.<ref name=\"TIA color chart\">Atari 2600 [http://www.biglist.com/lists/stella/archives/200109/msg00285.html \"TIA color chart\"] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wRXhh2Zn?url=http://www.biglist.com/lists/stella/archives/200109/msg00285.html |date=February 12, 2011 }}.</ref> With the [[NTSC]] format, a 128-color palette is available,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://yearofcodes.tumblr.com/what-is-rgb | title=What is RGB colour? | accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref> while in [[PAL]], only 104 colors are available.<ref name=\"TIA color chart\"/> Additionally, the [[SECAM]] palette consists of only 8 colors.<ref name=\"TIA color chart\"/>\n\nA side effect of how graphics work on the 2600 is that all games are required to run at either 60 frames per second (NTSC) or 50 frames per second (PAL).\n\n===Controllers===\n[[File:Atari-2600-Joystick.jpg|thumb|upright|Standard CX10 joystick]]\nThe VCS originally shipped with two types of controllers: a joystick (part number CX10) and pair of rotary paddle controllers (CX30).

The 5200's controllers have an analog [[joystick]] and a [[numeric keypad]] along with start, pause, and reset buttons. The 360-degree non-centering joystick was touted as offering more control than the eight-way joystick controller offered with the Atari 2600.\n\nOn May 21, 1984, during a press conference at which the [[Atari 7800]] was introduced, company executives revealed that the 5200 had been discontinued after just two years on the market.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Sanger | first=David E. | journal=New York Times | title=Atari Video Game Unit Introduced | page=3 (Section D) | date=May 22, 1984 | quote=Company officials disclosed for the first time yesterday that the 5200 is no longer in production, and Atari appears to be selling off its inventory. }}</ref> Total sales of the 5200 were reportedly in excess of 1&nbsp;million units.<ref name=\"schrage1984\"/>\n\n==Hardware==\n[[File:Atari-5200-4-Port-Console-Open-wControllers.jpg|thumb|The 5200's large size is due in part to controller storage in the back of the unit.]]\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2014}}\nMuch of the technology in the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of [[home computer]] systems was originally developed as a second-generation games console intended to replace the [[Atari 2600|2600]]. However, as the system was reaching completion, the personal computer revolution was starting with the release of machines like the [[Commodore PET]], [[TRS-80]] and [[Apple II]]. These machines had less advanced hardware than the new Atari technology, but sold for much higher prices with associated higher profit margins. Atari's management decided to enter this market, and the technology was repackaged into the [[Atari 400]] and [[Atari 800|800]]. The chipset used in these machines was created with the mindset that the [[Atari 2600|2600]] would likely be obsolete by the 1980 time frame.\n\nAtari later decided to re-enter the games market with a design that closely matched their original 1978 specifications. In its prototype stage, the Atari 5200 was originally called the \"Atari Video System X \u2013 Advanced Video Computer System\", and was codenamed \"Pam\" after a female employee at [[Atari, Inc.]] It is also rumored that PAM actually stood for \"Personal Arcade Machine\", as the majority of games for the system ended up being arcade conversions. Actual working ''Atari Video System X'' machines, whose hardware is 100% identical to the Atari 5200 do exist, but are extremely rare.<ref name=\"vsx\">{{cite web|author=Curt Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/vsx.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130117121835/http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/vsx.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |title=Video System X |publisher=Atarimuseum.com |date= |accessdate=January 12, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe initial 1982 release of the system featured four controller ports, where nearly all other systems of the day had only one or two ports. The 5200 also featured a new style of controller with an analog [[joystick]], numeric keypad, two fire buttons on each side of the controller and game function keys for Start, Pause, and Reset. The 5200 also featured the innovation of the first automatic TV switchbox, allowing it to automatically switch from regular TV viewing to the game system signal when the system was activated. Previous RF adapters required the user to slide a switch on the adapter by hand. The [[radio frequency|RF]] box was also where the power supply connected in a unique dual power/television signal setup similar to the [[RCA Studio II]]'s. A single cable coming out of the 5200 plugged into the switch box and was used for both electricity and the television signal.\n\n[[File:Atari-5200-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|The second revision of the 5200]]\nThe 1983 revision of the Atari 5200 has two controller ports instead of four, and a change back to the more conventional separate power supply and standard non-autoswitching RF switch. It also has changes in the cartridge port address lines to allow for the [[Atari 2600]] adapter released that year. While the adapter was only made to work on the two-port version, modifications can be made to the four-port to make it line-compatible. In fact, towards the end of the four-port model's production run, there were a limited number of consoles produced which included these modifications. These consoles can be identified by an asterisk in their serial numbers.\n\n===Controllers===\n[[File:Atari-5200-Controller.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The Atari 5200 controller]]The controller prototypes used in the electrical development lab employed a yoke and gimbal mechanism that came from an RC airplane controller kit. The design of the [[analog stick|analog joystick]], which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to provide centering, proved to be ungainly and unreliable. They quickly became the [[Achilles' heel]] of the system because of their combination of an overly complex mechanical design with a very low-cost internal flex circuit system.<ref name=\"atarimuseum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/A5200.html |title=The Atari 5200 Super System |publisher=atarimuseum.com |accessdate=July 6, 2014 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not translate into a linear acceleration from the center through the arc of the stick travel.

The system was designed in 1983-1984 with an intended mass market rollout in June of '84, but was canceled shortly thereafter due to the sale of the company to [[Jack Tramiel|Tramel Technology Ltd]] on July 2, 1984. The project was originally called the Atari 3600, though was later renamed the Atari 7800.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/7800/7800menu/ |title=The Atari 7800 ProSystem |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130117172550/http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/7800/7800menu/ |archivedate=2013-01-17 }}</ref>\n\nAtari had been facing mounting pressure in the form of competition from the [[ColecoVision]], which boasted graphics that more closely mirrored [[arcade game]]s of the time than Atari\u2019s 2600 system. At the same time, the Atari 5200 (the original intended successor to the Atari 2600) had been widely criticized for not being able to play Atari 2600 games without an adapter.\n\nGCC had a background in creating arcade games and designed their new system with a graphical architecture similar to arcade machines of the time. The 7800 allows a large number of moving objects (75 to 100).  Powering the system is a slightly customized  6502 processor, the Atari SALLY (sometimes described as a \"6502C\"),<ref name=\"EGM62\">{{cite news|last= |first= |title=When Pac Ruled the Earth|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=62|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=September 1994|page=18}}</ref> running at 1.79&nbsp;MHz.

Modern publications have often incorrectly asserted that Jack Tramiel mothballed the Atari 7800, feeling video games were a past fad, and subsequently asserted that he dusted off the Atari 7800 once the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] became successful. The reality was that a contractual issue arose in that GCC had not been paid for their development of the 7800. Warner and Tramiel battled back and forth over who was accountable, with Tramiel believing that the 7800 should have been covered as part of his acquisition deal. In May 1985, Jack relented and paid GCC the overdue payment. This led to additional negotiations regarding the initial launch titles that GCC had developed and then an effort to find someone to lead their new video game division, which was completed in November 1985.<ref>[Retrogamer Magazine, Issue #78, pp 57]</ref>\n\nThe original production run of the Atari 7800 languished on warehouse shelves until it was re-introduced in January 1986, after strong 2600 sales the previous Christmas.<ref>[http://tnca.myrmid.com/art9.htm Atari, Sega, and Nintendo Plan Comeback for Video Games - HFD: The Weekly Home Furnishings Newspaper]</ref> The console was released nationwide in May 1986 for $79.95.<ref name=\"CE2\"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Atari's \"Jr Pac-Man\" scores for looks, sound|last=Semrad|first=Edward|date=1986-06-26|work=The Milwaukee Journal|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAtari's launch of the 7800 under Tramiel was far more subdued than Warner had planned for the system in 1984 with a marketing budget of just $300,000.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20050309231257/http://www.icwhen.com/book/the_1980s/1986.shtml</ref> Additionally, the keyboard and high score cartridge were canceled, the expansion port was removed from later production runs of the system and, in lieu of new titles, the system was launched with titles intended for the 7800's debut in 1984.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nBy the end of 1986, Computer Entertainer claimed the Atari 7800 had sold 100,000 consoles in the United States,<ref name=\"CE2\">''Computer Entertainer'', February 1987, [http://i.imgur.com/eUXac6M.jpg page 13]</ref><ref name=\"CE1\">''Computer Entertainer'', December 1986, [http://i.imgur.com/fyarkYE.jpg page 8]</ref> less than the [[Sega Master System]]'s 125,000 and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]'s 1.1 million.<ref name=\"CE2\"/> According to Atari, due to manufacturing problems, it only managed to produce and sell 100,000 units by 1986, including units that had been in a warehouse since 1984.

When Nintendo entered the industry, it signed up software development companies to create [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) games under a strict license agreement which imposed serious restrictions on what they were allowed to do. One of the key clauses was that companies who made Nintendo games were not allowed to make that game on a competing system for a period of two years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Game Over |last=Sheff |first=David |authorlink=David Sheff |year=1993 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-679-40469-4 |pages=214\u2013215}}</ref> Because of the market success of the NES, companies chose to develop for it first and were thus barred from developing the same games on competing systems for two years. The software libraries of the Atari 7800 and Sega Master System suffered tremendously as a result.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nEleven titles were developed and sold by three third-party companies under their own labels for the 7800 ([[Absolute Entertainment]], [[Activision]], and [[Froggo]]) with the rest published by Atari themselves. However, most Atari development was contracted out.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jung|first1=Robert A.|title=The Atari Timeline|url=https://www.landley.net/history/mirror/atari/museum/Atari-Timeline.html|website=Landley|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome NES titles were developed by companies who had licensed their title from a different arcade manufacturer. While the creator of the NES version would be restricted from making a competitive version of an NES game, the original arcade copyright holder was not precluded from licensing out rights for a home version of an arcade game to multiple systems. Through this loophole, Atari 7800 conversions of ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Double Dragon]]'', ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'', ''[[Rampage (video game)|Rampage]]'', ''[[Xenophobe (video game)|Xenophobe]]'', ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'', and ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' were licensed and developed.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n=== Discontinuation ===\nThe Atari 7800 remained officially active in the United States between 1986 and 1991 and in Europe between 1989 and 1991. On January 1, 1992, Atari Corp. formally announced that production of the Atari 7800, the Atari 2600, the Atari 8-bit computer line, and the Atari XE Game System would cease. (It has since been discovered that Atari Corp. continued to develop games such as ''[[Toki (video game)|Toki]]'' for the Atari 7800 until all development was shut down in May 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://betaphasegames.com/7800_Toki_Screens.html|title=TOKI FOR 7800: DISCOVERY ANNOUNCEMENT|website=Beta Phase Games|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref>) By the time of the cancellation, Nintendo's NES dominated the North American market, controlling 80% while Atari Corp. controlled just 12%.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DD143EF935A25756C0A964958260 | work=The New York Times | title=COMPANY NEWS; Nintendo Suit by Atari Is Dismissed | date=May 16, 1992 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDespite trailing the Nintendo Entertainment System in terms of number of units sold, the 7800 was a profitable enterprise for Atari Corp., benefiting largely from Atari\u2019s name and the system's 2600 compatibility.

Instead of a limited number of hardware sprites, MARIA allows for a much larger number of sprites described in a series of [[display list]]s. Each display list contains sprite entries with pointers to graphics data, color information, and horizontal positioning. The same display list is used for multiple rasters with the pointers being automatically adjusted. However, managing and displaying a large number of sprites required much more [[CPU]] time (both directly and indirectly since the MARIA would halt the CPU when drawing sprites) than consoles with hardware sprites and backgrounds.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nMARIA has a number of different graphics modes which are either 160 pixels wide or 320 pixels wide. While the 320 pixel modes theoretically enable the 7800 to create games at higher resolution than the 256 pixel wide graphics found in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Sega Master System]], the intense processing demands of MARIA typically meant that programmers created their games using the lower 160 pixel modes.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe 7800 features a broad (for its time) palette of 256 colors. Many consoles are calibrated so that hue 1 and hue F are the same, effectively eliminating 16 colors (reducing the effective total to 240 colors), but calibration drift, warmup drift, and differences in calibration practices can push hue F away from hue 1, resulting in noticeable palette issues for some games when using colors in hues E and F.<ref name=\"rgb\">{{cite web|title=RGB|url=https://sites.google.com/site/atari7800wiki/rgb|website=Atari 7800 Programming}}</ref><ref name=\"color_doc\">{{cite web|title=Atari 7800 Color Documentation|url=http://7800.8bitdev.org/index.php/Atari_7800_Color_Documentation|website=Atari 7800 Development Wiki}}</ref>\n\nDepending on various parameters, each individual sprite can use from 1 to 12 colors, with 3 colors (plus a 4th \"transparency\" color) being the most common. In this format, the sprite is referenced to one of 8 palettes, where each palette holds 3 assignable colors. There is also an assignable background color, which will be visible wherever another object has not covered it up. In total the system can utilize 25 colors on a scanline at one time.<ref name=\"atarimuseum.com\">http://www.atarimuseum.com/ahs_archives/archives/archives-techdocs-7800.htm{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe graphics resolution, color palette assignments, and background color can be adjusted in between scanlines. This technique is documented in the original 1983 \"Atari 3600 Software Guide\".<ref name=\"atarimuseum.com\"/> Games often used this feature to render high resolution text in one area of the screen, while displaying more colorful graphics with less resolution in the gameplay area. Demos also exist which use this feature to place all 256 colors on the screen at the same time.\n\nThe MARIA\u2019s approach had advantages and disadvantages when it came to generating graphics in software during the lifespan of the 7800. It excelled at moving around large numbers of sprites on a static screen without the screen flickering that plagued other 8-bit systems. Its flexible design enabled it to play games which used display list manipulation to generate a pseudo 3D appearance such as ''[[Ballblazer]]'' (1987) and ''F-18 Hornet'' (1988). While side-scrolling games in the vein of ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' are possible on the system (1990's ''Scrapyard Dog'' is the best example), it is significantly harder to develop such a title than on a tile-based system such as the Nintendo Entertainment System.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n=== Sound ===\n\nA common criticism of the 7800 regards its use of the TIA to provide 2-channel sound effects and music, resulting in sound quality that is virtually identical to the Atari 2600 VCS from 1977. While the inclusion of 2600 hardware is required to maintain compatibility with the older system, this drove up production costs and reduced available space on the 7800\u2019s motherboard. As such, the 7800 does not include additional hardware for generating sound as it does with graphics and the sound hardware is considered the weakest part of the system.\n\nTo compensate for this, GCC\u2019s engineers allowed games to include a [[Atari POKEY|POKEY audio chip]] in the cartridge which substantially improved the audio quality. To ensure software developers had an economical means of producing better sound than TIA, GCC had originally planned to make a low-cost, high performance sound chip, GUMBY, which could also be placed in 7800 cartridges to enhance its sound capabilities further. This project was cancelled when Atari was sold to Jack Tramiel.\n\nDespite having the capability to support sound chips in cartridges, almost no 7800 cartridges feature POKEY hardware for enhanced sound. ''Ballblazer'', released in 1987, uses the POKEY to generate all music and sound effects. Similarly, ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'', released in 1989, uses a POKEY to generate in-game music while the TIA generates the game's sound effects for a total of 6 channels of sound.\n\n=== Lockout features ===\nFollowing the debate over ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'', an Atari 2600 VCS title with adult themes, Atari had concerns over similar adult titles finding their way onto the 7800 and displaying adult content using the significantly improved graphics capabilities of the MARIA chip. To combat this, they included a digital signature protection method which prevented unauthorized 7800 games from being played on the system.\n\nWhen a cartridge was inserted into the system, the 7800 BIOS included code which would generate a digital signature of the cartridge ROM and compare it to the signature stored on the cartridge. If a correct signature was located on the cartridge, the 7800 would operate in 7800 mode, granting the game access to MARIA and other features. If a signature was not located, the 7800 remained in 2600 mode and MARIA was unavailable. All 7800 games released in North America had to be digitally signed by Atari. This digital signature code is not present in PAL 7800s, which use various heuristics to detect 2600 cartridges, due to export restrictions. The signing utility was found and released by Classic Gaming Expo in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|last=Boris|first=Dan|title=The Encryption Issue|url=http://atarihq.com/danb/a7800.shtml#encryption|work=Atari 7800 Tech Page|accessdate=2 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Backward compatibility ===\nThe Atari 7800 differs from the 2600 in several key areas. It features a full Atari SALLY 6502 processor whereas the 2600 VCS has a stripped-down 6507 processor running at a slower speed. It has additional [[RAM]] (Random Access Memory) and the ability to access more cartridge data at one time than the 2600. The most substantial difference, however, is a graphics architecture which differs markedly from either the Atari 2600 VCS or Atari\u2019s 8-bit line of computers.\n\nThe 7800's compatibility with the Atari 2600 is made possible by including many of the same chips used in the Atari 2600. When operating in \u201c2600\u201d mode to play Atari 2600 titles, the 7800 uses a Television Interface Adapter (TIA) chip to generate graphics and sound. The processor is slowed to 1.19&nbsp;MHz, enabling the 7800 to mirror the performance of the 2600's 6507 processor. RAM is limited to 128 bytes found in the RIOT and game data is accessed in 4K blocks.\n\nWhen in \u201c7800\u201d mode (signified by the appearance of the full-screen Atari logo), the graphics are generated entirely by the MARIA graphics processing unit, all system RAM is available and game data is accessed in larger 48K blocks. The system\u2019s SALLY 6502 runs at its normal 1.79&nbsp;MHz instead of the reduced speed of 2600 mode. The 2600 chips are used in 7800 mode to generate sound and to provide the interfaces to the controllers and console switches.\n\nThe Atari 7800 does not support backward compatibility for Atari 5200 games or accessories.\n\n===System revisions===\nPrototypes:\n* Atari 3600, original model number\n* Atari CX-9000 Video Computer System\n\nProduction:\n* Atari CX7800, two joystick ports on lower front panel. Side expansion port for upgrades and add-ons. Bundled accessories included two CX24 Pro-Line joysticks, AC adapter, switchbox, RCA connecting cable, and [[Pole Position II]] cartridge.\n* Atari CX7800, second revision. Slightly revised motherboard, added an additional timing circuit. Expansion port connector removed from motherboard but is still etched. Shell has indentation of where expansion port was to be.\n* Atari CX7800, third revision. Same as above but with only a small blemish on the shell where the expansion port was.\n\n== Peripherals ==\n[[File:Atari-CX78-7800-Controller-FL-wThumbStick.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[gamepad]] of the Atari 7800 with the thumbstick screwed in.]]\nThe Atari 7800 came bundled with the Atari Proline Joystick, a two button controller with a [[joystick]] for movement. In response to criticism over ergonomic issues in the 7800\u2019s Pro-Line controllers, Atari later released joypad controllers with European 7800s, which were similar in style to controllers found on Nintendo and Sega Systems. The Joypad was not available in the United States.\n\nThere were few add-on peripherals for the 7800, though its backwards compatibility feature allowed it to use most Atari 2600 peripherals. The XG-1 lightgun, which came bundled with the [[Atari XEGS]], was sold separately for other Atari systems and was fully compatible with the 7800. Atari released five 7800 light gun games: ''[[Alien Brigade]]'', ''Barnyard Blaster'', ''[[Crossbow (video game)|Crossbow]]'', ''Meltdown'' and ''Sentinel''.\n\n=== Canceled peripherals ===\nAfter the acquisition of the Atari Consumer Division by [[Jack Tramiel]] in 1984, a number of planned peripherals for the system were canceled.\n\n* The High Score Cartridge was designed to save player high scores for up to 65 separate games. The cartridge was intended as a pass-through device (similar to the later [[Game Genie]]). Nine games were programmed with the feature but the cartridge was canceled before it was released. In 1999, a limited run of cartridges were produced by Atari historian Curt Vendel using ROM code from Gary Rubio (the former Atari liaison to GCC on the Atari 7800 project). This feature has been included in many homebrew releases in recent years.\n* The 7800 included an expansion port which would have allowed for the addition of a planned computer keyboard, connection to laserdisc players and other peripherals. The expansion port was removed in the second and third revisions of the 7800.{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n* A dual joystick holder was designed for games like ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'' and future games like ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' and others, but not produced.<ref>http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/</ref>\n\n== Software library ==\n{{Main|List of Atari 7800 games|List of Atari 2600 games}}\n[[File:Atari 7800 with Cartridge.jpg|thumb|Atari 7800 with \"Donkey Kong Junior\" cartridge]]\n\nWhile the 7800 can actually play hundreds of titles due to its compatibility with the Atari 2600, there was limited third party support for the 7800 and fewer than 100 titles were specifically designed for it.\n\n===Source code release===\nThe source code for 13 games, as well as the OS and development tools (for the [[Atari ST]] computer system) were discovered in a dumpster behind the Atari building in Sunnyvale, California.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120720124624/http://www.atarimuseum.com/whatsnew/2009-JUN-11.html AtariMuseum - Site News: June 11, 2009], retrieved July 3, 2009</ref> Commented [[assembly language]] source code was made available for ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', ''Commando'', ''Crossbow'', ''Desert Falcon'', ''[[Dig Dug]]'', ''[[Food Fight (video game)|Food Fight]]'', ''[[Galaga]]'', ''[[Hat Trick (video game)|Hat Trick]]'', ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'', ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'', ''Super Stunt Cycle'', ''Robotron: 2084'' and ''[[Xevious]]'' game titles.<ref>[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090706155155/http://www.atarimuseum.com//videogames//consoles//7800//games// \"7800 Games & Development\"] at [https://archive.is/20120722141847/http://www.atarimuseum.com/ The Atari History Museum website], retrieved July 3, 2009</ref>\n\n== Emulation and homebrew ==\nWhen emulators of 1980s video game consoles began to appear on home computers in the late 1990s, the Atari 7800 was one of the last to be emulated. The lack of awareness of the system, the lack of understanding of the hardware, and fears about the digital signature lockout initially caused concerns. Since that time, however, the 7800 has been emulated successfully and is now common on emulation sites. One such program is ProSystem, written in C/C++ for the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.<ref>{{cite book| last1         = Kohler| first1        = Chris| others        = foreword by [[Al Lowe]]| title         = Retro Gaming Hacks| edition       = 1st| date          = 2005-10-12| publisher     = [[O'Reilly Media]]| location      = Sebastopol, CA| isbn          = 0-596-00917-8| pages         = 156&nbsp;\u2013  157|chapter       = Playing Classic Console Games}}</ref> It uses the Windows API and DirectX to display what it emulates in both [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]].\n\nThe digital signature long prevented homebrew games from being developed until the original encryption generating software was discovered. When the original digital signature generating software was turned over to the Atari community, development of new Atari 7800 titles began. In addition, the Atari community has slowly uncovered the original 7800 development tools and released them into the public domain. New tools, documentation, source code and utilities for development have since been created which has sponsored additional homebrew development. Several new commercial Atari 7800 titles such as ''Beef Drop'', ''B*nQ'', ''Pac-Man Collection'', ''Combat 1990'', ''Santa Simon'', and ''Space War'' have been created and released.\n\n== Atari Flashback ==\nIn 2004, Atari (now owned by [[Infogrames Entertainment, SA|Infogrames]]) released the first [[Atari Flashback]] console. This system resembled a miniature Atari 7800 and joysticks and had 20 built in games (five 7800 and fifteen 2600 titles). While the unit sold well, it was controversial among Atari fans. Atari had given the engineering firm, Legacy Engineering, extremely limited development timelines. The firm was forced to build the Flashback using [[Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clone|NES-On-A-Chip]] hardware instead of recreating the Atari 7800 hardware. As a result, the Flashback has been criticized for failing to properly replicate the actual Atari gaming experience.\n\nLegacy Engineering was later commissioned to create another 7800 project that was subsequently cancelled after prototypes were made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacyengineer.com/portfolio-7800.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311035331/http://www.legacyengineer.com/portfolio-7800.html |archivedate=2011-03-11 |df= }} Legacy 7800 remade</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Atari]]\n* [[List of Atari 7800 games]]\n* [[List of Atari 2600 games]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Atari 7800}}\n* [http://www.atariage.com/software_search.html?SystemID=7800 AtariAge &ndash; Comprehensive Atari 7800 database and information]\n* [http://www.atari7800.org Atari 7800 Information & Resources]\n* [http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/7800/7800menu/ Atari Museum &ndash; History of the Atari 7800 ProSystem]\n* [http://7800.8bitdev.org/ Atari 7800 Development Wiki]\n\n{{Atari hardware}}\n{{Third generation game consoles}}\n{{Home video game consoles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Atari 7800}}\n[[Category:Atari consoles|7800]]\n[[Category:Home video game consoles]]\n[[Category:Backward-compatible video game consoles]]\n[[Category:Third-generation video game consoles]]\n[[Category:1986 in video gaming]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1986]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Products and services discontinued in 1992]]\n[[Category:1980s toys]]", "sha1": "d1emrj77t2g4kt3ez0i9p4y0fiikto3"}}, {"title": "Atari Jaguar", "ns": "0", "id": "2782", "revision": {"id": "865891888", "parentid": "864432132", "timestamp": "2018-10-26T21:15:26Z", "contributor": {"username": "InternetArchiveBot", "id": "27015025"}, "comment": "Rescuing 1 sources and tagging 0 as dead. #IABot (v2.0beta9)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use American English|date=May 2015}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2015}}\n{{Infobox information appliance\n| title        = Atari Jaguar\n| logo         = Jaguar Logo.png\n| image        = Atari-Jaguar-Console-Set.jpg\n| caption      = Atari Jaguar with the standard controller\n| developer    = [[Atari Corporation]]\n| manufacturer = [[IBM]]\n| type         = [[Home video game console]]\n| generation   = [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|Fifth generation]]\n| releasedate  = {{vgrelease|NA|November 23, 1993<ref name=\"Jaguar_NA_RD\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ATARI+SHIPS+JAGUAR+FOR+NEW+YORK+AND+SAN+FRANCISCO+MARKETS%3b+WORLD%27S...-a014659911|title=ATARI SHIPS JAGUAR FOR NEW YORK AND SAN FRANCISCO MARKETS; WORLD'S FIRST 64-BIT INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM AVAILABLE|publisher=''[[PR Newswire]]''|date=November 23, 1993|accessdate=May 10, 2011}}</ref>}}{{vgrelease|EU|June 27, 1994}}{{vgrelease|AU|August 1, 1994<ref name=\"Hjrb?\">{{cite magazine|last=Humphreys|first=Andrew|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:Hyper_AU_009.pdf&page=20|title=Jaguar - Reality Bites?|magazine=[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]|publisher=[[nextmedia|Next Media Pty Ltd]]|issue=9|date=August 1994|pages=20-25}}</ref>}}{{vgrelease|DE|September 1, 1994<ref name=\"VGjid\">{{cite magazine|author=Euer Video Games Team|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:VideoGames_DE_1994-09.pdf&page=36|title=Warpzone - Jaguar - Jaguar in Deutschland!|magazine=[[:de:Video Games|Video Games]]|issue=34|publisher=Future-Verlag|date=September 1994|page=38}}</ref>}}{{vgrelease|JP|December 8, 1994<ref name=\"MFngbj\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AMegaFun_DE_1995-03.pdf&page=28|title=Scene - Next Generation Battle - Japan|magazine=[[:de:Mega Fun|Mega Fun]]|issue=30|publisher=CT Computec Verlag GmbH & Co.

The console is the sixth programmable console to be developed under the [[Atari]] brand, originally released in North America in November 1993. It is also the last Atari console to use physical media. Controversially, Atari marketed the Jaguar as being the first [[64-bit]] video game console,<ref name=\"Jaguar_NA_RD\"/> while competing with the existing 16-bit consoles ([[Sega Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]) and the 32-bit [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] platform (which launched the same year).\n\nDevelopment on the Atari Jaguar started in the early 1990s by [[Flare Technology]]. The console was released to test markets in [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]] in November 1993 and to the general public in 1994. The Jaguar shipped with ''[[Cybermorph]]'' as the [[pack-in game|pack-in]] game.<ref>http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/history.html</ref>\n\nThe multi-chip architecture, hardware bugs, and lacking developer support tools made game development difficult. Underwhelming sales further contributed to the console's lack of third-party support. This, in addition to the lack of internal development at Atari, led to a games library comprising only 56 licensed titles.<ref>http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/history.html</ref>\n\nAtari attempted to extend the lifespan of the system with the [[Atari Jaguar CD]] [[Video game accessory|add-on]] and marketing the Jaguar as the low-cost next generation console, with a price tag over $100 less than any of its competitors.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Once and Future Kings|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=80|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|pages=28\u201330}}</ref> With the release of the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] in 1995, sales of the Jaguar continued to fall, ultimately selling no more than 250,000 units before it was discontinued in 1996. The [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]] of the Jaguar prompted Atari to leave the video game console market.\n\nAfter [[Hasbro Interactive]] bought out Atari in the late 1990s, the patents to the Jaguar were released into the [[public domain]], with the console being declared an open platform.<ref name=\"hasbro\"/> Since then, the Jaguar has gained a cult following, with a developer base that produces [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew games]] for the console.<ref name=\"redundant\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Development===\nThe Jaguar was developed by the members of [[Flare Technology]], a company formed by [[Martin Brennan (engineer)|Martin Brennan]] and [[John Mathieson (computer scientist)|John Mathieson]]. The team had claimed that they could not only make a console superior to the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] or the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], but they could also be cost-effective.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Impressed by their work on the [[Konix Multisystem]], Atari persuaded them to close Flare and form a new company called [[Flare Technology|Flare II]], with Atari providing the funding.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Flare II initially set to work designing two consoles for Atari Corp. One was a 32-bit architecture (codenamed \"[[Atari Panther|Panther]]\"), and the other was a 64-bit system (codenamed \"Jaguar\"); however, work on the Jaguar design progressed faster than expected, so Atari Corp. canceled the Panther project to focus on the more promising Jaguar.\n\nThe Jaguar was unveiled in August 1993 at the Chicago Consumer Entertainment Show.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Atari: From Boom to Bust and Back Again |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=4|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=April 1995|page=39}}</ref>\n\n===Launch===\nThe Jaguar was introduced in 1993 at a price of $249.99,<ref name=\"gamepro\" /> under a $500 million manufacturing deal with [[IBM]]. The system was initially available only in the [[test market]]s of [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]], under the slogan \"Do the Math\",<ref name=\"gamepro\"/> claiming superiority over competing 16-bit and 32-bit systems.

Other early releases like ''[[Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy]]'', ''[[Raiden (video game)|Raiden]]'', and ''[[Evolution: Dino Dudes]]'' also received poor reviews, the latter two for failing to take full advantage of the Jaguar's hardware.

It was the world's first [[handheld electronic game]] with a [[color]] [[LCD]]. It was also notable for its advanced graphics and [[ambidextrous]] layout. The Lynx competed with the [[Game Boy]] (released two months earlier), as well as the [[Game Gear]] and [[TurboExpress]], both released the following year. It was discontinued in 1996.\n\n==History==\nThe Lynx was the second handheld game system to be released with the Atari name. The first was Atari Inc.'s [[handheld electronic game]] ''[[Touch Me (arcade game)|Touch Me]]''. Atari Inc. had previously worked on several other handheld projects including the ''[[Breakout (arcade game)|Breakout]]'', ''[[Space Invaders]]'', and the [[Atari Cosmos]] portable/tabletop console. However, those projects were shut down during development, some just short of their intended commercial release.\n\nThe Lynx system was originally developed by [[Epyx]] as the '''Handy Game'''. In 1986, two former [[Amiga]] designers, [[R. J. Mical]] and [[Dave Needle]], had been asked by former manager at Amiga, David Morse, if they could come up with a design for a portable gaming system.<ref name= \"EGM1989\"/><ref name=\"Wired\">{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=Steven |date= |title=Third Time's a Charm (They Hope) |url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.01/3do_pr.html |journal=Wired |location=United States |publisher=Conde Nast |accessdate=June 17, 2014 }}</ref> Morse now worked at Epyx, a game software company that had a recent string of hit games. Morse's son had asked him if he could make a portable gaming system, prompting the lunch with Mical and Needle to discuss the idea. Morse convinced Mical and Needle to develop the idea and they were hired by Epyx to be a part of the design team.<ref name=\"EGM1989\"/> Planning and design of the console began in 1986 and was completed in 1987.<ref name=\"retrogamer#4\">{{cite journal |author=Peter Latimer |date=July 2005 |title=Atari Lynx |journal=Retro Gamer |issue=4 |pages=Pages 24\u201331 |issn=1742-3155 }}</ref> Epyx first showed the Handy system at the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in January 1989.<ref name=\"EGM1989\">{{cite journal|last=Jermaine |first=John |date=November 1989 |title=Lynx, an interview with the men behind the machine |url=http://ataritimes.com/index.php?ArticleIDX=370 |journal=Electronic Gaming Monthly |location=United States |publisher=Sendai Publications |accessdate=June 17, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916114505/http://ataritimes.com/index.php?ArticleIDX=370 |archivedate=September 16, 2014 }}</ref> Facing financial difficulties, Epyx sought out partners.

The first generation of cartridges were flat, and were designed to be stackable for ease of storage. However, this design proved to be very difficult to remove from the console and was replaced by a second design. This style, called \"tabbed\" or \"ridged\", used the same basic design as the original cartridges with the addition of two small tabs on the cartridge's underside to aid in removal. The original flat style cartridges could be stacked on top of the newer cartridges, but the newer cartridges could not be easily stacked on each other, nor were they stored easily. Thus a third style, the \"curved lip\" style was produced, and all official and third-party cartridges during the console's lifespan were released (or re-released) using this style.<ref>[http://www.atariage.com/system_labels.html?SystemID=LYNX Atari Lynx] cartridge style illustrations at AtariAge.com.</ref>\n\nIn May 1991, Sega launched its Game Gear portable gaming handheld. Also a color handheld, in comparison to the Lynx it had a higher cost and shorter battery life (3\u20134 hours as opposed to 4-5 for the Lynx), but it was slightly smaller and was backed up by significantly more games. Retailers such as [[Game (retailer)|Game]] and Toys R Us continued to sell the Lynx well into the mid-1990s on the back of the [[Atari Jaguar]] launch, helped by magazines such as ''Ultimate Future Games'' who continued to cover the Lynx alongside the new generation of 32-bit and 64-bit consoles.\n\n===Lynx II===\n[[File:Atari-Lynx-II-Handheld-Angled.jpg|right|thumb|The Atari Lynx II, smaller and lighter than the original]]\nDuring 1990, the Lynx had moderate sales. In July 1991, Atari Corporation introduced the Lynx II with a new marketing campaign, new packaging, slightly improved hardware, better battery life and a new sleeker look. The new system (referred to within Atari as the \"Lynx II\") featured rubber hand grips and a clearer backlit color screen with a power save option (which turned off the LCD panel's backlighting). It also replaced the monaural headphone jack of the original Lynx with one wired for stereo. The new packaging made the Lynx available without any accessories, dropping the price to $99. Although sales improved, Nintendo still dominated the handheld market.\n\nIn 1995, Atari started shifting its focus away from the Lynx and put more focus on the [[Atari Jaguar]]. A handful of games were released during this time, including ''Battlezone 2000''. In 1996, Atari shut down its internal game development.\n\n==Features==\n[[File:Todd's Adventures in Slime World cover art (Atari Lynx).jpg|thumb|right|150px]]\nThe Atari Lynx's innovative features include being the first color handheld, with a backlit display, a switchable right-handed/left-handed (upside down) configuration, and the ability to network with up to 15 other units via its Comlynx system (though most games would network eight or fewer players). Comlynx was originally developed to run over infrared links (and was codenamed RedEye).<ref name=\"retrogramer164\">{{cite journal |title=Todd's Adventures in Slime World |journal=Retro Gamer Magazine |volume= |issue=164 |pages=74 |access-date=26 February 2018 }}</ref> This was changed to a cable-based networking system before the final release. According to Peter Engelbrite, when players walked through the beam, the link would be interrupted. The maximum stable connection allowed was eight players.<ref name=\"retrogramer164\" /> Engelbrite also developed the first recordable eight-player co-op game, and the only eight-player game for the Atari Lynx, ''[[Todd's Adventures in Slime World]]'', using the Comlynx system. Each Lynx needed a copy of the game, and one cable could connect two machines. The cables could be connected into a chain.\n\n{{quote box \n| quote=\"The leading-edge display was the most expensive component, so the colour choice was one of economy.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]], among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the [[Just war theory|theories of just war]]. However, there is no consensus on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.<ref name=fischer1954/>\n\n===Self-defence, criminal law, and war===\nThe classical texts of Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment.<ref name=balkaran2012/><ref name=klos1996>[[Klaus K. Klostermaier]] (1996), in Harvey Leonard Dyck and Peter Brock (Ed), The Pacifist Impulse in Historical Perspective, see ''Chapter on Himsa and Ahimsa Traditions in Hinduism'', {{ISBN|978-0-8020-0777-3}}, University of Toronto Press, pages 230\u2013234</ref> [[Arthashastra]] discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.<ref name=robinson2003>Paul F.

Modern India's Strategic Advantage to the United States: Her Twin Strengths in Himsa and Ahimsa. Comparative Strategy, 27(2), pages 133\u2013147</ref>\n\n;War\nThe precepts of Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force must be the last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its objective to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful.<ref name=balkaran2012/><ref name=robinson2003/> War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction.<ref>Subedi, S. P. (2003). The Concept in Hinduism of 'Just War'. Journal of Conflict and Security Law, 8(2), pages 339\u2013361</ref> All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment.<ref name=robinson2003/> Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.<ref name=balkaran2012/><ref name=klos1996/>\n\n;Self-defence\nIn matters of self-defence, different interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, T\u00e4htinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not protected by the rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures support the use of violence against an armed attacker.<ref>T\u00e4htinen pp. 96, 98\u2013101.</ref><ref>Mahabharata 12.15.55; Manu Smriti 8.349\u2013350; Matsya Purana 226.116.</ref> Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.<ref>T\u00e4htinen pp. 91\u201393.</ref>\n\nAlternate theories of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to theories of just war. [[Aikido]], pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. [[Morihei Ueshiba]], the founder of Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa.<ref>[http://www.sportspa.com.ba/images/dec2011/full/rad8.pdf The Role of Teachers in Martial Arts] Neboj\u0161a Vasic, University of Zenica (2011); Sport SPA Vol. 8, Issue 2: 47\u201351; see page 46, 2nd column</ref> According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume that the world is free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.<ref>[http://aiki-extensions.org/pubs/conflict-body_text.pdf SOCIAL CONFLICT, AGGRESSION, AND THE BODY IN EURO-AMERICAN AND ASIAN SOCIAL THOUGHT] Donald Levine, University of Chicago (2004)</ref><ref>Ueshiba, Kissh\u014dmaru (2004), ''The Art of Aikido: Principles and Essential Techniques'', Kodansha International, {{ISBN|4-7700-2945-4}}</ref>\n\n;Criminal law\nT\u00e4htinen concludes that Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their position is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons.<ref>T\u00e4htinen pp. 96, 98\u201399.</ref>\n\nOther scholars<ref name=klos1996/><ref name=robinson2003/> conclude that the scriptures of Hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair, proportional and not cruel.\n\n;Pacifism\nThere is no consensus on [[pacifism]] among modern Hindu scholars. The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of [[just war]] prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], as being an allegory,<ref>Gandhi, Mohandas K., ''The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi'' Berkeley Hills Books, Berkeley 2000</ref> wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where human's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.<ref name=fischer1954>Fischer, Louis: ''Gandhi: His Life and Message to the World'' Mentor, New York 1954, pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\n===Non-human life===\nThe Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' applies to animals and all life forms.

For example, the ''[[Tirukkural]],'' written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Veda]], is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. The Kural dedicates Chapters 26, 32 and 33 of [[Aram (Kural book)|Book I]] to the virtue of Ahimsa, namely, [[vegetarianism]], [[non-violence|non-harming]], and [[non-killing]], respectively.

Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality.

In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha if it is true that, as she/he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if she/he is killed in battle while her/his mind is seized with the intention to kill, she/he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth.<ref>Bartholomeusz, pp. 125\u2013126.

See also Trevor Ling, ''Buddhism, Imperialism, and War.'' George Allen & Unwin Ltd, 1979, pages 136\u2013137.</ref> One example is the ''Kosala Samyutta'', in which King [[Pasenadi]], a righteous king favored by the Buddha, learns of an impending attack on his kingdom. He arms himself in defence, and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack. He lost this battle but won the war. King Pasenadi eventually defeated King [[Ajatasattu]] and captured him alive. He thought that, although this King of [[Magadha]] has transgressed against his kingdom, he had not transgressed against him personally, and Ajatasattu was still his nephew. He released Ajatasattu and did not harm him.<ref>Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). ''The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya''. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-331-1}}.</ref> Upon his return, the Buddha said (among other things) that Pasenadi \"is a friend of virtue, acquainted with virtue, intimate with virtue\", while the opposite is said of the aggressor, King Ajatasattu.<ref>Bartholomeusz, pp. 49, 52\u201353.</ref>\n\nAccording to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death.<ref>Hammalawa Saddhatissa, ''Buddhist Ethics.'' Wisdom Publications, 1997, pages 60, 159, see also Bartholomeusz page 121.</ref> Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent.<ref>Bartholomeusz, p. 121.</ref> Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.<ref>Bartholomeusz, pp. 44, 121\u2013122, 124.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar]], there is circumstantial evidence encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha's doctrine, ''\"Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any.\"'' Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it as a matter of principle.

Sakharov's study group at FIAN in 1948 came up with a second concept in August\u2013September 1948.<ref name=\":0\">Zaloga, Steve (17 February 2002).

Smithsonian Books. {{ISBN|1588340074}}.</ref> Adding a shell of natural, unenriched uranium around the deuterium would increase the deuterium concentration at the uranium-deuterium boundary and the overall yield of the device, because the natural uranium would capture neutrons and itself fission as part of the thermonuclear reaction. This idea of a layered fission-fusion-fission bomb led Sakharov to call it the sloika, or layered cake.<ref name=\":0\" /> The first Soviet atomic device was tested on August 29, 1949. After moving to [[Sarov]] in 1950, Sakharov played a key role in the development of the first megaton-range Soviet hydrogen bomb using a design known as ''Sakharov's Third Idea'' in Russia and the [[History of the Teller\u2013Ulam design|Teller\u2013Ulam design]] in the United States. Before his ''Third Idea'', Sakharov tried a \"layer cake\" of alternating layers of fission and fusion fuel. The results were disappointing, yielding no more than a typical fission bomb. However the design was seen to be worth pursuing because deuterium is abundant and uranium is scarce, and he had no idea how powerful the US design was. Sakharov realised that in order to cause the explosion of one side of the fuel to symmetrically compress the fusion fuel, a mirror could be used to reflect the radiation. The details had not been officially declassified in Russia when Sakharov was writing his memoirs, but in the Teller\u2013Ulam design, soft X-rays emitted by the fission bomb were focused onto a cylinder of lithium deuteride to compress it symmetrically. This is called [[radiation implosion]]. The Teller\u2013Ulam design also had a secondary fission device inside the fusion cylinder to assist with the compression of the fusion fuel and generate neutrons to convert some of the lithium to tritium, producing a mixture of deuterium and tritium.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sakharov, Andrei|title=Memoirs|publisher=Vintage|date=1992|isbn=067973595X}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Gorelik, Gennady |author2=Bouis, Antonina |title=The world of Andrei Sakharov: a Russian physicist's path to freedom|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019515620X}}</ref> Sakharov's idea was first tested as [[RDS-37]] in 1955. A larger variation of the same design which Sakharov worked on was the 50&nbsp;Mt [[Tsar Bomba]] of October 1961, which was the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated.\n\nSakharov saw \"striking parallels\" between his fate and those of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Edward Teller]] in the US. Sakharov believed that in this \"tragic confrontation of two outstanding people\", both deserved respect, because \"each of them was certain he had right on his side and was morally obligated to go to the end in the name of truth.\" While Sakharov strongly disagreed with Teller over [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear testing in the atmosphere]] and the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], he believed that American academics had been unfair to Teller's resolve to get the H-bomb for the United States since \"all steps by the Americans of a temporary or permanent rejection of developing thermonuclear weapons would have been seen either as a clever feint, or as the manifestation of stupidity. In both cases, the reaction would have been the same \u2013 avoid the trap and immediately take advantage of the enemy's stupidity.\"\n\nSakharov never felt that by creating nuclear weapons he had \"known sin\", in Oppenheimer's expression. He later wrote:\n{{quote|text=After more than forty years, we have had no [[third world war]], and the [[Mutual assured destruction|balance of nuclear terror]]&nbsp;... may have helped to prevent one. But I am not at all sure of this; back then, in those long-gone years, the question didn't even arise.

Politically active during the 1960s, Sakharov was against [[nuclear proliferation]]. Pushing for the end of atmospheric tests, he played a role in the 1963 [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], signed in Moscow.\n\nSakharov was also involved in an event with political consequences in 1964, when the USSR Academy of Sciences nominated for full membership Nikolai Nuzhdin, a follower of [[Trofim Lysenko]] (initiator of the Stalin-supported anti-genetics campaign [[Lysenkoism]]). Contrary to normal practice Sakharov, a member of the Academy, publicly spoke out against full membership for Nuzhdin, holding him responsible for \"the defamation, firing, arrest, even death, of many genuine scientists.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Brezhnev and the Decline of the Soviet Union|last=Crump|first=Thomas|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-66922-6|series=Routledge Studies in the History of Russia and Eastern Europe}}</ref>{{Rp|109}} In the end, Nuzhdin was not elected, but the episode prompted Sergei Khrushchev to order the KGB to gather compromising material on Sakharov.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|109}}\n\nThe major turn in Sakharov's political evolution came in 1967, when [[anti-ballistic missile]] defense became a key issue in US\u2013Soviet relations. In a secret detailed letter to the Soviet leadership of July 21, 1967, Sakharov explained the need to \"take the Americans at their word\" and accept their proposal for a \"bilateral rejection by the USA and the Soviet Union of the development of antiballistic missile defense\", because otherwise an arms race in this new technology would increase the likelihood of nuclear war. He also asked permission to publish his manuscript (which accompanied the letter) in a newspaper to explain the dangers posed by this kind of defense. The government ignored his letter and refused to let him initiate a public discussion of ABMs in the Soviet press.<ref>Gennady Gorelik. The Metamorphosis of Andrei Sakharov.

While Sakharov disagreed with Solzhenitsyn's vision of Russian revival, he deeply respected him for his courage.\n\nSakharov later described that it took \"years\" for him to \"understand how much substitution, deceit, and lack of correspondence with reality there was\" in the Soviet ideals. \"At first I thought, despite everything that I saw with my own eyes, that the Soviet State was a breakthrough into the future, a kind of prototype for all countries\".

In his works he declared that \"the principle '[[Everything which is not forbidden is allowed|what is not prohibited is allowed]]' should be understood literally\", defying what he saw as unwritten ideological rules imposed by the Communist party on the society in spite of a democratic (1936) [[USSR Constitution]].\n\nIn no way did Sakharov consider himself a prophet or the like: \n{{quote\n|text=\"I am no volunteer priest of the idea, but simply a man with an unusual fate. I am against all kinds of self-immolation (for myself and for others, including the people closest to me).\"<ref name=\"people\" /> }}\n\nIn a letter written from exile, he cheered up a fellow physicist and human rights activist with the words: \"Fortunately, the future is unpredictable and also \u2013 because of [[quantum effects]] \u2013 uncertain.\" For Sakharov the indeterminacy of the future supported his belief that he could, and should, take personal responsibility for it.\n\n=== Nobel Peace Prize (1975) ===\nIn 1973, Sakharov was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] and in 1974 was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]].\n\nSakharov was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975.

Carbon is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element]] in the universe and the energy required to make or break a bond is at just the appropriate level for building molecules which are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms allows for the building of extremely long and [[organic compound|complex molecules]].\n\nThe presence of liquid water is an assumed requirement, as it is a common molecule and provides an excellent environment for the formation of complicated carbon-based molecules that could eventually lead to the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/astrobiology-spsc-04/ |title=Astrobiology |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2006 |publisher=Macmillan Science Library: Space Sciences. }}</ref> Some researchers posit environments of water-[[ammonia]] mixtures as possible solvents for [[hypothetical types of biochemistry]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article2057.html |title=The Ammonia-Oxidizing Gene |accessdate=20 October 2008 |author=Penn State |date=19 August 2006 |publisher=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\nA third assumption is to focus on planets orbiting [[Sun]]-like [[star]]s for increased probabilities of [[planetary habitability]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |title=Stars and Habitable Planets |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2007 |publisher=Sol Company |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001194624/http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |archivedate=1 October 2008 |deadurl=yes }}</ref> Very large stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life might not have time to emerge on [[planet]]s orbiting them.

To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably [[NASA]]'s [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] (TPF) and [[European Space Agency|ESA's]] [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]] programs, both of which have been cancelled.

By examining planetary spectra, it would be possible to determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface. Given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vpl.astro.washington.edu/main/about_vpl.html |title=The Virtual Planet Laboratory |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2008 |publisher=NASA }}</ref> is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what they would look like if viewed by TPF or Darwin.

The information gathered by this discipline allows the measure of a [[planet]]'s or a [[natural satellite]]'s potential to develop and sustain [[life]], or [[planetary habitability]].\n\nAn additional discipline of astrogeology is [[geochemistry]], which involves study of the [[chemistry|chemical]] composition of the Earth and other [[planet]]s, chemical processes and reactions that govern the composition of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s and [[soil]]s, the cycles of matter and energy and their interaction with the [[hydrosphere]] and the [[atmosphere]] of the planet. Specializations include [[cosmochemistry]], [[biochemistry]] and [[organic geochemistry]].\n\nThe [[fossil record]] provides the oldest known evidence for life on Earth.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/fossils/succession.html |title=Fossil Succession |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=14 August 1997 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081014190106/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/fossils/succession.html| archivedate= 14 October 2008| deadurl= no}}</ref> By examining the fossil evidence, [[paleontologists]] are able to better understand the types of organisms that arose on the early Earth. Some regions on Earth, such as the [[Pilbara]] in [[Western Australia]] and the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] of Antarctica, are also considered to be geological analogs to regions of Mars, and as such, might be able to provide clues on how to search for past [[life on Mars]].\n\nThe various organic functional groups, composed of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and a host of metals, such as iron, magnesium, and zinc, provide the enormous diversity of chemical reactions necessarily catalyzed by a living [[organism]]. Silicon, in contrast, interacts with only a few other atoms, and the large silicon molecules are monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules.<ref name=BC/><ref name=\"Pace\"/> Indeed, it seems likely that the basic building blocks of life anywhere will be similar  those on Earth, in the generality if not in the detail.<ref name=\"Pace\"/> Although terrestrial life and life that might arise independently of Earth are expected to use many similar, if not identical, building blocks, they also are expected to have some biochemical qualities that are unique.

As the structural basis for life, one of carbon's important features is that unlike silicon, it can readily engage in the formation of chemical bonds with many other atoms, thereby allowing for the

Most of the planets so far discovered outside the Solar System are hot gas giants thought to be inhospitable to life, so it is not yet known whether the Solar System, with a warm, rocky, metal-rich inner planet such as Earth, is of an aberrant composition. Improved detection methods and increased observation time will undoubtedly discover more planetary systems, and possibly some more like ours. For example, NASA's [[Kepler Mission]] seeks to discover Earth-sized planets around other stars by measuring minute changes in the star's [[light curve]] as the planet passes between the star and the spacecraft.

Many air shows are held in support of local, national or military charities. [[Military]] air firms often organise air shows at military airfields as a public relations exercise to thank the local community, promote military careers and raise the profile of the military.\n\n[[File:Airshow Nellis AFB.JPG|thumb|left|Aviation Nation 2006 at [[Nellis Air Force Base]], United States]]\n\nAir \"seasons\" vary around the world. The United States enjoys a long season that generally runs from March to November, covering the spring, summer, and fall seasons. Other countries often have much shorter seasons. In Japan air shows are generally events held at [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] bases regularly throughout the year. The European season usually starts in late April or Early May and is usually over by mid October. The [[Middle East]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] hold their events between January and March. However, for many acts, the \"off-season\" does not mean a period of inactivity; pilots and performers use this time for maintenance and practice.\n\n[[File:Patrouille Suisse at ILA 2010 07.jpg|thumb|The [[Patrouille Suisse]] performing at the [[ILA Berlin Air Show]]]]\n\nThe type of displays seen at an are constrained by a number of factors, including the weather and visibility. Most aviation authorities now publish rules and guidance on minimum display heights and criteria for differing conditions. In addition to the weather, pilots and organizers must also consider local airspace restrictions. Most exhibitors will plan \"full,\" \"rolling\" and \"flat\" display for varying weather and airspace conditions.\n\nThe types of shows vary greatly. Some are large scale military events with large flying displays and ground exhibitions while others held at small local airstrips can often feature just one or two hours of flying with just a few [[:wikt:stall|stall]]s on the ground. Air Displays can be held during day or night with the latter becoming increasingly popular. Shows don't always take place over airfields; some have been held over the grounds of stately homes or castles and over the sea at coastal resorts.\n\nThe first public international airshow, at which many types of aircraft were displayed and flown, was the [[Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Champagne]], which was held Aug. 22-29, 1909 in Reims. This had been preceded by what may have been the first ever gathering of enthusiasts, June 28-July 19 of the same year at the airfield at La Brayelle, near Dubai.\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:red.bull.air.race.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|Air racing at an air show in [[England]]: the [[Red Bull Air Race]] heat held at [[Kemble Airfield]], [[Gloucestershire]]. The aircraft fly singly, and pass between pairs of pylons]]\n\nBefore the [[World War II|Second World War]], air shows were associated with long distance air races, often lasting many days and covering thousands of miles. While the [[Reno Air Races]] keep this tradition alive, most air shows today primarily feature a series of aerial demos of short duration.\n\nMost air shows feature [[warbird]]s, aerobatics, and demonstrations of modern military aircraft, and many air shows offer a variety of other aeronautical attractions as well, such as wing-walking, radio-controlled aircraft, water/slurry drops from firefighting aircraft, simulated helicopter rescues and [[sky diving]].\n\nSpecialist aerobatic aircraft have powerful piston engines, light weight and big control surfaces, making them capable of very high roll rates and accelerations. A skilled pilot will be able to climb vertically, perform very tight turns, tumble his aircraft end-over-end and perform manoeuvres during loops.\n\nLarger airshows can be headlined by military jet demonstration teams.\nIn the United States, those are the [[Blue Angels|U.S. Navy Blue Angels]] and [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds|USAF Thunderbirds]].\nThe [[Snowbirds|Canadian Forces Snowbirds]] will headline many airshows in Canada and the United States.\nMany airshows in the United Kingdom are headlined by the RAF's [[Red Arrows]].\n\n[[File:F-111-Fuel-Dump,-Avalon,-VIC-23.03.2007.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]] performing a [[Fuel dumping#Dump-and-burn|dump-and-burn]] [[Fuel dumping|fuel dump]] at the [[Australian International Airshow]]]]\n\nSolo military jet demos, also known as tactical demo, feature one aircraft, usually a strike fighter or an advanced trainer. The demonstration focuses on the capabilities of modern aircraft used in combat operations. The display will usually demonstrate the aircraft's very short (and often very loud)  rolls, fast speeds, slow approach speeds, as well as their ability to quickly make tight turns, to climb quickly, and their ability to be precisely controlled at a large range of speeds. Manoeuvres include aileron rolls, barrel rolls, hesitation rolls, Cuban-8s, tight turns, high-alpha flight, a high-speed pass, double Immelmans, and touch-and-gos. Tactical demos may include simulated bomb drops, sometimes with pyrotechnics on the ground for effect. Aircraft with special characteristics that give them unique capabilities will often display those in their demos; For example, Russian fighters with [[Thrust vectoring]] may be used to perform [[Pugachev's Cobra]] or the [[Kulbit]], among other difficult manoeuvers that cannot be performed by other aircraft. Similarly, an [[F-22]] pilot may hover his jet in the air with the nose pointed straight up, a [[Harrier Jump Jet|Harrier]] or [[V-22|Osprey]] pilot may perform a vertical landing or vertical takeoff, and so on.\n\n==Safety==\n[[File:crash.arp.600pix.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mountain Home Air Force Base]], [[Idaho]], September 14, 2003: [[U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds]] Captain Christopher Stricklin [[Ejection seat|ejecting]] from his [[F-16]] after realizing he could not pull up in time from a [[Split S|Split-S]] and ensuring the aircraft would not crash into spectators. The aircraft was destroyed less than a second later with no loss of life.]]\n\nAir shows may present some risk to spectators and aviators. Accidents have occurred, sometimes with a large loss of life, such as the [[Ramstein airshow disaster|1988 disaster at Ramstein Air Base]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Sknyliv airshow disaster|2002 air show crash at Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]. Because of these accidents, the various aviation authorities around the world have set rules and guidance for those running and participating in air displays. Air displays are often monitored by aviation authorities to ensure safe procedures.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, local authorities will first need to approve any application for an event to which the public is admitted. No approval, no event. The first priority must be to arrange insurance cover and details can be obtained from your local authority. An added complication is a whole new raft of legislation concerning Health & Safety in particular Corporate Manslaughter, which can involve the event organiser being charged with a criminal offence if any of the insurances and risk assessments are not fully completed well in advance of the event. If this very basic step isn't completed then any further activity should be halted until it is.\n\nRules govern the distance from the crowds that aircraft must fly. These vary according to the rating of the pilot/crew, the type of aircraft and the way the aircraft is being flown. For instance, slower lighter aircraft are usually allowed closer and lower to the crowd than larger, faster types. Also, a fighter jet flying straight and level will be able to do so closer to the crowd and lower than if it were performing a roll or a loop.\n\nPilots can get authorizations for differing types of displays (i.e. limbo flying, basic aerobatics to unlimited aerobatics) and to differing minimum base heights above the ground. To gain such authorizations, the pilots will have to demonstrate to an examiner that they can perform to those limits without endangering themselves, ground crew or spectators.\n\nDespite display rules and guidances, accidents have continued to happen. However, air show accidents are rare and where there is proper supervision air shows have impressive safety records. Each year, organizations such as [http://www.airshows.aero International Council of Air Shows] and [[European Airshow Council]] meet and discuss various subjects including air show safety where accidents are discussed and lessons learned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/cleveland/article/Cleveland-National-Air-Show-Awarded-Prestigious-Pinnacle-Award-20161216|title=Cleveland National Air Show Awarded Prestigious Pinnacle Award|first=BWW News|last=Desk|date=|website=broadwayworld.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fly-in]]\n* [[Flypast]]\n* [[Barnstorming]]\n* [[List of airshow accidents]]\n* [[List of air shows]]\n* [[Teardrop turn]]\n* [[Whifferdill turn]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Air shows}}\n*[http://www.airshows.aero International Council of Air Shows]\n*[http://www.eaa.org/calendar/ Experimental Aircraft Association Calendar]\n*[http://www.royalaeroclub.org/events.htm Royal Aero Club Events]\n*[http://www.flightglobal.com/air-shows/ Flightglobal's Upcoming air shows]\n* [http://afthunderbirds.com/site/ USAF Thunderbirds]\n* [http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/snowbirds/index.page Canadian Forces Snowbirds]\n\n{{International Airshows}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Air Show}}\n[[Category:Air shows| ]]\n[[Category:History of transport events]]", "sha1": "4pbv6k4usybmnil4shs3uzn1i6hkk7x"}}, {"title": "Anthropic principle", "ns": "0", "id": "2792", "revision": {"id": "865653929", "parentid": "865653336", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T09:22:08Z", "contributor": {"username": "Pbsouthwood", "id": "10044298"}, "comment": "/* See also */ convert to annotated links", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|Philosophical consideration that observations of the universe must be compatible with the observers}}\n{{redirect|Anthropic bias|the book|Anthropic Bias (book)}}\nThe '''anthropic principle''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical consideration]] that observations of the [[universe]] must be compatible with the [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[sapience|sapient]] [[life]] that observes it. Some proponents of the anthropic principle reason that it explains why this universe has the [[age of the universe|age]] and the [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the [[Fine-tuned Universe|narrow range thought to be compatible with life]].<ref>[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html  Anthropic Principle]</ref><ref>[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ James Schombert, Department of Physics at University of Oregon]</ref>\nThe '''strong anthropic principle''' ('''SAP''') as explained by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]] states that this is all the case because the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life [[emergence|emerge]] within it. Some critics of the SAP argue in favor of a '''weak anthropic principle''' ('''WAP''') similar to the one defined by [[Brandon Carter]], which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of [[selection bias]] (specifically [[survivor bias]]): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting on the matter. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the [[multiverse]] for there to be a [[statistical population]] of universes to select from and from which selection bias (our observance of ''only'' this universe, compatible with ''our'' life) could occur.\n\n==Definition and basis==\nThe principle was formulated as a response to a [[Fine-tuned Universe|series of observations]] that the laws of nature and parameters of the universe take on values that are consistent with conditions for life as we know it rather than a set of values that would not be consistent with life on [[Earth]].  The anthropic principle states that this is a [[a priori and a posteriori|necessity]], because if life were impossible, no living entity would be there to observe it, and thus would not be known. That is, it must be possible to observe ''some'' universe, and hence, the laws and constants of any such universe must accommodate that possibility.\n\nThe term ''[[wikt:anthropic|anthropic]]'' in \"anthropic principle\" has been argued<ref>Moster\u00edn J., (2005), ''Antropic Explanations in Cosmology'', in  Hajek, Vald\u00e9s & Westerstahl (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 12th International Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science''; http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1658/\"</ref> to be a [[misnomer]].<ref>\"anthropic\" means \"of or pertaining to mankind or humans\".</ref>  While singling out our kind of carbon-based life, none of the finely tuned phenomena require [[human]] life or some kind of [[carbon chauvinism]].<ref>[http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/ant_encyc.pdf The Anthropic Principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617015335/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/ant_encyc.pdf |date=June 17, 2012 }}, Victor J.

All versions of the principle have been accused of discouraging the search for a deeper physical understanding of the universe. The anthropic principle is often criticized for lacking [[falsifiability]] and therefore critics of the anthropic principle may point out that the anthropic principle is a non-scientific concept, even though the weak anthropic principle, \"conditions that are observed in the universe must allow the observer to exist\",<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anthropic%20principle anthropic principle].

Small rocky planets did not yet exist.  If the universe were 10 times older than it actually is, most stars would be too old to remain on the [[main sequence]] and would have turned into [[white dwarf]]s, aside from the dimmest [[red dwarf]]s, and stable planetary systems would have already come to an end. Thus, Dicke explained the coincidence between large dimensionless numbers constructed from the constants of physics and the age of the universe, a coincidence which had inspired [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis|Dirac's varying-G theory]].\n\nDicke later reasoned that the density of matter in the universe must be almost exactly the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]] needed to prevent the [[Big Crunch]] (the \"Dicke coincidences\" [[argument]]). The most recent measurements may suggest that the observed density of [[baryon]]ic matter, and some theoretical predictions of the amount of [[dark matter]] account for about 30% of this critical density, with the rest contributed by a [[Cosmological constant problem|cosmological constant]].

Water, as well as sufficiently long-lived stable stars, both essential for the emergence of life as we know it, would not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe's age, structure, and capacity for life.\n\n==Origin==\n[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was among the first atheist proponents of arguments along similar lines to the anthropic principle.<ref>Arthur Schopenhauer, ''Arthur Schopenhauer: The World as Will and Presentation, Volume 1'', Routledge, 2016, p. 211: \"the world [is a] mere ''presentation'', object for a subject...\"</ref><ref>Lennart Svensson, ''Borderline: A Traditionalist Outlook for Modern Man'', Numen Books, 2015, p. 71: \"[Schopenhauer] said that \"the world is our conception.\" A world without a perceiver would in that case be an impossibility.

The world is there for the sake of man.\"</ref>\n\nThe phrase \"anthropic principle\" first appeared in [[Brandon Carter]]'s contribution to a 1973 [[Krak\u00f3w]] [[symposium]] honouring [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] 500th birthday. Carter, a theoretical astrophysicist, articulated the Anthropic Principle in reaction to the [[Copernican Principle]], which states that humans do not occupy a privileged position in the [[Universe]]. As Carter said: \"Although our situation is not necessarily ''central'', it is inevitably privileged to some extent.\"<ref>{{cite conference|first=B.| last = Carter | authorlink = Brandon Carter | booktitle =IAU Symposium 63: Confrontation of Cosmological Theories with Observational Data | publisher =Reidel | date = 1974 | location = Dordrecht |title = Large Number Coincidences and the Anthropic Principle in Cosmology | pages = 291\u2013298}}; republished in General Relativity and Gravitation (Nov. 2011), Vol. 43, Iss. 11, p. 3225-3233, with an introduction by [[George F. R. Ellis|George Ellis]] (available on [[Arxiv]]</ref> Specifically, Carter disagreed with using the Copernican principle to justify the [[Perfect Cosmological Principle]], which states that all large regions ''and times'' in the universe must be statistically identical. The latter principle underlay the [[steady-state theory]], which had recently been falsified by the 1965 discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. This discovery was unequivocal evidence that the universe has changed radically over time (for example, via the [[Big Bang]]).\n\nCarter defined two forms of the anthropic principle, a \"weak\" one which referred only to anthropic selection of privileged [[spacetime]] locations in the universe, and a more controversial \"strong\" form which addressed the values of the fundamental constants of physics.\n\n[[Roger Penrose]] explained the weak form as follows:\n\n{{quote|The argument can be used to explain why the conditions happen to be just right for the existence of (intelligent) life on the Earth at the present time. For if they were not just right, then we should not have found ourselves to be here now, but somewhere else, at some other appropriate time. This principle was used very effectively by Brandon Carter and [[Robert Dicke]] to resolve an issue that had puzzled physicists for a good many years. The issue concerned various striking numerical relations that are observed to hold between the physical constants (the [[gravitational constant]], the mass of the [[proton]], the [[age of the universe]], etc.). A puzzling aspect of this was that some of the relations hold only at the present epoch in the Earth's history, so we appear, coincidentally, to be living at a very special time (give or take a few million years!). This was later explained, by Carter and Dicke, by the fact that this epoch coincided with the lifetime of what are called [[main-sequence]] stars, such as the Sun. At any other epoch, the argument ran, there would be no intelligent life around to measure the physical constants in question\u2014so the coincidence had to hold, simply because there would be [[Sapience|intelligent life]] around only at the particular time that the coincidence did hold!|''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]'', Chapter 10}}\n\nOne reason this is plausible is that there are many other places and times in which we can imagine finding ourselves. But when applying the strong principle, we only have one universe, with one set of fundamental parameters, so what exactly is the point being made? Carter offers two possibilities: First, we can use our own existence to make \"predictions\" about the parameters. But second, \"as a last resort\", we can convert these predictions into ''explanations'' by assuming that there ''is'' more than one universe, in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes, something that is now called the [[multiverse]] (\"world ensemble\" was Carter's term), in which the parameters (and perhaps the laws of physics) vary across universes. The strong principle then becomes an example of a [[selection effect]], exactly analogous to the weak principle. Postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step, but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question which had seemed to be out of the reach of normal science: \"why do the [[list of laws of science|fundamental laws of physics]] take the particular form we observe and not another?\"\n\nSince Carter's 1973 paper, the term \"anthropic principle\" has been extended to cover a number of ideas which differ in important ways from those he espoused. Particular confusion was caused in 1986 by the book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]],<ref>{{BarrowTipler1986}}</ref> published that year which distinguished between \"weak\" and \"strong\" anthropic principle in a way very different from Carter's, as discussed in the next section.\n\nCarter was not the first to invoke some form of the anthropic principle. In fact, the [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] anticipated the anthropic principle as long ago as 1904: \"Such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been absolutely required [...] in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man.\"<ref>{{cite book| authorlink = Alfred R.

Barrow|John Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]] depart from Carter and define the WAP and SAP as follows:<ref>{{cite journal | author = Barrow, John D. | title = Anthropic Definitions | journal = Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume = 24| pages = 146\u201353 | date = 1997 | bibcode=1983QJRAS..24..146B }}</ref><ref>Barrow & Tipler's definitions are quoted verbatim at ''[http://www.dhushara.com/book/quantcos/anth/anth.htm Genesis of Eden Diversity Encyclopedia.]''</ref>\n\n'''Weak anthropic principle (WAP)''' (Barrow and Tipler): \"The observed values of all physical and [[cosmological]] quantities are not equally probable but they take on values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where [[carbon-based life]] can [[evolution|evolve]] and by the requirements that the universe be old enough for it to have already done so.\"<ref>Barrow and Tipler 1986: 16.</ref><br>Unlike Carter they restrict the principle to carbon-based life, rather than just \"observers\". A more important difference is that they apply the WAP to the fundamental physical constants, such as the [[fine structure constant]], the number of [[Spacetime#Privileged character of 3+1 spacetime|spacetime dimensions]], and the [[cosmological constant]]\u2014topics that fall under Carter's SAP.\n\n'''Strong anthropic principle (SAP)''' (Barrow and Tipler): \"The Universe must have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history.\"<ref>Barrow and Tipler 1986: 21.</ref><br>This looks very similar to Carter's SAP, but unlike the case with Carter's SAP, the \"must\" is an imperative, as shown by the following three possible elaborations of the SAP, each proposed by Barrow and Tipler:<ref>Barrow and Tipler 1986: 22.</ref>\n* \"There exists one possible Universe 'designed' with the goal of generating and sustaining 'observers'.\"\n::This can be seen as simply the classic [[design argument]] restated in the garb of contemporary [[cosmology]].

Faber & Faber {{ISBN|0-571-23217-5}}</ref>}}\n\n== Character of anthropic reasoning ==\nCarter chose to focus on a tautological aspect of his ideas, which has resulted in much confusion. In fact, anthropic reasoning interests scientists because of something that is only implicit in the above formal definitions, namely that we should give serious consideration to there being other universes with different values of the \"fundamental parameters\"\u2014that is, the [[dimensionless physical constant]]s and initial conditions for the [[Big Bang]]. Carter and others have argued that life as we know it would not be possible in most such universes. In other words, the universe we are in is [[fine-tuned universe|fine tuned]] to permit life. Collins & Hawking (1973) characterized Carter's then-unpublished big idea as the postulate that \"there is not one universe but a whole infinite ensemble of universes with all possible initial conditions\".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Collins C.

Ours must be one of these, and so the observed fine tuning should be no cause for wonder.\n\nAlthough philosophers have discussed related concepts for centuries, in the early 1970s the only genuine physical theory yielding a multiverse of sorts was the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. This would allow variation in initial conditions, but not in the truly fundamental constants. Since that time a number of mechanisms for producing a multiverse have been suggested: see the review by [[Max Tegmark]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Tegmark, M. | authorlink = Max Tegmark | title = Is 'the theory of everything' merely the ultimate ensemble theory?| journal = Annals of Physics | volume = 270 | pages = 1\u201351| date = 1998 | doi = 10.1006/aphy.1998.5855|arxiv = gr-qc/9704009 |bibcode = 1998AnPhy.270....1T }}</ref> An important development in the 1980s was the combination of [[inflation theory]] with the hypothesis that some parameters are determined by [[symmetry breaking]] in the early universe, which allows parameters previously thought of as \"fundamental constants\" to vary over very large distances, thus eroding the distinction between Carter's weak and strong principles. At the beginning of the 21st century, the [[string landscape]] emerged as a mechanism for varying essentially all the constants, including the number of spatial dimensions.<ref>Strictly speaking, the number of non-compact dimensions, see [[String theory]].</ref>\n\nThe anthropic idea that fundamental parameters are selected from a multitude of different possibilities (each actual in some universe or other) contrasts with the traditional hope of physicists for a [[theory of everything]] having no free parameters. As [[Einstein]] said: \"What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world.\" In 2002, proponents of the leading candidate for a \"theory of everything\", [[string theory]], proclaimed \"the end of the anthropic principle\"<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kane, Gordon L. | author2 = Perry, Malcolm J. | author3 = Zytkow, Anna N. | last-author-amp = yes | title=The Beginning of the End of the Anthropic Principle | journal = New Astronomy | volume = 7 | date = 2002 | pages = 45\u201353  | doi=10.1016/S1384-1076(01)00088-4 | arxiv=astro-ph/0001197|bibcode = 2002NewA....7...45K }}</ref> since there would be no free parameters to select. String theory now seems to offer no hope of predicting fundamental parameters, and now some who advocate it invoke the anthropic principle as well (see [[#String theory|below]]).\n\nThe modern form of a [[design argument]] is put forth by [[intelligent design]]. Proponents of intelligent design often cite the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning]] observations that (in part) preceded the formulation of the anthropic principle by Carter as a proof of an intelligent designer. Opponents of intelligent design are not limited to those who hypothesize that other universes exist; they may also argue, anti-anthropically, that the universe is less fine-tuned than often claimed, or that accepting fine tuning as a brute fact is less astonishing than the idea of an intelligent creator. Furthermore, even accepting fine tuning, [[Elliott Sober|Sober]] (2005)<ref>Sober, Elliott, 2005, \"[http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/black-da.pdf The Design Argument]\" in Mann, W.

Unpublished FAQ \"[http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/anthropic.html The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism.]\"</ref> argue that the Anthropic Principle as conventionally stated actually undermines intelligent design; see [[fine-tuned universe]].\n\n[[Paul Davies]]'s book ''[[The Goldilocks Enigma]]'' (2006) reviews the current state of the fine tuning debate in detail, and concludes by enumerating the following responses to that debate:\n#The absurd universe: Our universe just happens to be the way it is.\n#The unique universe: There is a deep underlying unity in physics which necessitates the Universe being the way it is. Some [[Theory of Everything]] will explain why the various features of the Universe must have exactly the values that we see.\n#The multiverse: Multiple universes exist, having all possible combinations of characteristics, and we inevitably find ourselves within a universe that allows us to exist.\n#Intelligent design: A creator designed the Universe with the purpose of supporting complexity and the emergence of intelligence.\n#The life principle: There is an underlying principle that constrains the Universe to evolve towards life and mind.\n#The self-explaining universe: A closed explanatory or causal loop: \"perhaps only universes with a capacity for consciousness can exist\". This is [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler's]] Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP).\n#The fake universe: We live inside a [[virtual reality simulation]].\n\nOmitted here is [[Lee Smolin]]'s model of [[Fecund universes theory|cosmological natural selection]], also known as \"fecund universes\", which proposes that universes have \"offspring\" which are more plentiful if they resemble our universe. Also see Gardner (2005).<ref>Gardner, James N., 2005, \"[http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-physical-constants-as-biosignature-an-anthropic-retrodiction-of-the-selfish-biocosm-hypothesis The Physical Constants as Biosignature: An anthropic retrodiction of the Selfish Biocosm Hypothesis,]\" ''[[International Journal of Astrobiology]]''.</ref>\n\nClearly each of these hypotheses resolve some aspects of the puzzle, while leaving others unanswered. Followers of Carter would admit only option 3 as an anthropic explanation, whereas 3 through 6 are covered by different versions of Barrow and Tipler's SAP (which would also include 7 if it is considered a variant of 4, as in Tipler 1994).\n\nThe anthropic principle, at least as Carter conceived it, can be applied on scales much smaller than the whole universe. For example, Carter (1983)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Carter, B. | title = The anthropic principle and its implications for biological evolution | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | volume = A310 | pages = 347\u2013363 | date = 1983 | doi = 10.1098/rsta.1983.0096 | last2 = McCrea | first2 = W.

With this in mind, Carter concluded that given the best estimates of the [[age of the universe]], the evolutionary chain culminating in ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' probably admits only one or two low probability links.\n\n==Observational evidence==\nNo possible observational evidence bears on Carter's WAP, as it is merely advice to the scientist and asserts nothing debatable. The obvious test of Barrow's SAP, which says that the universe is \"required\" to support life, is to find evidence of life in universes other than ours. Any other universe is, by most definitions, unobservable (otherwise it would be included in ''our'' portion of ''this'' universe). Thus, in principle Barrow's SAP cannot be falsified by observing a universe in which an observer cannot exist.\n\nPhilosopher [[John Andrew Leslie|John Leslie]]<ref>Leslie, J. (1986) op. cit.</ref> states that the Carter SAP (with [[multiverse]]) predicts the following:\n* Physical theory will evolve so as to strengthen the hypothesis that early [[phase transition]]s occur probabilistically rather than deterministically, in which case there will be no deep physical reason for the values of fundamental constants;\n* Various theories for generating [[multiverse|multiple universes]] will prove robust;\n* Evidence that the universe is [[fine tuned universe|fine tuned]] will continue to accumulate;\n* No life with a [[alternative biochemistry|non-carbon chemistry]] will be discovered;\n* Mathematical studies of [[galaxy formation]] will confirm that it is sensitive to the rate of [[expansion of the universe]].\n\nHogan<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hogan, Craig | title = Why is the universe just so? | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume =  72 | date = 2000 | pages = 1149\u20131161 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.72.1149 | bibcode=2000RvMP...72.1149H|arxiv = astro-ph/9909295 | issue = 4 }}</ref> has emphasised that it would be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact we might have to resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe ''not'' to support life.\n\nProbabilistic predictions of parameter values can be made given:\n#a particular multiverse with a \"[[measure theory|measure]]\", i.e. a well defined \"density of universes\" (so, for parameter ''X'', one can calculate the [[prior probability]] ''P''(''X''<sub>0</sub>) ''dX'' that ''X'' is in the range ''X''<sub>0</sub> < ''X'' < ''X''<sub>0</sub> + ''dX''), and\n#an estimate of the number of observers in each universe, ''N''(''X'') (e.g., this might be taken as proportional to the number of stars in the universe).\nThe probability of observing value ''X'' is then proportional to ''N''(''X'') ''P''(''X''). A generic feature of an analysis of this nature is that the expected values of the fundamental physical constants should not be \"over-tuned\", i.e. if there is some perfectly tuned predicted value (e.g. zero), the observed value need be no closer to that predicted value than what is required to make life possible. The small but finite value of the [[cosmological constant]] can be regarded as a successful prediction in this sense.\n\nOne thing that would ''not'' count as evidence for the Anthropic Principle is evidence  that the Earth or the [[solar system]] occupied a privileged position in the universe, in violation of the [[Copernican principle]] (for possible counterevidence to this principle, see [[Copernican principle]]), unless there was some reason to think that that position was a [[necessary condition]] for our existence as observers.\n\n==Applications of the principle==\n{{Synthesis|date=December 2010}}\n\n===The nucleosynthesis of carbon-12===\n[[Fred Hoyle]] may have invoked anthropic reasoning to predict an astrophysical phenomenon. He is said to have reasoned from the prevalence on Earth of life forms whose chemistry was based on [[carbon-12]] [[atom]]s, that there must be an undiscovered [[resonance]] in the carbon-12 nucleus facilitating its synthesis in stellar interiors via the [[triple-alpha process]].

That the tiny patch of space from which our observable universe grew had to be extremely orderly, to allow the post-inflation universe to have an arrow of time, makes it unnecessary to adopt any \"ad hoc\" hypotheses about the initial entropy state, hypotheses other Big Bang theories require.\n\n=== String theory ===\n{{Main|String theory landscape}}\n[[String theory]] predicts a large number of possible universes, called the \"backgrounds\" or \"vacua\". The set of these vacua is often called the \"[[multiverse]]\" or \"[[String theory landscape|anthropic landscape]]\" or \"string landscape\". [[Leonard Susskind]] has argued that the existence of a large number of vacua puts anthropic reasoning on firm ground: only universes whose properties are such as to allow observers to exist are observed, while a possibly much larger set of universes lacking such properties go unnoticed.\n\n[[Steven Weinberg]]<ref>{{cite conference | author = Weinberg, S. | authorlink = Steven Weinberg | date = 2007 | title = Living in the multiverse | booktitle = Universe or multiverse? | editor = B.

Barrow]], a [[cosmologist]], and [[Frank J. Tipler]], a [[cosmologist]] and [[mathematical physicist]]. This book sets out in detail the many known anthropic coincidences and constraints, including many found by its authors. While the book is primarily a work of theoretical [[astrophysics]], it also touches on [[quantum physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[earth science]]. An entire chapter argues that ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is, with high probability, the only [[extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent species]] in the [[Milky Way]].\n\nThe book begins with an extensive review of many topics in the [[history of ideas]] the authors deem relevant to the anthropic principle, because the authors believe that principle has important antecedents in the notions of [[teleology]] and [[intelligent design]]. They discuss the writings of [[Fichte]], [[Hegel]], [[Bergson]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and the [[Omega Point]] cosmology of [[Teilhard de Chardin]]. Barrow and Tipler carefully distinguish [[teleology|teleological]] reasoning from [[eutaxiology|''eutaxiological'']] reasoning; the former asserts that order must have a consequent purpose; the latter asserts more modestly that order must have a planned cause. They attribute this important but nearly always overlooked distinction to an obscure 1883 book by L. E. Hicks.<ref>{{cite book| last=Hicks| first= L. E.| date=1883| title=A Critique of Design Arguments| location=New York| publisher=Scribner's}}</ref>\n\nSeeing little sense in a principle requiring intelligent life to emerge while remaining indifferent to the possibility of its eventual extinction, Barrow and Tipler propose the [[final anthropic principle]] (FAP): Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.<ref>Barrow and Tipler 1986: 23</ref>\n\nBarrow and Tipler submit that the FAP is both a valid physical statement and \"closely connected with moral values\". FAP places strong constraints on the structure of the [[universe]], constraints developed further in Tipler's ''The Physics of Immortality''.<ref>{{cite book | first = F.

And this is the end.<ref>Barrow and Tipler 1986: 677</ref>}}\n\n==Reception and controversies  ==\nCarter  has frequently regretted his own choice of the word \"anthropic\", because it conveys the misleading impression that the principle involves humans specifically, rather than intelligent observers in general.<ref>e.g. Carter (2004) op. cit.</ref> Others<ref>e.g. message from [[Martin Rees]] presented at the Kavli-CERCA conference (see video in External links)</ref> have criticised the word \"principle\" as being too grandiose to describe straightforward applications of [[selection effects]].\n\nA common criticism of Carter's SAP is that it is an easy [[deus ex machina]] which discourages searches for physical explanations. To quote Penrose again: \"[I]t tends to be invoked by theorists whenever they do not have a good enough theory to explain the observed facts.\"<ref>{{cite book | author = Penrose, R. |authorlink = Roger Penrose | title = The Emperor's New Mind | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-851973-7 | date =1989}} Chapter 10.</ref>\n\nCarter's SAP and Barrow and Tipler's WAP have been dismissed as [[truism]]s or trivial [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]\u2014that is, statements true solely by virtue of their [[logical form]] (the conclusion is identical to the premise) and not because a substantive claim is made and supported by observation of reality. As such, they are criticized as an elaborate way of saying \"if things were different, they would be different\", which is a valid statement, but does not make a claim of some factual alternative over another.\n\nCritics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP claim that it is neither testable nor falsifiable, and thus is not a [[scientific method|scientific statement]] but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a [[multiverse]], although some argue{{who|date=March 2016}} that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes as a function of the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Starkman, G.

Similarly, [[Stephen Jay Gould]],<ref>{{cite conference| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay| date =1998| title=Clear Thinking in the Sciences |booktitle=Lectures at Harvard University}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay | date= 2002 | title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time| isbn=0-7167-3090-1  }}</ref> [[Michael Shermer]],<ref>{{cite book| last=Shermer| first=Michael | date= 2007 | title=Why Darwin Matters| isbn=0-8050-8121-6}}</ref> and others claim that the stronger versions of the anthropic principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house [[barnacle]]s. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned]] through [[natural selection]] to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to the universe, and not vice versa.\n\nSome applications of the anthropic principle have been criticized as an [[argument by lack of imagination]], for tacitly assuming that carbon compounds and water are the only possible chemistry of life (sometimes called \"[[carbon chauvinism]]\", see also [[alternative biochemistry]]).<ref>e.g. {{cite journal | author = [[Bernard Carr|Carr, B.

However, if some of the fine-tuned details of our universe were violated, that would rule out complex structures of any kind\u2014[[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[galaxies]], etc.\n\n[[Lee Smolin]] has offered a theory designed to improve on the lack of imagination that anthropic principles have been accused of. He puts forth his [[Lee Smolin#Cosmological natural selection|fecund universes]] theory, which assumes universes have \"offspring\" through the creation of [[black hole]]s whose offspring universes have values of physical constants that depend on those of the mother universe.<ref>{{cite book| author=Lee Smolin| author-link=Lee Smolin | editor=Tyson, Neil deGrasse | editor-link=Neil deGrasse Tyson | editor2=Soter, Steve | editor2-link=Steven Soter| date=2001| title=Cosmic Horizons: Astronomy at the Cutting Edge | publisher= The New Press| isbn = 978-1-56584-602-9 | pages =148\u2013152}}</ref>\n\nThe philosophers of cosmology [[John Earman]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Earman John | date = 1987 | title = The SAP also rises: A critical examination of the anthropic principle | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 24 | pages = 307\u2013317 }}</ref> [[Ernan McMullin]],<ref>McMullin, Ernan.

Like the other RIRs, ARIN:\n\n*Provides services related to the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources\n*Facilitates policy development by its members and stakeholders\n*Participates in the international Internet community\n*Is a nonprofit, community-based organization\n*Is governed by an executive board elected by its membership\n\n==Services==\nARIN provides services related to the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources. The nature of these services is described in ARIN's mission statement:\n\n:''Applying the principles of stewardship, ARIN, a nonprofit corporation, allocates Internet Protocol resources; develops consensus-based policies; and facilitates the advancement of the Internet through information and educational outreach.''\n\nThese services are grouped in three areas: Registration, Organization, and Policy Development.\n\n===Registration services===\nRegistration services pertain to the technical coordination and inventory management of Internet number resources. Services include:\n\n*IPv4 address allocation and assignment\n*IPv6 address allocation and assignment\n*[[Autonomous system (Internet)|AS number]] assignment\n*Directory services including:\n**Registration transaction information (WHOIS)\n**Routing information (Internet Routing Registry)\n*DNS (Reverse)\n\nFor information on requesting Internet number resources from ARIN, see https://www.arin.net/resources/index.html. This section includes the request templates, specific distribution policies, and guidelines for requesting and managing Internet number resources.\n\n===Organization services===\nOrganization services pertain to interaction between stakeholders, ARIN members, and ARIN. Services include:\n\n*Elections\n*Members meetings\n*Information publication and dissemination\n*Education and training\n\n===Policy development services===\nPolicy development services facilitate the development of policy for the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources.\n\nAll ARIN policies are set by the community. Everyone is encouraged to participate in the policy development process at public policy meetings and on the Public Policy Mailing List. The ARIN Board of Trustees ratifies policies only after:\n\n#discussion on mailing lists and at meetings;\n#ARIN Advisory Council recommendation;\n#community consensus in favor of the policy; and\n#full legal and fiscal review.\n\nThe community develops policies by following a formal Policy Development Process as outlined at https://www.arin.net/policy/pdp.html. The Number Resource Policy Manual, ARIN's complete set of current policies, is available at https://www.arin.net/policy/nrpm.html.\n\n'''Membership is not required to participate in ARIN's policy development process or to apply for Internet number resources.'''\n\nServices include:\n\n*Maintaining discussion e-mail lists\n*Conducting public policy meetings\n*Publishing policy documents\n\n==Organizational structure==\nARIN consists of the Internet community within its region, its members, a 7-member Board of Trustees, a 15-member Advisory Council, and a professional staff of about 50. The Board of Trustees and Advisory Council are elected by ARIN members for three-year terms.\n\n===Board of trustees===\nThe ARIN membership elects the Board of Trustees (BoT), which has ultimate responsibility for the business affairs and financial health of ARIN, and manages ARIN's operations in a manner consistent with the guidance received from the Advisory Council and the goals set by the registry's members. The BoT is responsible for determining the disposition of all revenues received to ensure all services are provided in an equitable manner. The BoT ratifies proposals generated from the membership and submitted through the Advisory Council. Executive decisions are carried out following approval by the BoT. The BoT consists of 7 members consisting of a President and CEO, a Chairman, a Treasurer, and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=Board of Trustees|url=https://www.arin.net/about_us/bot.html|website=ARIN}}</ref>\n\n===Advisory council===\nIn addition to the BoT, ARIN has an advisory council that advises ARIN and the BoT on IP address allocation policy and related matters. Adhering to the procedures in the Internet Resource Policy Evaluation Process, the advisory council forwards consensus-based policy proposals to the BoT for ratification. The advisory council consists of 15 elected members consisting of a Chair, Vice Chair, and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=Advisory Council|url=https://www.arin.net/about_us/ac.html|website=ARIN}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe organization was formed in December 1997 to \"provide [[Internet Protocol|IP]] registration services as an independent, nonprofit corporation.\" Until this time, IP address registration (outside of [[RIPE]] and [[APNIC]] regions) was done in accordance with policies set by the [[IETF]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Network Information Services Manager(s) for NSFNET and the NREN: INTERNIC Registration Services|url=//archive.icann.org/en/nsi/coopagmt-01jan93.htm|publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> by [[Network Solutions]] corporation as part of the [[InterNIC]] project.

Kim was succeeded by Raymond \"Ray\" Plzak until the end of 2008. Trustee John Curran was acting President until July 1 of 2009 when he assumed the CEO role permanently.\n\nUntil late 2002 it served [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], [[South America]] and all of the [[Caribbean]].

This made the region a home to many craftsmen and tradesmen, as well as some low class [[samurai]]. One of Tokyo's frequent fires destroyed the area in 1869, and the people decided to replace the buildings of the area with a shrine called Chinkasha (now known as {{nihongo|Akiba Shrine|[[:ja:\u79cb\u8449\u795e\u793e (\u53f0\u6771\u533a)|\u79cb\u8449\u795e\u793e]]|Akiba Jinja}}), meaning fire extinguisher shrine, in an attempt to prevent the spread of future fires.

This disconnection of Akihabara from government authority has allowed the district to grow as a market city and given rise to an excellent atmosphere for entrepreneurship.<ref name=Yamada/> In the 1930s, this climate turned Akihabara into a future-oriented market region specializing in household [[electronics]], such as washing machines, refrigerators, televisions, and stereos, earning Akihabara the nickname \"Electric Town\".<ref name=\"Nobuoka\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Akihabara: Electric Town For Tech, Games, Anime!|url=http://japanistas.com/en/archives/18410}}</ref>\n\nAs household electronics began to lose their futuristic appeal in about the 1980s, the shops of Akihabara shifted their focus to home computers at a time when they were only used by specialists and hobbyists. This new specialization brought in a new type of consumer, computer nerds or ''otaku''.<ref name=Nobuoka/> The market in Akihabara naturally latched onto their new customer base that was focused on [[anime]], [[manga]], and video games. The connection between Akihabara and otaku has survived and grown to the point that the region is now known worldwide as a center for otaku culture, and some otaku even consider Akihabara to be a sacred place.<ref name=\"IMAI\">IMAI, Nobuharu. \"The Momentary and Placeless Community: Constructing a New Community with regards to Otaku Culture.\" ''Inter Faculty 1'' (2010).</ref>\n\n===Akihabara massacre===\n{{Main article|Akihabara massacre}}\nOn Sunday, 8 June 2008, at 12:33 [[Japan Standard Time|JST]], a man drove into a crowd with a truck, then stabbed at least 17 people using a dagger.

Akihabara tries to create an atmosphere as close as possible to the game and anime worlds of customers' interest. The streets of Akihabara are covered with anime and manga icons, and cosplayers line the sidewalks handing out advertisements, especially for [[maid caf\u00e9]]s. The idol group [[AKB48]], one of Japan's highest selling contemporary musical acts, runs its own theater in Akihabara, from which the group's name is derived.\n[[File:Naruto Cosplayers in Akihabara, Tokyo, Japan.jpg|thumbnail|[[Naruto Uzumaki|Naruto]] cosplayer attracting customers for a Manga and Anime shop]]\nRelease events, special events, and [[Fan convention|conventions]] in Akihabara give anime and manga fans frequent opportunities to meet the creators of the works they follow so closely and strengthen the connection between the region and ''otaku'' culture. The design of many of the buildings serves to create the sort of atmosphere that draws in ''otaku''.

Active Directory incorporates decades of communication technologies into the overarching Active Directory concept then makes improvements upon them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} For example, LDAP underpins Active Directory. Also [[X.500]] directories and the [[Organizational Unit]] preceded the Active Directory concept that makes use of those methods. The LDAP concept began to emerge even before the founding of Microsoft in April 1975, with RFCs as early as 1971. RFCs contributing to LDAP include RFC 1823 (on the LDAP API, August 1995),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1823.txt|title=The LDAP Application Program Interface|accessdate=2013-11-26}}</ref>RFC 2307, RFC 3062, and RFC 4533.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt|title      =An Approach for Using LDAP as a Network Information Service|accessdate=2013-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3062.txt|title=LDAP Password Modify Extended Operation|accessdate=2013-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4533.txt|title=The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Content Synchronization Operation|accessdate= 2013-11-26}}</ref>\n\nMicrosoft previewed Active Directory in 1999, released it first with [[Windows 2000]] Server edition, and revised it to extend functionality and improve administration in [[Windows Server 2003]]. Additional improvements came with subsequent versions of [[Windows Server]].

It stores information about members of the domain, including devices and users, [[authentication|verifies their credentials]] and [[authorization|defines their access rights]]. The server (or the cluster of servers) running this service is called a [[domain controller]]. A domain controller is contacted when a user logs into a device, accesses another device across the network, or runs a line-of-business [[Metro-style app]] [[sideloading|sideloaded]] into a device.\n\nOther Active Directory services (excluding [[#ADAM|LDS]], as described below) as well as most of Microsoft server technologies rely on or use Domain Services; examples include [[Group Policy]], [[Encrypting File System]], [[BitLocker]], [[Domain Name Services]], [[Remote Desktop Services]], [[Exchange Server]] and [[SharePoint Server]].\n\n==={{anchor|ADAM}} Lightweight Directory Services===\nActive Directory Lightweight Directory Services (''AD LDS''), formerly known as ''Active Directory Application Mode'' (ADAM),<ref name=\"Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services\">{{cite web| url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa705886(VS.85).aspx | title=AD LDS | accessdate=28 April 2009 | publisher=Microsoft }}</ref> is a light-weight implementation of AD DS.<ref name=\"Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services versus AD DS\">{{cite web| url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755080(v=ws.10).aspx | title=AD LDS versus AD DS | accessdate=25 February 2013 | publisher=Microsoft }}</ref> AD LDS runs as a [[Windows service|service]] on [[Windows Server]]. AD LDS shares the code base with AD DS and provides the same functionality, including an identical [[API]], but does not require the creation of domains or domain controllers. It provides a ''Data Store'' for storage of directory data and a ''[[Directory (database)|Directory Service]]'' with an LDAP ''Directory Service Interface''. Unlike AD DS, however, multiple AD LDS instances can run on the same server.\n\n===Certificate Services===\nActive Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) establishes an on-premises [[public key infrastructure]]. It can create, validate and revoke [[public key certificate]]s for internal uses of an organization. These certificates can be used to encrypt files (when used with [[Encrypting File System]]), emails (per [[S/MIME]] standard), and network traffic (when used by [[virtual private network]]s, [[Transport Layer Security]] protocol or [[IPSec]] protocol).\n\nAD CS predates Windows Server 2008, but its name was simply Certificate Services.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zacker|first1=Craig|editor1-last=Harding|editor1-first=Kathy|editor2-last=Jean|editor2-first=Trenary|editor3-last=Linda|editor3-first=Zacker|title=Planning and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows server 2003 Network Infrastructure|date=2003|publisher=Microsoft Press|location=Redmond, WA|isbn=0-7356-1893-3|pages=11\u201316<!--This is a single page's number!-->|chapter=11: Creating and Managing Digital Certificates}}</ref>\n\nAD CS requires an AD DS infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Active Directory Certificate Services Overview|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731564%28v=ws.10%29.aspx|website=[[Microsoft TechNet]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Federation Services===\n{{Main article|Active Directory Federation Services}}\nActive Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is a [[single sign-on]] service. With an AD FS infrastructure in place, users may use several web-based services (e.g. [[internet forum]], [[blog]], [[online shopping]], [[webmail]]) or network resources using only one set of credentials stored at a central location, as opposed to having to be granted a dedicated set of credentials for each service. AD FS's purpose is an extension of that of AD DS: The latter enables users to authenticate with and use the devices that are part of the same network, using one set of credentials. The former enables them to use the same set of credentials in a different network.\n\nAs the name suggests, AD FS works based on the concept of [[federated identity]].\n\nAD FS requires an AD DS infrastructure, although its federation partner may not.<ref>{{cite web|title=Step 1: Preinstallation Tasks|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771806%28v=ws.10%29.aspx|website=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Rights Management Services===\n{{Main article|Active Directory Rights Management Services}}\n'''Active Directory Rights Management Services''' ('''AD RMS''', known as '''Rights Management Services''' or '''RMS''' before [[Windows Server 2008]]) is a server software for [[information rights management]] shipped with [[Windows Server]].

The company has four groups with varying permissions to the three shared folders on the network.]]Active Directory structures are arrangements of information about [[Object (computing)|objects]]. The objects fall into two broad categories: resources (e.g., printers) and [[security principal]]s (user or computer accounts and groups). Security principals are assigned unique [[security identifier]]s (SIDs).\n\nEach object represents a single entity\u2014whether a user, a computer, a printer, or a group\u2014and its attributes. Certain objects can contain other objects. An object is uniquely identified by its name and has a set of attributes\u2014the characteristics and information that the object represents\u2014 defined by a [[database schema|schema]], which also determines the kinds of objects that can be stored in Active Directory.\n\nThe [[schema object]] lets administrators extend or modify the schema when necessary. However, because each schema object is integral to the definition of Active Directory objects, deactivating or changing these objects can fundamentally change or disrupt a deployment. Schema changes automatically propagate throughout the system. Once created, an object can only be deactivated\u2014not deleted. Changing the schema usually requires planning.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Windows Server 2003: Active Directory Infrastructure|year=2003|publisher=Microsoft Press|pages=1\u20138\u20131\u20139}}</ref>\n\n===Forests, trees and domains===\nThe Active Directory framework that holds the objects can be viewed at a number of levels. The forest, tree, and domain are the logical divisions in an Active Directory network.\n\nWithin a deployment, objects are grouped into domains. The objects for a single domain are stored in a single database (which can be replicated). Domains are identified by their [[Domain Name System|DNS]] name structure, the [[namespace]].\n\nA domain is defined as a logical group of network objects (computers, users, devices) that share the same Active Directory database.\n\nA tree is a collection of one or more domains and domain trees in a contiguous namespace, and is linked in a transitive trust hierarchy.\n\nAt the top of the structure is the ''forest.'' A forest is a collection of trees that share a common global catalog, directory schema, logical structure, and directory configuration. The forest represents the security boundary within which users, computers, groups, and other objects are accessible.\n\n{| style=\"width:300px; float:right; border:1px solid #ccc; background:#f9f9f9; font-size:88%; line-height:1.5em; margin:5px;\"\n|-\n|| <!-- Table within a table, starts on next line -->\n{|  style=\"margin:auto; border:1px solid darkgrey;\"\n|-\n\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-page url.gif]] ||| Domain-Boston\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-page url.gif]] ||| Domain-New&nbsp;York\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-page url.gif]] ||| Domain-Philly\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-page tree.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | Tree-Southern\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-page url.gif]] ||| Domain-Atlanta\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-page url.gif]] ||| Domain-Dallas\n|}\n|| <!-- Table within a table, starts on next line -->\n{|  style=\"margin:auto; border:1px solid darkgrey;\"\n|-\n|[[File:Icons-mini-page url.gif]]\n| colspan=\"3\" | Domain-Dallas\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | OU-Marketing\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-icon user.gif]] || Hewitt\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-icon user.gif]] || Aon\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-icon user.gif]] ||  Steve\n|-\n| &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-folder.gif]] || colspan=\"2\" | OU-Sales\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-icon user.gif]] || Bill\n|-\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || [[File:Icons-mini-icon user.gif]] || Ralph\n|}\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\"| Example of the geographical organizing of zones of interest within trees and domains.\n|}\n\n====Organizational units====\nThe objects held within a domain can be grouped into [[Organizational Unit]]s (OUs).<ref>{{Cite web | title = Organizational Units | url = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc978003.aspx | work = Distributed Systems Resource Kit ([[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]]) | publisher = Microsoft | quote = An organizational unit in '''Active Directory''' is analogous to a directory in the file system | year = 2011 }}</ref> OUs can provide hierarchy to a domain, ease its administration, and can resemble the organization's structure in managerial or geographical terms. OUs can contain other OUs\u2014domains are containers in this sense. Microsoft recommends using OUs rather than domains for structure and to simplify the implementation of policies and administration. The OU is the recommended level at which to apply [[group policies]], which are Active Directory objects formally named Group Policy Objects (GPOs), although policies can also be applied to domains or sites (see below). The OU is the level at which administrative powers are commonly delegated, but delegation can be performed on individual objects or attributes as well.\n\nOrganizational units do not each have a separate namespace; e.g. user accounts with an identical username (sAMAccountName) in separate OUs within a domain are not allowed, such as \"fred.staff-ou.domain\" and \"fred.student-ou.domain\", where \"staff-ou\" and \"student-ou\" are the OUs. This is because sAMAccountName, a user object attribute, must be unique within the domain.<ref>{{cite web\n        | title      = sAMAccountName is always unique in a Windows domain\u2026 or is it?\n        | url        = http://blog.joeware.net/2012/01/04/2357/\n        | publisher  = Joeware\n        | date       = 4 January 2012\n        | accessdate = 18 September 2013\n        | quote       = examples of how multiple AD objects can be created with the same sAMAccountName}}\n</ref> However, two users in different OUs can have the same Common Name (CN), the name under which they are stored in the directory itself.\n\nIn general the reason for this lack of allowance for duplicate names through hierarchical directory placement, is that Microsoft primarily relies on the principles of [[NetBIOS]], which is a flat-file method of network object management that for Microsoft software, goes all the way back to [[Windows NT 3.1]] and [[MS-DOS]] [[LAN Manager]]. Allowing for duplication of object names in the directory, or completely removing the use of NetBIOS names, would prevent backward compatibility with legacy software and equipment. However, disallowing duplicate object names in this way is a violation of the LDAP RFCs on which Active Directory is supposedly based.\n\nAs the number of users in a domain increases, conventions such as \"first initial, middle initial, last name\" ([[Name order|Western order]]) or the reverse (Eastern order) fail for common [[family names]] like ''Li (\u674e)'', ''Smith'' or ''Garcia''. Workarounds include adding a digit to the end of the username. Alternatives include creating a separate ID system of unique employee/student id numbers to use as account names in place of actual user's names, and allowing users to nominate their preferred word sequence within an [[acceptable use policy]].\n\nBecause duplicate usernames cannot exist within a domain, account name generation poses a significant challenge for large organizations that cannot be easily subdivided into separate domains, such as students in a public school system or university who must be able to use any computer across the network.\n\n=====Shadow groups=====\n[[File:Active directory - OUs can not be given rights to objects.png|thumb|In Active Directory, organizational units (OUs) cannot be assigned as owners or trustees. Only groups are selectable, and members of OUs cannot be collectively assigned rights to directory objects.]]\nIn Microsoft's Active Directory, OUs do not confer access permissions, and objects placed within OUs are not automatically assigned access privileges based on their containing OU. This is a design limitation specific to Active Directory. Other competing directories such as Novell [[Novell eDirectory|NDS]] are able to assign access privileges through object placement within an OU.\n\nActive Directory requires a separate step for an administrator to assign an object in an OU as a member of a group also within that OU. Relying on OU location alone to determine access permissions is unreliable, because the object may not have been assigned to the group object for that OU.\n\nA common workaround for an Active Directory administrator is to write a custom [[PowerShell]] or [[Visual Basic]] script to automatically create and maintain a ''user group'' for each OU in their directory. The scripts are run periodically to update the group to match the OU's account membership, but are unable to instantly update the security groups anytime the directory changes, as occurs in competing directories where security is directly implemented into the directory itself. Such groups are known as ''Shadow Groups''. Once created, these shadow groups are selectable in place of the OU in the administrative tools.\n\nMicrosoft refers to shadow groups in the Server 2008 Reference documentation, but does not explain how to create them. There are no built-in server methods or console snap-ins for managing shadow groups.<ref>Microsoft Server 2008 Reference, discussing shadow groups used for fine-grained password policies: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc770394%28WS.10%29.aspx</ref>\n\nThe division of an organization's information infrastructure into a hierarchy of one or more domains and top-level OUs is a key decision. Common models are by business unit, by geographical location, by IT Service, or by object type and hybrids of these. OUs should be structured primarily to facilitate administrative delegation, and secondarily, to facilitate group policy application.

Microsoft often refers to these partitions as 'naming contexts'.<ref>{{cite web\n        | title      = Active Directory Replication Traffic\n        | url        = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742457.aspx\n        | publisher  = Microsoft Corporation\n        | author     = Andreas Luther\n        | quote      = The Active Directory is made up of one or more naming contexts or partitions.\n        | accessdate =26 May 2010    }}</ref> The 'Schema' partition contains the definition of object classes and attributes within the Forest. The 'Configuration' partition contains information on the physical structure and configuration of the forest (such as the site topology). Both replicate to all domains in the Forest.  The 'Domain' partition holds all objects created in that domain and replicates only within its domain.\n\n==Physical structure==\n''Sites'' are physical (rather than logical) groupings defined by one or more [[Internet Protocol|IP]] subnets.<ref>\n   {{cite web\n        | title     = Sites overview\n        | url       = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782048(WS.10).aspx\n        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation\n        | quote     = A site is a set of well-connected subnets.\n        | date      = 21 January 2005\n    }}\n</ref> AD also holds the definitions of connections, distinguishing low-speed (e.g., [[Wide area network|WAN]], [[Virtual private network|VPN]]) from high-speed (e.g., [[local area network|LAN]]) links. Site definitions are independent of the domain and OU structure and are common across the forest. Sites are used to control network traffic generated by replication and also to refer clients to the nearest [[domain controller]]s (DCs). [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange Server 2007]] uses the site topology for mail routing. Policies can also be defined at the site level.\n\nPhysically, the Active Directory information is held on one or more peer [[domain controller]]s, replacing the [[Windows NT|NT]] [[Primary Domain Controller|PDC]]/[[Backup Domain Controller|BDC]] model. Each DC has a copy of the Active Directory. Servers joined to Active Directory that are not domain controllers are called Member Servers.<ref>{{cite web\n        | title     = Planning for domain controllers and member servers\n        | url       = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc737059(WS.10).aspx\n        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation\n        | quote     = [...] member servers, [...] belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the Active Directory data.\n        | date      = 21 January 2005\n    }}\n</ref> A subset of objects in the domain partition replicate to domain controllers that are configured as global catalogs.

However, to minimize replication traffic and keep the GC's database small, only selected attributes of each object are replicated. This is called the partial attribute set (PAS). The PAS can be modified by modifying the schema and marking attributes for replication to the GC.<ref>{{cite web\n        | title     = Attributes Included in the Global Catalog\n        | url       = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675160%28VS.85%29.aspx\n        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation\n        | date      = 26 August 2010\n        | quote     = The isMemberOfPartialAttributeSet attribute of an attributeSchema object is set to TRUE if the attribute is replicated to the global catalog.

Active Directory is fully integrated with DNS and requires [[TCPIP|TCP/IP]]\u2014DNS. To be fully functional, the DNS server must support [[SRV record|SRV resource records]], also known as service records.\n\n===Replication===\nActive Directory synchronizes changes using ''[[multi-master replication]]''.<ref>{{cite web\n\n        | title     = Directory data store\n        | url       = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc736627(WS.10).aspx\n        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation\n        | quote     = Active Directory uses four distinct directory partition types to store [...] data.

Intrasite replication is frequent and automatic as a result of change notification, which triggers peers to begin a pull replication cycle. Intersite replication intervals are typically less frequent and do not use change notification by default, although this is configurable and can be made identical to intrasite replication.\n\nEach link can have a 'cost' (e.g., [[Digital Signal 3|DS3]], [[Digital Signal 1|T1]], [[ISDN]] etc.) and the KCC alters the site link topology accordingly. Replication may occur transitively through several site links on same-protocol ''site link bridges'', if the cost is low, although KCC automatically costs a direct site-to-site link lower than transitive connections. Site-to-site replication can be configured to occur between a ''bridgehead server'' in each site, which then replicates the changes to other DCs within the site. Replication for Active Directory zones is automatically configured when DNS is activated in the domain based by site.\n\nReplication of Active Directory uses [[Remote Procedure Call]]s (RPC) over IP (RPC/IP). Between Sites [[SMTP]] can be used for replication, but only for changes in the Schema, Configuration, or Partial Attribute Set (Global Catalog) GCs. SMTP cannot be used for replicating the default Domain partition.<ref>{{cite web\n        | title     = What Is Active Directory Replication Topology?\n        | url       = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc775549(WS.10).aspx\n        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation\n        | date      = 28 March 2003\n        | quote     = SMTP can be used to transport nondomain replication [...]    }}</ref>\n\n==Implementation==\nIn general, a network utilizing Active Directory has more than one licensed Windows server computer.

The PDC runs domain specific processes such as the Security Descriptor Propagator (SDP), and is the master time server within the domain. It also handles external trusts, the DFS consistency check, holds current passwords and manages all GPOs as default server.\n|-\n| RID Master\n| 1 per domain\n| Allocates pools of unique identifiers to domain controllers for use when creating objects\n|-\n| Infrastructure Master\n| 1 per domain/partition\n| Synchronizes cross-domain group membership changes.  The infrastructure master should not be run on a global catalog server (GCS) unless all DCs are also GCs, or the environment consists of a single domain.\n\nThe ''Infrastructure Master'' role as described above is only for the domain partition (default naming context), ''netdom query fsmo'' and ''ntdsutil'' will only query the domain partition. However, every application partition, including Forest and Domain-level DNS domain zones has its own Infrastructure Master. The holder of this role is stored in the ''fSMORoleOwner'' attribute of the ''Infrastructure'' object in the root of the partition, it can be modified with ''ADSIEdit'', for example one can modify the ''fSMORoleOwner'' attribute of the ''CN=Infrastructure,DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=yourdomain,DC=tld'' object to ''CN=NTDSSettings,CN=Name_of_DC,CN=Servers,CN=DRSite,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=Yourdomain,DC=TLD''.<ref>[https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/b77a7e5c-590e-4d23-a9cb-8c4c0f403baf/forestdnszones-and-domaindnszones-have-wrong-infrastructure-role-record?forum=winserverDS TechNet: ForestDNSZones and DomainDNSZones have wrong infrastructure role record]</ref>\n|}\n\n==Trusting==\nTo allow users in one domain to access resources in another, Active Directory uses trusts.<ref>{{cite web\n        | title     = Domain and Forest Trusts Technical Reference\n        | url       = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738955(WS.10).aspx\n        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation\n        | date      = 28 March 2003\n        | quote     = Trusts enable [...] authentication and [...] sharing resources across domains or forests}}</ref>\n\nTrusts inside a forest are automatically created when domains are created.

This trust can be used to connect Windows Server 2003 forests if they are operating at the 2003 forest functional level. Authentication across this type of trust is [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]]-based (as opposed to [[NTLM]]).\n\nForest trusts are transitive for all the domains  the trusted forests.  However, forest trusts are ''not'' transitive '''between''' forests.\n\n'''Example''':  Suppose that a two-way transitive forest trust exists between the forest root domains in Forest A and Forest B, and another two-way transitive forest trust exists between the forest root domains in Forest B and Forest C. Such a configuration lets users in Forest B access resources in any domain in either Forest A or Forest C, and users in Forest A or C can access resources in any domain in Forest B. However, it does ''not'' let users in Forest A access resources in Forest C, or vice versa. To let users in Forest A and Forest C share resources, a two-way transitive trust must exist between both forests.\n\n==Management solutions==\nMicrosoft Active Directory management tools include:\n*Active Directory Users and Computers, \n*Active Directory Domains and Trusts, \n*Active Directory Sites and Services, \n*ADSI Edit, \n*Local Users and Groups, \n*Active Directory Schema snap-ins for [[Microsoft Management Console]] (MMC),\n\nThese management tools may not provide enough functionality for efficient workflow in large environments.

He was the foremost figure amongst the [[hypermodernism (chess)|hypermoderns]].\n\n== Life ==\nBorn in Riga, a part of the [[Russian Empire]], the Jewish Yiddish-speaking Nimzowitsch came from a wealthy family, where he learned [[chess]] from his father Shaya Abramovich Nimtsovich (1862, [[Pinsk]] \u2013 ?), who was a timber merchant.

He escaped being drafted into one of the armies by feigning madness, insisting that a fly was on his head. He then escaped to Berlin, and gave his first name as Arnold, possibly to avoid anti-Semitic persecution.<ref>[http://www.chesscafe.com/text/kmoch02.txt Grandmasters I Have Known \u2013 Aaron Nimzovich], by [[Hans Kmoch]], The Chess Cafe</ref>\n\nNimzowitsch eventually moved to [[Copenhagen]] in 1922,<ref name=\"politietsregisterblade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.politietsregisterblade.dk/index.php?option=com_sfup&controller=politregisterblade&task=viewRegisterblad&id=1926810&limitstart=0 |title= Copenhagen Police Record: \"Nimzowitsch, Aron, chess master, born 07-11-1886 in Riga, from 29-11-1922 living c/o Nielsen, Nansensgade 32, 1st floor, from 11-06-1923 at Missionshotellet, L\u00f8ngangstr\u00e6de 27, and from 28-06-1923 c/o Juul, \u00d8ster Farimagsgade 11, 2. floor |publisher=politietsregisterblade.dk|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref> which coincided with his rise to the world chess elite, where he lived for the rest of his life in one small rented room.<ref>[[The Oxford Companion To Chess]], 2nd  Ed.

He obtained Danish citizenship and lived in Denmark until his death in 1935.\n\n== Chess career ==\nThe height of Nimzowitsch's career was the late 1920s and early 1930s. [[Chessmetrics]] places him as the third best player in the world from 1927 to 1931, behind [[Alexander Alekhine]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Capablanca]].<ref>[http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/Summary.asp?Params=192510SSSSS3S000000000000111000000000000010100 Chessmetrics Summary for 1925-35] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502184125/http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/Summary.asp?Params=192510SSSSS3S000000000000111000000000000010100 |date=2 May 2012 }}, [[Chessmetrics]] web site, accessed 7 May 2007.</ref> His most notable successes were first-place finishes at [[Copenhagen]] 1923, [[Marienbad]] 1925, [[Dresden]] 1926, [[Hanover]] 1926, the [[Carlsbad 1929 chess tournament]], and second place behind Alekhine at the [[San Remo 1930 chess tournament]]. Nimzowitsch never developed a knack for match play, though; his best match success was a draw with Alekhine, but the match consisted of only two games and took place in 1914, thirteen years before Alekhine became world champion.\n\nNimzowitsch never beat Capablanca, but fared better against Alekhine. He even beat Alekhine with the [[White and Black in chess|black pieces]], in their short 1914 match at [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. One of Nimzowitsch's most famous games is his celebrated [[Immortal Zugzwang Game|immortal zugzwang game]] against [[Friedrich S\u00e4misch|S\u00e4misch]] at [[Copenhagen]] 1923. Another game on this theme is his win over Paul Johner at [[Dresden]] 1926. When in form, Nimzowitsch was very dangerous with the black pieces, scoring many fine wins over top players.\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{algebraic notation|pos=secright}}\nNimzowitsch is considered one of the most important players and writers in chess history. His works influenced numerous other players, including [[Savielly Tartakower]], [[Milan Vidmar]], [[Richard R\u00e9ti]], [[Akiba Rubinstein]], [[Bent Larsen]] and [[Tigran Petrosian]], and his influence is still felt today.\n\nHe wrote three books on chess strategy: ''[[Mein System]] (My System)'', 1925, ''Die Praxis meines Systems (The Practice of My System)'', 1929, commonly known as ''Chess Praxis'', and ''Die Blockade'' (''The Blockade''), 1925, though much in the latter book is generally held to be a rehash of material already presented in ''Mein System''. ''Mein System'' is considered to be one of the most influential chess books of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nimzowitsch for the 21st Century|author=[[Jacob Aagaard]]|url=http://chesscafe.com/text/skittles311.pdf|format=pdf|publisher=[[Chesscafe.com]]}}</ref> It sets out Nimzowitsch's most important ideas, while his second most influential work, ''Chess Praxis'', elaborates upon these ideas, adds a few new ones, and has immense value as a stimulating collection of Nimzowitsch's own games accompanied by his idiosyncratic, hyperbolic commentary which is often as entertaining as instructive.\n\nNimzowitsch's [[chess theory|chess theories]], when first propounded, flew in the face of widely held orthodoxies enunciated by the dominant theorist of the era, [[Siegbert Tarrasch]], and his disciples. Tarrasch's rigid generalizations drew on the earlier work of [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], and were upheld by Tarrasch's sharp tongue when dismissing the opinions of doubters. While the greatest players of the time, among them [[Alexander Alekhine|Alekhine]], [[Emanuel Lasker]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca|Capablanca]], clearly did not allow their play to be hobbled by blind adherence to general concepts that the center had to be controlled by [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]], that development had to happen in support of this control, that rooks always belong on open files, that wing openings were unsound\u2014core ideas of Tarrasch's chess philosophy as popularly understood\u2014beginners were taught to think of these generalizations as unalterable principles.\n\nNimzowitsch supplemented many of the earlier simplistic assumptions about chess strategy by enunciating in his turn a further number of general concepts of defensive play aimed at achieving one's own goals by preventing realization of the opponent's plans. Notable in his \"system\" were concepts such as [[Glossary of chess#Overprotection|overprotection]] of pieces and pawns under attack, control of the center by pieces instead of pawns, blockading of opposing pieces (notably the [[passed pawns]]) and [[prophylaxis (chess)|prophylaxis]]. He was also a leading exponent of the [[fianchetto]] development of [[bishop (chess)|bishops]]. Perhaps most importantly, he formulated the terminology still in use for various complex chess strategies. Others had used these ideas in practice, but he was the first to present them systematically as a lexicon of themes accompanied by extensive taxonomical observations.\n\n[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] (GM) [[Raymond Keene]] writes that Nimzowitsch \"was one of the world's leading grandmasters for a period extending over a quarter of a century, and for some of that time he was the obvious challenger for the world championship. ... [He was also] a great and profound chess thinker second only to Steinitz, and his works \u2013 ''Die Blockade'', ''My System'' and ''Chess Praxis'' \u2013 established his reputation as one of the father figures of modern chess.\"<ref>Raymond Keene, ''Aron Nimzowitsch: A Reappraisal'', David McKay, 1974, p. 1. {{ISBN|0-679-13040-3}}.</ref> GM [[Robert Byrne (chess player)|Robert Byrne]] called him \"perhaps the most brilliant theoretician and teacher in the history of the game.\"<ref>[[Anthony Saidy]] and [[Norman Lessing]], ''The World of Chess'', Random House, 1974, p. 161. {{ISBN|0-394-48777-X}}.</ref> GM [[Jan Hein Donner]] called Nimzowitsch \"a man who was too much of an artist to be able to prove he was right and who was regarded as something of a madman in his time. He would be understood only long after his death.\"<ref>J. H. Donner, ''The King: Chess Pieces'', New in Chess, 2006, p. 46. {{ISBN|90-5691-171-6}}.</ref>\n\nMany chess openings and variations are named after Nimzowitsch, the most famous being the [[Nimzo-Indian Defence]] (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4) and the less often played [[Nimzowitsch Defence]] (1.e4 Nc6). Nimzowitsch biographer GM Raymond Keene and others have referred to 1.Nf3 followed by 2.b3 as the [[Larsen's Opening|Nimzowitsch\u2013Larsen Attack]]. Keene wrote a book about the opening with that title. These openings all exemplify Nimzowitsch's ideas about controlling the center with pieces instead of pawns. He was also vital in the development of two important systems in the [[French Defence]], the [[French Defence#Winawer Variation: 3...Bb4|Winawer Variation]] (in some places called the Nimzowitsch Variation; its moves are 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4) and the [[French Defence#Advance Variation: 3.e5|Advance Variation]] (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5). He also pioneered two provocative variations of the [[Sicilian Defence]]: the [[Sicilian Defence#2.Nf3: Black's second move alternatives|Nimzowitsch Variation]], 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6, which invites 3.e5 Nd5 (similar to [[Alekhine's Defence]]) and 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 d5?! (the latter regarded as dubious today). International Master [[John L. Watson]] has dubbed the line 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.Nf3 Bb4 the \"Nimzo-English\", employing this designation in Chapter 11 of his book ''Mastering the Chess Openings, Volume 3''.<ref>Gambit Publications, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-904600-98-5}}</ref>\n\n== Personality ==\nThere are many entertaining anecdotes regarding Nimzowitsch\u2014some less savory than others. An article by Hans Kmoch and Fred Reinfeld entitled \"Unconventional Surrender\" on page 55 of the February 1950 ''Chess Review'' tells of the \"... example of Nimzowitsch, who ... once missed first prize in a tournament in Berlin by losing to S\u00e4misch, and when it became clear he was going to lose the game, Nimzowitsch stood up on the table and shouted, 'Gegen diesen Idioten muss ich verlieren!' ('That I should lose to this idiot!')\".\n\nNimzowitsch was annoyed by his opponents' smoking. A popular, but probably apocryphal, story is that once when an opponent laid an unlit cigar on the table, he complained to the tournament arbiters, \"He is threatening to smoke, and as an old player you must know that the threat is stronger than the execution.\"<ref>[[Edward Winter (chess historian)|Edward Winter]], [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/nimzowitsch.html A Nimzowitsch Story]. Retrieved on 2009-03-02.</ref>\n\nNimzowitsch had lengthy and somewhat bitter dogmatic conflicts with Tarrasch over whose ideas constituted 'proper' chess.\n\nNimzowitsch's vanity and faith in his ideas of overprotection provoked [[Hans Kmoch]] to write a parody about him in February 1928 in the ''[[Wiener Schachzeitung]]''. This consisted of a mock game <ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1334664&kpage=1 Game and commentary]</ref> against the fictional player \"Systemsson\", supposedly played and annotated by Nimzowitsch himself. The annotations gleefully exaggerate the idea of overprotection, as well as asserting the true genius of the wondrous idea. Kmoch was in fact a great admirer of Nimzowitsch, and Nimzowitsch was amused at the effort.<ref>The full text of the parody is reprinted at [http://www.chesscafe.com/text/mysyspar.pdf Chesscafe.com] and in Keene's biography on Nimzowitsch (Chapter \"A parody by Hans Kmoch\").</ref>\n\nKmoch also wrote an article about his nine years with Nimzowitsch:<ref name=\"KmochGrandmasters\">[[Hans Kmoch]], [http://www.chesscafe.com/text/kmoch02.pdf Grandmasters I Have Known].

All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront.

It is the only modern language which survived from medieval [[Navarro-Aragonese]] in a form distinctly different from [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\nInformally known as ''fabla'' (\"talk\" or \"speech\"), Aragonese is also commonly referred to by the names of its [[Aragonese language#Dialects|local dialects]] such as ''cheso'' (from [[Valle de Hecho]]) or ''patu\u00e9s'' (from the [[Benasque]] Valley).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Evoluci\u00f3n cheografica de l'aragon\u00e9s.svg|thumb|left|The gradual retreat of Aragonese under the pressure of Castilian.]]\n\nAragonese, which developed in portions of the [[Ebro]] basin, can be traced back to the [[High Middle Ages]]. It spread throughout the [[Pyrenees]] to areas where languages similar to [[Basque language|Basque]] were previously spoken. The [[Kingdom of Aragon]] (formed by the counties of [[County of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Sobrarbe]] and [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagorza]]) expanded southward from the mountains, pushing the [[Moors]] farther south in the ''[[Reconquista]]'' and spreading the Aragonese language.\n\nThe union of the [[Catalonia|Catalan counties]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] which formed the 12th-century [[Crown of Aragon]] did not merge the languages of the two territories; [[Catalan language|Catalan]] continued to be spoken in the east and [[Navarro-Aragonese]] in the west, with boundaries blurred by [[Dialect continuum|dialectal continuity]]. The Aragonese ''Reconquista'' in the south ended with the cession of [[Murcia]] by [[James I of Aragon]] to the [[Kingdom of Castile]] as dowry for an Aragonese princess.\n\nThe best-known proponent of the Aragonese language was [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Heredia|Johan Ferrandez d'Heredia]], the [[Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]] in [[Rhodes]] at the end of the 14th century. He wrote an extensive catalog of works in Aragonese and translated several works from Greek into Aragonese (the first in medieval Europe).\n\nThe spread of Castilian ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] origin of the [[House of Trast\u00e1mara|Trast\u00e1mara dynasty]], and the similarity between Castilian and Aragonese facilitated the recession of the latter. A turning point was the 15th-century coronation of the Castilian [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]], also known as Ferdinand of Antequera.\n\nDuring XVIII century, after the defeat of [[Aragon]] in the [[War of the Spanish Succession|Spanish Sucession War]], [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] order the prohibition of the Aragonese language in the schools of [[Aragon]] and the stablishment of [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]] ([[Spanish language]]) as the only official language in [[Aragon]]. This was ordered in the Aragonese [[Nueva Planta decrees]] (1707).\n\nIn recent times, Aragonese was mostly regarded as a group of rural dialects of Spanish. Compulsory education undermined its already weak position; for example, pupils were punished for using it. However, the 1978 [[Spanish transition to democracy]] heralded literary works and studies of the language.\n\n===Modern Aragonese===\n[[File:Grupos de parlas de l'aragon\u00e9s.svg|270px|alt=Multicolored map of Aragon|thumb|Aragonese dialect map]]\nAragonese is the native language of the Aragonese mountain ranges of the Pyrenees, in the ''[[comarca]]s'' of Somontano, Jacetania, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza. Cities and towns in which Aragonese is spoken are [[Huesca]], [[Graus]], [[Monz\u00f3n]], [[Barbastro]], [[Bielsa]], [[Gista\u00edn|Chist\u00e9n]], [[Fonz, Huesca|Fonz]], [[Echo, Arag\u00f3n, Spain|Echo]], [[Estadilla]], [[Benasque]], [[Campo, Aragon|Campo]], [[Sabi\u00f1\u00e1nigo]], [[Jaca]], [[Plan, Aragon|Plan]], [[Ans\u00f3]], [[Ayerbe]], [[Broto]], and [[El Grado]].\n\nIt is spoken as a second language by inhabitants of [[Zaragoza]], [[Huesca]], [[Ejea de los Caballeros]], or [[Teruel]]. According to recent polls, there are about 25,500 speakers(2011) <ref>[https://zaguan.unizar.es/record/60448] Report about Census of population 2011 of Aragonese Sociolinguistics Seminar and University of Zaragoza </ref> including speakers living outside the native area. \n\nIn 2009, the [[Languages Act of Aragon]] (Law 10/2009) recognized the \"native language, original and historic\" of [[Aragon]].

Some are conservative features that are also shared with the [[Astur-Leonese languages]] and [[Galician-Portuguese]], where Spanish innovated in ways that did not spread to nearby languages.\n\n====Shared with Catalan====\n*Romance initial F- is preserved, e.g. FILIUM > {{lang|an|fillo}} (\"son\", Sp. {{lang|es|hijo}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|fill}}, Pt. {{lang|pt|filho}}).\n*Romance [[palatal approximant]] (GE-, GI-, I-) consistently became medieval {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}, as in medieval Catalan and Portuguese. This becomes modern ''ch'' {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}, as a result of the [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|devoicing]] of sibilants (see below). In Spanish, the medieval result was either {{IPA|[d\u0292]}} (modern {{IPA|[x]}}), {{IPA|[\u029d]}} or nothing, depending on the context. E.g. IUVENEM > {{lang|an|choven}} (\"young man\", Sp. {{lang|es|joven}} {{IPA|/\u02c8xo\u03b2en/}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|jove}} {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0292o\u03b2\u0259/}}), GELARE > {{lang|an|chelar}} (\"to freeze\", Sp. {{lang|es|helar}} {{IPA|/e\u02c8la\u027e/}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|gelar}} {{IPA|/\u0292\u0259\u02c8la/}}).\n*Romance groups -LT-, -CT- result in {{IPA|[jt]}}, e.g. FACTUM > {{lang|an|feito}} (\"done\", Sp. {{lang|es|hecho}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|fet}}, Gal./Port. {{lang|gl|feito}}), MULTUM > {{lang|an|muito}} (\"many\"/\"much\", Sp. {{lang|es|mucho}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|molt}}, Gal. {{lang|gl|moito}}, Port. {{lang|gl|muito}}).\n*Romance groups -X-, -PS-, SCj- result in voiceless palatal fricative ''ix'' {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, e.g. COXU > {{lang|an|coixo}} (\"crippled\", Sp. {{lang|es|cojo}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|coix}}).\n*Romance groups -Lj-, -C'L-, -T'L- result in palatal lateral ''ll'' {{IPA|[\u028e]}}, e.g. MULIERE > {{lang|an|muller}} (\"woman\", Sp. {{lang|es|mujer}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|muller}}), ACUT'LA > {{lang|an|agulla}} (\"needle\", Sp. {{lang|es|aguja}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|agulla}}).\n\n====Shared with Catalan and Spanish====\n\n*Open O, E from Romance result systematically in diphthongs {{IPA|[we]}}, {{IPA|[je]}}, e.g. VET'LA > {{lang|an|viella}} (\"old woman\", Sp. {{lang|es|vieja}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|vella}}). This includes before a palatal approximant, e.g. {{smallcaps|oct\u014d}} > {{lang|an|ueito}} (\"eight\", Sp. {{lang|es|ocho}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|vuit}}). Spanish diphthongizes except before yod, whereas Catalan ''only'' diphthongizes before yod.\n*Loss of final unstressed -E but not -O, e.g. GRANDE > {{lang|an|gran}} (\"big\"), FACTUM > {{lang|an|feito}} (\"done\").  Catalan loses both -O and -E; Spanish preserves -O and sometimes -E.\n\n====Shared with Spanish====\n\n*Former voiced sibilants become voiceless ({{IPA|[z] > [s]}}, {{IPA|[d\u0292] > [t\u0283]}}).\n\n====Shared with neither====\n\n*Latin -B- is maintained in past imperfect endings of verbs of the second and third conjugations: {{lang|an|teneba, teniba}} (\"he had\", Sp. {{lang|es|ten\u00eda}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|tenia}}), {{lang|an|dormiba}} (\"he was sleeping\", Sp. {{lang|es|dorm\u00eda}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|dormia}}).\n*High Aragonese dialects (''alto aragon\u00e9s'') and some dialects of [[Gascon language|Gascon]] have preserved the voicelessness of many intervocalic stop consonants, e.g. CLETAM > {{lang|an|cleta}} (\"sheep hurdle\", Cat. {{lang|ca|cleda}}, Fr. {{lang|fr|claie}}), CUCULLIATAM > ''cocullata'' (\"crested lark\", Sp. {{lang|es|cogujada}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|cogullada}}).\n*Several Aragonese dialects maintain Latin {{smallcaps|-ll-}} as [[Gemination|geminate]] {{IPA|/ll/}}.\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Vowel phonemes\n|-\n!\n![[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Central vowel|Central]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n![[Close vowel|Close]]\n|{{IPA link|i}} || || {{IPA link|u}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n![[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|{{IPA link|e}} || || {{IPA link|o}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n![[Open vowel|Open]]\n| || {{IPA link|a}} ||\n|}\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-\n|+Consonant phonemes \n! colspan=2| \n!

It has a more uniform system of assigning letters to phonemes, with less regard for etymology; words traditionally written with {{angbr|v}} and {{angbr|b}} are uniformly written with {{angbr|b}} in the Uesca system. Similarly, {{angbr|ch}}, {{angbr|j}}, and {{angbr|g}} before {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|i}} are all written {{angbr|ch}}.

Catalan and Occitan influenced Medieval Aragonese, and the Catalan influence continued under the [[Crown of Aragon]] in the [[Ribagor\u00e7an dialect]]. Since the 15th century, Spanish has most influenced Aragonese; it was adopted throughout Aragon as the first language, limiting Aragonese to the northern region surrounding the [[Pyrenees]]. [[French language|French]] has also influenced Aragonese; Italian loanwords have entered through other languages (such as Catalan), and Portuguese words have entered through Spanish. Germanic words came with the conquest of the region by Germanic peoples during the fifth century, and [[English language|English]] has introduced a number of new words into the language.\n\n===Gender===\nWords that were part of the [[Latin declension#Second declension .28o stems.29|Latin second declension]]\u2014as well as words that joined it later on\u2014are usually masculine:\n\n* FILIU(M) > ''fillo'' (son)\n* SCIURU + OLU(M) > ''esquiruelo'' ([[squirrel]])\n\nWords that were part of the [[Latin declension#First declension .28a stems.29|Latin first declension]] are usually feminine:\n* FILIA(M) > ''filla'' (daughter).\n\nSome Latin neuter plural nouns joined the [[Latin declension#First declension .28a stems.29|first declension]] as singular feminine nouns: \n* FOLIA > ''fuella'' (leaf).\n\nWords ending in ''-or'' are feminine:\n* ''a honor'', ''a calor'', ''a color'', and (in Medieval Aragonese) ''la amor''\n\nThe names of fruit trees usually end in ''-era'' (a suffix derived from Latin -ARIA) and are usually feminine:\n* ''a [[Pear|perera]]'', ''a [[Malus|manzanera]]'', ''a [[Juglans regia|nuquera]]'', ''a castanyera'', ''a tellera / o tilero'', ''a [[olive]]ra'', ''a [[Prunus avium|ciresera]]'', ''l'[[Almond|almendrera]]''\n\nThe genders of river names vary:\n\n* Many ending in ''-a'' are feminine: ''a Cinca/a Cinga'', ''a Cinqueta'', ''a Garona'', ''L'Arba'', ''a Noguera'', ''a Isuela'', ''La Uecha'', ''La Uerva'', etc. The latter was known as ''r\u00edo de la Uerba'' during the 16th century.\n* Many from the second and the third declension are masculine: ''L'[[Ebro]]'', ''O [[G\u00e1llego (river)|Galligo]]'', ''O Flumen'', ''L'Alcanadre''.\n\n===Pronouns===\nUnlike most other Ibero-Romance varieties, Aragonese has [[partitive]] and [[locative case|locative]] [[clitic]] pronouns derived from the Latin ''inde'' and ''ibi'': ''en''/''ne'' and ''bi''/''i''/''ie''.\n\nSuch pronouns are present in most major Romance languages ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''en'' and ''hi'', [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ''ne'' and ''i'', French ''en'' and ''y'', and Italian ''ne'' and ''ci''/''vi'').\n\n''En/ne'' is used for:\n* Partitive objects: ''No n'he visto como aquello'' (\"I haven't seen anything like that\", literally 'Not (of it) I have seen like that').\n* Partitive subjects: ''En fa tanto de mal'' (\"It hurts so much\", literally '(of it) it causes so much of pain')\n* [[Ablative case|Ablatives]], places from which movements originate: ''Se'n va ra memoria'' (\"Memory goes away\", literally '(away from [the mind]) memory goes')\n\n''Bi/i/ie'' is used for:\n* Locatives, where something takes place: ''N'ibi heba uno'' (\"There was one of them\"), literally '(Of them) there was one')\n* [[Allative case|Allative]]s, places that movements go towards or end: ''V\u00e9s-be'' ('Go there (imperative)')\n\n=={{anchor|Medieval Ages}}Literature==\n{{Main|Aragonese-language literature}}\nAragonese was not written until the 12th and 13th centuries; the history ''Liber Regum'',<ref name=\"google1\">[https://books.google.com/books?ei=60n0TuPMFtG5hAf4ysDHAQ&hl=es&id=AJYbAAAAIAAJ&dq=literatura+en+aragon%C3%A9s&q=Libre+dels+tres+reys+d%27orient#search_anchor I Curso sobre lengua y literatura en Arag\u00f3n: (Edad Media)]</ref> ''Raz\u00f3n feita d'amor'',<ref name=\"google1\"/> ''Libre dels tres reys d'orient'',<ref name=\"google1\"/> and ''Vida de Santa Mar\u00eda Egipc\u00edaca'' date from this period,<ref name=\"google1\"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LwDJOAAACAAJ&dq=La+vida+de+Santa+Maria+egipciaca&hl=es&sa=X&ei=YEr0ToPVN8uXhQeX2sWfAQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA La vida de Santa Maria Egipciaca: a fourteenth-century translation into Old Castilian from Latin of a work by Paul the Deacon]</ref> there is also an Aragonese version of the [[Chronicle of the Morea#Aragonese text|Chronicle of Morea]], differing also in its content and written in the late 14th century called  ''Libro de los fechos et conquistas del principado de la Morea''.\n\n==={{anchor|Early modern period literature}}Early modern period===\nSince 1500, Spanish was the cultural language of Aragon; many Aragonese wrote in Spanish, and during the 17th century the Argensola brothers went to Castile to teach Spanish.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fSVKAAAAYAAJ&q=hermanos+argensola+ense%C3%B1ar+castellano&dq=hermanos+argensola+ense%C3%B1ar+castellano&hl=es&sa=X&ei=CEv0TrveDYyzhAfL4szDAQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg Alazet: revista de filolog\u00eda, N\u00famero 5]</ref>\nAragonese became a popular village language.<ref>[http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/26/50/097vespertino.pdf El aragon\u00e9s de la  literatura aljamiado-morisca]</ref> During the 17th century, popular literature in the language began to appear.

The first system was successfully deployed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1979.  Motorola and others designed and built the cellular phones for this and other cellular systems.\n\n[[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Martin Cooper]], a former general manager for the systems division at Motorola, led a team that produced the [[Motorola DynaTAC|DynaTAC8000x]], the first commercially available cellular phone small enough to be easily carried, and made the first phone call from it.  He later introduced the so-called [[Motorola Bag Phone|Bag Phone]].\n\nIn 1992 the first [[smartphone]], called [[IBM Simon]], used AMPS.  Frank Canova led its design at [[IBM]] and it was demonstrated that year at the [[COMDEX]] computer-industry trade-show.  A refined version of the product was marketed to consumers in 1994 by [[BellSouth]] under the name [[IBM Simon|Simon Personal Communicator]].  The Simon was the first device that can be properly referred to as a \"smartphone\", even though that term was not yet coined.<ref name=bus_week_2012>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-06-29/before-iphone-and-android-came-simon-the-first-smartphone |title=Before IPhone and Android Came Simon, the First Smartphone |last=Sager |first=Ira |date=2012-06-29 |publisher=Bloomberg L.P |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |accessdate=2012-06-30 |quote=Simon was the first smartphone.

It therefore required considerable [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] for a large number of users. In general terms, AMPS was very similar to the older \"0G\" [[Improved Mobile Telephone Service]], but used considerably more computing power in order to select frequencies, hand off conversations to [[PSTN]] lines, and handle billing and call setup.\n\nWhat really separated AMPS from older systems is the \"back end\" call setup functionality. In AMPS, the cell centers could flexibly assign channels to handsets based on signal strength, allowing the same frequency to be re-used in various locations without interference. This allowed a larger number of phones to be supported over a geographical area. AMPS pioneers coined the term \"cellular\" because of its use of small hexagonal \"cells\" within a system.<ref name=\"bell_young\">W. Rae Young, \"AMPS: Introduction, Background, and Objectives\", Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 58, 1, pages 1-14, January 1979. ''(Note: Young was the Bell Labs engineer who invented the hexagonal cell concept.)''</ref><ref name=\"bell_porter\">Z. C. Fluhr and Philip T. Porter, \"AMPS: Control Architecture\", Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 58, 1, pages 1-14, January 1979. ''(Note: Porter was the Bell Labs engineer who proposed that the cell towers be at the corners of the hexagons rather than the centers and have directional antennas that would transmit/receive in 3 directions into 3 adjacent hexagon cells.)''</ref>\n\nAMPS suffered from many weaknesses compared to today's digital technologies. As an analog standard, it was susceptible to static and noise, and there was no protection from 'eavesdropping' using a [[Scanner (radio)|scanner]].\n\n==Cloning==\nIn the 1990s an epidemic of \"cloning\" cost the cellular carriers millions of dollars.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} An eavesdropper with specialized equipment could intercept a handset's [[Electronic Serial Number|ESN]] (Electronic Serial Number) and MDN or CTN (Mobile Directory Number or Cellular Telephone Number). The Electronic Serial Number, a 12-digit number sent by the handset to the cellular system for billing purposes, uniquely identified that phone on the network. The system then allowed or disallowed calls and or features based on its customer file. A person intercepting an ESN/MDN pair could clone the combination onto a different phone and use it in other areas for making calls without paying.\n\n[[File:2007Computex e21Forum-MartinCooper.jpg|thumb|left| [[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Dr. Martin Cooper]] of Motorola made the first private handheld mobile-phone call on a larger prototype model in 1973. (The image shows a reenactment.)]]\n\nCellular [[phone cloning]] became possible with off-the-shelf technology in the 1990s. Would-be cloners required three key items :\n\n# A radio receiver, such as the Icom PCR-1000, that could tune into the Reverse Channel (the frequency on which AMPS phones transmit data to the tower)\n# A PC with a sound card and a software program called Banpaia\n# A phone that could easily be used for cloning, such as the Oki 900\n\nThe radio, when tuned to the proper frequency, would receive the signal transmitted by the cell phone to be cloned, containing the phone's ESN/MDN pair. This signal would feed into the sound-card audio-input of the PC, and Banpaia would decode the ESN/MDN pair from this signal and display it on the screen. The hacker could then copy that data into the Oki 900 phone and reboot it, after which the phone network could not distinguish the Oki from the original phone whose signal had been received. This gave the cloner, through the Oki phone, the ability to use the mobile-phone service of the legitimate subscriber whose phone was cloned - just as if that phone had been physically stolen, except that the subscriber retained his or her phone, unaware that the phone had been cloned\u2014at least until that subscriber received his or her next bill.\n\nThe problem became so large that some carriers required the use of a [[Personal identification number|PIN]] before making calls. Eventually, the cellular companies initiated a system called RF Fingerprinting, whereby it could determine subtle differences in the signal of one phone from another and shut down some cloned phones. Some legitimate customers had problems with this though if they made certain changes to their own phone, such as replacing the battery and/or antenna. The Oki 900, the ultimate tool of cell-phone hackers, could listen in to AMPS phone-calls right out-of-the-box with no hardware modifications.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Standards==\nAMPS was originally standardized by [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) as EIA/TIA/IS-3. EIA/TIA/IS-3 was superseded by EIA/TIA-553 and TIA interim standard with digital technologies, the cost of wireless service is so low that the problem of cloning <!-- in this what was meant, that cloning was the 'problem'? --> has virtually disappeared.\n\n==Frequency bands==\nAMPS cellular service operated in the 850 [[MHz]] [[Cellular frequencies|Cellular]] band. For each market area, the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) allowed two licensees (networks) known as \"A\" and \"B\" carriers. Each carrier within a market used a specified \"block\" of frequencies consisting of 21 control channels and 395 voice channels. Originally, the B (wireline) side license was usually owned by the local phone company, and the A (non-wireline) license was given to wireless telephone providers.\n\nAt the inception of cellular in 1983, the FCC had granted each carrier within a market 333 channel pairs (666 channels total). By the late 1980s, the cellular industry's subscriber base had grown into the millions across America and it became necessary to add channels for additional capacity. In 1989, the FCC granted carriers an expansion from the previous 666 channels to the final 832 (416 pairs per carrier). The additional frequencies were from the band held in reserve for future (inevitable) expansion. These frequencies were immediately adjacent to the existing cellular band. These bands had previously been allocated to UHF TV channels 70\u201383.\n\nEach duplex channel was composed of 2 [[frequency|frequencies]]. 416 of these were in the 824\u2013849&nbsp;MHz range for transmissions from mobile stations to the base stations, paired with 416 frequencies in the 869\u2013894&nbsp;MHz range for transmissions from base stations to the mobile stations. Each cell site used a different subset of these channels than its neighbors to avoid interference. This significantly reduced the number of channels available at each site in real-world systems. Each AMPS channel had a one way bandwidth of 30&nbsp;kHz, for a total of 60&nbsp;kHz for each duplex channel.\n\nLaws were passed in the US which prohibited the FCC [[type acceptance]] and sale of any receiver which could tune the frequency ranges occupied by analog AMPS cellular services. Though the service is no longer offered, these laws remain in force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/forum/topics/view/112 |work=Forum-General discussion about technology and policy |title=Why are cellular bands blocked on receivers? |publisher=Arrl.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}</ref><ref>47cfr15.121 http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2010/octqtr/47cfr15.121.htm and http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/index.htm?job=service_home&id=cellular</ref>\n\n==Narrowband AMPS==\nIn 1991, Motorola proposed an AMPS enhancement known as narrowband AMPS (NAMPS or N-AMPS).<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/technology/mobile-telephone#ref1079049 Mobile telephone] ''Britannica''.</ref>\n\n==Digital AMPS==\nLater, many AMPS networks were partially converted to [[D-AMPS]], often referred to as '''TDMA''' (though [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] is a generic term that applies to many 2G cellular systems).  D-AMPS, commercially deployed since 1993,<ref>Anton A.

In most areas, D-AMPS is no longer offered and has been replaced by more advanced digital wireless networks.\n\n==Successor technologies==\nAMPS and D-AMPS have now been phased out in favor of either [[CDMA2000]] or [[GSM]], which allow for higher capacity data transfers for services such as [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]], [[Multimedia Messaging System]] (MMS), and wireless Internet access. There are some phones capable of supporting AMPS, D-AMPS and GSM all in one phone (using the [[GAIT (wireless)|GAIT]] standard).\n\n==Analog AMPS being replaced by digital==\nIn 2002, the FCC decided to no longer require A and B carriers to support AMPS service as of February 18, 2008. All AMPS carriers have converted to a digital standard such as CDMA2000 or GSM. Digital technologies such as GSM and CDMA2000 support multiple voice calls on the same channel and offer enhanced features such as two-way text messaging and data services.\n\nUnlike in the United States, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) and [[Industry Canada]] have not set any requirement for maintaining AMPS service in Canada. [[Rogers Wireless]] has dismantled their AMPS (along with [[IS-136]]) network; the networks were shut down May 31, 2007. [[Bell Mobility]] and [[Telus Mobility]], who operated AMPS networks in Canada, announced that they would observe the same timetable as outlined by the FCC in the United States, and as a result would not begin to dismantle their AMPS networks until after February 2008.<ref name=\"sptnews\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sptnews.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=238&Itemid=9 |title=SP&T News |publisher=Sptnews.ca |date=2013-09-21 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}</ref>\n\n[[OnStar]] relied heavily on North American AMPS service for its subscribers because, when the system was developed, AMPS offered the most comprehensive wireless coverage in the US.

As part of the introduction of mobile phone competition in Australia, the Australian government mandated GSM as the new standard for mobile networks, and required that Telstra close the AMPS network by 2000. However, GSM base stations could only serve a limited area. While this was OK for Europe, it meant that GSM could not cover large, sparsely populated rural areas of Australia cost effectively. Telstra deployed a CDMA network, which did not suffer this limitation, and while the AMPS network was closed down at the end of 1999 in the major cities, the closure deadline was extended until the end of 2000 in rural areas to ease the transition to CDMA.

Cayley described many of the concepts and elements of the modern airplane and was the first to understand and explain in engineering terms the concepts of lift and thrust. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920052758/http://centennialofflight.gov/essay/Prehistory/Cayley/PH2.htm |archivedate=20 September 2008 |deadurl=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"AerNav123\">''Cayley, George''. \"On Aerial Navigation\" [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511071413/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }}, [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf Part 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511041814/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }}, [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf Part 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511052409/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }} ''Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy'', 1809\u20131810.

In 1871, [[Francis Herbert Wenham]] constructed the first [[wind tunnel]], allowing precise measurements of aerodynamic forces.

Building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the [[Wright brothers]] flew the first powered airplane on December 17, 1903.\n\nDuring the time of the first flights, [[Frederick W. Lanchester]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Lanchester, F. W. | title=Aerodynamics | year=1907}}</ref> [[Martin Kutta]], and [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]] independently created theories that connected [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, [[Ludwig Prandtl]] is credited with developing the mathematics<ref>{{cite book | author=Prandtl, L. | title=Tragfl\u00fcgeltheorie | publisher=G\u00f6ttinger Nachrichten, mathematischphysikalische Klasse, 451\u2013477 | year=1919}}</ref> behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with [[boundary layer]]s.\n\nAs aircraft speed increased, designers began to encounter challenges associated with air [[compressibility]] at speeds near or greater than the speed of sound.  The differences in air flows under such conditions leds to problems in aircraft control, increased drag due to [[shock wave]]s, and the threat of structural failure due to [[Aeroelasticity|aeroelastic flutter]].  The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the [[Mach number]] after [[Ernst Mach]] who was one of the first to investigate the properties of [[supersonic]] flow. [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] and [[Pierre Henri Hugoniot]] independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a [[shock wave]], while [[Jakob Ackeret]] led the initial work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ackeret, J. | title=Luftkrafte auf Flugel, die mit der grosserer als Schallgeschwindigkeit bewegt werden | journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt |volume=16|pages=72\u201374 | year=1925}}</ref> [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]] and [[Hugh Latimer Dryden]] introduced the term [[transonic]] to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. This rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the [[sound barrier]] was broken for the first time in 1947 using the [[Bell X-1]] aircraft.\n\nBy the time the sound barrier was broken, aerodynamicists' understanding of the subsonic and low supersonic flow had matured. The [[Cold War]] prompted the design of an ever-evolving line of high performance aircraft. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] began as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using computer software, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions.  Understanding of [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] aerodynamics has matured since the 1960s, and the goals of aerodynamicists have shifted from the behavior of fluid flow the engineering of a vehicle such that it interacts pedictably with the fluid flow. Designing aircraft for supersonic and hypersonic conditions, as well as the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems, continues to motivate new research in aerodynamics, while work continues to be done on important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n==Fundamental concepts==\n[[File:aeroforces.svg|thumb|Forces of flight on an [[airfoil]]]]\nUnderstanding the motion of air around an object (often called a flow field)  enables the calculation of forces and [[Moment (physics)|moments]] acting on the object.  In many aerodynamics problems, the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight: [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], [[thrust]], and [[weight]].  Of these, lift and drag are aerodynamic forces, i.e. forces due to air flow over a solid body.  Calculation of these quantities is often founded upon the assumption that the flow field behaves as a continuum. Continuum flow fields are characterized by properties such as [[flow velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and [[temperature]], which may be functions of position and time. These properties may be directly or indirectly measured in aerodynamics experiments or calculated starting with the equations for conservation of mass, [[momentum]], and energy in air flows.  Density, flow velocity, and an additional property, [[viscosity]], are used to classify flow fields. \n\n===Flow classification===\nFlow velocity is used to classify flows according to speed regime. Subsonic flows are flow fields in which the air speed field is always below the local speed of sound. Transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and regions in which the local flow speed is greater than the local speed of sound. Supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere. A fourth classification, hypersonic flow, refers to flows where the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound.  Aerodynamicists disagree on the precise definition of hypersonic flow.\n\n[[Compressibility|Compressible flow]] accounts for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows are often idealized as incompressible, i.e. the density is assumed to be constant. Transonic and supersonic flows are compressible, and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results.\n\nViscosity is associated with the frictional forces in a flow. In some flow fields, viscous effects are very small, and approximate solutions may safely neglect viscous effects. These approximations are called inviscid flows. Flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows. Finally, aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment. External aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes (e.g. around an airplane wing), while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects (e.g. through a jet engine).\n\n====Continuum assumption====\nUnlike liquids and solids, gases are composed of discrete [[molecule]]s which occupy only a small fraction of the volume filled by the gas. On a molecular level, flow fields are made up of the collisions of many individual of gas molecules between themselves and with solid surfaces. However, in most aerodynamics applications, the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored, and the flow field is assumed to behave as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]]. This assumption allows fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere within the flow.\n\nThe validity of the [[continuum assumption]] is dependent on the density of the gas and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the [[mean free path]] length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the mean free path length. For such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000&nbsp;ft/90&nbsp;km)<ref name = \"andersonhist\">{{cite book|last = Anderson|first = John David | title = A History of Aerodynamics and its Impact on Flying Machines| publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1997| location=New York, NY | isbn=0-521-45435-2}}</ref> or satellites in [[Low Earth orbit]]. In those cases, [[statistical mechanics]] is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The [[Knudsen number]] can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.\n\n===Conservation laws===\nThe assumption of  a [[Continuum mechanics|fluid continuum]] allows problems in aerodynamics to be solved using [[Fluid dynamics#Conservation laws|fluid dynamics conservation laws]]. Three conservation principles are used: \n# [[Conservation of mass]]: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation of this principle is known as the [[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|mass continuity equation]], which requires that mass is neither created nor destroyed within a flow of interest.\n# [[Conservation of momentum]]: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation of this principle can be considered an application of [[Newton's Second Law]]. Momentum within a flow is only changed by the work performed on the system by external forces, which may include both [[surface force]]s, such as viscous ([[friction]]al) forces, and [[body force]]s, such as [[gravity|weight]].  The momentum conservation principle may be expressed as either a [[Vector space|vector]] equation or separated into a set of three [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] equations (x,y,z components). In its most complete form, the momentum conservation equations are known as the [[Navier-Stokes equations]].  The Navier-Stokes equations have no known analytical solution and are solved in modern aerodynamics using [[computational fluid dynamics|computational techniques]]. Because of the computational cost of solving these complex equations, simplified expressions of momentum conservation may be appropriate for specific applications. The [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] are a set of momentum conservation equations which neglect viscous forces and may be used in cases where the effect of viscous forces is expected to be small. Additionally, [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli's equation]] is a solution to the momentum conservation equation of an inviscid flow that neglects gravity.\n# [[Conservation of energy]]: The energy conservation equation states that energy is neither created nor destroyed within a flow, and that any addition or subtraction of energy to a volume in the flow is caused by the fluid flow, by [[heat transfer]], or by [[Work (physics)|work]] into and out of the region of interest.\n\nThe [[ideal gas law]] or another such [[equation of state]] is often used in conjunction with these equations to form a determined system that allows the solution for the unknown variables.\n\n==Branches of aerodynamics==\nAerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow, including [[flow speed]], [[compressibility]], and [[viscosity]]. ''External'' aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes. Evaluating the [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on an [[airplane]] or the [[shock wave]]s that form in front of the nose of a [[rocket]] are examples of external aerodynamics. ''Internal'' aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects. For instance, internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a [[jet engine]] or through an [[air conditioning]] pipe.\n\nAerodynamic problems can also be classified according to whether the [[flow speed]] is below, near or above the [[speed of sound]]. A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound, [[transonic]] if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), [[supersonic]] when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and [[hypersonic]] when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition considers flows with [[Mach number]]s above 5 to be hypersonic.<ref name = \"andersonhist\"/>\n\nThe influence of [[viscosity]] on the flow dictates a third classification. Some problems may encounter only very small viscous effects, in which case viscosity can be considered to be negligible. The approximations to these problems are called [[inviscid flow]]s. Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called viscous flows.\n\n===Incompressible aerodynamics===\n{{further information|incompressible flow}}\nAn incompressible flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and space.  Although all real fluids are compressible, a flow is often approximated as incompressible if the effect of the density changes cause only small changes to the calculated results. This is more likely to be true when the flow speeds are significantly lower than the speed of sound. Effects of compressibility are more significant at speeds close to or above the speed of sound.  The [[Mach number]] is used to evaluate whether the incompressibility can be assumed, otherwise the effects of compressibility must be included.\n\n====Subsonic flow====\nSubsonic (or low-speed) aerodynamics describes fluid motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is [[inviscid]], [[Compressibility|incompressible]] and [[irrotational]]. This case is called [[potential flow]] and allows the [[differential equations]] that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of [[fluid dynamics]], thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Joseph|title=Low-speed aerodynamics: From wing theory to panel methods|series=McGraw-Hill series in aeronautical and aerospace engineering|year=1991|publisher=McGraw-Hill\n|location=New York|isbn=0-07-050446-6|oclc=21593499}}</ref>\n\nIn solving a subsonic problem, one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility. Compressibility is a description of the amount of change of [[density]] in the flow. When the effects of compressibility on the solution are small, the assumption that density is constant may be made. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the flow is called compressible. In air, compressibility effects are usually ignored when the [[Mach number]] in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102&nbsp;m) per second or 228 miles (366&nbsp;km) per hour at 60&nbsp;\u00b0F (16&nbsp;\u00b0C)). Above Mach 0.3, the problem flow should be described using compressible aerodynamics.\n\n===Compressible aerodynamics===\n{{main article|Compressible flow}}\nAccording to the theory of aerodynamics, a flow is considered to be compressible if the [[density]] changes along a [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]. This means that \u2013 unlike incompressible flow \u2013 changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the [[Mach number]] in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the [[stagnation point]] (the point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all compressible flows.\n\n====Transonic flow====\n{{main article|Transonic}}\nThe term Transonic refers to a range of flow velocities just below and above the local [[speed of sound]] (generally taken as [[Mach Number|Mach]] 0.8\u20131.2). It is defined as the range of speeds between the [[critical mach|critical Mach number]], when some parts of the airflow over an aircraft become [[supersonic]], and a higher speed, typically near [[Mach number|Mach 1.2]], when all of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds, some of the airflow is supersonic, while some of the airflow is not supersonic.\n\n{{anchor|Supersonic aerodynamics}}<!-- anchor for the link that leads directly to the section -->\n\n====Supersonic flow====\n{{main article|Supersonic}}\nSupersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound. Calculating the lift on the [[Concorde]] during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem.\n\nSupersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow. Fluids react to differences in pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is \"told\" to respond to its environment. Therefore, since [[sound]] is in fact an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, the [[speed of sound]] in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that \"information\" can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself in the case of a fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a [[stagnation pressure]] as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid \"knows\" the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties \u2013 [[temperature]], [[density]], [[pressure]], and [[Mach number]]\u2014in an extremely violent and [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible]] fashion called a [[shock wave]]. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see [[Reynolds number]]) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes.\n\n====Hypersonic flow====\n{{main article|Hypersonic}}\nIn aerodynamics, hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic. In the 1970s, the term generally came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the speed of sound) and above. The hypersonic regime is a subset of the supersonic regime. Hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.\n\n==Associated terminology==\n[[File:Types of flow analysis in fluid mechanics.svg|thumb|Different types flow analysis around an airfoil: \n  {{legend|#f3f3fd|[[Potential flow]] theory}}\n  {{legend|#ff9665|[[Boundary layer|Boundary layer flow]] theory}}\n  {{legend|#3b3bde|[[Turbulence|Turbulent wake]] analysis}}]]\n\nThe incompressible and compressible flow regimes produce many associated phenomena, such as boundary layers and turbulence.\n\n===Boundary layers===\n{{main article|Boundary layer}}\nThe concept of a [[boundary layer]] is important in many problems in aerodynamics. The viscosity and fluid friction in the air is approximated as being significant only in this thin layer. This assumption makes the description of such aerodynamics much more tractable mathematically.\n\n===Turbulence===\n{{main article|Turbulence}}\nIn aerodynamics, turbulence is characterized by chaotic property changes in the flow. These include low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and flow velocity in space and time. Flow that is not turbulent is called [[laminar flow]].\n\n==Aerodynamics in other fields==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n===Engineering design===\n{{Further information|Automotive aerodynamics}}\nAerodynamics is a significant factor in [[Automotive engineering|vehicle design]], including [[automobile]]s, and in the prediction of forces and moments acting on [[sailing|sailing vessels]]. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as [[hard drive]] heads. [[Structural engineering|Structural engineers]] resort to aerodynamics, and particularly [[aeroelasticity]], when calculating [[wind]] loads in the design of large buildings, [[bridge]]s, and [[Wind turbine design|wind turbines]] \n\nThe aerodynamics of internal passages is important in [[HVAC|heating/ventilation]], [[Duct (HVAC)|gas piping]], and in [[Internal combustion engine|automotive engines]] where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.\n\n===Environmental design===\nUrban aerodynamics are studied by [[Urban planning|town planners]] and designers seeking to improve [[amenity]] in outdoor spaces, or in creating urban microclimates to reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes ways in which [[atmospheric circulation]] and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. \n\nAerodynamic equations are used in [[numerical weather prediction]].\n\n===Ball-control in sports===\nSports in which aerodynamics are of crucial importance include [[Association football|soccer]], [[cricket]] and golf, in which control over the trajectory of ball movement is sought by expert players who can, for instance, exploit the \"[[Magnus effect#In sport|Magnus effect]]\" and other environmental conditions to advantage.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aeronautics]]\n* [[Aerostatics]]\n* [[Aviation]]\n* [[Insect flight]] \u2013 how bugs fly\n* [[List of aerospace engineering topics]]\n* [[List of engineering topics]]\n* [[Nose cone design]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n'''General aerodynamics'''\n* {{cite book | author=Anderson, John D.| authorlink=John D.

June 1714) was a German [[baroque]] sculptor and architect, active in the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]], the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Russian Tsardom]].\n\n==Biography==\nAndreas Schl\u00fcter was born probably in [[Hamburg]].<ref>''nach \u00e4lteren Quellen angeblich am 20. Mai 1664 in Hamburg als Sohn des Bildhauers Gerhart Schl\u00fcter geboren'' \u2013 [http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz78554.html#adbcontent ''Andreas Schl\u00fcter''], in: [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]] (ADB). Bd. 55, Leipzig 1910, S. 184\u2013194.</ref> His early life is obscure as at least three different persons of that name are documented. The records of [[St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg]] show that an Andreas Schl\u00fcter, son of sculptor Gerhart Schl\u00fcter, had been baptized there on 22 May 1664. Documents from [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]]/Gda\u0144sk ([[Royal Prussia]]) reported that an Andreas Schl\u00fcter ''(senior)'' had worked 1640\u20131652 in Danzig's Jopengasse lane (today's ulica Piwna). Possibly born in 1640, an ''Andres Schliter'' is recorded as apprentice on 9 May 1656 by the mason's guild. Other sources state 1659 as year of birth.<ref>[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]] online article on [[Zeughaus]] [http://www.dhm.de/magazine/zeughaus/Skulpturenschmuck.html]</ref>\n\nHe probably did spend several years abroad as [[Journeyman]]. His first work, in 1675, may have been epitaphs of the Dukes [[Sambor II, Duke of Pomerania|Sambor]] and [[Mestwin II, Duke of Pomerania|Mestwin]] in the dome of [[Pelplin monastery]].\n\nSchl\u00fcter's first known work was the decoration of the facade of the [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] Royal Chapel, in 1681. He later created statues for King [[John III Sobieski]]'s [[Wilan\u00f3w Palace]] in [[Warsaw]] and sepulchral sculptures in [[Zhovkva Castle|\u017b\u00f3\u0142kiew (Zhovkva)]]. In 1689, he moved to Warsaw and made the [[pediment]] reliefs and sculptural work of [[Jan Dobrogost Krasi\u0144ski|Krasi\u0144ski Palace]].\n\nSchl\u00fcter was invited to [[Berlin]] in 1694 by [[Eberhard von Danckelmann]] to work as court sculptor at the [[Zeughaus|armory (''Zeughaus'')]] for Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III]]. His sculpted decorations are a masterpiece of baroque expression and [[pathos]]. While the more visible reliefs on the outside had to praise fighting, the statues of dying warriors in the interior denounced war and gave an indication of his pacifist religious beliefs (he is said to have been a [[Mennonite]]). Travelling through Italy in 1696, he studied the work of masters like [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].\n\nSchl\u00fcter also worked as an architect and built many state buildings in Berlin in his role as \"Hofbaumeister\" (Court Architect), which he lost when one tower showed signs of a weak fundament. He also served as director of the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] from 1702 to 1704, after which he began concentrating on sculpting again, as \"Hofbildhauer\" (Court Sculptor). His most important [[equestrian sculpture]] is that of the \"Great Elector\", [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William of Brandenburg]], cast in 1708 and placed at \"Lange Br\u00fccke\" near the [[Berlin City Palace]], now situated in the honor court before [[Charlottenburg Palace]].\n\nThe Berlin City Palace, and many of his works, were partially destroyed by bombing in [[World War II]] and by the subsequent [[German Democratic Republic|Communist regime]]. A similar fate probably befell the [[Amber Room]], made between 1701 and 1709, Schl\u00fcter's most famous work of architecture.\n\nIn 1713 Schl\u00fcter's fame brought him to work for Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], where he died of an illness after creating several designs. Together with [[Johann Friedrich Braunstein]], he designed the [[Peterhof Grand Palace|Grand Palace]] and [[Monplaisir Palace]] in [[Peterhof Palace Complex]]. Also the city's oldest building, [[Kikin Hall]], and the reliefs at the [[Summer Palace (Saint Petersburg)|Summer Palace]] are attributed to him. This way he became an important figure of [[Petrine Baroque]].\n\n==Extant works==\n*facade of the Royal Chapel, [[Gda\u0144sk]], 1681\n*sculptures on the [[Facade (Architecture)|facade]] of [[Wilan\u00f3w Palace]], [[Warsaw]], after 1681\n*sculptures on the [[pediment]] of [[Krasi\u0144ski Palace]], Warsaw, 1682-3, 1689\u201393\n*[[epitaph]] of Adam Zygmunt Konarski, St. Mary's Cathedral of the Assumption, [[Frombork]] near Gda\u0144sk, after 1683\n*[[altar]] and crucifix in church, [[W\u0119gr\u00f3w]] near Warsaw, 1688\u201390\n*sepulchral sculptures of the [[Sobieski family]], [[Zhovkva]] near [[Lviv]], 1692\u201393\n*[[altar]] in Czerniak\u00f3w church, Warsaw, 1690\n*portrait bishop Jan Ma\u0142achowski in [[Wawel Cathedral]], [[Krak\u00f3w]] 1693\n*equestrian statue of Elector [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], courtyard of [[Charlottenburg Palace]], Berlin, 1689\u20131703,<ref>[http://gallery.euroweb.hu/html/s/schluter/ Gallery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031221231953/http://gallery.euroweb.hu/html/s/schluter/ |date=21 December 2003 }}</ref> with a copy in the Berlin [[Bode-Museum]]\n*[[:en:amber room|amber room]] (reconstruction) in the [[Catherine Palace]] of [[:en:Tsarskoye Selo|Tsarskoye Selo]] near [[Saint Petersburg]], 1701\n*pulpit, [[:en:St. Mary's Church, Berlin|St. Mary's Church]], Berlin, 1703\n*sarcophagi of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Friedrich I]] and [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover|Sophia Charlotte]], king and queen of Prussia in the [[Berlin Cathedral]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Andreas Schl\u00fcter}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Schl\u00fcter, Andreas}}\n* {{Cite Americana|short=1|wstitle=Schluter, Andreas|year=1920}}\n* {{NDB|23|111|113|Schl\u00fcter, Andreas|Nicolai, Bernd|11860841X}}\n* {{Cite ADB|55|184|194|Andreas Schl\u00fcter|Bruck, Robert|ADB:Schl\u00fcter, Andreas}}\n* [http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~hart/schlueter/schlueter.htm Biography, by Heinz Ladendorf, 1935]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041018202002/http://morgenpost.berlin1.de/archiv2002/020705/politik/story532514.html Article in Morgenpost newspaper]\n* [http://www.dhm.de/magazine/zeughaus/Skulpturenschmuck.html dhm.de: Schl\u00fcter bio at Zeughaus]\n* [http://nevsky-prospekt.com/kikin.html English site about Kikin's Palace (Mansion House)]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schlueter, Andreas}}\n[[Category:1664 births]]\n[[Category:1714 deaths]]\n[[Category:Baroque architects]]\n[[Category:Baroque sculptors]]\n[[Category:Polish architects]]\n[[Category:17th-century German architects]]\n[[Category:18th-century German architects]]\n[[Category:Russian architects]]\n[[Category:Polish sculptors]]\n[[Category:17th-century German sculptors]]\n[[Category:German male sculptors]]\n[[Category:18th-century German sculptors]]\n[[Category:Russian sculptors]]\n[[Category:Russian male sculptors]]\n[[Category:People from Gda\u0144sk]]\n[[Category:People from Hamburg]]\n[[Category:People from Royal Prussia]]", "sha1": "dzqtfabz8c8lq5q2fjo8wxi4ycfiqev"}}, {"title": "Axiomatic Set Theory", "ns": "0", "id": "2821", "redirect": {"title": "Set theory"}, "revision": {"id": "783846889", "parentid": "743674885", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T01:22:25Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Set theory#Axiomatic set theory]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from other capitalisation}}\n}}", "sha1": "qno69rh148d7zoe20oxk24lpb8l7tes"}}, {"title": "Ash", "ns": "0", "id": "2822", "revision": {"id": "862006885", "parentid": "862004435", "timestamp": "2018-10-01T15:31:00Z", "contributor": {"username": "AnomieBOT", "id": "7611264"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Dating maintenance tags: {{Cn}}", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Wood ash.jpg|thumb|Wood ash]]\n'''Ash''' or '''ashes''' are the solid remains of [[fire]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ash|title=the definition of ash|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}</ref> Specifically, it refers to all non-[[aqueous]], non-[[gas]]eous residues that remain after something is [[combustion|burned]].

This can be stated symbolically as <math>F' = f</math>.<ref>{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=6th | year=2008 | isbn=0-495-01166-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1=Larson | first1=Ron | authorlink=Ron Larson (mathematician)| last2=Edwards | first2=Bruce H. | title=Calculus | publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=9th | year=2009 | isbn=0-547-16702-4}}</ref> The process of solving for antiderivatives is called '''antidifferentiation''' (or '''indefinite integration''') and its opposite operation is called differentiation, which is the process of finding a derivative.\n\nAntiderivatives are related to [[integral|definite integral]]s through the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]: the definite integral of a function over an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nThe discrete equivalent of the notion of antiderivative is [[antidifference]].\n\n==Example==\nThe function <math>F(x) = \\frac{x^3}{3}</math> is an antiderivative of <math>f(x) = x^2</math>, as the derivative of <math>\\frac{x^3}{3}</math> is <math>x^2</math>. As the derivative of a [[Constant function|constant]] is [[0 (number)|zero]], <math>x^2</math> will have an [[Infinite set|infinite]] number of antiderivatives, such as <math>\\frac{x^3}{3}</math>, <math>\\frac{x^3}{3}+1</math>, <math>\\frac{x^3}{3}-2</math>, etc. Thus, all the antiderivatives of <math>x^2</math> can be obtained by changing the value of {{math|''c''}} in <math>F(x) = \\frac{x^3}{3}+c</math>, where {{math|''c''}} is an arbitrary constant known as the [[constant of integration]]. Essentially, the [[graph of a function|graphs]] of antiderivatives of a given function are [[vertical translation]]s of each other; each graph's vertical location depending upon the [[Value (mathematics)|value]] {{math|''c''}}.\n\nIn physics, the integration of acceleration yields velocity plus a constant. The constant is the initial velocity term that would be lost upon taking the derivative of velocity because the derivative of a constant term is zero. This same pattern applies to further integrations and derivatives of motion (position, velocity, acceleration, and so on).\n\n==Uses and properties==\nAntiderivatives can be used to [[integral#Calculating integrals|compute definite integrals]], using the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]: if {{math|''F''}} is an antiderivative of the [[Riemann integral|integrable]] function {{math|''f''}} over the interval <math>[a,b]</math>, then:\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx = F(b) - F(a).</math>\n\nBecause of this, each of the infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function {{math|''f''}} is sometimes called the \"general integral\" or \"indefinite integral\" of ''f'' and is written using the integral symbol with no bounds:\n:<math>\\int f(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nIf {{math|''F''}} is an antiderivative of {{math|''f''}}, and the function {{math|''f''}} is defined on some interval, then every other antiderivative {{math|''G''}} of {{math|''f''}} differs from {{math|''F''}} by a constant: there exists a number {{math|''c''}} such that <math>G(x) = F(x)+c</math> for all {{math|''x''}}. {{math|''c''}} is called the [[constant of integration]]. If the domain of {{math|''F''}} is a [[disjoint union]] of two or more (open) intervals, then a different constant of integration may be chosen for each of the intervals. For instance\n\n:<math>F(x)=\\begin{cases}-\\frac{1}{x}+c_1\\quad x<0\\\\-\\frac{1}{x}+c_2\\quad x>0\\end{cases}</math>\n\nis the most general antiderivative of <math>f(x)=1/x^2</math> on its natural domain <math>(-\\infty,0)\\cup(0,\\infty).</math>\n\nEvery [[continuous function]] {{math|''f''}} has an antiderivative, and one antiderivative {{math|''F''}} is given by the definite integral of {{math|''f''}} with variable upper boundary:\n:<math>F(x)=\\int_0^x f(t)\\,dt.</math>\nVarying the lower boundary produces other antiderivatives (but not necessarily all possible antiderivatives). This is another formulation of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]].\n\nThere are many functions whose antiderivatives, even though they exist, cannot be expressed in terms of [[elementary function]]s (like [[polynomial]]s, [[exponential function]]s, [[logarithm]]s, [[trigonometric functions]], [[inverse trigonometric functions]] and their combinations). Examples of these are\n:<math>\\int e^{-x^2}\\,dx,\\qquad \\int \\sin x^2\\,dx, \\qquad\\int \\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\,dx,\\qquad \\int\\frac{1}{\\ln x}\\,dx,\\qquad \\int x^{x}\\,dx.</math>\n''From left to right, the first four are the [[error function]], the [[Fresnel function]], the [[trigonometric integral]], and the [[logarithmic integral function]].''\n\nSee also [[Differential Galois theory]] for a more detailed discussion.\n\n==Techniques of integration==\nFinding antiderivatives of elementary functions is often considerably harder than finding their derivatives. For some elementary functions, it is impossible to find an antiderivative in terms of other elementary functions. See the articles on [[Elementary function (differential algebra)|elementary functions]] and [[nonelementary integral]] for further information.\n\nThere are various methods available:\n\n* the [[linearity of integration]] allows us to break complicated integrals into simpler ones\n* [[integration by substitution]], often combined with [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]] or the [[natural logarithm]]\n** the [[inverse chain rule method]], a special case of integration by substitution\n* [[integration by parts]] to integrate products of functions\n* [[Inverse function integration]], a formula that expresses the antiderivative of the inverse <math>f^{-1}</math> of an invertible and continuous function <math>f</math> in terms of the antiderivative of <math>f</math> and of <math>f^{-1}</math>.\n* the method of [[partial fractions in integration]] allows us to integrate all [[rational function]]s (fractions of two polynomials)\n* the [[Risch algorithm]]\n* when integrating multiple times, certain additional techniques can be used, see for instance [[double integral]]s and [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] and the [[Stokes' theorem]]\n* if a function has no elementary antiderivative (for instance, <math>\\exp (-x^2)</math>), its definite integral can be approximated using [[numerical integration]]\n* it is often convenient to algebraically manipulate the integrand such that other integration techniques, such as integration by substitution, may be used.\n* to calculate the ({{math|''n''}} times) repeated antiderivative of a function {{math|''f''}}, [[Cauchy]]'s formula is useful (cf. [[Cauchy formula for repeated integration]]):\n::<math>\\int_{x_0}^x \\int_{x_0}^{x_1} \\dots \\int_{x_0}^{x_{n-1}} f(x_n) \\,dx_n \\dots \\, dx_2\\, dx_1= \\int_{x_0}^x f(t) \\frac{(x-t)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}\\,dt.</math>\n\n[[Computer algebra system]]s can be used to automate some or all of the work involved in the symbolic techniques above, which is particularly useful when the algebraic manipulations involved are very complex or lengthy. Integrals which have already been derived can be looked up in a [[table of integrals]].\n\n==Of non-continuous functions==\nNon-continuous functions can have antiderivatives. While there are still open questions in this area, it is known that:\n* Some highly [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological functions]] with large sets of discontinuities may nevertheless have antiderivatives.\n* In some cases, the antiderivatives of such pathological functions may be found by [[Riemann integral|Riemann integration]], while in other cases these functions are not Riemann integrable.\n\nAssuming that the domains of the functions are open intervals:\n* A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a function {{math|''f''}} to have an antiderivative is that {{math|''f''}} have the [[intermediate value theorem|intermediate value property]]. That is, if <math>[a,b]</math> is a subinterval of the domain of {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''c''}} is any real number between {{math|''f''(''a'')}} and {{math|''f''(''b'')}}, then <math>f(c) = c</math> for some {{math|''c''}} between {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}. This is a consequence of [[Darboux's theorem (analysis)|Darboux's theorem]].\n* The set of discontinuities of {{math|''f''}} must be a [[meagre set]]. This set must also be an [[F-sigma]] set (since the set of discontinuities of any function must be of this type). Moreover, for any meagre F-sigma set, one can construct some function {{math|''f''}} having an antiderivative, which has the given set as its set of discontinuities.\n* If {{math|''f''}} has an antiderivative, is [[bounded function|bounded]] on closed finite subintervals of the domain and has a set of discontinuities of [[Lebesgue measure]] 0, then an antiderivative may be found by integration in the sense of Lebesgue. In fact, using more powerful integrals like the [[Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral]], every function for which an antiderivative exists is integrable, and its general integral coincides with its antiderivative.\n* If {{math|''f''}} has an antiderivative {{math|''F''}} on a closed interval <math>[a,b]</math>, then for any choice of partition <math>a=x_0<x_1<x_2<\\dots<x_n=b</math>, if one chooses sample points <math>x_i^*\\in[x_{i-1},x_i]</math> as specified by the [[mean value theorem]], then the corresponding Riemann sum [[telescoping series|telescopes]] to the value <math>F(b)-F(a)</math>.\n\n:: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*)(x_i-x_{i-1}) & = \\sum_{i=1}^n [F(x_i)-F(x_{i-1})] \\\\\n& = F(x_n)-F(x_0) = F(b)-F(a)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n:However if {{math|''f''}} is unbounded, or if {{math|''f''}} is bounded but the set of discontinuities of {{math|''f''}} has positive Lebesgue measure, a different choice of sample points <math>x_i^*</math> may give a significantly different value for the Riemann sum, no matter how fine the partition. See Example 4 below.\n\n===Some examples===\n{{ordered list\n|1= The function\n:<math>f(x)=2x\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)-\\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)</math>\n\nwith <math>f\\left(0\\right)=0</math> is not continuous at <math>x=0</math> but has the antiderivative\n\n:<math>F\\left(x\\right)=x^2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)</math>\n\nwith <math>F\\left(0\\right)=0</math>. Since {{math|''f''}} is bounded on closed finite intervals and is only discontinuous at 0, the antiderivative {{math|''F''}} may be obtained by integration: <math>F(x)=\\int_0^x f(t)\\,dt</math>.\n|2= The function\n\n:<math>f(x)=2x\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)-\\frac{2}{x}\\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)</math>\n\nwith <math>f\\left(0\\right)=0</math> is not continuous at <math>x=0</math> but has the antiderivative\n\n:<math>F(x)=x^2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)</math>\n\nwith <math>F\\left(0\\right)=0</math>. Unlike Example 1, {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is unbounded in any interval containing 0, so the Riemann integral is undefined.\n\n|3= If {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is the function in Example 1 and {{math|''F''}} is its antiderivative, and <math>\\{x_n\\}_{n\\ge1}</math> is a [[dense set|dense]] [[countable]] [[subset]] of the open interval <math>\\left(-1,1\\right)</math>, then the function\n\n:<math>g(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{f(x-x_n)}{2^n}</math>\n\nhas an antiderivative\n\n:<math>G(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{F(x-x_n)}{2^n}.</math>\n\nThe set of discontinuities of {{math|''g''}} is precisely the set <math>\\{x_n\\}_{n\\ge1}</math>. Since {{math|''g''}} is bounded on closed finite intervals and the set of discontinuities has measure 0, the antiderivative {{math|''G''}} may be found by integration.\n\n|4= Let <math>\\{x_n\\}_{n\\ge1}</math> be a [[dense set|dense]] [[countable]] subset of the open interval <math>\\left(-1,1\\right)</math>. Consider the everywhere continuous strictly increasing function\n\n:<math>F(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{2^n}(x-x_n)^{1/3}.</math>\n\nIt can be shown that\n\n:<math>F'(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{3\\cdot2^n}(x-x_n)^{-2/3}</math>\n[[Image:Antideriv1.png|125px|right|thumb|Figure 1.]]\n[[Image:Antideriv2.png|thumb|right|125px|Figure 2.]]\n\nfor all values {{math|''x''}} where the series converges, and that the graph of {{math|''F''(''x'')}} has vertical tangent lines at all other values of {{math|''x''}}. In particular the graph has vertical tangent lines at all points in the set <math>\\{x_n\\}_{n\\ge1}</math>.\n\nMoreover <math>F\\left(x\\right)\\ge0</math> for all {{math|''x''}} where the derivative is defined. It follows that the inverse function <math>G=F^{-1}</math> is differentiable everywhere and that\n\n:<math>g\\left(x\\right)=G'\\left(x\\right)=0</math>\n\nfor all {{math|''x''}} in the set <math>\\{F(x_n)\\}_{n\\ge1}</math> which is dense in the interval <math>\\left[F\\left(-1\\right),F\\left(1\\right)\\right]</math>. Thus {{math|''g''}} has an antiderivative {{math|''G''}}. On the other hand, it can not be true that\n\n:<math>\\int_{F(-1)}^{F(1)}g(x)\\,dx=GF(1)-GF(-1)=2,</math>\n\nsince for any partition of <math>\\left[F\\left(-1\\right),F\\left(1\\right)\\right]</math>, one can choose sample points for the Riemann sum from the set <math>\\{F(x_n)\\}_{n\\ge1}</math>, giving a value of 0 for the sum. It follows that {{math|''g''}} has a set of discontinuities of positive Lebesgue measure. Figure 1 on the right shows an approximation to the graph of {{math|''g''(''x'')}} where <math>\\{x_n=\\cos(n)\\}_{n\\ge1}</math> and the series is truncated to 8 terms. Figure 2 shows the graph of an approximation to the antiderivative {{math|''G''(''x'')}}, also truncated to 8 terms. On the other hand if the Riemann integral is replaced by the [[Lebesgue integral]], then [[Fatou's lemma]] or the [[dominated convergence theorem]] shows that {{math|''g''}} does satisfy the fundamental theorem of calculus in that context.\n\n|5= In Examples 3 and 4, the sets of discontinuities of the functions {{math|''g''}} are dense only in a finite open interval <math>\\left(a,b\\right)</math>. However, these examples can be easily modified so as to have sets of discontinuities which are dense on the entire real line <math>(-\\infty,\\infty)</math>. Let\n:<math>\\lambda(x) = \\frac{a+b}{2} + \\frac{b-a}{\\pi}\\tan^{-1} x.</math>\nThen <math>g\\left(\\lambda(x)\\right)\\lambda'(x)</math> has a dense set of discontinuities on <math>(-\\infty,\\infty)</math> and has antiderivative <math>G\\cdot\\lambda.</math>\n\n|6= Using a similar method as in Example 5, one can modify {{math|''g''}} in Example 4 so as to vanish at all [[rational numbers]]. If one uses a naive version of the [[Riemann integral]] defined as the limit of left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums over regular partitions, one will obtain that the integral of such a function {{math|''g''}} over an interval <math>\\left[a,b\\right]</math> is 0 whenever {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are both rational, instead of <math>G\\left(b\\right)-G\\left(a\\right)</math>. Thus the fundamental theorem of calculus will fail spectacularly.\n\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Antiderivative (complex analysis)]]\n* [[Lists of integrals]]\n* [[Symbolic integration]]\n* [[Area]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n<div class=\"references\">\n<references />\n</div>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Introduction to Classical Real Analysis'', by Karl R.

The musical arrangement was attributed to [[Louis Le Maire]] (sometimes Lemaire), an 18th-century composer. This was \"Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1835, by C.

In [[England]], an Oath of Abjuration was taken by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]], clergy, and laymen, pledging to support the current [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] and repudiated the right of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] and other claimants to the throne. This oath was imposed under [[William III of England|William III]], [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].

BY MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT. PRINTED AT BOSTON, BY PETER EDES FOR THOMAS AND ANDREWS, Faust's Statue, No. 45, Newbury-Street, MDCCXCII.\"|Title page from the first American edition of ''Rights of Woman'']]\n\n'''''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects''''' (1792), written by the 18th-century British [[proto-feminist]] [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], is one of the earliest works of [[feminist philosophy]]. In it, Wollstonecraft responds to those educational and political theorists of the 18th century who did not believe women should have an education. She argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be \"companions\" to their husbands, rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men.\n\nWollstonecraft was prompted to write the ''Rights of Woman'' after reading [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]]'s 1791 report to the French [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], which stated that women should only receive a domestic education; she used her commentary on this specific event to launch a broad attack against sexual double standards and to indict men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the ''Rights of Woman'' hurriedly to respond directly to ongoing events; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it.\n\nWhile Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal. Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her. Although it is commonly assumed now that the ''Rights of Woman'' was unfavourably received, this is a modern misconception based on the belief that Wollstonecraft was as reviled during her lifetime as she became after the publication of [[William Godwin]]'s ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1798). The ''Rights of Woman'' was actually well received when it was first published in 1792. One biographer has called it \"perhaps the most original book of [Wollstonecraft's] century\".<ref>Sunstein, 3.</ref>\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:Talleyrand 01.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Portrait of a man, showing his head and shoulders. He is wearing a black jacket with a high-necked collar and a white shirt tied in a bow. His head is adorned by a curly blonde wig.|[[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]], by [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]]]]\n''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' was written against the tumultuous background of the [[French Revolution]] and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the ''[[Revolution controversy]]'', British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the separation of church and state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'', a response to [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790).<ref name=MS1112>Macdonald and Scherf, \"Introduction\", 11\u201312.</ref> In his ''Reflections'', Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131651) in which [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In ''Reflections'' he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged\u2014the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's ''Rights of Men'', published just six weeks after Burke's ''Reflections'', is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 43\u201344.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]] presented his ''Rapport sur l'instruction publique'' (1791) to the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in France, Wollstonecraft was galvanized to respond.<ref>Kelly, 107; Sapiro, 26\u201327.</ref> In his recommendations for a national system of education, Talleyrand had written:\n<blockquote>\nLet us bring up women, not to aspire to advantages which the Constitution denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Men are destined to live on the stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.<ref>Talleyrand, \"Rapport sur l'instruction publique\", reprinted in ''Vindications'', 394\u201395.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[File:Marie-Olympe-de-Gouges.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Portrait of a woman, showing her head, with a grey wig. Two large curls are sitting at the nape of her neck. Her shoulders are covered with a filmy, cream-coloured shawl.|[[Olympe de Gouges]]]]\nWollstonecraft dedicated the ''Rights of Woman'' to Talleyrand: \"Having read with great pleasure a pamphlet which you have lately published, I dedicate this volume to you; to induce you to reconsider the subject, and maturely weigh what I have advanced respecting the rights of woman and national education.\"<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 101.</ref> At the end of 1791, French feminist [[Olympe de Gouges]] had published her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'', and the question of women's rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain.<ref name=MS1112/>\n\nThe ''Rights of Woman'' is an extension of Wollstonecraft's arguments in the ''Rights of Men''. In the ''Rights of Men'', as the title suggests, she is concerned with the rights of particular men (18th-century British men) while in the ''Rights of Woman'', she is concerned with the rights afforded to \"woman\", an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter of the ''Rights of Woman'' addresses the issue of [[natural rights]] and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin.<ref>Taylor, 105\u20136; Kelly, 107.</ref> ''The Rights of Woman'' thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by [[Political philosophy|political philosophers]] such as [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].<ref>Sapiro, 182\u201384.</ref>\n\n==Themes of writings==\nWollstonecraft did not employ the formal argumentation or logical prose style common to 18th-century philosophical writing when composing her own works. The ''Rights of Woman'' is a long essay that introduces all of its major topics in the opening chapters and then repeatedly returns to them, each time from a different point of view. It also adopts a hybrid tone that combines rational argument with the fervent rhetoric of [[sensibility]].<ref name=K110>Kelly, 110.</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, ''sensibility'' was a physical phenomenon that came to be attached to a specific set of moral beliefs. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men.<ref name=BB9>Barker-Benfield, 9.</ref> The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathise with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the [[abolitionism|movement to abolish the slave trade]].<ref>Barker-Benfield, 224.</ref> But sensibility also paralysed those who had too much of it; as scholar G. J. Barker-Benfield explains, \"an innate refinement of nerves was also identifiable with greater suffering, with weakness, and a susceptibility to disorder\".<ref name=BB9/>\n\nBy the time Wollstonecraft was writing the ''Rights of Woman'', sensibility had already been under sustained attack for a number of years.<ref>Todd, ''Sensibility'', 144.</ref> Sensibility, which had initially promised to draw individuals together through sympathy, was now viewed as \"profoundly separatist\"; novels, plays, and poems that employed the language of sensibility asserted individual rights, sexual freedom, and unconventional familial relationships based only upon feeling.<ref>Todd, ''Sensibility'', 136.</ref> Furthermore, as [[Janet Todd]], another scholar of sensibility, argues, \"to many in Britain the cult of sensibility seemed to have feminized the nation, given women undue prominence, and emasculated men.\"<ref>Todd, ''Sensibility'', 133.</ref>\n\n===Rational education===\nOne of Wollstonecraft's central arguments in the ''Rights of Woman'' is that women should be educated in a rational manner to give them the opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and [[conduct book]] writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books,<ref>Batchelor, Jennie. \"[http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&UID=216 Conduct Book].\" ''The Literary Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 14 May 2007.</ref> that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as [[Catharine Macaulay]] and [[Hester Chapone]], maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, ''[[Thoughts on the Education of Daughters]]'' (1787), in her children's book, ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (1788), as well as in the ''Rights of Woman''.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 169ff; Kelly, 123; Taylor, 14\u201315; Sapiro, 27\u201328; 243\u201344.</ref>\n\nStating in her preface that \"my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if [woman] be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all\", Wollstonecraft contends that society will degenerate without educated women, particularly because mothers are the primary educators of young children.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 102; Sapiro, 154\u201355.</ref> She attributes the problem of uneducated women to men and \"a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who [consider] females rather as women than human creatures\".<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 109.</ref> Women are capable of rationality; it only appears that they are not, because men have refused to educate them and encouraged them to be frivolous (Wollstonecraft describes silly women as \"spaniels\" and \"toys\"<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 144.</ref>).<ref>Kelly, 124\u201326; Taylor, 234\u201337; Sapiro, 129\u201330.</ref> While stressing it is of the same kind, she entertains the notion that women might not be able to attain the same degree of knowledge that men do.<ref name=Tong>{{cite book|author=Tong, Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|edition=3|publisher=Westview Press (Perseus Books)|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|page=20}}</ref>\n\nWollstonecraft attacks conduct book writers such as [[James Fordyce]] and [[John Gregory (moralist)|John Gregory]] as well as educational philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] who argue that a woman does not need a rational education. (Rousseau famously argues in ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men; Wollstonecraft, infuriated by this argument, attacks not only it but also Rousseau himself.<ref>Kelly, 126; Taylor, 14\u201315; Sapiro, 130\u201331.</ref>) Intent on illustrating the limitations that contemporary educational theory placed upon women, Wollstonecraft writes, \"taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison\",<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 157.</ref> implying that without this damaging ideology, which encourages young women to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, they could achieve much more. Wives could be the rational \"companions\" of their husbands and even pursue careers should they so choose: \"women might certainly study the art of healing, and be physicians as well as nurses. And midwifery, decency seems to [[wikt:allot|allot]] to them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they might, also, study politics&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Business of various kinds, they might likewise pursue.\"<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 286; see also Kelly, 125\u201324; Taylor, 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nFor Wollstonecraft, \"the most perfect education\" is \"an exercise of the understanding as is best calculated to strengthen the body and form the heart. Or, in other words, to enable the individual to attach such habits of virtue as will render it independent.\"<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 129.</ref> In addition to her broad philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft lays out a specific plan for national education to counter [[Talleyrand]]'s. In Chapter 12, \"On National Education,\" she proposes that children be sent to [[day school]]s as well as given some education at home \"to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures,\" and that such schools be free for children \"five to nine years of age.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/wollstonecraft_on_national_education.htm |title=Mary Wollstonecraft \u2013 on national education |publisher=Infed.org |accessdate=13 February 2014}}</ref> She also maintains that schooling should be [[coeducation|co-educational]], contending that men and women, whose marriages are \"the cement of society,\" should be \"educated after the same model.\"<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', Chapter 12; see also, Kelly, 124\u201325; 133\u201334; Sapiro, 237ff.</ref>\n\n===Feminism writings===\n[[File:Johann Heinrich F\u00fcssli 049.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Three women sitting around a small table, one sewing, one sitting in front of a small cup.

New York: Praeger Publishers, 1972; p. 217. {{LCCN|72077546}}.</ref>]]\nIt is debatable to what extent the ''Rights of Woman'' is a [[feminist]] text; because the definitions of ''feminist'' vary, different scholars have come to different conclusions. Wollstonecraft would never have referred to her text as feminist because the words ''feminist'' and ''feminism'' were not coined until the 1890s.<ref>''Feminist'' and ''feminism''. ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Retrieved 17 September 2007.</ref> Moreover, there was no [[feminist movement]] to speak of during Wollstonecraft's lifetime. In the introduction to her seminal work on Wollstonecraft's thought, [[Barbara Taylor]] writes:\n<blockquote>\nDescribing [Wollstonecraft's philosophy] as feminist is problematic, and I do it only after much consideration. The label is of course anachronistic&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Treating Wollstonecraft's thought as an anticipation of nineteenth and twentieth-century feminist argument has meant sacrificing or distorting some of its key elements. Leading examples of this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have been the widespread neglect of her religious beliefs, and the misrepresentation of her as a bourgeois liberal, which together have resulted in the displacement of a religiously inspired utopian radicalism by a secular, class-partisan reformism as alien to Wollstonecraft's political project as her dream of a divinely promised age of universal happiness is to our own. Even more important however has been the imposition on Wollstonecraft of a heroic-individualist brand of politics utterly at odds with her own ethically driven case for women's emancipation. Wollstonecraft's leading ambition for women was that they should attain virtue, and it was to this end that she sought their liberation.<ref>Taylor, 12; see also, 55\u201357; see also Sapiro, 257\u201359.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn the ''Rights of Woman'', Wollstonecraft does not make the claim for gender equality using the same arguments or the same language that late 19th- and 20th century feminists later would. For instance, rather than unequivocally stating that men and women are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law.<ref>See, for example, Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 126, 146; Taylor, 105\u2013106; 118\u201320.</ref> For Wollstonecraft, men and women are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to 21st-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the 18th century. For example, it implied that both men and women\u2014not just women\u2014should be modest<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 102 and 252.</ref> and respect the sanctity of marriage.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 274.</ref> Wollstonecraft's argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late 18th century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.\n\nHowever, Wollstonecraft's arguments for equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 110; Sapiro, 120\u201321.</ref> Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously states:\n<blockquote>\nLet it not be concluded, that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 135.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nMoreover, Wollstonecraft calls on men, rather than women, to initiate the social and political changes she outlines in the ''Rights of Woman''. Because women are uneducated, they cannot alter their own situation\u2014men must come to their aid.<ref>Poovey, 79; Kelly, 135.</ref> Wollstonecraft writes at the end of her chapter \"Of the Pernicious Effects Which Arise from the Unnatural Distinctions Established in Society\":\n<blockquote>\nI then would [[wikt:fain|fain]] convince reasonable men of the importance of some of my remarks; and prevail on them to weigh dispassionately the whole tenor of my observations.&nbsp;\u2013 I appeal to their understandings; and, as a fellow-creature, claim, in the name of my sex, some interest in their hearts. I entreat them to assist to emancipate their companion, to make her a help meet for them! Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience, they would find us more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more faithful wives, more reasonable mothers&nbsp;\u2013 in a word, better citizens.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 288.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIt is Wollstonecraft's last novel, ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman]]'' (1798), the fictionalized sequel to the ''Rights of Woman'', that is usually considered her most radical feminist work.<ref>Taylor, Chapter 9; Sapiro, 37; 149; 266.</ref>\n\n===Sensibility===\nOne of Wollstonecraft's most scathing criticisms in the ''Rights of Woman'' is against false and excessive [[sensibility]], particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are \"blown about by every momentary gust of feeling\"; because these women are \"the prey of their senses\", they cannot think rationally.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 177.</ref> In fact, not only do they do harm to themselves but they also do harm to all of civilization: these are not women who can refine civilization \u2013 these are women who will destroy it. But reason and feeling are not independent for Wollstonecraft; rather, she believes that they should inform each other. For Wollstonecraft, as for the important 18th-century philosopher [[David Hume]], the passions underpin all reason.<ref>Jones, 46.</ref> This was a theme that she would return to throughout her career, but particularly in her novels ''[[Mary: A Fiction]]'' (1788) and ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman]]''.\n\nAs part of her argument that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings, Wollstonecraft emphasises that they should not be constrained by or made slaves to their bodies or their sexual feelings.<ref>See, for example, Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 259\u201360; Taylor, 116\u201317.</ref> This particular argument has led many modern feminists to suggest that Wollstonecraft intentionally avoids granting women any sexual desire. Cora Kaplan argues that the \"negative and prescriptive assault on female sexuality\" is a \"''[[leitmotif]]''\" of the ''Rights of Woman''.<ref>Kaplan, \"Wild Nights\", 35.</ref> For example, Wollstonecraft advises her readers to \"calmly let passion subside into friendship\" in the ideal companionate marriage (that is, in the ideal of a love-based marriage that was developing at the time).<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 249.</ref> It would be better, she writes, when \"two virtuous young people marry . . . if some circumstances checked their passion\".<ref name=W192>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 192.</ref> According to Wollstonecraft, \"love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom\".<ref name=W192/> As Mary Poovey explains, \"Wollstonecraft betrays her fear that female desire might in fact court man's lascivious and degrading attentions, that the subordinate position women have been given might even be deserved. Until women can transcend their fleshly desires and fleshly forms, they will be hostage to the body.\"<ref>Poovey, 76.</ref> If women are not interested in sexuality, they cannot be dominated by men. Wollstonecraft worries that women are consumed with \"romantic wavering\", that is, they are interested only in satisfying their lusts.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 194.</ref> Because the ''Rights of Woman'' eliminates sexuality from a woman's life, Kaplan contends, it  \"expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual\" while at the same time \"exaggerat[ing] the importance of the sensual in the everyday life of women\". Wollstonecraft was so determined to wipe sexuality from her picture of the ideal woman that she ended up foregrounding it by insisting upon its absence.<ref>Kaplan, \"Wild Nights\", 41.</ref> But as Kaplan and others have remarked, Wollstonecraft may have been forced to make this sacrifice: \"it is important to remember that the notion of woman as politically enabled and independent [was] fatally linked [during the eighteenth century] to the unrestrained and vicious exercise of her sexuality.\"<ref>Kaplan, \"Wild Nights\", 33; see also Taylor, 118\u201319; Taylor, 138ff.</ref>\n\n===Republicanism===\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - La libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Men with guns being led by a half-naked woman who is holding the French flag.

Johnson (scholar)|Claudia Johnson]], a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, has called the ''Rights of Woman'' \"a republican manifesto\".<ref>Johnson, 24.</ref> Johnson contends that Wollstonecraft is hearkening back to the [[Commonwealth men|Commonwealth]] tradition of the 17th century and attempting to reestablish a [[republicanism|republican]] ethos. In Wollstonecraft's version, there would be strong, but separate, masculine and feminine roles for citizens.<ref>Johnson, 29; see also Taylor, 211\u201322; Sapiro, 82\u201383.</ref> According to Johnson, Wollstonecraft \"denounces the collapse of proper sexual distinction as the leading feature of her age, and as the grievous consequence of sentimentality itself. The problem undermining society in her view is feminized men\".<ref>Johnson, 23.</ref> If men feel free to adopt both the masculine position and the sentimental feminine position, she argues, women have no position open to them in society.<ref>Johnson, 45.</ref> Johnson therefore sees Wollstonecraft as a critic, in both the ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men|Rights of Men]]'' and the ''Rights of Woman'', of the \"masculinization of sensitivity\" in such works as [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''.<ref>Johnson, 30.</ref>\n\nIn the ''Rights of Woman'' Wollstonecraft adheres to a version of republicanism that includes a belief in the eventual overthrow of all titles, including the monarchy. She also briefly suggests that all men and women should be represented in government. But the bulk of her \"political criticism,\" as Chris Jones, a Wollstonecraft scholar, explains, \"is couched predominantly in terms of morality\".<ref name=J43>Jones, 43.</ref> Her definition of virtue focuses on the individual's happiness rather than, for example, the good of the entire society.<ref name=J43/> This is reflected in her explanation of [[natural rights]]. Because rights ultimately proceed from God, Wollstonecraft maintains that there are duties, tied to those rights, incumbent upon each and every person. For Wollstonecraft, the individual is taught republicanism and benevolence within the family; domestic relations and familial ties are crucial to her understanding of social cohesion and patriotism.<ref>Jones, 46; Taylor, 211\u201322; ''Vindications'', 101\u2013102, for example.</ref>\n\n===Class===\nIn many ways the ''Rights of Woman'' is inflected by a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] view of the world, as is its direct predecessor the ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men|Rights of Men]]''. Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle class, which she calls the \"most natural state\". She also frequently praises modesty and industry, virtues which, at the time, were associated with the middle class.<ref>Kelly, 128ff; Taylor, 167\u201368; Sapiro, 27.</ref> From her position as a middle-class writer arguing for a middle-class ethos, Wollstonecraft also attacks the wealthy, criticizing them using the same arguments she employs against women. She points out the \"false-refinement, immorality, and vanity\" of the rich, calling them \"weak, artificial beings, raised above the common wants and affections of their race, in a premature unnatural manner [who] undermine the very foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the whole mass of society\".<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 111; see also Taylor, 159\u201361; Sapiro, 91\u201392.</ref>\n\nBut Wollstonecraft's criticisms of the wealthy do not necessarily reflect a concomitant sympathy for the poor. For her, the poor are fortunate because they will never be trapped by the snares of wealth: \"Happy is it when people have the cares of life to struggle with; for these struggles prevent their becoming a prey to enervating vices, merely from idleness!\"<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 169.</ref> Moreover, she contends that charity has only negative consequences because, as Jones puts it, she \"sees it as sustaining an unequal society while giving the appearance of virtue to the rich\".<ref>Jones, 45; see also Taylor, 218\u201319; Sapiro, 91\u201392.</ref>\n\nIn her national plan for education, she retains class distinctions (with an exception for the intelligent), suggesting that: \"After the age of nine, girls and boys, intended for domestic employments, or mechanical trades, ought to be removed to other schools, and receive instruction, in some measure appropriated to the destination of each individual . . . The young people of superior abilities, or fortune, might now be taught, in another school, the dead and living languages, the elements of science, and continue the study of history and politics, on a more extensive scale, which would not exclude polite literature.\"<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 311; Kelly, 132\u201333.</ref>\n\n==Rhetoric and style==\n[[File:EmileTitle.jpeg|right|thumb|alt=Page reads \"\u00c9mile, ou de L'Education. Par J. J. Rousseau, Citoyen de Gen\u00e8ve....Tome Premier. A La Haye, Chez jean Neaulme, Libraire. M.DCC.LXII....\"|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau's]] ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762)]]\nIn attempting to navigate the cultural expectations of female writers and the generic conventions of political and philosophical discourse, Wollstonecraft, as she does throughout her ''[[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]]'', constructs a unique blend of masculine and feminine styles in the ''Rights of Woman''.<ref name=K109>Kelly, 109.</ref> She uses the language of philosophy, referring to her work as a \"treatise\" with \"arguments\" and \"principles\".<ref name=K109/> However, Wollstonecraft also uses a personal tone, employing \"I\" and \"you\", dashes and exclamation marks, and autobiographical references to create a distinctly feminine voice in the text.<ref name=K110/> The ''Rights of Woman'' further hybridizes its genre by weaving together elements of the conduct book, the short essay, and the novel, genres often associated with women, while at the same time claiming that these genres could be used to discuss philosophical topics such as rights.<ref>Kelly, 113\u201314; Taylor, 51\u201353.</ref>\n\nAlthough Wollstonecraft argues against excessive [[sensibility]], the rhetoric of the ''Rights of Woman'' is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader. Many of the most emotional comments in the book are directed at [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]. For example, after excerpting a long passage from ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762), Wollstonecraft pithily states, \"I shall make no other comments on this ingenious passage, than just to observe, that it is the philosophy of lasciviousness.\"<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 162.</ref> A mere page later, after indicting Rousseau's plan for female education, she writes \"I must relieve myself by drawing another picture.\"<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 163.</ref> These terse exclamations are meant to draw the reader to her side of the argument (it is assumed that the reader will agree with them). While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas will reach the broadest possible audience,<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 111\u201312.</ref> she actually combines the plain, rational language of the political treatise with the poetic, passionate language of sensibility to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self.<ref>Kelly, 109ff; Sapiro, 207\u2013208.</ref> Wollstonecraft defends her positions not only with reasoned argument but also with ardent rhetoric.\n\nIn her efforts to vividly describe the condition of women within society, Wollstonecraft employs several different analogies.<ref>Kelly, 118ff; Sapiro, 222.</ref> She often compares women to slaves, arguing that their ignorance and powerlessness places them in that position. But at the same time, she also compares them to \"capricious tyrants\" who use cunning and deceit to manipulate the men around them. At one point, she reasons that a woman can become either a slave or tyrant, which she describes as two sides of the same coin.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 158; Sapiro, 126.</ref> Wollstonecraft also compares women to soldiers; like military men, they are valued only for their appearance and obedience. And like the rich, women's \"softness\" has \"debased mankind\".<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 165; Taylor, 159\u201361; Sapiro, 124\u201326.</ref>\n\n==Revision==\nWollstonecraft was forced to write the ''Rights of Woman'' hurriedly to respond to [[Talleyrand]] and ongoing events. Upon completing the work, she wrote to her friend [[William Roscoe]]: \"I am dissatisfied with myself for not having done justice to the subject.&nbsp;\u2013 Do not suspect me of false modesty&nbsp;\u2013 I mean to say that had I allowed myself more time I could have written a better book, in every sense of the word&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written.\"<ref>Wollstonecraft, Mary. ''The Collected Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft''. Ed. Janet Todd. New York: Penguin Books (2003), 193\u201394.</ref> When Wollstonecraft revised the ''Rights of Woman'' for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument.<ref>Macdonald and Scherf, \"Introduction\", 23 and Mellor, 141\u201342.</ref> She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.<ref>Mellor, 141\u201342.</ref>\n\nWollstonecraft never wrote the second part to the ''Rights of Woman,'' although [[William Godwin]] published her \"Hints\", which were \"chiefly designed to have been incorporated in the second part of the ''Vindication of the Rights of Woman''\", in the posthumous collection of her works.<ref>Macdonald and Scherf, Appendix C.</ref> However, she did begin writing the novel ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman]]'', which most scholars consider a fictionalized sequel to the ''Rights of Woman''. It was unfinished at her death and also included in the ''Posthumous Works'' published by Godwin.<ref>Sapiro, 30\u201331.</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{Feminist philosophy sidebar}}\nWhen it was first published in 1792, the ''Rights of Woman'' was reviewed favourably by the ''[[Analytical Review]]'', the ''General Magazine'', the ''Literary Magazine'', ''New York Magazine'', and the ''Monthly Review'', although the assumption persists even today that ''Rights of Woman'' received hostile reviews.<ref>Janes, 293; Sapiro, 28\u201329.</ref> It was almost immediately released in a second edition in 1792, several American editions appeared, and it was translated into French. Taylor writes that \"it was an immediate success\".<ref>Taylor, 25; see also, Janes, 293\u2013302; Wardle, 157\u201358; Kelly, 135\u201336; Sapiro 28\u201329.</ref> Moreover, other writers such as [[Mary Hays]] and [[Mary Robinson (poet)|Mary Robinson]] specifically alluded to Wollstonecraft's text in their own works. Hays cited the ''Rights of Woman'' in her novel ''[[Memoirs of Emma Courtney]]'' (1796) and modelled her female characters after Wollstonecraft's ideal woman.<ref>Mellor, 143\u201344 and 146.</ref>\n\nAlthough female conservatives such as [[Hannah More]] excoriated Wollstonecraft personally, they actually shared many of the same values. As the scholar Anne Mellor has shown, both More and Wollstonecraft wanted a society founded on \"Christian virtues of rational benevolence, honesty, personal virtue, the fulfillment of social duty, thrift, sobriety, and hard work\".<ref>Mellor, 147.</ref> During the early 1790s, many writers within British society were engaged in an intense debate regarding the position of women in society. For example, the respected poet and essayist [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]] and Wollstonecraft sparred back and forth; Barbauld published several poems responding to Wollstonecraft's work and Wollstonecraft commented on them in footnotes to the ''Rights of Woman''.<ref>Mellor, 153.</ref> The work also provoked outright hostility. The [[bluestocking]] [[Elizabeth Carter]] was unimpressed with the work.<ref name=\"Gordon, 154\">Gordon, 154</ref> [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]], the [[Neoplatonist]] translator who had been a landlord to the Wollstonecraft family in the late 1770s, swiftly wrote a satire called ''A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes'': if women have rights, why not [[animal rights|animals too]]?<ref name=\"Gordon, 154\"/>\n\nAfter Wollstonecraft died in 1797, her husband [[William Godwin]] published his ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1798). He revealed much about her private life that had previously not been known to the public: her illegitimate child, her love affairs, and her attempts at suicide. While Godwin believed he was portraying his wife with love, sincerity, and compassion, contemporary readers were shocked by Wollstonecraft's unorthodox lifestyle and she became a reviled figure. [[Richard Polwhele]] targeted her in particular in his anonymous long poem ''[[The Unsex'd Females]]'' (1798), a defensive reaction to women's literary self-assertion: Hannah More is Christ to Wollstonecraft's Satan. His poem was \"well known\" among the responses ''A Vindication''.<ref>Adriana Craciun, ''Mary Wollstonecraft's a'' Vindication of the Rights of Woman'': A Sourcebook'' (Routledge, 2002, 2).</ref> One reviewer comments this \"ingenious poem\" with its \"playful sallies of sarcastic wit\" against \"our modern ladies,\"<ref>Ralph Griffiths, ''The Monthly Review'' 30 (1799): 103.</ref> though others found it \"a tedious, lifeless piece of writing.\"<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=PolUnse.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=front Introduction]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209180906/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=PolUnse.sgm&images=images%2Fmodeng&data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&tag=public&part=front |date= 9 February 2011 }}, ''The Unsex'd Females'', Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library.</ref> Critical responses largely fell along clear-cut political lines.\n\nWollstonecraft's ideas became associated with her life story and women writers felt that it was dangerous to mention her in their texts. Hays, who had previously been a close friend<ref>[[Elizabeth Robins Pennell|Pennell, Elizabeth Robins]] p351, ''Life of Mary Wollstonecraft''. (Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1884).</ref> and an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her ''Rights of Woman'', for example, did not include her in the collection of ''Illustrious and Celebrated Women'' she published in 1803.<ref>Mellor, 145; Taylor, 27\u201328.</ref> [[Maria Edgeworth]] specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in her novel ''[[Belinda (Edgeworth novel)|Belinda]]'' (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist in the character of Harriet Freke.<ref>Mellor, 155; Taylor, 30\u201331.</ref> But, like [[Jane Austen]], she does not reject Wollstonecraft's ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial to the development of the nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.<ref>Mellor, 156.</ref>\n\nThe negative views towards Wollstonecraft persisted for over a century. The ''Rights of Woman'' was not reprinted until the middle of the 19th century and it still retained an aura of ill-repute. [[George Eliot]] wrote \"there is in some quarters a vague prejudice against the ''Rights of Woman'' as in some way or other a reprehensible book, but readers who go to it with this impression will be surprised to find it eminently serious, severely moral, and withal rather heavy\".<ref>Quoted in Sapiro, 30.</ref>\nThe [[suffragist]] (i.e. moderate reformer, as opposed to [[suffragette]]) [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett]] wrote the introduction to the centenary edition of the ''Rights of Woman'', cleansing the memory of Wollstonecraft and claiming her as the foremother of the struggle for the vote.<ref>Gordon, 521</ref> While the ''Rights of Woman'' may have paved the way for feminist arguments, 20th century feminists have tended to use Wollstonecraft's life story, rather than her texts, for inspiration;<ref>Kaplan,\"Mary Wollstonecraft's reception and legacies\".</ref> her unorthodox lifestyle convinced them to try new \"experiments in living\", as [[Virginia Woolf]] termed it in her famous essay on Wollstonecraft.<ref>Woolf, Virginia. \"[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91c2/chapter13.html The Four Figures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403154849/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91c2/chapter13.html |date=3 April 2007 }}\".

A name for a desert coursing Afghan hound, Tazi (sag-e-tazi), suggests a shared ancestry with the very similar Tasy breed from the [[Caspian Sea]] area of [[Russia]] and [[Turkmenistan]]. Other types or breeds of similar appearance are the Taigan from the mountainous [[Tian Shan]] region on the Chinese border of Afghanistan, and the [[Barakzay]], or [[Kurram Valley]] Hound.\n\nThere are at least 13 types known in Afghanistan,<ref name=\"historie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nika-afghani.unas.cz/historie.htm |title=Historie afg\u00e1nsk\u00e9ho chrta |language=Czech |trans-title=History of the Afghan Hound |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref> and some are being developed (through breeding and record keeping) into modern purebred breeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/~w-40770/star/rare/rare2.html |title=List of Rare Sighthounds |date=May 18, 2000 |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref> As the lives of the peoples with whom these dogs developed change in the modern world, often these [[landrace]] types of dogs lose their use and disappear; there may have been many more types of longhaired sighthound in the past.\n\nOnce out of [[Afghanistan]], the history of the Afghan Hound breed becomes an important part of the history of the very earliest dog shows and [[The Kennel Club]] (UK). Various sighthounds were brought to England in the 1800s by army officers returning from [[British India]] (which at the time included), Afghanistan, and [[Persia]], and were exhibited at dog shows, which were then just becoming popular, under various names, such as Barukzy hounds.<ref name=\"historie\" /> They were also called \"Persian Greyhounds\" by the English, in reference to their own indigenous sighthound.\n\nOne dog in particular, ''Zardin'', was brought in 1907 from India by Captain Bariff,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afghanhoundtimes.com/zardinb.htm|title=Afghan Hound Times - Afghan Hound Art and Antics|website=www.afghanhoundtimes.com}}</ref> and became the early ideal of [[breed type]] for what was still called the Persian Greyhound. Zardin was the basis of the writing of the first breed standard in 1912, but breeding of the dogs was stopped by World War I.<ref name=\"historie\" />\n\nOut of the longhaired sighthound types known in Afghanistan, two main strains make up the modern Afghan Hound breed. The first were a group of hounds brought to [[Scotland]] from [[Balochistan (Afghanistan)|Baluchistan]] by Major and Mrs. G. Bell-Murray and Miss Jean C. Manson in 1920, and are called the ''Bell-Murray strain''.\n\nThese dogs were of the lowland or steppe type, also called kalagh, and are less heavily coated. The second strain was a group of dogs from a kennel in [[Kabul]] owned by Mrs. Mary Amps, which she shipped to England in 1925. She and her husband came to Kabul after the Afghan war in 1919, and the foundation sire of her kennel (named Ghazni) in Kabul was a dog that closely resembled Zardin. Her ''Ghazni strain'' were the more heavily coated mountain type. Most of the Afghans in the United States were developed from the Ghazni strain from England. The first Afghans in Australia were imported from the United States in 1934, also of the Ghazni strain.<ref name=\"Haymann\">{{Cite magazine|author=Haymann, Franck |date=5 May 2006 |title=Afghan Hound, From The Streets Of Kabul To The Main Rings Of The World |magazine=Chien |url=http://www.aniwa.com/en/chien/document/en/chien/magazine/discover/dog-breeds/afghan-hound--from-the-streets-of-kabul-to-the-main-rings-of-the-world/index.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830030454/http://www.aniwa.com/en/chien/document/en/chien/magazine/discover/dog-breeds/afghan-hound--from-the-streets-of-kabul-to-the-main-rings-of-the-world/index.htm |archivedate=30 August 2008 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> The French breed club was formed in 1939 (FALAPA). The mountain and steppe strains became mixed into the modern Afghan Hound breed, and a new standard was written in 1948, which is still used today.\n\nThe afghan hound can also come with a much more \"patterned\" coat. This descends from the Bell-Murray's and the Ghazni lines, and is displayed in much lighter feathering of coat, deeper saddle (often actually looking like a saddle) and much shorter hair on the face and neck. It is believed that these particular afghan hounds were a product of much hotter parts of the country.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Afghan hound : a definitive study|last=Margaret.|first=Niblock,|date=1980|publisher=Arco Pub|isbn=0668049340}}</ref>\n\nThe spectacular beauty of Afghan Hound dogs caused them to become highly desirable showdogs and pets, and they are recognised by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. One of the Amps Ghazni, ''Sirdar'', won BIS at [[Crufts]] in 1928 and 1930. An Afghan hound was featured on the cover of [[Life Magazine]], November 26, 1945. \"Afghan Hounds were the most popular in Australia in the 1970s\u2026and won most of the major shows\".<ref name=\"Haymann\" /> An Afghan Hound won BIS (Best in Show) at the 1996 [[World Dog Show]] in Budapest.

The coat may be any colour, but white markings, particularly on the head, are discouraged; many individuals have a [[melanistic mask|black facial mask]]. A specimen may have facial hair that looks like a [[Fu Manchu mustache]]. The mustache is called \"mandarins.\" Some Afghan Hounds are almost white, but parti-color hounds (white with islands of red or black) are penalized in the AKC standard, but not by the FCI. The long, fine-textured coat requires considerable care and grooming. The long topknot and the shorter-haired saddle on the back of the dog are distinctive features of the Afghan Hound coat. The high hipbones and unique small ring on the end of the tail are also characteristics of the breed.\n\nThe temperament of the typical Afghan Hound can be aloof and dignified, but happy and clownish when it's playing. This breed, as is the case with many sighthounds, has a high prey drive and may not get along with small animals. The Afghan Hound can be a successful competitor in dog agility trials as well as an intuitive therapy dog and companion.  Genomic studies have pointed to the Afghan Hound as one of the oldest of dog breeds.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Savolainen P.

In [[Pashto language|Pashto]] the word \"bakhmull\" means \"velvet\" due to  its incredible silky velvet, long, ivory color hair of the coat, rather abundant and long on the whole body, because it is a mountain oriental sighthound, except the \"saddle\", front parts of four  legs and the muzzle. Its color is always fawn, ivory or white with a darker \"saddle\",  thus it produces an impression of a fawn (yellowish) dog which coat color is protective khaki that matches sandstone  and limestone of the Hindu Kush mountain landscape and deserts. Following colors are not permissible: red, red with white spots, black and black with white spots. Since the 1980s the centre of Bakhmull breeding is in Russia, \"The Blue Dale el Bark Bakhmull\"  Moscow, where they are spread all over  the former [[Soviet Republics]] and various regions. Natalia Gherasiova  established \"The Blue Dale el Bark\" and later \"The National club Bakhmull\" attached to RFOS (Russian Federation for [[Hunting]] Dogs) and RKF. The foundation stock was brought to Russia in the 70s by military men from Afghanistan. Breed Standard for tazi BAKHMULL (aboriginal Afghan Hound)  was adopted in Moscow, Russia (since Russia has become the 2nd motherland of bakhmulls) first in 1985 and later after detailed elaboration  in 1997 (RFOS-RKF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bakhmull.com/stande.htm|title=\u0411\u0430\u043a\u0445\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c - \u0410\u0444\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0410\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0437\u0430\u044f|website=www.bakhmull.com}}</ref>\n\nBakhmull  is graceful and powerful, well balanced in conformation and in mind, of perfect symmetry, beautiful and noble, aggressive  to beasts and generous to people, intelligent and affectionate, joyous, calm at home and alert and reckless in field, devoted to people and with good guard qualities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZylC11lBfE |title=Bakhmull - Video Learning - WizScience.com |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-08-13 |accessdate=2017-09-18}}</ref>  Though its coat is long, it does not require much grooming.

Bakhmull's gait is easy and springy. Searching for a prey bakhmull walks or jog-trots. After seeing  the beast it immediately starts galloping very fast  with a whole body, covering long distances, overcoming obstacles on the way, showing great jumping power, speed and manoeuvring, making steeple chase,  changing the direction all of a sudden with a great skill.

In this respect it is similar in type to the [[Saluki]].\n\n===Colours===\n[[File:Fahim Kel Az'Amour.JPG|thumb|]] \nColours permitted by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI)]] breed standard are clear sand to dark fawn/brown, red and [[brindle]] (with or without a [[melanistic mask|dark mask]]), with white bib, tail tip, and white on all feet (which can be tips of toes to high stockings). Since 2015 white stockings that go above the elbow joint are considered disqualifying features in the [[Federation Cynologique Internationale|FCI]] member countries, as is a white collar or half collar (Irish marked).\n\nSome conservationists support the idea that in Africa, Azawakhs are still found in a variety of colours such as red, blue fawn (that is, with a lilac cast), grizzle, and, rarely, blue and black with various white markings including Irish marked (white collar) and particolour (mostly white).<ref>[http://www.tombouktous-azawakhs.de/epa.html Tombouktous-azawakhs.de] {{de icon}}</ref> Because of this wide color variation in the native population, the American standard used by the [[American Kennel Club|AKC]] and [[United Kennel Club|UKC]] allows any color combination found in Africa. (AKC and UKC are not a member of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale|FCI]])\n\n===Movement===\nThe Azawakh's light, supple, lissome gait is a notable breed characteristic, as is an upright [[double suspension gallop]].\n[[File:Gao nou2.jpg|thumb|Azawakh in movement]]\n\n==Health==\n[[File:Chart afryka\u0144ski azawakh 31.jpg|thumb|Azawakh]]\n[[File:Chart afryka\u0144ski Azawakh II 654.jpg|thumb|Azawakh]]\nAzawakhs are an incredibly sound [[coursing]] hound. Serious  injuries are rare. The dogs heal very quickly from injury.\n\nAzawakh have no known incidence of hip dysplasia. There is a small occurrence of adult-onset idiopathic [[epilepsy]] in the breed. [[Wobbler disease]], or cervical vertebral instability, does rarely occur. Some breeders believe this is largely a developmental problem where puppies grow too quickly due to a high-protein Western diet.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Reproduction==\nLike the Basenji and Tibetan Mastiff, the Azawakh often has a single annual estrus. Unassisted birth of healthy puppies is normal. Litter sizes are usually from four to six puppies, but litters as small as one and as large as ten occur.\n\n==Care==\nAzawakh need a fairly high level of exercise and should have regular runs off lead in large enclosed areas to run off steam. The dogs are very social and emotional. They need a master that provides firm but fair leadership. Azawakh thrive on companionship of other Azawakh.\n\n==Temperament==\nUnlike other sighthounds, the primary function of the Azawakh in its native land is that of protector. It develops an intense bond with its owner, yet can perform independently from its master. With those they accept, Azawakh are gentle and extremely affectionate. With strangers many are reserved and prefer not to be touched, but are not inherently aggressive. Although raised to protect livestock, they do not have innate aggression toward canines or humans unless they are threatened.\n\nAzawakh have high energy and tremendous endurance. They are excellent training companions for runners and are nearly impervious to heat. They will happily run in weather over 100 degrees Fahrenheit that would kill a [[Greyhound]].\n\nMany Azawakh dislike rain and cold weather.\n\nAzawakh are pack oriented and form complex social hierarchies. They have tremendous memories and are able to recognize each other after long periods of separation. They can often be found sleeping on top of each other for warmth and companionship.<ref>[http://www.tombouktous-azawakhs.de/ece.html Tombouktous-azawakhs.de] {{de icon}}</ref>\n\nAlberto Rossi: \"To raise an Azawakh is like building a very fragile construction, which takes a lot of sensibility and can be destroyed from one minute to the next. But every minute it lasts, it fills you with great happiness.\" Every time I\u00b4m sitting in a chair or sofa at least one of my dogs tries to take a seat on my lap. The same happens to those of my guests which they love. In these moments they seem to be the image of calmness, gentleness, and trust. But one should not be deceived about this. In the deepest place of their soul resides something wild and native, and they will remind us about it with the first occasion and we should not forget, even for a moment, not to treat them like a normal dog.\"\n\n==History==\n\nBred by the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Fula people|Fula]] and various other nomads of the [[Sahara]] and sub-Saharan Sahel in the countries of [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Burkina Faso]], and southern [[Algeria]], the breed known by the tuaregs as \u201dOska\u201d was used there as a [[guard dog]] and to hunt [[gazelle]] and [[hare]] at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. The austerity of the [[Sahel]] environment has ensured that only the most fit dogs survive and has accentuated the breed's ruggedness and independence. Unlike some other sighthounds, the Azawakh is more of a pack hunter and they bump down the quarry with hindquarters when it has been tired out. In role of a guard dog, if an Azawakh senses danger it will bark to alert the other members of the pack, and they will gather together as a pack under the lead of the alpha dog, then chase off or attack the predator. The [[Sloughi]], by comparison, is more of an independent lone hunter and has a high hunting instinct.\n\nThey are relatively uncommon in Europe and North America but there is a growing band of devotees. Azawakhs have a range of temperaments from lap dog to quite fierce. Lifelong socialization and firm but gentle handling are critical. Well socialised and trained, they can be good with other dogs, cats, children, and strangers. Azawakh may be registered with the FCI in the USA via the Federaci\u00f3n Can\u00f3fila de Puerto Rico (FCPR).<ref>[http://www.fcpr2000.org/index-en.html Federaci\u00f3n Can\u00f3fila de Puerto Rico] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921193401/http://www.fcpr2000.org/index-en.html |date=September 21, 2008 }} {{es icon}}</ref> European FCI clubs and the AKC recognize the FCPR as an acceptable registry.

It originated from the [[pariah dogs]] of sub-Saharan Africa&mdash;also called ''bush dogs'' or ''basenji''\u2014and is also closely related to the [[Sloughi]] of the [[Maghreb]]. Despite morphological similarities, mitochondrial DNA evidence shows that it is only very distantly related to other sight hounds. Azawakh have a rare [[glucose isomerase]] allele (GPI<sup>B</sup>) that occurs only in [[fox]]es, [[jackals]], [[Eurasian wolf#Italian wolf|Italian wolves]], Sloughi dogs and a handful of other quite unrelated rare dogs found mostly in Japan. The presence of the GPI<sup>B</sup> suggests an ancient differentiation of the Azawakh from other dog populations near the base of the dog family tree divergence from wolves or perhaps a uniquely African cross-breeding with local African canids such as jackals. [[Petroglyph]] rock art dating from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago during the [[Green Sahara]] (also known as the Holocene and Neolithic Subpluvial) shows cursorial dogs in conjunction with hunters. Archaeologists have found dog bones buried in Holocene settlements in the Sahara. At the close of the Holocene Wet Phase in the 4th millennium BCE, the Sahara returned to desert and created a formidable physical barrier to travel. Together, this evidence suggests that the Azawakh population has a unique genetic heritage that has been largely isolated from other dog populations for millennia.\n\nIn the [[common era]] the Sahel dogs are almost totally isolated from northern dogs by the Sahara, but the ties to the pariah dogs to the south are extremely close. Azawakh are virtually indistinguishable from the Sahel pariah dog population from which they are drawn. In addition to a basic physical structure, the Azawakh share a number of unique traits with the pariah dogs:\n\n* intense suspicion of the unknown\n* strong guarding instinct\n* pack hunting behavior\n* complex social hierarchies\n* unique vocalizations\n* extra pre-molar teeth\n* strong instinct to dig up big dens\n\n\nThroughout the Sahel, very elegant puppies can be found among rustic siblings. The Sahel nomads do not have the same breed concepts as in the West and, unlike the [[Bedouin]] of the North, do not recognize a strict separation of ''al hor'' (noble) from ''kelb'' (mongrel) dogs. The nomads act as an extra level of selection on top of the intense natural selection pressure of the Sahel environment. The approach to selection is diametrically opposed to Western breeding, and presents the advantage of maintaining a large reservoir of genetic variability and resilience.\n\nThe peoples of the Sahel control dam lines and cull puppies heavily at birth according to locally held aesthetic criteria that are not yet fully understood. In the Sahel, color is not a selection criterion. The alpha male dog from the local population is usually the sire. Females are usually culled unless the family projects a need for more dogs in the future.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[http://www.tombouktous-azawakhs.de/epa.html   ''Colour, Pattern and Marking Varieties of the Azawakh in the Regions of Origin''], 2005, Dr. Gabriel Meissen.\n*''Dogs of Africa'', 2003, by Sian Hall, Alpine Blue Ribbon Books.\n*''Dog's Best Friend'', 1999, by Ursula Birr, Gerald Krakauer and Daniela Osiander, Park Street Press.\n*[http://saluqi.home.netcom.com/belkin.htm  ''The Functional Saluki''], 1993, Dan Belkin, Ph.D., Transcribed from a seminar given at the Saluki Club of America National Specialty.\n*''The Genetics of the Dog'', 2001, Anatoly Ruvinsky and J.

Acrylic paints are [[water-soluble]], but become [[water-resistant]] when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted with water, or modified with acrylic gels, mediums, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a [[watercolor painting|watercolor]], a [[gouache]] or an [[oil painting]], or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media.<ref name=\"Art Materials\">{{cite web|url=http://www.daler-rowney.com/ |title=Art Materials |publisher=Daler Rowney |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-05}}</ref> Acrylic paint is typically used for crafting, or in art classes in schools because it does not require any chemicals, and rinses away with just water. It also is less likely to leave a stain on clothes than oil paint.\n\n== History ==\n\nAs early as 1934, the first usable acrylic resin dispersion was developed by German chemical company [[BASF]], which was patented by [[Rohm and Haas]]. The synthetic paint was first used in the 1940s, combining some of the properties of oil and watercolor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Phaidon Press |title=The 20th-Century art book |year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London |isbn=0714835420 |edition=Reprinted.}}</ref>  Between 1946 and 1949, [[Leonard Bocour]] and [[Sam Golden]] invented a solution acrylic paint under the brand [[Magna paint]]. These were [[mineral spirits|mineral spirit]]-based paints.<ref>Terry Fenton  [http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials online essay] about [[Kenneth Noland]], and acrylic paint, accessed April 30, 2007</ref> Acrylics were made commercially available in the 1950s.\n\nFollowing that development, Golden came up with a waterborne acrylic paint called \"Aquatec\".<ref>{{cite web|title = A History of GOLDEN Artist Colors, Inc.|publisher = Golden Artist Colors, Inc.|url = http://www.goldenpaints.com/history}}</ref> [[Otto R\u00f6hm]] invented [[acrylic resin]], which was quickly transformed into acrylic paint. In 1953, the year that Rohm and Haas developed the first acrylic emulsions, Jose L. Gutierrez produced ''Politec Acrylic Artists' Colors'' in Mexico, and Henry Levinson of Cincinnati-based Permanent Pigments Co. produced [[Liquitex]] colors. These two product lines were the very first acrylic emulsion artists' paints.<ref>Painting With Acrylics (Watson-Guptill publications)</ref>\n\nWater-based acrylic paints were subsequently sold as [[latex]] house paints, as latex is the technical term for a suspension of polymer microparticles in water. Interior latex house paints tend to be a combination of [[Binder (material)|binder]] (sometimes acrylic, [[Vinyl group|vinyl]], [[Polyvinyl acetate|pva]], and others), [[filler (materials)|filler]], [[pigment]], and [[water]]. Exterior latex house paints may also be a [[co-polymer]] blend, but the best exterior water-based paints are 100% acrylic, due to elasticity and other factors.  Vinyl, however, costs half of what 100% acrylic resins cost, and PVA (polyvinyl acetate) is even cheaper, so paint companies make many different combinations of them to match the market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dundean.com/tips_what_is_latex_paint.shtml |title=Water-based Alchemy by Dean Sickler |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSoon after the water-based acrylic binders were introduced as house paints, artists and companies alike began to explore the potential of the new binders. Water-soluble artists' acrylic paints were sold commercially by [[Liquitex]] beginning in the 1950s, with modern high-viscosity paints becoming available in the early '60s. In 1963, [[George Rowney|Rowney]] (part of [[Daler-Rowney]] since 1983) was the first manufacturer to introduce artist's acrylic paints in Europe, under the brand name \"Cryla\".<ref name=\"Art Materials\" />\n\n== Painting with acrylics ==\nBefore the 19th century, artists mixed their own paints, which allowed them to achieve the desired color and thickness, and to control the use of fillers, if any. While suitable media and raw pigments are available for the individual production of acrylic paint, hand mixing may not be practical because of the fast drying time and other technical issues.\n\nAcrylic painters can modify the appearance, hardness, flexibility, texture, and other characteristics of the paint surface by using acrylic mediums or simply by adding water. Watercolor and oil painters also use various mediums, but the range of acrylic mediums is much greater. Acrylics have the ability to bond to many different surfaces, and mediums can be used to modify their binding characteristics. Acrylics can be used on paper, canvas and a range of other materials, however their use on engineered woods such as [[medium-density fibreboard|medium-density fiberboard]] can be problematic because of the porous nature of those surfaces.<ref>Sealing, Staining, and Filling [http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/HI_27.pdf] Wood Finishing and Refinishing accessed December 08, 2010</ref> In these cases it is recommended that the surface first be sealed with an appropriate sealer. Acrylics can be applied in thin layers or washes to create effects that resemble watercolors and other water-based mediums. They can also be used to build thick layers of paint\u2014gel and molding paste are sometimes used to create paintings with relief features. Acrylic paints are also used in hobbies such as train, car, house, and human models. People who make such models use acrylic paint to build facial features on dolls, or raised details on other types of models. Wet acrylic paint is easily removed from paint brushes and skin with water, whereas oil paints require the use of a hydrocarbon.\n\nAcrylic paints are the most common paints used in [[surrealist techniques#Grattage|grattage]], a surrealist technique that became popular with the advent of acrylic paint. Acrylics are used for this purpose because they easily scrape or peel from a surface.<ref>Grattage [http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Grattage] Art Techniques accessed December 08, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Painting techniques ===\n\n{{Main|Acrylic painting techniques }}\n\nAcrylic artists' paints may be thinned with water and used as [[Wash (visual arts)|washes]] in the manner of watercolor paints, but unlike watercolor the washes are not rehydratable once dry. For this reason, acrylics do not lend themselves to the color lifting techniques of [[gum arabic]]-based watercolor paints.\n\n[[File:Www Beo cc.jpg|thumb|Fluorescent acrylic paints lit by UV light. Paintings by Beo Beyond.|alt=A person in silhouette stands gazing down at a piece of art on the floor. Paintings on the wall behind the person are glowing from the UV light.]]\n\nAcrylic paints with [[Gloss (paint)|gloss or matte]] finishes are common, although a satin (semi-matte) sheen is most common. Some brands exhibit a range of finishes (e.g. heavy-body paints from [[Golden Artist Colors|Golden]], [[Liquitex]], [[Winsor & Newton]] and [[Daler-Rowney]]); Politec acrylics are fully matte.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.valgreen.com/acrilyic-painting/|title=Val Green's Art Space  \u2013 Acrylic Painting|website=www.valgreen.com|access-date=2016-03-31}}</ref> As with oils, pigment amounts and particle size or shape can affect the paint sheen. Matting agents can also be added during manufacture to dull the finish. If desired, the artist can mix different media with their paints and use topcoats or varnishes to alter or unify sheen.\n\nWhen dry, acrylic paint is generally non-removable from a solid surface if it adheres to the surface. Water or mild solvents do not re-solubilize it, although [[isopropyl alcohol]] can lift some fresh paint films off. [[Toluene]] and [[acetone]] can remove paint films, but they do not lift paint stains very well and are not selective. The use of a solvent to remove paint may result in removal of all of the paint layers (acrylic [[gesso]], et cetera). Oils and warm, soapy water can remove acrylic paint from skin.<ref>Removing Acrylic Paint From Skin [http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf419156.tip.html] Instructions accessed December 08, 2010</ref>\n\nAn acrylic sizing should be used to prime canvas in preparation for painting with acrylic paints, to prevent Support Induced Discoloration (SID). Acrylic paint contains surfactants that can pull up discoloration from a raw canvas, especially in transparent glazed or translucent gelled areas.  Gesso alone will not stop SID; a sizing must be applied before using a gesso.<ref>Preparing A Painting Support [https://www.goldenpaints.com/technicalinfo_prepsupp] accessed December 17, 2017</ref><ref>OPEN Acrylics, Shellac, and SID [http://www.justpaint.org/open-acrylics-shellac-and-sid/] accessed December 17, 2017</ref>\n\nThe viscosity of acrylic can be successfully reduced by using suitable extenders that maintain the integrity of the paint film. There are [[Acrylic retarder|retarders]] to slow drying and extend ''workability'' time, and ''flow releases'' to increase color-blending ability.\n\n== Properties==\n\n===Grades===\n\nCommercial acrylic paints come in two grades:\n* '''Artist acrylics''' ('''professional acrylics''') are created and designed to resist chemical reactions from exposure to water, ultraviolet light, and oxygen.<ref name=\"Patti Brady\">{{cite book|last1=Brady|first1=Patti|title=rethinking acrylic|date=December 29, 2008|publisher=North Light Books|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|isbn=1600610137|page=16}}</ref> Professional-grade acrylics have the most pigment, which allows for more medium manipulation and limits the color shift when mixed with other colors or after drying.<ref name=\"Will Kemp\">{{cite web|last1=Kemp|first1=Will|title=The 8 key differences between Artist quality vs Student grade acrylic paints|url=http://willkempartschool.com/what-is-the-difference-between-artist-quality-vs-student-grade-acrylic-paints/|website=willkempartschool.com/|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"AGColors\">{{cite book|last1=Glover|first1=David Lloyd|title=Color Mixing in Acrylic|date=2014|publisher=Walter Foster Publishing|isbn=9781600583889|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwX2AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA9&dq=acrylic+paint+grades&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBWoVChMIh6uB7b-VyQIVg7geCh3KJwhV#v=onepage&q=acrylic%20paint%20grades&f=false|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref>\n* '''Student acrylics''' have working characteristics similar to artist acrylics, but with lower pigment concentrations, less-expensive formulas, and fewer available colors. More expensive pigments are generally replicated by hues. Colors are designed to be mixed even though color strength is lower. Hues may not have exactly the same mixing characteristics as full-strength colors.<ref name=\"Will Kemp\"/><ref name=\"AGColors\" />\n\n=== Varieties ===\n*'''Heavy body acrylics''' are typically found in the Artist and Student Grade paints. \"Heavy Body\" refers to the viscosity or thickness of the paint. They are the best choice for impasto or heavier paint applications and will hold a brush or knife stroke and even a medium stiff peak. Gel Mediums (\"pigment-less paints\") are also available in various viscosities and used to thicken or thin paints, as well as extend paints and add transparency.<ref name=\"Liquitex\">{{cite web|title=Heavy Body Acrylic Paint|url=http://www.liquitex.com/PB2ColMenu.aspx?pageid=297&id=290|website=liquitex.com/|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref>\n**Examples of Heavy Body Acrylics are Matisse Structure Acrylic Colors, Lukas Pastos Acrylics, [[Liquitex|Liquitex Heavy Body Acrylics]] and [[Golden Artist Colors|Golden Heavy Body Acrylics]].  \n*'''Medium viscosity acrylics''' \u2013 Fluid acrylics, Soft body acrylics, or High Flow acrylics \u2013 have a lower viscosity but generally the same pigmentation as the Heavy Body acrylics. Available in either Artist quality or Craft quality, the cost and quality vary accordingly. These paints are good for watercolor techniques, airbrush application, or when smooth coverage is desired. Fluid acrylics can be mixed with any medium to thicken them for impasto work, or to thin them for glazing applications.<ref name=\"Golden\">{{cite web|title=Fluid|url=http://www.goldenpaints.com/products/colors/fluid|website=goldenpaints.com/|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref>\n**Examples of fluid acrylics include Lukascryl Liquid, Lukascryl Studio, [[Liquitex|Liquitex Soft Body]] and [[Golden Artist Colors|Golden Fluid acrylics]]. \n*'''Open acrylics''' were created to address the one major difference between oil and acrylic paints: the shortened time it takes acrylic paints to dry. Designed by Golden Artist Colors, Inc. with a hydrophilic acrylic resin, these paints can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, or even weeks, to dry completely, depending on paint thickness, support characteristics, temperature, and humidity.<ref name=\"Patti\">{{cite book|last1=Brady|first1=Patti|title=rethinking acrylic|date=2008|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=1600610137|page=14}}</ref> \n*'''Iridescent, pearl''' and '''interference acrylic colors''' combine conventional pigments with powdered mica ([[aluminium silicate]]) or powdered bronze to achieve complex visual effects. Colors have shimmering or reflective characteristics, depending on the coarseness or fineness of the powder. Iridescent colors are used in fine arts and crafts. \n*'''Acrylic gouache''' is like traditional [[gouache]] because it dries to a matte, opaque finish. However, unlike traditional gouache, the acrylic binder makes it water-resistant once it dries. Like craft paint, it will adhere to a variety of surfaces, not only canvas and paper. This paint is typically used by water-colorists, cartoonists, or illustrators, and for decorative or [[folk art]] applications.\n**Examples of acrylic gouache are Lascaux Gouache and Turner Acryl Gouache. \n*'''Craft acrylics''' can be used on surfaces besides canvas, such as wood, metal, fabrics, and ceramics. They are used in decorative painting techniques and [[Faux painting|faux finishes]] to decorate objects of ordinary life. Although colors can be mixed, pigments are often not specified. Each color line is formulated instead to achieve a wide range of premixed colors. Craft paints usually employ vinyl or PVA resins to increase adhesion and lower cost. \n*'''Interactive acrylics''' are all-purpose acrylic artists' colors which have the characteristic fast-drying nature of artists' acrylics, but are formulated to allow artists to delay drying when they need more working time, or re-wet their work when they want to do more wet blending.\n*'''Exterior acrylics''' are paints that can withstand outdoor conditions. Like craft acrylics, they adhere to many surfaces. They are more resistant to both water and ultraviolet light. This makes them the acrylic of choice for architectural murals, outdoor signs, and many [[Faux finish|faux-finishing techniques]].\n\n=== Differences between acrylic and oil paint ===\n[[File:Small Detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of acrylic painting showing finishes that resemble both oil and watercolor|alt=Opaque red/orange square in the upper-right corner looks opaque like oil paint. The textured grey/black area looks like watercolor.]]\nThe vehicle and binder of [[oil paint]]s is [[linseed oil]] (or another [[drying oil]]), whereas acrylic paint has water as the vehicle for an [[emulsion]] (suspension) of acrylic polymer, which serves as the binder. Thus, oil paint is said to be \"oil-based\", whereas acrylic paint is \"water-based\" (or sometimes \"water-borne\").\n[[File:Acryl Stilleven met blauwe kan Julien Grandgagnage.jpg|left|thumb|Example of blending technique with acrylics. Painting on wooden panel by Julien Grandgagnage (1993). 30\u00d724. Click to enlarge.]]\n[[File:Acrylic Blending.jpg|thumb|A demonstration of blending with acrylic paint. No retarders were used.|alt=An acrylic painting of a red and blue face in profile lies on top of a tray on a table. Below the painting, on the table, are a palette and various sizes and colors of paint.]]\n\nThe main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time. Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over [[underpainting]]s. This slow-drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain techniques, but it impedes an artist trying to work quickly. The fast evaporation of water from regular acrylic paint films can be slowed with the use of [[acrylic retarder]]s. Retarders are generally glycol or glycerin-based additives. The addition of a retarder slows the evaporation rate of the water.\n\nOil paints may require the use of solvents such as mineral spirits or [[turpentine]] to thin the paint and clean up. These solvents generally have some level of toxicity and are often found objectionable. Relatively recently, water-miscible oil paints have been developed for artists' use. Oil paint films can become increasingly yellow and brittle with time; they lose much of their flexibility in a few decades. Additionally, the rules of \"[[fat over lean]]\" must be employed to ensure the paint films are durable.\n\nOil paint has a higher pigment load than acrylic paint. As linseed oil contains a smaller molecule than acrylic paint, oil paint is able to absorb substantially more pigment. Oil provides a refractive index that is less clear than acrylic dispersions, which imparts a unique \"look and feel\" to the resultant paint film. Not all the pigments of oil paints are available in acrylics and vice versa, as each medium has different chemical sensitivities. Some historical pigments are alkali sensitive, and therefore cannot be made in an acrylic emulsion; others are just too difficult to formulate.<ref>[http://www.justpaint.org/some-historical-pigments-and-their-replacements/ Some Historical Pigments and Their Replacements] accessed December 18, 2017</ref> Approximate \"hue\" color formulations, that do not contain the historical pigments, are typically offered as substitutes.<ref>[http://www.goldenpaints.com/products/colors/fluid/prussian-blue-hue Prussian Blue Hue (Fluid)] accessed December 18, 2017</ref><ref>[https://www.goldenpaints.com/products/colors/heavy-body/viridian-green-hue Viridian Green Hue (Heavy Body)] accessed December 18, 2017</ref>\n\nDue to acrylic paint's more flexible nature and more consistent drying time between layers, an artist does not have to follow the same rules of oil painting, where more medium must be applied to each layer to avoid cracking. It usually takes 15\u201320 minutes for one to two layers of acrylic paint to dry. Although canvas needs to be properly primed before painting with oil to prevent it from eventually rotting the canvas, acrylic can be safely applied straight to the canvas. The rapid drying of acrylic paint tends to discourage blending of color and use of [[wet-in-wet]] technique as in oil painting. Even though acrylic retarders can slow drying time to several hours, it remains a relatively fast-drying medium and adding too much acrylic retarder can prevent the paint from ever drying properly.\n\nMeanwhile, acrylic paint is very elastic, which prevents cracking from occurring. Acrylic paint's binder is acrylic polymer emulsion \u2013 as this binder dries, the paint remains flexible.<ref>Acrylic Paint Common Questions [http://www.liquitex.com/techniques/liquitexqa.cfm] Technical Summary of Acrylic Paint accessed December 06, 2010 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101090912/http://www.liquitex.com/techniques/liquitexqa.cfm|date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAnother difference between oil and acrylic paints is the versatility offered by acrylic paints. Acrylics are very useful in mixed media, allowing the use of pastel (oil and chalk), charcoal and pen (among others) on top of the dried acrylic painted surface. Mixing other bodies into the acrylic is possible\u2014sand, rice, and even pasta may be incorporated in the artwork. Mixing artist or student grade acrylic paint with household acrylic emulsions is possible, allowing the use of premixed tints straight from the tube or tin, and thereby presenting the painter with a vast color range at their disposal. This versatility is also illustrated by the variety of additional artistic uses for acrylics. Specialized acrylics have been manufactured and used for [[Linoblock|linoblock printing]] (acrylic [[block printing]] ink has been produced by Derivan since the early 1980s), [[Face Painting|face painting]], [[airbrushing]], [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]]-like techniques,  and [[Screen printing|fabric screen printing]].\n\nAnother difference between oil and acrylic paint is the cleanup. Acrylic paint can be cleaned out of a brush with any soap, while oil paint needs a specific type to be sure to get all the oil out of the brushes. Also, it is easier to let a palette with oil paint dry and then scrape the paint off, whereas one can easily clean wet acrylic paint with water.<ref name=\"Blake1997\">{{cite book|author=Wendon Blake|title=Acrylic Painting: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ow2p4mhXyZQC&pg=PA59|year=1997|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-29589-3|pages=59\u2013}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal-inline|Visual arts}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat}}\n* [http://www.napauk.com/ National Acrylic Painter's Association]\n* [http://inthelightart.com/fine-art/ Handling and Care Tips for paintings]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Acrylic Paint}}\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Art materials]]\n[[Category:Painting materials]]\n[[Category:Paints]]\n[[Category:Watermedia]]", "sha1": "cnb3gf6ojpp4yelsjd355w9mpekx0iq"}}, {"title": "Angular momentum", "ns": "0", "id": "2839", "revision": {"id": "865714605", "parentid": "864872977", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T17:46:39Z", "contributor": {"username": "JCW-CleanerBot", "id": "31737083"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Conservation of angular momentum */[[User:JCW-CleanerBot#Logic|task]], replaced: Philosophical Transactions Royal Society \u2192 Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox physical quantity\n| name = Angular momentum\n| image = Gyroskop.jpg\n| caption = This [[gyroscope]] remains upright while spinning due to the conservation of its angular momentum.\n| unit =\n| otherunits =\n| symbols = '''''L'''''\n| baseunits = kg m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>\n| dimension = '''M''' '''L'''<sup>2</sup> '''T'''<sup>\u22121</sup>\n| extensive =\n| intensive =\n| conserved = yes\n| transformsas =\n| derivations =  {{math|'''L''' {{=}} '''I'''&omega; {{=}} '''r''' \u00d7 '''p'''}}\n}}\n{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}\nIn [[physics]], '''angular momentum''' (rarely, '''moment of momentum''' or '''rotational momentum''') is the rotational equivalent of [[linear momentum]]. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]\u2014the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external [[torque]].\n\nIn three [[dimensions]], the angular momentum for a [[point particle]] is a [[pseudovector]] '''r''' \u00d7 '''p''', the [[cross product]] of the particle's [[position vector]] '''r''' (relative to some origin) and its [[momentum vector]] '''p''' = ''m'''''v'''. This definition can be applied to each point in [[Continuum mechanics|continua]] like solids or fluids, or [[field (physics)|physical fields]]. Unlike momentum, angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen, since the particle's position is measured from it. The angular momentum vector of a point particle is parallel and directly proportional to the [[angular velocity]] vector '''\u03c9''' of the particle (how fast its angular position changes), where the constant of proportionality depends on both the mass of the particle and its distance from origin. For continuous rigid bodies, though,  the spin angular velocity '''\u03c9''' is proportional but not always parallel to the [[Spin (physics)|spin angular momentum]] of the object, making the constant of proportionality '''I''' (called the [[moment of inertia]]) a second-rank [[tensor]] rather than a scalar.\n\nAngular momentum is additive; the total angular momentum of a system is the (pseudo)[[vector sum]] of the angular momenta. For continua or fields one uses [[Integral|integration]]. The total angular momentum of any rigid body can be split into the sum of two main components: the angular momentum of the [[centre of mass]] (with a mass equal to the total mass) about the origin, plus the spin angular momentum of the object about the centre of mass.\n\nTorque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum, analogous to [[force]]. The conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena, for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning [[figure skater]] as the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of [[neutron star]]s, the [[Coriolis effect]], and [[precession]] of [[Spinning top|tops]] and gyroscopes. Applications include the [[gyrocompass]], [[control moment gyroscope]], [[Inertial navigation system|inertial guidance systems]], [[reaction wheel]]s, [[Flying disc|flying discs or Frisbees]], and [[Earth's rotation]] to name a few. In general, conservation does limit the possible motion of a system, but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is.\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], [[angular momentum operator|angular momentum is an operator]] with quantized eigenvalues. Angular momentum is subject to the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], meaning that at any time, only one component can be measured with definite precision; the other two cannot. Also, the \"[[spin (physics)|spin]]\" of [[elementary particle]]s does not correspond to literal spinning motion.<ref>{{cite book |title=Understanding the Properties of Matter |edition=2nd, illustrated, revised |first1=Michael |last1=de Podesta |publisher=CRC Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-415-25788-6 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ya-4enCDoWQC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ya-4enCDoWQC&pg=PA29 Extract of page 29]</ref>\n\n==Angular momentum in classical mechanics==\n\n=== Definition ===\n{{Main|Scalar (physics)|Euclidean vector}}\n\n==== Scalar \u2014 angular momentum in two dimensions ====\n[[File:Ang mom 2d.png|right|thumb|[[Velocity]] of the [[particle]] ''m'' with respect to the origin ''O'' can be resolved into components parallel to (''v''<sub>\u2225</sub>) and perpendicular to (''v''<sub>\u22a5</sub>) the radius vector ''r''.

If the net force on some body is directed always toward some point, the ''center'', then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, as all of the force is directed along the [[Position (vector)|radius vector]], and none is [[perpendicular]] to the radius. Mathematically, torque <math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0}, </math> because in this case <math>\\mathbf{r}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> are parallel vectors. Therefore, the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. This is the case with [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] in the [[orbit]]s of [[planet]]s and [[satellite]]s, where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used in the analysis of the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]].\n\nFor a planet, angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit, and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms. The conservation of angular momentum in the [[Lunar theory|Earth\u2013Moon system]] results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon, due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal torque]] the Moon exerts on the Earth. This in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth, at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day,<ref>{{cite journal\n| title      =Long-term changes in the rotation of the earth \u2013 700 B.C. to A.D. 1980\n|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\n|volume = 313\n| issue      =1524\n| last1       =Stephenson\n| first1      =F.

This causes the [[Spinning top|top]] to [[precess]].]]\n\nThe conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an [[Ice skating|ice skater]] as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of [[moment of inertia]] and [[angular velocity]], if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.\n\nThe same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s) when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars. Decrease in the size of an object ''n'' times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of ''n''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nConservation is not always a full explanation for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint. For example, a spinning [[top]] is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the [[nutation]] axis, but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact, it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis, and another about its [[precession]] axis. Also, in any [[planetary system]], the planets, star(s), comets, and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved.\n\n[[Noether's theorem]] states that every [[conservation law]] is associated with a [[symmetry]] (invariant) of the underlying physics.  The symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is [[rotational invariance]].  The fact that the physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis implies that angular momentum is conserved.<ref>{{cite book| title=The classical theory of fields|series=Course of Theoretical Physics|first1= L.

In this formalism, angular momentum is the [[2-form]] [[Noether charge]] associated with rotational invariance.

In Cartesian coordinates:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{L} &= \\left(xp_y - yp_x\\right)\\mathbf{e}_x \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_y + \\left(yp_z - zp_y\\right)\\mathbf{e}_y \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_z + \\left(zp_x - xp_z\\right)\\mathbf{e}_z \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_x\\\\\n             &= L_{xy}\\mathbf{e}_x \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_y + L_{yz}\\mathbf{e}_y \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_z + L_{zx}\\mathbf{e}_z \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_x \\,,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nor more compactly in index notation:\n\n:<math>L_{ij} = x_i p_j - x_j p_i\\,.</math>\n\nThe angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order tensor, with components ''\u03c9<sub>ij</sub>''. The relation between the two antisymmetric tensors is given by the moment of inertia which must now be a fourth order tensor:<ref>Synge and Schild, Tensor calculus, Dover publications, 1978 edition, p. 161. {{ISBN|978-0-486-63612-2}}.</ref>\n\n:<math>L_{ij} = I_{ijk\\ell} \\omega_{k\\ell} \\,. </math>\n\nAgain, this equation in '''L''' and '''\u03c9''' as tensors is true in any number of dimensions. This equation also appears in the [[geometric algebra]] formalism, in which '''L''' and '''\u03c9''' are bivectors, and the moment of inertia is a mapping between them.\n\nIn [[relativistic mechanics]], the [[relativistic angular momentum]] of a particle is expressed as an [[antisymmetric tensor]] of second order:\n\n:<math>M_{\\alpha\\beta} = X_\\alpha P_\\beta - X_\\beta P_\\alpha</math>\n\nin the language of [[four-vector]]s, namely the [[Four-position|four position]] ''X'' and the [[four momentum]] ''P'', and absorbs the above '''L''' together with the motion of the [[centre of mass]] of the particle.\n\nIn each of the above cases, for a system of particles, the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta, and the centre of mass is for the system.\n\n== Angular momentum in quantum mechanics ==\n{{Main|Angular momentum operator}}\nAngular momentum in [[quantum mechanics]] differs in many profound respects from angular momentum in [[classical mechanics]].

'''L''' is then an [[Operator (physics)|operator]], specifically called the ''[[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum operator]]''. The components of the angular momentum operator satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra so(3). Indeed, these operators are precisely the infinitesimal action of the rotation group on the quantum Hilbert space.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 17.3</ref> (See also the discussion below of the angular momentum operators as the generators of rotations.)\n\nHowever, in quantum physics, there is another type of angular momentum, called ''[[spin (physics)|spin angular momentum]]'', represented by the spin operator '''S'''. Almost all [[elementary particle]]s have spin. Spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis, but this is a misleading and inaccurate picture: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort of motion in space and fundamentally different from orbital angular momentum. All [[elementary particle]]s have a characteristic spin, for example [[electron]]s have \"spin 1/2\" (this actually means \"spin [[reduced Planck constant|\u0127]]/2\") while [[photon]]s   have \"spin 1\" (this actually means \"spin \u0127\").\n\nFinally, there is [[total angular momentum]] '''J''', which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields. (For one particle, '''J''' = '''L''' + '''S'''.) [[Conservation of angular momentum]] applies to '''J''', but not to '''L''' or '''S'''; for example, the [[spin\u2013orbit interaction]] allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between '''L''' and '''S''', with the total remaining constant.  Electrons and photons need not have integer-based values for total angular momentum, but can also have fractional values.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501748|pmid=28861467|title=There are many ways to spin a photon: Half-quantization of a total optical angular momentum|journal=Science Advances|volume=2|issue=4|pages=e1501748|year=2016|last1=Ballantine|first1=K.

A standing wave like this can have 0,1,2, or any integer number of wavelengths around the circle, but it ''cannot'' have a non-integer number of wavelengths like 8.3. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized for a similar reason.]]\n(There are additional restrictions as well, see [[angular momentum operator]] for details.)\n\nThe [[reduced Planck constant]] <math>\\hbar</math> is tiny by everyday standards, about 10<sup>\u221234</sup> [[Joule-second|J s]], and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects. However, it is very important in the microscopic world. For example, the structure of [[electron shell]]s and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentum.\n\nQuantization of angular momentum was first postulated by [[Niels Bohr]] in his [[Bohr model]] of the atom and was later predicted by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] in his [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation#Quantization|Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\n\n=== Uncertainty ===\nIn the definition <math>\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{p}</math>, six operators are involved: The [[position operator]]s <math>r_x</math>, <math>r_y</math>, <math>r_z</math>, and the [[momentum operator]]s <math>p_x</math>, <math>p_y</math>, <math>p_z</math>. However, the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Therefore, there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle's angular momentum. It turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector's [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] and its component along one axis.\n\nThe uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an [[angular momentum operator]] do not [[commutator|commute]], for example <math>L_xL_y \\neq L_yL_x</math>. (For the precise [[commutation relation]]s, see [[angular momentum operator]].)\n\n=== Total angular momentum as generator of rotations ===\nAs mentioned above, orbital angular momentum '''L''' is defined as in classical mechanics: <math>\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{p}</math>, but ''total'' angular momentum '''J''' is defined in a different, more basic way: '''J''' is defined as the \"generator of rotations\".<ref name=littlejohn>{{cite web|url=http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1011/notes/spinrot.pdf|title= Lecture notes on rotations in quantum mechanics|first= Robert |last=Littlejohn|accessdate= 13 Jan 2012|work=Physics 221B Spring 2011|year=2011}}</ref> More specifically, '''J''' is defined so that the operator\n:<math>R(\\hat{n},\\phi) \\equiv \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\phi\\, \\mathbf{J}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}\\right)</math>\nis the [[Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]] that takes any system and rotates it by angle <math>\\phi</math> about the axis <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}</math>. (The \"exp\" in the formula refers to [[matrix exponential|operator exponential]]) To put this the other way around, whatever our quantum Hilbert space is, we expect that the [[rotation group SO(3)]] will act on it. There is then an associated action of the Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3); the operators describing the action of so(3) on our Hilbert space are the (total) angular momentum operators.\n\nThe relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between [[Lie algebra]]s and [[Lie group]]s in mathematics. The close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in [[Noether's theorem]] that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant.\n\n== Angular momentum in electrodynamics ==\n{{See also|Momentum#Particle in field|l1=Momentum (Particle in field)}}\n\nWhen describing the motion of a [[charged particle]] in an [[electromagnetic field]], the [[canonical momentum]] '''P''' (derived from the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] for this system) is not [[gauge invariant]]. As a consequence, the canonical angular momentum '''L''' = '''r''' \u00d7 '''P''' is not gauge invariant either. Instead, the momentum that is physical, the so-called ''kinetic momentum'' (used throughout this article), is (in [[SI units]])\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = m\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{P} - e \\mathbf{A} </math>\n\nwhere ''e'' is the [[electric charge]] of the particle and '''A''' the [[magnetic vector potential]] of the electromagnetic field.

This had been known since [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] expounded his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|second law of planetary motion]]. Newton derived a unique geometric proof, and went on to show that the attractive force of the Sun's [[gravity]] was the cause of all of Kepler's laws.\n\nDuring the first interval of time, an object is in motion from point '''A''' to point '''B'''. Undisturbed, it would continue to point '''c''' during the second interval. When the object arrives at '''B''', it receives an impulse directed toward point '''S'''. The impulse gives it a small added velocity toward '''S''', such that if this were its only velocity, it would move from '''B''' to '''V''' during the second interval. By the [[Parallelogram of force|rules of velocity composition]], these two velocities add, and point '''C''' is found by construction of parallelogram '''BcCV'''. Thus the object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point '''C''' at the end of the second interval. Because the triangles '''SBc''' and '''SBC''' have the same base '''SB''' and the same height '''Bc''' or '''VC''', they have the same area. By symmetry, triangle '''SBc''' also has the same area as triangle '''SAB''', therefore the object has swept out equal areas '''SAB''' and '''SBC''' in equal times.\n\nAt point '''C''', the object receives another impulse toward '''S''', again deflecting its path during the third interval from '''d''' to '''D'''. Thus it continues to '''E''' and beyond, the triangles '''SAB''', '''SBc''', '''SBC''', '''SCd''', '''SCD''', '''SDe''', '''SDE''' all having the same area. Allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller, the path '''ABCDE''' approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curve.\n\nNote that because this derivation is geometric, and no specific force is applied, it proves a more general law than Kepler's second law of planetary motion. It shows that the Law of Areas applies to any central force, attractive or repulsive, continuous or non-continuous, or zero.\n\n==== Conservation of angular momentum in the Law of Areas ====\nThe proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles, that is, the lines from '''S''' to the object, are equivalent to the [[Angular momentum#Scalar \u2013 angular momentum in two dimensions|radius {{math|<var>r</var>}}]], and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of [[Angular momentum#Scalar \u2013 angular momentum in two dimensions|velocity {{math|<VAR>v</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}}]]. Hence, if the area swept per unit time is constant, then by the triangular area formula {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}(base)(height)}}, the product {{math|(base)(height)}} and therefore the product {{math|<VAR>rv</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}} are constant: if {{math|<VAR>r</var>}} and the base length are decreased, {{math|<VAR>v</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}} and height must increase proportionally. Mass is constant, therefore [[Angular momentum#Scalar \u2013 angular momentum in two dimensions|angular momentum {{math|<VAR>rmv</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}}]] is conserved by this exchange of distance and velocity.\n\nIn the case of triangle '''SBC''', area is equal to {{sfrac|1|2}}('''SB''')('''VC'''). Wherever '''C''' is eventually located due to the impulse applied at '''B''', the product ('''SB''')('''VC'''), and therefore {{math|<VAR>rmv</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}} remain constant. Similarly so for each of the triangles.\n\n=== After Newton ===\n[[Leonhard Euler]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and [[Patrick d'Arcy]] all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of [[areal velocity]], a result of their analysis of Kepler's second law of planetary motion. It is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter.<ref>see {{cite web\n|url=http://weatherglass.de/PDFs/Angular_momentum.pdf\n|last=Borrelli\n|first=Arianna\n|date=2011\n|title=Angular momentum between physics and mathematics}} for an excellent and detailed summary of the concept of angular momentum through history.</ref>\n\nIn 1736 Euler, like Newton, touched on some of the equations of angular momentum in his ''[[Mechanica]]'' without further developing them.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/mechanica1.html\n|title=Euler : Mechanica Vol. 1\n|last=Bruce\n|first=Ian\n|date=2008}}</ref>\n\nBernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a \"moment of rotational motion\", possibly the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand it.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://eulerarchive.maa.org/correspondence/letters/OO0153.pdf\n|title=Euler's Correspondence with Daniel Bernoulli, Bernoulli to Euler, 04 February, 1744}}, at [http://eulerarchive.maa.org/ The Euler Archive]</ref>\n\nIn 1799, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] first realized that a fixed plane was associated with rotation \u2014 his ''[[invariable plane]]''.\n\n[[Louis Poinsot]] in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment perpendicular to the rotation, and elaborated on the \"conservation of moments\".\n\nIn 1852 [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] used a [[gyroscope]] in an experiment to display the Earth's rotation.\n\n[[William John Macquorn Rankine|William J. M. Rankine's]] 1858 ''Manual of Applied Mechanics'' defined angular momentum in the modern sense for the first time:\n:''...a line whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the angular momentum, and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of motion of the body and of the fixed point, and such, that when the motion of the body is viewed from the extremity of the line, the radius-vector of the body seems to have right-handed rotation.''\n\nIn an 1872 edition of the same book, Rankine stated that \"The term ''angular momentum'' was introduced by Mr. Hayward,\"<ref>{{cite book\n|last1 = Rankine\n|first1 = W.

First proposed by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1904<ref>{{cite web |date=27 August 2009 |title=Plum Pudding Model |publisher=''Universe Today'' |url=http://www.universetoday.com/38326/plum-pudding-model/ |accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref> soon after the discovery of the [[electron]], but before the discovery of the [[atomic nucleus]], the model represented an attempt to consolidate the known properties of atoms at the time: 1) electrons are negatively-charged particles and 2) atoms are neutrally-charged.\n\n==Overview==\nIn this model, atoms were known to consist of negatively charged electrons. Though Thomson called them \"[[particle|corpuscles]]\", they were more commonly called \"electrons\" as [[G. J. Stoney]] proposed in 1894.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Stoney |first=G. Johnstone |authorlink=G. J. Stoney\n |date=October 1894\n |title=Of the 'Electron' or Atom of Electricity\n |journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]] |series=5\n |doi=10.1080/14786449408620653\n |volume=38 |issue=233 |pages=418\u2013420\n |url=http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Stoney-1894.html\n}}</ref> At the time, atoms were known to be neutrally charged. To account for this, Thomson knew atoms must also have a source of positive charge to balance the negative charge of the electrons. He considered three plausible models that would satisfy the known properties of atoms at the time:\n\n# Each negatively-charged electron was paired with a positively-charged particle that followed it everywhere within the atom.\n# Negatively-charged electrons orbited a central region of positive charge having the same magnitude as all the electrons.\n# The negative electrons occupied a region of space that itself was a uniform positive charge (often considered as a kind of \"soup\" or \"cloud\" of positive charge).\n\nThomson chose the third possibility as the most likely structure of atoms. Thomson published his proposed model in the March 1904 edition of the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', the leading British science journal of the day.  In Thomson's view:\n<blockquote>... the atoms of the elements consist of a number of negatively electrified corpuscles enclosed in a sphere of uniform positive electrification, ...<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Thomson |first=J. J. |authorlink=J. J. Thomson\n |date=March 1904\n |title=On the Structure of the Atom: an Investigation of the Stability and Periods of Oscillation of a number of Corpuscles arranged at equal intervals around the Circumference of a Circle; with Application of the Results to the Theory of Atomic Structure\n |journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]\n |series=Sixth\n |doi=10.1080/14786440409463107\n |volume=7 |number=39 |pages=237\u2013265\n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWith this model, Thomson abandoned his earlier \"nebular atom\" hypothesis in which atoms were composed of immaterial vortices. Being an astute and practical scientist, Thomson based his atomic model on known experimental evidence of the day. His proposal of a positive volume charge reflects the nature of his scientific approach to discovery which was to propose ideas to guide future experiments.\n\nThe orbits of electrons within the model were stabilized by the fact that when an electron moved away from the centre of the positively-charged sphere, it was subjected to a greater net positive inward force, because there was more positive charge inside its orbit (see [[Gauss's law]]). Electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions among the electrons, and spectroscopic measurements were meant to account for energy differences associated with different electron rings. Thomson attempted unsuccessfully to reshape his model to account for some of the major spectral lines experimentally known for several elements.\n\nThe plum pudding model usefully guided his student, [[Ernest Rutherford]], to devise experiments to further explore the composition of atoms. As well, Thomson's model (along with a similar [[Saturnian model|Saturnian ring model for atomic electrons]] put forward in 1904 by [[Hantaro Nagaoka|Nagaoka]] after [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s [[Rings of Saturn#History|model of Saturn's rings]]), were useful predecessors of the more correct solar-system-like [[Bohr model]] of the atom.\n\nThe colloquial nickname \"plum pudding\" was soon attributed to Thomson's model as the distribution of electrons within its positively-charged region of space reminded many scientists of \"[[plum]]s\" in the common English dessert, [[plum pudding]].\n\nIn 1909, [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]] conducted [[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment|experiments with thin sheets of gold]]. Their professor, Ernest Rutherford, expected to find results consistent with Thomson's atomic model. It wasn't until 1911 that Rutherford correctly interpreted the experiment's results<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Angelo |first=Joseph A. \n |year=2004\n |title=Nuclear Technology\n |page=110 <!--maybe also pg 68? \nAlso, this source only says that the experiments began in 1909 and that Rutherford _published_ the results in 1911, nothing about when he interpreted the results.

I'll check when I get back to my academic institution and see if they have access.\n-->\n |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing]]\n |isbn=1-57356-336-6\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n |editor-last=Lakhtakia |editor-first=Akhlesh\n |last=Salpeter |first=Edwin E.\n |year=1996\n |title=Models and Modelers of Hydrogen\n |journal=American Journal of Physics\n |publisher=World Scientific\n |isbn=981-02-2302-1\n |bibcode=1997AmJPh..65..933L\n |doi=10.1119/1.18691\n |volume=65 |issue=9 |pages=933\n}}</ref> which implied the presence of a very small nucleus of positive charge at the center of gold atoms. This led to the development of the [[Rutherford model]] of the atom. Immediately after Rutherford published his results, [[Antonius Van den Broek]] made the intuitive proposal that the atomic number of an atom is the total number of units of charge present in its nucleus. [[Henry Moseley]]'s 1913 experiments (see [[Moseley's law]]) provided the necessary evidence to support Van den Broek's proposal. The effective nuclear charge was found to be consistent with the atomic number (Moseley found only one unit of charge difference). This work culminated in the solar-system-like (but quantum-limited) [[Bohr model]] of the atom in the same year, in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charges is surrounded by an equal number of electrons in orbital shells. As Thomson's model guided Rutherford's experiments, Bohr's model guided Moseley's research.\n\n==Related scientific problems==\nThe plum pudding model with a single electron was used in part by the physicist [[Arthur Erich Haas]] in 1910 to estimate the numerical value of [[Planck's constant]] and the [[Bohr radius]] of hydrogen atoms. Haas' work estimated these values to within an order of magnitude and preceded the work of [[Niels Bohr]] by three years. Of note, the [[Bohr model]] itself only provides substantially-reasonable predictions for [[atom]]ic and [[ion]]ic systems having a single effective electron.\n\nA particularly useful mathematics problem related to the plum pudding model is the optimal distribution of equal point charges on a unit sphere called the [[Thomson problem]]. The Thomson problem is a natural consequence of the plum pudding model in the absence of its uniform positive background charge.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Levin |first1=Y. |last2=Arenzon |first2=J.

The electrostatic N-electron configurations are found to be exceptionally close to solutions found in the Thomson problem with electrons residing at the same radius within the dielectric sphere. Notably, the plotted distribution of geometry-dependent energetics has been shown to bear a remarkable resemblance to the distribution of anticipated electron orbitals in natural atoms as arranged on the [[periodic table]] of elements.<ref name=lafave/> Of great interest, solutions of the Thomson problem exhibit this corresponding energy distribution by comparing the energy of each N-electron solution with the energy of its neighbouring (N-1)-electron solution with one charge at the origin. However, when treated within a dielectric sphere model, the features of the distribution are much more pronounced and provide greater fidelity with respect to electron orbital arrangements in real atoms.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=LaFave |first=T., Jr.\n |year=2014\n |title=Discrete transformations in the Thomson Problem\n |journal=J.
