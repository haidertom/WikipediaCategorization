It is also widely naturalized in many places, including most of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].\n\nIt is a grey-leaved [[herbaceous]] [[perennial plant]], and grows to {{convert|25|-|45|cm|0}} tall. The leaves are {{convert|2|-|5|cm|1|abbr=on}} long with a densely crinkled surface, and are covered in downy hairs. The [[flower]]s are white, borne in clusters on the upper part of the main stem.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[Oxford English Dictionary]] derives the word from two [[Old English]] forms: \"hoar\" (\"white,\" \"light-colored,\" as in \"hoarfrost\") and \"hune\" a word of unknown origin designating a class of herbs or plants. The second element was altered by [[folk etymology]].\n\n==Medicinal usage==\n===Historical===\n[[File:De medicina V00117 00000006.tif|thumb|''De medicina'']]\nHorehound has been mentioned in conjunction with medicinal use dating at least back to the 1st century BC, where it appeared as a remedy for respiratory ailments in the treatise ''[[De Medicina]]'' by Roman encyclopaedist [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Celsus/4*.html#9|title=LacusCurtius \u2022 Celsus \u2014 On Medicine \u2014 Book IV|website=Penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref> The Roman agricultural writer [[Columella]] lists it as a remedy for expelling worms in farm animals in his important first-century work ''On Agriculture''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archive.org/stream/onagriculturewit02coluuoft/onagriculturewit02coluuoft_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"On agriculture, with a recension of the text and an English translation by Harrison Boyd Ash\"|website=Archive.org|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref> Since then, horehound has appeared for similar purposes in numerous [[herbal]]s over the centuries, such as ''The Herball, or, Generall historie of plantes'' by [[John Gerard]], and ''Every Man His Own Doctor: or, The Poor Planter\u2019s Physician'' by Dr. John Tennent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/becomingamer/ideas/text7/homemedicalguides.pdf|format=PDF|title= Every Man His Own Doctor: OR, The Poor Planter\u2019s Physician, ca. 1727|author=Dr. John Tennent|website=Nationalhumanitiescenter.org|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Culinary uses==\nHorehound is used to make hard [[Throat lozenge|lozenge]] [[candy|candies]] that are considered by [[folk medicine]] to aid digestion, soothe sore throats, and relieve inflammation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tennant|first=John|title=Every Man His Own Doctor|year=1727|page=10}}</ref>\n\nIt is also used in beverages, such as [[horehound beer]], steeped as tea (similar to the [[Maghrebi mint tea]]), and in the [[rock and rye]] cocktail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imbibemagazine.com/rock-rye-recipe/|title=Rock & Rye - Imbibe Magazine|website=Imbibemagazine.com|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==As an invasive weed==\nHorehound was introduced to southern [[Australia]] in the 19th century as a medicinal herb.  It became a weed of native grasslands and pastures where it was introduced with settlers\u2019 livestock, and was first declared under [[noxious weed]]s legislation. It now appears to have reached its full potential distribution.\n\nIt occupies disturbed or overgrazed ground, and is favoured by grazing because it is highly unpalatable to livestock. It may persist in native vegetation that has been grazed.\n\n==As biocontrol==\n''Marrubium vulgare'' is also used as a natural [[grasshopper]] [[Insect repellent|repellent]] in agriculture.\n\n==In astrology==\nAccording to [[John Gower]] in Book 7 of the ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'', this plant was the herb of the fourth star of Nectanebus' astrology, [[Capella (star)|Capella]]. Gower uses the older name, Alhaiot (VII:1338).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Marrubium vulgare.JPG|Wild horehound\nImage:Marrubium_vulgare0.jpg|flowers\nImage:Marrubium vulgare.jpg|foliage of young plants\nImage:Horehound bug.jpg|Horehound bug, a common [[insect]] that feeds on White Horehound\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Everist, D.L.

Weight loss, sometimes significant, may occur despite a good appetite (though 10% of people with a hyperactive thyroid experience weight gain), vomiting may occur, and, for women, menstrual flow may lighten and menstrual periods may occur less often, or with longer cycles than usual.\n\nThyroid hormone is critical to normal function of cells. In excess, it both overstimulates metabolism and exacerbates the effect of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], causing \"speeding up\" of various body systems and symptoms resembling an overdose of [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline).

Extraocular muscle weakness may present with double vision. In lid-lag ([[von Graefe's sign]]), when the patient tracks an object downward with their eyes, the eyelid fails to follow the downward moving iris, and the same type of upper globe exposure which is seen with lid retraction occurs, temporarily. These signs disappear with treatment of the hyperthyroidism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nNeither of these ocular signs should be confused with [[exophthalmos]] (protrusion of the eyeball), which occurs specifically and uniquely in hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease (note that not all exophthalmos is caused by Graves' disease, but when present with hyperthyroidism is diagnostic of Graves' disease). This forward protrusion of the eyes is due to immune-mediated inflammation in the retro-orbital (eye socket) fat.

Last literature review version 19.1: January 2011. This topic last updated: 2 July 2009</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nMeasuring the level of [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), produced by the pituitary gland (which in turn is also regulated by the hypothalamus's TSH Releasing Hormone) in the blood is typically the initial test for suspected hyperthyroidism. A low TSH level typically indicates that the pituitary gland is being inhibited or \"instructed\" by the brain to cut back on stimulating the thyroid gland, having sensed increased levels of T<sub>4</sub> and/or T<sub>3</sub> in the blood. In rare circumstances, a low TSH indicates primary failure of the pituitary, or temporary inhibition of the pituitary due to another illness ([[euthyroid sick syndrome]]) and so checking the T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> is still clinically useful.\n\nMeasuring specific [[antibody|antibodies]], such as anti-TSH-receptor antibodies in Graves' disease, or anti-thyroid peroxidase in [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] \u2014 a common cause of [[hypothyroidism]] \u2014 may also contribute to the diagnosis.\n\nThe diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is confirmed by blood tests that show a decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and elevated T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> levels. TSH is a hormone made by the pituitary gland in the brain that tells the thyroid gland how much hormone to make. When there is too much thyroid hormone, the TSH will be low. A radioactive iodine uptake test and thyroid scan together characterizes or enables radiologists and doctors to determine the cause of hyperthyroidism. The uptake test uses radioactive iodine injected or taken orally on an empty stomach to measure the amount of iodine absorbed by the thyroid gland. Persons with hyperthyroidism absorb much more iodine than healthy persons which includes the radioactive iodine which is easy to measure.  A thyroid scan producing images is typically conducted in connection with the uptake test to allow visual examination of the over-functioning gland.\n\nThyroid [[scintigraphy]] is a useful test to characterize (distinguish between causes of) hyperthyroidism, and this entity from thyroiditis. This test procedure typically involves two tests performed in connection with each other: an [[Radioactive iodine uptake test|iodine uptake test]] and a scan (imaging) with a [[gamma camera]]. The uptake test involves administering a dose of radioactive iodine (radioiodine), traditionally [[iodine-131]] (<sup>131</sup>I), and more recently [[iodine-123]] (<sup>123</sup>I). [[Iodine-123]] may be the preferred radionuclide in some clinics due to its more favorable radiation [[dosimetry]] (i.e. less radiation dose to the patient per unit administered radioactivity) and a gamma photon energy more amenable to imaging with the [[gamma camera]]. For the imaging scan, I-123 is considered an almost ideal isotope of iodine for imaging thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer metastasis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/43/1/77 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012074621/http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/43/1/77 |archivedate=12 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nTypical administration involves a pill or liquid containing sodium iodide (NaI) taken orally, which contains a small amount of [[iodine-131]], amounting to perhaps less than a grain of salt. A 2-hour fast of no food prior to and for 1 hour after ingesting the pill is required. This low dose of radioiodine is typically tolerated by individuals otherwise allergic to iodine (such as those unable to tolerate contrast mediums containing larger doses of iodine such as used in [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]], [[intravenous pyelogram]] (IVP), and similar imaging diagnostic procedures). Excess radioiodine that does not get absorbed into the thyroid gland is eliminated by the body in urine. Some patients may experience a slight allergic reaction to the diagnostic radioiodine and may be given an [[antihistamine]].\n\nThe patient returns 24 hours later to have the level of radioiodine \"uptake\" (absorbed by the thyroid gland) measured by a device with a metal bar placed against the neck, which measures the radioactivity emitting from the thyroid. This test takes about 4&nbsp;minutes while the uptake % is accumulated (calculated) by the machine software. A scan is also performed, wherein images (typically a center, left and right angle) are taken of the contrasted thyroid gland with a [[gamma camera]]; a [[radiologist]] will read and prepare a report indicating the uptake % and comments after examining the images. Hyperthyroid patients will typically \"take up\" higher than normal levels of radioiodine. Normal ranges for RAI uptake are from 10-30%.\n\nIn addition to testing the TSH levels, many doctors test for T<sub>3</sub>, Free T<sub>3</sub>, T<sub>4</sub>, and/or Free T<sub>4</sub> for more detailed results. Typical adult limits for these hormones are: TSH (units): 0.45 - 4.50 uIU/mL; T<sub>4</sub> Free/Direct (nanograms): 0.82 - 1.77&nbsp;ng/dl; and T<sub>3</sub> (nanograms): 71 - 180&nbsp;ng/dl. Persons with hyperthyroidism can easily exhibit levels many times these upper limits for T<sub>4</sub> and/or T<sub>3</sub>. See a complete table of normal range limits for thyroid function at the [[thyroid gland]] article.\n\nIn hyperthyroidism CK-MB ([[Creatine kinase]]) is usually elevated.<ref>Differential diagnosis by laboratory medicine: a quick reference for physicians; Vincent Marks, Du\u0161an Me\u0161ko, page 156</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Hyperthyroidism (1).jpg\nImage:Hyperthyroidism (2).jpg\nImage:Hyperthyroidism (3).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Subclinical===\n{{See also|Symptoms and signs of Graves' disease#Subclinical hyperthyroidism}}\nIn overt primary hyperthyroidism, TSH levels are low and T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> levels are high.

Thyrostatics are believed to work by inhibiting the [[iodination]] of [[thyroglobulin]] by [[thyroperoxidase]] and, thus, the formation of tetraiodothyronine (T<sub>4</sub>). Propylthiouracil also works outside the thyroid gland, preventing the conversion of (mostly inactive) T<sub>4</sub> to the active form T<sub>3</sub>. Because thyroid tissue usually contains a substantial reserve of thyroid hormone, thyrostatics can take weeks to become effective and the dose often needs to be carefully titrated over a period of months, with regular doctor visits and blood tests to monitor results.\n\nA very high dose is often needed early in treatment, but, if too high a dose is used persistently, patients can develop symptoms of hypothyroidism. This titrating of the dose is difficult to do accurately, and so sometimes a \"block and replace\" attitude is taken. In block and replace treatments thyrostatics are taken in sufficient quantities to completely block thyroid hormones, and the patient treated as though they have complete hypothyroidism.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fumarola|first1=A|last2=Di Fiore|first2=A|last3=Dainelli|first3=M|last4=Grani|first4=G|last5=Calvanese|first5=A|title=Medical treatment of hyperthyroidism: state of the art.|journal=Experimental and Clinical Endocrinology & Diabetes|date=Nov 2010|volume=118|issue=10|pages=678\u201384|pmid=20496313|doi=10.1055/s-0030-1253420}}</ref>\n\n===Beta-blockers===\nMany of the common symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as palpitations, trembling, and anxiety are mediated by increases in beta-adrenergic receptors on cell surfaces. [[Beta blockers]], typically used to treat high blood pressure, are a class of drugs that offset this effect, reducing rapid pulse associated with the sensation of palpitations, and decreasing tremor and anxiety. Thus, a patient suffering from hyperthyroidism can often obtain immediate temporary relief until the hyperthyroidism can be characterized with the Radioiodine test noted above and more permanent treatment take place. Note that these drugs do not treat hyperthyroidism or any of its long-term effects if left untreated, but, rather, they treat or reduce only symptoms of the condition.\n\nSome minimal effect on thyroid hormone production however also comes with [[Propranolol]] - which has two roles in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, determined by the different isomers of propranolol. L-propranolol causes beta-blockade, thus treating the symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism such as tremor, palpitations, anxiety, and [[heat intolerance]]. D-propranolol inhibits thyroxine deiodinase, thereby blocking the conversion of T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub>, providing some though minimal therapeutic effect. Other beta-blockers are used to treat only the symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Eber O, Buchinger W, Lindner W | year = 1990 | title = The effect of D-versus L-propranolol in the treatment of hyperthyroidism | url = | journal = Clin Endocrinol | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 363\u201372 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2265.1990.tb00877.x|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  [[Propranolol]] in the UK, and [[metoprolol]] in the US, are most frequently used to augment treatment for hyperthyroid patients.<ref name=pmid1352658>{{cite journal |vauthors=Geffner DL, Hershman JM |title=\u03b2-Adrenergic blockade for the treatment of hyperthyroidism |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=61\u20138 |date=July 1992 |pmid=1352658 |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(92)90681-Z}}</ref>\n\n===Diet===\nPeople with autoimmune hyperthyroidism (such as in [[Graves' disease|Grave's disease]]) should not eat foods high in iodine, such as [[edible seaweed]] and [[Kelp|kelps]].<ref name=NIH2012/>\n\nFrom a public health perspective, the general introduction of iodized salt in the United States in 1924 resulted in lower disease, goiters, as well as improving the lives of children whose mothers would not have eaten enough iodine during pregnancy which would have lowered the IQs of their children.<ref name=BI72213>{{cite news|title=How Adding Iodine To Salt Resulted In A Decade's Worth Of IQ Gains For The United States|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/iodization-effect-on-iq-2013-7|accessdate=July 23, 2013|newspaper=Business Insider|date=July 22, 2013|author=Max Nisen|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723154256/http://www.businessinsider.com/iodization-effect-on-iq-2013-7|archivedate=23 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Surgery===\n[[Surgery]] ([[thyroidectomy]] to remove the whole thyroid or a part of it) is not extensively used because most common forms of hyperthyroidism are quite effectively treated by the radioactive iodine method, and because there is a risk of also removing the [[parathyroid glands]], and of cutting the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]], making swallowing difficult, and even simply generalized [[staphylococcus|staphylococcal]] infection as with any major surgery.

Iodine-131, which also emits beta particles that are far more damaging to tissues at short range, has a half-life of approximately 8 days.  Patients not responding sufficiently to the first dose are sometimes given an additional radioiodine treatment, at a larger dose.

Radioiodine ablation has been used for over 50 years, and the only major reasons for not using it are pregnancy and breastfeeding ([[Breast|breast tissue]] also picks up and concentrates iodine). Once the thyroid function is reduced, replacement hormone therapy ([[levothyroxine]]) taken orally each day may easily provide the required amount of thyroid hormone the body needs.\n\nThere is extensive experience, over many years, of the use of radioiodine in the treatment of thyroid overactivity and this experience does not indicate any increased risk of thyroid cancer following treatment. However, a study from 2007 has reported an increased cancer incidence after radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism.<ref name=\"Pmid\" />\n\nThe principal advantage of radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism is that it tends to have a much higher success rate than medications. Depending on the dose of radioiodine chosen, and the disease under treatment (Graves' vs. toxic goiter, vs. hot nodule etc.), the success rate in achieving definitive resolution of the hyperthyroidism may vary from 75-100%. A major expected side-effect of radioiodine in patients with Graves' disease is the development of lifelong [[hypothyroidism]], requiring daily treatment with thyroid hormone. On occasion, some patients may require more than one radioactive treatment, depending on the type of disease present, the size of the thyroid, and the initial dose administered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mythyroid.com/iodinehyper.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305000205/http://www.mythyroid.com/iodinehyper.html |archivedate=5 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nGraves' disease patients manifesting moderate or severe [[Graves' ophthalmopathy]] are cautioned against radioactive iodine-131 treatment, since it has been shown to exacerbate existing thyroid eye disease.

In general, this happens as a result of thyroid hormones being released into the blood following the radioactive iodine-mediated destruction of thyroid cells that contain thyroid hormone. In some patients, treatment with medications such as [[beta blocker]]<nowiki/>s ([[propranolol]], [[atenolol]], etc.) may be useful during this period of time.\n\nMost patients do not experience any difficulty after the radioactive iodine treatment, usually given as a small pill. On occasion, neck tenderness or a sore throat may become apparent after a few days, if moderate inflammation in the thyroid develops and produces discomfort in the neck or throat area. This is usually transient, and not associated with a fever, etc.\n\nWomen breastfeeding should discontinue breastfeeding for at least a week, and likely longer, following radioactive iodine treatment, as small amounts of radioactive iodine may be found in breast milk even several weeks after the radioactive iodine treatment.\n\nA common outcome following radioiodine is a swing from hyperthyroidism to the easily treatable hypothyroidism, which occurs in 78% of those treated for Graves' thyrotoxicosis and in 40% of those with toxic multinodular goiter or solitary toxic adenoma.<ref name=pmid1710255>{{cite journal |vauthors=Berglund J, Christensen SB, Dymling JF, Hallengren B |title=The incidence of recurrence and hypothyroidism following treatment with antithyroid drugs, surgery or radioiodine in all patients with thyrotoxicosis in Malm\u00f6 during the period 1970-1974 |journal=Journal of Internal Medicine |volume=229 |issue=5 |pages=435\u201342 |date=May 1991 |pmid=1710255 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2796.1991.tb00371.x}}</ref> Use of higher doses of radioiodine reduces the incidence of treatment failure, with penalty for higher response to treatment consisting mostly of higher rates of eventual hypothyroidism which requires hormone treatment for life.<ref name=pmid16390021>{{cite journal |author=Esfahani AF |title=Comparative evaluation of two fixed doses of 185 and 370 MBq 131I, for the treatment of Graves' disease resistant to antithyroid drugs |journal=Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=158\u201361 |year=2005 |pmid=16390021 |author2=Kakhki VR |author3=Fallahi B |display-authors=3 |last4=Eftekhari |first4=M |last5=Beiki |first5=D |last6=Saghari |first6=M |last7=Takavar |first7=A}}</ref>\n\nThere is increased sensitivity to radioiodine therapy in thyroids appearing on [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound scans]] as more uniform (hypoechogenic), due to densely packed large cells, with 81% later becoming hypothyroid, compared to just 37% in those with more normal scan appearances (normoechogenic).<ref name=pmid17609305>{{cite journal |vauthors=Markovic V, Eterovic D |title=Thyroid echogenicity predicts outcome of radioiodine therapy in patients with Graves' disease |journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=3547\u201352 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17609305 |doi=10.1210/jc.2007-0879}}</ref>\n\n===Thyroid storm===\n[[Thyroid storm]] presents with extreme symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

However, recent research published in Environmental Science & Technology, a publication of the American Chemical Society, suggests that many cases of feline hyperthyroidism are associated with exposure to environmental contaminants called [[polybrominated diphenyl ethers]] (PBDEs), which are present in [[flame retardants]] in many household products, in particular, furniture and some electronics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mizukawa|first=Hazuki|last2=Nomiyama|first2=Kei|last3=Nakatsu|first3=Susumu|last4=Iwata|first4=Hisato|last5=Yoo|first5=Jean|last6=Kubota|first6=Akira|last7=Yamamoto|first7=Miyuki|last8=Ishizuka|first8=Mayumi|last9=Ikenaka|first9=Yoshinori|date=2016-01-05|title=Organohalogen Compounds in Pet Dog and Cat: Do Pets Biotransform Natural Brominated Products in Food to Harmful Hydroxlated Substances?|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=50|issue=1|pages=444\u2013452|doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b04216|issn=1520-5851|pmid=26630569}}</ref>\n\nThe study on which the report was based was conducted jointly by researchers at the EPA's National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory and Indiana University.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dye|first=Janice A.|last2=Venier|first2=Marta|last3=Zhu|first3=Lingyan|last4=Ward|first4=Cynthia R.|last5=Hites|first5=Ronald A.|last6=Birnbaum|first6=Linda S.|date=2007-09-15|title=Elevated PBDE levels in pet cats: sentinels for humans?|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=41|issue=18|pages=6350\u20136356|issn=0013-936X|pmid=17948778|doi=10.1021/es0708159}}</ref>  In the study, which involved 23 pet cats with feline hyperthyroidism, PBDE blood levels were three times as high as those in younger, non-hyperthyroid cats.

Many other factors may play a role in the [[pathogenesis]] of the disease such as [[goitrogen]]s ([[isoflavones]] such as [[genistein]], [[daidzein]], and [[quercetin]]) as well as the [[Iodine deficiency|iodine]] and [[selenium]] content of the cat's diet.\n\nThe most common presenting symptoms are: rapid [[weight loss]], [[tachycardia]] (rapid heart rate), [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], increased consumption of fluids ([[polydipsia]]) and food, and increased urine production ([[polyuria]]). Other symptoms include hyperactivity, possible aggression, [[heart murmurs]], a [[gallop rhythm]], an unkempt appearance, and large, thick [[claws]]. About 70% of afflicted cats also have enlarged thyroid glands ([[goiter]]).\n\nThe same three treatments used with humans are also options in treating feline hyperthyroidism (surgery, radioiodine treatment, and anti-thyroid drugs). The drug that is used to help reduce the hyperthyroidism is methimazole. Where drug therapy is used it must be given to cats for the remainder of their lives but this may be the least expensive option, especially for very old cats. Anti-thyroid drugs for cats are available in both pill form and in a [[topical medication|topical gel]], that is applied using a [[finger cot]] to the hairless skin inside a cat's ear. Many cat owners find this gel a good option for cats that don't like being given pills. Radioiodine treatment and surgery often cure hyperthyroidism but some veterinarians prefer radioiodine treatment over surgery because it doesn't carry the risks associated with [[anesthesia]].\n\nRadioiodine treatment, however, is not available in all areas for cats as this treatment requires nuclear radiological expertise and facilities as the cat's urine, sweat, saliva, and stool are radioactive for several days after the treatment requiring special inpatient handling and facilities usually for a total of 3 weeks (first week in total isolation and the next two weeks in close confinement).<ref>{{cite web|first=Susan |last=Little |title=Feline Hyperthyroidism |url=http://www.winnfelinehealth.org/Pages/Feline_Hyperthyroidism_Web.pdf |format=PDF |year=2006 |publisher=Winn Feline Foundation |accessdate=24 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509070957/http://www.winnfelinehealth.org/Pages/Feline_Hyperthyroidism_Web.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the United States, the guidelines for radiation levels vary from state to state; some states such as Massachusetts allow hospitalization for as little as two days before the animal is sent home with care instructions. Surgery tends to be done only when just one of the thyroid glands is affected (unilateral disease); however, following surgery, the remaining gland may become overactive. As in people, one of the most common complications of the surgery is [[hypothyroidism]].\n\n===Dogs===\nHyperthyroidism is much less common in [[dog]]s compared to cats.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Richard B.|last2=Mazzaferro|first2=Elisa|title=Kirk & Bistner's Handbook of Veterinary Procedures and Emergency Treatment|date=2011|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|location=London|isbn=9781437707991|page=346|edition=9th}}</ref> Hyperthyroidism may be caused by a thyroid tumor.

Transclusion is usually performed when the referencing document is displayed, and is normally automatic and transparent to the end user.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Glushko |editor-first=Robert J. |editor-link=Robert J. Glushko |date=2013 |title=The Discipline of Organizing |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=MIT Press |page=231 |isbn=9780262518505 }}</ref>  The result of transclusion is a single integrated document made of parts assembled dynamically from separate sources, possibly stored on different computers in disparate places.\n\nTransclusion facilitates [[modular design]]: a [[web resource|resource]]  is stored once and distributed for reuse in multiple documents. Updates or corrections to a resource are then reflected in any referencing documents.  [[Ted Nelson]] coined the term for his 1980 nonlinear book ''[[Literary Machines]]'', but the idea of ''master copy and occurrences'' was applied 17 years before, in [[Sketchpad]].\n\n==Technical considerations==\n\n===Context neutrality===\n\nTransclusion works better when transcluded sections of text are self-contained, so that the meaning and validity of the text is independent of context. For example, formulations like \"as explained in the previous section\" are problematic, because the transcluded section may appear in a different context, causing confusion. What constitutes \"context neutral\" text varies, but often includes things like company information or [[boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]].\n\n===Parameterization===\nUnder some circumstances, and in some technical contexts, transcluded sections of text may not require strict adherence to the \"context neutrality\" principle, because the transcluded sections are capable of ''parameterization''. Parameterization implies the ability to modify certain portions or subsections of a transcluded text depending on exogenous variables that can be changed independently. This is customarily done by supplying a transcluded text with one or more ''substitution placeholders''. These placeholders are then replaced with the corresponding variable values prior to rendering the final transcluded output in context.\n\n==History and implementation by Project Xanadu==\nTed Nelson, who also originated the words \"hypertext\" and \"[[hypermedia]]\", coined the term \"transclusion\" in his 1980 book ''[[Literary Machines]]''.  Part of his proposal was the idea that [[micropayment]]s could be automatically exacted from the reader for all the text, no matter how many snippets of content are taken from various places.\n\nHowever, according to Nelson, the concept of transclusion had already formed part of his 1965 description of [[hypertext]].<ref>Theodor H. Nelson, \"A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing and the Indeterminate.\" Proceedings of the ACM 20th National Conference (1965), pp. 84-100</ref>  Nelson defines transclusion as, \"...the same content knowably in more than one place,\" setting it apart from more special cases, such as the inclusion of content from a different location (which he calls ''transdelivery'') or an explicit [[quotation]] that remains connected to its origins, (which he calls ''transquotation'').\n\nSome hypertext systems, including Ted Nelson's own [[Project Xanadu|Xanadu Project]], support transclusion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://info.iicm.edu/iicm_papers/transclusions_in_HTML-based_environment.pdf|title=Transclusions in an HTML-Based Environment|last=Kolbitsch|first=Josef|last2=Maurer|first2=Hermann|date=January 27, 2017|website=|publisher=|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNelson has delivered a demonstration of Web transclusion, the Little Transquoter (programmed to Nelson's specification by Andrew Pam in 2004-2005).<ref>[http://www.xanadu.com.au/transquoter/ The Little Transquoter] Xanadu.com.au</ref>  It creates a new format built on portion addresses from Web pages; when dereferenced, each portion on the resulting page remains click-connected to its original context.\n\n==Implementation on the Web==\n\n[[HTTP]], as a transmission protocol, has rudimentary support for transclusion via [[byte serving]]: specifying a [[List of HTTP header fields#Range|byte range]] in an HTTP request message.\n\nTransclusion can occur either before (server-side) or after (client-side) transmission. For example:\n* An HTML document may be pre-composed by the server before delivery to the client using Server-Side Includes or another server-side application.\n* XML Entities or HTML Objects may be parsed by the client, which then requests the corresponding resources separately from the main document.\n* A web browser may cache elements using its own algorithms, which can operate without explicit directives in the document's markup.\n* [[AngularJS]] employs transclusion for nested directive operation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngTransclude|title=AngularJS|website=docs.angularjs.org|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref>\n\nPublishers of web content may object to the transclusion of material from their own web sites into other web sites, or they may require an agreement to do so. Critics of the practice may refer to various forms of [[inline linking]] as [[bandwidth theft]] or [[Leeching (computing)|leeching]].\n\nOther publishers may seek specifically to have their materials transcluded into other web sites, as in the form of [[web advertising]], or as [[Web widget|widgets]] like a [[hit counter]] or [[web bug]].\n\n[[mashup (web application hybrid)|Mashups]] make use of transclusion to assemble resources or data into a new application, as by placing [[Geo-tagging|geo-tagged]] photos on an interactive map, or by displaying business metrics in an interactive [[Dashboard (business)|dashboard]].\n\n===Client-side HTML===\n[[HTML]] defines elements for client-side transclusion of [[HTML element#Images and objects|images]], [[HTML scripting|scripts]], [[Style sheet (web development)|stylesheets]], [[Framing (World Wide Web)|other documents]], and [[HTML element#Images and objects|other types of media]].  HTML has relied heavily on client-side transclusion from the earliest days of the Web (so web pages could be displayed more quickly before multimedia elements finished loading), rather than embedding the raw data for such objects inline into a web page's markup.\n\nThrough techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], scripts associated with an HTML document can instruct a web browser to modify the document in-place, as opposed to the earlier technique of having to pull an entirely new version of the page from the web server. Such scripts may transclude elements or documents from a server after the web browser has rendered the page, in response to user input or changing conditions, for example.\n\nFuture versions of HTML may support deeper transclusion of portions of documents using [[XML]] technologies such as [[SGML entity|entities]], [[XPointer]] document referencing, and [[XSLT]] manipulations. XPointer is patented but is licensed under [[royalty-free]] terms<ref>[http://www.w3.org/2002/06/xptr_IPR_summary.html \"XPointer Patent Statements\"]. [[World Wide Web Consortium]].</ref>.\n\n[[Proxy server]]s may employ transclusion to reduce redundant transmissions of commonly requested resources.\n\nA popular Front End Framework known as [[AngularJS]] developed and maintained by [[Google]] has a directive callend ng-transclude that marks the insertion point for the transcluded DOM of the nearest parent directive that uses transclusion.\n\n===Server-side transclusion===\n\nTransclusion can be accomplished on the server side, as through [[Server Side Includes]] and [[SGML entity|markup entity references]] resolved by the server software. It is a feature of [[Web template|substitution templates]].\n\n===Transclusion of source code===\n\nTransclusion of source code into software design or reference materials lets source code be presented within the document, but not interpreted as part of the document, preserving the semantic consistency of the inserted code in relation to its source codebase.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Compound document]]\n* [[Cross-reference]]\n* [[Darwin Information Typing Architecture#Content reuse|Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA)]] and ''content reuse''\n* [[Macro (computer science)]]\n* [[Object Linking and Embedding|Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)]]\n* [[Publish and Subscribe (Mac OS)]]\n* [[Single source publishing]]\n* [[Subroutine]]\n* [[Include directive]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite conference\n  | last = Di Iorio\n  | first = A.\n  | last2 = Vitali\n  | first2 = F.\n  | title = A Xanalogical Collaborative Editing Environment\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the Second International Workshop of Web Document Analysis 2003 (WDA2003)\n  |date=August 2003\n  | location = Edinburgh, UK\n  | url = http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~wda2003/Papers/Section_III/Paper_11.pdf\n  | format = PDF\n }}\n* {{cite journal\n |last        = Kolbitsch\n |first       = J.\n |last2       = Maurer\n |first2      = H.\n |title       = Transclusions in an HTML-Based Environment\n |journal     = Journal of Computing and Information Technology\n |volume      = 14\n |issue       = 2\n |pages       = 161\u2013174\n |date        = June 2006\n |url         = http://cit.zesoi.fer.hr/browseIssue.php?issue=25\n |doi         = 10.2498/cit.2006.02.07\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070606203401/http://cit.zesoi.fer.hr/browseIssue.php?issue=25\n |archivedate = 2007-06-06\n |df          = \n}}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Kolbitsch\n  | first = J.\n  | title = Fine-Grained Transclusions of Multimedia Documents in HTML\n  | journal = Journal of Universal Computer Science\n  | volume = 11\n  | issue = 6\n  |date=June 2005\n  | url = http://www.jucs.org/jucs_11_6/fine_grained_transclusions_of/\n }}\n* {{cite conference\n |first       = H.\n |last        = Krottmaier\n |title       = Transcluded Documents: Advantages of Reusing Document Fragments\n |booktitle   = Proceedings of the 6th International ICCC/IFIP Conference on Electronic Publishing (ELPUB2002)\n |pages       = 359\u2013367\n |publisher   = Karlovy Vary\n |year        = 2002\n |location    = Czech Republic\n |url         = http://hkrott.iicm.edu/docs/publications/elpub-2002.pdf\n |format      = PDF\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20050517185446/http://hkrott.iicm.edu/docs/publications/elpub-2002.pdf\n |archivedate = 2005-05-17\n |df          = \n}}\n* {{cite conference\n  | first = H.\n  | last = Krottmaier\n  | first2 = Helic\n  | last2 = D.\n  | title = Issues of Transclusions\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, & Higher Education (E-Learn 2002)\n  | pages = 1730\u20131733\n  | year = 2002\n  | location = Montreal, Canada\n  | url = http://coronet.iicm.edu/denis/pubs/elearn2002b.pdf\n  | format = PDF\n }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Krottmaier\n  | first = H.\n  | last2 = Maurer\n  | first2 = H.\n  | title = Transclusions in the 21st Century\n  | journal = Journal of Universal Computer Science\n  | volume = 7\n  | issue = 12\n  | pages = 1125\u20131136\n  |date=July 2001\n  | url = http://www.jucs.org/jucs_7_12/transclusions_in_the_21st/\n  | format = [[PDF]], [[HTML]], [[PostScript]]\n | citeseerx = 10.1.1.106.9923\n  }}\n* {{cite conference\n  | first = A.\n  | last = Moore\n  | title = Personally tailored teaching in WHURLE using conditional translucion\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia\n  | pages = 163\u2013164\n  | publisher = \n  | year = 2001\n  | location = Aarhus, Danmark\n |display-authors=etal}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Nelson\n  | first = T.

Among his most celebrated tales are \"[[The Rats in the Walls]]\", \"[[The Call of Cthulhu]]\", ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', ''[[The Shadow over Innsmouth]]'', and ''[[The Shadow Out of Time]]'', all canonical to the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. Lovecraft was never able to support himself from earnings as an author and editor. He saw commercial success increasingly elude him in this latter period, partly because he lacked the confidence and drive to promote himself.

He was the only child of Winfield Scott Lovecraft (1853\u20131898) and Sarah Susan (Susie) Phillips Lovecraft (1857\u20131921).{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=16}} Though his employment is hard to discern, Lovecraft's future wife, [[Sonia Greene]], stated that Winfield was employed by [[Gorham Manufacturing Company]] as a traveling salesman.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=13}} Susie's family was of substantial means at the time of their marriage; her father, [[Whipple Van Buren Phillips]], being involved in many significant business ventures.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=8}} In April 1893, after a psychotic episode in a Chicago hotel, Winfield was committed to [[Butler Hospital]] in Providence. Though it is not clear who reported Winfield's prior behavior to the hospital, medical records indicate that he had been \"doing and saying strange things at times\" for a year before his commitment.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=26}} Winfield spent five years in Butler before dying in 1898. His death certificate listed the cause of death as [[general paresis of the insane|general paresis]], a term synonymous with late-stage [[syphilis]].{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=22}} Susie never exhibited symptoms of the disease, leading to questions regarding the intimacy of their relationship. In 1969, Sonia Greene ventured that Susie was a \"touch-me-not\" wife and that Winfield, being a traveling salesmen, \"took his sexual pleasures wherever he could find them\".{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=24}} How Greene came to this opinion is unknown, as she never met Lovecraft's parents, though Lovecraft himself termed his mother a \"touch-me-not\" in a 1937 letter noting that, after his early childhood, she avoided all physical contact with him.{{sfn|de Camp|1975|p=16}} This is contrary to Susie's treatment of a young Lovecraft soon after his father's breakdown. According to the accounts of family friends, Susie doted over the young Lovecraft to a fault, pampering him and never letting him out of her sight.{{sfn|de Camp|1975|p=2}} Throughout his life, Lovecraft maintained that his father fell into a paralytic state, due to insomnia and being overworked, and remained that way until his death. It is unknown if Lovecraft was simply kept ignorant of his father's illness or if his later remarks were intentionally misleading.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=26}}\n\nAfter his father's hospitalization, Lovecraft resided in the family home with his mother, his maternal aunts Lillian and Annie, and his maternal grandparents Whipple and Robie.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=28}} Lovecraft later recollected that after his father's illness his mother was \"permanently stricken with grief.\" Whipple became a father figure to Lovecraft in this time, Lovecraft noting that his grandfather became the \"centre of my entire universe.\" Whipple, who traveled often on business, maintained correspondence by letter with the young Lovecraft who, by the age of three, was already proficient at reading and writing. When home Whipple would share weird tales of his own invention and show Lovecraft objects of art he had acquired in his European travels. Lovecraft also credits Whipple with being instrumental in overcoming his fear of the dark when Whipple forced Lovecraft, at five years old, to walk through several darkened rooms in the family home.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=28}} It was in this period that Lovecraft was introduced to some of his earliest literary influences such as ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' illustrated by [[Dor\u00e9]], ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', a gift from his mother, [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Age of Fable]]'' and [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=33}}{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=36}}\n\nWhile there is no indication that Lovecraft was particularly close to his grandmother Robie, her death in 1896 had a profound effect. By his own account, it sent his family into \"a gloom from which it never fully recovered.\" His mother and aunts' wearing of black mourning dresses \"terrified\" him, and it is at this time that Lovecraft, approximately five and half years old, started having nightmares that would inform his later writing. Specifically, he began to have recurring nightmares of beings he termed \"night-gaunts\"; their appearance he credited to the influence of Dor\u00e9's illustrations, which would \"whirl me through space at a sickening rate of speed, the while fretting & impelling me with their detestable tridents.\" Thirty years later night gaunts would appear in Lovecraft's writing.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=34}}\n\nLovecraft's earliest known literary works began at age seven with poems restyling the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and other mythological stories.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=38}} Lovecraft has said that as a child he was enamored with the Roman pantheon of gods, accepting them as genuine expressions of divinity and foregoing his Christian upbringing. He recalls, at five years old, being told Santa Claus did not exist and retorting by asking why \"God is not equally a myth\".{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=42}} At the age of eight he took a keen interest in the sciences, particularly astronomy and chemistry. He also examined the anatomy books available to him in the family library, learning the specifics of human reproduction that had yet to be explained to him, and found that it \"virtually killed my interest in the subject.\"{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=60}} In 1902, according to Lovecraft's own correspondence, astronomy became a guiding influence on his world view. He began producing the periodical ''Rhode Island Journal of Astronomy'', of which 69 issues survive, using the [[hectograph]] printing method.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=84}} Lovecraft went in and out of elementary school repeatedly, oftentimes with home tutors making up for those lost school years, missing time due to health concerns that are not entirely clear. The written recollections of his peers described him as both withdrawn yet openly welcoming to anyone who shared his current fascination with astronomy, inviting anyone to look through the telescope he prized.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=90}}\n\nBy 1900 Whipple's various business concerns were suffering a downturn and slowly reducing his family's wealth. He was forced to let the family's hired servants go, leaving Lovecraft, Whipple and Susie, being the only unmarried sister, alone in the family home.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=97}} In the spring of 1904 Whipple's largest business venture suffered a catastrophic failure. Within months he died due to a stroke at age 70. After Whipple's death Susie was unable to support the upkeep of the expansive family home on what remained of the Phillips' estate. Later that year she was forced to move herself and her son to a small [[Duplex (building)|duplex]].{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=96}} Lovecraft has called this time one of the darkest of his life, remarking in a 1934 letter that he saw no point in living anymore.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=98}} In fall of the same year he started high school. Much like his earlier school years, Lovecraft was at times removed from school for long periods for what he termed \"near breakdowns\". He did say, though, that while having some conflicts with teachers, he enjoyed high school, becoming close with a small circle of friends.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=99}} Aside from a pause in 1904 he also resumed publishing the ''Rhode Island Journal of Astronomy'' as well as starting the ''Scientific Gazette'', which dealt mostly with chemistry.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=102}} It was also during this period that Lovecraft produced the first of the types of fiction he would later be known for, namely \"The Beast in the Cave\" and \"The Alchemist\".{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=116}}\n\nIt was in 1908, prior to his high school graduation, when Lovecraft suffered another health crisis of some sort, though this instance was seemingly more severe than any prior. The exact circumstances and causes remain unknown. The only direct records are Lovecraft's own later correspondence wherein he described it variously as a \"nervous collapse\" and \"a sort of breakdown\", in one letter blaming it on the stress of high school despite his enjoying it. In another letter concerning the events of 1908 he notes, \"I was and am prey to intense headaches, insomnia, and general nervous weakness which prevents my continuous application to any thing.\" Though Lovecraft maintained that he was to attend Brown University after high school, he never graduated and never attended school again. Whether Lovecraft suffered from a physical ailment, a mental one, or some combination thereof has never been determined. An account from a high school classmate described Lovecraft as exhibiting \"terrible tics\" and that at times \"he'd be sitting in his seat and he'd suddenly up and jump.\" Harry Brobst, who recorded the account and had a Ph.D. in psychology, claimed that [[Sydenham's chorea|chorea minor]] was the most likely cause of Lovecraft's childhood symptoms while noting that instances of chorea minor after adolescence are very rare.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=126}} Lovecraft himself acknowledged in letters that he suffered from bouts of chorea as a child.{{sfn|de Camp|1975|p=27}} Brobst further ventured that Lovecraft's 1908 breakdown was attributed to a \"hysteroid seizure\", a term that today usually denotes [[atypical depression]].{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=127}} In another letter concerning the events of 1908, Lovecraft stated that he \"could hardly bear to see or speak to anyone, & liked to shut out the world by pulling down dark shades & using artificial light.\"{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=128}}\n\n===Earliest recognition (1908\u20131914)===\nNot much of Lovecraft and Susie's activities from late 1908 to 1913 are recorded.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=128}} Lovecraft mentions a steady continuation of their financial decline highlighted by a failed business venture of his uncle that cost Susie a large portion of their dwindling wealth. Accounts differ on how reclusive Susie and Lovecraft were during this time. A friend of Susie, Clara Hess, recalled a visit during which Susie spoke continuously about Lovecraft being \"so hideous that he hid from everyone and did not like to walk upon the streets where people could gaze on him.\" Despite Hess' protest that this was not the case, Susie maintained this stance.{{sfn|de Camp|1975|p=66}} In the same account though, Hess said she regularly saw Susie out and about riding streetcars.{{sfn|Poole|2016|p=86}}\n\nFor his part, Lovecraft said he found his mother to be \"a positive marvel of consideration.\"{{sfn|de Camp|1975|p=64}} A next-door neighbor later pointed out that what others in the neighborhood often supposed were loud, nocturnal quarrels between mother and son, she recognized as being recitations of Shakespeare; an activity that seemed to delight mother and son.{{sfn|Poole|2016|p=82}} Susie had an adoration for [[French literature]], having studied French in boarding school. Lovecraft, though he never matched his mother's admiration of French literature, admired her knowledge and devotion to it.{{sfn|Poole|2016|p=84}} Lovecraft recalls Susie also had a passion for painting landscapes of the surrounding countryside, though none of her work survives today. One of Lovecraft's later friends, [[C. M. Eddy Jr.]], became aware of Lovecraft due to his wife Muriel, whose mother-in-law attended a [[women's suffrage]] meeting where she met Susie.{{sfn|Poole|2016|p=86}}\n\nDuring this period Lovecraft revived his earlier scientific periodicals.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=128}} He endeavored to commit himself to the study of [[organic chemistry]], Susie buying the expensive glass chemistry assemblage he wanted.{{sfn|Poole|2016|p=85}} Lovecraft found his studies were hobbled by the mathematics involved, which he found boring and would cause headaches that would incapacitate him for a day.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=129}} Lovecraft's first poem that was not self-published appeared in a local newspaper in 1912. Called \"Providence in 2000 A.D.\", the poem envisioned a future where proper people of English heritage were displaced by immigrants.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=137}} Surviving unpublished poems from this period, most notoriously \"On the Creation of Niggers\", were also emblematic of the xenophobia and racism inherent in much of Lovecraft's later work.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=138}}\n\nIn 1911 Lovecraft's letters to editors began appearing in pulp and weird fiction magazines, most notably ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]''.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=140}} A 1913 letter critical of [[Frederick J. Jackson|Fred Jackson]], a prominent writer for Argosy, started Lovecraft down a path that would greatly affect his life. Lovecraft described Jackson's stories as \"trivial, effeminate, and, in places, coarse.\" Continuing, Lovecraft said that Jackson's characters exhibit the \"delicate passions and emotions proper to negroes and anthropoid apes.\" This sparked a nearly year-long feud in the letters section of ''Argosy'' between Lovecraft, along with his occasional supporters, and the majority of readers critical of his view of Jackson. Lovecraft's biggest critic was John Russell, who often replied in verse, and to whom Lovecraft felt compelled to reply to because he respected Russell's writing skills.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=145}} The most immediate effect of the feud was the recognition garnered from [[Edward F. Daas]], then head editor of the [[United Amateur Press Association]]{{sfn|de Camp|1975|p=84}} (also known as the UAPA). Daas invited Russell and Lovecraft to the organization and both accepted, Lovecraft in April 1914.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=155}}\n\n===Rejuvenation and tragedy (1914\u20131921)===\n{{quote box|width=25%|align=left|quote=With the advent of United I obtained a renewed will to live; a renewed sense of existence as other than a superfluous weight; and found a sphere in which I could feel that my efforts were not wholly futile.

He contrasted this with his view of \"professional publication\", which he termed as writing for journals and publishers he considered respectable. He thought of amateur journalism as training and practice for a professional career.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=165}} Lovecraft was appointed to chairman of the Department of Public Criticism of the UAPA in late 1914.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=168}} He used this position to advocate for his, what many considered peculiar, insistence on the superiority of English language usage that most writers already considered archaic. Emblematic of the Anglophile opinions he maintained throughout his life, he openly criticized other UAPA contributors for their \"Americanisms\" and \"slang\". Often these criticisms were couched in xenophobic and racist arguments bemoaning the \"bastardization\" of the \"national language\" by immigrants.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=169}} In mid-1915 Lovecraft was elected to the position of first vice-president of the UAPA.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=180}} Two years later he was elected president and appointed other board members that mostly shared his view on the supremacy of classical English over modern American English.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=182}} Another significant event of this time was the beginning of [[World War I]]. Lovecraft published multiple criticisms of the US government's, and the American public's reluctance to join the war to protect England, which he viewed as America's homeland.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=210}}\n\nIn 1916 Lovecraft published his early short story \"The Alchemist\" in the main UAPA journal, a departure from his usual verse. Due in no small part to the encouragement of [[W. Paul Cook]], another UAPA member and future lifelong friend, Lovecraft began writing and publishing more fiction.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=237}} Soon to follow were \"The Tomb\" and \"Dagon\".{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=239}} \"The Tomb\", by Lovecraft's own admission, follows closely the style and construction of the writings of one of his largest influences, [[Edgar Allan Poe]].{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=240}} \"Dagon\" though, is considered Lovecraft's first work that embraced the concepts and themes that his writing would later be known for.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=251}} In 1918 Lovecraft's term as president of the UAPA elapsed, and he took his former post as chairman of the Department of Public Criticism.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=284}} In 1919 Lovecraft published another short story, \"Beyond the Wall of Sleep\".{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=260}}\n\nIn 1917 came two first hand accounts suggesting that, despite his climb in the ranks of the UAPA, Lovecraft still lived a fairly hermetical life. One comes from Cook himself, the other Rheinhart Kleiner, a Brooklyn-based UAPA writer.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=287}} Both recalled that during their visits Lovecraft's mother regularly checked in on Lovecraft. Kleiner mentioned that \"at every hour or so his mother appeared in the doorway with a glass of milk, and Lovecraft forthwith drank it.\"{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=288}} In the same account Kleiner described Susie as \"very cordial and even vivacious.\"{{sfn|Poole|2017|p=93}} Cook recounts an almost comical delay of his meeting with Lovecraft wherein Susie and Lillian would not let Cook in because Lovecraft had been up all night writing and could not be disturbed.{{sfn|Poole|2017|p=93}} Eventually Lovecraft appeared at the door in his \"dressing gown and slippers.\" Lovecraft later attributed his mother and aunt's reticence to allow Cook in being due to his unkempt appearance and their general dislike of Lovecraft's involvement with amateur journalism.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=287}}  Also in 1917, as Lovecraft related to Kleiner, was Lovecraft's aborted attempt to enlist in the army. Though he passed the physical exam,{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=303}} he told Kleiner that his mother \"has threatened to go to any lengths, legal or otherwise, if I do not reveal all the ills which unfit me for the army.\"{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=300}}\n\nIn the winter of 1918\u20131919, Susie, exhibiting symptoms of a \"nervous breakdown\" of some sort, went to live with her elder sister Lillian. It is unclear what Susie may have been suffering from. Clara Hess, interviewed decades later, recalled instances of Susie describing \"weird and fantastic creatures that rushed out from behind buildings and from corners at dark.\" In the same account Hess describes a time when they crossed paths in downtown Providence and Susie \"was excited and apparently did not know where she was.\" Whatever the causes, in March 1919 they resulted in Susie being committed to Butler Hospital, like her husband before her.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=301}} Lovecraft's immediate reaction to Susie's commitment was visceral, writing to Kleiner that, \"existence seems of little value,\" and that he wished \"it might terminate.\"{{sfn|Poole|2017|p=97}} Speaking to Susie's doctors, a month after she entered Butler, Lovecraft came to the realization that she was never going to be released.\n\nThe nature of Susie's illness is impossible to ascertain. Her medical records were lost in a fire, and the only Lovecraft researcher to have seen them prior was [[Winfield Townley Scott]]. His account describes Susie weeping often and speaking regularly about both her family's financial collapse and her son, whom she described as \"a poet of the highest order.\" Her psychiatrist claimed she had [[Oedipus complex]].{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=305}} The psychiatric views of the day, still beholden to archaic Victorian assumptions, make any contemporary diagnosis of Susie questionable. No matter their symptoms or situations, women were predominately diagnosed (as Susie was) with [[hysteria]], a concept that women are inherently mentally frail due to having \"thinner blood\" as a result of [[menstruation]] and having a [[uterus]].{{sfn|Poole|2017|p=83-84}} Lovecraft visited Susie often, walking the large grounds with her, and sent her letters on a regular basis.{{sfn|Poole|2017|p=97}}\n\nLate 1919 saw Lovecraft become more outgoing. After a period of isolation, he began joining friends in trips to writer gatherings, the first being a talk in Boston presented by [[Lord Dunsany]], whom Lovecraft recently discovered and idolized.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=306}} In early 1920, at an amateur writer convention, he met [[Frank Belknap Long]], who would end up being Lovecraft's most influential and closest confidant for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=308}} This period also proved to be the most prolific of Lovecraft's short-story career.{{sfn|de Camp|1975|p=142}} The influence of Dunsany is readily apparent in his 1919 output, later be to coined Lovecraft's Dream Cycle, with stories like \"The White Ship\", \"The Doom that Came to Sarnath\", and \"The Statement of Randolph Carter\". In early 1920 followed \"Celephais\" and \"The Cats of Ulthar\".{{sfn|Roland|2014|p=56}} It was later in 1920 that Lovecraft began publishing the earliest stories that fit into the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. The Cthulhu Mythos, a term coined by [[August Derleth]], encompasses Lovecraft's stories that share a commonality in fictional locations and Lovecraft's invented pantheon of god-like beings known as [[The Great Old Ones]].{{sfn|Roland|2014|p=69}} The poem \"Nyarlathotep\" and short story \"The Crawling Chaos\", in collaboration with Winifred Virginia Jackson, were written in late 1920.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=369}} Following in early 1921 came \"The Nameless City\", the first story that falls definitively within the Cthulhu Mythos.{{sfn|de Camp|1975|p=149}} In it is found one of Lovecraft's most enduring bits of writing, a couplet recited by his creation [[Abdul Alhazred]], \"That is not dead which can eternal lie; And with strange aeons even death may die.\"{{sfn|de Camp|1975|p=149}}\n\nOn May 24, 1921, Sarah Susan (Susie) Phillips Lovecraft died in Butler Hospital, due to complications from a gall bladder surgery five days earlier.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=390}} Lovecraft's initial reaction, expressed in a letter nine days after Susie's death, was that of an \"extreme nervous shock\" that crippled him physically and emotionally, again remarking that he found no reason he should continue living.{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=390}} Despite Lovecraft's immediate reaction to his mother's death, he continued to attend amateur journalist conventions. It was at one such convention in July that Lovecraft met [[Sonia Greene]].{{sfn|Joshi|2013|p=400}}\n\n===Marriage and New York===\nLovecraft's aunts disapproved of this relationship with Sonia.

Loveman was Jewish, but was unaware of Lovecraft's [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] attitudes.

Lovecraft made efforts to support his wife through regular jobs, but his lack of previous work experience meant he lacked proven marketable skills. After a few unsuccessful spells as a low-level clerk, his job-seeking became desultory. The publisher of ''Weird Tales'' attempted to put the loss-making magazine on a business footing and offered the job of editor to Lovecraft, who declined, citing his reluctance to relocate to Chicago; \"think of the tragedy of such a move for an aged antiquarian,\" the 34-year-old writer declared. Baird was replaced with [[Farnsworth Wright]], whose writing Lovecraft had criticized. Lovecraft's submissions were often rejected by Wright. (This may have been partially due to censorship guidelines imposed in the aftermath of a ''Weird Tales'' story that hinted at necrophilia, although after Lovecraft's death Wright accepted many of the stories he had originally rejected.)<ref name=\"JoshiSchultz2001\"/><ref name=\"Tyson2010\"/>\n\n===Brooklyn===\nGreene, moving where the work was, relocated to Cincinnati, and then to Cleveland; her employment required constant travel. Added to the daunting reality of failure in a city with a large immigrant population, Lovecraft's single-room apartment at 169 Clinton Street in [[Brooklyn Heights]], not far from the working-class waterfront neighborhood [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]], was burgled, leaving him with only the clothes he was wearing. In August 1925 he wrote \"[[The Horror at Red Hook]]\" and \"[[He (short story)|He]]\", in the latter of which the narrator says \"My coming to New York had been a mistake; for whereas I had looked for poignant wonder and inspiration \u2026  I had found instead only a sense of horror and oppression which threatened to master, paralyze, and annihilate me\". It was at around this time he wrote the outline for \"[[The Call of Cthulhu]]\", with its theme of the insignificance of all humanity. In the bibliographical study ''[[H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life]]'', [[Michel Houellebecq]] suggested that the misfortunes fed Lovecraft's central motivation as a writer, which he said was racial resentment.<ref name= \"ReferenceA\">{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Houellebecq | title = H.

He frequently revised work for other authors and did a large amount of [[ghost-writing]], including \"[[The Mound (short story)|The Mound]]\", \"Winged Death\", and \"The Diary of Alonzo Typer\". Client [[Harry Houdini]] was laudatory, and attempted to help Lovecraft by introducing him to the head of a newspaper syndicate. Plans for a further project were ended by Houdini's death.<ref>An H.P.

Affecting a calm indifference to the reception of his works, Lovecraft was in reality extremely sensitive to criticism and easily precipitated into withdrawal. He was known to give up trying to sell a story after it had been once rejected. Sometimes, as with ''The Shadow over Innsmouth'' (which included a rousing chase that supplied action) he wrote a story that might have been commercially viable, but did not try to sell it. Lovecraft even ignored interested publishers. He failed to reply when one inquired about any novel Lovecraft might have ready: although he had completed such a work, ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'', it was never typed up.<ref name=\"Anderson2014\">{{cite book|author=James Arthur Anderson|title=Out of the Shadows: A Structuralist Approach to Understanding the Fiction of H.

Subsequently, Lovecraft began to acquire the status of a cult writer in the [[counterculture]] of the 1960s, and reprints of his work proliferated.\nIn 2005 the status of classic American writer conferred by a [[Library of America]] edition was accorded to Lovecraft with the publication of ''Tales'', a collection of his weird fiction stories.<ref>LA Review of Books, April 6, 2013 [http://lareviewofbooks.org/review/lets-get-weird-on-graham-harmans-h-p-lovecraft Let's Get Weird]</ref>\n\n===Philosophical===\nPhilosopher [[Graham Harman]], seeing Lovecraft as having a unique\u2014though implicit\u2014anti-reductionalist [[ontology]], writes: \"No other writer is so perplexed by the gap between objects and the power of language to describe them, or between objects and the qualities they possess.\"<ref>Weird Realism: Lovecraft and Philosophy (2013) Graham Harman</ref>\nHarman said of leading figures at the initial [[speculative realism]] conference (which included philosophers [[Quentin Meillassoux]], [[Ray Brassier]], and [[Iain Hamilton Grant]]) that, though they shared no philosophical heroes, all were enthusiastic readers of Lovecraft.<ref>ASK/TELL, October 23, 2011 [http://eeevee2.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/interview-with-graham-harman.html Interview with Graham Harman]</ref> Speculative realists, [[Mark Fisher (theorist)|Mark Fisher]] and other contemporary philosophers, took Lovecraft seriously, mainly because Lovecraft's weird reality as presented in his novels, had nothing to do with the Gothic's insistence in the supernatural, but presented another reality incomprehensible to the human mind, but nonetheless real.

Human followers gave him a way to reveal information about their \"gods\" in a diluted form, and also made it possible for his protagonists to win paltry victories. Lovecraft, like his contemporaries, envisioned \"savages\" as closer to supernatural knowledge unknown to civilized man.\n\n===Inherited guilt===\nAnother recurring theme in Lovecraft's stories is the idea that descendants in a bloodline can never escape the stain of crimes committed by their forebears, at least if the crimes are atrocious enough. Descendants may be very far removed, both in place and in time (and, indeed, in [[culpability]]), from the act itself, and yet, they may be haunted by the revenant past, e.g. \"[[The Rats in the Walls]]\", \"[[The Lurking Fear]]\", \"[[Arthur Jermyn]]\", \"[[The Alchemist (short story)|The Alchemist]]\", ''[[The Shadow over Innsmouth]]'', \"[[The Doom that Came to Sarnath]]\" and ''[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward]]''.\n\n===Fate===\nOften in Lovecraft's works the protagonist is not in control of his own actions, or finds it impossible to change course. Many of his characters would be free from danger if they simply managed to run away; however, this possibility either never arises or is somehow curtailed by some outside force, such as in \"[[The Colour Out of Space]]\" and \"[[The Dreams in the Witch House]]\". Often his characters are subject to a compulsive influence from powerful malevolent or indifferent beings. As with the inevitability of one's ancestry, eventually even running away, or death itself, provides no safety (\"[[The Thing on the Doorstep]]\", \"[[The Outsider (short story)|The Outsider]]\", ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'', etc.). In some cases, this doom is manifest in the entirety of humanity, and no escape is possible (''[[The Shadow Out of Time]]'').\n\n===Civilization under threat===\nLovecraft was familiar with the work of the German conservative-revolutionary theorist [[Oswald Spengler]], whose pessimistic thesis of the decadence of the modern West formed a crucial element in Lovecraft's overall [[anti-modern]] worldview. Spenglerian imagery of cyclical decay is present in particular in ''At the Mountains of Madness''. S. T. Joshi, in ''H. P. Lovecraft: The Decline of the West'', places Spengler at the center of his discussion of Lovecraft's political and philosophical ideas.<ref>S. T. Joshi, ''H. P. Lovecraft: Decline of the West'', (Starmont Studies in Literary Criticism, No. 37), Borgo Pr, 1991, {{ISBN|978-1-55742-208-8}}.</ref>\n\nLovecraft wrote to Clark Ashton Smith in 1927: \"It is my belief, and was so long before Spengler put his seal of scholarly proof on it, that our mechanical and industrial age is one of frank [[decadence]]\".<ref>[[China Mi\u00e9ville]]'s introduction to \"At the Mountains of Madness\", Modern Library Classics, 2005</ref> Lovecraft was also acquainted with the writings of another German philosopher of decadence: [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Joshi|1996|p=38|ref=magick}}</ref>\n\nLovecraft frequently dealt with the idea of [[civilization]] struggling against dark, primitive barbarism. In some stories this struggle is at an individual level; many of his [[protagonist]]s are cultured, highly educated men who are gradually corrupted by some obscure and feared influence.\n\nIn such stories, the [[curse]] is often a hereditary one, either because of interbreeding with non-humans (e.g., \"[[Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family]]\" (1920), ''[[The Shadow over Innsmouth]]'' (1931)) or through direct magical influence (''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward''). Physical and mental degradation often come together; this theme of 'tainted blood' may represent concerns relating to Lovecraft's own family history, particularly the death of his father due to what Lovecraft must have suspected to be a [[syphilis|syphilitic]] disorder.\n\nIn other tales, an entire society is threatened by barbarism. Sometimes the barbarism comes as an external threat, with a civilized race destroyed in war (e.g., \"[[Polaris (short story)|Polaris]]\"). Sometimes, an isolated pocket of humanity falls into decadence and [[atavism]] of its own accord (e.g., \"[[The Lurking Fear]]\"). But most often, such stories involve a civilized culture being gradually undermined by a malevolent underclass influenced by inhuman forces.\n\nIt is likely that the \"[[Roaring Twenties]]\" left Lovecraft disillusioned as he was still obscure and struggling with the basic necessities of daily life, combined with seeing non-Western European immigrants in New York City.\n\n===Race, ethnicity, and class===\nRace is the most controversial aspect of Lovecraft's legacy, expressed in many disparaging remarks against the various non-Anglo-Saxon [[Race (classification of humans)|races]] and cultures in his work. As he grew older, his original Anglo-Saxon racial worldview softened into a classism or elitism which regarded the superior race to include all those self-ennobled through high culture. From the start, Lovecraft did not hold all [[white people]] in uniform high regard, but rather esteemed the English people and those of English descent.<ref name=\"joshimagic\">{{Cite book|title=A Subtler Magick: The Writings and Philosophy of H.

Lovecraft portrays this potential for a growing gap of man's understanding of the universe as a potential for horror, most notably in \"The Colour Out of Space\", where the inability of science to comprehend a contaminated meteorite leads to horror.\n\nIn a letter to [[James F. Morton]] in 1923, Lovecraft specifically pointed to [[Einstein]]'s [[Theory of relativity|theory on relativity]] as throwing the world into chaos and making the cosmos a jest; in a letter to Woodburn Harris in 1929, he speculated that technological comforts risk the collapse of science. Indeed, at a time when men viewed science as limitless and powerful, Lovecraft imagined alternative potential and fearful outcomes. In \"The Call of Cthulhu\", Lovecraft's characters encounter architecture which is \"abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours\".<ref>Lovecraft, \"The Call of Cthulhu\", p. 151.</ref> [[Non-Euclidean geometry]] is the mathematical language and background of Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]], and Lovecraft references it repeatedly in exploring alien [[archaeology]].\n\n===Religion===\nLovecraft's works are ruled by several distinct pantheons of deities (actually aliens worshiped as such by humans) who are either indifferent or actively hostile to humanity. Lovecraft's actual philosophy has been termed \"cosmic indifference\" and this is expressed in his fiction.<ref>Mosig, Yozan Dirk W. \"Lovecraft: The Dissonance Factor in imaginary Literature\" (1979).</ref> Several of Lovecraft's stories of the Old Ones (alien beings of the Cthulhu Mythos) propose alternate mythic human origins in contrast to those found in the [[creation myth|creation]] stories of existing religions, expanding on a natural world view. For instance, in Lovecraft's ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' it is proposed that humankind was actually created as a slave race by the Old Ones, and that life on Earth as we know it evolved from scientific experiments abandoned by the Elder Things. Protagonist characters in Lovecraft are usually educated men, citing scientific and rational evidence to support their non-faith. ''[[Herbert West\u2013Reanimator]]'' reflects on the [[atheism]] common in academic circles. In \"[[The Silver Key]]\", the character [[Randolph Carter]] loses the ability to dream and seeks solace in religion, specifically [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalism]], but does not find it and ultimately loses faith.\n\nLovecraft himself adopted the stance of atheism early in life. In 1932, he wrote in a letter to [[Robert E. Howard]]:\n\n<blockquote>All I say is that I think it is damned unlikely that anything like a central cosmic will, a spirit world, or an eternal survival of personality exist. They are the most preposterous and unjustified of all the guesses which can be made about the universe, and I am not enough of a hairsplitter to pretend that I don't regard them as arrant and negligible moonshine. In theory, I am an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], but pending the appearance of radical evidence I must be classed, practically and provisionally, as an atheist.<ref>H. P. Lovecraft Letter to Robert E. Howard (August 16, 1932), in ''Selected Letters 1932\u20131934'' (Sauk City, Wisconsin: Arkham House, 1976), p. 57.\"</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Superstition===\nIn 1926, famed [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] and [[Escapology|escapist]] [[Harry Houdini]] asked Lovecraft to ghostwrite a treatise exploring the topic of superstition. Houdini's unexpected death later that year halted the project, but ''[[The Cancer of Superstition]]'' was partially completed by Lovecraft along with collaborator [[C. M. Eddy Jr.]] A previously unknown manuscript of the work was discovered in 2016 in a collection owned by a magic shop. The book states \"all superstitious beliefs are relics of a common 'prehistoric ignorance' in humans,\" and goes on to explore various superstitious beliefs in different cultures and times.\"<ref name=\"Flood\">Alison Flood, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/16/hp-lovecraft-harry-houdini-manuscript-cancer-superstition-memorabilia Lost HP Lovecraft work commissioned by Houdini escapes shackles of history], The Guardian 16 March 2016.</ref>\n\n==Notable Recordings==\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] was the reader of \"The Outsider\" and \"The Hound\" on the 1966 album ''Roddy McDowall reads the Horror Stories of H. P. Lovecraft'' released by Lively Arts (Lively Arts 30003).\n* In the 1970's, [[Caedmon Audio|Caedmon Records]] released three albums of readings by noted actor [[David McCallum]]: ''The Rats in the Walls'' (1973; TC 1347), ''The Dunwich Horror'' (1976; TC 1467) and ''The Haunter of the Dark'' (1979; TC 1617).\n* In 1975, [[Erik Bauersfeld]] released audio productions of the Lovecraft stories \"The Outsider\" and \"The Rats in the Walls\" (both of which had been previously heard on his radio series ''[[The Black Mass]]'') in a limited and numbered pressing on Lava Mt.

Records (HPL 236) in 1977.\n\n==Influences==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2012}}\n\nSome of Lovecraft's work was inspired by his own nightmares.<ref>FRANCH, J., & MACROBERT, A. (2015).

''Sky & Telescope'', ''129''(2), 34-39.</ref> His interest started from his childhood days when his grandfather would tell him Gothic horror stories.\n\nLovecraft's most significant literary influence was Edgar Allan Poe. He had a British writing style due to his love of British literature. Like Lovecraft, Poe's work was out of step with the prevailing literary trends of his era. Both authors created distinctive, singular worlds of fantasy and employed [[archaism]]s in their writings. This influence can be found in such works as his novella ''[[The Shadow over Innsmouth]]''<ref name=\"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/soi.aspx |title=Lovecraft's Shadow Over Innsmouth |publisher=Donovan K.

Lovecraft was also influenced by authors such as Oswald Spengler and [[Robert W. Chambers]]. Chambers was the writer of ''[[The King in Yellow]]'', of whom Lovecraft wrote in a letter to [[Clark Ashton Smith]]: \"Chambers is like [[Rupert Hughes]] and a few other fallen Titans \u2013 equipped with the right brains and education but wholly out of the habit of using them\". Lovecraft's discovery of the stories of [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/10/30/cthulhus-evil-overlord-the-monstrous-world-of-hp-lovecraft/|title=Cthulhu's evil overlord: the monstrous world of HP Lovecraft|first=Ed|last=Power|date=October 30, 2016|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref> with their pantheon of mighty gods existing in dreamlike outer realms, moved his writing in a new direction, resulting in a series of imitative fantasies in a \"Dreamlands\" setting.\n\nLovecraft also cited [[Algernon Blackwood]] as an influence, quoting ''The Centaur'' in the head paragraph of \"[[The Call of Cthulhu]]\". He declared Blackwood's story \"[[The Willows (story)|The Willows]]\" to be the single best piece of weird fiction ever written.<ref>{{cite wikisource|wslink=Supernatural Horror in Literature |chapter=The Modern Masters |plaintitle=[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]] |last=Lovecraft |first=H.

His astronomical telescope is now housed in the rooms of the [[August Derleth]] Society.\n\nLovecraft's materialist views led him to espouse his philosophical views through his fiction; these philosophical views came to be called [[cosmicism]]. Cosmicism took on a dark tone with his creation of what is today often called the Cthulhu Mythos, a pantheon of alien extra-dimensional deities and horrors which predate humanity, and which are hinted at in eons-old myths and legends. The term \"Cthulhu Mythos\" was coined by Lovecraft's correspondent and fellow author, August Derleth, after Lovecraft's death; Lovecraft jocularly referred to his artificial mythology as \"Yog-Sothothery\".\n\nLovecraft considered himself a man best suited to the early 18th century. His writing style, especially in his many letters, owes much to [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] British writers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] like [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Jonathan Swift]].\n\nAmong the books found in his library (as evidenced in ''Lovecraft's Library'' by S. T. Joshi) was ''[[The Seven Who Were Hanged]]'' by [[Leonid Andreyev]] and ''[[A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder]]'' by [[James De Mille]].\n\nLovecraft's style has often been subject to criticism,<ref name=\"newstatesman.com\"/> yet scholars such as S. T. Joshi have shown that Lovecraft consciously utilized a variety of literary devices to form a unique style of his own \u2013 these include conscious [[archaism]], prose-poetic techniques combined with essay-form techniques, [[alliteration]], [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]], [[crescendo]], [[transferred epithet]], [[metaphor]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], and [[colloquialism]].\n\n==Influence on culture==\n[[File:H.

He did, however, correspond regularly with other contemporary writers such as Clark Ashton Smith and August Derleth,<ref>H.P. Lovecraft: Master of Weird Fiction. (2004). ''H.P. Lovecraft: Master of Weird Fiction'', 8-40.</ref> who became good friends of his, even though they never met in person. This group of writers became known as the \"Lovecraft Circle\", since their writing freely borrowed elements of Lovecraft's stories, with his encouragement: the mysterious books with disturbing names, the pantheon of ancient alien entities such as Cthulhu and Azathoth, and eldritch places such as the New England town of [[Arkham]] and its [[Miskatonic University]].\n\nAfter Lovecraft's death, the Lovecraft Circle carried on. August Derleth in particular added to and expanded on Lovecraft's vision, not without controversy. While Lovecraft considered his pantheon of alien gods a mere plot device, Derleth created an entire cosmology, complete with a war between the good [[Elder God (Cthulhu Mythos)|Elder Gods]] and the evil [[Outer God]]s, such as [[Cthulhu]] and his ilk. The forces of good were supposed to have won, locking Cthulhu and others up beneath the earth, in the ocean, and so forth. Derleth's Cthulhu Mythos stories went on to associate different gods with the traditional four [[Classical element|elements of fire, air, earth and water]] \u2014 an artificial constraint which required rationalizations on Derleth's part as Lovecraft himself never envisioned such a scheme.\n\nLovecraft's fiction has been grouped into three categories by some critics. While Lovecraft did not refer to these categories himself, he did once write: \"There are my 'Poe' pieces and my '[[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Dunsany]] pieces' \u2014 but alas \u2014 where are any Lovecraft pieces?\"<ref>Letter to Elizabeth Toldridge, March 8, 1929, quoted in ''Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos''</ref>\n* Macabre stories ({{circa}} 1905\u20131920);\n* [[Dream Cycle]] stories ({{circa}} 1920\u20131927);\n* [[Cthulhu Mythos|Cthulhu{{\\}}Lovecraft Mythos]] stories ({{circa}} 1925\u20131935).\n\nLovecraft's writing, particularly the so-called Cthulhu Mythos, has influenced fiction authors including modern horror and fantasy writers. [[Stephen King]], [[Ramsey Campbell]], [[Bentley Little]], [[Joe R. Lansdale]], [[Alan Moore]], [[Junji Ito]], [[F. Paul Wilson]], [[Brian Lumley]], [[Caitl\u00edn R. Kiernan]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[Neil Gaiman]], have cited Lovecraft as one of their primary influences. Beyond direct adaptation, Lovecraft and his stories have had a profound impact on popular culture. Some influence was direct, as he was a friend, inspiration, and correspondent to many of his contemporaries, such as August Derleth, Robert E.

An early version of [[Ray Bradbury]]'s \"The Exiles\"<ref>Published in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', Volume 1 No. 2 (Winter-Spring 1950), and later to become part of Bradbury's ''[[Martian Chronicles]]''</ref> uses Lovecraft as a character, who makes a brief, 600-word appearance eating ice cream in front of a fire and complaining about how cold he is. Lovecraft and some associates are included at length in [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and [[Robert Shea]]'s ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' (1975). Lovecraft makes an appearance as a rotting corpse in ''The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril'' by [[Paul Malmont]], a novel with fictionalized versions of a number of period writers. [[John Shirley]]'s story ''When Death Wakes Me To Myself'' offers a tale of a therapy patient slowly remembering a former incarnation when he was H.P. Lovecraft. German writer [[Wolfgang Hohlbein]] used H. P. Lovecraft as a main character in his [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] series ''Der Hexer'' (The Wizard), which is mainly based on the Cthulhu Mythos, even though the plot takes place before Lovecraft was born.\n\nOther notable works with Lovecraft as a character include [[Richard Lupoff]]'s ''Lovecraft's Book'' (1985), ''[[Cast a Deadly Spell]]'' (1991), ''[[H.P. Lovecraft's: Necronomicon]]'' (1993), ''[[Witch Hunt (1994 film)|Witch Hunt]]'' (1994), ''[[Out of Mind: The Stories of H. P. Lovecraft]]'' (1998), ''[[Stargate SG-1: Roswell]]'' (2007), and [[Alan Moore]]'s comic ''[[Providence (Avatar Press)|Providence]]'' (2015\u201317). Lovecraft also appears in the Season 6, Episode 21 episode \"Let it Bleed\" of the TV show ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''. A satirical version of Lovecraft named \"H. P. Hatecraft\" appeared as a recurring character on the [[Cartoon Network]] television series ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]''. A character based on Lovecraft also appears in the [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'', under the name \"Howard Phillips\" (or \"Mr. Howard\" to most of the main characters).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.

Azoulay]] suggests that Lovecraft was a fictional creation invented by [[Jorge Luis Borges]].<ref>[https://flapperhouse.com/2016/12/05/the-invention-of-h-p-lovecraft-fiction-by-shay-k-azoulay/ The Invention of H.

[[Penguin Classics]] has at present issued three volumes of Lovecraft's works: ''[[The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories]]'', ''[[The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories]]'', and most recently ''[[The Dreams in the Witch House and Other Weird Stories]]''. They collect the standard texts as edited by S. T. Joshi, most of which were available in the Arkham House editions, with the exception of the restored text of \"The Shadow Out of Time\" from ''The Dreams in the Witch House'', which had been previously released by small-press publisher [[Hippocampus Press]]. In 2005 the prestigious [[Library of America]] canonized Lovecraft with a volume of his stories edited by [[Peter Straub]], and Random House's [[Modern Library]] line have issued the \"definitive edition\" of Lovecraft's ''At the Mountains of Madness'' (also including \"[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]\").\n\nLovecraft's poetry is collected in ''The Ancient Track: The Complete Poetical Works of H. P. Lovecraft'' (Night Shade Books, 2001), while much of his juvenilia, various essays on philosophical, political and literary topics, antiquarian travelogues, and other things, can be found in ''Miscellaneous Writings'' (Arkham House, 1989). Lovecraft's essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\", first published in 1927, is a historical survey of horror literature available with endnotes as ''The Annotated Supernatural Horror in Literature''.\n\n===Letters===\nAlthough Lovecraft is known mostly for his works of [[weird fiction]], the bulk of his writing consists of voluminous letters about a variety of topics, from weird fiction and art criticism to politics and history. Lovecraft's biographer [[L. Sprague de Camp]] estimates that Lovecraft wrote 100,000 letters in his lifetime, a fifth of which are believed to survive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/letters/|title=Lovecraft's Letters|website=www.hplovecraft.com}}</ref>\n\nHe sometimes dated his letters 200 years before the current date, which would have put the writing back in US colonial times, before the [[American Revolution]] (a war that offended his Anglophilia). He explained that he thought that the 18th and 20th centuries were the \"best\", the former being a period of noble grace, and the latter a century of science.\n\nLovecraft was not an active letter-writer in youth. In 1931 he admitted: \"In youth I scarcely did any letter-writing&nbsp;\u2014 thanking anybody for a present was so much of an ordeal that I would rather have written a two hundred fifty-line pastoral or a twenty-page treatise on the rings of Saturn.\" (SL 3.369\u201370). The initial interest in letters stemmed from his correspondence with his cousin Phillips Gamwell but even more important was his involvement in the amateur journalism movement, which was initially responsible for the enormous number of letters Lovecraft produced.\n\nDespite his light letter-writing in youth, in later life his correspondence was so voluminous that it has been estimated that he may have written around 30,000 letters to various correspondents, a figure which places him second only to [[Voltaire]] as an epistolarian. Lovecraft's later correspondence is primarily to fellow weird fiction writers, rather than to the amateur journalist friends of his earlier years.\n\nLovecraft clearly states that his contact to numerous different people through letter-writing was one of the main factors in broadening his view of the world: \"I found myself opened up to dozens of points of view which would otherwise never have occurred to me. My understanding and sympathies were enlarged, and many of my social, political, and economic views were modified as a consequence of increased knowledge.\" (SL 4.389).\n\nToday there are five publishing houses that have released letters from Lovecraft, most prominently Arkham House with its five-volume edition ''Selected Letters'' (these volumes severely abridge the letters they contain). Other publishers are [[Hippocampus Press]] (''Letters to Alfred Galpin'' ''et al.''), [[Night Shade Books]] (''Mysteries of Time and Spirit: The Letters of H. P. Lovecraft and Donald Wandrei'' ''et al.''.), [[Necronomicon Press]] (''Letters to Samuel Loveman and Vincent Starrett'' et al.), and University of Tampa Press (''O Fortunate Floridian: H. P. Lovecraft's Letters to R. H. Barlow''). [[S. T. Joshi]] is supervising an ongoing series of volumes collecting Lovecraft's unabridged letters to particular correspondents.\n\n''Lord of a Visible World: An Autobiography in Letters'' was published in 2000, in which Lovecraft's letters are arranged according to themes, such as adolescence and travel.\n\n===Copyright===\nDespite several claims to the contrary, there is currently no evidence that any company or individual owns the copyright to any of Lovecraft's work, and it is generally accepted that it has passed into the public domain.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The H.

Lovecraft had specified that the young [[R. H. Barlow]] would serve as executor of his [[literary estate]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Joshi, Schultz|2001|p=16|ref=hplencyclopedia}}</ref> but these instructions were not incorporated into the will. Nevertheless, his surviving aunt carried out his expressed wishes, and Barlow was given charge of the massive and complex literary estate upon Lovecraft's death.\n\nBarlow deposited the bulk of the papers, including the voluminous correspondence, with the [[John Hay Library]], and attempted to organize and maintain Lovecraft's other writing. [[August Derleth]], an older and more established writer than Barlow, vied for control of the literary estate. One result of these conflicts was the legal confusion over who owned what copyrights.\n\nAll works published before 1923 are [[public domain]] in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ22.pdf|title=How to Investigate the Copyright Status of a Work- U.S. Copyright Office|author=|date=|website=copyright.gov}}</ref> With respect to works published later, ownership of the copyrights is disputed. Before the United States [[Copyright Act of 1976]], copyright lasted for 28 years from publication and a work that did not have its copyright renewed passed into the public domain. The [[Copyright Act of 1976]] retroactively extended this renewal period for all works to a period of 47 years<ref>[ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/law/copyright/faq/part2 Copyright Basics by Terry Carroll 1994]</ref> and the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] of 1998 added another 20 years to that, for a total of 95 years from publication. But everything turned on the renewal or expiration of copyright at the end of the first 28-year term.\n\nThe [[European Union]] [[Copyright Duration Directive]] of 1993 extended the copyrights to 70 years after the author's death. All of Lovecraft's works published during his lifetime became public domain in all 27 European Union countries on January 1, 2008. In those [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] countries that have implemented only the minimum copyright period, copyright expires 50 years after the author's death.\n\nLovecraft prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and part owners of Arkham House, August Derleth and [[Donald Wandrei]], often claimed copyrights over Lovecraft's works. On October 9, 1947, Derleth purchased all rights to ''Weird Tales''. However, since April 1926 at the latest, Lovecraft had reserved to himself all second printing rights to stories published in ''Weird Tales''. ''Weird Tales'' may only have owned the rights to at most six of Lovecraft's tales. Again, even if Derleth did obtain the copyrights to Lovecraft's tales, there is no evidence that the copyrights were renewed.<ref>{{cite web|last=William |first=Johns |title=Copyright |url=http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/copyrights.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003114117/http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/copyrights.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2003 |accessdate=September 17, 2013}}<!-- Keeping URL of copy on SourceForge.net as reference: http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/Innsmouth/LovecraftCopyright.html --></ref> Following Derleth's death in 1971, his attorney proclaimed that all of Lovecraft's literary material was part of the Derleth estate and that it would be \"protected to the fullest extent possible.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Karr |first=Chris J. |title=The Black Seas of Copyright: Arkham House Publishers and the H.P. Lovecraft Copyrights |url=http://www.aetherial.net/lovecraft/arkham.html#13 |accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\nS. T. Joshi concludes in his biography of Lovecraft that Derleth's claims are \"almost certainly fictitious\" and that most of Lovecraft's works published in the amateur press are most likely now in the public domain. The copyright for Lovecraft's works would have been inherited by the only surviving heir named in his 1912 will, his aunt Annie Gamwell. When Gamwell died in 1941, the copyrights passed to her remaining descendants, Ethel Phillips Morrish and Edna Lewis, who then signed a document, sometimes referred to as the Morrish-Lewis gift, permitting Arkham House to republish Lovecraft's works while retaining the copyrights for themselves. Searches of the [[Library of Congress]] have failed to find any evidence that these copyrights were renewed after the 28-year period, making it likely that these works are now in the public domain.\n\nChaosium, publishers of the ''Call of Cthulhu'' role-playing game, have a trademark on the phrase \"The Call of Cthulhu\" for use in game products. [[TSR, Inc.]], original publisher of the ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'' role-playing game, included a section on the Cthulhu Mythos in one of the game's earlier supplements, ''[[Deities & Demigods]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/literature/cthulhu5.htm|title=How Cthulhu Works|author=|date=September 4, 2007|website=howstuffworks.com}}</ref> (originally published in 1980 and later renamed to \"Legends & Lore\").

According to European tradition, they were first reported living east of the [[Volga River]], in an area that was part of [[Scythia]] at the time; the Huns' arrival is associated with the migration westward of a [[Scythians|Scythian]] people, the [[Alans]].{{sfn|Sinor|1990|pp=177\u2013203}} By 370 AD, the Huns had arrived on the Volga, and by 430 the Huns had established a vast, if short-lived, dominion in Europe.\n\nIn the 18th century, the French scholar [[Joseph de Guignes]] became the first to propose a link between the Huns and the [[Xiongnu]] people, who [[History of the Han Dynasty|were northern neighbours]] of [[China]] in the 3rd century BC.{{sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|2015|p=175, 180}}{{sfn|Grousset|1970}} Since Guignes' time, considerable scholarly effort has been devoted to investigating such a connection. However, there is no scholarly consensus on a direct connection between the dominant element of the Xiongnu and that of the Huns.{{sfn|Sinor|1990|pp=177\u2013203}} [[Priscus]], a 5th-century [[Eastern Roman Empire|Roman]] diplomat and historian, mentions that the Huns had a [[Hunnic language|language of their own]]; little of it has survived and scholars have considered whether it was related to [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], or even [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] language families, although the almost complete lack of a text corpus renders the language [[unclassified languages|unclassifiable]] at present. Some researchers indeed argue, the original Huns may have had a [[Yeniseian]] tribal elite, which ruled initially over various Turkic, Mongolic, and Iranian-speaking tribes.{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=29}} Numerous other ethnic groups were included under [[Attila|Attila the Hun]]'s rule, including very many speakers of [[Gothic language|Gothic]], which some modern scholars describe as a [[lingua franca]] of the Empire.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=228}} Their main military technique was [[mounted archery]].\n\nThe Huns may have stimulated the [[Migration Period|Great Migration]], a contributing factor in the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Ammianus|1939|loc=Ch. 2|ps=: However, the seed and origin of all the ruin and various disasters that the wrath of Mars aroused&nbsp;... we have found to be (the invasions of the Huns)}} They formed a unified empire under [[Attila|Attila the Hun]], who died in 453; after a defeat at the [[Battle of Nedao]] their empire disintegrated over the next 15 years. Their descendants, or successors with similar names, are recorded by neighbouring populations to the south, east and west as having occupied parts of [[Eastern Europe]] and Central Asia from about the 4th to 6th centuries. Variants of the Hun name are recorded in the Caucasus until the early 8th century. The memory of the Huns also lived on in various Christian [[hagiography|saints' lives]], where the Huns play the roles of antagonists, as well as in Germanic heroic legend, where the Huns are variously antagonists or allies to the Germanic main figures. In Hungary, a legend developed based on medieval chronicles that the [[Hungarians]], and the [[Sz\u00e9kely]] ethnic group in particular, are descended from the Huns. However, mainstream scholarship dismisses a close connection between the Hungarians and Huns.{{sfn|Sz\u0171cs|1999|p=xliv}}{{sfn|Engel|2002|p=2}}{{sfn|Lendvai|2003|p=7}}{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=386}}\n\n== Origin ==\n[[File:Eurasian steppe belt.jpg|thumb|The [[Eurasian Steppe]] Belt (in {{Colorsample|#AAEEFF}} on the map).]]\n\nThe Huns were \"a confederation of warrior bands\",{{attribution needed|date=March 2018}} ready to integrate other groups to increase their military power, in the [[Eurasian Steppe]] in the 4th to {{nobr|6th centuries AD}}.{{sfn|Pohl|1999|pp=501\u2013502}} Most aspects of their [[ethnogenesis]] (including their language and their links to other peoples of the steppes) are uncertain.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=502}}{{sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|2015|p=176}} [[Walter Pohl]] states: \"All we can say safely is that the name ''Huns'', in [[late antiquity]], described prestigious ruling groups of steppe warriors.\"{{sfn|Pohl|1999|p=502}}\n\n[[File:Hsiung-nu-Empire.png|thumb|left|Domain and influence of [[Xiongnu]] under [[Modu Chanyu]] around 205 BC, the believed place of Huns' origin.]]\n\nThe Roman historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], who completed his work of the history of the [[Roman Empire]] in the early 390s, recorded that the \"people of the {{nobr|Huns \u2026}} dwell beyond the [[Sea of Azov]] near the frozen ocean\".<ref name=Ammianus_Marcellinus_31.2_411>''Ammianus Marcellinus: The Later Roman Empire'' (31.2.), p. 411.</ref>{{sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|2015|p=177}} [[Jerome]] associated them with the [[Scythians]]  in a letter, written four years after the Huns invaded the empire's eastern provinces in 395.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=4}} The equation of the Huns with the Scythians, together with a general fear of the coming of the [[Antichrist]] in the late {{nobr|4th century}}, gave rise to their identification with [[Gog and Magog]] (whom [[Alexander the Great]] had shut off behind inaccessible mountains, according to a popular legend).{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|pp=2\u20134}} This demonization of the Huns is also reflected in [[Jordanes]]'s ''[[Getica]]'', written in the {{nobr|6th century}}, which portrayed them as a people descending from \"[[demon|unclean spirits]]\"<ref>''The Gothic History of Jordanes'' (24:121), p. 85.</ref> and expelled [[Goths|Gothic]] witches.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=5}}{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=209}}\n\nSince [[Joseph de Guignes]] in the {{nobr|18th century}}, modern historians have associated the Huns who appeared on the borders of Europe in the {{nobr|4th century AD}} with the [[Xiongnu]] who had invaded China from the territory of present-day [[Mongolia]] between the {{nobr|3rd century BC}} and the {{nobr|2nd century AD}}.{{sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|2015|p=175, 180}}{{sfn|Grousset|1970}} Due to the [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|devastating defeat by the Chinese Han dynasty]], the northern branch of the Xiongnu had retreated north-westward; their descendants may have migrated through [[Eurasia]] and consequently they may have some degree of cultural and genetic continuity with the Huns.{{sfn|Wright|2011|p=60}} [[Otto J.

Atwood rejects de la Vassiere's particular etymological interpretation because of the \"very poor phonological match\" between the three words.{{sfn|Atwood|2012|p=27}} He instead argues that because ''Xiongnu'' begins with a velar spirant and ''Huna'' with a glottal spirant, and that ''Xiongnu'' is a two-syllable word, but ''Xwn'' only has one syllable. However, Atwood agrees with the overall idenfitication between the two, showing instead that ''Xwn'' and Greek ''Kh\u014dnai'' comes via Chinese transcription of ''Hun\u00ed'', while Sanskrit ''Huna'' comes from the transcription of Chinese ''Xiongnu'' in the 2nd or 1st century BC due to the fact Sanskrit cannot render a velar spirant or a velar nasal. He argues it was ultimately transmitted from Sanskrit to Baktrian Greek, where it became ''Ounna'' (evidenced via John Malalas and the Chinese form ''W\u0113nn\u00e0sh\u0101'' in the ''Wei Shu''), as Greek cannot render a retroflex dental nasal like Sanskrit, becoming a coronal dental nasal. Likewise, he argues the glottal spirant was also lost in transcription to Baktrian Greek, since Greek tends to drop the glottal spirant, and instead became a glottal stop. Merchants then took it to the Kuban region, where it took the forms ''Ounnoi'' and ''Hunni'' in Roman Greek and Latin.{{sfn|Atwood|2012|p=28-48}} The Chinese ''[[Book of Wei]]'' also contain references to \"the remains of the descendants of the Xiongnu\" who lived in the region of the [[Altai Mountains]] in the early {{nobr|5th century AD}}.{{sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|2015|p=188}} According to De la Vaissi\u00e8re, the Central Asian and Chinese sources prove that the Hunnic nomadic group preserved their Xiongnu identity for centuries after their movement west.{{sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|2015|p=188}}\n\nBoth the Xiongnu and Huns used bronze cauldrons, similarly to all peoples of the steppes.{{sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|2015|p=187}} Based on the study and categorization of cauldrons from archaeological sites of the Eurasian Steppes, archaeologist Toshio Hayashi concludes that the spread of the cauldrons \"may indicate the route of migration of the Hunnic tribes\" from Mongolia to the northern region of Central Asia in the 2nd or {{nobr|3rd century AD}}, and from Central Asia towards Europe in the second half of the {{nobr|4th century}}, which also implies the Huns' association with the Xiongnu.{{sfn|Hayashi|2014|p=16}} This custom had already been practised in the Eurasian Steppes in the [[Bronze Age]] and in the early [[Iron Age]], but it disappeared around {{nobr|500 BC}}.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|J\u00e1nos|Sz\u0171cs|Szathm\u00e1ry|2014}} It again started to spread among the local inhabitants of the region of the [[Talas River]] and in the [[Pamir Mountains]] in the {{nobr|1st century BC}}.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|J\u00e1nos|Sz\u0171cs|Szathm\u00e1ry|2014}} In addition to the Huns, the custom is also evidenced among the [[Yuezhi]] and [[Alans]].{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=33, 39}} The lengthy pony-tail, which was a characteristic of the Xiongnu, was not documented among the Huns.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=146\u2013167}}\n\n[[File:Gold monster.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A gold stag with eagle's head, and ten further heads in the antlers.

As early as 380, a group of Huns was given Foederati status and allowed to settle in [[Pannonia]]. Hunnish mercenaries were also seen on several occasions in the succession struggles of the Eastern and Western Roman Empire during the late 4th century. However, it is most likely that these were individual mercenary bands, not a Hunnish kingdom.{{sfn|Sinor|1990|pp=177\u2013203}}\n\n[[File:Hunnish - Bracelet - Walters 571082 - Detail Front.jpg|thumb|Detail of Hunnish gold and garnet bracelet, 5th century, [[Walters Art Museum]]]]\n\n[[File:Hunnish - Fibula - Walters 57558.jpg|thumb|An Hunnish oval openwork fibula set with a carnelian and decorated with a geometric pattern of gold wire, 4th century, [[Walters Art Museum]]]]\n\nIn 395 the Huns began their first large-scale attack on the Eastern Roman Empire.{{sfn|Thompson|1948}} Huns attacked in Thrace, overran [[Armenia]], and pillaged [[Cappadocia]]. They entered parts of [[Syria]], threatened [[Antioch]], and swarmed through the province of [[Euphratesia]]. The forces of [[Theodosius I|Emperor Theodosius]] were fully committed in the west so the Huns moved unopposed until the end of 398 when the eunuch [[Eutropius (Byzantine official)|Eutropius]] gathered together a force composed of Romans and Goths and succeeded in restoring peace. It is uncertain though, whether or not Eutropius' forces defeated the Huns or whether the Huns left on their own. There is no record of a notable victory by Eutropius and there is evidence that the Hunnish forces were already leaving the area by the time he gathered his forces.{{sfn|Sinor|1990|pp=177\u2013203}}\n\nWhether put to flight by Eutropius, or leaving on their own, the Huns had left the Eastern Roman Empire by 398. After this, the Huns invaded the Sassanid Empire. This invasion was initially successful, coming close to the capital of the empire at [[Ctesiphon]]; however, they were defeated badly during the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] counterattack and retreated toward the [[Caucasus Mountains]] via the [[Derbent|Derbend Pass]].{{sfn|Sinor|1990|pp=177\u2013203}}\n\nDuring their brief diversion from the [[Eastern Roman]] Empire, the Huns appear to have threatened tribes further west, as evidenced by [[Radagaisus]]' entering Italy at the end of 405 and the [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossing of the Rhine into Gaul]] by [[Vandals]], [[Suebi|Sueves]], and Alans in 406.{{sfn|Thompson|1948}} The Huns do not then appear to have been a single force with a single ruler. Many Huns were employed as mercenaries by both East and West Romans and by the Goths. [[Uldin]], the first Hun known by name,{{sfn|Thompson|1948}} headed a group of Huns and Alans fighting against Radagaisus in defense of Italy. Uldin was also known for defeating Gothic rebels giving trouble to the East Romans around the Danube and beheading the Goth [[Gainas]] around 400\u2013401. Gainas' head was given to the East Romans for display in Constantinople in an apparent exchange of gifts.\n\nThe East Romans began to feel the pressure from Uldin's Huns again in 408. Uldin crossed the Danube and captured a fortress in [[Moesia]] named Castra Martis, which was betrayed from within. Uldin then proceeded to ransack Thrace. The East Romans tried to buy Uldin off, but his sum was too high so they instead bought off Uldin's subordinates. This resulted in many desertions from Uldin's group of Huns.\n\n[[Alaric I|Alaric's]] brother-in-law, [[Athaulf]], appears to have had Hun mercenaries in his employ south of the [[Julian Alps]] in 409. These were countered by another small band of Huns hired by [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius']] minister Olympius. Later in 409, the West Romans stationed ten thousand Huns in Italy and [[Dalmatia]] to fend off Alaric, who then abandoned plans to march on Rome, and in 433 some parts of [[Pannonia]] were ceded to them by [[Flavius Aetius]], the [[magister militum]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.sk/books?id=ST6TRNuWmHsC&pg=PA187&dq=huns++Pannonia+++Aetius++433&hl=cs&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjn396H-KjeAhXQzqQKHeCUCCwQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q=huns%20%20Pannonia%20%20%20Aetius%20%20433&f=false|title=The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia \u2013 Google Knihy |publisher=Books.google.cz |date=1990 |accessdate=2018-10-28 |isbn=0-521-24304-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Under Attila and Bleda ===\n\n[[File:Brogi, Carlo (1850-1925) - n. 8227 - Certosa di Pavia - Medaglione sullo zoccolo della facciata.jpg|thumb|left|A nineteenth century depiction of Attila.

Attila and Bleda were as ambitious as their uncle [[Rugila]]. In 435 they forced the Eastern Roman Empire to sign the [[Treaty of Margus]],{{sfn|Thompson|1999|p=136}} giving the Huns trade rights and an annual tribute from the Romans. The Romans also agreed to give up Hunnic refugees (individuals who could have threatened the brothers' grip on power) for execution. With their southern border protected by the terms of this treaty, the Huns could turn their full attention to the further subjugation of tribes to the west.\n\nWhen the Romans breached the treaty in 440, Attila and Bleda attacked Castra Constantias, a Roman fortress and marketplace on the banks of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Harvey|2003|p=15}} The Eastern Romans stopped delivery of the agreed tribute, and they broke other conditions of the Treaty of Margus. The Hunnic kings turned their attention back to the Eastern Romans. Reports that the Bishop of Margus had crossed into Hun lands and desecrated royal graves further angered the Hun kings. War broke out between the two empires, and the Huns overcame a weak [[Roman army]] to raze the cities of Margus, [[Singidunum]] and [[Viminacium]]. Although a truce was signed in 441, two years later [[Constantinople]] again failed to deliver the tribute and war resumed. In the following campaign, Hun armies came alarmingly close to Constantinople, sacking [[Sardica]], [[Arcadiopolis in Europa|Arcadiopolis]] and [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] along the way. Suffering a complete defeat at the [[Gallipoli|Battle of Chersonesus]], the Eastern Roman Emperor [[Theodosius II]] gave in to Hun demands and in autumn 443 signed the [[Peace of Anatolius]] with the two Hun kings. The Huns returned to their lands with a vast train full of plunder.\n\n=== Unified Empire under Attila<!--'Hunnic Empire' redirects here--> ===\n{{Infobox Former Country\n|conventional_long_name = Hunnic Empire\n|common_name = Hunnic Empire\n|continent = Europe\n|government_type = [[Tribe|Tribal]] [[Confederation]]\n|event_start = [[Balamber]] began uniting the Huns and Germanic tribes\n|year_start = 370s\n|event_end = [[Dengizich]], son of Attila, dies\n|year_end = 469\n|image_map = Huns empire.png \n|image_map_caption = The Hunnic Empire circa 450 CE\n|common_languages = [[Hunnic language|Hunnic]]<br>[[Gothic language|Gothic]]<br>Various tribal languages\n|leader1 = [[Balamber]]\n|year_leader1 = 370s\n|title_leader = [[List of Hunnic rulers|High King]]\n|leader2 = [[Attila]] and [[Bleda]]|year_leader2 = c. 435\u2013445|leader3 = Attila|year_leader3 = 445\u2013453|leader4 = Dengizich|year_leader4 = 453\u2013469|capital = |event1 = [[Attila]] and [[Bleda]] become co-rulers of the united tribes|event2 = Death of Bleda, Attila becomes sole ruler|event3 = [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]]|event4 = Invasion of northern Italy|event5 = [[Battle of Nedao]]|date_event1 = 437|date_event2 = 445|date_event3 = 451|date_event4 = 452|date_event5 = 454|event_pre = Huns appear north-west of the [[Caspian Sea]]|date_pre = pre 370s\n}}\n\nBleda died in 445, with some historians speculating that his death was at the hands of Attila. With his brother gone, Attila was able to establish undisputed control over his subjects. In 447, Attila turned the Huns back toward the Eastern Roman Empire once more. His invasion of the [[Balkans]] and Thrace was devastating. The Eastern Roman Empire was already beset by internal problems, such as famine and plague, as well as riots and a series of earthquakes in [[Constantinople]] itself. A last-minute rebuilding of its walls preserved Constantinople unscathed. Victory over a Roman army left the Huns virtually unchallenged in Eastern Roman lands and they raided as far south as [[Thermopylae]]. Only disease forced them to retreat, and the war came to an end in 449 with an agreement in which the Romans agreed to pay Attila an annual tribute of 2100 pounds of gold. Our only first-hand account of conditions among the Huns and of Attila himself is by [[Priscus]], an official in the peace embassy to Attila.\n\nThroughout their raids on the Eastern Roman Empire, the Huns had maintained good relations with the Western Empire, and in particular with [[Flavius Aetius]], a powerful Roman general (sometimes even referred to as the ''de facto ''ruler of the Western Empire) who in his youth had spent time as a hostage with the Huns. However, this all changed in 450 when [[Honoria]], sister of the Western Roman Emperor [[Valentinian III]], sent Attila a ring and requested his help to escape her betrothal to a senator. Attila claimed her as his bride and half the [[Western Roman Empire]] as dowry.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=251\u2013252}} Additionally, a dispute arose between Attila and Aetius about the rightful heir to a king of the [[Salian Franks]]. Finally, Attila's ability to distribute treasure to favoured followers was an important support to his power, and the repeated extortion from the Eastern Roman Empire had left it with little to plunder.\n\nIn 451, Attila's forces entered [[Gaul]], accumulating contingents from the [[Franks]], [[Goths]] and [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] tribes en route. Once in Gaul, the Huns first attacked [[Metz]], then his armies continued westwards, passing both Paris and [[Troyes]] to lay siege to [[Orl\u00e9ans]].\n\nAetius was given the duty of relieving Orl\u00e9ans by Emperor Valentinian III. Bolstered by Frankish and [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] troops (under [[Theodoric I|King Theodoric]]), Aetius' own Roman army met the Huns at the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]]. Although a tactical defeat for Attila, thwarting his invasion of Gaul and forcing his retreat back to non-Roman lands, the macrohistorical significance of the allied and Roman victory is a matter of debate.<ref>[[The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World|Creasy, Edward Shepherd: The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World]].</ref><ref>Norwich, ''Byzantium: the Early Centuries''. 1997, p. 158.</ref><ref>Bury, ''The Later Roman Empire'', pp. 294f.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ulpiano Checa La invasi\u00f3n de los b\u00e1rbaros.jpg|thumb|left|Invasion of the Huns approaching [[Rome]].]]\n\n[[File:Leoattila-Raphael.jpg|thumb|left|[[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]'s ''The Meeting between Leo the Great and Attila'' depicts [[Pope Leo I]], escorted by [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], meeting with the [[Hun]] emperor outside Rome]]\n\nThe following year, Attila renewed his claims to [[Honoria]] and territory in the Western Roman Empire. Leading his horde across the Alps and into Northern Italy, he sacked and razed the cities of [[Aquileia]], [[Vicetia]], [[Verona]], [[Brescia|Brixia]], [[Bergamum]] and [[Milan]]. Hoping to avoid the sack of Rome, Emperor Valentinian III sent three envoys, the high civilian officers Gennadius Avienus and Trigetius, as well as [[Pope Leo I]], who met Attila at [[Mincio]] in the vicinity of [[Mantua]], and obtained from him the promise that he would withdraw from Italy and negotiate peace with the emperor. [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] describes the historic meeting, giving all the credit of the successful negotiation to Leo. Priscus reports that superstitious fear of the fate of Alaric\u2014who died shortly after sacking Rome in 410\u2014gave him pause. More practically, Italy had suffered from a terrible famine in 451 and her crops were faring little better in 452;{{sfn|Soren|Soren|1999|p=472}} Attila's invasion of the plains of [[Northern Italy]] this year did not improve the harvest. To advance on Rome would have required supplies which were not available in Italy, and taking the city would not have improved Attila's supply situation. Secondly, an East Roman force had crossed the Danube and defeated the Huns who had been left behind by Attila to safeguard their home territories. Attila, hence, faced heavy human and natural pressures to retire from Italy before moving south of the [[River Po|Po]]. Attila retreated without Honoria or her dowry.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\n[[File:Maindron - Genevi\u00e8ve d\u00e9sarme Attila.jpg|thumb|left|Praying Sainte Genevieve disarm Attila - Sculpture by Etienne-Hippolyte Maindron (1857), exhibited in Notre-Dame church, Cholet, France]]\n\nThe new Eastern Roman Emperor [[Marcian]] then halted tribute payments. From the [[Pannonian Basin]], Attila planned to attack Constantinople. However, in 453 he married a girl with the Germanic name Ildico, and died of a haemorrhage on his wedding night.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=364}}\n\n=== After Attila ===\nAfter Attila's death in 453, the Hunnic Empire faced an internal power struggle between its vassalized Germanic peoples and the Hunnic ruling body. Led by [[Ellac|Ellak]], Attila's favored son and ruler of the [[Akatziri]], the Huns engaged the [[Gepids|Gepid]] king [[Ardaric]] at the [[Battle of Nedao]], who led a coalition of Germanic Peoples to overthrow Hunnic imperial authority. The [[Amali dynasty|Amali]] Goths would revolt the same year under [[Valamir]], allegedly defeating the Huns in a separate engagement.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Goths|last=Heather|first=Peter|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=1996|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=124}}</ref> However, this did not result in the complete collapse of Hunnic power in the Carpathian region, but did result in the loss of many of their Germanic vassals. At the same time, the Huns were also dealing with the arrival of more [[Oghur (tribe)|Oghur]] [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]] peoples from the East, including the [[Oghur (tribe)|Oghurs]], [[Saragurs]], [[Onogurs]], and the [[Sabirs]]. In 463, the Saragurs defeated the Akatziri, or Akatir Huns, and asserted dominance in the Pontic region.{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=123}}\n\nIn 458 some Huns served under [[Tudila]] in [[Majorian]]'s army, probably belonging to a group settled under [[Emnetzur]] and [[Ultzindur]] in [[Dacia Ripensis]].{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|pp=151, 161-162}} The western Huns under [[Dengizich|Dengzich]] were experiencing difficulties in 461, when they were defeated by Valamir in a war against the [[Sadages]], a people allied with the Huns.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Goths|last=Heather|first=Peter|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=1996|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=125}}</ref> His campaigning was also met with dissatisfaction from [[Ernak]], ruler of the Akatziri Huns, who wanted to focus on the incoming Oghur speaking peoples.{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=123}} In 465\u2013466, Ernak and Dengzich sent ambassadors to Constantinople requesting a peace treaty, and asking to establish a market for the exchange of needed provisions. However these requests were rejected, and Dengzich attacked the Romans in 467, without the assistance of Ernak. He was surrounded by the Romans and besieged, and came to an agreement that they would surrender if they were given land and his starving forces given food. During the negotiations, a Hun in service of the Romans named Chelchel persuaded the enemy Goths to attack their Hun overlords. The Romans, under their General [[Aspar]] and with the help of his [[bucellarii]], then attacked the quarreling Goths and Huns, defeating them.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|pp=165-168}}\n\nIn 469, [[Anagast]]es, the son of [[Arnegisclus]] who was slain by Attila, brought Dengzich's head and paraded it through the streets before mounting it on a stake in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]].{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=168}} Some Historians, like John Man, accept this date as the end of the Hunnic Empire.{{sfn|Man|2005|p=278}} However others, such as Kim, argue it continued under Ernak who absorbed the incoming Oghur speakers. These people were similar to the Huns and Attila's empire continued as the [[Kutrigurs|Kutrigur]] and [[Utigurs|Utigur]] Hunno-[[Bulgars]].{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=123}} This conclusion is still subject to some controversy. Some scholars also argue that another group identified in ancient sources as Huns, the [[North Caucasian Huns]], were genuine Huns who established a kingdom in modern [[Dagestan]] after being separated from the main group of Huns by the [[Sabirs]] around 506.{{sfn|Kim|2015|p=136}}{{sfn|Sinor|2005|p=4228}} Their kingdom lasted in this area for several centuries, possibly into the eleventh century as a subkingdom of the [[Khazar Khaganate]].{{sfn|Kim|2015|pp=136-137}}\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n=== Appearance ===\nAs the Huns were illiterate and thus kept no records, all surviving accounts were written by enemies of the Huns, and none describe the Huns as attractive either morally or in appearance. [[Jordanes]], a [[Goth]] writing in [[Italian Peninsula|Italy]] in 551, a century after the collapse of the Hunnic Empire, describes the Huns as a \"savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech.\"<ref name=\":6\" />{{rp|122|date=November 2012}} Jordanes goes on to write:<blockquote>They made their foes flee in horror because their swarthy aspect was fearful, and they had, if I may call it so, a sort of shapeless lump, not a head, with pin-holes rather than eyes. Their hardihood is evident in their wild appearance, and they are beings who are cruel to their children on the very day they are born. For they cut the cheeks of the males with a sword, so that before they receive the nourishment of milk they must learn to endure wounds. Hence they grow old beardless and their young men are without comeliness, because a face furrowed by the sword spoils by its scars the natural beauty of a beard. They are short in stature, quick in bodily movement, alert horsemen, broad shouldered, ready in the use of bow and arrow, and have firm-set necks which are ever erect in pride. Though they live in the form of men, they have the cruelty of wild beasts.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.romansonline.com/Src_Frame.asp?DocID=Gth_GOTH_24&Lat=|title=Who was Who in Roman Times: The Goths by Jordanes|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=4 February 2017}}</ref>{{rp|127\u20138|date=November 2012}}</blockquote>Jordanes also recounted how Priscus had described Attila the Hun, the Emperor of the Huns from 434\u2013453, as: \"Short of stature, with a broad chest and a large head; his eyes were small, his beard thin and sprinkled with grey; and he had a flat nose and tanned skin, showing evidence of his origin.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romansonline.com/Src_Frame.asp?DocID=Gth_Goth_35|title=Who was Who in Roman Times :The Goths by Jordanes|publisher=|accessdate=4 February 2017}}</ref>{{rp|182|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn forming their view of Attila's people, the Romans tapped into attitudes inherited from the Greeks, that these were the vilest creatures imaginable.

Denis Sinor, noting the paucity of anthropological evidence, wrote that \"there is no reason to question the basic accuracy of the western descriptions, and the absence of massive supporting evidence by physical anthropology cannot weaken the point they so tellingly make. It is the unusual that most attracts attention.\"{{sfn|Sinor|1990|pp=177\u2013203}} However, Austrian scholar Maenchen-Helfen wrote in the 20th century: <blockquote>Ammianus' description begins with a strange misunderstanding&nbsp;...

Peter Heather argues that the Huns were a disorganized confederation in which leaders acted completely independently and that eventually established a ranking hierarchy, much like Germanic societies.{{sfn|Heather|1999|p=11}} Thompson argues that permanent kingship only developed with the Huns invasion of Europe and the near constant warfare that followed.{{sfn|Thompson|1996|pp=67-68}} Kim, however, argues that the Huns continued the Xiongnu organization, in which their polity was divided into Left, Right, South, and North, in that order of priority.{{sfn|Kim|2013|pp=23, 207}} Kim argues that the Huns continued the council of \"six horns/nobles\" that the Xiongnu had under their emperor.{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=58-59, 208}}  Likewise, Kim suggests that the Huns continued to use the decimal military organization of the Xiongnu as well.{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=59}}\n\nAmmianus said that the Huns of his day had no kings, but rather that each group of Huns instead had a group of leading men for times of war (''primates'').<ref>Ammianus 31.2.4</ref> E.A. Thompson supposes that even in war the leading men had little actual power.{{sfn|Thompson|1996|p=50}} He further argues that they most likely did not acquire their position purely heriditarily.{{sfn|Thompson|1996|p=51}} Ammianus makes no mention of the Huns organization into tribes, but Priscus and other writers do, naming some of them.{{sfn|Thompson|1996|p=48}}\n\nPriscus calls Attila \"king\" (''\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u03c5\u03c2''), but it is unknown what native title he was translating:{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=190}} the terms Chanyu, Aniliki, Shah, and Yabgu are possible or interchangeable titles for the same position, as they were in use by other contemporary peoples during that period.{{sfn|Atwood|2012|p=33}}{{sfn|Kim|2013|pp=31, 59, 206}} Priscus also speaks of \"picked men\" or ''logades'' (''\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2'') forming part of Attila's government, naming five of them.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|pp=192-193}} Some of the \"picked men\" seem to have been chosen because of birth, others for reasons of merit.{{sfn|Thompson|1996|pp=179-181}} Thompson argued that these \"picked men\" \"were the hinge upon which the entire administration of the Hun empire turned\":{{sfn|Thompson|1996|p=183}} besides serving as ambassadors for Attila, he argued that each had command over detachments of the Hunnic army and ruled over specific portions of the Hunnic empire, where they were responsible also for collecting tribute and provisions.{{sfn|Thompson|1996|pp=181-183}} Maenchen-Helfen, however, argues that the word ''logades'' denotes simply prominent individuals and not a fixed rank with fixed duties.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|pp=194-195}} Kim affirms the importance of the ''logades'' for Hunnic administration, but notes that there were differences of rank between them, and suggests that it was more likely lower ranking officials who gathered taxes and tribute.{{sfn|Kim|2015|pp=83-84}} He suggests that various Roman defectors to the Huns may have worked in a sort of imperial bureaucracy.{{sfn|Kim|2015|p=85}}\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Further information|Hunnic language}}\nA variety of languages were spoken within the Hun Empire. Priscus noted that the [[Hunnic language]] differed from other languages spoken at Attila's court.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=377}} He recounts how Attila's [[jester]] [[Zerco]] made Attila's guests laugh also by the \"promiscuous jumble of words, Latin mixed with Hunnish and Gothic.\"{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=377}} Priscus said that Attila's \"[[Scythian]]\" subjects spoke \"besides their own barbarian tongues, either Hunnish, or Gothic, or, as many have dealings with the Western Romans, Latin; but not one of them easily speaks Greek, except captives from the Thracian or Illyrian frontier regions\".{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=382}}\n\nAncient sources record only three words as being in the language of the Huns: ''strava'' (funeral feast), ''medos'' (honey beer) and ''kamos'' (millet beer). All three words appear to derive from an [[Indo-European language]].{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|pp=423-426}}{{sfn|Pohl|1999|pp=501-502}}  The only other source on Hunnic language are personal and tribal names, with Maenchen-Helfen going so far as to say that \"[a]ll we know of the language of the Huns are names.\"{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=376}} Given this small corpus, many scholars hold the Hunnic language to be unclassifiable.{{sfn|Doerfer|1973|p=50}}{{sfn|Golden|2006|pp=136-137}}{{sfn|Sinor|2005|p=336}}{{sfn|R\u00f3na-Tas|1999|p=208}} However, the fact that many of the names and tribal ethnonyms used by the Huns can be given plausible Turkic etymologies has led scholars such as Maenchen-Helfen and Kim to argue that at least part of the Hunnic elite was Turkic speaking.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=441}}{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=30}} Others have cautiously followed their lead.{{sfn|Heather|1995|p=5}}{{sfn|Sinor|1990|p=202}} [[Omeljan Pritsak]] concluded from his own analysis of Hunnic personal names that Hunnic was a language \"between Turkic and Mongolian, probably closer to the former than the latter.\"{{sfn|Pristak|1982|p=470}}\n\nA number of scholars, especially in the former [[Soviet Union]], argued on the basis of the names that Hunnic was related to the [[Yeniseian languages]] of [[Siberia]].{{sfn|Vajda|2013|pp=4, 14, 48, 103\u20136, 108\u20139, 130\u20131, 135\u20136, 182, 204, 263, 286, 310}} Kim suggests that the Huns, whom he holds to be descended from the Xiongnu, experienced a language shift from Yeniseian to Turkic when they absorbed the [[Dingling]] and crossed into Central Asia on their way to Europe.{{sfn|Kim|2013|pp=29-30}}\n\nA number of surviving Hunnic names also appear to have Germanic origins.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|pp=386-389}}{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=329}} Partially on this basis, it has been supposed that by the 440s, the \"Huns\" were composed mostly of Germanic-speaking subjects rather than speakers of Hunnic, and as such [[Gothic language|Gothic]] may have been a ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Empire.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=254}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=142}}{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=329}} Kim disagrees with the notion that Gothic was a ''lingua franca'' and challenges some of the proposed Germanic names, arguing that there are \"more probable Turkic etymologies.\"{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=30}}  Both Kim and Maenchen-Helfen suggest that the Germanic names may have been Germanicized Turkic names or else second names kept in addition to a Turkic one.{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=30}}{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=389}}\n\nSubjects of the Huns also included [[Iranian languages|Iranian]]-speaking [[Alans]] and [[Sarmatians]].{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=146\u2013167}} Maenchen-Helfen finds that some Hunnic names have Iranian etymologies.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|pp=390-391}} He argues that these names were likely borrowed from the Persians and finds none prior to the fifth century; he takes this to mean that the Alans had little influence inside of Attila's empire.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=443}} Kim, however argues for a considerable presence of Iranian-speakers among the Huns.{{sfn|Kim|2015|p=4, 8}}\n\n===Religion===\nAlmost nothing is known about the religion of the Huns.{{sfn|Man|2005|p=61}}<ref>{{cite article|title=Christian Missionaries among the Huns|first=E.

The Huns brought large numbers of horses to use as replacements and to give the impression of a larger army on campaign.{{sfn|Dennis|1984|p=116}} The Hunnish peoples did not set up an entrenched camp, but spread out across the grazing fields according to clan, and guard their necessary horses until they began forming the battle line under the cover of early morning.

The Strategikon also states the Huns used deep formations with a dense and even front.{{sfn|Dennis|1984|p=117}}[[Otto J.

Illustration from the Hundeshagen Codex of the ''Nibelungenlied''.]]\nAfter the fall of the Hunnic Empire, various legends arose concerning the Huns. Among these are a number of Christian [[hagiography|hagiographic]] legends in which the Huns play a role. In an anonymous medieval biography of [[Pope Leo I]], Attila's march into Italy in 452 is stopped because, when he meets Leo outside Rome, the apostles [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] appear to him holding swords over his head and threatening to kill him unless he follows the pope's command to turn back.{{sfn|Eastman|2011|p=88}} In other versions, Attila takes the pope hostage and is forced by the saints to release him.{{sfn|Man|2005|p=291-292}} In the legend of [[Saint Ursula]], Ursula and her 11,000 holy virgins arrive at [[Cologne]] on their way back from a pilgrimage just as the Huns, under an unnamed prince,{{sfn|Man|2005|p=294}} are besieging the city. Ursula and her virgins killed by the Huns with arrows after they refuse the Huns' sexual advances. Afterwards, however, the souls of the slaughtered virgins form a heavenly army that drives away the Huns and saves Cologne.{{sfn|Montgomery|2010|pp=16-17}} Other cities with legends regarding the Huns and a saint include [[Orleans]], [[Troyes]], [[Dieuze]], [[Metz]], [[Modena]], and [[Reims]].{{sfn|Man|2005|pp=292-293}} In legends surrounding Saint [[Servatius of Tongeren]] dating to at least the eighth century, Servatius is said to have converted Attila and the Huns to Christianity, before they later became apostates and returned to their paganism.{{sfn|Heinric van Veldeken|2008|pp=110-111}}\n\nThe Huns also play an important role in medieval Germanic legends, which frequently convey versions of events from the [[migration period]] and were originally transmitted orally.{{sfn|Haymes|Samples|1996|pp=8-14}} Memories of the conflicts between the Goths and Huns in Eastern Europe appear to be maintained in the [[Old English]] poem ''[[Widsith]]'' as well as in Old Norse poem \"[[The Battle of the Goths and Huns]]\", which is transmitted in the thirteenth-century Icelandic ''[[Hervarar Saga]]''.{{sfn|Uecker|1972|pp=75-79}}{{sfn|Hedeager|2011|p=179}} ''Widsith'' also mentions Attila having been ruler of the Huns, placing him at the head of a list of various legendary and historical rulers and peoples and marking the Huns as the most famous.{{sfn|Hedeager|2011|p=187}} The name Attila, rendered in Old English as ''\u00c6tla'', was a given name in use in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[England]] (ex.

The Nibelung legend, particularly as recorded in the Old Norse ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and ''[[V\u00f6lsunga saga]]'', as well as in the German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', connects the Huns and Attila (and in the Norse tradition, Attila's death) to the destruction of the [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] kingdom on the Rhine in 437.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|pp=35-36}} In the legends about Dietrich von Bern, Attila and the Huns provide Dietrich with a refuge and suppport after he has been driven from his kingdom at Verona.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=99}} A version of the events of the Battle of Nadao may be perserved in a legend, transmitted in two differing versions in the Middle High German ''[[Die Rabenschlacht]]'' and Old Norse ''[[Thidrekssaga]]'', in which the sons of Attila fall in battle.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=99}} The legend of [[Walter of Aquitaine]], meanwhile, shows the Huns to receive child hostages as tribute from their subject peoples.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=72}} Generally, the continental Germanic traditions paint a more positive picture of Attila and the Huns than the Scandinavian sources, where the Huns appear in a distinctly negative light.{{sfn|Uecker|1972|p=63}}\n\nIn medieval German legend, the Huns were identified with the Hungarians, with their capital of ''Etzelburg'' (Attila-city) being identified with [[Esztergom]] or [[Buda]].{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|pp=79-80}} The Old Norse ''[[Thidrekssaga]]'', however, which is based on North German sources, locates ''Hunaland'' in northern Germany, with a capital at [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] in [[Westphalia]].{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=79}} In other Old Norse sources, the term Hun is sometimes applied indiscriminately to various people, particularly from south of Scandinavia.{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=79}}{{sfn|Haymes|Samples|1996|p=46}} From the thirteenth-century onward, the Middle High German word for Hun, ''hiune'', became a synonym for giant, and continued to be used in this meaning in the forms ''H\u00fcne'' and ''Heune'' into the modern era.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Jacob |last1=Grimm |first2=Wilhelm |last2=Grimm |title= Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch |year=1854-1961 |volume=10 |pages=1942 |publisher=Hirzel |location=Leipzig}}</ref> In this way, various prehistoric [[megalith|megalithic structures]], particularly in Northern Germany, came to be identified as ''H\u00fcnengr\u00e4ber'' (Hun graves) or ''H\u00fcnenbetten'' (Hun beds).<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Jacob |last1=Grimm |first2=Wilhelm |last2=Grimm |title= Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch |year=1854-1961 |volume=10 |pages=1943 |publisher=Hirzel |location=Leipzig}}</ref>{{sfn|Man|2005|p=298}}\n\n=== Links to the Hungarians ===\n\n[[File:Kurult\u00e1j - Magyar T\u00f6rzsi Gy\u0171l\u00e9s, Bugac, 2014.08.09 (1).JPG|thumb|Atilla \u2013 Kurult\u00e1j]]\n[[File:Magyar horsemen Kurult\u00e1j 2014.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Hungarian horsemen at Great Kurult\u00e1j 2014, the [[Hun]]-Turkic tribal assembly, [[Bugac]].]]\n\nBeginning in the High Middle Ages, Hungarian sources have claimed descent from or a close relationship between the Hungarians (Magyars) and the Huns.

The Magyars in fact originated from the Ugrian branch of the Finno-Ugrian peoples; in the course of their wanderings in the steppes of Eastern Europe they assimiliated a variety of (especially Iranian and different Turkic) cultural and ethnic elements, but they had neither genetic nor historical links to the Huns.{{sfn|Sz\u0171cs|1999|p=xliv}}</blockquote>\nGenerally, the proof of the relationship between the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and the [[Finno-Ugric]] languages in the nineteenth century is taken to have scientifically disproven the Hunnic origins of the Hungarians.{{sfn|Lafferton|2007|p=717}} Another claim, also derived from Simon of K\u00e9za,{{sfn|R\u00f3na-Tas|1999|p=436}} is that the Hungarian-speaking [[Sz\u00e9kely]] people of [[Transylvania]] are descended from Huns who fled to Transylvania after Attila's death and remained their until the Hungarian conquest of Pannonia.

Originally, the project's proposed title was ''Hammer Time'', both a play on the catchphrase made popular by artist [[MC Hammer]] and the name of the fictional fix-it show within the series, which was also called ''Hammer Time''. By the time [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] committed to the project in early 1991, Allen and his team had already changed the title to ''Home Improvement''. The show hosted by Tim Taylor in the [[shooting script]] for ''Home Improvement'' was still called ''Hammer Time'' when the first pilot with [[Frances Fisher]] was filmed in April 1991. The catalyst for the series' name change was to represent the aspect of fixing problems within the family and home life, as well as the use of mechanics and tools. Once the second phase of the pilot was produced, with all the actors that made the final cut into the series (including [[Patricia Richardson]]), Tim Taylor's ''Hammer Time'' became ''Tool Time''.\n\nThe first filmed pilot was produced in April 1991, with Frances Fisher playing Jill Taylor. Fisher, primarily known as a dramatic actress, was well qualified for the co-starring role but was viewed by the studio audience as not being comedic enough, and too serious in her line delivery. The producers tried to work with Fisher on adapting to the situation comedy setting, but shortly after the pilot wrapped post-production, they decided to recast her.\n\nBefore the first pilot was shot, actor [[John Bedford Lloyd]] was in the running for one of two roles; that of Tim's ''Tool Time'' assistant (originally named \"Glen\") and the role of Wilson. Bedford Lloyd eventually got the part of Wilson, but his agent later made claims that the actor was unaware that most of his scenes would require his face to be partially hidden behind a fence. For this reason, the crew received news just one day prior to taping the first pilot that Bedford-Lloyd had dropped out. Casting immediately contacted the other actor considered for the role, [[Earl Hindman]].\n\n[[Stephen Tobolowsky]] was tapped to play the ''Tool Time'' co-host, Glen. However, he was still busy with a movie that was in the middle of production at the time the first pilot was to be shot. Therefore, the producers set out to cast an alternate character that would stand in as Tim's co-host for the pilot, or for however many episodes were required until Tobolowsky was available. The casting department auditioned [[Richard Karn]], for what would be his first major appearance on a TV sitcom; the character of Al Borland was created from there. After the first few episodes completed with Patricia Richardson as Jill, Tobolowsky was still tied up with his other commitments, and Karn found himself in his role permanently when Tobolowsky decided he would have no time to do a series. Thus, the character of Glen never came into being.\n\n=== End of series ===\nThe series ended after eight seasons in 1999 due to a salary dispute between Allen and Richardson (Richardson was offered $25 million to do a ninth season; Allen was given double that). The two declined the offer and the series came to an end as a result.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/68477/14-sturdy-facts-about-home-improvement |title=14 Sturdy Facts About 'Home Improvement'|last=Cormier |first=Roger |publisher=Mental Floss |date=September 17, 2016 |access-date=September 21, 2018 |quote=Richardson was offered $25 million to do a ninth season; Allen was offered double that.

These guests included race car drivers [[Johnny Rutherford]], [[Robby Gordon]], [[Mario Andretti|Mario]] and [[Michael Andretti]], [[Al Unser]], Sr./[[Al Unser, Jr.|Jr.]]/[[Al Unser III|III]], actress and model [[Jenny McCarthy]] (the season 8 episode \"Young at Heart\"), country artist [[Alan Jackson]] (the season 5 episode \"When Harry Kept Delores\"), golfer [[Payne Stewart]] (the season 7 episode \"Futile Attraction\") and comedian [[Drew Carey]] (the season 6 episode \"Totally Tool Time\", although not playing himself).\n*Numerous [[NASA]] astronauts appeared on the series, the most notable being [[Ken Bowersox]], who made three separate appearances, once in the third season, once in the fifth and once in the seventh.\n*Former [[Denver Broncos]] [[quarterback]] [[John Elway]], then [[Detroit Pistons]] star [[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant Hill]] (the season 7 episode \"Believe It or Not\"), former boxers [[Evander Holyfield]] (the season 3 episode \"Eve of Construction\") and [[George Foreman]] (the season 1 episode \"[[List of Home Improvement episodes|Unchained Malady]]\"), and former President [[Jimmy Carter]] all appeared on the series. Carter made an appearance during season three episode \"[[List of Home Improvement episodes|Eve of Construction]]\", which focused on [[Habitat for Humanity]].\n*[[Isiah Thomas]] appears as himself at the end of the season three episode \"Aisle See You in My Dreams\".\n*[[Jay Leno]] appears with his car collection in the fourth-season episode \"[[List of Home Improvement episodes|Brother, Can You Spare a Hot Rod?]]\" In which he plays a staff member of \"Papa Mia\" the pizza guy. \"If he's not there in 30 minutes, you should have given better directions\" He also appeared four years later in the episode \"Home Alone\" in a dream sequence about Tim's book, saying \"Instead of getting a literary genius like Tim Taylor, we're stuck with [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Marlon Brando]].\" [[Leeza Gibbons]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]] also guest-starred in the episode playing themselves on their respective talk shows talking about Tim's book (and how he has not written it).\n*[[Bob Vila]] also appeared on several episodes, with Tim seeing him as a rival (he appears in Season One's \"What About Bob?\"  Season Two's \"The Great Race,\" Season Three's \"The Great Race II,\" Season Four's \"Tool Time After Dark,\" with recycled Tool Time footage from earlier episodes, and Season Six's \"Insult to Injury\" in a dream sequence about Vila winning the consecutive home renovation show appearance record; Vila wasn't played by himself, and instead played by a stunt-double for a one-shot cameo).\n*[[The Beach Boys]] appeared in the Season 6 episode \"[[List of Home Improvement episodes|The Karate Kid Returns]]\" as Wilson's cousins.  (Then-Beach Boys [[Carl Wilson]] and [[Mike Love]] were real-life cousins.)\n*[[Tom Wopat]], best known as Luke Duke from the TV Series ''The Dukes of Hazzard'', appears early on in Season 7 as Ian, to whom Jill feels romantically attracted after meeting him in a gym and who puts in granite countertops (albeit halfway) in the Taylor's kitchen.\n*A then-unknown [[Dave Chappelle]] and [[Jim Breuer]] guest-starred in the Season 4 episode \"[[List of Home Improvement episodes|Talk to Me]]\".  This episode set the stage for the ''Home Improvement'' spin-off ''[[Buddies (TV series)|Buddies]]'', which was Chappelle's first television series.  The series premiered in March 1996 and lasted five episodes, though 13 were produced.\n*Other famous guests include [[Drake Bell]] in the third-season episode \"Swing Time\", [[Jack Elam]], and [[Ernest Borgnine]], who both appeared in the first-season episode \"Birds of a Feather Flock to Taylor.\"\n*[[Dan Aykroyd]] makes a guest appearance as a blues-loving minister in the episode \"Losing My Religion\" during the seventh season, the character he was currently playing at the time in the series ''[[Soul Man (TV series)|Soul Man]]'', a series that was also created by the creators of ''Home Improvement'' that lasted two seasons. Aykroyd helps Tim understand Tim's son Randy's decision to no longer go to church after he starts volunteering at a hospice.\n*[[Robert Picardo]] made two appearances on the show as Tim's neighbor, Joe \"The Meat Man\" Morton. He appeared in \"A Sew, Sew Evening,\" and \"Blow-Up,\" both early on in the third season.  It was explained by Joe's wife Marie ([[Mariangela Pino]]) in the fifth-season episode \"Jill's Surprise Party\" that he had left her for a younger woman who worked at his plant (Picardo was no longer available after being cast as [[Doctor (Star Trek: Voyager)|The Doctor]] on ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'').\n*[[Rodney Dangerfield]] and [[Alex Rocco]] appeared together in the 1997 Thanksgiving episode in which they both appeared in a luxury box at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]].\n*Magicians [[Penn and Teller]] also appeared in one of the episodes of the final season, opening for Tool Time by performing tricks with Tim.\n*Actress [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] played Jessica Lutz, a girl that Brad was going on a date with in Season 4, three years before she became famous as Jen Lindley on the series ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''.\n*Jazz/crossover vocal group The Manhattan Transfer (Tim Hauser, Janis Siegel, Alan Paul, Cheryl Bentyne) appeared as themselves in season 2, an episode entitled \"I'm Scheming of a White Christmas.\"\n\n=== Casting changes ===\n\n==== Pamela Anderson ====\nIn the first two years of the show, [[Pamela Anderson]] played the part of Tim's Tool Girl, Lisa, on ''Tool Time'', but left the show to focus on her role on the syndicated series ''[[Baywatch]]''. Her last episode as a series regular was \"The Great Race\", which aired on May 19, 1993. Tim's new assistant, Heidi, played by [[Debbe Dunning]], replaced Anderson as the Tool Time Girl for the following third season, starting with \"Maybe Baby\", which aired on September 15, 1993. Anderson did reprise the role of Lisa on the sixth-season finale episode \"The Kiss and the Kiss-Off\", which aired on May 20, 1997.\n\n==== Departure of Jonathan Taylor Thomas ====\nIn the show's eighth season and final season, the middle child Randy left for an environmental study program in [[Costa Rica]] in the episode \"Adios\", which aired on September 29, 1998. This was done because [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] reportedly wanted to take time off to focus on academics. His last appearance on ''Home Improvement'' was the eighth and final season's Christmas episode \"Home for the Holidays\", which aired on December 8, 1998.  He did not return to the show for the series finale, aired in May 1999, only appearing in archived footage. He was shooting the film ''[[Speedway Junky]]'' for release that summer. His character was not replaced.\n\n== Plot details and storylines ==\n\n=== Taylor family ===\nThe series centers on the Taylor family, which consists of [[Tim Taylor (character)|Tim]] ([[Tim Allen]]), his wife Jill ([[Patricia Richardson]]) and their three children: the oldest child, Brad ([[Zachery Ty Bryan]]), the middle child, Randy ([[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]]) and youngest child, Mark ([[Taran Noah Smith]]). The Taylors live in suburban [[Detroit]], and have a neighbor named Wilson ([[Earl Hindman]]) who is often the go-to guy for solving the Taylors' problems.\n\nTim is a stereotypical American male, who loves [[power tools]], [[car]]s, and [[sport]]s. In particular, he is an avid fan of [[Sports in Detroit|local Detroit teams]]. In numerous instances, Tim wears [[Detroit Lions|Lions]], [[Detroit Pistons|Pistons]], [[Detroit Red Wings|Red Wings]], and [[Detroit Tigers|Tigers]] clothing, and many plots revolve around the teams. He is a former salesman for the fictional Binford Tool company, and is very much a cocky, overambitious, accident-prone [[know-it-all]]. Witty but flippant, Tim jokes around a lot, even at inappropriate times, much to the dismay of his wife. However, Tim can sometimes be serious when necessary. Jill, Tim's wife, is loving and sophisticated, but not exempt from dumb moves herself. In later seasons she returns to college to study psychology. Family life is boisterous for the Taylors with the two oldest children, Brad and Randy, tormenting the much younger Mark, all while continually testing and pestering each other. Such play happened especially throughout the first three seasons, and was revisited only occasionally until Jonathan Taylor Thomas left at the beginning of the eighth season. During the show's final season, Brad and Mark became much closer due to Randy's absence.\n\nBrad, popular and athletic, was often the moving factor, who engaged before thinking, a tendency which regularly landed him in trouble. Randy, a year younger, was the comedian of the pack, known for his quick-thinking, wisecracks, and smart mouth. He had more common sense than Brad but was not immune to trouble. Mark was somewhat of a [[Mother's boy|mama's boy]], though later in the series (in the seventh season) he grew into a teenage outcast who dressed in black clothing.  Meanwhile, Brad became interested in cars like his father and took up soccer. Randy joined the school drama club, and later the school newspaper; in the eighth season, he left for [[Costa Rica]].\n\nIn early seasons, Wilson was always seen standing on the other side of Tim's backyard fence as the two engaged in conversation, usually with Wilson offering sage advice as Tim grappled with his problems.  In later seasons, a [[running joke]] developed in which more and more creative means were used to prevent Wilson's face below the eyes from ever being seen by the audience.  Also in later seasons, Wilson's full name was revealed to be Wilson W. Wilson, Jr.\n\n=== ''Tool Time'' ===\nEach episode includes Tim's own Binford-sponsored home improvement show, called ''Tool Time'', a [[story within a story|show-within-a-show]]. In hosting this show, Tim is joined by his friend and mild-mannered assistant [[Al Borland]] ([[Richard Karn]]), and a \"Tool Time girl\"\u2014first Lisa ([[Pamela Anderson]]) and later Heidi ([[Debbe Dunning]])\u2014whose main duty is to introduce the pair at the beginning of the show with the line \"Does everybody know what time it is?\". In reply, the audience yells, \"TOOL TIME!\" The Tool Time girl also assists Tim and Al during the show by bringing them tools.\n\nAlthough revealed to be an excellent salesman and TV personality, Tim is spectacularly accident prone as a handyman, often causing massive disasters on and off the set, to the consternation of his co-workers and family. Many ''Tool Time'' viewers assume that the accidents on the show are done on purpose, to demonstrate the consequences of using tools improperly. Many of Tim's accidents are caused by his devices being used in an unorthodox or overpowered manner, designed to illustrate his mantra \"More power!\". This popular catchphrase would not be uttered after ''Home Improvement''{{'}}s seventh season,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatedisney.com/homeimprovement-season3.html|title=\"Home Improvement\" The Complete Third Season DVD Review \u2013 Page 1 of 2|work=ultimatedisney.com}}</ref> until Tim's last line in the series finale, which are the last two words ever spoken.\n\n''Tool Time'' was conceived as a parody of the PBS home-improvement show ''[[This Old House]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Home Improvement |url=http://www.timallen.com/actor/tv_home_improvement.php?xpt=1|website=TimAllen.com|quote=Tim originally envisioned the show as This Old House combined with a Myrna Loy-type wife to a William Powell-type husband from \"The Thin Man\" movies from the forties.}}</ref>  Tim and Al are caricatures of the two principal cast members of ''This Old House'', host [[Bob Vila]] and master carpenter [[Norm Abram]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Storrs|first1=Francis|title=This Old House: An Oral History|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/2009/01/this-old-house/|work=Boston Magazine|date=February 2009|quote=Vila: The Disney people contacted me before Home Improvement premiered.

The theme song is unique for its sampling of [[power tool]]s, most notably an [[electric drill]] and [[jackhammer]], which is heard during theme song. Tim's grunting was also sampled for the theme song. The [[flute]] and [[organ (music)|organ]] parts of the theme music were also used. From Season 7 until the end of the series, a remixed version of the theme song was used.\n\n== Awards, nominations, and other reception ==\n{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Home Improvement}}\n''Home Improvement'' received numerous awards and nominations in its 8-season run. Notable awards and nominations include: [[Golden Globe Award]]s, [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Kids' Choice Awards]], Young Artist Awards, YoungStar Awards, [[ASCAP Award]], and many others.\n\n[[WatchMojo.com]] ranked Home Improvement as the #9 TV sitcom from the 1990s. The character with most honors was Wilson, who was ranked as the #6 unseen TV character and as the #3 TV neighbor. Binford made it to the #10 fictional brand. The video game ''[[Home Improvement: Power Tool Pursuit]]!'' was ranked as the #5 worst game based on a TV series. On Metacritic, the first season holds a score of 64 out of 100, based on 18 critics and the second season holds a score of 75 out of 100, based on 5 critics, both indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n== Michigan college and university apparel ==\nThroughout the show, Tim Taylor would often be wearing sweatshirts or T-shirts from various Michigan-based colleges and universities. These were usually sent by the schools to the show for him to wear during an episode.<ref>{{cite web|title=Home Improvement|url=http://www.timallen.com/actor/tv_home_improvement.php?xpt=1|website=TimAllen.com|quote=Colleges and universities in Michigan sent Tim sweaters and T-shirts to wear on the air, and he did..}}</ref> Because Allen considered Michigan his home state, the rule was that only Michigan schools would get the free advertising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.directexpose.com/home-improvement-didnt-know/12/|title=Bet You Didn't Know This About Home Improvement! - DirectExpose|publisher=}}</ref> There were two notable exceptions to the general rule that Tim only supported Michigan educational institutions on the show.

The Silures were led by [[Caratacus]], and he carried out an effective [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla attack]]  campaign against Governor [[Publius Ostorius Scapula]]. Finally, in 51, Ostorius lured Caratacus into a set-piece battle and defeated him. The British leader sought refuge among the Brigantes, but their queen, [[Cartimandua]], proved her loyalty by surrendering him to the Romans. He was brought as a captive to Rome, where a dignified speech he made during Claudius's triumph persuaded the emperor to spare his life. The Silures were still not pacified, and Cartimandua's ex-husband [[Venutius]] replaced Caratacus as the most prominent leader of British resistance.<ref>{{citation |author=Tacitus |title=Annals |at=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+12.31 12:31\u201338] }}</ref>\n\nIn 60\u201361, while Governor [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]] was campaigning in Wales, the southeast of Britain rose in revolt under the leadership of [[Boudica]]. Boudica was the widow of the recently deceased king of the Iceni, Prasutagus. The Roman historian Tacitus reports that Prasutagus had left a will leaving half his kingdom to [[Nero]] in the hope that the remainder would be left untouched. He was wrong. When his will was enforced, Rome responded by violently seizing the tribe's lands in full. Boudica protested. In consequence, Rome punished her and her daughters by flogging and rape. In response, the Iceni, joined by the [[Trinovantes]], destroyed the Roman colony at Camulodunum ([[Colchester]]) and routed the part of the IXth Legion that was sent to relieve it. Suetonius Paulinus rode to [[London]] (then called [[Londinium]]), the rebels' next target, but concluded it could not be defended. Abandoned, it was destroyed, as was [[Verulamium]] (St. Albans). Between seventy and eighty thousand people are said to have been killed in the three cities. But Suetonius regrouped with two of the three legions still available to him, chose a battlefield, and, despite being heavily outnumbered, defeated the rebels in the [[Battle of Watling Street]].

As civil war raged in Rome, weak governors were unable to control the legions in Britain, and Venutius of the Brigantes seized his chance. The Romans had previously defended Cartimandua against him, but this time were unable to do so. Cartimandua was evacuated, and Venutius was left in control of the north of the country.

Governor [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], father-in-law to the historian [[Tacitus]], conquered the [[Ordovices]] in 78.

Roman coins and pottery have been found circulating at native settlement sites in the [[Scottish Lowlands]] in the years before 100, indicating growing [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]]. Some of the most important sources for this era are the writing tablets from the fort at [[Vindolanda]] in [[Northumberland]], mostly dating to 90\u2013110. These tablets provide vivid evidence for the operation of a Roman fort at the edge of the Roman Empire, where officers' wives maintained polite society while merchants, hauliers and military personnel kept the fort operational and supplied.\n\nAround 105 there appears to have been a serious setback at the hands of the tribes of the [[Picts]] of [[Alba]]: several Roman forts were destroyed by fire, with human remains and damaged [[armour]] at ''[[Trimontium (Newstead)|Trimontium]]'' (at modern [[Newstead, Scottish Borders|Newstead]], in SE Scotland) indicating hostilities at least at that site. There is also circumstantial evidence that auxiliary reinforcements were sent from Germany, and an unnamed British war of the period is mentioned on the gravestone of a [[tribune]] of [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]]. [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]] may have led to troop reductions in the area or even total withdrawal followed by slighting of the forts by the Picts rather than an unrecorded military defeat. The Romans were also in the habit of destroying their own forts during an orderly withdrawal, in order to deny resources to an enemy. In either case, the frontier probably moved south to the line of the [[Stanegate]] at the [[Solway Firth|Solway]]\u2013[[River Tyne|Tyne]] isthmus around this time.\n\n[[File:Hadrians Wall from Housesteads1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hadrian's Wall]] viewed from [[Vercovicium]]]]\n[[File:Prima Europe tabula.jpg|thumb|left|''Prima Europe tabula''. A 1486 copy of [[Ptolemy]]'s 2nd-century map of Roman Britain]]\nA new crisis occurred at the beginning of [[Hadrian]]'s reign (117): a rising in the north which was suppressed by [[Quintus Pompeius Falco]]. When Hadrian reached Britannia on his famous tour of the Roman provinces around 120, he directed an extensive defensive wall, known to posterity as [[Hadrian's Wall]], to be built close to the line of the Stanegate frontier. Hadrian appointed [[Aulus Platorius Nepos]] as governor to undertake this work who brought the ''{{lang|la|[[Legio VI Victrix]]}}'' legion with him from ''{{lang|la|[[Germania Inferior]]}}''. This replaced the famous ''{{lang|la|[[Legio IX Hispana]]}}'', whose disappearance has been much discussed. Archaeology indicates considerable political instability in Scotland during the first half of the 2nd century, and the shifting frontier at this time should be seen in this context.\n\nIn the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]] (138\u2013161) the Hadrianic border was briefly extended north to the Forth\u2013Clyde isthmus, where the [[Antonine Wall]] was built around 142 following the military reoccupation of the Scottish lowlands by a new governor, [[Quintus Lollius Urbicus]].\n\nThe first Antonine occupation of Scotland ended as a result of a further crisis in 155\u2013157, when the [[Brigantes]] revolted. With limited options to despatch reinforcements, the Romans moved their troops south, and this rising was suppressed by Governor [[Gnaeus Julius Verus]]. Within a year the Antonine Wall was recaptured, but by 163 or 164 it was abandoned. The second occupation was probably connected with Antoninus's undertakings to protect the Votadini or his pride in enlarging the empire, since the retreat to the Hadrianic frontier occurred not long after his death when a more objective strategic assessment of the benefits of the Antonine Wall could be made. The Romans did not entirely withdraw from Scotland at this time: the large fort at Newstead was maintained along with seven smaller outposts until at least 180.\n\nDuring the twenty-year period following the reversion of the frontier to Hadrian's Wall, Rome was concerned with continental issues, primarily [[marcomannic Wars|problems]] in the [[Danube|Danubian]] provinces. Increasing numbers of [[hoard]]s of buried coins in Britain at this time indicate that peace was not entirely achieved. Sufficient Roman silver has been found in Scotland to suggest more than ordinary trade, and it is likely that the Romans were reinforcing [[treaty]] agreements by paying tribute to their implacable enemies, the Picts.\n\nIn 175, a large force of [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] cavalry, consisting of 5,500 men, arrived in Britannia, probably to reinforce troops fighting unrecorded uprisings. In 180, Hadrian's Wall was breached by the Picts and the commanding officer or governor was killed there in what [[Cassius Dio]] described as the most serious war of the reign of [[Commodus]]. [[Ulpius Marcellus]] was sent as replacement governor and by 184 he had won a new peace, only to be faced with a mutiny from his own troops. Unhappy with Marcellus's strictness, they tried to elect a legate named [[Caerellius Priscus|Priscus]] as usurper governor; he refused, but Marcellus was lucky to leave the province alive. The Roman army in Britannia continued its insubordination: they sent a delegation of 1,500 to Rome to demand the execution of [[Tigidius Perennis]], a [[Praetorian prefect]] who they felt had earlier wronged them by posting lowly [[equites]] to legate ranks in Britannia. Commodus met the party outside Rome and agreed to have Perennis killed, but this only made them feel more secure in their mutiny.\n\nThe future emperor [[Pertinax]] was sent to Britannia to quell the mutiny and was initially successful in regaining control, but a riot broke out among the troops. Pertinax was attacked and left for dead, and asked to be recalled to Rome, where he briefly succeeded Commodus as emperor in 192.\n\n=== 3rd century ===\nThe death of Commodus put into motion a series of events which eventually led to civil war. Following the short reign of Pertinax, several rivals for the emperorship emerged, including [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Clodius Albinus]]. The latter was the new governor of Britannia, and had seemingly won the natives over after their earlier rebellions; he also controlled three legions, making him a potentially significant claimant. His sometime rival Severus promised him the title of ''Caesar'' in return for Albinus's support against [[Pescennius Niger]] in the east. Once Niger was neutralised, Severus turned on his ally in Britannia&nbsp;\u2014 it is likely that Albinus saw he would be the next target and was already preparing for war.\n\nAlbinus crossed to [[Gaul]] in 195, where the provinces were also sympathetic to him, and set up at [[Lugdunum]]. Severus arrived in February 196, and the ensuing battle was decisive. Albinus came close to victory, but Severus's reinforcements won the day, and the British governor committed suicide. Severus soon purged Albinus's sympathisers and perhaps confiscated large tracts of land in Britain as punishment.\n\nAlbinus had demonstrated the major problem posed by Roman Britain. In order to maintain security, the province required the presence of three legions; but command of these forces provided an ideal power base for ambitious rivals. Deploying those legions elsewhere would strip the island of its garrison, leaving the province defenceless against uprisings by the native Celtic tribes and against invasion by the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels|Scots]].\n\nThe traditional view is that northern Britain descended into anarchy during Albinus's absence. Cassius Dio records that the new Governor, [[Virius Lupus]], was obliged to buy peace from a fractious northern tribe known as the [[Maeatae]]. The succession of militarily distinguished governors who were subsequently appointed suggests that enemies of Rome were posing a difficult challenge, and [[Lucius Alfenus Senecio]]'s report to Rome in 207 describes barbarians \"rebelling, over-running the land, taking loot and creating destruction\". In order to rebel, of course, one must be a subject&nbsp;\u2014 the Maeatae clearly did not consider themselves such. Senecio requested either reinforcements or an Imperial expedition, and Severus chose the latter, despite being 62 years old.\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that Senecio had been rebuilding the defences of Hadrian's Wall and the forts beyond it, and Severus's arrival in Britain prompted the enemy tribes to sue for peace immediately. The emperor had not come all that way to leave without a victory, and it is likely that he wished to provide his teenage sons [[Caracalla]] and [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] with first-hand experience of controlling a hostile barbarian land.\n[[File:Roman.Britain.Severan.Campaigns.jpg|thumb|Northern campaigns, 208\u2013211]]\nAn [[Roman invasion of Caledonia 208\u2013210|invasion of Caledonia]] led by Severus and probably numbering around 20,000 troops moved north in 208 or 209, crossing the Wall and passing through eastern Scotland on a route similar to that used by Agricola. Harried by punishing guerrilla raids by the northern tribes and slowed by an unforgiving terrain, Severus was unable to meet the Caledonians on a battlefield. The emperor's forces pushed north as far as the [[River Tay]], but little appears to have been achieved by the invasion, as peace treaties were signed with the Caledonians. By 210 Severus had returned to York, and the frontier had once again become Hadrian's Wall. He assumed the title ''{{lang|la|Britannicus}}'' but the title meant little with regard to the unconquered north, which clearly remained outside the authority of the Empire. Almost immediately, another northern tribe, the [[Maeatae]], again went to war. Caracalla left with a [[punitive expedition]], but by the following year his ailing father had died and he and his brother left the province to press their claim to the throne.\n\nAs one of his last acts, Severus tried to solve the problem of powerful and rebellious governors in Britain by dividing the province into ''{{lang|la|[[Britannia Superior]]}}'' and ''{{lang|la|[[Britannia Inferior]]}}''. This kept the potential for rebellion in check for almost a century. Historical sources provide little information on the following decades, a period known as the Long Peace. Even so, the number of buried hoards found from this period rises, suggesting continuing unrest. A string of forts were built along the coast of southern Britain to control piracy; and over the following hundred years they increased in number, becoming the [[Saxon Shore|Saxon Shore Forts]].\n\nDuring the middle of the 3rd century, the Roman Empire was convulsed by barbarian invasions, rebellions and new imperial pretenders. Britannia apparently avoided these troubles, but increasing [[inflation]] had its economic effect. In 259 a so-called [[Gallic Empire]] was established when [[Postumus]] rebelled against [[Gallienus]]. Britannia was part of this until 274 when [[Aurelian]] reunited the empire.\n\nAround the year 280, a half-[[Romano-Britons|British]] officer named [[Bonosus (usurper)|Bonosus]] was in command of the Roman's [[Classis Germanica|Rhenish fleet]] when the [[Germania|Germans]] managed to burn it at anchor. To avoid punishment, he [[Roman usurper|proclaimed himself emperor]] at [[Colonia Agrippina]] ([[Cologne]]) but was crushed by [[Marcus Aurelius Probus]]. Soon afterwards, an unnamed [[governors of Roman Britain|governor]] of one of the British provinces also attempted an uprising. Probus put it down by sending irregular troops of [[Vandals]] and [[Burgundians]] across the Channel.\n\nThe [[Carausian Revolt]] led to a short-lived [[Britannic Empire]] from 286 to 296. [[Carausius]] was a [[Menapii|Menapian]] [[Roman navy|naval]] commander of the [[Classis Britannica|Britannic fleet]]; he revolted upon learning of a death sentence ordered by the emperor [[Maximian]] on charges of having abetted [[Franks|Frankish]] and [[Saxon people|Saxon]] [[Roman piracy|pirates]] and having embezzled recovered treasure. He consolidated control over all the provinces of Britain and some of northern Gaul while Maximian dealt with other uprisings. An invasion in 288 failed to unseat him and an uneasy peace ensued, with Carausius issuing coins and inviting official recognition. In 293, the [[caesar (title)|junior emperor]] [[Constantius Chlorus]] launched a second offensive, besieging the rebel port of [[Gesoriacum]] ([[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]) by land and sea. After it fell, Constantius attacked Carausius's other Gallic holdings and Frankish allies and Carausius was usurped by his treasurer, [[Allectus]]. [[Julius Asclepiodotus]] landed an invasion fleet near [[Southampton]] and defeated Allectus in a land battle.<ref>{{citation |author=Anonymous |title=[[Panegyrici Latini]] |at=VIII.10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=[[Aurelius Victor]] |title=Liber de Caesaribus  |language=la|trans-title=Book of Caesars |at=[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#39 39] }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] |title=Breviarium historiae Romanae  |language=la|trans-title=Abridgement of Roman History |at=[http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#21 21\u201322] }}</ref><ref>{{citation |author=[[Orosius]] |title=Historiae Adversus Paganos  |language=la|trans-title=Seven Books of History Against the Pagans |at=[http://www.attalus.org/latin/orosius7A.html#25 7.25] }}</ref>\n\n=== Diocletian's reforms ===\n{{main article|Britannia I|Britannia II|Flavia Caesariensis|Maxima Caesariensis|Valentia (Roman province)}}\n[[File:Roman Britain 410.jpg|right|upright=0.9|thumb|One possible arrangement of the late Roman provinces, with [[Valentia (Roman Britain)|Valentia]] between the walls.]]\n[[File:Roman Britain - AD 400.png|right|upright=0.9|thumb|Another possible arrangement, with other possible placements of [[Valentia (Roman province)|Valentia]] noted.]]\nAs part of [[Diocletian#Reforms|Diocletian's reforms]], the provinces of Roman Britain were organized as a [[Roman diocese|diocese]] subordinate to a praetorian prefect resident with an emperor and from 318 a prefect based at [[Augusta Treverorum]] ([[Trier]]), Julius Bassus, prefect to Constantine's son Crispus. Prior to this appointment, two was the canonical number of prefects (not counting those of usurpers). The territorial prefectures first appear circa 325. Four are listed in 331. It is certain that the [[vicarius|diocesan vicar]] was based at Londinium as the principal city of the diocese, as it had been for 250 years;{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} that Londinium and Eboracum continued as provincial capitals; and that the territory was divided up into smaller provinces for administrative efficiency and presence as the governors, heretofore mainly judicial and administrative officials, assumed more financial duties (as the procurators of the Treasury ministry were slowly phased out in the first three decades of the 4th century). The governors were stripped of military command (a process completed by 314), which was handed over to duces. Civilian and military authority would no longer be exercised by one official, with rare exceptions until the mid-5th century, when a dux/governor was appointed for Upper Egypt. The tasks of the vicar were to control and coordinate the activities of governors; monitor but not interfere with the daily functioning of the Treasury and Crown Estates, which had their own administrative infrastructure; and act as the regional quartermaster-general of the armed forces. In short, as the sole civilian official with superior authority, he had general oversight of the administration, as well as direct control, while not absolute, over governors who were part of the prefecture; the other two fiscal departments were not.     \n\nThe early-4th-century [[Verona List]], the late-4th-century work of [[Sextus Rufus]], and the early-5th-century [[Notitia Dignitatum|List of Offices]] and work of [[Polemius Silvius]] all list four provinces by some variation of the names [[Britannia Prima|Britannia I]], [[Britannia Secunda|Britannia II]], [[Maxima Caesariensis]], and [[Flavia Caesariensis]]; all of these seem to have initially been directed by a [[governors of Roman Britain|governor]] (''[[praeses]]'') of [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] rank. The 5th-century sources list a fifth province named [[Valentia (Roman Britain)|Valentia]] and give its governor and Maxima's a [[Roman consul|consular]] rank.{{refn|The [[Verona List]] actually includes a note that the Diocese of the Britains had ''six'' provinces, but then lists four. [[Sextus Rufus]] listed six provinces, including the highly dubious \"province of [[Orkneys|the Orcades]]\" (Orkneys). Some scholars{{who|date=February 2015}} argue that the initial reforms established three provinces: Britannia&nbsp;I, Britannia&nbsp;II, and Britannia Caesariensis, which was subsequently divided into Flavia and Maxima.}} [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] mentions Valentia as well, describing its creation by [[Count Theodosius]] in 369 after the quelling of the [[Great Conspiracy]].

Little is known of his campaigns with scant archaeological evidence, but fragmentary historical sources suggest he reached the far north of Britain and won a major battle in early summer before returning south. He died in [[York]] in July 306 with his son [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] at his side. Constantine then successfully used Britain as the starting point of his march to the imperial throne, unlike the earlier usurper, Albinus.\n\nIn the middle of the century, for a few years the province was loyal to the usurper [[Magnentius]], who succeeded [[Constans]] following the latter's death. After the defeat and death of Magnentius in the [[Battle of Mons Seleucus]] in 353, [[Constantius II]] dispatched his chief imperial notary [[Paulus Catena]] to Britain to hunt down Magnentius's supporters. The investigation deteriorated into a [[witch-hunt]], which forced the ''{{lang|la|vicarius}}'' [[Flavius Martinus]] to intervene. When Paulus retaliated by accusing Martinus of treason, the ''{{lang|la|vicarius}}'' attacked Paulus with a sword, with the aim of assassinating him, but in the end he committed suicide.\n\nAs the 4th century progressed, there were increasing attacks from the [[Saxons]] in the east and the [[Scoti]] (Irish) in the west. A series of forts was already being built, starting around 280, to defend the coasts, but these preparations were not enough when a general assault of Saxons, Scoti and [[Attacotti]], combined with apparent dissension in the garrison on Hadrian's Wall, left Roman Britain prostrate in 367. This crisis, sometimes called the Barbarian Conspiracy or the [[Great Conspiracy]], was settled by [[Count Theodosius]] with a string of military and civil reforms.\n\nAnother imperial usurper, [[Magnus Maximus]], raised the standard of revolt at [[Segontium]] ([[Caernarfon]]) in north Wales in 383, and crossed the [[English Channel]]. Maximus held much of the western empire, and fought a successful campaign against the [[Picts]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] around 384. His continental exploits required troops from Britain, and it appears that forts at Chester and elsewhere were abandoned in this period, triggering raids and settlement in north Wales by the Irish. His rule was ended in 388, but not all the British troops may have returned: the Empire's military resources were stretched to the limit along the Rhine and Danube.\nAround 396 there were more barbarian incursions into Britain. [[Stilicho]] led a punitive expedition.\nIt seems peace was restored by 399, and it is likely that no further garrisoning was ordered; by 401 more troops were withdrawn, to assist in the war against [[Alaric I]].\n\n=== End of Roman rule ===\n{{Main article|End of Roman rule in Britain}}\n[[File:Brittain 410.jpg|thumb|Roman Britain in 410]]\nThe traditional view of historians, informed by the work of [[Michael Rostovtzeff]], was of a widespread economic decline at the beginning of the 5th century. Consistent archaeological evidence has told another story, and the accepted view is undergoing re-evaluation. Some features are agreed: more opulent but fewer urban houses, an end to new public building and some abandonment of existing ones, with the exception of defensive structures, and the widespread formation of \"[[dark earth]]\" deposits indicating increased horticulture within urban precincts.<ref>Archaeological evidence of late 4th-century urban collapse is analysed by {{cite book |author=Simon Esmonde Cleary |title=The Ending of Roman Britain |year=1989 }}; the \"de-romanisation\" of Britain is the subject of several accounts by Richard Reece, including \"Town and country: the end of Roman Britain\", ''World Archaeology'' '''12''' (1980:77\u201392) and \"The end of the city in Roman Britain\", in J.

Many buildings changed use but were not destroyed. There were growing barbarian attacks, but these were focused on vulnerable rural settlements rather than towns. Some villas such as [[Great Casterton]] in [[Rutland]] and [[Hucclecote]] in [[Gloucestershire]] had new mosaic floors laid around this time, suggesting that economic problems may have been limited and patchy. Many suffered some decay before being abandoned in the 5th century; the story of [[Saint Patrick]] indicates that villas were still occupied until at least 430. Exceptionally, new buildings were still going up in this period in [[Verulamium]] and [[Cirencester]]. Some urban centres, for example [[Canterbury]], [[Cirencester]], [[Wroxeter]], [[Winchester]] and [[Gloucester]], remained active during the 5th and 6th centuries, surrounded by large farming estates.\n\nUrban life had generally grown less intense by the fourth quarter of the 4th century, and coins minted between 378 and 388 are very rare, indicating a likely combination of economic decline, diminishing numbers of troops, problems with the payment of soldiers and officials or with unstable conditions during the usurpation of Magnus Maximus 383\u201387. Coinage circulation increased during the 390s, but never attained the levels of earlier decades. Copper coins are very rare after 402, though minted silver and gold coins from hoards indicate they were still present in the province even if they were not being spent. By 407 there were no new Roman coins going into circulation, and by 430 it is likely that coinage as a medium of exchange had been abandoned. Pottery mass production probably ended a decade or two previously; the rich continued to use metal and glass vessels, while the poor probably adopted leather or wooden ones.\n\n=== Sub-Roman Britain ===\n{{Main article|Sub-Roman Britain}}\n[[File:Arth tapestry2.jpg|thumb|[[King Arthur]] is a legendary figure of [[Sub-Roman Britain]] who is said to have fought the invading Saxons]]\nTowards the end of the 4th century Britain came under increasing pressure from [[barbarian]] attacks, and there were not enough troops to mount an effective defence. After elevating two disappointing [[Roman usurper|usurpers]], the army chose a soldier, [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine III]], to become emperor in 407. He crossed to Gaul but was defeated by [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]; it is unclear how many troops remained or ever returned, or whether a commander-in-chief in Britain was ever reappointed. A [[Saxons|Saxon]] incursion in 408 was apparently repelled by the [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]], and in 409 [[Zosimus]] records that the natives expelled the Roman civilian administration. Zosimus may be referring to the Bacaudic rebellion of the [[Bretons|Breton]] inhabitants of [[Armorica]] since he describes how, in the aftermath of the revolt, all of Armorica and the rest of Gaul followed the example of the Brettaniai. A letter from Emperor Honorius in 410 has traditionally been seen as rejecting a British appeal for help, but it may have been addressed to [[Calabria|Bruttium]] or [[Bologna]].<ref name=\"Moorhead\">{{cite book |authors=Sam Moorhead and David Stuttard |year=2012 |title=The Romans who Shaped Britain |location=London |publisher=Thames & Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-25189-8 |page=238 }}</ref> With the imperial layers of the military and civil government gone, administration and justice fell to municipal authorities, and local warlords gradually emerged all over Britain, still utilizing [[Romano-British]] ideals and conventions.

There is recorded evidence, for example, of Germanic [[auxilia]]ries supporting the legions in Britain in the 1st and 2nd centuries. The new arrivals rebelled, plunging the country into a series of wars that eventually led to the Saxon occupation of Lowland Britain by 600. Around this time, many Britons fled to [[Brittany]] (hence its name), [[Britonia|Galicia]] and probably [[Ireland]]. A significant date in sub-Roman Britain is the [[Groans of the Britons]], an unanswered appeal to [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]], leading general of the western Empire, for assistance against Saxon invasion in 446. Another is the [[Battle of Deorham]] in 577, after which the significant cities of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Cirencester]] and [[Gloucester]] fell and the Saxons reached the western sea.\n\nMost scholars reject the historicity of the later [[legend]]s of [[King Arthur]], which seem to be set in this period, but some such as [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] think there may be some truth to them.\n\n== Trade ==\n{{See also|British Iron Age#Trade between Iron Age Britain and the Roman world|l1=Trade between Iron Age Britain and the Roman world}}\n\nDuring the Roman period Britain's continental trade was principally directed across the Southern [[North Sea]] and Eastern [[English Channel|Channel]], focusing on the narrow [[Strait of Dover]], with more limited links via the Atlantic seaways.<ref name=\"Morris 2010\">{{cite book |author=Francis Morris |year=2010 |title=North Sea and Channel Connectivity during the Late Iron Age and Roman Period (175/150 BC&nbsp;\u2013 409&nbsp;AD) |series=British Archaeological Reports International Series |issue=2157 |location=Oxford |publisher=Archaeopress }}</ref><ref name=\"Fulford 2007\">{{citation |author=Michael Fulford |year=2007 |chapter=Coasting Britannia: Roman trade and traffic around the shores of Britain |editors=Chris Gosden, Helena Hamerow, Philip de Jersey, and Gary Lock |title=Communities and Connections: Essays in Honour of Barry Cunliffe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxYwMxyTBQIC |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-923034-1 |pages=54\u201374 }}</ref><ref name=\"Cunliffe\">{{cite book |author=Barry Cunliffe |year=2002 |title=Facing the Ocean: the Atlantic and its Peoples 8000 BC&nbsp;\u2013 1500&nbsp;AD |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Mx-AAAACAAJ |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-285354-7 }}</ref> The most important British ports were London and [[Richborough Castle|Richborough]], whilst the continental ports most heavily engaged in trade with Britain were [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and the sites of [[Domburg]] and [[Colijnsplaat]] at the mouth of the river [[Scheldt]].<ref name=\"Morris 2010\"/><ref name=\"Fulford 2007\"/> During the Late Roman period it is likely that the [[saxon Shore|shore forts]] played some role in continental trade alongside their defensive functions.<ref name=\"Morris 2010\"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Andrew Pearson |year=2002 |title=The Roman Shore Forts: Coastal Defences of Southern Britain |publisher=The History Press |isbn=978-0-7524-1949-7 }}</ref>\n\nExports to Britain included: [[roman currency|coin]]; [[ancient Roman pottery|pottery]], particularly red-gloss ''{{lang|la|[[terra sigillata]]}}'' (samian ware) from southern, central and eastern [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], as well as various other wares from Gaul and the [[Rhine]] provinces; olive oil from southern [[Hispania|Spain]] in ''{{lang|la|[[amphora]]e}}''; wine from Gaul in ''{{lang|la|amphorae}}'' and barrels; salted fish products from the western Mediterranean and [[Brittany]] in barrels and amphorae; preserved olives from southern Spain in ''{{lang|la|amphorae}}''; lava [[quern-stone]]s from [[Mayen]] on the middle Rhine; glass; and some agricultural products.<ref name=\"Morris 2010\"/><ref name=\"Fulford 2007\"/><ref name=\"Tyers Pottery\">{{cite book |author=Paul Tyers |year=1996 |title=Roman Pottery in Britain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JFlQgAACAAJ |location=London |publisher=Batsford |isbn=978-0-7134-7412-1 }}</ref><ref name=\"Tyers amphorae\">{{cite journal |author=Paul Tyers |year=1996 |title=Roman amphoras in Britain |journal=Internet Archaeology |volume=1 |publisher=Council for British Archaeology |doi=10.11141/ia.1.6 }}</ref><ref name=\"Peacock & Williams\">{{cite book |authors=D.

The mine developed as a series of opencast workings, mainly by the use of [[hydraulic mining]] methods. They are described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] in great detail. Essentially, water supplied by [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] was used to prospect for ore veins by stripping away soil to reveal the [[bedrock]]. If veins were present, they were attacked using [[fire-setting]] and the ore removed for crushing and [[comminution]]. The dust was washed in a small stream of water and the heavy gold dust and [[gold nugget]]s collected in [[riffle#Gold mining|riffles]]. The diagram at right shows how Dolaucothi developed from {{c.|lk=no}} 75 through to the 1st century. When opencast work was no longer feasible, tunnels were driven to follow the veins. The evidence from the site shows advanced technology probably under the control of army engineers.\n\nThe [[Weald]]en ironworking zone, the lead and silver mines of the [[Mendip Hills]] and the tin mines of Cornwall seem to have been private enterprises leased from the government for a fee. Mining had long been practised in Britain (see [[Grimes Graves]]), but the Romans introduced new technical knowledge and large-scale industrial production to revolutionise the industry. It included [[hydraulic mining]] to prospect for ore by removing overburden as well as work alluvial deposits. The water needed for such large-scale operations was supplied by one or more [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]], those surviving at Dolaucothi being especially impressive. Many prospecting areas were in dangerous, [[highland|upland]] country, and, although mineral exploitation was presumably one of the main reasons for the Roman invasion, it had to wait until these areas were subdued.\n\nRoman designs were most popular, but rural craftsmen still produced items derived from the [[Iron Age]] [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]] artistic traditions. Local pottery rarely attained the standards of the Gaulish industries; the [[Nene Valley Colour Coated Ware|Castor ware]] of the [[River Nene|Nene Valley]] was able to withstand comparison with the imports. Most native pottery was unsophisticated and intended only for local markets.\n\nBy the 3rd century, Britain's economy was diverse and well established, with commerce extending into the non-Romanised north. The design of [[Hadrian's Wall]] especially catered to the need for customs inspections of merchants' goods.\n\n== Government ==<!--linked-->\nUnder the Roman Empire, administration of peaceful provinces was ultimately the remit of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], but those, like Britain, that required permanent garrisons were placed under the Emperor's control. In practice imperial provinces were run by resident [[Roman governor|governors]] who were members of the Senate and had held the [[Roman consul|consulship]]. These men were carefully selected, often having strong records of military success and administrative ability. In Britain, a governor's role was primarily military, but numerous other tasks were also his responsibility such as maintaining diplomatic relations with local client kings, building roads, ensuring the public courier system functioned, supervising the ''{{lang|la|[[civitas|civitates]]}}'' and acting as a judge in important legal cases. When not campaigning he would travel the province hearing complaints and recruiting new troops.\n\nTo assist him in legal matters he had an adviser, the ''{{lang|la|legatus juridicus}}'', and those in Britain appear to have been distinguished lawyers perhaps because of the challenge of incorporating tribes into the imperial system and devising a workable method of taxing them. Financial administration was dealt with by a ''[[promagistrate|procurator]]'' with junior posts for each tax-raising power. Each legion in Britain had a commander who answered to the governor and in time of war probably directly ruled troublesome districts. Each of these commands carried a tour of duty of two to three years in different provinces. Below these posts was a network of administrative managers covering intelligence gathering, sending reports to Rome, organising military supplies and dealing with prisoners. A staff of seconded soldiers provided clerical services.\n\nColchester was probably the earliest capital of Roman Britain, but it was soon eclipsed by London with its strong mercantile connections.  The different forms of municipal organisation in Britannia were known as ''{{lang|la|civitas}}'' (which were subdivided, amongst other forms, into ''{{lang|la|colonies}}'' such as York, Colchester, Gloucester and Lincoln and ''municipalities'' such as Verulamium), and were each governed by a senate of local landowners, whether Brythonic or Roman, who elected magistrates concerning judicial and civic affairs.<ref name=\"Jones 1998\">{{cite book |author=Michael E.

Small timber churches are suggested at [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] and [[Silchester]] and [[baptismal font]]s have been found at [[Icklingham]] and the [[Saxon Shore|Saxon Shore Fort]] at [[Richborough]]. The Icklingham font is made of lead, and visible in the British Museum. A Roman Christian graveyard exists at the same site in Icklingham. A possible Roman 4th-century church and associated burial ground was also discovered at Butt Road on the south-west outskirts of [[Colchester]] during the construction of the new police station there, overlying an earlier pagan cemetery. The [[Water Newton Treasure]] is a hoard of Christian silver church plate from the early 4th century and the [[Roman villa]]s at [[Lullingstone]] and [[Hinton St Mary]] contained Christian wall paintings and mosaics respectively. A large 4th-century cemetery at [[Poundbury]] with its east-west oriented burials and lack of [[grave goods]] has been interpreted as an early Christian burial ground, although such burial rites were also becoming increasingly common in pagan contexts during the period.\n\nThe Church in Britain seems to have developed the customary diocesan system, as evidenced from the records of the [[Synod of Arles (314)|Council of Arles]] in Gaul in 314: represented at the Council were [[bishop]]s from thirty-five [[Holy See|sees]] from Europe and North Africa, including three bishops from Britain, Eborius of York, [[Restitutus]] of London, and Adelphius, possibly a [[bishop of Lincoln]].

The Romans also built water supply, [[sanitation]] and [[wastewater]] systems. Many of Britain's major cities, such as London ([[Londinium]]), [[Manchester]] ([[Mamucium]]) and [[York]] ([[Eboracum]]), were founded by the Romans, but the original Roman settlements were abandoned not long after the Romans left.\n\nUnlike many other areas of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the current majority language is not a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] - or a language descended from the pre-Roman inhabitants. The British language at the time of the invasion was [[Common Brittonic]], and remained so after the Romans withdrew. It later split into regional languages, notably [[Cumbric Language|Cumbric]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. Examination of these languages suggests some 800 latin words were incorporated into Common Brittonic (see [[Brittonic languages]]). The current majority language, English, is based on the languages of the Germanic tribes who migrated to the island from continental Europe from the 5th century onwards.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Ancient Rome|Celtic Studies|United Kingdom}}\n* [[Prehistoric Britain]]\n* [[Britannia (disambiguation)]]\n* [[End of Roman rule in Britain]]\n* [[Governors of Roman Britain]]\n* [[Roman client kingdoms in Britain]]\n* [[History of the British Isles]]\n* [[Romano-British culture]]\n* [[Sub-Roman Britain]]\n* [[Roman sites in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Mining in Roman Britain]]\n* [[Dolaucothi Gold Mines]]\n* [[Scotland during the Roman Empire]]\n* [[Romano-Celtic temple]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n=== Iron Age background ===\n* {{cite book |author=John Creighton |year=2000 |title=Coins and power in Late Iron Age Britain |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwlUgNrYW8MC |isbn=978-1-139-43172-9 }}\n* {{cite book |author=Barry Cunliffe |year=2005 |title=Iron Age Communities in Britain |edition=4th |location=London |publisher=Routledge }}\n\n=== General works on Roman Britain ===\n* {{cite book |author=Joan P Alcock |year=2011 |title=A Brief History of Roman Britain Conquest and Civilization |location=London |publisher=Constable & Robinson |isbn=978-1-84529-728-2 }}\n* {{cite book |author=[[Guy de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re]] |year=2006 |title=Roman Britain: a New History |location=London |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-05140-5 }}\n* {{cite book |author=Simon Esmonde-Cleary |year=1989 |title=The Ending of Roman Britain |location=London |publisher=Batsford |isbn=978-0-415-23898-4 }}\n* {{cite book |author=Sheppard Frere |year=1987 |title=Britannia.

'''Hemiplegia''' is, in its most severe form, complete [[paralysis]] of half of the body.  Hemiparesis and hemiplegia can be caused by different medical conditions, including congenital causes, trauma, tumors, or stroke.<ref name=\"FactsInfo\">[http://www.disabled-world.com/health/neurology/hemiparesis.php Detailed article about hemiparesis] at Disabled-World.com</ref>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nDepending on the type of hemiparesis diagnosed, different bodily functions can be affected.  Some effects are expected (e.g., partial paralysis of a limb on the affected side). Other impairments, though, can at first seem completely non-related to the limb weakness but are, in fact, a direct result of the damage to the affected side of the brain.<ref name=\"FactsInfo\" />\n\n===Loss of motor skills===\nPeople with hemiparesis often have difficulties maintaining their balance due to limb weaknesses leading to an inability to properly shift body weight. This makes performing everyday activities such as dressing, eating, grabbing objects, or using the bathroom more difficult. Hemiparesis with origin in the lower section of the brain creates a condition known as [[ataxia]], a loss of both gross and fine motor skills, often manifesting as staggering and stumbling. Pure Motor Hemiparesis, a form of hemiparesis characterized by sided weakness in the leg, arm, and face, is the most commonly diagnosed form of hemiparesis.<ref name=\"FactsInfo\" />\n\n===Pusher syndrome===\n{{main|Pusher syndrome}}\nPusher syndrome is a clinical disorder following left or right brain damage in which patients actively push their weight away from the nonhemiparetic side to the hemiparetic side.  In contrast to most [[stroke]] patients, who typically prefer more weight-bearing on their nonhemiparetic side, this abnormal condition can vary in severity and leads to a loss of postural balance.<ref name=Karnath03>{{cite journal |vauthors=Karnath HO, Broetz D |title=Understanding and treating \"pusher syndrome\" |journal=Phys Ther |volume=83 |issue=12 |pages=1119\u201325 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14640870 |url=http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14640870 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415154438/http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14640870 |archivedate=2013-04-15 |df= }}</ref> The lesion involved in this syndrome is thought to be in the posterior [[thalamus]] on either side, or multiple areas of the right [[cerebral hemisphere]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Karnath HO, Ferber S, Dichgans J |title=The origin of contraversive pushing: evidence for a second graviceptive system in humans |journal=Neurology |volume=55 |issue=9 |pages=1298\u2013304 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11087771 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11087771 |doi=10.1212/wnl.55.9.1298}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Karnath HO, Ferber S, Dichgans J |title=The neural representation of postural control in humans |journal=Proc.

The use of the nonparetic extremities to create the pathological lateral tilt of the body axis is another sign to be noted when diagnosing for pusher behaviour.  This includes abduction and extension of the extremities of the  non-affected side, to help in the push toward the affected (paretic) side.  The third variable that is seen is that attempts of the therapist to correct the pusher posture by aiming to realign them to upright posture are resisted by the patient.<ref name=Karnath03/>\n\nIn patients with acute stroke and hemiparesis, the disorder is present in 10.4% of patients.<ref name=Pedersen96>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pedersen PM, Wandel A, J\u00f8rgensen HS, Nakayama H, Raaschou HO, Olsen TS |title=Ipsilateral pushing in stroke: incidence, relation to neuropsychological symptoms, and impact on rehabilitation.

The Copenhagen Stroke Study found that patients that presented with [[ipsilateral]] pushing used 3.6 weeks more to reach the same functional outcome level on the [[Barthel Index]], than did patients without ipsilateral pushing.<ref name=Pedersen96/>\n\nPushing behavior has shown that perception of body [[Human position|posture]] in relation to gravity is altered. Patients experience their body as oriented \"upright\" when the body is actually tilted to the side of the brain lesion.  In addition, patients seem to show no disturbed processing of visual and vestibular inputs when determining subjective visual vertical. In sitting, the push presents as a strong lateral lean toward the affected side and in standing, creates a highly unstable situation as the patient is unable to support their body weight on the weakened lower extremity. The increased risk of falls must be addressed with therapy to correct their altered perception of vertical.\n\nPusher syndrome is sometimes confused with and used interchangeably as the term [[hemispatial neglect]], and some previous theories suggest that neglect leads to pusher syndrome.<ref name=Karnath03/>  However, another study had observed that pusher syndrome is also present in patients with left hemisphere lesions, leading to [[aphasia]], providing a stark contrast to what was previously believed regarding hemispatial neglect, which mostly occurs with a right hemisphere lesion.<ref>{{cite book |last=Davies |first=P.M. |title=Steps to follow: A guide to the treatment of adult hemiplegia : Based on the concept of K. and B.

However, the article goes on to state that it is imperative to note that both neglect and aphasia are not the underlying causes of pusher syndrome.\n\nPhysical therapists focus on [[motor learning]] strategies when treating these patients. Verbal cues, consistent feedback, practicing correct orientation and weight shifting are all effective strategies used to reduce the effects of this disorder.<ref>{{cite book |author=O'Sullivan, S. |chapter=Ch. 12: Stroke |chapterurl= |editor1=O'Sullivan, S. |editor2=Schmitz, T. |title=Physical Rehabilitation |publisher=F.A.

In sequential order, treatment is designed for patients to realize their altered perception of vertical, use visual aids for feedback about body orientation, learn the movements necessary to reach proper vertical position, and maintain vertical body position while performing other activities.<ref name=Karnath03 />\n\n===Classification of pusher syndrome===\nIndividuals who present with pusher syndrome or lateropulsion, as defined by Davies, vary in their degree and severity of this condition and therefore appropriate measures need to be implemented in order to evaluate the level of \"pushing\". There has been a shift towards early diagnosis and evaluation of functional status for individuals who have suffered from a [[stroke]] and presenting with pusher syndrome in order to decrease the time spent as an in-patient at hospitals and promote the return to function as early as possible.<ref name=\"Lagerqvist & Skargren\">{{cite journal|author1=Lagerqvist, J.  |author2=Skargren, E.|title=Pusher syndrome: reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of a classification instrument|journal=Advances in Physiotherapy|year=2006|volume=8|pages=154\u2013160|doi=10.1080/14038190600806596}}</ref> Moreover, in order to assist therapists in the classification of pusher syndrome, specific scales have been developed with validity that coincides with the criteria set out by Davies\u2019 definition of \"pusher syndrome\".<ref name=Babyar09>{{cite journal |vauthors=Babyar SR, Peterson MG, Bohannon R, P\u00e9rennou D, Reding M |title=Clinical examination tools for lateropulsion or pusher syndrome following stroke: a systematic review of the literature |journal=Clin Rehabil |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=639\u201350 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19403555 |doi=10.1177/0269215509104172 |url=http://cre.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19403555}}</ref> In a study by Babyar ''et al.'', an examination of such scales helped determine the relevance, practical aspects and clinimetric properties of three specific scales existing today for lateropulsion.<ref name=Babyar09 /> The three scales examined were the Clinical Scale of Contraversive Pushing, Modified Scale of Contraversive Pushing, and the Burke Lateropulsion Scale.<ref name=Babyar09 /> The results of the study show that reliability for each scale is good; moreover, the Scale of Contraversive Pushing was determined to have acceptable clinimetric properties, and the other two scales addressed more functional positions that will help therapists with clinical decisions and research.<ref name=Babyar09 />\n\n==Causes==\nThe most common cause of hemiparesis and hemiplegia is [[stroke]]. Strokes can cause a variety of movement disorders, depending on the location and severity of the [[lesion]]. Hemiplegia is common when the stroke affects the [[corticospinal tract]]. Other causes of hemiplegia include [[spinal cord injury]], specifically [[Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome]], [[traumatic brain injury]], or disease affecting the [[brain]]. As a [[lesion]] that results in hemiplegia occurs in the brain or spinal cord, hemiplegic muscles display features of the [[upper motor neuron syndrome]]. Features other than weakness include decreased movement control, [[clonus]] (a series of involuntary rapid muscle contractions), [[spasticity]], exaggerated deep tendon reflexes and decreased endurance.\n\nThe incidence of hemiplegia is much higher in premature babies than term babies. There is also a high incidence of hemiplegia during [[pregnancy]] and experts believe that this may be related to either a traumatic delivery, use of [[forceps]] or some event which causes brain injury.<ref>[http://www.chasa.org/hemiplegia.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204172129/http://www.chasa.org/hemiplegia.htm |date=February 4, 2012 }}</ref> There is tentative evidence of an association with undiagnosed [[celiac disease]] and improvement after withdrawal of [[gluten]] from the diet.<ref name=\"ShapiroBlanco2017\">{{cite journal| vauthors=Shapiro M, Blanco DA| title=Neurological Complications of Gastrointestinal Disease. | journal=Semin Pediatr Neurol | year= 2017 | volume= 24 | issue= 1 | pages= 43\u201353 | pmid=28779865 | doi=10.1016/j.spen.2017.02.001 | type=Review }}</ref>\n\nOther causes of hemiplegia in adults include [[physical trauma|trauma]], [[bleeding]], brain [[infection]]s and [[cancer]]s.

Therapists may also recommend a hand splint for active use or for stretching at night. Some therapists actually make the splint; others may measure your child\u2019s hand and order a splint. OTs educate patients and family on compensatory techniques to continue participating in daily living, fostering independence for the individual - which may include, environmental modification, use of adaptive equipment, sensory integration, etc.\n\n==Prognosis==\nHemiplegia is not a progressive disorder, except in progressive conditions like a growing brain tumour. Once the injury has occurred, the symptoms should not worsen. However, because of lack of mobility, other complications can occur. Complications may include muscle and joint stiffness, loss of aerobic fitness, muscle spasms, bed sores, pressure ulcers and [[thrombus|blood clots]].<ref name=\"healthopedia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.healthopedia.com/hemiplegia/ |title=Hemiplegia (Hemiparalysis) |publisher=Healthopedia.com |date=2009-04-06 |accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref>\n\nSudden recovery from hemiplegia is very rare. Many of the individuals will have limited recovery, but the majority will improve from intensive, specialised rehabilitation. Potential to progress may differ in cerebral palsy, compared to adult acquired brain injury.

Two years later he settled at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lyc\u00e9e Blaise-Pascal (Clermont-Ferrand)|fr}} in [[Clermont-Ferrand]], capital of the [[Puy-de-D\u00f4me]] [[d\u00e9partement]].\n\nThe year after his arrival at Clermont-Ferrand Bergson displayed his ability in the humanities by the publication of an edition of extracts from [[Lucretius]], with a critical study of the text and of the [[materialism|materialist]] [[cosmology]] of the poet (1884), a work whose repeated editions{{Which|date=November 2009}} attest to its value in promoting Classics among French youth. While teaching and lecturing in this part of his country (the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] region), Bergson found time for private study and original work. He crafted his dissertation ''Time and Free Will'', which was submitted, along with a short [[Latin]] thesis on [[Aristotle]] (''Quid Aristoteles de loco senserit'', \"On the Concept of Place in Aristotle\"), for his doctoral degree which was awarded by the [[University of Paris]] in 1889. The work was published in the same year by [[F\u00e9lix Alcan]]. He also gave courses in Clermont-Ferrand on the [[Pre-Socratic Philosophy|Pre-Socratics]], in particular on [[Heraclitus]].<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>\n\nBergson dedicated ''Time and Free Will'' to {{ill|Jules Lachelier|fr}} (1832\u20131918), then [[Minister of National Education (France)|public education minister]], a disciple of [[F\u00e9lix Ravaisson]] (1813\u20131900) and the author of a philosophical work ''On the Founding of [[inductive reasoning|Induction]]'' (''Du fondement de l'induction'', 1871). Lachelier endeavoured \"to substitute everywhere force for inertia, life for death, and liberty for fatalism\". (Bergson owed much to both of these teachers of the ''\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure''. Compare his memorial address on Ravaisson, who died in 1900.)\n\nBergson settled again in Paris in 1888,<ref>''Henri Bergson: Key Writings'', ed. Keith Ansell Pearson and John Mullarkey. London: Continuum, 2002, p. ix.</ref> and after teaching for some months at the [[municipal college]], known as the ''College Rollin'', he received an appointment at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Henri-Quatre]], where he remained for eight years. There, he read [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and gave a course on his theories.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> Although Bergson had previously endorsed [[Lamarckism]] and its theory of the [[inheritance of acquired characters|heritability of acquired characteristics]], he came to prefer Darwin's hypothesis of gradual variations, which were more compatible with his continual vision of life.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>\n\nIn 1896 he published his second major work, entitled ''Matter and Memory''. This rather difficult work investigates the function of the brain and undertakes an analysis of [[perception]] and [[memory]], leading up to a careful consideration of the problems of the relation of body and mind. Bergson had spent years of research in preparation for each of his three large works. This is especially obvious in ''Matter and Memory'', where he showed a thorough acquaintance with the extensive pathological investigations which had been carried out during the period.\n\nIn 1898 Bergson became ''[[ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences]]'' at his alma mater, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and later in the same year received a promotion to a Professorship. The year 1900 saw him installed as Professor at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], where he accepted the Chair of [[Greek philosophy|Greek and Roman Philosophy]] in succession to {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles L\u00e9v\u00eaque|fr}}.\n\nAt the first [[International Congress of Philosophy]], held in Paris during the first five days of August 1900, Bergson read a short, but important, paper, \"Psychological Origins of the Belief in the Law of Causality\" (''Sur les origines psychologiques de notre croyance \u00e0 la loi de causalit\u00e9''). In 1900 [[Felix Alcan]] published a work which had previously appeared in the ''[[Revue de Paris]]'', entitled ''[[Laughter (book)|Laughter]]'' (''Le rire''), one of the most important of Bergson's minor productions. This essay on the meaning of comedy stemmed from a lecture which he had given in his early days in the Auvergne. The study of it is essential to an understanding of Bergson's views of life, and its passages dealing with the place of the artistic in life are valuable. The main thesis of the work is that [[laughter]] is a corrective evolved to make social life possible for human beings. We laugh at people who fail to adapt to the demands of society if it seems their failure is akin to an inflexible mechanism. Comic authors have exploited this human tendency to laugh in various ways, and what is common to them is the idea that the comic consists in there being \"something mechanical encrusted on the living\".<ref>p. 39</ref><ref>Seth Benedict Graham ''[http://etd.library.pitt.edu/ETD/available/etd-11032003-192424/unrestricted/grahamsethb_etd2003.pdf A CULTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE RUSSO-SOVIET ANEKDOT]'', 2003, p. 2</ref>\n\nIn 1901 the [[Acad\u00e9mie des sciences morales et politiques]] elected Bergson as a member, and he became a member of the Institute. In 1903 he contributed to the ''[[Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale]]'' a very important essay entitled ''[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Bergson)|Introduction to Metaphysics]]'' (''Introduction \u00e0 la metaphysique''), which is useful as a preface to the study of his three large books. He detailed in this essay his philosophical program, realized in the ''Creative Evolution''.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>\n\nOn the death of [[Gabriel Tarde]], the sociologist and philosopher, in 1904, Bergson succeeded him in the Chair of Modern Philosophy. From 4 to 8 September of that year he visited [[Geneva]], attending the Second International Congress of Philosophy, when he lectured on ''The Mind and Thought: A Philosophical Illusion'' (Le cerveau et la pens\u00e9e: une illusion philosophique). An illness prevented his visiting Germany from attending the Third Congress held at [[Heidelberg]].\n\nHis third major work, ''Creative Evolution'', the most widely known and most discussed of his books, appeared in 1907. Pierre Imbart de la Tour remarked that ''Creative Evolution'' was a milestone of new direction in thought.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} By 1918, [[Alcan]], the publisher, had issued twenty-one editions, making an average of two editions ''per annum'' for ten years. Following the appearance of this book, Bergson's popularity increased enormously, not only in academic circles but among the general reading public.\n\nAt that time, Bergson had already made an extensive study of [[biology]] including the theory of [[fecundation]] (as shown in the first chapter of the ''Creative Evolution''), which had only recently emerged, ca. 1885 \u2013 no small feat for a philosopher specializing in the [[history of philosophy]], in particular Greek and Roman philosophy.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> He also most certainly had read, apart from Darwin, [[Haeckel]], from whom he retained his idea of a unity of life and of the ecological solidarity between all living beings,<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> as well as [[Hugo de Vries]], from whom he quoted his [[mutation theory]] of evolution (which he opposed, preferring Darwin's gradualism).<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> He also quoted [[Charles-\u00c9douard Brown-S\u00e9quard]], the successor of [[Claude Bernard]] at the Chair of Experimental Medicine in the Coll\u00e8ge de France, etc.\n\nBergson served as a juror with [[Florence Meyer Blumenthal]] in awarding the [[Prix Blumenthal]], a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.<ref name=\"FMBlumenthal\">{{Cite web\n  | title = Florence Meyer Blumenthal\n  | publisher = Jewish Women's Archive, Michele Siegel\n  | url = http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/blumenthal-florence-meyer}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with James and pragmatism===\nBergson traveled to London in 1908 and met there with [[William James]], the [[Harvard]] philosopher who was Bergson's senior by seventeen years, and who was instrumental in calling the attention of the Anglo-American public to the work of the French professor. The two became great friends. James's impression of Bergson is given in his Letters under date of 4 October 1908:\n\n<blockquote>So modest and unpretending a man but such a genius intellectually! I have the strongest suspicions that the tendency which he has brought to a focus, will end by prevailing, and that the present epoch will be a sort of turning point in the history of philosophy.</blockquote>\n\nAs early as 1880, James had contributed an article in French to the periodical ''La Critique philosophique'', of Renouvier and Pillon, entitled ''[[Le Sentiment de l'Effort]]''. Four years later, a couple of articles by him appeared in the journal ''Mind'': \"What is an Emotion?\" and \"On some Omissions of Introspective Psychology\". Bergson quoted the first two of these articles in his 1889 work, ''Time and Free Will''. In the following years, 1890\u201391 appeared the two volumes of James's monumental work, ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', in which he refers to a pathological phenomenon observed by Bergson. Some writers, taking merely these dates into consideration and overlooking the fact that James's investigations had been proceeding since 1870 (registered from time to time by various articles which culminated in \"The Principles\"), have mistakenly dated Bergson's ideas as earlier than James's.\n\nIt has been suggested{{By whom|date=September 2009}} that Bergson owes the root ideas of his first book to the 1884 article by James, \"On Some Omissions of Introspective Psychology,\" which he neither refers to nor quotes. This article deals with the conception of thought as a [[stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], which [[intellect]] distorts by framing into concepts. Bergson replied to this insinuation by denying that he had any knowledge of the article by James when he wrote ''Les donn\u00e9es imm\u00e9diates de la conscience''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The two thinkers appear to have developed independently until almost the close of the century. They are further apart in their intellectual position than is frequently supposed. Both have succeeded in appealing to audiences far beyond the purely academic sphere, but only in their mutual rejection of \"intellectualism\" as decisive as their actual agreement. Although James was slightly ahead in the development and enunciation of his ideas, he confessed that he was baffled by many of Bergson's notions. James certainly neglected many of the deeper metaphysical aspects of Bergson's thought, which did not harmonize with his own, and are even in direct contradiction. In addition to this, Bergson can hardly be considered a pragmatist. For him, \"utility,\" far from being a test of truth, was, in fact, the reverse: a synonym for error.\n\nNevertheless, William James hailed Bergson as an ally. In 1903, he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I have been re-reading Bergson's books, and nothing that I have read for years has so excited and stimulated my thoughts. I am sure that his philosophy has a great future; it breaks through old frameworks and brings things to a solution from which new crystallizations can be reached.<ref>\n[http://www.ibiblio.org/HTMLTexts/John_Alexander_Gunn/Bergson_And_His_Philosophy/chapter1.html Bergson and his philosophy] Chapter 1: Life of Bergson\n</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe most noteworthy tributes James paid to Bergson come in the [[Hibbert Lectures]] (A Pluralistic Universe), which James gave at [[Manchester College, Oxford]], shortly after meeting Bergson in London. He remarks on the encouragement he gained from Bergson's thought, and refers to his confidence in being \"able to lean on Bergson's authority.\" (See further James's reservations about Bergson, below.)\n\nThe influence of Bergson had led James \"to renounce the intellectualist method and the current notion that [[logic]] is an adequate measure of what can or cannot be\". It had induced him, he continued, \"to give up logic, squarely and irrevocably\" as a method, for he found that \"reality, life, experience, concreteness, immediacy, use what word you will, exceeds our logic, overflows, and surrounds it\".\n\nThese remarks, which appeared in James's book ''A Pluralistic Universe'' in 1909, impelled many English and American readers to investigate Bergson's philosophy for themselves, but no English translations of Bergson's major work had yet appeared. James, however, encouraged and assisted Dr. [[Arthur Mitchell (physician)|Arthur Mitchell]] in preparing an English translation of ''Creative Evolution''. In August 1910, James died. It was his intention, had he lived to see the translation finished, to introduce it to the English reading public by a prefatory note of appreciation. In the following year, the translation was completed and still greater interest in Bergson and his work was the result. By coincidence, in that same year (1911), Bergson penned a preface of sixteen pages entitled ''Truth and Reality'' for the French translation of James's book, ''Pragmatism''. In it, he expressed sympathetic appreciation of James's work, together with certain important reservations.\n\nFrom 5 to 11 April, Bergson attended the Fourth International Congress of Philosophy held at [[Bologna]], in Italy, where he gave an address on \"Philosophical Intuition\". In response to invitations he visited England in May of that year, and on several subsequent occasions. These visits were well received.{{By whom|date=September 2009}} His speeches offered new perspectives{{Which|date=November 2009}} and elucidated many passages in his three major works: ''Time and Free Will'', ''Matter and Memory'', and ''Creative Evolution''. Although necessarily brief statements, they developed and enriched the ideas in his books and clarified for English audiences the fundamental principles of his philosophy.\n\n===Lectures on change===\nIn May 1911 Bergson gave two lectures entitled ''The Perception of Change'' (''La perception du changement'') at the [[University of Oxford]]. The [[Clarendon Press]] published these in French in the same year.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n|last= Bergson\n|first= Henri\n|title= La perception du changement; conf\u00e9rences faites \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 d'Oxford les 26 et 27 mai 1911\n|trans-title= The perception of change: lectures delivered at the University of Oxford on 26 and 27 May 1911\n|year= 1911\n|publisher= Clarendon\n|location= Oxford\n|language= French\n|page= 37}}\n</ref>\nHis talks were concise and lucid, leading students and the general reader to his other, longer writings. Oxford later conferred on him the degree of [[Doctor of Science]].\n\nTwo days later he delivered the [[Huxley Lecture]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], taking for his subject ''Life and Consciousness''. This subsequently appeared in ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]'' (October 1911), and since revised, is the first essay in the collected volume ''Mind-Energy'' (''L'\u00c9nergie spirituelle''). In October he again traveled to England, where he had an enthusiastic reception, and delivered at [[University College London]] four lectures on ''La Nature de l'\u00c2me'' [The nature of the soul].\n\nIn 1913 Bergson visited the United States of America at the invitation of [[Columbia University]], New York, and lectured in several American cities, where very large audiences welcomed him. In February, at Columbia University, he lectured both in French and English, taking as his subjects: ''Spirituality and Freedom'' and ''The Method of Philosophy''. Being again in England in May of the same year, he accepted the Presidency of the British [[Society for Psychical Research]], and delivered to the Society an address on ''Phantoms of Life and Psychic Research'' (Fant\u00f4mes des vivants et recherche psychique).\n\nMeanwhile, his popularity increased, and translations of his works began to appear in a number of languages: English, German, Italian, Danish, Swedish, Hungarian, Polish, and Russian. In 1914 Bergson's fellow-countrymen honoured him by his election as a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]. He was also made President of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences morales et politiques, and in addition, he became Officier de la [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]], and Officier de l'Instruction publique.\n\nBergson found disciples of many types. In France movements such as [[Neo-Catholicism (France)|neo-Catholicism]] and [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernism]] on the one hand and [[syndicalism]] on the other endeavoured to absorb and appropriate for their own ends some central ideas of his teaching. The continental organ of socialist and syndicalist theory, ''[[Le Mouvement socialiste]]'',<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n| last        = Reberioux\n| first       = M.\n| authorlink  = Madeleine Reb\u00e9rioux\n|date=January\u2013March 1964\n| title       = La gauche socialiste fran\u00e7aise: ''La Guerre Sociale'' et ''Le Mouvement Socialiste'' face au probl\u00e8me colonial\n|trans-title=French right-wing socialism: ''La Guerre Sociale'' and ''Le Mouvement Socialiste'' in the face of the colonial problem\n| journal     = Le Mouvement social\n| volume      =\n| issue       = 46\n| series      =\n| pages       = 91\u2013103\n| publisher   = Editions l'Atelier/Association Le Mouvement Social\n| location    =\n| jstor         = 3777267\n| language    = French\n| quote       = ... deux organes, d'ailleurs si dissembables, ou s'exprime l'extr\u00eame-gauche du courant socialiste fran\u00e7ais: le ''Mouvement socialiste'' d'Hubert Lagardelle et la ''Guerre sociale'' de Gustave Herv\u00e9.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]], however, banned Bergson's three books on the charge of [[pantheism]] (that is, of conceiving of God as immanent to his Creation and of being himself created in the process of the Creation).<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> They were placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of prohibited books]] (Decree of 1 June 1914).\n\n===Later years===\nIn 1914 the Scottish universities arranged for Bergson to give the famous [[Gifford Lectures]], planning one course for the spring and another for the autumn. Bergson delivered the first course, consisting of eleven lectures, under the title of ''The Problem of Personality'', at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in the spring of that year. The course of lectures planned for the autumn months had to be abandoned because of the outbreak of war. Bergson was not, however, silent during the conflict, and he gave some inspiring addresses. As early as 4 November 1914, he wrote an article entitled ''Wearing and Nonwearing forces'' (La force qui s'use et celle qui ne s'use pas), which appeared in that unique and interesting periodical of the ''[[poilu]]s'', ''Le Bulletin des Arm\u00e9es de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise''. A presidential address, ''The Meaning of the War'', was delivered in December 1914, to the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences morales et politiques.\n\nBergson contributed also to the publication arranged by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in honour of King [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I of the Belgians]], ''King Albert's Book'' (Christmas, 1914).<ref>\n{{Cite book\n|title= King Albert's book: a tribute to the Belgian king and people from representative men and women throughout the world\n|year= 1914\n|month=\n|publisher= The Daily Telegraph\n|location= London\n|page= 187\n}}\n</ref>\nIn 1915 he was succeeded in the office of President of the ''Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences morales et politiques'' by [[Alexandre Ribot]], and then delivered a discourse on \"The Evolution of German [[Imperialism]]\". Meanwhile, he found time to issue at the request of the Minister of Public Instruction a brief summary of French Philosophy. Bergson did a large amount of traveling and lecturing in America during the war. He participated in the negotiations which led to the [[World War I#Entry of the United States|entry of the United States]] in the war. He was there when the French Mission under [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] paid a visit in April and May 1917, following upon America's entry into the conflict. Viviani's book ''La Mission fran\u00e7aise en Am\u00e9rique'' (1917), contains a preface by Bergson.\n\nEarly in 1918 the ''[[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]'' received Bergson officially when he took his seat among \"The Select Forty\" as successor to [[Emile Ollivier]] (the author of the historical work ''L'Empire lib\u00e9ral''). A session was held in January in his honour at which he delivered an address on Ollivier. In the war, Bergson saw the conflict of Mind and Matter, or rather of Life and Mechanism; and thus he shows us the central idea of his own philosophy in action. To no other philosopher has it fallen, during his lifetime, to have his philosophical principles so vividly and so terribly tested.\n\nAs many of Bergson's contributions to French periodicals remained relatively inaccessible, he agreed to the request of his friends{{Which|date=November 2009}} to have such works collected and published in two volumes. The first of these was being planned when war broke out. The conclusion of strife was marked by the appearance of a delayed volume in 1919. It bears the title ''Spiritual Energy: Essays and Lectures'' (reprinted as ''Mind-Energy'' \u2013 ''L'\u00c9nergie spirituelle: essais et conf\u00e9rences''). The advocate of Bergson's philosophy in England, Dr. [[Wildon Carr]], prepared an English translation under the title ''Mind-Energy''. The volume opens with the Huxley Memorial Lecture of 1911, \"Life and Consciousness\", in a revised and developed form under the title \"Consciousness and Life\". Signs of Bergson's growing interest in social ethics and in the idea of a future life of personal survival are manifested. The lecture before the Society for Psychical Research is included, as is also the one given in France, ''L'\u00c2me et le Corps'', which contains the substance of the four London lectures on the Soul. The seventh and last article is a reprint of Bergson's famous lecture to the Congress of Philosophy at Geneva in 1904, ''The Psycho-Physiological Paralogism'' (Le paralogisme psycho-physiologique), which now appears as ''Le cerveau et la pens\u00e9e: une illusion philosophique''. Other articles are on the False Recognition, on Dreams, and Intellectual Effort. The volume is a most welcome production and serves to bring together what Bergson wrote on the concept of mental force, and on his view of \"tension\" and \"detension\" as applied to the relation of matter and mind.\n\nIn June 1920, the [[University of Cambridge]] honoured him with the degree of [[Doctor of Letters]]. In order that he might devote his full-time to the great new work he was preparing on ethics, religion, and sociology, the Coll\u00e8ge de France relieved Bergson of the duties attached to the Chair of Modern Philosophy there. He retained the chair, but no longer delivered lectures, his place being taken by his disciple, the mathematician and philosopher [[\u00c9douard Le Roy]], who supported a [[conventionalism|conventionalist]] stance on the [[foundations of mathematics]], which was adopted by Bergson.<ref name=TheCreativeEvolution>See Chapter III of [https://archive.org/stream/creativeevolu1st00berguoft#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Creative Evolution'']</ref> Le Roy, who also succeeded to Bergson at the ''Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise'' and was a fervent Catholic, extended to [[Revelation|revealed truth]] his conventionalism, leading him to privilege faith, heart and sentiment to [[dogma]]s, speculative theology and abstract reasoning. Like Bergson's, his writings were placed on the Index by the Vatican.\n\n===Debate with Albert Einstein===\nIn the fall of 1922 Bergson's book ''Dur\u00e9e et simultan\u00e9it\u00e9, a propos de la theorie d'Einstein'' (''Duration and Simultaneity: Bergson and the Einsteinian Universe'') was published.<ref>[[Jimena Canales|Canales J.]], ''The Physicist and the Philosopher: Einstein, Bergson and the Debate That Changed Our Understanding of Time'', Princeton, Princeton Press, 2015.</ref>  Earlier in the spring Einstein had come to the French Society of Philosophy and briefly replied to a short speech made by Bergson.<ref>Minutes of the meeting:[http://s3.archive-host.com/membres/up/784571560/GrandesConfPhiloSciences/philosc13_einstein_1922.pdf S\u00e9ance du 6 Avril 1922]</ref> The book has been often considered as one of his worst, many alleging that his knowledge of physics was insufficient, and that the book did not follow up contemporary developments on physics.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> (But in \"Einstein and the Crisis of Reason\", a leading French philosopher, [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], accused Einstein of failing to grasp Bergson's argument. This argument, Merleau-Ponty says, which concerns not the physics of special relativity but its philosophical foundations, addresses paradoxes caused by popular interpretations and misconceptions about the theory, including Einstein's own.<ref>Signs, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, trans. Richard C. McCleary, Northwestern Univ. Press, 1964.</ref>) It was not published in the 1951 ''Edition du Centenaire'' in French, which contained all of his other works, and was only published later in a work gathering different essays, titled ''M\u00e9langes''. ''Duration and simultaneity'' took advantage of Bergson's experience at the [[League of Nations]], where he presided from 1920 to 1925 the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] (the ancestor of the [[UNESCO]], which included Einstein, [[Marie Curie]], etc.).<ref>On the relation between Einstein and Bergson in this Committee, see [http://www.jimenacanales.org/pdf-files/canales-Einstein,%20Bergson%20and%20the%20Experiment%20that%20Failed.pdf ''Einstein, Bergson and the Experiment that Failed: Intellectual Cooperation at the League of Nations''].

Because of serious [[rheumatology|rheumatics ailments]], he could not travel to Stockholm, and sent instead a text subsequently published in ''La Pens\u00e9e et le mouvant''.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1928.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter his retirement from the Coll\u00e8ge, Bergson began to fade into obscurity: he suffered from a degenerative illness (rheumatism, which left him half paralyzed<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>). He completed his new work, ''The Two Sources of Morality and Religion'', which extended his philosophical theories to the realms of morality, religion, and art, in 1935. It was respectfully received by the public and the philosophical community, but all by that time realized that Bergson's days as a philosophical luminary were passed. He was, however, able to reiterate his core beliefs near the end of his life, by renouncing all of the posts and honours previously awarded him, rather than accept exemption from the [[Statute on Jews|antisemitic laws]] imposed by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government.\n\nBergson inclined to convert to Catholicism, writing in his will on 7 February 1937: \"My thinking has always brought me nearer to Catholicism, in which I saw the perfect complement to Judaism.\"<ref>Quoted in: {{Cite book\n|last= Zolli\n|first= Eugenio\n|authorlink= Israel Zolli\n|title= Before the Dawn\n|trans-title=\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bq_Qp53ksMAC&pg=PA81&lr=&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q=Bergson&f=false\n|origyear= 1954\n|year= 2008\n|publisher= Ignatius Press\n|isbn= 978-1-58617-287-9\n|page= 89\n|chapterurl= \n}}\n</ref> Though wishing to convert to Catholicism, as stated in his will, he did not convert in view of the travails inflicted on the Jewish people by the rise of [[Nazism]] and [[anti-Semitism]] in Europe in the 1930s; he did not want to appear to want to leave the persecuted. On 3 January 1941 Bergson died in occupied Paris from bronchitis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/library/henri-bergson/biography/ |title=Henri Bergson \u2013 Philosopher \u2013 Biography |work=www.egs.edu |date=3 January 1941 |accessdate=17 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527113913/http://www.egs.edu/library/henri-bergson/biography/ |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nA Roman Catholic priest said prayers at his funeral per his request. Bergson is buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Garches, [[Hauts-de-Seine]].\n\n==Philosophy==\nBergson rejected what he saw as the overly mechanistic predominant view of causality (as expressed in, say, [[finalism]]). He argued that we must allow space for free will to unfold in an autonomous and unpredictable fashion. While Kant saw free will as something beyond time and space and therefore ultimately a matter of faith, Bergson attempted to redefine the modern conceptions of time, space, and causality in his concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|Duration]], making room for a tangible marriage of free will with causality. Seeing Duration as a mobile and fluid concept, Bergson argued that one cannot understand Duration through \"immobile\" analysis, but only through experiential, first-person [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Creativity===\nBergson considers the appearance of novelty as a result of pure undetermined creation, instead of as the predetermined result of mechanistic forces. His philosophy emphasises pure mobility, unforeseeable novelty, creativity and freedom; thus one can characterize his system as a [[process philosophy]]. It touches upon such topics as time and identity, [[free will]], perception, change, memory, consciousness, language, the [[foundation of mathematics]] and the limits of reason.<ref>Bergson explores these topics in ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness'', in ''Matter and Memory'', in ''Creative Evolution'', and in ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics''.\n</ref>\n\nCriticizing [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s theory of knowledge exposed in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and his conception of truth \u2013 which he compares to [[Plato]]'s conception of truth as its symmetrical inversion (order of nature/order of thought) \u2013 Bergson attempted to redefine the relations between science and metaphysics, intelligence and [[intuition (Bergson)|intuition]], and insisted on the necessity of increasing thought's possibility through the use of intuition, which, according to him, alone approached a knowledge of the absolute and of real life, understood as pure [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]. Because of his (relative) criticism of intelligence, he makes a frequent use of images and metaphors in his writings in order to avoid the use of [[concept]]s, which (he considers) fail to touch the whole of reality, being only a sort of abstract net thrown on things. For instance, he says in ''The Creative Evolution'' (chap. III) that thought in itself would never have thought it possible for the human being to swim, as it cannot deduce swimming from walking. For swimming to be possible, man must throw itself in water, and only then can thought consider swimming as possible. Intelligence, for Bergson, is a practical faculty rather than a pure speculative faculty, a product of evolution used by man to survive. If metaphysics is to avoid \"false problems\", it should not extend the abstract concepts of intelligence to pure speculation, but rather use intuition.<ref>Elie During, ''[http://ciepfc.rhapsodyk.net/article.php3?id_article=63 \u00ab Fant\u00f4mes de probl\u00e8mes \u00bb]'', published by the ''[[Centre International d'Etudes de la Philosophie Fran\u00e7aise Contemporaine]]'' (short version first published in ''[[Le magazine litt\u00e9raire]]'', n\u00b0386, April 2000 (issue dedicated to Bergson)</ref>\n\n''The Creative Evolution'' in particular attempted to think through the continuous creation of life, and explicitly pitted itself against [[Herbert Spencer]]'s evolutionary philosophy. Spencer had attempted to transpose [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] in philosophy and to construct a [[cosmology]] based on this theory (Spencer also coined the expression \"[[survival of the fittest]]\"). Bergson disputed what he saw as Spencer's mechanistic philosophy.<ref>''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 11 to 14</ref>\n\nBergson's ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' ([[philosophy of life]]) can be seen as a response to the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic philosophies]] of his time,<ref name=\"Creative_Mind\">Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 11 to 13.</ref>  but also to the failure of [[finalism]].<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> Indeed, he considers that finalism is unable to explain \"duration\" and the \"continuous creation of life\", as it only explains life as the progressive development of an initially determined program \u2013 a notion which remains, for example, in the expression of a \"[[genetics|genetic]] program\";<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> such a description of finalism was adopted, for instance, by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> It clearly announces [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s.\n\nBergson regarded planning beforehand for the future as impossible, since time itself unravels unforeseen possibilities. Indeed, one could always explain a historical event retrospectively by its conditions of possibility. But, in the introduction to the ''Pens\u00e9e et le mouvant'', he explains that such an event created retrospectively its causes, taking the example of the creation of a work of art, for example a symphony: it was impossible to predict what would be the symphony of the future, as if the musician knew what symphony would be the best for his time, he would realize it. In his words, the effect created its cause. Henceforth, he attempted to find a third way between mechanism and finalism, through the notion of an original impulse, the ''\u00e9lan vital'', in life, which dispersed itself through evolution into contradictory tendencies (he substituted to the finalist notion of a [[teleological]] aim a notion of an original impulse).\n\n===Duration===\n{{See also|Duration (philosophy)}}\nThe foundation of Henri Bergson's philosophy, his theory of [[Duration (philosophy)|Duration]], he discovered when trying to improve the inadequacies of [[Herbert Spencer]]'s philosophy.<ref name=\"Creative_Mind\"/> Bergson introduced Duration as a theory of time and [[consciousness]] in his doctoral thesis ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness'' as a response to another of his influences: [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref name=\"Stanford_Kant\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''], \"Henri Bergson\": \"'Time and Free Will' has to be seen as an attack on Kant, for whom freedom belongs to a realm outside of space and time.\"</ref>\n\nKant believed that free will (better perceived as The Will) could only exist outside of time and space, indeed the only non-determined aspect of our private existence in the universe, separate to water cycles, mathematics and mortality. However, we could therefore not know whether or not it exists, and that it is nothing but a pragmatic faith.<ref name=\"Stanford_Kant\"/> Bergson responded that Kant, along with many other philosophers, had confused time with its spatial representation.<ref>Henri Bergson, ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness'', Author's Preface.</ref> In reality, Bergson argued, Duration is unextended yet heterogeneous, and so its parts cannot be juxtaposed as a succession of distinct parts, with one causing the other. Based on this he concluded that determinism is an impossibility and free will pure mobility, which is what Bergson identified as being the Duration.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''], \"Henri Bergson\": \"For Bergson \u2013 and perhaps this is his greatest insight \u2013 freedom is mobility.\"</ref>\n\n===Intuitionism===\n{{See also|Intuition (Bergson)}}\nDuration, as defined by Bergson, then is a unity and a multiplicity, but, being mobile, it cannot be grasped through immobile concepts. Bergson hence argues that one can grasp it only through his method of [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]]. Two images from Henri Bergson's ''An Introduction to Metaphysics'' may help one to grasp Bergson's term intuition, the limits of concepts, and the ability of intuition to grasp the absolute. The first image is that of a city. Analysis, or the creation of concepts through the divisions of points of view, can only ever give us a model of the city through a construction of photographs taken from every possible point of view, yet it can never give us the dimensional value of walking in the city itself. One can only grasp this through intuition; likewise the experience of reading a line of [[Homer]]. One may translate the line and pile commentary upon commentary, but this commentary too shall never grasp the simple dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its originality itself. The method of intuition, then, is that of getting back to the things themselves.<ref>Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 160 to 161. For a Whiteheadian use of Bergsonian intuition, see [[Michel Weber]]'s ''[https://www.academia.edu/279953/Whiteheads_Pancreativism._The_Basics Whitehead\u2019s Pancreativism. The Basics]''. Foreword by [[Nicholas Rescher]], Frankfurt / Paris, Ontos Verlag, 2006.\n</ref>\n\n===''\u00c9lan vital''===\n{{See also|\u00c9lan vital}}\n\n''\u00c9lan vital'' ranks as Bergson's third essential concept, after Duration and intuition. An idea with the goal of explaining evolution, the ''\u00e9lan vital'' first appeared in 1907's ''Creative Evolution''. Bergson portrays ''\u00e9lan vital'' as a kind of vital impetus which explains evolution in a less mechanical and more lively manner, as well as accounting for the creative impulse of mankind. This concept led several authors to characterize Bergson as a supporter of [[vitalism]]\u2014although he criticized it explicitly in ''The Creative Evolution'', as he thought, against [[Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch|Driesch]] and [[Johannes Reinke]] (whom he cited) that there is neither \"purely internal finality nor clearly cut individuality in nature\":<ref>''L'\u00c9volution cr\u00e9atrice'', pp. 42\u201344; pp. 226\u2013227</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Hereby lies the stumbling block of vitalist theories ... It is thus in vain that one pretends to reduce finality to the individuality of the living being. If there is finality in the world of life, it encompasses the whole of life in one indivisible embrace.<ref>''L'\u00c9volution cr\u00e9atrice'', pp. 42\u201343</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Laughter===\nIn ''[[Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic]]'', Bergson develops a theory not of laughter itself but of how laughter can be provoked (see his objection to Delage, published in the 23rd edition of the essay).<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> He describes the process of laughter (refusing to give a conceptual definition which would not approach its reality<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>), used in particular by comics and [[clown]]s, as caricature of the mechanistic nature of humans (habits, automatic acts, etc.), one of the two tendencies of life (degradation towards inert matter and mechanism, and continual creation of new forms).<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> However, Bergson warns us that laughter's criterion of what should be laughed at is not a moral criterion and that it can in fact cause serious damage to a person's [[self-esteem]].<ref>[http://www.timoroso.com/philosophy/writings/sketches/2006-04-09-henri-bergsons-theory-of-laughter Henri Bergson's theory of laughter]. A brief summary.</ref> This essay made his opposition to the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] theory of the animal-machine obvious.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>\n\n==Reception==\nFrom his first publications, Bergson's philosophy attracted strong criticism from different quarters, although he also became very popular and durably influenced [[French philosophy]].  The mathematician [[\u00c9douard Le Roy]] became Bergson's main disciple. Nonetheless, Suzanne Guerlac has argued that his institutional position at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, delivering lectures to a general audience, may have retarded the systematic reception of his thought: \"Bergson achieved enormous popular success in this context, often due to the emotional appeal of his ideas.  But he did not have the equivalent of graduate students who might have become rigorous interpreters of his thought.  Thus Bergson's philosophy\u2014in principle open and nonsystematic\u2014was easily borrowed piecemeal and altered by enthusiastic admirers\".<ref>Suzanne Guerlac, ''Thinking in Time: An Introduction to Henri Bergson'', Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2006, p. 10</ref>\n\n[[Alfred North Whitehead]] acknowledged Bergson's influence on his [[process philosophy]] in his 1929 ''[[Process and Reality]].''<ref>Cf.

Still others have characterized his philosophy as a [[emergent materialism|materialist emergentism]] \u2013 [[Samuel Alexander]] and [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] explicitly claimed Bergson as their forebear.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> According to Henri Hude (1990, II, p.&nbsp;142), who supports himself on the whole of Bergson's works as well as his now published courses, accusing him of pantheism is a \"counter-sense\". Hude alleges that a [[mysticism|mystical experience]], roughly outlined at the end of ''Les Deux sources de la morale et de la religion'', is the inner principle of his whole philosophy, although this has been contested by other commentators.\n\n[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] took strong exception to those who associated him with Bergson. In response to a letter comparing his work with that of Bergson he wrote, \"a man who seeks to further science can hardly commit a greater sin than to use the terms of his science without anxious care to use them with strict accuracy; it is not very gratifying to my feelings to be classed along with a Bergson who seems to be doing his utmost to muddle all distinctions.\" [[William James]]'s students resisted the assimilation of his work to that of Bergson. See, for example, [[Horace Kallen]]'s book on the subject ''James and Bergson''. As [[Jean Wahl]] described the \"ultimate disagreement\" between James and Bergson in his ''System of Metaphysics'': \"for James, the consideration of action is necessary for the definition of truth, according to Bergson, action ... must be kept from our mind if we want to see the truth\"{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}. Gide even went so far as to say that future historians will overestimate Bergson's influence on art and philosophy just because he was the self-appointed spokesman for \"the spirit of the age\".\n\nAs early as the 1890s, Santayana attacked certain key concepts in Bergson's philosophy, above all his view of the New and the indeterminate:\n\n<blockquote>the possibility of a new and unaccountable fact appearing at any time,\" he writes in his book on [[Hermann Lotze]], \"does not practically affect the method of investigation; ... the only thing given up is the hope that these hypotheses may ever be adequate to the reality and cover the process of nature without leaving a remainder. This is no great renunciation; for that consummation of science ... is by no one really expected.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Santayana and Russell, Bergson projected false claims onto the aspirations of scientific method, claims which Bergson needed to make in order to justify his prior moral commitment to freedom. Russell takes particular exception to Bergson's understanding of number in chapter two of ''Time and Free-will''. According to Russell, Bergson uses an outmoded spatial metaphor (\"extended images\") to describe the nature of mathematics as well as [[logic]] in general. \"Bergson only succeeds in making his theory of number possible by confusing a particular collection with the number of its terms, and this again with number in general\", writes Russell (see ''The Philosophy of Bergson''{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} and ''A History of Western Philosophy''{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}).\n\nFurthermore, writers such as Russell, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], and James saw ''\u00e9lan vital'' as a projection of subjectivity onto the world. The external world, according to certain{{Which|date=November 2009}} theories of [[probability]], provides less and less indeterminism with further refinement of scientific method. In brief, one should not confuse the moral, psychological, subjective demand for the new, the underivable and the unexplained with the universe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} One's subjective sense of duration differs the (non-human) world, a difference which, according to the ancient materialist [[Lucretius]] should not be characterized as either one of becoming or being, creation or destruction (''[[De Rerum Natura]]'').\n\n[[Suzanne Guerlac]] has argued that the more recent resurgence of scholarly interest in Bergson is related to the growing influence of his follower [[Deleuze]] within [[continental philosophy]]: \"If there is a return to Bergson today, then, it is largely due to Gilles Deleuze whose own work has etched the contours of the New Bergson.  This is not only because Deleuze wrote about Bergson; it is also because Deleuze's own thought is deeply engaged with that of his predecessor, even when Bergson is not explicitly mentioned.\"<ref>Suzanne Guerlac, ''Thinking in Time: An Introduction to Henri Bergson'', Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2006, p. 175.</ref> [[Leonard Lawlor]] and Valentine Moulard agree with Guerlac that \"the recent revitalization of Bergsonism ... is almost entirely due to Deleuze.\"  They explain that Bergson's concept of multiplicity \"is at the very heart of Deleuze's thought, and [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]] is the model for all of Deleuze's 'becomings.'  The other aspect that attracted Deleuze, which is indeed connected to the first, is Bergson's criticism of the concept of negation in Creative Evolution. ... Thus Bergson became a resource in the criticism of the [[Hegel]]ian [[Dialectic#Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]], the negative.\"<ref name=LawlorMoulard2011>{{citation |author=Leonard Lawlor and Valentine Moulard |chapter=The revitalization of Bergsonism |title=Henri Bergson |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |origyear= 18 May 2004|date= 12 July 2011 |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/#7 |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Comparison to Eastern philosophies===\nSeveral [[Hindu]] authors have found parallels to Hindu philosophy in Bergson's thought. The integrative evolutionism of [[Sri Aurobindo]], an Indian philosopher from the early 20th century, has many similarities to Bergson's philosophy. Whether this represents a direct influence of Bergson is disputed, although Aurobindo was familiar with many Western philosophers.<ref>K Mackenzie Brown. \"Hindu perspectives on evolution: Darwin, Dharma, and Design\".

He became a Doctor of Medicine and Chemistry in [[Prague]] in 1929, went to [[Johns Hopkins University]] on a [[Rockefeller|Rockefeller Foundation]] [[Scholarship]] in 1931 and then went to [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] where he started researching the issue of stress in 1936. In 1945, he joined the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] where he had 40 assistants and worked with 15,000 laboratory animals. [[Sachi Sri Kantha|Kantha]] (1992), in a survey of an elite group of scientists who have authored over 1,000 research publications, identified Selye as one who had published 1,700 research papers, 15 monographs, and 7 popular books. He died on 16 October 1982 in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. He was a nominee to the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prize]] for the first time in 1949.<ref>The Nomination Database for the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Physiology]] or [[Medicine]], 1901-1953</ref> He often visited Hungary, giving lectures as well as interviews in Hungarian television programs. His book \"The Stress of Life\" appeared in Hungarian as \"Az \u00c9let\u00fcnk \u00e9s a stressz\" in 1964 and becoming a bestseller.\n\nSelye was of [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] origin, his father was of Hungarian [[ethnicity]] while his mother was Austrian. His father a doctor moved back to Budapest with his Austrian wife. Selye's mother died in 1956 from bullet hits during the revolution.

He at first believed he had discovered a new hormone, but was proved wrong when every irritating substance he injected produced the same symptoms (swelling of the [[adrenal cortex]], atrophy of the [[thymus]], gastric and duodenal ulcers). This, paired with his observation that people with different diseases exhibit similar symptoms, led to his description of the effects of \"noxious agents\" as he at first called it. He later coined the term \"[[Stress (biology)|stress]]\", which has been accepted into the lexicon of most other languages. {{citation needed|reason=Selye later remarked that he actually meant \"strain\" but that his knowledge of English at the time was not precise enough.|date=January 2016}}\n\nSelye has acknowledged the influence of [[Claude Bernard]] (who developed the idea of ''[[milieu int\u00e9rieur]]'') and [[Walter Cannon]]'s \"[[homeostasis]]\". Selye conceptualized the physiology of stress as having two components: a set of responses which he called the \"[[general adaptation syndrome]]\", and the development of a pathological state from ongoing, unrelieved stress.\n\nSelye discovered and documented that stress differs from other physical responses in that stress is stressful whether one receives good or bad news, whether the impulse is positive or negative. He called negative stress \"[[Distress (medicine)|distress]]\" and positive stress \"[[eustress]]\". The system whereby the body copes with stress, the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) system, was also first described by Selye. He also pointed to an \"alarm state\", a \"resistance state\", and an \"exhaustion state\", largely referring to glandular states. Later he developed the idea of two \"reservoirs\" of stress resistance, or alternatively stress energy.\n\nSelye wrote ''The Stress of Life'' (1956), ''From Dream to Discovery: On Being a Scientist'' (1964) and ''Stress without Distress'' (1974). He worked as a professor and director of the Institute of Experimental Medicine and Surgery at the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]]. In 1975 he created the International Institute of Stress, and in 1979, Dr. Selye and Arthur Antille started the Hans Selye Foundation. Later Selye and eight Nobel laureates founded the Canadian Institute of Stress.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stresscanada.org |title=Welcome To The Canadian Institute Of Stress |publisher=Stresscanada.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 he was made a [[Companion of the Order of Canada]].

While \"hacker\" can refer to any skilled computer [[programmer]], the term has become associated in [[popular culture]] with a \"[[security hacker]]\", someone who, with their technical knowledge, uses [[bug (computing)|bugs]] or [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]] to break into computer systems.\n\n== Definitions ==\nReflecting the two types of hackers, there are two definitions of the word \"hacker\":\n\n# an adherent of the technology and programming subculture.\n# someone who is able to subvert [[computer security]]. If doing so for malicious purposes, the person can also be called a [[Security hacker|cracker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1983 |title= Internet Users' Glossary |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605204821/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1983 |archivedate=2016-06-05}}[[Request for Comments|RFC]] 1983</ref>\n\nToday, mainstream usage of \"hacker\" mostly refers to computer criminals, due to the mass media usage of the word since the 1980s. This includes what hacker slang calls \"[[script kiddie]]s\", people breaking into computers using programs written by others, with very little knowledge about the way they work. This usage has become so predominant that the general public is largely unaware that different meanings exist.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yagoda|first1=Ben|title=A Short History of \"Hack\"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-short-history-of-hack|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}</ref> While the self-designation of hobbyists as hackers is generally acknowledged and accepted by computer security hackers, people from the programming subculture consider the computer intrusion related usage incorrect, and emphasize the difference between the two by calling security breakers \"crackers\" (analogous to a safecracker).\n\nThe controversy is usually based on the assertion that the term originally meant someone messing about with something in a positive sense, that is, using playful cleverness to achieve a goal. But then, it is supposed, the meaning of the term shifted over the decades and came to refer to computer criminals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1392 |title= Internet Users' Glossary |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516153012/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1392 |archivedate=2016-05-16}}[[Request for Comments|RFC]] 1392</ref>\n\nAs the security-related usage has spread more widely, the original meaning has become less known. In popular usage and in the media, \"computer intruders\" or \"computer criminals\" is the exclusive meaning of the word today. (For example, \"An Internet 'hacker' broke through state government security systems in March.\") In the computer enthusiast (Hacker Culture) community, the primary meaning is a complimentary description for a particularly brilliant programmer or technical expert. (For example, \"[[Linus Torvalds]], the creator of [[Linux kernel|Linux]], is considered by some to be a hacker.\") A large segment of the technical community insist the latter is the \"correct\" usage of the word (see the [[Jargon File]] definition below).\n\nThe [[mainstream media]]'s current usage of the term may be traced back to the early 1980s. When the term was introduced to wider society by the mainstream media in 1983, even those in the computer community referred to computer intrusion as \"hacking\", although not as the exclusive definition of the word. In reaction to the increasing media use of the term exclusively with the criminal connotation, the computer community began to differentiate their terminology. Alternative terms such as \"[[Security cracking|cracker]]\" were coined in an effort to maintain the distinction between \"hackers\" within the legitimate programmer community and those performing computer break-ins. Further terms such as \"[[Black hat hacking|black hat]]\", \"[[White hat (computer security)|white hat]]\" and \"[[gray hat]]\" developed when laws against breaking into computers came into effect, to distinguish criminal activities from those activities which were legal.\n\nHowever, network news use of the term consistently pertained primarily to the criminal activities, despite the attempt by the technical community to preserve and distinguish the original meaning, so today the mainstream media and general public continue to describe computer criminals, with all levels of technical sophistication, as \"hackers\" and do not generally make use of the word in any of its non-criminal connotations. Members of the media sometimes seem unaware of the distinction, grouping legitimate \"hackers\" such as Linus Torvalds and [[Steve Wozniak]] along with criminal \"crackers\".<ref name=\"A who's who of hackers\">{{cite web|last=DuBois|first=Shelley|title=A who's who of hackers|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/06/16/a-whos-who-of-hackers/|work=Reporter|publisher=Fortune Magazine|accessdate=19 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, the definition is still the subject of heated controversy. The wider dominance of the pejorative connotation is resented by many who object to the term being taken from their cultural [[jargon]] and used negatively,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmrc.mit.edu/hackers-ref.html |title=TMRC site |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503072049/http://tmrc.mit.edu/hackers-ref.html |archivedate=2006-05-03}}</ref> including those who have historically preferred to self-identify as hackers. Many advocate using the more recent and nuanced alternate terms when describing criminals and others who negatively take advantage of security flaws in software and hardware. Others prefer to follow common popular usage, arguing that the positive form is confusing and unlikely to become widespread in the general public. A minority still use the term in both senses despite the controversy, leaving context to clarify (or leave ambiguous) which meaning is intended.\n\nHowever, because the positive definition of hacker was widely used as the predominant form for many years before the negative definition was popularized, \"hacker\" can therefore be seen as a [[shibboleth]], identifying those who use the technically-oriented sense (as opposed to the exclusively intrusion-oriented sense) as members of the computing community. On the other hand, due to the variety of industries software designers may find themselves in, many prefer not to be referred to as hackers because the word holds a negative denotation in many of those industries.\n\nA possible middle ground position has been suggested, based on the observation that \"hacking\" describes a collection of skills and tools which are used by hackers of both descriptions for differing reasons. The analogy is made to [[locksmithing]], specifically picking locks, which is a skill which can be used for good or evil. The primary weakness of this analogy is the inclusion of [[script kiddies]] in the popular usage of \"hacker,\" despite their lack of an underlying skill and knowledge base.\n\nSometimes, \"hacker\" is simply used synonymously with \"geek\": \"A true hacker is not a group person. He's a person who loves to stay up all night, he and the machine in a love-hate relationship... They're kids who tended to be brilliant but not very interested in conventional goals[...] It's a term of derision and also the ultimate compliment.\"<ref>[[Alan Kay]] quoted in [[Stewart Brand]], \"S P A C E W A R: Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death Among the Computer Bums:\" In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' (1972)</ref>\n\nFred Shapiro thinks that \"the common theory that 'hacker' originally was a benign term and the malicious connotations of the word were a later perversion is untrue.\" He found that the malicious connotations were already present at MIT in 1963 (quoting ''[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]'', an MIT student newspaper), and at that time referred to unauthorized users of the telephone network,<ref name=\"shapiro\">Fred Shapiro: [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0306B&L=ads-l&P=R5831&m=24290 Antedating of \"Hacker\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025200829/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0306B&L=ads-l&P=R5831&m=24290 |date=2007-10-25 }}.

White hats are usually employed by the target system's owner and are typically paid (sometimes quite well) for their work. Their work is not illegal because it is done with the system owner's consent.\n\n[[Black hat hacking|Black hat]]s or crackers are hackers with malicious intentions. They often steal, exploit, and sell data, and are usually motivated by personal gain. Their work is usually illegal. A cracker is like a black hat hacker,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pctools.com/security-news/crackers-and-hackers/|title=What are crackers and hackers? {{!}} Security News|website=www.pctools.com|access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref> but is specifically someone who is very skilled and tries via hacking to make profits or to benefit, not just to vandalize. Crackers find exploits for system vulnerabilities and often use them to their advantage by either selling the fix to the system owner or selling the exploit to other black hat hackers, who in turn use it to steal information or gain royalties.\n\n[[Grey hat]]s include those who hack for fun or to [[Internet troll|troll]]. They may both fix and exploit vulnerabilities, but usually not for financial gain.  Even if not malicious, their work can still be illegal, if done without the target system owner's consent, and grey hats are usually associated with [[black hat]] hackers.\n\n== Motives ==\n\nFour primary motives have been proposed as possibilities for why hackers attempt to break into computers and networks. First, there is a criminal financial gain to be had when hacking systems with the specific purpose of stealing [[credit card number]]s or manipulating [[banking system]]s. Second, many hackers thrive off of increasing their reputation within the hacker subculture and will leave their handles on websites they defaced or leave some other evidence as proof that they were involved in a specific hack. Third, corporate espionage allows companies to acquire information on products or services that can be stolen or used as leverage within the marketplace. And fourth, state-sponsored attacks provide nation states with both wartime and intelligence collection options conducted on, in, or through [[cyberspace]].<ref>Lloyd, Gene. \"Developing Algorithms to Identify Spoofed Internet Traffic\". Colorado Technical University, 2014</ref>\n\n== Overlaps and differences ==\nThe main basic difference between programmer subculture and computer security hacker is their mostly separate historical origin and development. However, the ''Jargon File'' reports that considerable overlap existed for the early phreaking at the beginning of the 1970s. An article from MIT's student paper ''The Tech'' used the term hacker in this context already in 1963 in its pejorative meaning for someone messing with the phone system.<ref name=shapiro/> The overlap quickly started to break when people joined in the activity who did it in a less responsible way.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/P/phreaking.html |title=phreaking |work=The Jargon Lexicon |publisher= |accessdate=2008-10-18}}</ref> This was the case after the publication of an article exposing the activities of Draper and Engressia.\n\nAccording to Raymond, hackers from the programmer subculture usually work openly and use their real name, while computer security hackers prefer secretive groups and identity-concealing aliases.<ref name=\"Raymond-cracker\" /> Also, their activities in practice are largely distinct. The former focus on creating new and improving existing infrastructure (especially the software environment they work with), while the latter primarily and strongly emphasize the general act of circumvention of security measures, with the effective use of the knowledge (which can be to report and help fixing the security bugs, or exploitation reasons) being only rather secondary. The most visible difference in these views was in the design of the MIT hackers' [[Incompatible Timesharing System]], which deliberately did not have any security measures.\n\nThere are some subtle overlaps, however, since basic knowledge about computer security is also common within the programmer subculture of hackers. For example, Ken Thompson noted during his 1983 [[Turing Award]] lecture that it is possible to add code to the [[UNIX]] \"login\" command that would accept either the intended encrypted [[password]] or a particular known password, allowing a backdoor into the system with the latter password. He named his invention the \"[[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]]\". Furthermore, Thompson argued, the [[Compiler|C compiler]] itself could be modified to automatically generate the rogue code, to make detecting the modification even harder. Because the compiler is itself a program generated from a compiler, the Trojan horse could also be automatically installed in a new compiler program, without any detectable modification to the source of the new compiler. However, Thompson disassociated himself strictly from the computer security hackers: \"I would like to criticize the press in its handling of the 'hackers,' the [[The 414s|414 gang]], the Dalton gang, etc. The acts performed by these kids are vandalism at best and probably trespass and theft at worst. ... I have watched kids testifying before Congress. It is clear that they are completely unaware of the seriousness of their acts.\"<ref>{{cite journal|first=Ken|last=Thompson|title=Reflections on Trusting Trust|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=27|issue=8|date=August 1984|format=PDF|url=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf|doi=10.1145/358198.358210|page=761}}</ref>\n\nThe programmer subculture of hackers sees secondary circumvention of security mechanisms as legitimate if it is done to get practical barriers out of the way for doing actual work. In special forms, that can even be an expression of playful cleverness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/rms-hack.html |title=The Hacker Community and Ethics: An Interview with Richard M. Stallman |publisher=GNU Project |author=Richard Stallman |year=2002 |accessdate=2008-10-18}}</ref> However, the systematic and primary engagement in such activities is not one of the actual interests of the programmer subculture of hackers and it does not have significance in its actual activities, either.<ref name=\"Raymond-cracker\">{{cite book|url=http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/C/cracker.html |title=cracker |work=The Jargon Lexicon |publisher= |accessdate=2008-10-18}}</ref> A further difference is that, historically, members of the programmer subculture of hackers were working at academic institutions and used the computing environment there. In contrast, the prototypical computer security hacker had access exclusively to a home computer and a modem. However, since the mid-1990s, with home computers that could run Unix-like operating systems and with inexpensive internet home access being available for the first time, many people from outside of the academic world started to take part in the programmer subculture of hacking.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, there are some overlaps in ideas and members with the computer security hacking community. The most prominent case is Robert T. Morris, who was a user of MIT-AI, yet wrote the [[Morris worm]]. The ''Jargon File'' hence calls him \"a true hacker who blundered\".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/pt03.html#bibliography |title=Part III. Appendices |work=The Jargon Lexicon |publisher= |accessdate=2008-10-18}}</ref> Nevertheless, members of the programmer subculture have a tendency to look down on and disassociate from these overlaps. They commonly refer disparagingly to people in the computer security subculture as crackers and refuse to accept any definition of hacker that encompasses such activities. The computer security hacking subculture, on the other hand, tends not to distinguish between the two subcultures as harshly, acknowledging that they have much in common including many members, political and social goals, and a love of learning about technology. They restrict the use of the term cracker to their categories of [[script kiddie]]s and black hat hackers instead.\n\nAll three subcultures have relations to hardware modifications. In the early days of network hacking, phreaks were building [[blue box]]es and various variants. The programmer subculture of hackers has stories about several hardware hacks in its folklore, such as a mysterious 'magic' switch attached to a PDP-10 computer in MIT's AI lab, that when turned off, crashed the computer.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/magic-story.html |title=A Story About \u2018Magic' |work=The Jargon Lexicon |publisher= |accessdate=2008-10-18}}</ref> The early hobbyist hackers built their home computers themselves, from construction kits. However, all these activities have died out during the 1980s, when the phone network switched to digitally controlled switchboards, causing network hacking to shift to dialing remote computers with modems, when pre-assembled inexpensive home computers were available, and when academic institutions started to give individual mass-produced workstation computers to scientists instead of using a central timesharing system. The only kind of widespread hardware modification nowadays is [[case modding]].\n\nAn encounter of the programmer and the computer security hacker subculture occurred at the end of the 1980s, when a group of computer security hackers, sympathizing with the [[Chaos Computer Club]] (which disclaimed any knowledge in these activities), broke into computers of American military organizations and academic institutions. They sold data from these machines to the Soviet secret service, one of them in order to fund his drug addiction. The case was solved when [[Clifford Stoll]], a scientist working as a system administrator, found ways to log the attacks and to trace them back (with the help of many others). ''[[23 (film)|23]]'', a German film adaption with fictional elements, shows the events from the attackers' perspective. Stoll described the case in his book ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg]]'' and in the TV documentary ''The KGB, the Computer, and Me'' from the other perspective. According to Eric S. Raymond, it \"nicely illustrates the difference between 'hacker' and 'cracker'. Stoll's portrait of himself, his lady Martha, and his friends at Berkeley and on the Internet paints a marvelously vivid picture of how hackers and the people around them like to live and how they think.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/pt03.html |title=Part III.

He guided the ship up the [[tributary]] [[Lualaba River]] to the trading company's innermost station, [[Kindu]], in [[Maniema|Eastern Kongo]].

Thus described, the subject seems comic, but isn't.<ref>{{harvnb|Karl|Davies|1986|p=407}}</ref> The tale was first published as a three-part serial, February, March and April 1899, in ''Blackwood's Magazine'' (February 1899 was the magazine's 1000th issue: special edition). Then later, in 1902, ''Heart of Darkness'' was included in the book ''[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories|Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories]]'' (published on 13 November 1902, by [[William Blackwood]]).\n\nThe volume consisted of ''[[Youth (Conrad story)|Youth: a Narrative]]'', ''Heart of Darkness'' and ''The End of the Tether'' in that order. For future editions of the book, in 1917 Conrad wrote an \"[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories/Author's Note|Author's Note]]\" where he, after denying any \"unity of artistic purpose\" underlying the collection, discusses each of the three stories, and makes light commentary on the character Marlow\u2014the narrator of the tales within the first two stories. He also mentions how ''Youth'' marks the first appearance of Marlow.\n\nOn 31 May 1902, in a letter to William Blackwood, Conrad remarked:\n\n<blockquote>I call your own kind self to witness ... the last pages of Heart of Darkness where the interview of the man and the girl locks in\u2014as it were\u2014the whole 30000 words of narrative description into one suggestive view of a whole phase of life and makes of that story something quite on another plane than an anecdote of a man who went mad in the Centre of Africa.<ref>{{harvnb|Karl|Davies|1986|p=417}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere have been many proposed sources for the character of the antagonist, Kurtz. [[Georges-Antoine Klein]], an agent who became ill and later died aboard Conrad's steamer, has been identified by scholars and literary critics as one basis for Kurtz.

As a child, Marlow had been fascinated by \"the blank spaces\" on maps, particularly by the biggest, which by the time he had grown up was no longer blank but turned into \"a place of darkness\" (Conrad 10). Yet there remained a big river, \"resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the land\" (Conrad 10). The image of this river on the map fascinated Marlow \"as a snake would a bird\" (Conrad 10). Feeling as though \"instead of going to the centre of a continent I were about to set off for the centre of the earth\", Marlow takes passage on a French steamer bound for the African coast and then into the interior (Conrad 18). After more than thirty days the ship anchors off the seat of the government near the mouth of the big river. Marlow, with still some two hundred miles to go, now takes passage on a little sea-going steamer captained by a Swede. He departs some thirty miles up the river where his Company's station is. Work on the railway is going on, involving removal of rocks with explosives. Marlow enters a narrow ravine to stroll in the shade under the trees, and finds himself in \"the gloomy circle of some Inferno\": the place is full of diseased Africans who worked on the railroad and now await their deaths, their sickened bodies already as thin as air (Conrad 24\u201325). Marlow witnesses the scene \"horror-struck\" (Conrad 26).\n\nMarlow has to wait for ten days in the Company's Outer Station, where he sleeps in a hut. At this station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation, he meets the Company's impeccably dressed chief accountant who tells him of a [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Mr. Kurtz]], who is in charge of a very important trading-post, and a widely respected, first-class agent, a \"'very remarkable person'\" who \"'Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together'\" (Conrad 28). The agent predicts that Kurtz will go very far: \"'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above\u2014the Council in Europe, you know\u2014mean him to be'\" (Conrad 29).\n\n[[File:VingtAnnees 289.jpg|thumb|Belgian river station on the Congo River, 1889]]\n\nMarlow departs with a caravan of sixty men to travel on foot some two hundred miles into the wilderness to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he is to captain is based. On the fifteenth day of his march, he arrives at the station, which has some twenty employees, and is shocked to learn from a fellow European that his steamboat had been wrecked in a mysterious accident two days earlier. He meets the general manager, who informs him that he could wait no longer for Marlow to arrive, because the up-river stations had to be relieved, and rumours had one important station in jeopardy because its chief, the exceptional Mr. Kurtz, was ill. \"Hang Kurtz\", Marlow thinks, irritated (Conrad 34). He fishes his boat out of the river and is occupied with its repair for some months, during which a sudden fire destroys a grass shed full of materials used to trade with the natives. While one of the natives is tortured for allegedly causing the fire, Marlow is invited in the room of the station's brick-maker, a man who spent a year waiting for material to make bricks. Marlow gets the impression the man wants to pump him, and is curious to know what kind of information he is after. Hanging on the wall is \"a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a lighted torch\" (Conrad 39). Marlow is fascinated with the sinister effect of the torchlight upon the woman's face, and is informed that Mr. Kurtz made the painting in the station a year ago. The brick-maker calls Kurtz \"'a prodigy'\" and \"'an emissary of pity, and science, and progress'\", and feels Kurtz represents the \"'higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose'\" needed for the cause Europe entrusts the Company with (Conrad 39). The man predicts Kurtz will rise in the hierarchy within two years and then makes the connection to Marlow: \"'The same people who sent him specially also recommended you'\" (Conrad 39\u201340).\n\nMarlow is frustrated by the months it takes to perform the necessary repairs, made all the slower by the lack of proper tools and replacement parts at the station. During this time, he learns that Kurtz is far from admired, but more or less resented (mostly by the manager).\n\nOnce underway, the journey up-river to Kurtz's station takes two months to the day. The steamboat stops briefly near an abandoned hut on the riverbank, where Marlow finds a pile of wood and a note indicating that the wood is for them and that they should proceed quickly but with caution as they near the Inner Station.\n\n[[File:VingtAnnees 286.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The ''Roi des Belges'' (\"King of the Belgians\"\u2014French), the Belgian riverboat Conrad commanded on the upper Congo, 1889]]\nThe journey pauses for the night about eight miles below the Inner Station. In the morning the crew awakens to find that the boat is enveloped by a thick white fog. From the riverbank they hear a very loud cry, followed by a discordant clamour. A few hours later, as safe navigation becomes increasingly difficult, the steamboat is attacked with a barrage of small arrows from the forest. The helmsman is impaled by a spear and falls at Marlow's feet. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers and causing the shower of arrows to cease. Marlow and a pilgrim (Marlow's word for the European hangers-on in the steamer) watch the helmsman die. In a flash forward, Marlow notes that the [[International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs]] had commissioned Kurtz to write a report, which he did eloquently. A handwritten postscript, apparently added later by Kurtz, reads \"Exterminate all the brutes!\" (Conrad 83).\n\nAt Kurtz's station Marlow sees a man on the riverbank waving his arm, urging them to land. The pilgrims, heavily armed, escort the manager on to the shore to retrieve Mr. Kurtz. The man from the bank boards the steamboat, and turns out to be a Russian wanderer who had happened to stray into Kurtz's camp. He explains that he had left the wood and the note at the abandoned hut. Through conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz can be; how the natives worship him; and how very ill he has been of late. The Russian admires Kurtz for his intellect and his insights into love, life, and justice, and suggests that he is a poet. He tells of how Kurtz opened his mind, and seems to admire him even for his power\u2014and for his willingness to use it. Marlow, on the other hand, suggests that Kurtz has gone mad.\n\nFrom the steamboat, Marlow observes the station in detail and is surprised to see near the station house a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, the manager appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz on an improvised stretcher. The area fills with natives, apparently ready for battle, but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher, and the natives retreat into the forest. The pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins, where he and the manager have a private conversation. Marlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer. When the manager exits the cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the Company's business in the region, that his methods are \"unsound\". Later, the Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the Company wants to remove him from the station and kill him, and Marlow confirms that hangings had been discussed.\n\n[[File:LeonRom.jpg|thumb|upright|[[L\u00e9on Rom]], photographed {{circa}} 1880, who some have argued served as the inspiration for Kurtz]]\nAfter midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin on the steamer and returned to shore. He goes ashore and finds a very weak Kurtz crawling his way back to the station house, though not too weak to call to the natives for help. Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm, but Kurtz only laments that he had not accomplished more in the region. The next day they prepare for their journey back down the river. The natives, including the ornately dressed woman, once again assemble on shore and begin to shout unintelligibly. Noticing the pilgrims readying their rifles, Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly to scatter the crowd of natives. Only the woman remains unmoved, with outstretched arms. The pilgrims open fire as the current carries them swiftly downstream.\n\nKurtz's health worsens on the return trip, and Marlow himself becomes increasingly ill. The steamboat breaks down and, while it is stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them away from the manager. When Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; as he dies, Marlow hears him weakly whisper: \"The horror! The horror!\" (Conrad 116). A short while later, the \"manager's boy\" announces to the rest of the crew, in a scathing tone, \"Mistah Kurtz\u2014he dead\" (Conrad 117). The next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury \"something\" in a muddy hole (Conrad 117). He falls very ill, himself near death.\n\nUpon his return to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the \"civilised\" world. Many callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz had entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in. He then gives Kurtz's report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit. Finally Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz's fianc\u00e9e, whom Kurtz referred to as \"My Intended\" (Conrad 79). When Marlow visits her, she is dressed in black and still deep in mourning, although it has been more than a year since Kurtz's death. She presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz's final words. Uncomfortable, Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz's final word was her name.\n\n==Reception==\nLiterary critic [[Harold Bloom]] wrote that ''Heart of Darkness'' had been analysed more than any other work of literature that is studied in universities and colleges, which he attributed to Conrad's \"unique propensity for ambiguity\".

In 1939 Welles adapted the story for his first film for [[RKO Pictures]], writing a screenplay with [[John Houseman]]. It was intended to be entirely filmed as a POV from Marlow's eyes. Welles even filmed a short presentation film illustrating his intent. It has been reported as lost to history. The project was never realised; one reason given was the loss of European markets after the outbreak of war. Welles still hoped to produce the film when he presented another radio adaptation of the story as his first program as producer-star of the CBS radio series ''[[This Is My Best]]''. Welles scholar [[Bret Wood]] called the broadcast of 13 March 1945, \"the closest representation of the film Welles might have made, crippled, of course, by the absence of the story's visual elements (which were so meticulously designed) and the half-hour length of the broadcast.\"<ref name=\"Bret Wood\">[[Bret Wood|Wood, Bret]], ''Orson Welles: A Bio-Bibliography''.

For example, Advaita Vedanta holds that after attaining moksha a person knows their \"soul, self\" and identifies it as one with Brahman and everyone in all respects.<ref name=karlpotter/><ref name=klausklost/> The followers of [[Dvaita]] (dualistic) schools, in moksha state, identify individual \"soul, self\" as distinct from Brahman but infinitesimally close, and after attaining moksha expect to spend eternity in a [[loka]] (heaven). To theistic schools of Hinduism, moksha is liberation from samsara, while for other schools such as the monistic school, moksha is possible in current life and is a psychological concept. According to Deutsche, moksha is transcendental consciousness to the latter, the perfect state of being, of self-realization, of freedom and of \"realizing the whole universe as the Self\".<ref name=\"E.

Yoga is a Hindu discipline which trains the body, mind and consciousness for health, tranquility and spiritual insight. This is done through a system of postures and exercises to practise control of the body and mind.<ref>Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses \u2013 Page 178, Suresh Chandra \u2013 1998</ref> Texts dedicated to Yoga include the [[Yoga Sutras]], the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and, as their philosophical and historical basis, the Upanishads. Yoga is means, and the four major ''marga'' (paths) discussed in Hinduism are: [[Bhakti Yoga]] (the path of love and devotion), [[Karma Yoga]] (the path of right action), [[R\u0101ja Yoga]] (the path of meditation), [[J\u00f1\u0101na Yoga]] (the path of wisdom)<ref name=bhaskaressentgeneral>{{Harvnb|Bhaskarananda|1994}}</ref> An individual may prefer one or some yogas over others, according to his or her inclination and understanding.

The purpose of a help desk is usually to [[troubleshoot]] problems or provide guidance about products such as computers, electronic equipment, food, apparel, or software. Corporations usually provide help desk support to their customers through various channels such as toll-free numbers, websites, instant messaging, or email. There are also in-house help desks designed to provide assistance to employees.\n\n==Functions==\n{{one source|section|date=June 2012}}\nA typical help desk can effectively perform several functions. It provides a single (or multiple) [[point of contact]] for users to gain assistance in troubleshooting, get answers to questions, and solve known problems. A help desk generally manages its requests through the use of software such as [[issue tracking system]]s. These systems often involve the use of a \"local bug tracker\" (LBT). This system allows the help desk to track and sort user requests with the help of a unique number, and can frequently classify problems by user, computer program, or similar categories. Many software applications are available to support the help desk function. Some target the [[enterprise software|enterprise level]] help desk and some target departmental needs. Help Desk able to handling and prioritize all escalate tickets and requests.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, research by Iain Middleton of [[Robert Gordon University]]<ref>Middleton, I ''\"Key Factors in Help Desk Success (An analysis of areas critical to help desk development and functionality.)\"'' British Library R&D Report 6247, The British Library 1996</ref> studied the value of an organization's help desks. It found that value was derived not only from a reactive response to user issues, but also from the help desk's unique position of communicating daily with numerous customers or employees. Information gained in areas such as technical problems, user preferences, and satisfaction can be valuable for the planning and development work of other information technology units.\n\n==Organization==\n{{one source|section|date=June 2012}}\nLarge help desks<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/smb/ebusiness/230800044 |title=IT Help Desks Not Just For Large Enterprises }}</ref> are often structured into different levels to handle different types of questions. For example, a first-level help desk may be prepared to answer the questions or provide the information commonly found among the [[FAQ]] or in a [[knowledge base]]. If the issue is not resolved at the first level, it can be forwarded to a second level with resources to handle more complex issues. Organizations may also have a third line of support to deal with software-specific needs, such as updates and bug fixes that directly affect a specific client.\n\nLarge help desks have a person or team responsible for managing the incoming requests, called \"issues\"; they are commonly called queue managers or queue supervisors. The queue manager is responsible for the issue [[Queue area|queues]], which can be set up in various ways depending on the help desk size or structure. Typically, large help desks have several teams that are experienced in working on different issues. The queue manager will assign an issue to one of the specialized teams based on the type of issue raised. Some help desks may have telephone systems with [[Automatic call distributor|ACD splits]] ensuring that calls about specific topics are put through to analysts with the requisite experience or knowledge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.calvin.edu/it/about/student_jobs/HelpDesk+Technician.pdf|title=Students - Information technology - Calvin College|author=|date=|website=Calvin College|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nA large number of these help desks have strict rosters. Time is set aside for analysts to perform tasks such as following up on problems, returning phone calls, and answering questions via email. This roster system ensures that all analysts have enough time to follow up on calls and also ensures that analysts are always available to take incoming phone calls. As the incoming phone calls are random in nature, help desk agent schedules are often maintained using an [[Erlang unit#Erlang C|Erlang C]] calculation.\n\n===Desk side team===\nThe desk side team (sometimes known as \"desktop support\") is responsible for issues related to [[desktop computer|desktops]], [[laptop]]s, and [[computer peripheral|peripherals]], such as [[personal digital assistant]]s. The help desk assigns the desktop team the second-level desk side issues that the first level was not able to solve. They set up and [[computer configuration|configure]] computers for new users and are typically responsible for any physical work relating to the computers, such as repairing software or computer hardware issues and moving [[workstation]]s to another location.\n\n===Network team===\nThe [[computer network|network]] team is responsible for the network software, hardware and infrastructure, such as [[Server (computing)|server]]s, [[switch]]es, [[backup]] systems, and [[firewall (networking)|firewalls]]. They are also responsible for the network services, such as email configuration, file management, and [[computer security|security]] issues. The help desk assigns the network team issues that are in their field of responsibility. Networks often have proprietary or open source monitoring devices that forward outage information to help desk systems so that tickets may be automatically opened and primary contacts paged.\n\n===Server team===\nThe server team is responsible for most or all of the servers within the organization. This includes network authentication, network shares, network resources, email accounts, and all aspects of server software. It may also include more advanced services such as those related to databases, storage or content management systems, specialized proprietary services, and other industry-specific server-based applications.\n\n===Other teams===\nSome companies have a [[telecommunication|telecom]] team that is responsible for telephone infrastructure such as [[Private branch exchange|PBX]], [[voicemail]], [[VOIP]], telephone sets, [[modems]], and [[fax machines]]. They are responsible for configuring and moving telephone numbers, voicemail setup and configuration, having been assigned these types of issues by the help desk.\n\nCompanies with custom [[application software]] may also have an applications team who are responsible for the development of in-house software. The help desk may assign to the applications team such problems as finding [[software bug]]s. Requests for new features or information about the capabilities of in-house software that come through the help desk are also assigned to applications groups.\n\nThe help desk staff and supporting [[information technology|IT]] staff may not all work from the same location. With [[Remote Assistance Software|remote access applications]], technicians are able to solve many help desk issues from another work location or their home office.

He was born in [[Thonon-les-Bains]], [[Haute-Savoie]]. His grandfather was a magistrate and his father served on the [[Chamb\u00e9ry]] bar. During his early life, he relocated between Savoy and Paris and the tensions between provincial and city life influenced his writings. In his professional life he observed closely the dissolution of numerous families and analysed the causes and consequences of these. From the age of seventeen he spent three years in Paris studying law. Then he returned to practice law in Savoy. He returned to Paris after the publication of his first book during 1894. When his father died in 1896 he returned to Savoy.\n\nThe writings of Bordeaux reflect the values of traditional provincial Catholic communities. One recurring theme is loyalty. Loyalty is pervasive, and it applies to family, country and God. This theme is particularly evidenced in the novels \"La Peur de vivre\" and \"Les Roquevillard.\"\n\nBordeaux was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] on 22 May 1919. This elite group of writers, popularly known as the \"immortals,\" are responsible for establishing and maintaining the grammar, usage and acceptance of vocabulary into standard French.\n\nHe was a contributor to ''Le Visage de l'Italie'', a 1929 book about Italy prefaced by [[Benito Mussolini]].<ref name=\"worldcatlevisagedelitalie\">{{cite web|title=Le Visage de l'Italie, publi\u00e9 sous la direction litt\u00e9raire de Gabriel Faure.

Additionally, he holds a significant place in the history of law enforcement, having used his authority as a [[magistrate]] to found (with his half-brother [[John Fielding|John]]) what some have called [[London]]'s first police force, the [[Bow Street Runners]].

''[[The Tragedy of Tragedies]]'' (for which [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] designed the frontispiece) was, for example, quite successful as a printed play. He also contributed a number of works to journals of the day. \n\nFrom 1734 until 1739 he wrote anonymously for the leading [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] periodical, ''The Craftsman'', against the Prime Minister, Sir [[Robert Walpole]].<ref>Martin C.

Lyttelton followed his leader [[Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham|Lord Cobham]] in forming a Whig opposition to Walpole's government, called the [[Cobhamites]] (who also included Fielding's other Eton friend, William Pitt).<ref>Battestin, p. xx.</ref> In the ''Craftsman'', Fielding articulated the opposition's attack on bribery and corruption in British politics.<ref>Battestin, p. xiii.</ref> Although writing for the opposition to Walpole that included Tories as well as Whigs, Fielding was \"unshakably a Whig\" and often praised Whig heroes such as the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>Battestin, p. 61.</ref>\n\nFielding dedicated his play ''Don Quixote in England'' to the opposition Whig leader [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] and it was published on 17 April 1734, the same day writs were issued for the [[British general election, 1734|general election]].<ref>Battestin, p. xxiii.</ref> He dedicated his 1735 play ''The Universal Gallant'' to [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough]], a political follower of Chesterfield.<ref>Battestin, p. xxv.</ref> The other prominent opposition newspaper, ''Common Sense'', was named after a character in Fielding's ''Pasquin'' (1736) and was founded by Chesterfield and Lyttelton.

His first big success was an anonymous parody of that book: ''[[An Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews|Shamela]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Sham Marriages and Proper Plots: Henry Fielding's Shamela and Joseph Andrews|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0013838X.2015.1045728|journal = English Studies |date = 18 August 2015|issn = 0013-838X |pages = 636\u201353|volume = 96 |issue = 6 |doi = 10.1080/0013838X.2015.1045728 |first = Anaclara |last = Castro-Santana}}</ref> This satire follows the model of the famous Tory satirists of the previous generation, [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[John Gay]], in particular.\n\nFielding followed this with ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' (1742), an original work supposedly dealing with Pamela's brother, Joseph.<ref name=\"dorset\"/> His purpose in this book, however, was more than parody, for he intended, as he announced in the preface, a \"kind of writing which I do not remember to have seen hithereto attempted in our language.\" In this new kind of writing, which Fielding called a \"comic epic poem in prouse,\" he creatively blended two classical traditions: that of the epic, which had been poetic, and that of the drama, but emphasizing the comic rather than the tragic. Another distinction of ''Joseph Andrews'' and of the novels to come was the use of everyday reality of character and action as opposed to the fables of the past.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/henry-fielding|title=Henry Fielding Facts|website=biography.yourdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=4 May 2017}}</ref> Although begun as a parody, it developed into an accomplished novel in its own right and is considered to mark Fielding's debut as a serious novelist. In 1743, he published a novel in the ''Miscellanies'' volume III (which was the first volume of the Miscellanies): ''[[The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great]]'', which is sometimes counted as his first, as he almost certainly began it before he wrote ''Shamela'' and ''Joseph Andrews''. It is a satire of Walpole that draws a parallel between him and [[Jonathan Wild]], the infamous gang leader and highwayman. He implicitly compares the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] party in [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] with a gang of thieves being run by Walpole, whose constant desire to be a \"Great Man\" (a common epithet for Walpole) ought to culminate in the antithesis of greatness: being hanged.\n\n{{listen\n|filename=Roast Beef of England.ogg\n|title=The Roast Beef of Old England\n|description= Henry Fielding wrote \"The Roast Beef of Old England\", which is used by both the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]], in 1731.

The plot of Tom Jones is too ingeniously complicated for simple summary; its basis is Tom's alienation from his foster father, Squire Allworthy, and his sweetheart, Sophia Western, and his reconciliation with them after lively and dangerous adventures on the road and in London. The triumph of the book is its presentation of English life and character in the mid-18th century. Every social type is represented, and through them every shade of moral behavior. Fielding's varied style tempers the basic seriousness of the novel, and his authorial comment preceding each chapter adds a significant dimension to the conventionally straightforward narrative.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/henry-fielding|title=Henry Fielding Facts|website=biography.yourdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Marriages==\nFielding married Charlotte Craddock in 1734 at the [[Church of St Mary, Charlcombe|Church of St Mary]] in [[Charlcombe]], [[Somerset]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Henry Fielding (I1744) |url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I1744&ged=auden-bicknell.ged |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref> She died in 1744, and he later modelled the heroines of both ''Tom Jones'' and ''Amelia'' on her.

From there, we can trace two basic lines of protection against hate-motivated incidents: one passes through criminal law, the other through civil law.\nThe current Czech criminal legislation has implications both for decisions about guilt (affecting the decision whether to find a defendant guilty or not guilty) and decisions concerning sentencing (affecting the extent of the punishment imposed). It has '''three levels''', to wit:\n* a '''circumstance determining whether an act is a crime''' \u2013 hate motivation is included in the basic constituent elements. If hate motivation is not proven, conviction for a hate crime is not possible.\n* a '''circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty''' \u2013 a hate motivation is included in the qualified constituent elements for some types of crimes (murder, bodily harm). If hate motivation is not proven, the penalty is imposed according to the scale specified for the basic constituent elements of the crime.\n* '''general aggravating circumstance''' \u2013 the court is obligated to take the hate motivation into account as a general aggravating circumstance and determines the amount of penalty to impose. Nevertheless, it is not possible to add together a general aggravating circumstance and a circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty. (see Annex for details)\nCurrent criminal legislation '''does not provide for special penalties''' for acts that target another by reason of his '''sexual orientation, age or health status'''. Only the constituent elements of the criminal offense of Incitement to hatred towards a group of persons or to the curtailment of their rights and freedoms, and general aggravating circumstances include attacking a so-called different group of people. Such a group of people can then, of course, be also one defined by sexual orientation, age or health status. A certain disparity has thus been created between, on the one hand, those groups of people who are victimized by reason of their skin color, faith, nationality, ethnicity or political persuasion and enjoy increased protection, and, on the other hand, those groups that are victimized by reason of their sexual orientation, age or health status and are not granted increased protection. This gap in protection against attacks motivated by the victim's sexual orientation, age or health status cannot be successfully bridged by interpretation. Interpretation by analogy is inadmissible in criminal law, sanctionable motivations being exhaustively enumerated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in-ius.cz/dwn/zprava-o-nzn2011/report-web.pdf |title=Zpr\u00e1va o n\u00e1sil\u00ed z nen\u00e1visti v \u010cesk\u00e9 republice za rok 2011 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}</ref>\n\n====Denmark====\nAlthough [[Denmark|Danish]] law does not include explicit hate crime provisions, \"section 80(1) of the Criminal Code instructs courts to take into account the gravity of the offence and the offender's motive when meting out penalty, and therefore to attach importance to the racist motive of crimes in determining sentence.\"<ref>ECRI, \u201cSecond Report on Denmark,\u201d adopted on June 16, 2000, and made public on April 3, 2001, para. 9.</ref> In recent years judges have used this provision to increase sentences on the basis of racist motives.<ref name=\"human\" /><ref>Chahrokh, Klug, and Bilger, Migrants, Minorities, and Legislation.</ref>\n\nSince 1992, the Danish Civil Security Service (PET) has released statistics on crimes with apparent racist motivation.<ref name=\"human\" />\n\n====Estonia====\nUnder section 151 of the Criminal Code of [[Estonia]] of 6 June 2001, which entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and as amended by the Law of 8 December 2011, \"activities which publicly incite to hatred, violence or discrimination on the basis of nationality, race, colour, sex, language, origin, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, or financial or social status, if this results in danger to the life, health or property of a person, are punishable by a fine of up to 300 fine units or by detention\".<ref>[http://www.legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/18762 Criminal Code of Estonia of 6 June 2001, entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and latest amendment by the Law of 8 December 2011, published in RT I, 29.12.2011, 1 and entered into force on 1 January 2012 (excerpts)], accessed 27 August 2017</ref>\n\n====Finland====\n[[Finland|Finnish]] [[Criminal Code of Finland|Criminal Code]] 515/2003 (enacted January 31, 2003) makes \"committing a crime against a person, because of his national, racial, ethnical or equivalent group\" an aggravating circumstance in sentencing.<ref name=\"human\" /><ref>EUMC, \u201cRacism and xenophobia in the E.U.,\u201d p. 51.</ref> In addition, ethnic agitation ({{lang-fi|kiihotus kansanryhm\u00e4\u00e4 vastaan}}) is criminalized and carries a fine or a prison sentence of not more than two years.

Jacobs]] and Kimberly Potter criticize hate crime legislation for exacerbating conflicts between groups.  They assert that by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another, rather than as being committed by individuals against their society, the labeling of crimes as \"hate crimes\" causes groups to feel persecuted by one another, and that this impression of persecution can incite a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] and thus lead to an actual increase in crime.<ref name=\"Jacobs, James B. 1998\">Jacobs, James B. & Kimberly Potter.

Following her husband's death in 1816, she remarried in 1818.<ref name=Rossel /> Andersen was sent to a local school for poor children where he received a basic education and had to support himself, working as an [[apprentice]] to a weaver and, later, to a tailor. At fourteen, he moved to [[Copenhagen]] to seek employment as an actor. Having an excellent soprano voice, he was accepted into the [[Royal Danish Theatre]], but his voice soon changed. A colleague at the theatre told him that he considered Andersen a poet. Taking the suggestion seriously, Andersen began to focus on writing.\n\n[[File:H.C. Andersens Barndomshjemmet2.JPG|thumb|left|Andersen's childhood home in Odense]]\nJonas Collin, director of the Royal Danish Theatre, held great affection for Andersen and sent him to a [[grammar school]] in [[Slagelse]], persuading [[Frederick VI of Denmark|King Frederick VI]] to pay part of the youth's education.<ref>[http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/cultural/hans-christian-andersen-281.html Hans Christian Andersen - Childhood and Education].

At one school, he lived at his schoolmaster's home, where he was abused, being told that it was \"to improve his character\".

Its protagonist meets characters ranging from [[Saint Peter]] to a talking cat. Andersen followed this success with a theatrical piece, ''Love on St. Nicholas Church Tower'', and a short volume of poems. Although he made little progress writing and publishing immediately thereafter, in 1833 he received a small travel grant from the king, thus enabling him to set out on the first of many journeys through Europe. At [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], near [[Le Locle]], Switzerland, Andersen wrote the story \"Agnete and the Merman\". He spent an evening in the Italian seaside village of [[Sestri Levante]] the same year, inspiring the title of \"The Bay of Fables\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andersenfestival.it |title=Andersen Festival, Sestri Levante|publisher=Andersen Festival|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> In October 1834, he arrived in [[Rome]].

Initially his original fairy tales were not met with recognition, due partly to the difficulty of translating them. In 1835, Andersen published the first two installments of his ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.|Fairy Tales]]'' ({{lang-da|Eventyr}}; lit. \"fantastic tales\"). More stories, completing the first volume, were published in 1837. The collection comprises nine tales, including \"[[The Tinderbox]]\", \"[[The Princess and the Pea]]\", \"[[Thumbelina]]\", \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\" and \"[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]\". The quality of these stories was not immediately recognized, and they sold poorly. At the same time, Andersen enjoyed more success with two novels, ''O.T.'' (1836) and ''Only a Fiddler'' (1837);<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/onlyfiddlerdanis00andeiala#page/n3/mode/2up ''Only a Fiddler''] from  Archive.org</ref> the latter work was reviewed by a young [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Much of his work was influenced by the Bible as when he was growing up Christianity was very important in the Danish culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/hans-christian-andersens-fairy-tales/0/steps/14184|title=Biblical themes in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales - Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s Fairy Tales - Hans Christian Andersen Centre|last=FutureLearn|website=FutureLearn|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-07}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Constantin Hansen 1836 - HC Andersen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Painting of Andersen, 1836, by [[Christian Albrecht Jensen]]]]\nAfter a visit to [[Sweden]] in 1837, Andersen became inspired by [[Scandinavism]] and committed himself to writing a poem that would convey the relatedness of [[Swedes]], [[Danes]] and [[Norwegians]].<ref name=\"Scandinavian\">{{cite web|work=Hans Christian Andersen and Music|url=http://www.kb.dk/elib/noder/hcamusik/skandinav/index_en.htm|title=I am a Scandinavian|accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> In July 1839, during a visit to the island of [[Funen]],  Andersen  wrote the text of his poem ''Jeg er en Skandinav'' (\"I am a Scandinavian\")<ref name=\"Scandinavian\"/> to capture \"the beauty of the Nordic spirit, the way the three sister nations have gradually grown together\" as part of a Scandinavian national anthem.<ref name=\"Scandinavian\"/> Composer [[Otto Lindblad]] set the poem to music, and the composition was published in January 1840. Its popularity peaked in 1845, after which it was seldom sung.<ref name=\"Scandinavian\"/>\n\nAndersen returned to the fairy tale genre in 1838 with another collection, ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children (1838)|Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. First Booklet]]'' ({{lang|da|Eventyr, fortalte for B\u00f8rn. Ny Samling}}), which consists of \"The Daisy\", \"[[The Steadfast Tin Soldier]]\", and \"[[The Wild Swans]]\".  He went on to publish \"[[New Fairy Tales (1844). First Volume. First Collection]]\", which contained \"[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]\" and \"[[The Ugly Duckling]]\".  After that came \"[[New Fairy Tales (1845). First Volume. Second Collection]]\" in which was found \"[[The Snow Queen]]\".  \"[[The Little Match Girl]]\" appeared in December 1845 in the \"[[Dansk Folkekalender (1846)]]\" and also in \"[[New Fairy Tales (1848). Second Volume. Second Collection]]\".\n\n1845 saw a breakthrough for Andersen with the publication of four  translations of his fairy tales. \"The Little Mermaid\" appeared in the periodical ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]'', followed by a second volume, ''Wonderful Stories for Children''. Two other volumes enthusiastically received were ''A Danish Story Book'' and ''Danish Fairy Tales and Legends''. A review that appeared in the London journal ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athen\u00e6um]]'' (February 1846) said of ''Wonderful Stories'', \"This is a book full of life and fancy; a book for grandfathers no less than grandchildren, not a word of which will be skipped by those who have it once in hand.\"<ref name=\"Wullschl\u00e4ger 2002\"/>\n\nAndersen would continue to write fairy tales and  published them in installments until 1872.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/who-was-hans-christian-andersen|title=Who Was Hans Christian Andersen?|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Travelogues===\nIn 1851, he published to wide acclaim ''In Sweden'', a volume of travel sketches. A keen traveller, Andersen published several other long [[travel literature|travelogues]]: ''Shadow Pictures of a Journey to the Harz, Swiss Saxony, etc. etc. in the Summer of 1831'', ''A Poet's Bazaar'', ''In Spain'' and ''A Visit to Portugal in 1866''. (The last describes his visit with his [[Portugal|Portuguese]] friends Jorge and Jose O'Neill, who were his fellows in the mid-1820s while living in Copenhagen.) In his travelogues, Andersen took heed of some of the contemporary conventions about travel writing, but always developed the genre to suit his own purposes. Each of his travelogues combines documentary and descriptive accounts of the sights he saw with more philosophical passages on topics such as being an author, immortality, and the nature of fiction in the literary travel report. Some of the travelogues, such as ''In Sweden'', even contain fairy-tales.\n\nIn the 1840s, Andersen's attention returned to the stage, but with little success. He had better fortune with the publication of the ''Picture-Book without Pictures'' (1840). A second series of fairy tales began in 1838 and a third in 1845. Andersen was now celebrated throughout Europe, although his native [[Denmark]] still showed some resistance to his pretensions.\n\nBetween 1845 and 1864, H. C. Andersen lived at 67 [[Nyhavn]], Copenhagen, where a memorial plaque now stands.<ref name=\"Official Tourism Site of Copenhagen\">{{cite web |url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/press/press_information/hans_christian_andersen/in_the_footsteps_of_andersen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725103354/http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/press/press_information/hans_christian_andersen/in_the_footsteps_of_andersen |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 July 2008 |title=Official Tourism Site of Copenhagen |publisher=Visitcopenhagen.com |date= |accessdate=2 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Meetings with Dickens===\nIn June 1847, Andersen paid his first visit to England and enjoyed a triumphal social success during the summer. The [[Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of Blessington|Countess of Blessington]] invited him to her parties where intellectual people could meet, and it was at one such party that he met [[Charles Dickens]] for the first time. They shook hands and walked to the veranda, about which Andersen wrote in his diary: \"We had come to the veranda, I was so happy to see and speak to England's now living writer, whom I love the most.\"<ref name=\"dickens\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hcandersen-homepage.dk/?page_id=3704 |title=H.C.

In the [[Victorian era]] there was a growing sympathy for children and an idealisation of the innocence of childhood.\n\nTen years later, Andersen visited England again, primarily to meet Dickens. He extended a brief visit to Dickens' home at [[Gads Hill Place]] into a five-week stay, to the distress of Dickens' family. After Andersen was told to leave, Dickens gradually stopped all correspondence between them, to the great disappointment and confusion of Andersen, who had quite enjoyed the visit and never understood why his letters went unanswered.<ref name=\"dickens\"/>\n\n===Love life===\n[[File:Hans Christian Andersen 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Franz Hanfstaengl|Hanfstaengl]] portrait of Andersen dated July 1860]]\nIn Andersen's early life, his private journal records his [[Celibacy|refusal to have sexual relations]].<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Lepage | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1689053,00.html | title = Bedtime stories | publisher = The Guardian | date =18 January 2006| accessdate = 19 July 2006 }}</ref><ref name=Garfield>Recorded using \"special Greek symbols\".{{cite web|url=http://www.patriciagarfield.com/publications/anderson_2004IASD.pdf |title=The Dreams of Hans Christian Andersen |date=21 June 2004 |accessdate=20 July 2006 |last=Garfield |first=Patricia |page=29 | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nAndersen often fell in love with unattainable women, and many of his stories are interpreted as references.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hastings|first=Waller|title=Hans Christian Andersen|url=http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|publisher=Northern State University|accessdate=15 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123053333/http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|archivedate=23 November 2007|date=4 April 2003}}</ref>  At one point, he wrote in his diary: \"Almighty God, thee only have I; thou steerest my fate, I must give myself up to thee!

A small pouch containing a long letter from Voigt was found on Andersen's chest when he died, several decades after he first fell in love with her, and after he supposedly fell in love with others. Other disappointments in love included Sophie \u00d8rsted, the daughter of the physicist [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] and Louise Collin, the youngest daughter of his benefactor Jonas Collin. One of his stories, \"[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]\", was written as an expression of his passion for [[Jenny Lind]] and became the inspiration for her nickname, the \"Swedish Nightingale\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://altomhistorie.dk/artikler/h-c-andersen-og-jenny-lind/|title=H.C.

C. Andersen Centre of [[University of Southern Denmark]], \"To conclude, it is correct to point to the very ambivalent (and also very traumatic) elements in Andersen's emotional life concerning the sexual sphere, but it is decidedly just as wrong to describe him as homosexual and maintain that he had physical relationships with men. He did not.

Set in [[Denmark]], the [[Play (theatre)|play]] dramatises the revenge [[Prince Hamlet]] is called to wreak upon his uncle, [[King Claudius|Claudius]], by the ghost of Hamlet's father, [[King Hamlet]]. Claudius had murdered his own brother and seized the [[throne]], also marrying his deceased brother's widow.\n\n''Hamlet'' is Shakespeare's longest play, and is considered among the most powerful and influential works of [[world literature]], with a story capable of \"seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others\".{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|p=74}} It was one of Shakespeare's most popular works during his lifetime,{{sfn|Taylor|2002|p=18}} and still ranks among his most performed, topping the performance list of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879.{{sfn|Crystal|Crystal|2005|p=66}} It has inspired many other writers\u2014from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Charles Dickens]] to [[James Joyce]] and [[Iris Murdoch]]\u2014and has been described as \"the world's most filmed story after ''[[Cinderella]]''\".{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|p=17}}\n\nThe story of Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'' was derived from the legend of [[Amleth]], preserved by 13th-century chronicler [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in his ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', as subsequently retold by the 16th-century scholar [[Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest]]. Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] play known today as the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]'', though some scholars believe he himself wrote the ''Ur-Hamlet'', later revising it to create the version of ''Hamlet'' we now have. He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor, [[Richard Burbage]], the leading tragedian of Shakespeare's time. In the 400 years since its inception, the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century.\n\nThree different early versions of the play are extant: the [[Hamlet Q1|First Quarto]] (Q1, 1603); the Second [[Quarto]] (Q2, 1604); and the [[First Folio]] (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others. The play's structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet's hesitation to kill his uncle, which some see as merely a [[plot device]] to prolong the action, but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, [[Psychoanalytic literary criticism|psychoanalytic critics]] have examined Hamlet's [[unconscious mind|unconscious desires]], while [[feminist literary criticism|feminist critics]] have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] and [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]].\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|Characters in Hamlet}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|rules=yes}}\n*[[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]\u2014Son of the late King and nephew of the present King, Claudius.\n*[[King Claudius|Claudius]]\u2014King of Denmark, Hamlet's uncle and brother to the former King\n*[[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]]\u2014Queen of Denmark and Hamlet's mother\n*[[Polonius]]\u2014Chief counsellor to the king\n*[[Ophelia]]\u2014Polonius's daughter\n*[[Horatio (Hamlet)|Horatio]]\u2014Friend to Hamlet\n*[[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]]\u2014Polonius's son\n*Voltimand and Cornelius\u2014Courtiers\n*[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]\u2014Courtiers, friends of Hamlet\n*Osric\u2014a Courtier\n*Marcellus\u2014an Officer\n*Barnardo\u2014an Officer\n*Francisco\u2014a Soldier\n*Reynaldo\u2014Polonius's servant\n*[[Ghost (Hamlet)|Ghost of Hamlet's Father]]\n*[[Fortinbras]]\u2014Prince of Norway\n*[[The Gravediggers|Gravediggers]]\u2014a [[Sexton (office)|Sexton]]\n*Player King, Player Queen, Lucianus etc.\u2014Players\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Act I===\nThe protagonist of ''Hamlet'' is [[Prince Hamlet]] of Denmark, son of the recently deceased [[King Hamlet]], and nephew of [[King Claudius]], his father's brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet's widow, [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]], Hamlet's mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouring Norway, in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway, and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras's infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king's son, Prince [[Fortinbras]], is imminent.\n\nOn a cold night on the ramparts of [[Kronborg Slot|Elsinore]], the Danish royal castle, the [[Characters in Hamlet#Elsinore sentries|sentries]] Bernardo and Marcellus discuss a [[Ghost (Hamlet)|ghost]] resembling the late King Hamlet which they have recently seen, and bring Prince Hamlet's friend [[Horatio (Hamlet)|Horatio]] as a witness. After the ghost appears again, the three vow to tell Prince Hamlet what they have witnessed.\n\nAs the court gathers the next day, while King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviser [[Polonius]], Hamlet looks on glumly. During the court, Claudius grants permission for Polonius's son Laertes to return to school in France, and sends envoys to inform the King of Norway about Fortinbras. Claudius also scolds Hamlet for continuing to grieve over his father, and forbids him to return to his schooling in [[Wittenberg]]. After the court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage. Learning of the ghost from Horatio, Hamlet resolves to see it himself.\n\n[[Image:Henry Fuseli - Hamlet and the Ghost.JPG|thumb|Horatio, Hamlet, and the ghost (Artist: [[Henry Fuseli]], 1789)<ref>''Hamlet'' 1.4.</ref>]]\nAs Polonius's son Laertes prepares to depart for a visit to France, Polonius gives him contradictory advice that culminates in the ironic maxim \"to thine own self be true.\"{{sfn|Trilling|2009|p=8}} Polonius's daughter, [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]], admits her interest in Hamlet, but Laertes warns her against seeking the prince's attention, and Polonius orders her to reject his advances. That night on the rampart, the ghost appears to Hamlet, telling the prince that he was murdered by Claudius and demanding that Hamlet avenge him. Hamlet agrees and the ghost vanishes. The prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that from now on he plans to \"put an antic disposition on\", or act as though he has gone mad, and forces them to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret. Privately, however, he remains uncertain of the ghost's reliability.\n\n===Act II===\nSoon thereafter, Ophelia rushes to her father, telling him that Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and behaving erratically. Polonius blames love for Hamlet's madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. As he enters to do so, the king and queen finish welcoming [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]], two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the students investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood and behaviour. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the King of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against Poland, though they will pass through Danish territory to get there.\n\nPolonius tells Claudius and Gertrude his theory regarding Hamlet's behaviour, and speaks to Hamlet in a hall of the castle to try to uncover more information. Hamlet feigns madness but subtly insults Polonius all the while. When Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet greets his \"friends\" warmly, but quickly discerns that they are spies. Hamlet becomes bitter, admitting that he is upset at his situation but refusing to give the true reason why, instead commenting on \"[[What a piece of work is a man|what a piece of work]]\" humanity is. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell Hamlet that they have brought along a troupe of actors that they met while traveling to Elsinore. Hamlet, after welcoming the actors and dismissing his friends-turned-spies, asks them to deliver a soliloquy about the death of [[King Priam]] and [[Hecuba|Queen Hecuba]] at the climax of the [[Trojan War]]. Impressed by their delivery of the speech, he plots to stage ''The Murder of Gonzago'', a play featuring a death in the style of his father's murder, and to determine the truth of the ghost's story, as well as Claudius's guilt or innocence, by studying Claudius's reaction.\n\n===Act III===\nPolonius forces Ophelia to return Hamlet's love letters and tokens of affection to the prince while he and Claudius watch from afar to evaluate Hamlet's reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia's entrance, musing whether \"[[To be, or not to be|to be or not to be]]\". When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet's things, Hamlet accuses her of immodesty and cries \"get thee to a nunnery\", though it is unclear whether this, too, is a show of madness or genuine distress. His reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is not mad for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing the [[Characters in Hamlet#the Players|Player King]] murdered by his rival pouring poison in his ear, Claudius abruptly rises and runs from the room: for Hamlet, proof positive of his uncle's guilt.\n\n[[File:Hamlet stabs Polonius.jpg|thumb|Hamlet mistakenly stabs Polonius (Artist: Coke Smyth, 19th century).]]\nGertrude summons Hamlet to her room to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has possession of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. Hamlet, on his way to visit his mother, sneaks up behind him, but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a [[tapestry]], calls for help as Gertrude, believing Hamlet wants to kill her, calls out for help herself.\n\nHamlet, believing it is Claudius, stabs wildly, killing Polonius, but pulls aside the curtain and sees his mistake. In a rage, Hamlet brutally insults his mother for her apparent ignorance of Claudius's villainy, but the ghost enters and reprimands Hamlet for his inaction and harsh words.  Unable to see or hear the ghost herself, Gertrude takes Hamlet's conversation with it as further evidence of madness. After begging the queen to stop sleeping with Claudius, Hamlet leaves, dragging Polonius's corpse away.\n\n===Act IV===\nHamlet jokes with Claudius about where he has hidden Polonius's body, and the king, fearing for his life, sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to accompany Hamlet to [[England]] with a sealed letter to the English king requesting that Hamlet be executed immediately.\n\nDemented by grief at Polonius's death, Ophelia wanders Elsinore. Laertes arrives back from France, enraged by his father's death and his sister's madness. Claudius convinces Laertes that Hamlet is solely responsible, but a letter soon arrives indicating that Hamlet has returned to Denmark, foiling Claudius' plan. Claudius switches tactics, proposing a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet to settle their differences.  Laertes will be given a poison-tipped foil, and Claudius will offer Hamlet poisoned wine as a congratulation if that fails. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has drowned, though it is unclear whether it was suicide or an accident exacerbated by her madness.\n\n[[Image:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 018.jpg|thumb|left|The gravedigger scene{{efn |name= gravedigger |The gravedigger scene is in ''Hamlet'' 5.1.1\u2013205.{{refn |''Hamlet'' 5.1.1\u2013205}}}} (Artist: [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], 1839)]]\n\n===Act V===\nHoratio has received a letter from Hamlet, explaining that the prince escaped by negotiating with pirates who attempted to attack his England-bound ship, and the friends reunite offstage. Two [[Characters in Hamlet#Ophelia's funeral|gravediggers]] discuss Ophelia's apparent suicide while digging her grave.  Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with one of the gravediggers, who unearths the skull of a [[jester]] from Hamlet's childhood, [[Yorick (Hamlet)|Yorick]]. Hamlet picks up the skull, saying \"alas, poor Yorick\" as he contemplates mortality. Ophelia's [[funeral procession]] approaches, led by Laertes. Hamlet and Horatio initially hide, but when Hamlet realizes that Ophelia is the one being buried, he reveals himself, proclaiming his love for her. Laertes and Hamlet fight by Ophelia's graveside, but the brawl is broken up.\n\nBack at Elsinore, Hamlet explains to Horatio that he had discovered Claudius's letter with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's belongings and replaced it with a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier, [[Characters in Hamlet#Osric|Osric]], interrupts the conversation to deliver the [[fencing]] challenge to Hamlet. Hamlet, despite Horatio's pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of [[wine]] Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her, but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius's plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor and living whilst Hamlet does not, says he will commit [[suicide]] by drinking the dregs of Gertrude's poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies in Horatio's arms, proclaiming \"the rest is silence\".  Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full story of what happened, and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself, and orders a military funeral to honour Hamlet.\n\n==Sources==\n{{Main|Sources of Hamlet}}\n[[File:Saxo original 001.jpg|thumb|upright|A facsimile of ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], which contains the legend of Amleth]]\n\n''Hamlet''-like legends are so widely found (for example in Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, Byzantium, and Arabia) that the core \"hero-as-fool\" theme is possibly [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] in origin.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=36\u20137}} Several ancient written precursors to ''Hamlet'' can be identified. The first is the anonymous Scandinavian ''[[Hr\u00f3lfs saga kraka|Saga of Hrolf Kraki]]''. In this, the murdered king has two sons\u2014[[Hro\u00f0gar|Hroar]] and [[Halga|Helgi]]\u2014who spend most of the story in disguise, under false names, rather than feigning madness, in a sequence of events that differs from Shakespeare's.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=16\u201325}} The second is the Roman legend of [[Lucius Junius Brutus#Biography|Brutus]], recorded in two separate Latin works. Its hero, Lucius (\"shining, light\"), changes his name and [[persona]] to Brutus (\"dull, stupid\"), playing the role of a fool to avoid the fate of his father and brothers, and eventually slaying his family's killer, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|King Tarquinius]]. A 17th-century Nordic scholar, [[Torfaeus]], compared the Icelandic hero Amlodi and the Spanish hero Prince Ambales (from the ''[[Ambales Saga]]'') to Shakespeare's ''Hamlet''. Similarities include the prince's feigned madness, his accidental killing of the king's counsellor in his mother's bedroom, and the eventual slaying of his uncle.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=5\u201315}}\n\nMany of the earlier legendary elements are interwoven in the 13th-century \"Life of Amleth\" ({{lang-la|Vita Amlethi}}) by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], part of ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=1\u20135}} Written in Latin, it reflects classical Roman concepts of virtue and heroism, and was widely available in Shakespeare's day.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=25\u201337}} Significant parallels include the prince feigning madness, his mother's hasty marriage to the usurper, the prince killing a hidden spy, and the prince substituting the execution of two retainers for his own. A reasonably faithful version of Saxo's story was translated into French in 1570 by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest]], in his ''Histoires tragiques''.{{sfn|Edwards|1985|pp=1\u20132}} Belleforest embellished Saxo's text substantially, almost doubling its length, and introduced the hero's [[melancholia|melancholy]].{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=66\u20137}}\n\n[[File:The Spanish Tragedy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Title page of ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' by Thomas Kyd]]\n\nAccording to one theory, Shakespeare's main source is an earlier play\u2014now lost\u2014known today as the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]''. Possibly written by [[Thomas Kyd]] or even William Shakespeare, the ''Ur-Hamlet'' would have existed by 1589, and would have incorporated a ghost.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|pp=82\u20135}} Shakespeare's company, [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|the Chamberlain's Men]], may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|p=67}} However, since no copy of the ''Ur-Hamlet'' has survived, it is impossible to compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of ''Hamlet'' by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea\u2014placing ''Hamlet'' far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development\u2014has attracted some support.{{efn|In his 1936 book ''The Problem of Hamlet: A Solution'' Andrew Cairncross asserted that the ''Hamlet'' referred to in 1589 was written by Shakespeare;{{sfn|Cairncross|1975}} Peter Alexander,{{sfn|Alexander|1964}} [[Eric Sams]]{{sfn|Jackson|1991|p=267}} and, more recently, [[Harold Bloom]]{{sfn|Bloom|2001|pp=xiii,383}}{{sfn|Bloom|2003|p=154}} have agreed. However Harold Jenkins, the editor of the second series Arden edition of the play, considers that there are not grounds for thinking that the Ur-Hamlet is an early work by Shakespeare, which he then rewrote.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|p=84 n4}}}}\n\nThe upshot is that scholars cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the ''Ur-Hamlet'' (if it even existed), how much from Belleforest or Saxo, and how much from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]''). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo's version. However, elements of Belleforest's version which are not in Saxo's story do appear in Shakespeare's play. Whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or from the hypothetical ''Ur-Hamlet'' remains unclear.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=66\u20138}}\n\nMost scholars reject the idea that ''Hamlet'' is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, [[Hamnet Shakespeare]], who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that ''Hamlet'' is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|p=6}} However, [[Stephen Greenblatt]] has argued that the [[coincidence]] of the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may lie at the heart of the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2004a|p=311}}{{sfn|Greenblatt|2004b}}\n\nScholars have often speculated that ''Hamlet''{{'}}s [[Polonius]] might have been inspired by [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] (Lord Burghley)\u2014Lord High Treasurer and chief counsellor to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&nbsp;I]].

Harvey's note says that \"the wiser sort\" enjoy ''Hamlet'', and implies that [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|the Earl of Essex]]\u2014executed in February 1601 for rebellion\u2014was still alive. Other scholars consider this inconclusive. Edwards, for example, concludes that the \"sense of time is so confused in Harvey's note that it is really of little use in trying to date  {{italic correction|''Hamlet''}}\". This is because the same note also refers to [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] and [[Thomas Watson (poet)|Watson]] as if they were still alive (\"our flourishing [[Meter (poetry)|metricians]]\"), but also mentions \"[[John Owen (epigrammatist)|Owen's]] new epigrams\", published in 1607.{{sfn|Edwards|1985|p=5}}\n\n==Texts==\n[[File:Hamlet.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Title page]] of the 1605 printing (Q2) of ''Hamlet'']]\n\nThree early editions of the text have survived, making attempts to establish a single \"authentic\" text problematic and inconclusive.{{sfn|Hattaway|1987|pp=13\u201320}} Each surviving edition differs from the others:{{sfn|Chambers|1923b|pp=486\u20137}}{{sfn|Halliday|1964|pp=204\u20135}}\n\n*[[Hamlet Q1|First Quarto]] ('''Q1'''): In 1603 the booksellers [[Nicholas Ling]] and John Trundell published, and [[Valentine Simmes]] printed, the so-called \"[[Bad quarto|bad]]\" first quarto.

Some copies are dated 1605, which may indicate a second impression; consequently, Q2 is often dated \"1604/5\". Q2 is the longest early edition, although it omits about 77 lines found in F1{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|p=465}} (most likely to avoid offending [[James I of England|James I's]] queen, [[Anne of Denmark]]).{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=204}}\n*[[First Folio]] ('''F1'''): In 1623 [[Edward Blount]] and [[William Jaggard|William and Isaac Jaggard]] published the First Folio, the first edition of Shakespeare's ''Complete Works''.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|p=78}}\n\nOther [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|folios and quartos]] were subsequently published\u2014including [[John Smethwick]]'s Q3, Q4, and Q5 (1611\u201337)\u2014but these are regarded as derivatives of the first three editions.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|p=78}}\n\n[[File:First-page-first-folio-Hamlet.jpg|thumb|The first page of the [[First Folio]] printing of ''Hamlet'', 1623]]\nEarly [[Shakespeare's editors|editors of Shakespeare's works]], beginning with [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]] (1709) and [[Lewis Theobald]] (1733), combined material from the two earliest sources of ''Hamlet'' available at the time, Q2 and F1. Each text contains material that the other lacks, with many minor differences in wording: scarcely 200 lines are identical in the two. Editors have combined them in an effort to create one \"inclusive\" text that reflects an imagined \"ideal\" of Shakespeare's original. Theobald's version became standard for a long time,{{sfn|Hibbard|1987|pp=22\u20133}} and his \"full text\" approach continues to influence editorial practice to the present day. Some contemporary scholarship, however, discounts this approach, instead considering \"an authentic ''Hamlet'' an unrealisable ideal. ... there are ''texts'' of this play but no ''text''\".{{sfn|Hattaway|1987|p=16}} The 2006 publication by Arden Shakespeare of different ''Hamlet'' texts in different volumes is perhaps evidence of this shifting focus and emphasis.{{efn|The [[Arden Shakespeare]] third series published Q2, with appendices, in their first volume,{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a}} and the F1 and Q1 texts in their second volume.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006b}} The [[RSC Shakespeare]] is the F1 text with additional Q2 passages in an appendix.{{sfn|Bate|Rasmussen|2007|p=1923}} The [[New Cambridge Shakespeare]] series has begun to publish separate volumes for the separate quarto versions that exist of Shakespeare's plays.{{sfn|Irace|1998}}}} Other editors have continued to argue the need for well-edited editions taking material from all versions of the play. Colin Burrow has argued that \"most of us should read a text that is made up by conflating all three versions ... it's about as likely that Shakespeare wrote: \"To be or not to be, ay, there's the point\" [in Q1], as that he wrote the works of [[Francis Bacon]]. I suspect most people just won't want to read a three-text play ... [multi-text editions are] a version of the play that is out of touch with the needs of a wider public.\"{{sfn|Burrow|2002}}\n\nTraditionally, editors of Shakespeare's plays have divided them into five [[Act (theater)|acts]]. None of the early texts of ''Hamlet'', however, were arranged this way, and the play's division into acts and scenes derives from a 1676 quarto. Modern editors generally follow this traditional division, but consider it unsatisfactory; for example, after Hamlet drags Polonius's body out of Gertrude's bedchamber, there is an act-break<ref>''Hamlet'' 3.4 and 4.1.</ref> after which the action appears to continue uninterrupted.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=543\u201352}}\n\n[[File:Bad quarto, good quarto, first folio.png|thumb|Comparison of the 'To be, or not to be' soliloquy in the first three editions of Hamlet, showing the varying quality of the text in the [[Bad Quarto]], the Good Quarto and the [[First Folio]]]]\n\nThe discovery in 1823 of Q1\u2014whose existence had been quite unsuspected\u2014caused considerable interest and excitement, raising many questions of editorial practice and interpretation. Scholars immediately identified apparent deficiencies in Q1, which was instrumental in the development of the concept of a Shakespearean \"[[bad quarto]]\".{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|p=14}} Yet Q1 has value: it contains stage directions (such as Ophelia entering with a lute and her hair down) that reveal actual stage practices in a way that Q2 and F1 do not; it contains an entire scene (usually labelled 4.6)<ref>''Hamlet Q1'' 14.</ref> that does not appear in either Q2 or F1; and it is useful for comparison with the later editions. The major deficiency of Q1 is in the language: particularly noticeable in the opening lines of the famous \"[[To be, or not to be]]\" soliloquy: \"To be, or not to be, aye there's the point. / To die, to sleep, is that all? Aye all: / No, to sleep, to dream, aye marry there it goes.\" However, the scene order is more coherent, without the problems of Q2 and F1 of Hamlet seeming to resolve something in one scene and enter the next drowning in indecision. New Cambridge editor Kathleen Irace has noted that \"Q1's more linear plot design is certainly easier [\u2026] to follow [\u2026] but the simplicity of the Q1 plot arrangement eliminates the alternating plot elements that correspond to Hamlet's shifts in mood.\"{{sfn|Irace|1998|pp=1\u201334}}\n\nQ1 is considerably shorter than Q2 or F1 and may be a [[memorial reconstruction]] of the play as Shakespeare's company performed it, by an actor who played a minor role (most likely Marcellus).{{sfn|Jackson|1986|p=171}} Scholars disagree whether the reconstruction was pirated or authorised. It is suggested by Irace that Q1 is an abridged version intended especially for travelling productions, thus the question of length may be considered as separate from issues of poor textual quality.{{sfn|Irace|1998}}{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=85\u20136}} Editing Q1 thus poses problems in whether or not to \"correct\" differences from Q2 and F. Irace, in her introduction to Q1, wrote that \"I have avoided as many other alterations as possible, because the differences...are especially intriguing...I have recorded a selection of Q2/F readings in the collation.\" The idea that Q1 is not riddled with error but is instead eminently fit for the stage has led to at least 28 different Q1 productions since 1881.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006b|pp=36\u20139}} Other productions have used the probably superior Q2 and Folio texts, but used Q1's running order, in particular moving the ''to be or not to be'' soliloquy earlier.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=18\u201319}} Developing this, some editors such as [[Jonathan Bate]] have argued that Q2 may represent \"a 'reading' text as opposed to a 'performance' one\" of ''Hamlet'', analogous to how modern films released on disc may include deleted scenes: an edition containing all of Shakespeare's material for the play for the pleasure of readers, so not representing the play as it would have been staged.{{sfn|Bate|Rasmussen|2008|p=11}}{{sfn|Crowl|2014|pp=5\u20136}}\n\n==Analysis and criticism==\n{{Main|Critical approaches to Hamlet}}\n\n===Critical history===\nFrom the early 17th century, the play was famous for its ghost and vivid dramatisation of [[Melancholia|melancholy]] and [[insanity]], leading to a procession of mad courtiers and ladies in [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] and [[Caroline era|Caroline]] drama.{{sfn|Wofford|1994}}{{sfn|Kirsch|1969}} Though it remained popular with mass audiences, late 17th-century [[English Restoration|Restoration]] critics saw ''Hamlet'' as primitive and disapproved of its lack of [[Classical unities|unity]] and [[decorum]].{{sfn|Vickers|1974a|p=447}}{{sfn|Vickers|1974b|p=92}} This view changed drastically in the 18th century, when critics regarded Hamlet as a hero\u2014a pure, brilliant young man thrust into unfortunate circumstances.{{sfn|Wofford|1994|p=184\u20135}} By the mid-18th century, however, the advent of [[Gothic fiction|Gothic literature]] brought [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[Mysticism|mystical]] readings, returning madness and the ghost to the forefront.{{sfn|Vickers|1974c|p=5}} Not until the late 18th century did critics and performers begin to view Hamlet as confusing and inconsistent. Before then, he was either mad, or not; either a hero, or not; with no in-betweens.{{sfn|Wofford|1994|p=185}} These developments represented a fundamental change in literary criticism, which came to focus more on character and less on plot.{{sfn|Wofford|1994|p=186}} By the 19th century, [[Romanticism|Romantic]] critics valued ''Hamlet'' for its internal, individual conflict reflecting the strong contemporary emphasis on internal struggles and inner character in general.{{sfn|Rosenberg|1992|p=179}} Then too, critics started to focus on Hamlet's delay as a character trait, rather than a plot device.{{sfn|Wofford|1994|p=186}} This focus on character and internal struggle continued into the 20th century, when criticism branched in several directions, discussed in [[#Context and interpretation|context and interpretation]] below.\n\n===Dramatic structure===\n''Hamlet'' departed from contemporary dramatic convention in several ways. For example, in Shakespeare's day, plays were usually expected to follow the advice of [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'': that a drama should focus on action, not character. In ''Hamlet'', Shakespeare reverses this so that it is through the [[Monologue|soliloquies]], not the action, that the audience learns Hamlet's motives and thoughts. The play is full of seeming discontinuities and irregularities of action, except in the \"bad\" quarto. At one point, as in the Gravedigger scene,{{efn|name=gravedigger}} Hamlet seems resolved to kill Claudius: in the next scene, however, when Claudius appears, he is suddenly tame. Scholars still debate whether these twists are mistakes or intentional additions to add to the play's themes of confusion and duality.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=67\u201372, 84}}  ''Hamlet'' also contains a recurrent Shakespearean device, a [[Play within a play|play within the play]], a literary device or conceit in which one story is told during the action of another story.{{efn|Also used in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.{{sfn|Kermode|2000|p=256}}}}\n\n===Length===\n''Hamlet'' is Shakespeare's longest play.  The [[The Riverside Shakespeare|Riverside edition]] constitutes 4,042 lines totaling 29,551 words, typically requiring over four hours to stage.{{sfn|Evans|1974}}{{efn|This compares with about two to three hours for a typical Elizajacobean play.{{sfn|Hirrel|2010}}}} It is rare that the play is performed without some abridgments, and only one film adaptation has used a full-text conflation: [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s [[Hamlet (1996 film)|1996 version]], which runs slightly more than four hours.\n\n===Language===\n[[File:Delacroix-1834-I2-QueenConsolesHamlet.JPG|thumb|Hamlet's statement that his dark clothes are the outer sign of his inner grief demonstrates strong rhetorical skill (artist: [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] 1834).]]\n\nMuch of ''Hamlet'''s language is courtly: elaborate, witty discourse, as recommended by [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s 1528 etiquette guide, ''The Courtier''. This work specifically advises royal retainers to amuse their masters with inventive language. Osric and Polonius, especially, seem to respect this injunction. Claudius's speech is rich with rhetorical figures\u2014as is Hamlet's and, at times, Ophelia's\u2014while the language of Horatio, the guards, and the gravediggers is simpler. Claudius's high status is reinforced by using the [[Majestic plural|royal first person plural]] (\"we\" or \"us\"), and [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]] mixed with [[metaphor]] to resonate with Greek political speeches.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=84\u20135}}\n\nOf all the characters, Hamlet has the greatest rhetorical skill. He uses highly developed metaphors, [[stichomythia]], and in nine memorable words deploys both anaphora and [[asyndeton]]: \"to die: to sleep\u2014&nbsp;/ To sleep, perchance to dream\".<ref>''Hamlet'' 3.1.63\u201364.</ref> In contrast, when occasion demands, he is precise and straightforward, as when he explains his inward emotion to his mother: \"But I have that within which passes show,&nbsp;/ These but the trappings and the suits of woe\".<ref>''Hamlet'' 1.2.85\u201386.</ref> At times, he relies heavily on [[pun]]s to express his true thoughts while simultaneously concealing them.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=89\u201390}} His \"nunnery\" remarks{{efn|name=nunnery|The \"Nunnery Scene\" is ''Hamlet'' 3.1.87\u2013160.{{refn|''Hamlet'' 3.1.87\u2013160}}}} to Ophelia are an example of a cruel [[double entendre|double meaning]] as ''nunnery'' was [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] slang for ''brothel''.{{sfn|OED|2005}}{{efn|This interpretation is widely held,{{sfn|Kiernan|2007|p=34}} but has been challenged by, among others, Harold Jenkins.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|pp=493\u20135}} He finds the evidence for a precedent for that interpretation to be insufficient and inconclusive, and considers the literal interpretation to be better suited to the dramatic context.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|pp=493\u20135}}}} His very first words in the play are a pun; when Claudius addresses him as \"my cousin Hamlet, and my son\", Hamlet says as an aside: \"A little more than kin, and less than kind.\"<ref>''Hamlet'' 2.1.63\u201365.</ref>\n\nAn unusual rhetorical device, [[hendiadys]], appears in several places in the play. Examples are found in Ophelia's speech at the end of the nunnery scene: \"Th'''expectancy and rose'' of the fair state\"<ref>''Hamlet'' 3.1.151.</ref> and \"And I, of ladies most ''deject and wretched''\".<ref>''Hamlet'' 3.1.154.</ref> Many scholars have found it odd that Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. One explanation may be that ''Hamlet'' was written later in Shakespeare's life, when he was adept at matching rhetorical devices to characters and the plot. Linguist George T. Wright suggests that hendiadys had been used deliberately to heighten the play's sense of duality and dislocation.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=87\u20138}} Pauline Kiernan argues that Shakespeare changed English drama forever in ''Hamlet'' because he \"showed how a character's language can often be saying several things at once, and contradictory meanings at that, to reflect fragmented thoughts and disturbed feelings\". She gives the example of Hamlet's advice to Ophelia, \"get thee to a nunnery\", which is simultaneously a reference to a place of chastity and a slang term for a brothel, reflecting Hamlet's confused feelings about female sexuality.{{sfn|Kiernan|2007|p=34}}\n\nHamlet's [[Monologue|soliloquies]] have also captured the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the thrust of his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=91\u20133}}\n\n==Context and interpretation==\n\n===Religious===\n[[File:John Everett Millais - Ophelia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[John Everett Millais]]' ''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' (1852) depicts Lady Ophelia's mysterious death by drowning. In the play, the gravediggers discuss whether Ophelia's death was a suicide and whether she merits a Christian burial.]]\n\nWritten at a time of religious upheaval, and in the wake of the [[English Reformation]], the play is alternately [[Catholicism|Catholic]] (or piously medieval) and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] (or consciously modern). The ghost describes himself as being in [[purgatory]], and as dying without [[last rites]]. This and Ophelia's burial ceremony, which is characteristically Catholic, make up most of the play's Catholic connections. Some scholars have observed that [[Revenge play|revenge tragedies]] come from Catholic countries like Italy and Spain, where the revenge tragedies present contradictions of motives, since according to Catholic doctrine the duty to God and family precedes civil justice. Hamlet's conundrum, then, is whether to avenge his father and kill Claudius, or to leave the vengeance to God, as his religion requires.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=37\u20138}}{{efn|In the [[New Testament]], see Romans 12:19: \"'vengeance is mine, I will repay' sayeth the Lord\".}}\n\nMuch of the play's Protestant tones derive from its setting in Denmark\u2014both then and now a predominantly Protestant country,{{efn|See the articles on the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein]] and [[Church of Denmark]] for details.}} though it is unclear whether the fictional Denmark of the play is intended to portray this implicit fact. Dialogue refers explicitly to [[Wittenberg]], where Hamlet, Horatio, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern attend university, implying where [[Martin Luther]] in 1517 first proposed his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|95 theses]] and thereby initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]].{{sfn|MacCary|1998|p=38}}\n\n===Philosophical===\n[[File:Michel de Montaigne 1.jpg|thumb|Philosophical ideas in ''Hamlet'' are similar to those of the French writer [[Michel de Montaigne]], a contemporary of Shakespeare's (artist: [[Thomas de Leu]], fl.&nbsp;1560\u20131612).]]\n\nHamlet is often perceived as a philosophical character, expounding ideas that are now described as [[relativism|relativist]], [[existentialism|existentialist]], and [[scepticism|sceptical]]. For example, he expresses a subjectivistic idea when he says to Rosencrantz: \"there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so\".<ref>''Hamlet F1'' 2.2.247\u2013248.</ref> The idea that nothing is real except in the mind of the individual finds its roots in the Greek [[Sophism|Sophists]], who argued that since nothing can be perceived except through the senses\u2014and since all individuals sense, and therefore perceive things differently\u2014there is no absolute truth, but rather only relative truth.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=47\u20138}} The clearest alleged instance of existentialism is in the \"[[to be, or not to be]]\"<ref>''Hamlet'' 3.1.55\u201387.</ref> speech, where Hamlet is thought by some to use \"being\" to allude to life and action, and \"not being\" to death and inaction.\n\n''Hamlet'' reflects the contemporary [[Philosophical scepticism|scepticism]] promoted by the French [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] [[Michel de Montaigne]].{{sfn|MacCary|1998|p=49}} Prior to Montaigne's time, humanists such as [[Pico della Mirandola]] had argued that man was God's greatest creation, made in God's image and able to choose his own nature, but this view was subsequently challenged in Montaigne's ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'' of 1580. Hamlet's \"[[What a piece of work is a man]]\" seems to echo many of Montaigne's ideas, and many scholars have discussed whether Shakespeare drew directly from Montaigne or whether both men were simply reacting similarly to the spirit of the times.{{sfn|Knowles|1999|pp=1049, 1052\u20133}}{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=73\u20134}}{{sfn|MacCary|1998|p=49}}\n\n===Psychoanalytic===\n[[File:Claudius at Prayer Hamlet 3-3 Delacroix 1844.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] suggested that an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal conflict]] caused Hamlet's hesitations (artist: [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] 1844).]]\nIn the first half of the 20th century, when [[psychoanalysis]] was at the height of its influence, its concepts were applied to ''Hamlet'', notably by [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Ernest Jones]], and [[Jacques Lacan]], and these studies influenced theatrical productions. In his ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1900), Freud's analysis starts from the premise that \"the play is built up on Hamlet's hesitations over fulfilling the task of revenge that is assigned to him; but its text offers no reasons or motives for these hesitations\".{{sfn|Freud|1900|pp=367\u20138}} After reviewing various literary theories, Freud concludes that Hamlet has an \"[[Oedipus complex|Oedipal desire]] for his mother and the subsequent guilt [is] preventing him from murdering the man [Claudius] who has done what he unconsciously wanted to do\".{{sfn|Britton|1995|pp=207\u201311}} Confronted with his [[psychological repression|repressed desires]], Hamlet realises that \"he himself is literally no better than the sinner whom he is to punish\".{{sfn|Freud|1900|pp=367\u20138}} Freud suggests that Hamlet's apparent \"distaste for sexuality\"\u2014articulated in his \"nunnery\" conversation with Ophelia\u2014accords with this interpretation.{{sfn|Freud|1900|pp=367\u20138}}{{efn|name=nunnery}} [[John Barrymore]]'s long-running 1922 performance in New York, directed by Thomas Hopkins, \"broke new ground in its Freudian approach to character\", in keeping with the post-World War I rebellion against everything Victorian.{{sfn|Morrison|1997|pp=4, 129\u201330}} He had a \"blunter intention\" than presenting the genteel, sweet prince of 19th-century tradition, imbuing his character with virility and lust.{{sfn|Cotsell|2005|p=191}}\n\nBeginning in 1910, with the publication of \"The \u0152dipus-Complex as an Explanation of Hamlet's Mystery: A Study in Motive\"{{sfn|Jones|1910}} [[Ernest Jones]]\u2014a psychoanalyst and Freud's biographer\u2014developed Freud's ideas into a series of essays that culminated in his book ''[[Hamlet and Oedipus]]'' (1949).

Ophelia's madness after her father's death may also be read through the Freudian lens: as a reaction to the death of her hoped-for lover, her father. Ophelia is overwhelmed by having her unfulfilled love for him so abruptly terminated and drifts into the oblivion of insanity.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=104\u20137, 113\u201316}}{{sfn|de Grazia|2007|pp=168\u201370}} In 1937, [[Tyrone Guthrie]] directed [[Laurence Olivier]] in a Jones-inspired ''Hamlet'' at [[The Old Vic]].{{sfn|Smallwood|2002|p=102}} Olivier later used some of these same ideas in his 1948 film version of the play.\n\nIn the 1950s, Lacan's [[structuralism|structuralist]] theories about ''Hamlet'' were first presented in a series of [[The Seminars of Jacques Lacan|seminars]] given in Paris and later published in \"Desire and the Interpretation of Desire in ''Hamlet''\". Lacan postulated that the human [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] is determined by structures of language and that the linguistic structures of ''Hamlet'' shed light on human desire.{{sfn|Britton|1995|pp=207\u201311}} His point of departure is Freud's Oedipal theories, and the central theme of mourning that runs through ''Hamlet''.{{sfn|Britton|1995|pp=207\u201311}} In Lacan's analysis, Hamlet unconsciously assumes the role of [[Phallus#Psychoanalysis|''phallus'']]\u2014the cause of his inaction\u2014and is increasingly distanced from reality \"by mourning, [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]], [[narcissism]] and [[psychosis]]\", which create holes (or [[lack (manque)|lack]]) in the real, imaginary, and symbolic aspects of his psyche.{{sfn|Britton|1995|pp=207\u201311}} Lacan's theories influenced literary criticism of ''Hamlet'' because of his alternative vision of the play and his use of [[semantics]] to explore the play's psychological landscape.{{sfn|Britton|1995|pp=207\u201311}}\n\nIn the ''Bloom's Shakespeare Through the Ages'' volume on Hamlet, editors Bloom and Foster express a conviction that the intentions of Shakespeare in portraying the character of Hamlet in the play exceeded the capacity of the Freudian Oedipus complex to completely encompass the extent of characteristics depicted in Hamlet throughout the tragedy: \"For once, Freud regressed in attempting to fasten the Oedipus Complex upon Hamlet: it will not stick, and merely showed that Freud did better than T.S. Eliot, who preferred ''Coriolanus'' to ''Hamlet'', or so he said. Who can believe Eliot, when he exposes his own Hamlet Complex by declaring the play to be an aesthetic failure?\"{{sfn|Bloom|Foster|2008|p=xii}} The book also notes James Joyce's interpretation, stating that he \"did far better in the Library Scene of ''Ulysses'', where Stephen marvelously credits Shakespeare, in this play, with universal fatherhood while accurately implying that Hamlet is fatherless, thus opening a pragmatic gap between Shakespeare and Hamlet.\"{{sfn|Bloom|Foster|2008|p=xii}}\n\nJoshua Rothman has written in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that \"we tell the story wrong when we say that Freud used the idea of the Oedipus complex to understand ''Hamlet''\". Rothman suggests that \"it was the other way around: ''Hamlet'' helped Freud understand, and perhaps even invent, psychoanalysis\". He concludes, \"The Oedipus complex is a misnomer. It should be called the 'Hamlet complex'.\"{{sfn|Rothman|2013}}\n\nIn the essay \"Hamlet Made Simple\", David P. Gontar turns the tables on the psychoanalysts by suggesting that Claudius is not a symbolic father figure but actually Prince Hamlet's biological father. The hesitation in killing Claudius results from an unwillingness on Hamlet's part to slay his real father. If Hamlet is the biological son of Claudius, that explains many things. Hamlet does not become King of Denmark on the occasion of the King's death inasmuch as it is an open secret in court that he is Claudius's biological son, and as such he is merely a court bastard not in the line of succession. He is angry with his mother because of her long standing affair with a man Hamlet hates, and Hamlet must face the fact that he has been sired by the man he loathes. That point overturns T. S. Eliot's complaint that the play is a failure for not furnishing an \"objective correlative\" to account for Hamlet's rage at his mother. Gontar suggests that if the reader assumes that Hamlet is not who he seems to be, the objective correlative becomes apparent. Hamlet is suicidal in the first soliloquy not because his mother quickly remarries but because of her adulterous affair with the despised Claudius which makes Hamlet his son. Finally, the ghost's confirmation of an alternative fatherhood for Hamlet is a fabrication that gives the prince a motive for revenge.{{sfn|Gontar|2013}}\n\n===Feminist===\n[[File:Ophelia - Henrietta Rae.jpg|thumb|[[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] is distracted by grief.<ref>''Hamlet'' 4.5.</ref> Feminist critics have explored her descent into madness (artist: Henrietta Rae 1890).]]\nIn the 20th century, [[feminist literary criticism|feminist critics]] opened up new approaches to Gertrude and Ophelia. [[New Historicism|New Historicist]] and [[cultural materialism (cultural studies)|cultural materialist]] critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment.{{sfn|Wofford|1994|pp=199\u2013202}} They focused on the [[Gender role|gender system]] of [[Early modern period|early modern]] England, pointing to the common trinity of ''maid, wife, or widow'', with ''whores'' outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of ''Hamlet'' is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, can be seen as honest and fair; however, it is virtually impossible to link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.{{sfn|Howard|2003|pp=411\u201315}}\n[[File:Hamlet (Abildgaard).jpg|thumb|Hamlet tries to show his mother Gertrude his father's ghost (artist: [[Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard|Nicolai A. Abildgaard]], ca. 1778).]]\n\n[[Carolyn Heilbrun]]'s 1957 essay \"The Character of Hamlet's Mother\" defends Gertrude, arguing that the text never hints that Gertrude knew of Claudius poisoning King Hamlet. This analysis has been praised by many feminist critics, combating what is, by Heilbrun's argument, centuries' worth of misinterpretation. By this account, Gertrude's worst crime is of pragmatically marrying her brother-in-law in order to avoid a power vacuum. This is borne out by the fact that King Hamlet's ghost tells Hamlet to leave Gertrude out of Hamlet's revenge, to leave her to heaven, an arbitrary mercy to grant to a conspirator to murder.{{sfn|Heilbrun|1957}}{{sfn|Bloom|2003|pp=58\u20139}}{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=4}} This view has not been without objection from some critics.{{efn|\"There is a recent 'Be kind to Gertrude' fashion among some feminist critics \u2026\"{{sfn|Bloom|2003}}}}\n\nOphelia has also been defended by feminist critics, most notably [[Elaine Showalter]].{{sfn|Showalter|1985}} Ophelia is surrounded by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia is driven into madness.{{sfn|Bloom|2003|p=57}} Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father so they can be together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=111\u201313}}\n\n==Influence==\n{{see also|Literary influence of Hamlet}}\n\n''Hamlet'' is one of the [[Phrases from Hamlet in common English|most quoted]] works in the English language, and is often included on lists of the world's greatest literature.{{efn|''Hamlet'' has 208 quotations in ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]''; it takes up 10 of 85 pages dedicated to Shakespeare in the 1986 ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations|Bartlett's Familiar Quotations (14th ed. 1968)]]''.

Academic Laurie Osborne identifies the direct influence of ''Hamlet'' in numerous modern narratives, and divides them into four main categories: fictional accounts of the play's composition, simplifications of the story for young readers, stories expanding the role of one or more characters, and narratives featuring performances of the play.{{sfn|Osborne|2007|pp=114\u201333}}\n\n[[File:Czach\u00f3rski Actors before Hamlet.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Actors before Hamlet'' by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Czach\u00f3rski]] (1875), [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]].]]\n\nEnglish poet [[John Milton]] was an early admirer of Shakespeare, and took evident inspiration from his work. As John Kerrigan discusses, Milton originally considered writing his epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667) as a tragedy.{{sfn|Kerrigan|1996|p=122}} While Milton did not ultimately go that route, the poem still shows distinct echoes of Shakespearean revenge tragedy, and of ''Hamlet'' in particular.

Baum would later recount the actual story in an article, but the short story is told from the point of view of the actor playing the ghost.\n\nIn the 1920s, [[James Joyce]] managed \"a more upbeat version\" of ''Hamlet''\u2014stripped of obsession and revenge\u2014in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', though its main parallels are with [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=123\u20136}} In the 1990s, two novelists were explicitly influenced by ''Hamlet''.

The Gielgud/Burton production was also recorded complete and released on LP by [[Columbia Masterworks]].\n[[File:Bernhardt Hamlet2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sarah Bernhardt]] as Hamlet, with [[Yorick]]'s skull (photographer: [[James Lafayette]], c.&nbsp;1885\u20131900).]]\nThe first ''Hamlet'' in color was a [[Hamlet (1969 film)|1969 film]] directed by [[Tony Richardson]] with [[Nicol Williamson]] as Hamlet and [[Marianne Faithfull]] as Ophelia.\n\nIn 1990 [[Franco Zeffirelli]], whose Shakespeare films have been described as \"sensual rather than cerebral\",{{sfn|Cartmell|2000|p=212}} cast [[Mel Gibson]]\u2014then famous for the ''[[Mad Max]]'' and ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' movies\u2014in the title role of his [[Hamlet (1990 film)|1990 version]]; [[Glenn Close]]\u2014then famous as the psychotic \"other woman\" in ''[[Fatal Attraction]]''\u2014played Gertrude,{{sfn|Guntner|2000|pp=121\u20132}} and [[Paul Scofield]] played Hamlet's father.\n\nIn contrast to Zeffirelli, whose ''Hamlet'' was heavily cut, [[Kenneth Branagh]] adapted, directed, and starred in a 1996 version containing every word of Shakespeare's play, combining the material from the F1 and Q2 texts. Branagh's [[Hamlet (1996 film)|''Hamlet'']] runs for just over four hours.{{sfn|Crowl|2000|p=232}} Branagh set the film with late 19th-century costuming and furnishings, a production in many ways reminiscent of a Russian novel of the time;{{sfn|Starks|1999|p=272}} and [[Blenheim Palace]], built in the early 18th century, became Elsinore Castle in the external scenes. The film is structured as an [[Epic film|epic]] and makes frequent use of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s to highlight elements not made explicit in the play: Hamlet's sexual relationship with [[Kate Winslet]]'s Ophelia, for example, or his childhood affection for Yorick (played by [[Ken Dodd]]).{{sfn|Keyishian|2000|pp=78\u20139}}\n\nIn 2000, [[Michael Almereyda]]'s ''[[Hamlet (2000 film)|Hamlet]]'' set the story in contemporary [[Manhattan]], with [[Ethan Hawke]] playing Hamlet as a film student. Claudius (played by [[Kyle MacLachlan]]) became the CEO of \"Denmark Corporation\", having taken over the company by killing his brother.{{sfn|Burnett|2003}}\n\nThe 2002 ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Tales from the Public Domain]]\" features a retelling of the play.\n\nThere have also been several films that transposed the general storyline of ''Hamlet'' or elements thereof to other settings. For example, the 2014 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Haider (film)|Haider]]'' is an adaptation set in [[Kashmir]].{{sfn|Gupta|2014}} There have also been many films which included performances of scenes from ''Hamlet'' as a [[Story within a story|play-within-a-film]].\n\n===Stage pastiches===\nThere have been various \"derivative works\" of ''Hamlet'' which recast the story from the point of view of other characters, or transpose the story into a new setting or act as sequels or prequels to ''Hamlet''. This section is limited to those written for the stage.\n\nThe best-known is Tom Stoppard's 1966 play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', which retells many of the events of the story from the point of view of the characters Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and gives them a backstory of their own. Several times since 1995, the [[American Shakespeare Center]] has mounted repertories that included both ''Hamlet'' and ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern'', with the same actors performing the same roles in each; in their 2001 and 2009 seasons the two plays were \"directed, designed, and rehearsed together to make the most out of the shared scenes and situations\".{{sfn|Warren|n.d.}}\n\n[[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote a short comic play titled ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (play)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]'', in which Hamlet's play is presented as a tragedy written by Claudius in his youth of which he is greatly embarrassed. Through the chaos triggered by Hamlet's staging of it, Guildenstern helps Rosencrantz vie with Hamlet to make Ophelia his bride.{{sfn|Gilbert|1892|pp=349\u201366}}\n\n[[Lee Blessing]]'s ''[[Fortinbras (play)|Fortinbras]]'' is a comical sequel to ''Hamlet'' in which all the deceased characters come back as ghosts. The ''New York Times'' reviewed the play, saying it is \"scarcely more than an extended comedy sketch, lacking the portent and linguistic complexity of Tom Stoppard's ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead''. ''Fortinbras'' operates on a far less ambitious plane, but it is a ripping yarn and offers Keith Reddin a role in which he can commit comic mayhem\".{{sfn|Gussow|1992}}\n\n[[Caridad Svich]]'s ''12 Ophelias (a play with broken songs)'' includes elements of the story of ''Hamlet'' but focuses on Ophelia. In Svich's play, Ophelia is resurrected and rises from a pool of water, after her death in ''Hamlet''. The play is a series of scenes and songs, and was first staged at public swimming pool in Brooklyn.{{sfn|Schultz|2008}}\n\n[[David Davalos]]' ''Wittenberg'' is a \"tragical-comical-historical\" prequel to ''Hamlet'' that depicts the Danish prince as a student at Wittenberg University (now known as the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]]), where he is torn between the conflicting teachings of his mentors [[Faust|John Faustus]] and [[Martin Luther]]. The ''New York Times'' reviewed the play, saying, \"Mr. Davalos has molded a daft campus comedy out of this unlikely convergence,\"{{sfn|Grode|2011}} and ''[[Nytheatre.com]]'''s review said the playwright \"has imagined a fascinating alternate reality, and quite possibly, given the fictional Hamlet a back story that will inform the role for the future.\"{{sfn|Todoroff|2011}}\n\n''Mad Boy Chronicle'' by Canadian playwright Michael O'Brien is a dark comedy loosely based on ''Hamlet'', set in Viking Denmark in 999 A.D.{{sfn|Brandes|2001}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{notelist|30em}}\n\n===References===\n{{refbegin}}\nAll references to ''Hamlet'', unless otherwise specified, are taken from the [[Arden Shakespeare]] Q2.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a}} Under their referencing system, 3.1.55 means act 3, scene 1, line 55.

This is opposed to [[Low German]], which is spoken in the lowlands and along the flat sea coasts of the [[North German Plain]].<ref>See the definition of \"high\" in the Oxford English Dictionary (Concise Edition): \"... situated far above ground, sealevel, etc; upper, inland, as ... High German\".</ref>\n\nHigh German in this broader sense can be subdivided into [[Upper German]] (''Oberdeutsch'', this includes the [[Austrian German|Austrian]] and [[Swiss German]] dialects), [[Central German]] (''Mitteldeutsch'', this includes [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], which itself is now a [[standard language]]), and [[High Franconian German]], which is a transitional dialect between the two.<ref>Russ, Charles. The Dialects of Modern German: A Linguistic Survey. Routledge, 1989</ref>\n\nHigh German (in the broader sense) is distinguished from other West Germanic varieties in that it took part in the [[High German consonant shift]] (c. AD 500). To see this, compare [[English language|English]]/[[Low German]] (Low Saxon) ''pan/Pann'' with Standard German ''Pfanne'' ({{IPA|[p]}} to {{IPA|[p\u0361f]}}), English/Low German ''two/twee'' with Standard German ''zwei'' ({{IPA|[t]}} to {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}}),  English/Low German ''make/maken'' with Standard German ''machen'' ({{IPA|[k]}} to {{IPA|[x]}}).<ref>Robinson, Orrin. Old English and its Closest Relatives. Routledge, 1994.</ref> In the southernmost [[High Alemannic German|High Alemannic]] dialects, there is a further shift; ''Sack'' (like English/Low German \"sack/Sack\") is pronounced {{IPA|[z\u0325ak\u0361x]}} ({{IPA|[k]}} to {{IPA|[k\u0361x]}}).\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Theodiscus}}\n[[Old High German]] evolved from about 500 AD. Around 1200 the [[Swabian German|Swabian]] and [[East Franconian German|East Franconian]] varieties of [[Middle High German]] became dominant as a court and poetry language (''[[Minnesang]]'') under the rule of the House of [[Hohenstaufen]].\n\nThe term \"High German\" as spoken in central and southern Germany ([[Upper Saxony]], [[Franconia]], [[Swabia]], [[Bavaria]]) and [[Austria]] was first documented in the 15th century. Gradually driving back Low German variants since the [[Early modern period]], the [[Early New High German]] varieties, especially the [[East Central German]] of the [[Luther Bible]], formed an important basis for the development of Standard German.<ref>Russ, Charles. The German Language Today: A Linguistic Introduction. Routledge, 1994.</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\nDivisions between subfamilies within Germanic are rarely precisely defined, because most form continuous clines, with adjacent [[dialect]]s being mutually intelligible and more separated ones not. In particular, there has never been an original \"[[Proto-language|Proto-High German]]\". For this and other reasons, the idea of representing the relationships between [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] language forms in a tree diagram at all is controversial among linguists.

''Starstone World'' has never been published in book form; it is believed that magazine text was cut for publication, and Bok's full-length manuscript has been lost.]]\n'''Hannes Bok''', pseudonym for '''Wayne Francis Woodard''' (July 2, 1914 \u2013 April 11, 1964), was an [[American people|American]] artist and illustrator, as well as an amateur astrologer and writer of fantasy fiction and poetry. He painted nearly 150 covers for various science fiction, fantasy, and detective fiction magazines, as well as contributing hundreds of black and white interior illustrations. Bok's work graced the pages of calendars and early fanzines, as well as dust jackets from specialty book publishers like [[Arkham House]], Llewellyn, [[Shasta Publishers]], and [[Fantasy Press]]. His paintings achieved a luminous quality through the use of an arduous glazing process, which was learned from his mentor, [[Maxfield Parrish]]. Bok shared one of the inaugural 1953 [[Hugo Awards]] for science fiction achievement (best Cover Artist).<ref name=SFAwards/>\n\nToday, Bok is best known for his cover art which appeared on various [[pulp magazines|pulp]] and [[science fiction magazine]]s, such as ''[[Weird Tales]]'', ''Famous Fantastic Mysteries'', ''[[Other Worlds (magazine)|Other Worlds]]'', ''Super Science Stories'', ''[[Imagination (magazine)|Imagination]]'', ''Fantasy Fiction'', ''[[Planet Stories]],'' ''[[If (magazine)|If]]'', ''[[Castle of Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]''.\n\n==Life and career==\n[[File:Cosmic Science-Fiction May 1941.jpg|left|thumb|Cover of the May 1941 issue of ''Cosmic Science-Fiction'', by Bok.]]\nWayne Woodard (the name is sometimes mistakenly rendered as \"Woodward\") was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. His parents divorced when he was five; and his father and stepmother, strict disciplinarians, discouraged his artistic efforts. Once he graduated high school, in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], Bok cut off contact with his father and moved to [[Seattle]] to live with his mother. There he became active in SF fandom, including the publication and illustration of fanzines. It was in connection with these activities that he originated his pseudonym, first \"Hans\", then \"Hannes\", Bok. The pseudonym derives from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (whose name can be rendered both as \"Johann S. Bach\" and \"Johannes Bach\").\n\nIn 1937, Bok moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he met [[Ray Bradbury]]. In 1938, he relocated to Seattle \u2013 where he worked for the W.P.A. and became acquainted with artists like [[Mark Tobey]] and [[Morris Graves]]. Late in 1939, Bok moved to New York City in order to be closer to the editors and magazines which would publish his work, and where he became a member of the influential [[Futurians]] science fiction fans.<ref name=pohl1/> Bok had corresponded with and had met [[Maxfield Parrish]] (ca. 1939?), and the influence of Parrish's art on Bok's is evident in his choice of subject matter, use of color, and application of glazes. Bok was also homosexual, according to friends [[Forrest J Ackerman]] and [[Emil Petaja]]; the erotic fantasy elements of his artwork, especially his male nude subjects, display homoerotic overtones unusual for the time.\n\nLike his contemporary [[Virgil Finlay]], Hannes Bok broke into commercial art and achieved initial career success as a ''Weird Tales'' artist \u2013 though he did so through one of the stranger events in the history of science fiction and fantasy. In the summer of 1939, [[Ray Bradbury]] carried samples of Bok's art eastward to introduce his friend's work to magazine editors at the [[1st World Science Fiction Convention|first World Science Fiction Convention]].<ref name=pohl1/> This was a bold move, since Bradbury was a neophyte with no connections to commercial art or the magazine industry; but it reflects the close ties within the [[science fiction fandom|fan]] and professional community. Bradbury was, at the time, a 19-year-old newspaper seller, and he borrowed funds for the trip from fellow science fiction fan [[Forrest J Ackerman]]. Bradbury succeeded; [[Farnsworth Wright]], editor of ''[[Weird Tales]]'', accepted Bok's art, which debuted in the December 1939 issue of ''Weird Tales''. More than 50 issues of the magazine featured Bok's pen-and-ink work until March 1954. Bok also executed six color covers for ''Weird Tales'' between March 1940 and March 1942. ''Weird Tales'' also published five of Bok's stories and two of his poems between 1942 and 1951. Once he broke through into professional publications, Bok moved to New York City and lived there the rest of his life.\n\nThroughout his life, Bok was deeply interested in astrology, as well as in the music of the Finnish composer [[Jean Sibelius]], with whom Bok had a correspondence. (Bok's copy of Karl Ekman's ''Jean Sibelius: His Life and Personality'' [Knopf, 1938], for example, is annotated with Bok's comments and astrological charts.) As the years passed, Bok became prone to disagreements with editors over money and artistic issues; he grew reclusive and mystical, and preoccupied with the occult. He eked out a living, often in near poverty, until his death in 1964. He died, apparently of a heart attack (he \"starved to death\" according to Ackerman), at the age of 49.<ref name=pohl2/> ISFDB catalogs only a few 1956 interior illustrations after March 1954, his last for ''Weird Tales'', and only two cover illustrations after January 1957.<ref name=isfdb/>\n\n==Bok as an author==\nAs an author, Bok is best known for his novels ''[[The Sorcerer's Ship]]'', originally published in the December 1942 issue of John W. Campell's fantasy magazine ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]''; and ''The Blue Flamingo/Beyond the Golden Stair.'' ''The Blue Flamingo'' first appeared in the January 1948 issue of ''[[Startling Stories]].'' Bok later performed an extensive revision and expansion of this work, published posthumously as ''[[Beyond the Golden Stair]]'' (1970). Both novels have been re-issued in the [[Ballantine Adult Fantasy series]]. Bok also was allowed to complete two novellas left unfinished by [[A. Merritt]] at the time of his death in 1943. These were published as ''[[The Blue Pagoda]]'' (1946) and ''[[The Black Wheel]]'' (1947). (Bok's commitment to fantasy and science fiction had occurred in 1927 in connection with Merritt's ''[[The Moon Pool]]'' in ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' \u2013 one of those conversion experiences common among young SF fans.) Also published posthumously was a collection of Bok's poetry, ''[[Spinner of Silver and Thistle]]'' (1972).\n\n==Bok as an artist==\n[[File:Future Fantasy and Science Fiction October 1942.jpg|thumb|right|Bok's \"Beauty\" was the cover story for the October 1942 issue of ''[[Future Science Fiction and Science Fiction Stories|Future]]'', and Bok himself painted the cover illustration]]\n[[File:Weird Tales March 1940.jpg|thumb|right|Bok's cover for the March 1940 ''Weird Tales'', illustrating Clyde Irvine's \"The Horror in the Glen\"]]\n\nBok is better known for his art than for his fiction. His style could alternate between, or combine, lush romanticism and humorous grotesquery. His use of time-consuming glazing techniques for his paintings impeded his productivity and limited his output, and therefore his commercial success. He also spent time carving figures in wood and making masks in ''[[papier mache]].'' In the 1950s he was able to do more book-jacket illustrations, which he found less irksome than magazine work; though he could never have abandoned the latter. His striking wraparound cover for the November 1963 issue of ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', illustrating Roger Zelazny's \"[[A Rose for Ecclesiastes]]\", was published in the last months of his life.\n\nBok and [[Ed Emshwiller]] shared one of the inaugural [[Hugo Awards]] for science fiction achievement in 1953, as the previous year's best \"Cover Artist\" (a tie); [[Virgil Finlay]] was recognized as the best \"Interior Illustrator\". Cover and interior illustration were not thereafter distinguished by the [[Hugo Award for Best Artist]] under various names.<ref name=SFAwards/>\n\n==Bok and Emil Petaja==\n\nThe science fiction and fantasy author [[Emil Petaja]] (1915\u20132000) was lifelong friend of Bok and collector of his work. After Bok's death, Petaja did as much as anyone to keep the artist's work before the public eye.\n\nBok and Petaja first met in the summer of 1936. According to Petaja, Bok and his friend Harold Taves were hitch-hiking from Seattle to New York City when they stopped off in [[Montana|Montana, USA]], to see the aspiring writer. At first correspondents, Bok and Petaja soon became close friends. The two had much in common \u2013 including an interest in fantasy fiction, the [[Kalevala]] (the Finnish verse epic), and the music of Sibelius.\n\nPetaja's first book, ''Brief Candle'' (1936), contained twelve poems by Petaja and twelve illustrations by Bok. Petaja printed this now rare chapbook by running-off copies on the mimeograph machines at [[Bozeman Campus, Montana State University, USA|Bozeman Campus, Montana State University]], where he was a student in creative writing. According to Petaja, approximately 40 to 50 copies were printed with many \"given to friends and well wishers.\"\n\nBok and Petaja's friendship continued in Los Angeles, where each had relocated in 1937. Throughout 1937 and 1938, Petaja and Bok shared an apartment, and together they attended fan meetings, haunted second-hand book and magazine shops, went to the movies, and helped each other with their poems and stories. They also immersed themselves in the primordial Los Angeles science fiction scene. Bok and Petaja befriended Ray Bradbury \u2013 then still a teenager \u2013 as well as Forrest J. Ackerman, [[Henry Kuttner]] and others.\n[[File:Other worlds science stories 195105.jpg|left|thumb|160px|1951 Bok illustration]]\n\nIn ''And Flights of Angels'', Petaja recounts: \"Perhaps when all is washed down over the dam, my major claim to fame will rest in the fact that it was I who got Hannes down to Los Angeles and I who dragged him, reluctantly, to the meetings of the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society. Where we met Ray Bradbury. . . . It was at Clifton's Cafeteria on Broadway. We couldn't afford to eat there, usually, but we took advantage of the free lime sherbet. In that fabled back room where so many of the s-f elite have sat around the long table chewing the fat, fanwize, Hannes first met Forrie Ackerman, Henry Kuttner, et al. But it was Ray Bradbury who took to Hannes instanter and proved to be such a rare and wonderful friend to him a little later on.\"\n\n\"Besides introducing Hannes to Ray Bradbury, I take pride in the fact that this brief Los Angeles period of Bok's life was one of the most productive of his life. He produced a dozen color paintings based on [[Peer Gynt]], as samples to show book publishers what he could do. He painted \"The Mermaid\" and several Enchanted City themes. He wrote scads of poetry. All of which does indicate that, for all his beefs, he was happy then. He might lash out cruelly about this or that, but nobody I have known had as great a capacity for enjoying and sensating all there was around him.\"\n\nIn 1967, three years after Bok's death, Petaja founded the Bokanalia Memorial Foundation. The foundation was set up \"with the help and encouragement of Harold Taves of Seattle and Ray Bradbury of Los Angeles and the Golden Gate Futurians of San Francisco . . . . The avowed intention of Bokanalia is simply to keep the great imaginative art of Hannes Bok from slipping into oblivion, and to make new (better than pulp) prints available to his many admirers all over the world\".\n\nBetween 1967 and 1970, Petaja published five portfolios of Bok's art. Those portfolios include ''Variations on Bok Theme'', (black & white portfolio, 1967); ''The Famous Power Series'', (black & white portfolio, with text by Bok, 1969); and ''A Memorial Portfolio'', (color portfolio, with booklet with text by Petaja, 1970). Petaja also authored a commemorative volume, ''And Flights of Angels: The Life and Legend of Hannes Bok'' (Bokanalia Memorial Foundation, 1968). Along with brief contributions from [[Roger Zelazny]], [[Jack Gaughan]], [[Donald Wollheim]] and others, ''And Flights of Angels'' contains Petaja's long biographical essay on the artist, a checklist of Bok's published artwork and writings, and reproductions of a substantial number of the artist's drawings, prints and illustrations. Later, under the SISU imprint (and on behalf of the Bokanalia Foundation), Petaja published an illustrated volume of Bok's poetry, ''Spinner of Silver and Thistle'' (1972), as well as editing ''The Hannes Bok Memorial Showcase of Fantasy Art'' (1974).\n\nMuch of the Bok material included in the portfolios and books published and authored by Petaja came from Petaja's personal collection. Petaja owned at least a dozen paintings, as well as dozens of sketches, drawings, prints and three-dimensional objects. Among Petaja's most beloved possessions was the first sketch Bok ever drew for him, a piece from 1936 called \"Gleef,\" which hung on the wall of Petaja's [[San Francisco]] home. Petaja also collected examples of Bok's published work \u2013 such as magazine covers, interior illustrations, dust jackets, book covers, and more. Additionally, Petaja amassed Bok manuscripts (both published and unpublished fiction and poetry), as well as letters, books, other printed matter and unique, one-of-a-kind objects.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar |Speculative fiction |Visual arts }} <!-- delete \"bar\" if/when there are enough ordinary See also -->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist |25em |refs=\n<!-- it appears that the two-part article by Pohl has been used again and again with only a single attribution at the end, Bok's death at 49 -- I inserted two superscript calls to the first one without doing much work if any -->\n<ref name=pohl1>\n[http://www.thewaythefutureblogs.com/2011/09/hannes-bok-futurian-artist-in-chief/ \"Hannes Bok: Futurian Artist in Chief\"].

The word ''homomorphism'' comes from the [[ancient Greek language]]: ''[[wikt:\u1f41\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2|\u1f41\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2]] (homos)'' meaning \"same\" and ''[[wikt:\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03ae|\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03ae]] (morphe)'' meaning \"form\" or \"shape\".

This generalization is the starting point of [[category theory]].\n\nA homomorphism may also be an [[isomorphism]], an [[endomorphism]], an [[automorphism]], etc. (see below). Each of those can be defined in a way that may be generalized to any class of morphisms.\n\n== Definition ==\nA homomorphism is a map between two [[algebraic structure]]s of the same type (that is of the same name), that preserves the [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] of the structures. This means a [[map (mathematics)|map]] <math>f: A\\to B</math> between two [[set (mathematics)|sets]] {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|B}} equipped with the same structure such that, if {{math|\u2217}} is an operation of the structure (supposed here, for simplification, to be a [[binary operation]]), then\n:<math>f(x*y)=f(x)*f(y)</math>\nfor every pair {{math|''x'', ''y''}} of elements of {{math|''A''}}.<ref group=note>As it is often the case, but not always, the same symbol for the operation of both {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} was used here.</ref> One says often that {{math|''f''}} preserves the operation or is compatible with the operation.\n\nFormally, a map <math>f: A\\to B</math> preserves an operation {{math|''\u03bc''}} of [[arity]] {{math|''k''}}, defined on both {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} if \n:<math>f(\\mu_A(a_1, \\ldots, a_k)) = \\mu_B(f(a_1), \\ldots, f(a_k)),</math> \nfor all elements {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>}} in {{math|''A''}}.\n\nThe operations that must be preserved by a homomorphism include [[0-ary function|0-ary operations]], that is the constants. In particular, when an [[identity element]] is required by the type of structure, the identity element of the first structure must be mapped to the corresponding identity element of the second structure.\n\nFor example:\n\n* A [[semigroup homomorphism]] is a map between [[semigroup]]s that preserves the semigroup operation.\n* A [[monoid homomorphism]] is a map between [[monoid]]s that preserves the monoid operation and maps the identity element of the first monoid to that of the second monoid (the identity element is a [[0-ary function|0-ary operation]]).\n* A [[group homomorphism]] is a map between [[group (mathematics)|groups]] that preserves the group operation. This implies that the group homomorphism maps the identity element of the first group to the identity element of the second group, and maps the [[inverse element|inverse]] of an element of the first group  to the inverse of the image of this element. Thus a semigroup homomorphism between groups is necessarily a group homomorphism.\n* A [[ring homomorphism]] is a map between [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] that preserves the ring addition, the ring multiplication, and the [[multiplicative identity]]. Whether the multiplicative identity is to be preserved depends upon the definition of ''ring'' in use. If the multiplicative identity is not preserved, one has a [[rng (algebra)|rng]] homomorphism.\n* A [[linear map]] is a homomorphism of [[vector space]], That is a group homomorphism between vector spaces that preserves the abelian group structure and [[scalar multiplication]].\n* A [[module homomorphism]], also called a linear map between [[module (mathematics)|modules]], is defined similarly.\n* An [[algebra homomorphism]] is a map that preserves the [[algebra over a field|algebra]] operations.\n\nAn algebraic structure may have more than one operation, and a homomorphism is required to preserve each operation. Thus a map that preserves only some of the operations is not a homomorphism of the structure, but only a homomorphism of the substructure obtained by considering only the preserved operations. For example, a map between monoids that preserves the monoid operation and not the identity element, is not a monoid homomorphism, but only a semigroup homomorphism.\n\nThe notation for the operations does not need to be the same in the source and the target of a homomorphism. For example, the [[real number]]s form a group for addition, and the positive real numbers form a group for multiplication. The [[exponential function]] \n:<math>x\\mapsto e^x</math>\nsatisfies\n:<math>e^{x+y} = e^xe^y,</math>\nand is thus a homomorphism between these two groups. It is even an isomorphism (see below), as its [[inverse function]], the [[natural logarithm]], satisfies \n:<math>\\ln(xy)=\\ln(x)+\\ln(y), </math>\nand is also a group homomorphism.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n[[File:Exponentiation as monoid homomorphism svg.svg|thumb|x200px|[[Monoid]] homomorphism {{math|''f''}} from the monoid {{math|{{color|#008000|('''N''', +, 0)}}}} to the monoid {{math|{{color|#800000|('''N''', \u00d7, 1)}}}}, defined by {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 2<sup>''x''</sup>}}.

The set of all 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2&nbsp;[[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] is also a ring, under [[matrix addition]] and [[matrix multiplication]].  If we define a function between these rings as follows:\n:<math>f(r) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   r & 0 \\\\\n   0 & r\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nwhere {{mvar|r}} is a real number, then {{mvar|f}} is a homomorphism of rings, since {{mvar|f}} preserves both addition:\n:<math>f(r+s) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  r+s & 0 \\\\\n   0 & r+s\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  r & 0 \\\\\n   0 & r\n\\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}\n   s & 0 \\\\\n   0 & s\n\\end{pmatrix} = f(r) + f(s)</math>\nand multiplication:\n:<math>f(rs) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  rs & 0 \\\\\n   0 & rs\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   r & 0 \\\\\n   0 & r\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n   s & 0 \\\\\n   0 & s\n\\end{pmatrix} = f(r)\\,f(s).</math>\n\nFor another example, the nonzero [[complex number]]s form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under the operation of multiplication, as do the nonzero real numbers.  (Zero must be excluded from both groups since it does not have a [[multiplicative inverse]], which is required for elements of a group.)  Define a function {{math|''f''}} from the nonzero complex numbers to the nonzero real numbers by\n:<math>f(z) = |z| .</math>\nThat is, {{math|''f''(''z'')}} is the [[absolute value]] (or modulus) of the complex number {{math|''z''}}.  Then {{math|''f''}} is a homomorphism of groups, since it preserves multiplication:\n:<math>f(z_1 z_2) = |z_1 z_2| = |z_1| |z_2| = f(z_1) f(z_2) .</math>\nNote that {{math|''f''}} cannot be extended to a homomorphism of rings (from the complex numbers to the real numbers), since it does not preserve addition:\n:<math>|z_1 + z_2| \\ne |z_1| + |z_2| .</math>\n\nAs another example, the diagram shows a [[monoid]] homomorphism {{math|''f''}} from the monoid {{math|('''N''', +, 0)}} to the monoid {{math|('''N''', \u00d7, 1)}}. Due to the different names of corresponding operations, the structure preservation properties satisfied by {{math|''f''}} amount to {{math|1=''f''(''x'' + ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') \u00d7 ''f''(''y'')}} and {{math|1=''f''(0) = 1}}.\n\nA [[composition algebra]] {{math|''A''}} over a field {{math|''F''}} has a [[quadratic form]], called a ''norm'', {{math|''N'' : ''A'' \u2192 ''F''}}, which is a group homomorphism from the [[multiplicative group]] of {{math|''A''}} to the multiplicative group of {{math|''F''}}.\n\n== Special homomorphisms ==\nSeveral kinds of homomorphisms have a specific name, which is also defined for general [[morphism]]s.\n\n=== Isomorphism ===\nAn [[isomorphism]] between [[algebraic structure]]s of the same type is commonly defined as a [[bijective]] homomorphism.<ref name=\"Birkhoff.1967\">{{Citation | last1=Birkhoff | first1=Garrett | title=Lattice theory | origyear=1940 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | edition=3rd | series=American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publications | isbn=978-0-8218-1025-5 | mr=598630 | year=1967 | volume=25}}</ref>{{rp|134}} <ref name=\"Burris.Sankappanavar.2012\">{{cite book | url=http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snburris/htdocs/UALG/univ-algebra2012.pdf | isbn=978-0-9880552-0-9 | author1=Stanley N.

In the specific case of algebraic structures, the two definitions are equivalent, although they may differ for non-algebraic structures, which have an underlying set.\n\nMore precisely, if \n:<math>f: A\\to B</math>\nis a (homo)morphism, it has an inverse if there exists a homomorphism\n:<math>g: B\\to A</math>\nsuch that\n:<math>f\\circ g = \\operatorname{Id}_B \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad g\\circ f = \\operatorname{Id}_A.</math>\n\nIf {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} have underlying sets, and <math>f: A\\to B</math> has an inverse {{math|''g''}}, then {{math|''f''}} is bijective. In fact, {{math|''f''}} is [[injective]], as {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y'')}} implies {{math|1=''x'' = ''g''(''f''(x)) = ''g''(''f''(y)) = ''y''}}, and  {{math|''f''}} is [[surjective]], as, for any {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''B''}}, one has  {{math|1=''x'' = ''f''(''g''(''x''))}}, and {{math|''x''}} is the image of an element of {{math|''A''}}.\n\nConversely, if <math>f: A\\to B</math> is a bijective homomorphism between algebraic structures, let <math>g: B\\to A</math> be the map such that {{math|''g''(''y'')}} is the unique element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''A''}} such that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}}. One has <math>f\\circ g = \\operatorname{Id}_B \\text{ and } g\\circ f = \\operatorname{Id}_A,</math> and it remains only to show that {{math|''g''}} is a homomorphism. If <math>*</math> is a binary operation of the structure, for every pair {{math|''x'', ''y''}} of elements of {{math|''B''}}, one has\n:<math>g(x*_B y) = g(f(g(x))*_Bf(g(y))) = g(f(g(x)*_A g(y))) = g(x)*_A g(y),</math>\nand {{math|''g''}} is thus compatible with <math>*.</math> As the proof is similar for any [[arity]], this shows that {{math|''g''}} is a homomorphism.\n\nThis proof does not work for non-algebraic structures. For examples, for [[topological space]]s, a morphism is a [[continuous map]], and the inverse of a bijective continuous map needs not to be continuous. An isomorphism of topological spaces, called [[homeomorphism]] or [[bicontinuous function|bicontinuous map]], is thus a bijective continuous map, whose inverse is also continuous.\n\n===Endomorphism===\nAn [[endomorphism]] is a homomorphism whose [[domain of a function|domain]] equals the [[codomain]], or, more generally, a [[morphism]] whose source is equal to the target.<ref name=\"Birkhoff.1967\"/>{{rp|135}}\n\nThe endomorphisms of an algebraic structure, or of an object of a [[category (mathematics)|category]] form a [[monoid]] under composition.\n\nThe endomorphisms of a [[vector space]] or of a [[module (mathematics)|module]] form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].

More precisely, they are equivalent for [[field (mathematics)|fields]], for which every homomorphism is a monomorphism, and for [[variety (universal algebra)|varieties]] of [[universal algebra]], that is algebraic structures for which operations and axioms (identities) are defined without any restriction (fields are not a variety, as the [[multiplicative inverse]] is defined either as a [[unary operation]] or as a property of the multiplication, which are, in both cases, defined only for nonzero elements).\n\nIn particular, the two definitions of a monomorphism are equivalent for [[set (mathematics)|sets]], [[magma (algebra)|magmas]], [[semigroup]]s, [[monoid]]s, [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[vector space]]s and [[module (mathematics)|modules]].\n\nA '''[[split monomorphism]]''' is a homomorphism that has a [[inverse function|right inverse]].

For sets and vector spaces, every monomorphism is a split homomorphism, but this property does not hold for most common algebraic structures.\n\n{{cot|Proof of the equivalence of the two definitions of monomorphisms}}\n''An injective homomorphism is left cancelable'': If <math>f\\circ g = f\\circ h,</math> one has <math>f(g(x))=f(h(x))</math> for every {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''C''}}, the common source of {{math|''g''}} and {{math|''h''}}. If {{math|''f''}} is injective, then {{math|1=''g''(''x'') = ''h''(''x'')}}, and thus {{math|1=''g'' = ''h''}}. This proof works not only for algebraic structures, but also for any [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose objects are sets and arrows are maps between these sets. For example, an injective continuous map is a monomorphism in the category of [[topological space]]s.\n\nFor proving that, conversely, a left cancelable homomorphism is injective, it is useful to consider a ''[[free object]] on {{math|''x''}}''. Given a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of algebraic structures a free object on {{math|''x''}} is a pair consisting of an algebraic structure {{math|''L''}} of this variety and an element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''L''}} satisfying the following [[universal property]]: for every structure {{math|''S''}} of the variety, and every element {{math|''s''}} of {{math|''S''}}, there is a unique homomorphism <math>f: L\\to S</math> such that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''s''}}. For example, for sets, the free object on {{math|''x''}} is simply {{math|{''x''}{{void}}}}; for [[semigroup]]s, the free object on {{math|''x''}} is <math>\\{x, x^2, \\ldots, x^n, \\ldots\\},</math> which, as, a semigroup, is isomorphic to the additive semigroup of the positive integers; for [[monoid]]s, the free object on {{math|''x''}} is <math>\\{1, x, x^2, \\ldots, x^n, \\ldots\\},</math> which, as, a monoid, is isomorphic to the additive monoid of the nonnegative integers; for [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, the free object on {{math|''x''}} is the [[infinite cyclic group]] <math>\\{\\ldots, x^{-n}, \\ldots, x^{-1}, 1, x, x^2, \\ldots, x^n, \\ldots\\},</math> which, as, a group, is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers; for [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], the free object on {{math|''x''}} is the [[polynomial ring]] <math>\\Bbb{Z}[x];</math> for [[vector space]]s or [[module (mathematics)|modules]], the free object on {{math|''x''}} is the vector space or free module that has {{math|''x''}} as a basis.\n\n''If a free object over {{math|''x''}} exists, then every left cancelable homomorphism is injective'': let <math>f\\colon A \\to B</math> be a left cancelable homomorphism, and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} be two elements of {{math|''A''}} such {{math|1=''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''b'')}}. By definition of the free object {{math|''F''}}, there exist homomorphisms {{math|''g''}} and {{math|''h''}} from {{math|''F''}} to {{math|''A''}} such that {{math|1=''g''(''x'') = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''h''(''x'') = ''b''}}. As {{math|1=''f''(''g''(''x'') = ''f''(''h''(''x'') }}, one has <math>f\\circ g = f\\circ h, </math> by the uniqueness in the definition of a universal property. As {{math|''f''}} is left cancelable, one has {{math|1=''g'' = ''h''}}, and thus {{math|1=''a'' = ''b''}}. Therefore, {{math|''f''}} is injective.\n\n''Existence of a free object on {{math|x}} for a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]]'' (see also {{slink|Free object|Existence}}): For building a free object over {{math|''x''}}, let us consider the set {{math|''W''}} of the [[well-formed formula]]s built up from {{math|''x''}} and the operations of the structure. Two such formulas are said equivalent if one may pass from one to the other by applying the axioms ([[identity (mathematics)|identities]] of the structure). This defines an [[equivalence relation]], if the identities are not subject to conditions, that is if one works with a variety. Then the operations of the variety are well defined on the set of [[equivalence class]]es of {{math|''W''}} for this relation. It is straightforward to show that the resulting object is a free object on {{math|''W''}}.\n{{cob}}\n\n===Epimorphism===\n\nIn [[algebra]], '''epimorphisms''' are often defined as [[surjective]] homomorphisms.<ref name=\"Birkhoff.1967\"/>{{rp|134}}<ref name=\"Burris.Sankappanavar.2012\" />{{rp|43}} On the other hand, in [[category theory]], [[epimorphism]]s are defined as '''right cancelable'''.<ref name=workmath/> This means that a (homo)morphism <math>f:A\\to B</math> is an epimorphism if, for any pair {{math|''g'', ''h''}} of morphisms from {{math|''B''}} to any other object {{math|''C''}}, the equality <math>g\\circ f = h\\circ f</math> implies {{math|1=''g'' = ''h''}}.\n\nA surjective homomorphism is always right cancelable, but the converse is not always true for algebraic structures.

The most basic example is the inclusion of [[integer]]s into [[rational number]]s, which is an homomorphism of rings and of multiplicative semigroups. For both structures it is a monomorphism and a non-surjective epimorphism, but not an isomorphism.<ref name=workmath/><ref>{{cite book | page=363 | title=Hopf Algebra: An Introduction | zbl=0962.16026 | series=Pure and Applied Mathematics | volume=235 | location=New York, NY | publisher=Marcel Dekker | first1=Sorin | last1=D\u0103sc\u0103lescu | first2=Constantin | last2=N\u0103st\u0103sescu | first3=\u015eerban | last3=Raianu | year=2001 | isbn=0824704819 }}</ref>\n\nA wide generalization of this example is the [[localization of a ring]] by a multiplicative set. Every localization is a ring epimorphism, which is not, in general, surjective. As localizations are fundamental in [[commutative algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]], this may explain why in these areas, the definition of epimorphisms as right cancelable homomorphisms is generally preferred.\n\nA '''[[split epimorphism]]''' is a homomorphism that has a [[inverse function|left inverse]]. That is, a homomorphism <math>f\\colon A \\to B</math> is a split epimorphism if there exists a homomorphism <math>g\\colon B \\to A</math> such that <math>f\\circ g = \\operatorname{Id}_B.</math> A split epimorphism is always an epimorphism, for both meanings of ''epimorphism''. For sets and vector spaces, every epimorphism is a split epimorphism, but this property does not hold for most common algebraic structures.\n\nIn summary, one has \n:<math>\\text {split epimorphism} \\implies \\text{epimorphism (surjective)}\\implies \\text {epimorphism (right cancelable)};</math> \nthe last implication is an equivalence for sets, vector spaces, modules and abelian groups; the first implication is an equivalence for sets and vector spaces.\n{{cot|Equivalence of the two definitions of epimorphism}}\nLet <math>f\\colon A \\to B</math> be a homomorphism. We want to prove that if it is not surjective, it is not right cancelable.\n\nIn the case of sets, let {{math|''b''}} be an element of {{math|''B''}} that not belongs to {{math|''f''(''A'')}}, and define <math>g,h\\colon B\\to B</math> such that {{math|''g''}} is the [[identity function]], and that {{math|1=''h''(''x'') = ''x''}} for every <math>x\\in B,</math> except that {{math|''h''(''b'')}} is any other element of {{math|''B''}}. Clearly {{math|''f''}} is not right cancelable, as {{math|''g'' \u2260 ''h''}} and <math>g\\circ f = h\\circ f.</math>\n\nIn the case of vector spaces, abelian groups and modules, the proof relies on the existence of [[cokernel]]s and on the fact that the [[zero map]]s are homomorphisms: let {{math|''C''}} be the cokernel of {{math|''f''}}, and <math>g\\colon B\\to C</math> be the canonical map, such that {{math|1=''g''(''f''(''A'')) = 0}}. Let <math>g\\colon B\\to C</math> be the zero map. If {{math|''f''}} is not surjective, {{math|''C'' \u2260 0}}, and thus {{math|''g'' \u2260 ''h''}} (one is a zero map, while the other is not). Thus {{math|''f''}} is not cancelable, as <math>g\\circ f = h\\circ f</math> (both are the zero map from {{math|''A''}} to {{math|''C''}}).\n{{cob}}\n\n== Kernel ==\n{{main|Kernel (algebra)}}\n\nAny homomorphism {{math|''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} defines an [[equivalence relation]] {{math|~}} on {{math|''X''}} by {{math|''a'' ~ ''b''}} if and only if {{math|1=''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''b'')}}. The relation {{math|~}} is called the '''kernel''' of {{math|''f''}}. It is a [[congruence relation]] on {{math|''X''}}. The [[quotient set]] {{math|''X'' / ~}} can then be given a structure of the same type, in a natural way, by defining the operations as {{math|1=[''x''] \u2217 [''y''] =  [''x'' \u2217 ''y'']}}. In that case the image of {{math|''X''}} in {{math|''Y''}} under the homomorphism {{math|''f''}} is necessarily [[isomorphic]] to {{math|''X'' / ~}}; this fact is one of the [[isomorphism theorem]]s.\n\nWhen the algebraic structure is a  [[group (mathematics)|group]] for some operation, the [[equivalence class]] {{math|''K''}} of the [[identity element]] of this operation suffices to characterize the equivalence relation. In this case, the quotient by the equivalence relation is denoted by {{math|''X''/''K''}} (usually read as \"{{math|''X''}} [[Ideal (ring theory)|mod]] {{math|''K''}}\"). Also in this case, it is {{math|''K''}}, rather than {{math|~}}, that is called the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of {{math|''f''}}. The kernels of homomorphisms of a given type of algebraic structure are naturally equipped with some structure. This structure type of the kernels is the same as the considered structure, in the case of [[abelian group]]s, [[vector space]]s and [[module (mathematics)|modules]], but is different and has received a specific name in other cases, such as [[normal subgroup]] for kernels of [[group homomorphisms]] and [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] for kernels of [[ring homomorphism]]s (in the case of non-commutative rings, the kernels are the [[two-sided ideal]]s).\n\n== Relational structures ==\n\nIn [[model theory]], the notion of an algebraic structure is generalized to structures involving both operations and relations. Let ''L'' be a signature consisting of function and relation symbols, and ''A'', ''B'' be two ''L''-structures. Then a '''homomorphism''' from ''A'' to ''B'' is a mapping ''h'' from the domain of ''A'' to the domain of ''B'' such that\n* ''h''(''F''<sup>''A''</sup>(''a''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)) = ''F''<sup>''B''</sup>(''h''(''a''<sub>1</sub>),\u2026,''h''(''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)) for each ''n''-ary function symbol ''F'' in ''L'',\n* ''R''<sup>''A''</sup>(''a''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) implies ''R''<sup>''B''</sup>(''h''(''a''<sub>1</sub>),\u2026,''h''(''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)) for each ''n''-ary relation symbol ''R'' in ''L''.\nIn the special case with just one binary relation, we obtain the notion of a [[graph homomorphism]].

Hence ''w'' = 0 and ''h''(''e'') has null length.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Continuous function]]\n* [[Diffeomorphism]]\n* [[Homomorphic encryption]]\n* [[Homomorphic secret sharing]] \u2013 a simplistic decentralized voting protocol\n* [[Morphism]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Morphisms]]", "sha1": "hsc01sa0281pz9z4uxvsf923oopcp1g"}}, {"title": "History of computers", "ns": "0", "id": "13565", "redirect": {"title": "History of computing hardware"}, "revision": {"id": "15911164", "parentid": "2018410", "timestamp": "2003-12-22T02:46:36Z", "contributor": {"username": "Cyan", "id": "9503"}, "minor": "", "comment": "I'm putting the redirect back until the deletion goes through...", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[History of computing hardware]]", "sha1": "176n3bi0g09nz3a8dxei7v9d2m8zfbh"}}, {"title": "HYPERCARD", "ns": "0", "id": "13566", "redirect": {"title": "HyperCard"}, "revision": {"id": "783863747", "parentid": "290580001", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T04:01:29Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[HyperCard]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from other capitalisation}}\n}}", "sha1": "38wir87fl6g2ha98vz48j0ux0tufmgy"}}, {"title": "HyperCard", "ns": "0", "id": "13567", "revision": {"id": "863926886", "parentid": "861046696", "timestamp": "2018-10-14T00:28:51Z", "contributor": {"username": "Joe Vitale 5", "id": "20685249"}, "minor": "", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox software\n| name = HyperCard\n| logo = HyperCard 2-icon.png<!-- Image name is enough -->\n| logo alt = \n| screenshot = <!-- Image name is enough -->\n| caption = \n| screenshot alt = \n| collapsible = \n| author = [[Bill Atkinson]]\n| developer = [[Apple Inc.]] (formerly Apple Computer, Inc.)\n| released = {{Start date and age|1987}}<ref name=macgui4987>{{Citation |url= http://macgui.com/usenet/?group=14&id=4987 |title= Hypercard \u2013 How About New Mac Owners |newspaper= Mac GUI}}</ref>\n| discontinued = yes\n| latest release version = 2.4.1\n| latest release date = {{Start date and age|1998}}\n| status = Historic \n| programming language = [[Apple Pascal]]\n| operating system = [[Macintosh]]: [[System 6]], [[System 7]], [[Mac OS 8]], [[Mac OS 9]]<br />[[Apple IIGS]]: [[Apple GS/OS|GS/OS]] 5 & 6\n| platform = [[Macintosh]], [[Apple IIGS]]\n| size = \n| language = English\n| genre = [[Hypermedia]], [[software development]]\n| license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]]\n| AsOf = \n}}\n'''HyperCard''' was a piece of [[application software]] and a [[programming tool]] for Apple [[Macintosh]] and [[Apple IIGS]] computers. It was among the first successful [[hypermedia]] systems before the [[World Wide Web]].\n\nHyperCard combined a flat-file [[database]] with a graphical, flexible, user-modifiable interface.<ref name= currents>{{Citation |first= David |last= Needle |url= http://macgui.com/usenet/?group=14&id=4827 |title= HyperCard: Rumors or Reality |newspaper= Computer Currents |date= August 11, 1987}}</ref> HyperCard also included a built-in [[programming language]] called [[HyperTalk]] for manipulating data and the user interface.\n\nThis combination of features \u2013 a database with simple form layout, flexible support for graphics, and ease of programming \u2013 led many people to use HyperCard for many different projects. Some people used HyperCard as a programming tool for [[rapid application development]] of applications and databases, others for building interactive applications with no database requirements, command and control systems, and many examples in the [[demoscene]].\n\nHyperCard was originally released in 1987 for $49.95 and was included for free with all new Macs sold then.<ref name=macgui4987 /> It was withdrawn from sale in March 2004 after its final update in 1998. HyperCard ran in the [[Classic Environment]], but was not ported to [[macOS|Mac OS X]].\n\n==Similarities and differences to the World Wide Web==\n\nHyperCard influenced the development of the Web in late 1990 through its influence on [[Robert Cailliau]], who assisted in developing [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s first Web browser.<ref>[http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/People.html People involved in the WorldWideWeb project]</ref> Javascript was inspired by Hypertalk.<ref>Dr. Axel Rauschmayer, [http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch03.html Speaking JavaScript: An In-Depth Guide for Programmers] (O'Reilly, 2014)</ref>\n\nAlthough HyperCard stacks did not operate over the [[Internet]], by 1988, at least 300 stacks were publicly available for download from the commercial [[CompuServe]] network (which was not connected to the official Internet yet) and the system could link phone numbers on a user's computer together and enable them to dial numbers without a modem, using a less expensive piece of hardware, the Hyperdialer.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5z4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA37&lpg=RA1-PA37&dq=%22hypercard%22+compuserve&source=bl&ots=fsqeERAlfZ&sig=yf24VC_xecD0MXWZ5Y8PVVonHqk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMI46vgionxxwIVwSuICh2I_gpg#v=onepage&q=%22hypercard%22%20compuserve&f=false HyperCard:The First Eight Months], InfoWorld, 11 Apr 1988, page 37</ref>\n\nIn this sense, like the Web, it did form a brain-like association-based experience of information browsing via links, despite not operating remotely over the TCP/IP protocol then. Like the Web, it also allowed for the connections of many different kinds of media.\n\n==Description==\n\n===Design===\n[[File:Apple Macintosh SE-30 (1989).jpg|thumb|The Apple Macintosh SE/30 was one of the  computers that ran the HyperCard program.<ref>{{Citation|title= Apple Macintosh SE/30|url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_Macintosh_SE-30_(1989).jpg|date= 2011-01-07|access-date= 2015-11-16|first= Jeff Keyzer from Austin, TX|last= USA}}</ref>]]\nHyperCard is based on the concept of a \"stack\" of virtual \"cards\".<ref name=wired/> Cards hold data, just as they would in a [[Rolodex]] card-filing device. Each card contains a set of interactive objects, including text fields, check boxes, buttons, and similar common [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) elements. Users \"browse\" the stack by navigating from card to card, using built-in navigation features, a powerful search mechanism, or through user-created scripts.<ref name= info>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qjAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT60 \"A Hypercard Primer\"], ''InfoWorld'', November 6, 1989, p. S3 (sidebar)</ref>\n\nUsers build new stacks or modify extant ones by adding new cards. They place GUI objects on the cards using an interactive layout engine based on a simple drag-and-drop interface.<ref name= info/> Also, HyperCard included prototype or template cards termed ''backgrounds''; when new cards are created they can refer to one of these background cards, which causes all of the objects on the background to be copied onto the new card. This way, a stack of cards with a common layout and functionality can be created. The layout engine is similar in concept to a \"form\" as used in most [[rapid application development]] (RAD) environments (such as Borland [[Delphi (programming language)|Delphi]], and Microsoft [[Visual Basic]] and [[Visual Studio]]).\n\nThe database features of the HyperCard system are based on the storage of the state of all of the objects on the cards in the physical file representing the stack. The database did not exist as a separate system within the HyperCard stack; no [[database engine]] or similar construct exists. Instead, the state of any object in the system was considered to be live and editable at any time. From the HyperCard runtime's perspective, there was no difference between moving a text field on the card and typing into it, both operations simply changed the state of the target object within the stack. Such changes are immediately saved when complete, so typing into a field caused that text to be stored to the stack's physical file. The system operates in a largely stateless fashion, with no need to ''save'' during operation. This is in common with many database-oriented systems, although somewhat different from document-based applications.\n\nThe final key element in HyperCard was the ''script'', a single code-carrying element of every object within the stack. The script was a text field which contents were interpreted in the HyperTalk language (detailed below).<ref name=info/> Like any other property, the script of any object could be edited at any time and changes were saved as soon as they were complete. When the user invokes actions in the GUI, like clicking on a button or typing into a field, these actions are translated into ''events'' by the HyperCard runtime.  The runtime then examines the script of the object that was the target of the event, like a button, to see if its script object contains code for that event, code termed a ''handler''. If it does, the HyperTalk engine runs the handler, if it does not, the runtime examines other objects in the visual hierarchy.\n\n{{external media| float = right| width = 200px | video1 = [https://archive.org/details/CC501_hypercard \"HyperCard Mania!\" ''Computer Chronicles'', 1987] archive.org ([[Internet Archive]])\n}}\nThese concepts make up the majority of the HyperCard system; stacks, backgrounds and cards provide a form-like GUI system, the stack file provides [[object persistence]] and database-like functionality, and HyperTalk allows handlers to be written for GUI events. Unlike the majority of RAD or database systems of the era, however, HyperCard combined all of these features, both user-facing and developer-facing, in a single application. This allowed rapid turnaround and immediate prototyping, allowing users to author custom solutions to problems with their own personalized interface. \"Empowerment\" became a catchword as this possibility was embraced by the Macintosh community, as was the phrase \"programming for the rest of us\",<ref>{{Citation |first= Terry |last= Winograd |url= http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/bds/10p-prototype.html |chapter= HyperCard, Director, and Visual Basic |title= Bringing Design to Software |publisher= Addison-Wesley |year= 1996}}</ref> that is, anyone, not just professional programmers.\n\nIt was this combination of features that also made HyperCard a powerful [[hypermedia]] system. Users could build backgrounds to suit the needs of some system, say a [[rolodex]], and use simple HyperTalk commands to provide buttons to move from place to place within the stack, or provide the same navigation system within the data elements of the UI, like text fields. Using these features, it is easy to build linked systems similar to hypertext links on the Web.<ref name=wired/> Unlike the Web, programming, placement and browsing were all the same tool \u2013 similar systems have been created for HTML but traditional Web services are considerably more heavyweight.\n\n===HyperTalk===\n{{main|HyperTalk}}\nHyperCard contains an [[Object-oriented programming|object oriented]] [[scripting language]] called ''HyperTalk''. Objects exist in a message path hierarchy and respond to messages generated by either the user or the system (timers for instance). Objects inherit properties and attributes from those above them in the hierarchy.  HyperTalk object classes are predetermined by the HyperCard environment, although others can be added by the use of externals (see below). HyperTalk is verbose, hence its ease of use and readability. HyperTalk code segments are referred to as \"scripts\", a term that was considered less daunting to beginning programmers.\n\nEach HyperCard object class, contains a set of \"properties\". For example, buttons are a type of object, and come in standard styles. To determine, say, whether a checkbox style button is in fact checked, a script can simply call the <code>highlight</code> property,<ref name =\"hilitePropHyperTalkRef\">[http://hypercard.org/HyperTalk%20Reference%202.4.pdf \"HyperTalk Reference stack\"], ''Apple'', Page 278 (not to be confused with the \"checkMark\" property described on Page 260)</ref> which would return either true or false.  In a similar way, objects can be analyzed via functions. For example, the number of lines in text field (another type of object) can be determined by a variant of the <code>number</code> function, called simply as {{code|2=applescript|the number of lines of field 'fieldName'}}. This is very useful when performing a given action on each separate line of the field. The script that implements the action need only call the function to know exactly the number of lines it must process.  Should the field data change, the already coded function call will still be accurate.\n\nHyperTalk is a [[weak typing|weakly typed]] language. All variables, and in fact all values of any kind, are stored as typeless character strings handled by the interpreter as numbers or text based purely on context. This has a cost in speed. Variables need not be declared, but rather are created on the fly as they are required. For example, the following expression creates a variable named <code>total</code>, and sets its initial value: <code>put 15 into total</code>. Then the expression <code>add 3 to total</code> would result in the string <code>\"18\"</code> being stored in that variable. Taking this further, a powerful and intuitive structure known as \"chunking\" allows precise manipulation of text and number strings. It is possible, for example, to have the second character of the value <code>\"123\"</code> (the 2) added to the last character of the value <code>\"12345\"</code>, yielding <code>\"12347\"</code>. For another example, word 3 of <code>\"life is cruel\"</code> (cruel) can be appended after the first word of <code>\"Hello world\"</code>, yielding <code>\"Hello cruel world\"</code>. It would then be possible to put <code>\"Goodbye\"</code> into  the first word of that string, replacing the current value of that word to yield<code> \"Goodbye cruel world\"</code>. The above mentioned terms: <code>character</code>, <code>word</code>, <code>first</code>, <code>last</code>, <code>after</code>, and <code>into</code>, among many others, offer English-like control over the ability to crunch numbers and parse text, down to the character level.\n\nHyperTalk supports most standard programming structures such as \"if-then\" and \"repeat\".  The \"if-then\" structure is so flexible that it even allows \"case\" structured code.\n\nHyperTalk scripting allows the system to be easily modified and extended.  Unlike many procedural languages, and even many scripting languages, HyperTalk proved to be far more accessible to a wide range of users, partly because scripts were more or less readable as [[English language|English]]. For instance, {{code|2=applescript|put the first word of the third line of field \"hello\" into field \"goodbye\"}} did exactly that. Referring to objects and the items on cards or backgrounds is easy. The example above shows how to access data within a field on a given card, but one can refer to any object in the same fashion, including the stack. All objects can be named or renamed, as in the example above. Also, each object (including the stack) has a unique numeric identifier (ID) that never alters during the object's life.\n\nAdding scripts is also easy.  The user simply <tt>command-option-clicked</tt> (or could click the ''Script'' button in the item's property dialog) on any element in the stack, and an editor would pop up. The script may then be edited, saved, and used immediately. Also, HyperCard contains a ''Message Box'', an interactive command-line in a floating window that can execute single lines of script. This also includes the ''find'' command, so it doubles as a search dialog. HyperCard 2.0 added a [[debugger]], also.\n\nHyperTalk was sufficiently popular that one of its main uses was not as a database, but as a programming tool that empowered ordinary computer users. Thousands of ''stacks'' were written and distributed as ''stackware'' in the years when HyperCard was widely available. As stated above, programming \"for the rest of us\", that is, for non-professionals, allowed many thousands of personal applications to be created by individuals with a need for personal software solutions. Some are still in use today.\n\nMany hardware and software vendors provided their tutorials as HyperCard stacks, since the application was bundled with all Macs.\n\n===Externals===\nThe power of HyperCard could be increased significantly through the use of ''external command'' and ''external function'' modules, more commonly termed ''XCMD''s and ''XFCN''s. These were code libraries packaged in a [[resource fork]] that integrated into either the system generally or the HyperTalk language specifically; this was an early example of the [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] concept. Unlike conventional plug-ins, these did not require separate installation before they were available for use; they could be included in a stack, where they were directly available to scripts in that stack.\n\nDuring HyperCard's peak popularity in the late 1980s, a whole ecosystem of vendors offered thousands of these externals for everything from HyperTalk compilers to graphing systems, database access, internet connectivity, and animation. Oracle offered an XCMD that allowed HyperCard to directly query Oracle databases on any platform. This was later superseded by Oracle's [[Oracle Card]] product. BeeHive Technologies offered a hardware interface that allowed the computer to control external devices. Connected via the [[Apple Desktop Bus]] (ADB), this instrument could ''read'' the state of connected external switches or ''write'' digital outputs to a multitude of devices.\n\nExternals allow access to the Macintosh Toolbox, which contained many lower level commands and functions not native to HyperTalk, such as control of the serial and ADB ports.\n\n==History==\nHyperCard was created by [[Bill Atkinson]] following an [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] trip.<ref name=\"Tri2\">{{Triangulation|247|[[Bill Atkinson]]}} ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INdByDjhClU?t=1364 link])</ref> Work for it began in March 1985 under the name of WildCard (hence its [[creator code]] of 'WILD'). In 1986, Dan Winkler began work on [[HyperTalk]] and the name was changed to HyperCard for [[trademark]] reasons. It was initially released in August 1987, with the understanding that Atkinson would give HyperCard to Apple only if the company promised to release it for free on all Macs. Apple timed its release to coincide with the [[MacWorld Conference & Expo]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] to guarantee maximum publicity.\n\nHyperCard was a huge hit almost instantly. Many people who thought they would never be able to program a computer started using HyperCard for many automation and prototyping tasks, a surprise even to its creator.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Apple never seemed to understand what HyperCard's target market for users should be. Project managers found it was being used by a huge number of people, internally and externally. Bug reports and upgrade suggestions continued to flow in, demonstrating it had a wide variety of users. Since it was also free, it was difficult to justify dedicating engineering resources to improvements in the software.  It was not lost on Apple or its mainstream developers that the power HyperCard gave to people could cut into the sales of ordinary shrink-wrapped products.<ref>{{cite web |first= Douglas |last= Adams |origyear= 1989 |newspaper= [[MacWorld]] |title= Frank the Vandal |year= 2002 |publisher= Pan MacMillan |url= http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/980707-00-a.html}}</ref> [[Stewart Alsop II]] speculated that HyperCard might replace [[Finder (software)|Finder]] as the Macintosh graphical user interface.<ref name=\"alsop19880118\">{{Cite journal |last=Alsop |first=Stewart II |date=1988-01-18 |title=Apple's Finder: Maturity in UI |url=http://vintagecomputer.net/cisc367/PC-Letter_19880118.pdf |journal=P.C. Letter |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\n===HyperCard 2.0===\nIn late 1989, Kevin Calhoun, then a HyperCard engineer at Apple, led an effort to upgrade the program. This resulted in ''HyperCard 2.0'', released in 1990. The new version included an on-the-fly [[compiler]] that greatly increased performance of computationally intensive code, a new [[debugger]] and many improvements to the underlying HyperTalk language.\n\nAt the same time HyperCard 2.0 was being developed, a separate group within Apple developed and in 1991 released ''HyperCard IIGS'', a version of HyperCard for the [[Apple IIGS]] system. Aimed mainly at the education market, HyperCard IIGS had roughly the same feature set as the 1.x versions of Macintosh HyperCard, while adding support for the color graphics abilities of the IIGS. Although ''stacks'' (HyperCard program documents) were not binary-compatible, a translator program (another HyperCard stack) allowed stacks to be moved from one platform to the other.\n\nThen, Apple decided that most of its application software packages, including HyperCard, would be the property of a wholly owned subsidiary called [[Claris]]. Many of the HyperCard developers chose to stay at Apple rather than move to Claris, causing the development team to be split. Claris, in the business of selling software for a profit, attempted to create a business model where HyperCard could also generate revenues. At first the freely-distributed versions of HyperCard shipped with authoring disabled. Early versions of Claris HyperCard contained an [[Easter Egg]]: typing 'magic' into the message box would convert the player into a full HyperCard authoring environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.10/10.03/Hypercard2.2/index.html|title=Apple's taken HyperCard back from Claris. Here's what they've done with it|quote=Claris also tried an interim scheme of shipping a crippled, low user-level, Home stack, which users could override by typing 'magic' in the message box. There was some confusion between this version and the Player, that had people trying unsuccessfully to type 'magic' in the message box of the Player. The magic in HyperCard 2.2 is all plain and visible.}}</ref> When this trick became nearly-universal they wrote a new ''viewer only'' version, the ''HyperCard Player'' which Apple distributed with the Macintosh [[operating system]], while Claris sold the ''full'' version commercially. Many users were upset that they had to pay to use software that had traditionally been supplied free and which many considered a basic part of the Mac.\n\nDespite the new revenue stream, Claris did little to market HyperCard. Development continued with minor upgrades, and the first failed attempt to create a third generation of HyperCard. During this period, HyperCard began losing market share. Without several important, basic features, HyperCard authors began moving to systems such as [[SuperCard]] and [[Macromedia Authorware]]. Nonetheless, HyperCard continued to be popular and used for a widening range of applications, from the game ''[[The Manhole]]'', an earlier effort by the creators of ''[[Myst]]'', to corporate information services, and many thousands in between.\n\nApple eventually folded Claris back into the parent company, returning HyperCard to Apple's core engineering group. In 1992, Apple released the eagerly anticipated upgrade of HyperCard 2.2 and made many HyperCard enthusiasts happy by including licensed versions of Color Tools and Addmotion II, adding support for color pictures and animations. However, these tools were limited and often cumbersome to use because HyperCard still lacked true, internal color support.\n\n===HyperCard 3.0===\nSeveral attempts were made to restart HyperCard development once it returned to Apple. Because of the product's widespread use as a multimedia-authoring tool it was rolled into the [[QuickTime]] group. A new effort to allow HyperCard to create ''QuickTime interactive'' (QTi) movies started, once again under the direction of Kevin Calhoun. QTi extended QuickTime's core multimedia playback features to provide true interactive facilities and a low-level programming language based on [[68000 assembly language]].  The resulting ''HyperCard 3.0'' was first presented in 1996 when an alpha-quality version was shown to developers at Apple's annual [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC).<ref>{{cite journal |first =Clifford |last= Colby |date=September 1996 |url= http://folkstream.com/muse/teachhc/hc3.html |title= HyperCard's new deal: QuickTime authoring |journal= MacWeek}}</ref> Under the leadership of [[Dan Crow (computer scientist)|Dan Crow]] development continued through the late 1990s, with public demos showing many popular features such as color support, internet connectivity, and the ability to play HyperCard stacks (which were now special QuickTime movies) in a [[web browser]]. Development of HyperCard 3.0 stalled when the QuickTime team was focused away from developing QuickTime interactive to the streaming features of QuickTime 4.0.<ref>{{Cite journal |last= Duncan |first= Geoff |title= Alas, HyperCard! |journal= TidBits |date= November 2, 1998 |url= http://db.tidbits.com/article/5155}}</ref> [[Steve Jobs]] disliked the software because Atkinson had chosen to stay at Apple to finish it instead of joining Jobs at [[NeXT]], and (according to Atkinson) \"it had [[John Sculley|Sculley]]'s stink all over it\".{{r|Tri2}} In 2000, the HyperCard engineering team was reassigned to other tasks after Jobs decided to abandon the product. Calhoun and Crow both left Apple shortly after, in 2001.\n\nIn the years that followed, the program saw no more support from Apple, which finally ceased selling HyperCard in March 2004.<ref>{{Citation |first= Tim |last= Oren |date= March 26, 2004 |url= http://due-diligence.typepad.com/ |contribution-url= http://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2004/03/a_eulogy_for_hy.html |title= Due diligence |publisher= Type pad |contribution= A Eulogy for HyperCard |type= blog}}</ref>\n\nHyperCard runs natively only in the [[classic Mac OS]], but it can still be used in [[macOS|Mac OS X]]'s [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]] mode on PowerPC based machines (G5 and earlier). The last functional native HyperCard authoring environment is Classic mode in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) on PowerPC-based machines (although it can be run on modern Intel-based machines, including non-Apple hardware, by using an emulation layer such as [[SheepShaver]]).\n\n==Applications==\nHyperCard has been used for a range of hypertext and artistic purposes. Before the advent of [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]], HyperCard was often used as a general-purpose presentation program. Examples of HyperCard applications include simple databases, \"[[Choose Your Own Adventure|choose your own adventure]]\"\u2013type games, and educational teaching aids.\n\nDue to its rapid application design facilities, HyperCard was also often used for prototyping applications and sometimes even for version 1.0 implementations. Inside Apple, the QuickTime team was one of HyperCard's biggest customers.\n\nHyperCard has lower hardware requirements than [[Macromedia Director]]. Several commercial software products were created in HyperCard, most notably the original version of the interactive game narrative ''[[Myst]]'',<ref name=\"breen199312\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=113 |title=A Spectacle Not To Be Myst |work=Computer Gaming World |date=December 1993 |access-date=29 March 2016 |author=Breen, Christopher |pages=114, 116}}</ref> the [[Voyager Company]]'s [[Expanded Books]], and multimedia CD-ROMs of [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony CD-ROM]], [[the Beatles]]' ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', and the Voyager ''[[MacBeth]]''.

Changing their name to Mediagenic, they published several major HyperCard based applications, most notably [[Danny Goodman]]'s Focal Point,<ref name=mania /> a personal information manager, and Reports For HyperCard, a program by Nine To Five Software that allowed users to treat HyperCard as a full database system with robust information viewing and printing features.\n\nThe HyperCard-inspired [[SuperCard]] for a while included the ''Roadster'' plug-in that allowed stacks to be placed inside [[World Wide Web|Web]] pages and viewed by [[web browser]]s with an appropriate browser plug-in. There was even a Windows version of this plug-in allowing computers other than Macintoshes to use the plug-in.\n\n==Exploits==\nThe first HyperCard virus was discovered in Belgium and the Netherlands in April 1991.<ref>{{cite news|work= MacWEEK|title= Latest Mac viral infection hits the stacks: HyperCard affliction turns up in Europe (includes related article on forms virus attacks take)|date= April 16, 1991}}</ref>\n\nBecause HyperCard executed scripts in stacks immediately on opening, it was also one of the first applications susceptible to [[Macro virus (computing)|macro viruses]].

LiveCode directly imports extant HyperCard stacks and provides a migration path for stacks still in use.\n* [[SuperCard]], the first HyperCard clone, is similar to HyperCard, but with many added features such as: full color support, pixel and vector graphics, a full GUI toolkit, and support for many modern Mac OS X features. It can create both standalone applications and projects that run on the freeware SuperCard Player. SuperCard can also convert extant HyperCard stacks into SuperCard projects. It runs only on Macs.\n\nPast products included:\n* Hyper DA by Symmetry was a Desk Accessory for classic single-tasked Mac OS that allowed viewing HyperCard 1.x stacks as added windows in any extant application, and was also embedded into many Claris products (like MacDraw II) to display their user documentation.\n* HyperPad from Brightbill-Roberts was a clone of HyperCard, written for [[DOS]]. It made use of ASCII linedrawing to create the graphics of cards and buttons.\n* Plus, later renamed [[WinPlus]], was a product similar to HyperCard, for Windows and Macintosh.\n* [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] purchased Plus and created a cross-platform version as Oracle Card, later renamed [[Oracle Media Objects]], used as a [[4GL]] for database access.\n* Asymetrix's Windows application [[ToolBook]] resembled HyperCard, and later included an external converter to read HyperCard stacks (the first was a third-party product from Heizer software).\n* [[TileStack]] was an attempt to create a web based version of HyperCard that is compatible with the original HyperCard files.<ref>{{Citation |title= HyperCard comes back from the dead to the web |newspaper= Slashdot |url= http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/08/06/07/196242.shtml |date= June 7, 2008}}</ref> The site closed down January 24, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title= Farewell to Tilestack |url= http://tilestack.com/}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|number=29725702500651008|user=tilestack|title=Farewell. http://tilestack.com|date=January 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, many of the basic concepts of the original system were later re-used in other forms. Apple built their system-wide scripting engine [[AppleScript]] on a language similar to HyperTalk; it is often used for [[desktop publishing]] (DTP) [[workflow automation]] needs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} In the 1990s [[FaceSpan]] provided a third-party graphical interface, and continues to do so today. AppleScript also has a native graphical programming front-end called Automator, released with [[Mac OS X Tiger]] in April 2005. One of HyperCard's strengths was its handling of [[multimedia]], and many multimedia systems like [[Macromedia Authorware]] and [[Macromedia Director]] are based on concepts originating in HyperCard.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keating|first1=Anne B|last2=Hargitai|first2=Joseph R|title=The Wired Professor: A Guide to Incorporating the World Wide Web in College Instruction|date=1999|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0814747254|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRIVCgAAQBAJ|access-date=23 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[AppWare]], originally named Serius Developer, is sometimes seen to be similar to HyperCard, as both were [[rapid application development]] (RAD) systems.

[[Koelliker]]'s laboratory developed [[haematoxylin]] [[staining]], and in 1870s, Vysockij introduced [[eosin]] as a double or counter staining.<ref name=bock/>\n\nThe 1906 [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to histologists [[Camillo Golgi]] and [[Santiago Ramon y Cajal]]. They had conflicting interpretations of the neural structure of the brain based on differing interpretations of the same images. Cajal won the prize for his correct theory, and Golgi for the [[silver staining]] [[Golgi's method |technique]] he invented to make it possible.\n\n==Types of tissues==\nThere are four basic types of animal tissues: [[muscle tissue]], [[nervous tissue]], [[connective tissue]], and [[epithelial tissue]]. All tissue types are subtypes of these four basic tissue types (for example, blood is classified as connective tissue, since the blood cells are suspended in an extracellular matrix, the plasma).\n\n*[[Epithelium]]: the lining of glands, bowel, skin, and some organs like the liver, lung, and kidney\n*[[Endothelium]]: the lining of blood and lymphatic vessels\n*[[Mesothelium]]: the lining of pleural and pericardial spaces\n*[[Mesenchyme]]: the cells filling the spaces between the organs, including fat, muscle, bone, cartilage, and tendon cells\n*[[Blood cell]]s: the red and white blood cells, including those found in lymph nodes and spleen\n*[[Neurons]]: any of the conducting cells of the nervous system\n*[[Germ cell]]s: reproductive cells ([[spermatozoa]] in men, [[oocyte]]s in women)\n*[[Placenta]]: an organ characteristic of true mammals during pregnancy, joining mother and offspring, providing endocrine secretion and selective exchange of soluble, but not particulate, blood-borne substances through an apposition of uterine and trophoblastic vascularised parts\n*[[Stem cell]]s: cells with the ability to develop into different cell types\n\nThe tissues from plants, fungi, and microorganisms can also be examined histologically. Their structure is very different from animal tissues. For plants, the study of their tissues is more commonly called as [[plant anatomy]], with the following main types:\n* [[Epidermis (botany)|Dermal tissue]]\n* [[Vascular tissue]]\n* [[Ground tissue]]\n* [[Meristematic tissue]]\n\n==Sample preparation==\n[[File:Medical Students.jpg|thumb|Medical students (EMIS) getting samples from a human stomach for future histological studies in 2012 at Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia in Mexico]]\n\n===Fixing ===\n\n====Chemical fixation with formaldehyde or other chemicals ====\n{{main|Fixation (histology)}}\nChemical fixatives are used to preserve tissue from degradation, and to maintain the structure of the cell and of sub-cellular components such as cell organelles (e.g., nucleus, [[endoplasmic reticulum]], mitochondria). The most common fixative for light microscopy is 10% neutral buffered formalin (4% [[formaldehyde]] in [[phosphate buffered saline]]). For electron microscopy, the most commonly used fixative is [[glutaraldehyde]], usually as a 2.5% solution in [[phosphate buffered saline]]. These fixatives preserve tissues or cells mainly by irreversibly cross-linking proteins. The main action of these aldehyde fixatives is to cross-link amino groups in proteins through the formation of [[methylene bridge]]s (-CH<sub>2</sub>-), in the case of formaldehyde, or by C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub> cross-links in the case of glutaraldehyde. This process, while preserving the structural integrity of the cells and tissue can damage the biological functionality of proteins, particularly [[enzymes]], and can also [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] them to a certain extent. This can be detrimental to certain histological techniques. Further fixatives are often used for electron microscopy such as [[osmium tetroxide]] or [[uranyl acetate]].\n\nFormalin fixation leads to degradation of mRNA, miRNA, and DNA as well as denaturation and modification of proteins in tissues. However, extraction and analysis of nucleic acids and proteins from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues is possible using appropriate protocols.<ref name=Klopfleisch>{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss AT, Delcour NM, Meyer A, Klopfleisch R | title = Efficient and cost-effective extraction of genomic DNA from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues | journal = Veterinary Pathology | volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 834\u20138 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 20817894 | doi = 10.1177/0300985810380399 }}</ref><ref name=pmid29900094>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bennike TB, Kastaniegaard K, Padurariu S, Gaihede M, Birkelund S, Andersen V, Stensballe A | title = \u2fffComparing the proteome of snap frozen, RNAlater preserved, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tissue samples | journal = EuPA Open Proteomics | volume = 10 | pages = 9\u201318 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 29900094 | pmc = 5988570 | doi = 10.1016/j.euprot.2015.10.001 }}</ref>\n\n====Frozen section fixation====\n\n[[Frozen section procedure]] is a rapid way to fix and mount histology sections using a refrigeration device called a [[cryostat]]. It is often used after surgical removal of [[tumor]]s to allow rapid determination of margin (that the tumor has been completely removed).\n\n=== Processing - dehydration, clearing, and infiltration===\n\nThe aim of tissue processing is to remove water from tissues and replace with a medium that solidifies to allow thin sections to be cut. Biological tissue must be supported in a hard matrix to allow sufficiently thin sections to be cut, typically 5 \u03bcm (micrometres; 1000 micrometres = 1&nbsp;mm) thick for light microscopy and 80-100&nbsp;nm (nanometre; 1,000,000 nanometres = 1&nbsp;mm) thick for electron microscopy. For light microscopy, paraffin wax is most frequently used. Since it is immiscible with water, the main constituent of biological tissue, water must first be removed in the process of dehydration. Samples are transferred through baths of progressively more concentrated [[ethanol]] to remove the water. This is followed by a hydrophobic clearing agent (such as [[xylene]]) to remove the alcohol, and finally molten [[paraffin wax]], the infiltration agent, which replaces the xylene. \nParaffin wax does not provide a sufficiently hard matrix for cutting very thin sections for electron microscopy. Instead, resins are used. Epoxy resins are the most commonly employed embedding media, but acrylic resins are also used, particularly where [[immunohistochemistry]] is required. Thicker sections (0.35\u03bcm to 5\u03bcm) of resin-embedded tissue can also be cut for light microscopy. Again, the immiscibility of most epoxy and acrylic resins with water necessitates the use of dehydration, usually with ethanol.\n\n===Embedding===\n[[File:OCT embedding (Optimal Cutting Temperature compound).png|thumbnail|OCT embedding<ref>{{cite web | url = http://store.histalim.com/product/trimming-inclusion-dun-bloc-en-oct/?lang=en | title = OCT embedding | publisher = Histalim }}</ref> (optimal cutting temperature compound)]]\nAfter the tissues have been dehydrated, cleared, and infiltrated with the embedding material, they are ready for external embedding. During this process the tissue samples are placed into molds along with liquid embedding material (such as agar, gelatine, or wax) which is then hardened. This is achieved by cooling in the case of paraffin wax and heating (curing) in the case of the epoxy resins. The acrylic resins are polymerised by heat, ultraviolet light, or chemical catalysts. The hardened blocks containing the tissue samples are then ready to be sectioned.\n\nBecause formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues may be stored indefinitely at room temperature, and nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) may be recovered from them decades after fixation, FFPE tissues are an important resource for historical studies in medicine.\n\nEmbedding can also be accomplished using frozen, non-fixed tissue in a water-based medium.  Pre-frozen tissues are placed into molds with the liquid embedding material, usually a water-based glycol, OCT, TBS, Cryogel, or resin, which is then frozen to form hardened blocks.\n\n===Sectioning===\n{{Main|Microtome}}\n\nFor light microscopy, a steel knife mounted in a microtome is used to cut 4-[[micrometre|micrometer]]-thick tissue sections which are mounted on a glass [[microscope slide]]. For transmission electron microscopy, a diamond knife mounted in an [[ultramicrotome]] is used to cut 50-[[nanometre|nanometer]]-thick tissue sections which are mounted on a 3-millimeter-diameter copper grid. Then the mounted sections are treated with the appropriate [[staining (biology)|stain]].\n\nSections can be cut through the tissue in a number of directions. For pathological evaluation of tissues, vertical sectioning,  (cut perpendicular to the surface of the tissue to produce a cross section) is the usual method.  Horizontal (also known as transverse or longitudinal) sectioning, cut along the long axis of the tissue, is often used in the evaluation of the hair follicles and pilosebaceous units.  Tangential to horizontal sectioning is used in [[Mohs surgery]] and in methods of [[CCPDMA]].\n\n====Cryosectioning====\n{{Main|Frozen section procedure}}\nFixed or unfixed tissue may be frozen and sliced using a microtome mounted in a refrigeration device known as a cryostat. The frozen sections are mounted on a glass slide and may be stained to enhance the contrast between different tissues. Unfixed frozen sections can also be used for studies requiring enzyme localization in tissues and cells. It is necessary to fix tissue for certain procedures such as antibody linked [[immunofluorescence]] staining. Frozen sectioning can also be used to determine if a tumour is malignant when it is found incidentally during surgery on a patient.\n[[File:Histological sample of Trachea obtained at \"Instituto Nacional de Cardiolog\u00eda Ignacio A. Ch\u00e1vez\".JPG|thumb|Sample of a trachea coloured with hematoxylin and eosin]]\n\n===Staining===\n{{Main|Staining}}\n[[Image:Pseudorhabdosynochus morrhua.jpg|thumb|Example of staining<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.histalim.com/accueil/activities/our-services/histology/ | title = Example of staining | work = Histalim }}</ref> in light microscopy: [[carmine]] staining of a [[monogenea]]n (parasitic worm)]]\n\nBiological tissue has little inherent contrast in either the light or electron microscope. [[Staining]] is employed  to give both contrast to the tissue as well as highlighting particular features of interest. Where the underlying mechanistic chemistry of staining is understood, the term [[histochemistry]] is used. [[Hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] ([[H&E stain]]) is the most commonly used light microscopical stain in histology and histopathology. Hematoxylin, a [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] dye, stains [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] blue due to an affinity to nucleic acids in the cell nucleus; eosin, an [[Acid (chemistry)|acidic]] dye, stains the [[cytoplasm]] pink. [[Uranyl acetate]] and lead citrate are commonly used to impart contrast to tissue in the electron microscope.\n\nThere are many other staining techniques that have been used to selectively stain cells and cellular components. One of these techniques  involves marking peripheral tumors or surgical margins, in which a certain color of dye is applied to the posterior border of a sample, another to the anterior, etc., so that one can identify the location of a tumor or other pathology within a specimen. Other compounds used to color tissue sections include [[safranin]], [[Oil Red O]], [[Congo red]], [[Fast green FCF]], silver salts, and numerous natural and artificial [[dye]]s that usually originated from the development of dyes for the textile industry.\n\n[[Histochemistry]] refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. A commonly performed histochemical technique is the Perls [[Prussian blue]] reaction, used to demonstrate iron deposits in diseases like [[hemochromatosis]].\n\nHistology samples have often been examined by radioactive techniques.  In [[historadiography]], a slide (sometimes stained histochemically) is X-rayed.  More commonly, [[autoradiography]] is used to visualize the locations to which a radioactive substance has been transported within the body, such as cells in [[S phase]] (undergoing [[DNA replication]]) which incorporate tritiated [[thymidine]], or sites to which radiolabeled [[nucleic acid]] probes bind in [[in situ hybridization]].  For autoradiography on a microscopic level, the slide is typically dipped into liquid nuclear tract emulsion, which dries to form the exposure film.  Individual silver grains in the film are visualized with [[dark field microscopy]].\n\nRecently, [[antibodies]] have been used to specifically visualize proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. This process is called [[immunohistochemistry]], or when the stain is a [[fluorescent]] molecule, [[immunofluorescence]]. This technique has greatly increased the ability to identify categories of cells under a microscope. Other advanced techniques, such as nonradioactive ''in situ'' hybridization, can be combined with immunochemistry  to identify specific DNA or RNA molecules with fluorescent probes or tags that can be used for immunofluorescence and  enzyme-linked fluorescence amplification (especially [[alkaline phosphatase]] and tyramide signal amplification).  [[Fluorescence microscopy]] and [[confocal microscopy]] are used to detect fluorescent signals with good intracellular detail.  [[Digital camera]]s are increasingly used to capture histological and histopathological image\n\n== Common laboratory stains ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Stain\n! Common use\n! Nucleus\n!

Tissues are embedded in [[epoxy]] resin. Very thin sections (less than  0.1 micrometer) are cut using diamond or glass knives.  The sections are stained with electron dense stains (uranium and lead) so that they can be seen with the [[electron microscope]].\n\n==Artifacts==\nArtifacts are structures or features in tissue that interfere with normal histological examination. These are not always present in normal tissue and can come from outside sources. Artifacts interfere with histology by changing the tissues appearance and hiding structures. These can be divided into two categories:\n\n===Pre-histology===\nThese are features and structures that have been introduced prior to the collection of the tissues. A common example of these include: ink from tattoos and freckles (melanin) in skin samples.\n\n===Post-histology===\nArtifacts can result from tissue processing. Processing commonly leads to changes like shrinkage, washing out of particular cellular components, color changes in different tissues types and alterations of the structures in the tissue. Because these are caused in a laboratory the majority of post histology artifacts can be avoided or removed after being discovered. A common example is mercury pigment left behind after using [[Zenker's fixative]] to fix a section.\n\n===Histology art===\nNormal patterning of tissues and artifacts resulting from the tissue preparation process ensure that each histological section is unique. Like a piece of biological art these images provide a deep insight into the organization and function of our bodies.

He is known for having written the book ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', a detailed record of his \"inquiry\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}} [[History#Etymology|''histor\u00eda'']]) on the origins of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. He is widely considered to have been the first writer to have treated historical subjects using a method of systematic investigation\u2014specifically, by collecting his materials and then critically arranging them into a [[historiographic]] narrative. On account of this, he is often referred to as \"[[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field#Social sciences|The Father of History]]\", a title first conferred on him by the first-century BC Roman orator [[Cicero]].<ref>T. James Luce, ''The Greek Historians'', 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o7aHAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA26 p. 26].</ref>\n\nDespite Herodotus's historical significance, little is known about his personal life. His ''Histories'' primarily deals with the lives of [[Croesus]], [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], [[Cambyses II|Cambyses]], [[Bardiya|Smerdis]], [[Darius I|Darius]], and [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] and the battles of [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]]; however, his many cultural, [[Ethnography|ethnographical]], geographical, [[Historiography|historiographical]], and other digressions form a defining and essential part of the ''Histories'' and contain a wealth of information. Herodotus has been criticized for the fact that his book includes a large number of obvious legends and fanciful accounts. Many authors, starting with the late fifth-century BC historian [[Thucydides]], have accused him of making up stories for entertainment. Herodotus, however, states that he is merely reporting what he has been told. A sizable portion of the information he provides has since been confirmed by historians and archaeologists.\n\n==Place in history==\nHerodotus announced the purpose and scope of his work at the beginning of his ''Histories''{{efn|For the past several hundred years, the title of Herodotus's work has been translated rather roughly as ''The Histories'' or ''The History''.

Herodotus's place in history and his significance may be understood according to the traditions within which he worked. His work is the earliest Greek prose to have survived intact. However, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a literary critic of [[Principate|Augustan Rome]], listed seven predecessors of Herodotus, describing their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, Greek or foreign, including popular legends, sometimes melodramatic and na\u00efve, often charming \u2013 all traits that can be found in the work of Herodotus himself.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=23}}, citing Dionysius ''On Thucydides''</ref>\n\nModern historians regard the chronology as uncertain, but according to the ancient account, these predecessors included [[Dionysius of Miletus]], [[Charon of Lampsacus]], [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], [[Xanthus of Lydia]] and, the best attested of them all, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. Of these, only fragments of Hecataeus's works survived, and the authenticity of these is debatable,<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=27}}</ref> but they provide a glimpse into the kind of tradition within which Herodotus wrote his own ''Histories''.\n\n===Writing style===\nIn his introduction to Hecataeus's work, ''Genealogies'':\n[[File:POxy v0017 n2099 a 01 hires.jpg|thumb|upright=0.86|Fragment from the ''Histories''&nbsp;VIII on [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus]] 2099, early 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD]]\n{{quotation|Hecataeus the Milesian speaks thus: I write these things as they seem true to me; for the stories told by the Greeks are various and in my opinion absurd.}}\n\nThis points forward to the \"folksy\" yet \"international\" outlook typical of Herodotus. However, one modern scholar has described the work of Hecataeus as \"a curious false start to history\",<ref name=\"OswynMurray\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=188}}</ref> since despite his critical spirit, he failed to liberate history from myth. Herodotus mentions Hecataeus in his ''Histories'', on one occasion mocking him for his naive genealogy and, on another occasion, quoting Athenian complaints against his handling of their national history.<ref>{{Herodotus|en|2|143|ref}}, {{Herodotus|en|6|137}}</ref> It is possible that Herodotus borrowed much material from Hecataeus, as stated by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in a quote recorded by [[Eusebius]].<ref>''Preparation of the Gospel'',&nbsp;X, 3</ref> In particular, it is possible that he copied descriptions of the [[crocodile]], [[hippopotamus]], and [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] from Hecataeus's ''Circumnavigation of the Known World'' (''Periegesis'' / ''Periodos ges''), even misrepresenting the source as \"Heliopolitans\" (''Histories''&nbsp;2.73).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=430, 440}}</ref>\n\nBut Hecataeus did not record events that had occurred in living memory, unlike Herodotus, nor did he include the oral traditions of Greek history within the larger framework of oriental history.<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=431}}</ref> There is no proof that Herodotus derived the ambitious scope of his own work, with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict, from any predecessor, despite much scholarly speculation about this in modern times.<ref name=\"OswynMurray\" /><ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|pp=22\u201323}}</ref> Herodotus claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism. For example, he argues for continental asymmetry as opposed to the older theory of a perfectly circular earth with Europe and Asia/Africa equal in size (''Histories''&nbsp;4.36 and 4.42). However, he retains idealizing tendencies, as in his symmetrical notions of the [[Danube]] and [[Nile]].<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=430}}</ref>\n\nHis debt to previous authors of prose \"histories\" might be questionable, but there is no doubt that Herodotus owed much to the example and inspiration of poets and story-tellers. For example, Athenian tragic poets provided him with a world-view of a balance between conflicting forces, upset by the [[hubris]] of kings, and they provided his narrative with a model of episodic structure. His familiarity with Athenian tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Persae]]'', including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the Persian navy at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] caused the defeat of the land army (''Histories''&nbsp;8.68 ~ ''Persae''&nbsp;728). The debt may have been repaid by Sophocles because there appear to be echoes of ''The Histories'' in his plays, especially a passage in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles play)|Antigone]]'' that resembles Herodotus's account of the death of Intaphernes (''Histories''&nbsp;3.119 ~ ''Antigone''&nbsp;904-920).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=427, 432}}</ref> However, this point is one of the most contentious issues in modern scholarship.<ref>Richard Jebb (ed), ''Antigone'', Cambridge University Press, 1976, pp&nbsp;181-182, n.904-920</ref>\n\n[[Homer]] was another inspirational source.{{efn|\u201cIn the scheme and plan of his work, in the arrangement and order of its parts, in the tone and character of the thoughts, in ten thousand little expressions and words, the Homeric student appears.\u201d<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=6}}</ref>}} Just as Homer drew extensively on a tradition of oral poetry, sung by wandering minstrels, so Herodotus appears to have drawn on an Ionian tradition of story-telling, collecting and interpreting the oral histories he chanced upon in his travels. These oral histories often contained folk-tale motifs and demonstrated a moral, yet they also contained substantial facts relating to geography, anthropology, and history, all compiled by Herodotus in an entertaining style and format.<ref>{{harvp|Murray|1986|pp=190\u2013191}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary and modern critics===\nIt is on account of the many strange stories and the folk-tales he reported that his critics in early modern times branded him \"The Father of Lies\".<ref name=\"BurnHerodotus\">{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=16 November 2009|author=David Pipes}}</ref> Even his own contemporaries found reason to scoff at his achievement. In fact, one modern scholar<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859}}</ref> has wondered if Herodotus left his home in Greek [[Anatolia]], migrating westwards to Athens and beyond, because his own countrymen had ridiculed his work, a circumstance possibly hinted at in an epitaph said to have been dedicated to Herodotus at one of his three supposed resting places, [[Thuria, Messenia|Thuria]]:\n{{quotation|Herodotus the son of Sphynx <br>\nlies; in Ionic history without peer; <br>\na Dorian born, who fled from slander's brand <br>\nand made in Thuria his new native land.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=13}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nYet it was in Athens where his most formidable contemporary critics could be found. In 425&nbsp;BC, which is about the time that Herodotus is thought by many scholars to have died, the Athenian comic dramatist [[Aristophanes]] created ''[[The Acharnians]]'', in which he blames the [[Peloponnesian War]] on the abduction of some prostitutes \u2013 a mocking reference to Herodotus, who reported the Persians' account of their [[The Persian Wars|wars with Greece]], beginning with the rapes of the mythical heroines [[Io (mythology)|Io]], [[Europa (Greek mythology)|Europa]], [[Medea]], and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].<ref>Lawrence A.

There is no reason to disbelieve the ''Suda''<nowiki/>'s information about his family: that it was influential and that he was the son of Lyxes and Dryo, and the brother of Theodorus, and that he was also related to [[Panyassis]] &ndash; an epic poet of the time. The town was within the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] at that time, making Herodotus a Persian subject,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dandamaev|first1=M.

Inscriptions recently discovered at Halicarnassus indicate that her grandson Lygdamis negotiated with a local assembly to settle disputes over seized property, which is consistent with a tyrant under pressure. His name is not mentioned later in the tribute list of the Athenian [[Delian League]], indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him some time before 454&nbsp;BC. The epic poet [[Panyassis]] &ndash; a relative of Herodotus &ndash; is reported to have taken part in a failed uprising. Herodotus expresses affection for the island of [[Samos]] (III,&nbsp;39\u201360), and this is an indication that he might have lived there in his youth. So it is possible that his family was involved in an uprising against Lygdamis, leading to a period of exile on [[Samos]] and followed by some personal hand in the tyrant's eventual fall.\n\n[[File:herodotusstatue.JPG|thumb|upright|The statue of Herodotus in his hometown of [[Halicarnassus]], modern [[Bodrum]], Turkey]]\n\nHerodotus wrote his ''Histories'' in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] dialect, yet he was born in Halicarnassus, which was a [[Dorians|Dorian]] settlement. According to the ''Suda'', Herodotus learned the Ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of Samos, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of Lygdamis, tyrant of Halicarnassus and grandson of Artemisia. The ''Suda'' also informs us that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotus's time, we now know that the Ionic dialect was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so there is no need to assume (like the ''Suda'') that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=11}}</ref> Further, the ''Suda'' is the only source which we have for the role played by Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=11}}</ref>\n\n===Early travels===\nAs Herodotus himself reveals, Halicarnassus, though a Dorian city, had ended its close relations with its Dorian neighbours after an unseemly quarrel (I,&nbsp;144), and it had helped pioneer Greek trade with Egypt (II,&nbsp;178). It was, therefore, an outward-looking, international-minded port within the [[Persian Empire]], and the historian's family could well have had contacts in other countries under Persian rule, facilitating his travels and his researches.\n\nHerodotus's eye-witness accounts indicate that he traveled in Egypt in association with Athenians, probably some time after 454&nbsp;BC or possibly earlier, after an Athenian fleet had assisted the uprising against [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]] in 460\u2013454&nbsp;BC. He probably traveled to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] next and then down the [[Euphrates]] to [[Babylon]]. For some reason, possibly associated with local politics, he subsequently found himself unpopular in Halicarnassus, and some time around 447&nbsp;BC, migrated to [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] &ndash; a city whose people and democratic institutions he openly admires (V,&nbsp;78). Athens was also the place where he came to know the local topography (VI,&nbsp;137; VIII,&nbsp;52\u20135), as well as leading citizens such as the [[Alcmaeonids]], a clan whose history features frequently in his writing.\n\nAccording to [[Eusebius]]<ref>Eusebius ''Chron. Can. Pars.''&nbsp;II p&nbsp;339, 01.83.4, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> and [[Plutarch]],<ref>Plutarch ''De Malign. Herod.''&nbsp;II p&nbsp;862&nbsp;A, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> Herodotus was granted a financial reward by the Athenian assembly in recognition of his work. It is possible that he unsuccessfully applied for Athenian citizenship, a rare honour after 451&nbsp;BC, requiring two separate votes by a well-attended assembly.\n\n===Later life===\nIn 443&nbsp;BC or shortly afterwards, he migrated to [[Thurium]] as part of an Athenian-sponsored colony. [[Aristotle]] refers to a version of ''The Histories'' written by \"Herodotus of Thurium\", and some passages in the ''Histories'' have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about southern Italy from personal experience there (IV,&nbsp;15,99; VI,&nbsp;127). Intimate knowledge of some events in the first years of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (VI,&nbsp;91; VII,&nbsp;133, 233; IX,&nbsp;73) indicate that he might have returned to Athens, in which case it is possible that he died there during an outbreak of the plague. Possibly he died in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] instead, after obtaining the patronage of the court there; or else he died back in Thurium. There is nothing in the ''Histories'' that can be dated to later than 430&nbsp;BC with any certainty, and it is generally assumed that he died not long afterwards, possibly before his sixtieth year.\n\n===Author and orator===\nHerodotus would have made his researches known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd. John Marincola writes in his introduction to the Penguin edition of ''The Histories'' that there are certain identifiable pieces in the early books of Herodotus's work which could be labeled as \"performance pieces\". These portions of the research seem independent and \"almost detachable\", so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual matrix of the 5th&nbsp;century, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Histories|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = xii|others = Introduction and Notes by John Marincola; Trans. by Aubrey de Selincourt}}</ref>\n\nIt was conventional in Herodotus's day for authors to \"publish\" their works by reciting them at popular festivals. According to [[Lucian]], Herodotus took his finished work straight from Anatolia to the Olympic Games and read the entire ''Histories'' to the assembled spectators in one sitting, receiving rapturous applause at the end of it.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> According to a very different account by an ancient grammarian,<ref>Montfaucon\u2019s ''Bibliothec. Coisl. Cod.''&nbsp;clxxvii p&nbsp;609, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> Herodotus refused to begin reading his work at the festival of Olympia until some clouds offered him a bit of shade &ndash; by which time the assembly had dispersed. (Hence the proverbial expression \"Herodotus and his shade\" to describe someone who misses an opportunity through delay.) Herodotus's recitation at Olympia was a favourite theme among ancient writers, and there is another interesting variation on the story to be found in the ''Suda'': that of [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Photius]]<ref>Photius ''Bibliothec. Cod.''&nbsp;lx p&nbsp;59, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> and [[Tzetzes]],<ref>Tzetzes ''Chil.''&nbsp;1.19, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> in which a young Thucydides happened to be in the assembly with his father, and burst into tears during the recital. Herodotus observed prophetically to the boy's father, \"Your son's soul yearns for knowledge.\"\n\nEventually, Thucydides and Herodotus became close enough for both to be interred in Thucydides' tomb in Athens. Such at least was the opinion of Marcellinus in his ''Life of Thucydides''.<ref>Marcellinus, ''in Vita. Thucyd.'' p&nbsp;ix, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=25}}</ref> According to the ''Suda'', he was buried in Macedonian [[Pella]] and in the [[agora]] in [[Thurium]].<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=25}}</ref>\n\n==Reliability==\n[[File:Dedication page for the Historiae by Herodotus printed at Venice 1494.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dedication]] in the ''Histories'', translated into Latin by [[Lorenzo Valla]], Venice 1494]]\n''The Histories'' were occasionally criticized in antiquity,{{efn|See [[Lucian]] of Samosata, who went as far as to deny him a place among the famous on the Island of the Blessed in ''Verae Historiae''.}} but modern historians and philosophers generally take a positive view.<ref name=\"OswynMurray_b\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=189}}</ref> Despite the controversy,<ref>{{harvp|Mikalson|2003|pp=198\u2013200}}</ref>{{efn|Some regard his works as being at least partly unreliable.

For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the [[Nile]] was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be snow in Africa, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that desert winds affect the passage of the Sun over this part of the world (2:18ff). He also passes on reports from [[Phoenicia]]n sailors that, while circumnavigating [[Africa]], they \"saw the sun on the right side while sailing westwards\". Owing to this brief mention, which is included almost as an afterthought, it has been argued that Africa was circumnavigated by ancient seafarers, for this is precisely where the sun ought to have been.

The archaeological study of the now-submerged [[ancient Egypt]]ian city of [[Heracleion]] and the recovery of the so-called \"Naucratis stela\" give credibility to Herodotus's previously unsupported claim that Heracleion was founded during the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]].\n[[File:Claude Vignon - Parable of the Unforgiving Servant.jpg|thumb|left|''Croesus Receiving Tribute from a Lydian Peasant'', by [[Claude Vignon]]]]\n\nAfter journeys to India and Pakistan, French ethnologist [[Michel Peissel]] claimed to have discovered an animal species that may illuminate one of the most bizarre passages in Herodotus's ''Histories''.<ref name=\"Peissel Ants\">{{harvp|Peissel|1984}}</ref> In Book 3, passages 102 to 105, Herodotus reports that a species of fox-sized, furry \"[[ant]]s\" lives in one of the far eastern, Indian provinces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. This region, he reports, is a sandy desert, and the sand there contains a wealth of fine gold dust. These giant ants, according to Herodotus, would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust. Peissel reports that, in an isolated region of northern Pakistan on the [[Deosai National Park|Deosai Plateau]] in [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]] province, there is a species of [[marmot]] \u2013 the [[Himalayan marmot]], a type of burrowing [[squirrel]] \u2013 that may have been what Herodotus called giant ants. The ground of the Deosai Plateau is rich in gold dust, much like the province that Herodotus describes. According to Peissel, he interviewed the [[Brokpa|Minaro]] tribal people who live in the Deosai Plateau, and they have confirmed that they have, for generations, been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their underground burrows. Later authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned this story in the [[gold mining]] section of his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''. [[File:Himalayan Marmot at Tshophu Lake Bhutan 091007 a.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Himalayan marmot]]]] Peissel offers the theory that Herodotus may have confused the old Persian word for \"marmot\" with the word for \"mountain ant\". Research suggests that Herodotus probably did not know any Persian (or any other language except his native Greek) and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian Empire. Herodotus did not claim to have personally seen the creatures which he described.<ref name=\"Peissel Ants\" /><ref>{{cite news |author=Marlise Simons |date=25 November 1996 |title=Himalayas offer clue to legend of gold-digging 'ants' |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/25/world/himalayas-offer-clue-to-legend-of-gold-digging-ants.html |accessdate=23 February 2016}}</ref> Herodotus did, though, follow up in passage 105 of Book 3 with the claim that the \"ants\" are said to chase and devour full-grown camels.\n\n===Accusations of bias===\nSome \"calumnious fictions\" were written about Herodotus in a work titled ''[[On the Malice of Herodotus]]'' by [[Plutarch]], a [[Chaeronea]]n by birth, (or it might have been a [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], in this case \"a great collector of slanders\"), including the allegation that the historian was prejudiced against Thebes because the authorities there had denied him permission to set up a school.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> Similarly, in a ''Corinthian Oration'', [[Dio Chrysostom]] (or yet another pseudonymous author) accused the historian of prejudice against [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], sourcing it in personal bitterness over financial disappointments<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/37*.html |title=Dio Chrysostom '&#39;Orat. xxxvii, p11 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref> \u2013 an account also given by [[Marcellinus (writer)|Marcellinus]] in his ''Life of Thucydides''.<ref>Marcellinus, ''Life of Thucydides''</ref> In fact, Herodotus was in the habit of seeking out information from empowered sources within communities, such as aristocrats and priests, and this also occurred at an international level, with [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] becoming his principal source of information about events in Greece. As a result, his reports about Greek events are often coloured by Athenian bias against rival states \u2013 [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and Corinth in particular.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|pp=8, 9, 32\u201334}}</ref>\n\n''The Histories'' were sometimes criticized in antiquity,{{efn|For example, they were criticized for inaccuracy by [[Lucian]] of Samosata, who attacked Herodotus as a liar in ''Verae Historiae'' and went as far as to deny him a place among the famous on the [[Fortunate Isles|Island of the Blessed]]}} but modern historians and philosophers take a more positive view of Herodotus's methodology, especially those searching for a paradigm of objective historical writing. A few modern scholars have argued that Herodotus exaggerated the extent of his travels and invented his sources,<ref>{{harvp|Fehling|1989}}</ref> yet his reputation continues largely intact. Herodotus is variously considered \"father of comparative anthropology\",<ref name=\"BurnHerodotus\" /> \"the father of ethnography\",<ref name=\"Jones\"/> and \"more modern than any other ancient historian in his approach to the ideal of total history\".<ref name=\"OswynMurray_b\"/>\n\n=== Use of sources and sense of authority ===\nIt is clear from the beginning of Book 1 of the ''Histories'' that Herodotus utilizes (or at least claims to utilize) various sources in his narrative. K.H. Waters relates that \"Herodotos did not work from a purely Hellenic standpoint; he was accused by the patriotic but somewhat imperceptive Plutarch of being ''philobarbaros'', a pro-barbarian or pro-foreigner.\"<ref>{{harvp|Waters|1985|p=3}}</ref>\n\nHerodotus at times relates various accounts of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the Phoenician and the Persian accounts of Io.<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=pp. 5\u20136, \u00a71.1, 1.5}}</ref> However, Herodotus at times arbitrates between varying accounts: \"I am not going to say that these events happened one way or the other. Rather, I will point out the man ''who I know for a fact'' began the wrong-doing against the Greeks.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 6, \u00a71.5}}</ref> Again, later, Herodotus claims himself as an authority: \"I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 9, \u00a71.20}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his work, Herodotus attempts to explain the actions of people. Speaking about Solon the Athenian, Herodotus states \"[Solon] sailed away on the pretext of seeing the world, ''but it was really so that he could not be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had laid down''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 12, \u00a71.29}}</ref> Again, in the story about Croesus and his son's death, when speaking of Adrastus (the man who accidentally killed Croesus' son), Herodotus states: \"Adrastus ... ''believing himself to be the most ill-fated man he had ever known'', cut his own throat over the grave.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 17, \u00a71.45, \u00b62}}</ref>\n\nWhile Herodotus had not met these people whom he is discussing, he claims to understand their thoughts and intentions.\n\n== Mode of explanation ==\nHerodotus writes with the purpose of ''explaining''; that is, he discusses the reason for or cause of for an event. He lays this out in the proem: \"This is the publication of the research of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that the actions of people shall not fade with time, so that the great and admirable achievements of both Greeks and barbarians shall not go unrenowned, and, among other things, ''to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|p=5}}</ref>\n\nThis mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to Homer,<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=64}}</ref> who opened the ''Iliad'' by asking:\n\n:''Which of the immortals set these two at each other's throats?''\n:''Apollo,''\n:''Zeus\u2019 son and Leto\u2019s, offended''\n:''by the warlord. Agamemnon had dishonored''\n:''Chryses, Apollo's priest, so the god''\n:''struck the Greek camp with plague,''\n:''and the soldiers were dying of it.''<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'', trans. Stanley Lombardo (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company'','' 1997): 1, Bk. 1, lines 9-16.</ref>\n\nBoth Homer and Herodotus begin with a question of causality. In Homer's case, \"who set these two at each other's throats?\" In Herodotus's case, \"Why did the Greeks and barbarians go to war with each other?\"\n\nHerodotus's means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause; rather, his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions. It is notable, however, that \"the obligations of gratitude and revenge are the fundamental human motives for Herodotus, just as ... they are the primary stimulus to the generation of narrative itself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=65}}</ref>\n\nSome readers of Herodotus believe that his habit of tying events back to personal motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action. Gould argues to the contrary that this is likely because Herodotus attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing more abstract reasons.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=67}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of causality ===\nHerodotus attributes cause to both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This is true of Greek thinking in general, at least from [[Homer]] onward.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=67\u201370}}</ref> Gould notes that invoking the supernatural in order to explain an event does not answer the question \"why did this happen?\" but rather \"why did this happen to me?\" By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will is the reason that the house collapses at the particular moment when I am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=71}}</ref>\n\nSome authors, including [[Geoffrey de Ste-Croix]] and [[Mabel Lang]], have argued that Fate, or the belief that \"this is how it had to be,\" is Herodotus's ultimate understanding of causality.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=72\u201373}}</ref> Herodotus's explanation that an event \"was going to happen\" maps well on to Aristotelean and Homeric means of expression. The idea of \"it was going to happen\" reveals a \"tragic discovery\" associated with fifth-century drama. This tragic discovery can be seen in Homer's, ''[[Iliad]]'' as well.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=75\u201376}}</ref>\n\nJohn Gould argues that Herodotus should be understood as falling in a long line of story-tellers, rather than thinking of his means of explanation as a \"philosophy of history\" or \"simple causality\". Thus, according to Gould, Herodotus's means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior:<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=76\u201378}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|Herodotus' sense of what was 'going to happen' is not the language of one who holds a theory of historical necessity, who sees the whole of human experience as constrained by inevitability and without room for human choice or human responsibility, diminished and belittled by forces too large for comprehension or resistance; it is rather the traditional language of a teller of tales whose tale is structured by his awareness of the shape it must have and who presents human experience on the model of the narrative patterns that are built into his stories; the narrative impulse itself, the impulse towards 'closure' and the sense of an ending, is retrojected to become 'explanation'.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=77\u201378}}</ref>}}\n\n==Herodotus and myth==\nAlthough Herodotus considered his \"inquiries\" a serious pursuit of knowledge, he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his [[historical method]], by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their probability.<ref>{{harvp|Wardman|1960}}</ref> While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of human events, Herodotus states emphatically that \"many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man\" (IX, 100).\n\nIn Book One, passages 23 and 24, Herodotus relates the story of [[Arion]], the renowned harp player, \"second to no man living at that time,\" who was saved by a dolphin. Herodotus prefaces the story by noting that \"a very wonderful thing is said to have happened,\" and alleges its veracity by adding that the \"Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter.\" Having become very rich while at the court of Periander, Arion conceived a desire to sail to Italy and Sicily. He hired a vessel crewed by Corinthians, whom he felt he could trust, but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth. Arion discovered the plot and begged for his life, but the crew gave him two options: that either he kill himself on the spot or jump ship and fend for himself in the sea. Arion flung himself into the water, and a dolphin carried him to shore.<ref>''Histories'' 1.23\u201324.</ref>\n\nHerodotus clearly writes as both historian and teller of tales. Herodotus takes a fluid position between the artistic story-weaving of Homer and the rational data-accounting of later historians. John Herrington has developed a helpful metaphor for describing Herodotus's dynamic position in the history of Western art and thought \u2013 Herodotus as centaur:\n\n{{blockquote|The human forepart of the animal ... is the urbane and responsible classical historian; the body indissolubly united to it is something out of the faraway mountains, out of an older, freer and wilder realm where our conventions have no force.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=8}}</ref>}}\n\nHerodotus is neither a mere gatherer of data nor a simple teller of tales \u2013 he is both. While Herodotus is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what Herodotus is doing in the ''Histories'', we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as mythologist and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history. As James Romm has written, Herodotus worked under a common ancient Greek cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold (e.g. in myths or legends) produces a valid kind of understanding, even when this retelling is not entirely factual.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=6}}</ref> For Herodotus, then, it takes both myth and history to produce truthful understanding.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|\n* [[Histories (Herodotus)]]\n* [[Historiography]] (the history of history and historians)\n* [[Thucydides]], ancient Greek historian who is also often said to be \"the father of history\"\n* [[Strabo]]\n* ''[[Geographica]]''\n* [[Pliny the Elder]]\n* ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''\n* [[Padaei|The Padaei]]\n* [[Pseudo-Herodotus]]\n* [[Sostratos of Aegina]]\n* [[Battle of Thermopylae#Sources|Battle of Thermopylae: Herodotus and other Sources]]\n* [[The Herodotus Machine]]\n}}\n\n==Critical editions==\n* C.

If the individual is concerned with events preceding [[recorded history|written history]], the individual is a historian of [[prehistory]].  Some historians are recognized by publications or training and experience.<ref name=\"HermanAM\">Herman, A. M. (1998). Occupational outlook handbook: 1998-99 edition. Indianapolis: JIST Works. Page 525.</ref>  \"Historian\" became a professional occupation in the late nineteenth century as research universities were emerging in Germany and elsewhere.\n\n==Objectivity==\nDuring the ''[[Irving v Penguin Books Ltd|Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt]]'' trial, it became evident that the court needed to identify what was an \"objective historian\" in the same vein as the [[reasonable person]], and reminiscent of the standard traditionally used in English law of \"[[the man on the Clapham omnibus]]\".{{sfn|Schneider|2001|p=1531}} This was necessary so that there would be a legal bench mark to compare and contrast the scholarship of an objective historian against the methods employed by [[David Irving]], as before the ''Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt'' trial, there was no legal precedent for what constituted an objective historian.{{sfn|Schneider|2001|p=1531}}\n\n[[Charles Gray (English judge)|Justice Gray]] leant heavily on the research of one of the expert witnesses, [[Richard J. Evans]], who compared [[Historical revisionism (negationism)#Revisionist techniques|illegitimate distortion of the historical record]] practice by [[holocaust denier]]s with established historical methodologies.{{sfn|Schneider|2001|p=1534}}\n\nBy summarising Gray's judgement, in an article published in the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', Wendie E. Schneider distils these seven points for what he meant by an objective historian:{{sfn|Schneider|2001|pp=1534, 1535}}\n{{quote|\n#The historian must treat sources with appropriate reservations;\n#The historian must not dismiss counterevidence without scholarly consideration;\n#The historian must be even-handed in treatment of evidence and eschew \"cherry-picking\";\n#The historian must clearly indicate any speculation;\n#The historian must not mistranslate documents or mislead by omitting parts of documents;\n#The historian must weigh the authenticity of all accounts, not merely those that contradict his or her favored view; and\n#The historian must take the motives of historical actors into consideration.\n}}\n\nSchneider uses the concept of the \"objective historian\" to suggest that this could be an aid in assessing what makes an historian suitable as an expert witnesses under the [[Daubert standard]] in the United States. Schneider proposed this, because, in her opinion, Irving could have passed the standard Daubert tests unless a court was given \"a great deal of assistance from historians\".{{sfn|Schneider|2001|pp=1534, 1538}}\n\nSchneider proposes that by testing an historian against the criteria of the \"objective historian\" then, even if an historian holds specific political views (and she gives an example of a well-qualified historian's testimony that was disregarded by a United States court because he was a member of a feminist group), providing the historian uses the \"objective historian\" standards, he or she is a \"conscientious historian\". It was Irving's failure as an \"objective historian\" not his right wing views that caused him to lose his libel case, as a \"conscientious historian\" would not have \"deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence\" to support his political views.{{sfn|Schneider|2001|p=1539}}<ref>\"deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence\" Justice Charles Gray {{harv|Schneider|2001|p=1533}}</ref>\n\n==History analysis==\n{{Main article|Historical method}}\n\nThe process of historical analysis involves investigation and analysis of competing ideas, facts, and purported facts to create coherent [[narrative]]s that explain \"what happened\" and \"why or how it happened\". Modern historical analysis usually draws upon other social sciences, including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[politics]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[linguistics]]. While ancient writers do not normally share modern historical practices, their work remains valuable for its insights within the cultural context of the times. An important part of the contribution of many modern historians is the verification or dismissal of earlier historical accounts through reviewing newly discovered sources and recent scholarship or through parallel disciplines like [[archaeology]].\n\n==Historiography==\n{{Main article|Historiography}}\n\n===Ancient===\n[[File:Thucydides Manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright|Reproduction of part of a tenth-century copy of [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''.]]\nUnderstanding the past appears to be a universal human need, and the telling of history has emerged independently in civilizations around the world. What constitutes history is a philosophical question (see [[philosophy of history]]). The earliest [[Chronology|chronologies]] date back to [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], though no historical writers in these early civilizations were known by name.\n\n[[Greek historiography|Systematic historical thought]] emerged in [[ancient Greece]], a development that became an important influence on the writing of history elsewhere around [[History of the Mediterranean region|the Mediterranean]] region. The earliest known critical historical works were ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', composed by [[Herodotus|Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484 \u2013 {{annum|c.&nbsp;425|[[Before Common Era|BCE]]}}) who later became known as the \"father of history\" ([[Cicero]]). Herodotus attempted to distinguish between more and less reliable accounts, and personally conducted research by travelling extensively, giving written accounts of various [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] cultures. Although Herodotus' overall emphasis lay on the actions and characters of men, he also attributed an important role to divinity in the determination of historical events. [[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta, establishing a rationalistic element that set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event, while his successor [[Xenophon]] ({{c.|lk=no|431}} \u2013 {{annum|355|BCE}}) introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]].\n\n[[Image:Leonardo Bruni - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Leonardo Bruni]] (c.1370\u20131444), the historian who first divided history into the three eras of [[Ancient history|Antiquity]], the [[Middle Ages]], and [[Modern history|Modern times]].]]\nThe [[Roman historiography|Romans adopted the Greek tradition]]. While early Roman works were still written in Greek, the ''Origines'', composed by the Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]] ({{annum|234\u2013149|BCE}}), was written in Latin, in a conscious effort to counteract Greek cultural influence. [[Strabo]] ({{annum|63|BCE}} \u2013 {{annum|{{c.|lk=no|24}}|[[Common Era|CE]]}}) was an important exponent of the Greco-Roman tradition of combining geography with history, presenting a descriptive history of peoples and places known to his era. [[Livy]] ({{annum|59|BCE}} \u2013 {{annum|17|CE}}) records the rise of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] from [[city-state]] to [[empire]]. His speculation about what would have happened if [[Alexander the Great]] had marched against Rome represents the first known instance of [[alternate history]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy09.html |title=Livy's History of Rome: Book 9 |publisher=Mcadams.posc.mu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Chinese historiography]], the ''[[Classic of History]]'' is one of the [[Five Classics]] of [[Chinese classic texts]] and one of the earliest narratives of China.  The ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from {{annum|722 to 481|BCE}}, is among the earliest surviving Chinese historical texts arranged on [[Annals|annalistic]] principles. [[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum|100|BCE}}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the ''[[Shiji]]'' (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''), a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the {{annum|16th century|BCE}}, and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras.<ref>{{cite book|author=J\u00f6rn R\u00fcsen|title=Time and History: The Variety of Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvGyzu-nLaUC&pg=PA54|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-349-7|pages=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Beda Petersburgiensis f3v.jpg|left|upright|thumb|A page of [[Bede]]'s ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'']]\nChristian historiography began early, perhaps as early as [[Luke-Acts]], which is the [[primary source]] for the [[Apostolic Age]]. Writing history was popular among Christian monks and clergy in the [[Middle Ages]]. They wrote about the history of Jesus Christ, that of the Church and that of their patrons, the dynastic history of the local rulers.  In the [[early medieval|Early Middle Ages]] historical writing often took the form of [[annals]] or [[chronicle]]s recording events year by year, but this style tended to hamper the analysis of events and causes.<ref>Warren, John (1998). ''The past and its presenters: an introduction to issues in historiography'', Hodder & Stoughton, {{ISBN|0-340-67934-4}}, pp. 78\u201379.</ref> An example of this type of writing is the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]s, which were the work of several different writers: it was started during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] in the late 9th&nbsp;century, but one copy was still being updated in 1154.\n\n[[Muslim]] [[Historiography of early Islam|historical writings]] first began to develop in the 7th century, with the reconstruction of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s life in the centuries following his death. With numerous conflicting narratives regarding Muhammad and his [[Sahaba|companions]] from various sources, scholars had to verify which sources were more reliable. To evaluate these sources, they developed various methodologies, such as the ''[[Ilm ar-Rijal|science of biography]]'', ''[[science of hadith]]'' and ''[[Isnad]]'' (chain of transmission). They later applied these methodologies to other historical figures in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]]. Famous historians in this tradition include [[Urwah ibn Zubayr|Urwah]] (d.&nbsp;712), [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] (d.&nbsp;728), [[Ibn Ishaq]] (d.&nbsp;761), [[al-Waqidi]] (745\u2013822), [[Ibn Hisham]] (d.&nbsp;834), [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] (810\u2013870) and [[Ibn Hajar Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]] (1372\u20131449).\n\n===Enlightenment===\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the modern development of historiography through the application of scrupulous methods began.\n\n[[File:Voltaire-Baquoy.gif|thumb|[[Voltaire]]'s works of history are an excellent example of [[Enlightenment era]] history writing. Painting by [[Pierre Charles Baquoy]].]]\nFrench ''[[Philosophes|philosophe]]'' [[Voltaire]] (1694\u20131778) had an enormous influence on the art of history writing. His best-known histories are ''The Age of Louis XIV'' (1751), and ''Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations'' (1756). \"My chief object,\" he wrote in 1739, \"is not political or military history, it is the history of the arts, of commerce, of civilization \u2013 in a word, \u2013 of the human mind.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=E.

He was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture, and political history.\n\n[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) was a masterpiece of late 18th-century history writing.]]\nAt the same time, philosopher [[David Hume]] was having a similar impact on history in [[Great Britain]]. In 1754, he published the ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|History of England]]'', a six-volume work that extended from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688.

Michelet was one of the first historians to shift the emphasis of history to the common people, rather than the leaders and institutions of the country.

Beginning with his first book in 1824, the ''History of the Latin and Teutonic Peoples from 1494 to 1514'', Ranke used an unusually wide variety of sources for an historian of the age, including \"memoirs, diaries, personal and formal missives, government documents, diplomatic dispatches and first-hand accounts of eye-witnesses\". Over a career that spanned much of the century, Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing, introducing such ideas as reliance on [[primary source]]s ([[empiricism]]), an emphasis on [[narrative history]] and especially international politics (''[[political history|aussenpolitik]]'').<ref>E. Sreedharan, ''A textbook of historiography, 500&nbsp;BC to AD&nbsp;2000'' (2004) p 185</ref>  Sources had to be hard, not speculations and rationalizations.

In general, Whig historians emphasized the rise of [[constitutional government]], [[personal freedom]]s, and [[scientific progress]]. The term has been also applied widely in historical disciplines outside of [[British history]] (the [[history of science]], for example) to criticize any [[Teleology|teleological]] (or goal-directed), hero-based, and [[Transhistoricity|transhistorical]] narrative.<ref>Ernst Mayr, \"When Is Historiography Whiggish?\" ''Journal of the History of Ideas,'' April 1990, Vol. 51 Issue 2, pp 301\u2013309 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2709517 in JSTOR]</ref> Butterfield's antidote to Whig history was \"...to evoke a certain sensibility towards the past, the sensibility which studies the past 'for the sake of the past', which delights in the concrete and the complex, which 'goes out to meet the past', which searches for 'unlikenesses between past and present'.\"<ref>Adrian Wilson and T.

The school emphasized the use of quantification and the paying of special attention to geography.<ref>Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'\u00e9volution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).</ref><ref>[http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ Editions.ehess.fr]</ref> An eminent member of this school, [[Georges Duby]], described his approach to history as one that <blockquote>relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events, but strived on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting surface disturbances, to observe the long and medium-term evolution of economy, society, and civilisation.</blockquote>\n\n[[Marxist historiography]] developed as a school of historiography influenced by the chief tenets of [[Marxism]], including the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes. [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', which was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics from then on, e.g. the [[Fabian Society]]. [[R. H. Tawney]]'s ''The Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century'' (1912)<ref>[[William Rose Ben\u00e9t]] (1988) p.&nbsp;961</ref> and ''Religion and the Rise of Capitalism'' (1926), reflected his ethical concerns and preoccupations in economic history. A [[Communist Party Historians Group|circle of historians]] inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946 and became a highly influential cluster of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]], who contributed to [[history from below]] and class structure in early capitalist society. Members included [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[E. P. Thompson]].\n\n[[World history]], as a distinct field of historical study, emerged as an independent academic field in the 1980s. It focused on the examination of [[history]] from a global perspective and looked for common [[pattern]]s that emerged across all cultures. [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s ten-volume ''A Study of History'', written between 1933 and 1954, was an important influence on this developing field. He took a comparative topical approach to independent civilizations and demonstrated that they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay.<ref>William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J.

His best-known works include ''[[Demian]]'', ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'', ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]'', and ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]'', each of which explores an individual's search for [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]], self-knowledge and [[spirituality]]. In 1946, he received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\n== Life and work ==\n\n=== Family background ===\nHermann Karl Hesse<ref>German Wikipedia, other sources.</ref> was born on 2 July 1877 in the [[Black Forest]] town of [[Calw]] in [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]], German Empire (Deutsches-Kaiserreich).  His grandparents served in India at a mission under the auspices of the [[Basel Mission]], a Protestant Christian missionary society. His grandfather [[Hermann Gundert]] compiled the current grammar in [[Malayalam]] language, compiled a Malayalam-English dictionary, and also contributed to the work in translating the Bible to Malayalam.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6EFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA14-IA11 | title=A Malayalam and English Dictionary| last1=Gundert| first1=Hermann| year=1872}}</ref> Hesse's mother, Marie Gundert, was born at such a mission in India in 1842.  In describing her own childhood, she said, \"A happy child I was not...\" As was usual among missionaries at the time, she was left behind in Europe at the age of four when her parents returned to India.<ref>{{Citation | last = Gundert | first = Adele |trans-title=Marie Hesse: A life picture in letters and diaries | language = de | title = Marie Hesse: Ein Lebensbild in Briefen und Tagebuchern}} as quoted in Freedman (1978) pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hermann Hesse House.JPG|thumb|Hesse's birthplace, 2007]]\n\nHesse's father, Johannes Hesse, the son of a doctor, was born in 1847 in the [[Estonia]]n town of [[Paide]] (Weissenstein). Johannes Hesse belonged to the German minority in the Russian-ruled [[Baltic region]]: thus his son Hermann was at birth both a citizen of the [[German Empire]] and the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Weltb\u00fcrger \u2013 Hermann Hesses \u00fcbernationales und multikulturelles Denken und Wirken | language = de |trans-title=Hermann Hesse's international and multicultural thinking and work | type = exhibition | publisher = Hermann-Hesse-Museum | place = City of Calw | date = 2 July 2009 to 7 February 2010}}.</ref>  Hermann had five siblings, but two of them died in infancy. In 1873, the Hesse family moved to Calw, where Johannes worked for the Calwer Verlagsverein, a publishing house specializing in theological texts and schoolbooks. Marie's father, [[Hermann Gundert]] (also the namesake of his grandson), managed the publishing house at the time, and Johannes Hesse succeeded him in 1893.\n\nHesse grew up in a [[Swabia]]n [[Pietism|Pietist]] household, with the Pietist tendency to insulate believers into small, deeply thoughtful groups. Furthermore, Hesse described his father's [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] heritage as \"an important and potent fact\" of his developing identity. His father, Hesse stated, \"always seemed like a very polite, very foreign, lonely, little-understood guest.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated414\">{{Citation | first = Hermann | last = Hesse | title = Briefe | language = de |trans-title=Letters | place = Frankfurt am Main | publisher = Verlag Suhrkamp | year = 1964 | page = 414}}.</ref> His father's tales from Estonia instilled a contrasting sense of religion in young Hermann. \"[It was] an exceedingly cheerful, and, for all its Christianity, a merry world... We wished for nothing so longingly as to be allowed to see this Estonia... where life was so paradisiacal, so colorful and happy.\" Hermann Hesse's sense of estrangement from the Swabian petty bourgeoisie further grew through his relationship with his maternal grandmother Julie Gundert, {{n\u00e9e}} Dubois, whose French-Swiss heritage kept her from ever quite fitting in among that milieu.<ref name=\"autogenerated414\" />\n\n=== Childhood ===\nFrom childhood, Hesse appeared headstrong and hard for his family to handle. In a letter to her husband, Hermann's mother Marie wrote: \"The little fellow has a life in him, an unbelievable strength, a powerful will, and, for his four years of age, a truly astonishing mind. How can he express all that? It truly gnaws at my life, this internal fighting against his tyrannical temperament, his passionate turbulence [...] God must shape this proud spirit, then it will become something noble and magnificent \u2013 but I shudder to think what this young and passionate person might become should his upbringing be false or weak.\"<ref>Volker Michels (ed.): ''\u00dcber Hermann Hesse''.

Click to see an enlarged image, in which the statue of Hesse can be seen near the center.]]\nHesse showed signs of serious depression as early as his first year at school.<ref>Freedman, p. 30</ref>\nIn his [[juvenilia]] collection ''Gerbersau,'' Hesse vividly describes experiences and anecdotes from his childhood and youth in Calw: the atmosphere and adventures by the river, the bridge, the chapel, the houses leaning closely together, hidden nooks and crannies, as well as the inhabitants with their admirable qualities, their oddities, and their idiosyncrasies. The fictional town of Gerbersau is pseudonymous for Calw, imitating the real name of the nearby town of [[Hirsau]]. It is derived from the German words ''gerber'', meaning \"tanner,\" and ''aue'', meaning \"meadow.\"<ref>An English equivalent would be \"Tannersmead.\"</ref> Calw had a centuries-old leather-working industry, and during Hesse's childhood the tanneries' influence on the town was still very much in evidence.<ref>Siegfried Greiner ''Hermann Hesse, Jugend in Calw'', Thorbecke (1981), {{ISBN|3799520090}} p. viii</ref> Hesse's favorite place in Calw was the St. Nicholas-Bridge (''Nikolausbr\u00fccke''), which is why the Hesse monument was built there in 2002.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nHermann Hesse's grandfather [[Hermann Gundert]], a doctor of philosophy and fluent in multiple languages, encouraged the boy to read widely, giving him access to his library, which was filled with the works of world literature. All this instilled a sense in Hermann Hesse that he was a citizen of the world. His family background became, he noted, \"the basis of an isolation and a resistance to any sort of nationalism that so defined my life.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated414\"/>\n\nYoung Hesse shared a love of music with his mother. Both music and poetry were important in his family. His mother wrote poetry, and his father was known for his use of language in both his sermons and the writing of religious tracts. His first role model for becoming an artist was his half-brother, Theo, who rebelled against the family by entering a music conservatory in 1885.<ref>Freedman (1978) pp. 30\u201332</ref>  Hesse showed a precocious ability to rhyme, and by 1889\u201390 had decided that he wanted to be a writer.<ref>Freedman (1978) p. 39</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\nIn 1881, when Hesse was four, the family moved to [[Basel]], Switzerland, staying for six years and then returning to Calw. After successful attendance at the Latin School in [[G\u00f6ppingen]], Hesse entered the [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren|Evangelical Theological Seminary]] of [[Maulbronn Abbey]] in 1891. The pupils lived and studied at the abbey, one of Germany's most beautiful and well-preserved, attending 41 hours of classes a week. Although Hesse did well during the first months, writing in a letter that he particularly enjoyed writing essays and translating classic Greek poetry into German, his time in Maulbronn was the beginning of a serious personal crisis.<ref>Zeller, pp.  26\u201330</ref> In March 1892, Hesse showed his rebellious character, and, in one instance, he fled from the Seminary and was found in a field a day later. Hesse began a journey through various institutions and schools and experienced intense conflicts with his parents. In May, after an attempt at suicide, he spent time at an institution in [[Bad Boll]] under the care of theologian and minister [[Christoph Friedrich Blumhardt]]. Later, he was placed in a mental institution in [[Stetten im Remstal]], and then a boys' institution in Basel. At the end of 1892, he attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Cannstatt, now part of [[Stuttgart]]. In 1893, he passed the One Year Examination, which concluded his schooling. The same year, he began spending time with older companions and took up drinking and smoking.<ref>Freedman (1978) p. 53</ref>\n\nAfter this, Hesse began a bookshop apprenticeship in [[Esslingen am Neckar]], but quit after three days. Then, in the early summer of 1894, he began a 14-month mechanic apprenticeship at a clock tower factory in Calw. The monotony of soldering and filing work made him turn himself toward more spiritual activities. In October 1895, he was ready to begin wholeheartedly a new apprenticeship with a bookseller in [[T\u00fcbingen]]. This experience from his youth, especially his time spent at the Seminary in Maulbronn, he returns to later in his novel ''[[Beneath the Wheel]]''.\n\n=== Becoming a writer ===\n[[File:Printing4 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|upright|''Modern Book Printing'' from the [[Walk of Ideas]] in Berlin, Germany]]\nOn 17 October 1895, Hesse began working in the bookshop in T\u00fcbingen, which had a specialized collection in theology, philology, and law.<ref>[http://www.heckenhauer.de/ J. J. Heckenhauer].</ref> Hesse's tasks consisted of organizing, packing, and archiving the books. After the end of each twelve-hour workday, Hesse pursued his own work, and he spent his long, idle Sundays with books rather than friends. Hesse studied theological writings and later [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], and [[Greek mythology]]. He also began reading [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] in 1895,<ref>Freedman (1978) p. 69.</ref> and that philosopher's ideas of \"dual\u2026 impulses of passion and order\" in humankind was a heavy influence on most of his novels.<ref>Freedman (1978) p. 111.</ref>\n\nBy 1898, Hesse had a respectable income that enabled financial independence from his parents.{{citation_needed|date= March 2013}} During this time, he concentrated on the works of the [[German Romanticism|German Romantics]], including much of the work from [[Clemens Brentano]], [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]], [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]], and [[Novalis]]. In letters to his parents, he expressed a belief that \"the morality of artists is replaced by aesthetics\".\n\nDuring this time, he was introduced to the home of Fr\u00e4ulein von Reutern, a friend of his family's.  There he met with people his own age.  His relationships with his contemporaries were \"problematic\", in that most of them were now at university.  This usually left him feeling awkward in social situations.<ref>Freedman (1978) p. 64.</ref>\n\nIn 1896, his poem \"Madonna\" appeared in a [[Vienna|Viennese]] periodical and Hesse released his first small volume of poetry, ''Romantic Songs.'' In 1897, a published poem of his, \"Grand Valse\", drew him a fan letter.  It was from [[Helene Voigt-Diederichs|Helene Voigt]], who the next year married [[Eugen Diederichs]], a young publisher.  To please his wife, Diederichs agreed to publish Hesse's collection of prose entitled ''[[One Hour After Midnight]]'' in 1898 (although it is dated 1899).<ref>Freedman(1978) pp. 78\u201380.</ref> Both works were a business failure. In two years, only 54 of the 600 printed copies of ''Romantic Songs'' were sold, and ''One Hour After Midnight'' received only one printing and sold sluggishly. Furthermore, Hesse \"suffered a great shock\" when his mother disapproved of \"Romantic Songs\" on the grounds that they were too secular and even \"vaguely sinful.\"<ref>Freedman(1978), p. 79.</ref>\n\nFrom late 1899, Hesse worked in a distinguished antique book shop in Basel. Through family contacts, he stayed with the intellectual families of Basel. In this environment with rich stimuli for his pursuits, he further developed spiritually and artistically. At the same time, Basel offered the solitary Hesse many opportunities for withdrawal into a private life of artistic self-exploration, journeys and wanderings. In 1900, Hesse was exempted from compulsory military service due to an [[Amblyopia|eye condition]]. This, along with [[Neuralgia|nerve disorders]] and persistent headaches, affected him his entire life.\n\nIn 1901, Hesse undertook to fulfill a long-held dream and travelled for the first time to Italy. In the same year, Hesse changed jobs and began working at the antiquarium Wattenwyl in Basel. Hesse had more opportunities to release poems and small literary texts to journals. These publications now provided honorariums.  His new bookstore agreed to publish his next work, ''[[Posthumous Writings and Poems of Hermann Lauscher]]''.<ref>Freedman(1978) p. 97.</ref> In 1902, his mother died after a long and painful illness.  He could not bring himself to attend her funeral, stating in a letter to his father: \"I think it would be better for us both that I do not come, in spite of my love for my mother.\"<ref>Freedman (1978), pp. 99\u2013101.</ref>\n\nDue to the good notices that Hesse received for ''[[Lauscher]],'' the publisher [[Samuel Fischer]] became interested in Hesse<ref>Freedman (1978) p. 107.</ref> and, with the novel ''[[Peter Camenzind]]'', which appeared first as a pre-publication in 1903 and then as a regular printing by Fischer in 1904, came a breakthrough: from now on, Hesse could make a living as a writer.  The novel became popular throughout Germany.<ref>Freedman (1978) p. 108.</ref> Sigmund Freud \"praised ''[[Peter Camenzind]]'' as one of his favorite readings.\"<ref>Freedman (1978) p. 117.</ref>\n\n=== Between Lake Constance and India ===\n[[File:Hermann Hesse.jpg|thumb|1905 portrait by Ernst W\u00fcrtenberger (1868\u20131934)]]\n[[File:Hermann Hesse Desk Museum Gaienhofen.jpeg|thumb|Hesse's writing desk, pictured at the Museum Gaienhofen]]\nHaving realized he could make a living as a writer, Hesse finally married Maria Bernoulli (of the [[Bernoulli family|famous family of mathematicians]]<ref>Gustav Emil M\u00fcller, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WklYtBo4XpsC Philosophy of Literature]'', Ayer Publishing, 1976.</ref>) in 1904, while her father, who disapproved of their relationship, was away for the weekend. The couple settled down in [[Gaienhofen]] on [[Lake Constance]], and began a family, eventually having three sons. In Gaienhofen, he wrote his second novel, ''[[Beneath the Wheel]]'', which was published in 1906. In the following time, he composed primarily short stories and poems. His story \"The Wolf\", written in 1906\u201307, was \"quite possibly\" a foreshadowing of ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]''.<ref>Freedman (1978) p. 140</ref>\n\nHis next novel, ''[[Gertrud (novel)|Gertrude]]'', published in 1910, revealed a production crisis. He had to struggle through writing it, and he later would describe it as \"a miscarriage\". Gaienhofen was the place where Hesse's interest in [[Buddhism]] was re-sparked. Following a letter to Kapff in 1895 entitled ''Nirvana'', Hesse had ceased alluding to Buddhist references in his work. In 1904, however, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and his philosophical ideas started receiving attention again, and Hesse discovered [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]. Schopenhauer and theosophy renewed Hesse's interest in India. Although it was many years before the publication of Hesse's ''Siddhartha'' (1922), this masterpiece was to be derived from these new influences.\n\nDuring this time, there also was increased dissonance between him and Maria, and in 1911 Hesse left for a long trip to [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Indonesia]]. He also visited Sumatra, Borneo, and Burma, but \"the physical experience... was to depress him.\"<ref>Freedman (1978) p. 149</ref>  Any spiritual or religious inspiration that he was looking for eluded him,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} but the journey made a strong impression on his literary work. Following Hesse's return, the family moved to [[Bern]] (1912), but the change of environment could not solve the marriage problems, as he himself confessed in his novel ''[[Rosshalde]]'' from 1914.\n\n=== During the First World War ===\nAt the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, Hesse registered himself as a volunteer with the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial army]], saying that he could not sit inactively by a warm fireplace while other young authors were dying on the front. He was found unfit for combat duty, but was assigned to service involving the care of prisoners of war.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/HesseHermann/|title= Hermann Hesse Schriftsteller|accessdate= 15 January 2008|publisher= Deutsches Historisches Museum|language= German}}</ref> While most poets and authors of the war participating countries quickly became embroiled in a tirade of mutual hate, Hesse, seemingly immune to the general war-enthusiasm of the time,<ref name=z83>Zeller, p. 83</ref> wrote an essay titled \"O Friends, Not These Tones\" (\"O Freunde, nicht diese T\u00f6ne\"),{{Ref_label|a|a|none}} which was published in the ''[[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung]]'', on November 3.<ref name=Mileck>{{Cite book |year=1977 |author=Mileck, Joseph |title=Hermann Hesse: Biography and Bibliography |volume=Vol.1 |page=42 |place=Berkeley, Los Angeles, London |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-02756-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjdi21x9s1oC&pg=PR3&dq=%22Hermann+Hesse:+biography%22#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref> In this essay he appealed to his fellow intellectuals not to fall for nationalistic madness and hatred.<ref name=z83 /><ref name=Mileck/> Calling for subdued voices and a recognition of Europe's common heritage,<ref>Freedman (1978) p. 166</ref> Hesse wrote: ''[...] That love is greater than hate, understanding greater than ire, peace nobler than war, this exactly is what this unholy World War should burn into our memories, more so than ever felt before.''<ref>Zeller, pp. 83\u201384</ref> What followed from this, Hesse later indicated, was a great turning point in his life: For the first time, he found himself in the middle of a serious political conflict, attacked by the German press, the recipient of hate mail, and distanced from old friends. He did receive continued support from his friend [[Theodor Heuss]], and the French writer [[Romain Rolland]], who visited Hesse in August 1915.<ref>Freedman (1978) pp. 170\u201371.</ref> In 1917, Hesse wrote to Rolland, \"The attempt...to apply love to matters political has failed.\"<ref>Freedman (1978) p. 189</ref>\n\nThis public controversy was not yet resolved when a deeper life crisis befell Hesse with the death of his father on 8 March 1916, the serious illness of his son Martin, and his wife's [[schizophrenia]]. He was forced to leave his military service and begin receiving [[psychotherapy]]. This began for Hesse a long preoccupation with [[psychoanalysis]], through which he came to know [[Carl Jung]] personally, and was challenged to new creative heights. During a three-week period in September and October 1917, Hesse penned his novel ''[[Demian]]'', which would be published following the armistice in 1919 under the [[pseudonym]] Emil Sinclair.\n\n=== Casa Camuzzi ===\nBy the time Hesse returned to civilian life in 1919, his marriage had shattered. His wife had a severe episode of [[psychosis]], but, even after her recovery, Hesse saw no possible future with her. Their home in Bern was divided, their children were accommodated in pensions and by relatives,<ref>Zeller, p. 93</ref> and Hesse resettled alone in the middle of April in [[Ticino]]. He occupied a small farm house near Minusio (close to Locarno), living from 25 April to 11 May in Sorengo. On 11 May, he moved to the town [[Montagnola]] and rented four small rooms in a castle-like building, the Casa Camuzzi. Here, he explored his writing projects further; he began to paint, an activity reflected in his next major story, \"[[Klingsor's Last Summer]]\", published in 1920. This new beginning in different surroundings brought him happiness, and Hesse later called his first year in Ticino \"the fullest, most prolific, most industrious and most passionate time of my life.\"<ref>Zeller, p. 94</ref> In 1922, Hesse's novella ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]'' appeared, which showed the love for Indian culture and Buddhist philosophy that had already developed earlier in his life. In 1924, Hesse married the singer Ruth Wenger, the daughter of the Swiss writer [[Lisa Wenger]] and aunt of [[M\u00e9ret Oppenheim]]. This marriage never attained any stability, however.\n\nIn 1923, Hesse received Swiss citizenship. His next major works, ''Kurgast'' (1925) and ''The Nuremberg Trip'' (1927), were autobiographical narratives with ironic undertones and foreshadowed Hesse's following novel, ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'', which was published in 1927. In the year of his 50th birthday, the first biography of Hesse appeared, written by his friend [[Hugo Ball]]. Shortly after his new successful novel, he turned away from the solitude of Steppenwolf and married art historian Ninon Dolbin, {{n\u00e9e}} Ausl\u00e4nder. This change to companionship was reflected in the novel ''[[Narcissus and Goldmund]]'', appearing in 1930. In 1931, Hesse left the Casa Camuzzi and moved with Ninon to a large house (Casa Hesse) near [[Montagnola]], which was built according to his wishes.\n\nIn 1931, Hesse began planning what would become his last major work, ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]'' (a.k.a. ''Magister Ludi''). In 1932, as a preliminary study, he released the novella ''[[Journey to the East]]''. ''The Glass Bead Game'' was printed in 1943 in Switzerland. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1946.\n\n=== Religious views ===\n\nAs reflected in ''Demian'', and other works, he believed that \"for different people, there are different ways to God\";<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.adherents.com/people/ph/Hermann_Hesse.html | work = Adherents | title = The Religious Affiliation of Nobel Prize-winning author Hermann Hesse}}.</ref> but despite the influence he drew from Indian and Buddhist philosophies, he stated about his parents: \u201ctheir [[Christianity]], one not preached but lived, was the strongest of the powers that shaped and moulded me\".<ref>{{Citation | last = Hesse | first = Hermann | year = 1951 | title = Gesammelte Werke |trans-title=Collected Works | publisher = Suhrkamp Verlag | page = 378 | quote = Von ihnen bin ich erzogen, von ihnen habe ich die Bibel und Lehre vererbt bekommen, Ihr nicht gepredigtes, sondern gelebtes Christentum ist unter den M\u00e4chten, die mich erzogen und geformt haben, die st\u00e4rkste gewesen [I have been educated by them; I have inherited the Bible and doctrine from them; their Christianity,  not preached, but lived, has been the strongest among the powers that educated and formed me] | language = de}}.

In 1933, [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Thomas Mann]] made their travels into exile, each aided by Hesse. In this way, Hesse attempted to work against [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s suppression of art and literature that protested Nazi ideology. Hesse's third wife was Jewish, and he had publicly expressed his opposition to anti-Semitism long before then.<ref>Galbreath (1974) Robert. \"Hermann Hesse and the Politics of Detachment\", p. 63, ''Political Theory'', vol. 2, No 1 (Feb 1974).</ref>  Hesse was criticized for not condemning the Nazi party, but his failure to criticize or support any political idea stemmed from his \"politics of detachment [...] At no time did he openly condemn (the Nazis), although his detestation of their politics is beyond question.\"<ref>Galbreath (1974) Robert. \"Hermann Hesse and the Politics of Detachment\", p. 64, ''Political Theory'', vol. 2, No 1 (Feb 1974)</ref> From the end of the 1930s, German journals stopped publishing Hesse's work, and the Nazis eventually banned it.\n\n''The Glass Bead Game'' was Hesse's last novel. During the last twenty years of his life, Hesse wrote many short stories (chiefly recollections of his childhood) and poems (frequently with nature as their theme). Hesse also wrote ironic essays about his alienation from writing (for instance, the mock autobiographies: ''Life Story Briefly Told'' and ''Aus den Briefwechseln eines Dichters'') and spent much time pursuing his interest in watercolors. Hesse also occupied himself with the steady stream of letters he received as a result of the Nobel Prize and as a new generation of German readers explored his work. In one essay, Hesse reflected wryly on his lifelong failure to acquire a talent for idleness and speculated that his average daily correspondence exceeded 150 pages. He died on 9 August 1962, aged 85, and was buried in the cemetery at [[Sant\u2019Abbondio|San Abbondio]] in [[Montagnola]], where [[Hugo Ball]] and the great conductor [[Bruno Walter]] are also buried.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Hermann Hesse Bueste.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Statue in [[Calw]]]]\nIn his time, Hesse was a popular and influential author in the German-speaking world; worldwide fame only came later. Hesse's first great novel, ''[[Peter Camenzind]]'', was received enthusiastically by young Germans desiring a different and more \"natural\" way of life in this time of great economic and technological progress in the country (see also [[Wandervogel]] movement).<ref>Prinz, pp. 139\u201342</ref>'' [[Demian]]'' had a strong and enduring influence on the generation returning home from the [[First World War]].<ref>Zeller, p. 90</ref> Similarly, ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]'', with its disciplined intellectual world of Castalia and the powers of meditation and humanity, captivated Germans' longing for a new order amid the chaos of a broken nation following the loss in the [[Second World War]].<ref>Zeller, p. 186</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, Hesse's popularity began to wane, while literature critics and intellectuals turned their attention to other subjects. In 1955, the sales of Hesse's books by his publisher [[Suhrkamp Verlag|Suhrkamp]] reached an all-time low. However, after Hesse's death in 1962, posthumously published writings, including letters and previously unknown pieces of prose, contributed to a new level of understanding and appreciation of his works.<ref>Zeller, pp. 180\u201381</ref>\n\nBy the time of Hesse's death in 1962, his works were still relatively little read in the United States, despite his status as a Nobel laureate. A memorial published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' went so far as to claim that Hesse's works were largely \"inaccessible\" to American readers. The situation changed in the mid-1960s, when Hesse's works suddenly became bestsellers in the United States.<ref name=z185>Zeller, p. 185</ref> The revival in popularity of Hesse's works has been credited to their association with some of the popular themes of the 1960s [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] (or hippie) movement. In particular, the quest-for-enlightenment theme of ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]'', ''[[Journey to the East]]'', and ''[[Narcissus and Goldmund]]'' resonated with those espousing counter-cultural ideals. The \"magic theatre\" sequences in ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'' were interpreted by some as drug-induced [[psychedelia]] although there is no evidence that Hesse ever took psychedelic drugs or recommended their use.<ref>Zeller p. 189</ref> To a large part, the Hesse boom in the United States can be traced back to enthusiastic writings by two influential counter-culture figures: [[Colin Wilson]] and [[Timothy Leary]].<ref>Zeller, p. 188</ref> From the United States, the Hesse renaissance spread to other parts of the world and even back to Germany: more than 800,000 copies were sold in the German-speaking world from 1972 to 1973. In a space of just a few years, Hesse became the most widely read and translated European author of the 20th century.<ref name=z185/> Hesse was especially popular among young readers, a tendency which continues today.<ref>Zeller p. 186</ref>\n\nThere is a quote from ''[[Demian]]'' on the cover of [[Santana (band)|Santana]]'s 1970 album ''[[Abraxas (album)|Abraxas]]'', revealing the source of the album's title.\n\nHesse's ''Siddhartha'' is one of the most popular Western novels set in India. An authorized translation of ''Siddhartha'' was published in the Malayalam language in 1990, the language that surrounded Hesse's grandfather, Hermann Gundert, for most of his life. A Hermann Hesse Society of India has also been formed. It aims to bring out authentic translations of ''Siddhartha'' in all Indian languages and has already prepared the Sanskrit,<ref>Hesse, Hermann.

Referring to \"The Magic Theatre for Madmen Only\" in ''Steppenwolf'' (a kind of spiritual and somewhat nightmarish cabaret attended by some of the characters, including Harry Haller), the Magic Theatre was founded in 1967 to perform works by new playwrights.  Founded by John Lion, the Magic Theatre has fulfilled that mission for many years, including the world premieres of many plays by Sam Shepard.\n\nThere is also a theater in Chicago named after the novel, [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company|Steppenwolf Theater]].\n\nThroughout Germany, many schools are named after him. The [[Hermann-Hesse-Literaturpreis]] is a literary prize associated with the city of [[Karlsruhe]] that has been awarded since 1957.<ref>[http://www1.karlsruhe.de/Kultur/Projekte/Kulturpreise/hhpreis03.htm Hermann-Hesse-Preis 2003] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309040720/http://www1.karlsruhe.de/Kultur/Projekte/Kulturpreise/hhpreis03.htm |date=2013-03-09 }}. karlsruhe.de</ref> Since 1990,<ref>[https://www.hermann-hesse.de/en/Preistraeger The winners of the Calw Hermann Hesse Prize]</ref> the [[Calw Hermann Hesse Prize]] has been awarded every two years alternately to a German-language literary journal and a translator of Hesse's work.<ref>[http://www.hermann-hesse.de/en/foundation Calw Hermann Hesse Prize].

Urban civilizations proper begin to emerge in the [[Chalcolithic]], in 5th to 4th millennium [[pre-dynastic Egypt|Egypt]] and in [[Ubaid period|Mesopotamia]]. The [[Bronze Age]] arises in this region during the final centuries of the 4th millennium. The urban civilizations of the [[Fertile Crescent]] now have [[Bronze Age writing|writing systems]] and develop [[bureaucracy]], by the mid-3rd millennium leading to the development of the earliest [[Empire#Early empires|Empire]]s. In the 2nd millennium, the eastern coastlines of the Mediterranean are dominated by the [[Hittite Empire|Hittite]] and [[Egyptian Empire|Egyptian]] empires, competing for control over the city states in the Levant ([[Canaan]]).\n\nThe ''[[Bronze Age collapse]]'' is the transition from the [[Late Bronze Age]] to the [[Early Iron Age]], expressed by the collapse of [[palace economy|palace economies]] of the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] and [[Anatolia]], which were replaced after a hiatus by the isolated village cultures of the [[Dark Ages in history|Dark Age period in history]] of the ancient Near East.

Muhly, ''The Coming of the Age of Iron'' (New Haven) 1980.</ref> \nThe cultural collapse of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean kingdoms]], the [[Hittites|Hittite Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] and [[Syria]], and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian Empire]] in [[Syria]] and [[Israel]], the scission of long-distance [[trade route|trade]] contacts and sudden eclipse of literacy occurred between 1206 and 1150 BC. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between [[Troy]] and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example, [[Hattusas]], [[Mycenae]], [[Ugarit]]). The gradual end of the Dark Age that ensued saw the rise of settled [[Neo-Hittite]] [[Aramaean]] kingdoms of the mid-10th century BC, and the rise of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].\n\nWhile the cultural advances during the Bronze Age had mostly been confined to the eastern parts of the Mediterranean, \nwith the Iron Age, the entire coastal region surrounding the Mediterranean now becomes involved, significantly due to the [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]] expansion from the Levant, beginning in ca. the 12th century.\n[[Fernand Braudel]] remarked in ''The Perspective of the World'' that Phoenicia was an early example of a \"world-economy\" surrounded by empires. The high point of Phoenician culture and sea power is usually placed ca. 1200\u2013800&nbsp;BC.\nMany of the most important Phoenician settlements had been established long before this: [[Byblos]], [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], and [[Beirut|Berytus]], all appear in the [[Amarna tablets]].\n\nThe Phoenicians and the Assyrians transported elements of the Late Bronze Age culture of the Near East to Iron Age [[Archaic Greece|Greece]] and [[Iron Age Italy|Italy]], but also further afield to [[Ancient Libya|Northwestern Africa]] and to [[Tartessos|Iberia]], initiating the beginning of Mediterranean history now known as [[Classical Antiquity]].\nThey notably spread [[History of the alphabet|alphabetic writing]], which would become the hallmark of the Mediterranean civilizations of the Iron Age, in contrast to the [[Assyrian cuneiform|cuneiform]] writing of Assyria and the [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|logographic]] system in the Far East (and later the [[abugida]] systems of India).\n\n== Classical antiquity ==\n[[File:Greek Colonization Archaic Period.svg|thumb|250px|[[Magna Graecia|Greek colonies]] during the 8th and 7th centuries BC.]]\nTwo of the most notable Mediterranean civilizations in [[classical antiquity]] were the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city state]]s and the [[Phoenicia]]ns. The Greeks expanded throughout the [[Black Sea]] and south through the [[Red Sea]]. The Phoenicians spread through the western Mediterranean reaching [[North Africa]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. From the 6th century BC up to including the 5th century BC, many of the significant Mediterranean peoples were under Persian rule, making them dominate the Mediterranean during these years. Both the Phoenicians and some of the [[Greek city states]] in Asia Minor provided the naval forces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].

The ''hetairoi'' ([[Companion cavalry]]) was considered the strongest of their time.<ref>Diodorus Siculus, Arrian</ref> Under [[Alexander the Great]], this force turned east, and in a series of decisive battles, it routed the Persian forces and took over as the dominant empire of the Mediterranean. Their Macedonia empire included present-day Greece, Bulgaria, Egypt, the Phoenician lands and many other basin regions of the Mediterranean and Asia Minor.\n\nThe major centres of the Mediterranean at the time became part of Alexander's empire as a result. His empire quickly disintegrated, and the Middle East, Egypt, and Greece were soon again independent. Alexander's conquests spread Greek knowledge and ideas throughout the region.\n\n===Roman\u2013Carthaginian rivalry===\n{{See also|Punic Wars|Roman Republic|Ancient Carthage|Carthage}}\n\nThese eastern powers soon began to be overshadowed by those farther west. In North Africa, the former Phoenician colony of [[Carthage]] rose to dominate its surroundings with an empire that contained many of the former Phoenician holdings. However, it was a city on the [[Italian Peninsula]], [[Rome]], that would eventually dominate the entire Mediterranean basin. Spreading first through Italy, Rome defeated Carthage in the [[Punic Wars]], despite [[Hannibal]]'s famous efforts against Rome in the [[Second Punic War]].\n\nAfter the [[Third Punic War]], Rome then became the leading force in the Mediterranean region. The Romans soon spread east, taking Greece, and the Greek heritage played an important role in the Roman Empire. By this point the coastal trading cultures were thoroughly dominant over the inland river valleys that had once been the heart of the great powers. Egyptian power moved from the Nile cities to the coastal ones, especially [[Alexandria]].  Mesopotamia became a fringe border region between the Roman Empire and the Persians.\n\n===Roman ''Mare Nostrum''===\n[[File:The Roman Empire ca 400 AD.png|thumb|250px|The ''Mare nostrum'', surrounded by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] territory in c. 400 AD.]]\n{{further|Mare Nostrum|Roman Empire}}\n\nWhen [[Augustus]] founded the [[Roman Empire]], the Mediterranean sea began to be called ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: \"Our Sea\") by the Romans. Their empire was centered on this sea and all the area was full of commerce and naval development. For the first time in history, an entire sea (the Mediterranean) was free of piracy. For several centuries, the Mediterranean was a \"Roman Lake\", surrounded on all sides by the empire.\n\nThe empire began to crumble, however, in the fifth century and [[Rome]] collapsed after 476 CE.\n\n===Byzantine times===\n{{main|Byzantine Empire}}\nThe Eastern Roman or [[Byzantine empire]] began its domination of the Levant during its [[Byzantine-Sassanid Wars|wars with neighbouring Sassanid Persia]]. The century-long rule saw a general decline in economy.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The Byzantines lost territory on Mediterranean land regularly, but remained superior in the Mediterranean sea for centuries of the empires' span. In the first quarter of the 7th century AD, the Byzantines lost swaths of the Mediterranean region to Sassanid Persia during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], though regained the lost territories by the end of the war. Ultimately, Byzantine domination in the region was forever finished by the Arabs and later the Turks, who came into the scene.\n\n== Middle Ages ==\n\n===Islamic Golden Age===\n{{further|Islamic Golden Age|Muslim conquests|Caliphate|Byzantine Empire|First Bulgarian Empire}}\n[[Image:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|thumb|250px|The expansion of the [[Caliphate]] in the Mediterranean region from 622 to 750 AD. {{legend|#a1584e|Expansion under [[Muhammad]], 622\u2013632}} {{legend|#ef9070|Expansion during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], 632\u2013661}} {{legend|#fad07d|Expansion during the [[Umayyad|Umayyad Caliphate]], 661\u2013750}}]]\n\nAnother power was rising in the east, that of [[Islam]], whilst the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Roman and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] Persian empires were both weakened by centuries of stalemate warfare during the [[Roman-Persian Wars]]. In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army|Arab armies]], motivated by Islam and led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East; [[Byzantine-Arab Wars|reducing Byzantine lands]] by more than half and completely [[Islamic conquest of Persia|engulfing the Persian lands]].\n\nThe Arab invasions disrupted the trade relations between Western and Eastern Europe while cutting the trade route with Oriental lands. This however had the indirect effect of promoting the trade across the [[Caspian Sea]]. The export of grains from [[Egypt]] was re-routed towards the [[Eastern world]]. Oriental goods like silk and spices were carried from Egypt to ports like [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Constantinople]] by sailors and Jewish merchants. The [[Viking expansion|Viking raids]] further disrupted the trade in western Europe and brought it to a halt. However, the [[Norsemen]] developed the trade from Norway to the [[White Sea]], while also trading in luxury goods from [[Al-Andalus|Spain]] and the Mediterranean. The [[Byzantine Empire under the Isaurian dynasty|Byzantines in the mid-8th century]] retook control of the area around the north-eastern part of the Mediterranean. Venetian ships from the 9th century armed themselves to counter the harassment by Arabs while concentrating trade of oriental goods at Venice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Couper |first=Alastair |title=The Geography of Sea Transport|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WFVACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=The+Geography+of+Sea+Transport&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxmJiKorfdAhXHXrwKHWxpBvQQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1317351504|page=33 \u2014 37}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Anatolia]], the Muslim [[Siege of Constantinople (718)|expansion was blocked]] by the still capable Byzantines with the help of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]]. The Byzantine provinces of [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Roman Syria]], [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]], and Sicily, however, could not mount such a resistance, and the Muslim conquerors swept through those regions. At the far west, they crossed the sea taking [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Visigothic Hispania]] before being [[Battle of Tours|halted in southern France]] by the [[Franks]]. At its greatest extent, the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] controlled 3/4 of the Mediterranean region, the only other empire besides the Roman Empire to control most of the Mediterranean Sea.<ref>Subhi Y.

After its conquest by the Christian [[Normans]], the island developed its own distinct culture with the fusion of Latin and Byzantine influences. Palermo remained a leading artistic and commercial centre of the Mediterranean well into the Middle Ages.\n\nThe [[Fatimids]] maintained trade relations with the [[Italian city-states]] like [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]]  before the Crusades, according to the [[Cairo Geniza]] documents. A document dated 996 mentions Amalfian merchants living in [[Cairo]]. Another letter states that the Genoese had traded with [[Alexandria]]. The caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah|al-Mustansir]] had allowed Amalfian merchants to reside in [[Jerusalem]] about 1060 in place of the Latin [[hospice]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Balard|first=Michel|editor-first1=Marcus Graham|editor-last1=Bull |editor-last2=Edbury|editor-first2=Peter|editor-last3=Phillips|editor-first3=Jonathan|title=The Experience of Crusading, Volume 2 \u2014 Defining the Crusader Kingdom|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2003|isbn=978-0-5217-8151-0|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=JEN-0A3icQUC&pg=PA233&dq=amalfi+cairo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiK8aeUqbfdAhVET7wKHY9gDNEQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&q&f=false|pages=23 \u201435}}</ref>\n\nEurope was reviving, however, as more organized and centralized states began to form in the later [[Middle Ages]] after the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].  Motivated by religion and dreams of conquest, the kings of Europe launched a number of [[The Crusades|Crusades]] to try to roll back Muslim power and retake the [[holy land]].  The Crusades were unsuccessful in this goal, but they were far more effective in weakening the already tottering Byzantine Empire that began to lose increasing amounts of territory to the [[Seljuk Turks]] and later to the [[Ottoman Turks]].  They also rearranged the balance of power in the Muslim world as Egypt once again emerged as a major power in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe Crusades led to flourishing of trade between Europe and the ''[[outremer]]'' region.<ref>{{cite book|last=Housley|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Housley|title=Contesting the Crusades|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-1189-8||pages=152\u201354}}</ref> Genoa, Venica and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] created colonies in regions controlled by the Crusaders and came to control the trade with the Orient. These colonies also allowed them to trade with the Eastern world.

The threat of becoming a slave was a constant fear for peasants, fishermen and merchants. Those with money or who had financial backing only feared the lack of support, should they be threatened with abduction for ransom.\n\nThere were several things which could happen to people in the Mediterranean region of the Middle Ages:\n\n1. When [[wikt:corsair|Corsairs]], [[piracy|pirate]], [[Barbary corsairs]], [[French corsairs]] or [[commerce raiders]] plied their trade, a peasant, fisherman or coastal villager, who had no financial backing, could be abducted or sold to slave traders, or adversaries, who made large profits on an international market;\n\n2. If the captive was wealthy or had influential supporters, the captive could be ransomed. This would be the most advantageous plan, since the money exchange was immediate and direct, not long and drawn out as in the slave market business;\n\n3. The captive could be used immediately by the corsair for labour on the ship rather than traded.\nIn battles during this era, prisoners of war were often captured and used as slaves.\n\nEmperors would take large numbers of prisoners, parade them through the capital, hold feasts in honour of their capture and parade diplomats in front of them as a display of victory.<ref name=\"Europe and the Islamic World: A History \">{{cite book|author1=Tolan, John |author2=Veinstein, Gilles |author3=Henry Laurens |title=\"Europe and the Islamic World: A History\".|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-14705-5|pages=67\u201368}}</ref>\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\n{{further|Republic of Genoa|Republic of Venice|Republic of Ragusa|Crown of Aragon|Crown of Castile|Ottoman Empire}}\n\n[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|250px|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].]]\nThe Italian \"Repubbliche Marinare\" (Maritime Republics) of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] developed their own \"empires\" in the Mediterranean shores. The Islamic states had never been major naval powers, and trade from the east to Europe was soon in the hands of Italian traders, especially the Genoese and the Venetians, who profited immensely from it. The [[Republic of Pisa]] and later the [[Republic of Ragusa]] used diplomacy to further trade and maintained a libertarian approach in civil matters to further sentiment in its inhabitants.\n\nThe [[republic of Venice]] got to dominate the eastern mediterranean shores after the [[Fourth Crusade]].{{Sfn|Banaji|2007|p=62-63}}\n\nBetween 1275 and 1344 a struggle for the control of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] took place. Featuring the [[Marinid Sultanate]], the [[Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]], the [[Crown of Castile]], the [[Crown of Arag\u00f3n]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the [[Republic of Genoa]], it was characterized by changing alliances between the main actors.{{Sfn|L\u00f3pez|1996\u20131997|p=405}} The iberian cities of [[Tarifa]], [[Ceuta]], [[Algeciras]] or [[Ronda]] and the African port of [[Ceuta]] were at stake.{{Sfn|L\u00f3pez|1996\u20131997|p=405}}\nThe Western Mediterranean sea was dominated by the [[Crown of Aragon]]: thanks to their possessions of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Duchy of Athens]] the [[Duchy of Neopatria]], and several northern African cities.\n\nIn 1347 the [[Black Death]] spread from [[Constantinople]] across the mediterranean basin.{{Sfn|Sola|2006|p=46}}\n\nOttoman power continued to grow, and in 1453, the Byzantine Empire was extinguished with the [[fall of Constantinople]].  The Ottomans already controlled Greece, [[Bulgaria]] and much of the Balkans and soon also began to spread through North Africa. North Africa had grown wealthy from the trade across the [[Sahara Desert]], but the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who, along with other Christian powers, had been engaged in a long campaign to evict the Muslims from Iberia, had found a method to circumvent this trade by trading directly with [[West Africa]].  This was enabled by a new type of ships, the [[caravel]], that made trade in the rough Atlantic waters profitable for the first time.  The reduction in the Saharan trade weakened North Africa, and made them an easy target for the Ottomans.\n\nCeuta was ultimately taken by the Kingdom of Portugal in 1415, searching to undermine Castilian, Aragonese, and Genoese interests in the area.{{Sfn|Banaji|2007|pp=49; 63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, rival Christian and Muslim kingdoms forbade the trade of particular goods to enemy kingdoms including weaponry and other contraband items. The popes forbade the export of these commodities to the Islamic world. The Ottomans too forbade the export of weapons and other strategic items, declaring them ''memnu e\u015fya'' or ''memnu olan'' to Christian states even in peace treaties, however friendly states could import some of the prohibited goods through [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|capitulations]]. Despite these prohibitions, trade of contraband occurred on both sides. The European merchants traded in illegal goods with Muslims. The Ottomans were unable to suppress the trade with smuggling being undertaken mainly in the winter when the [[Ottoman Navy]] stationed at the [[Imperial Arsenal|Istanbul Arsenal]] was unable to stop Ottoman and non-Ottoman vessels from indulging in the trade.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|authors=Ga \u0301bor A \u0301goston, Bruce Alan Masters|page=145|publisher=Infobase Publishing}}</ref>\n\n== Modern era ==\n{{further|Ottoman Empire|Portuguese Empire|Spanish Empire|Italian Empire}}\n\n[[File:OttomanEmpireIn1683.png|thumb|250px|[[Ottoman Empire]] territories acquired between 1300 and 1683.]]\n[[Image:ItalianMareNostrum.jpg|thumb|250px|Greatest extent of Italian control of the Mediterranean littoral and seas (within green line & dots) in summer/fall 1942. Allied-controlled areas in red.]]\nThe growing naval prowess of the European powers confronted further rapid Ottoman expansion in the region when the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] checked the power of the Ottoman navy. However, as [[Braudel]] argued forcefully, this only slowed the Ottoman expansion instead of ending it. The prized island of [[Cyprus]] became Ottoman in 1571. The last resistance in [[Tunisia]] ended in 1574 and almost a generation long siege in [[Crete]] pushed Venetians out of this strategic island in 1669.\n\nA [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] was then established between [[Spain]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] until the 18th century, each dominating their respective half of Mediterranean, reducing Italian navies as naval powers increasingly more irrelevant. Furthermore, the Ottoman Empire had succeeded in their objective of extending Muslim rule across the North African coast.\n\nThe development of long range seafaring had an influence upon the entire Mediterranean. While once all trade from the east had passed through the region, the [[Portuguese discoveries|circumnavigation of Africa]] allowed [[gold]], [[spices]], and [[dyes]] to be imported directly to the Atlantic ports of western Europe.  The Americas were also a source of extreme wealth to the western powers, from which some of the Mediterranean states were largely cut off.\n\nThe base of European power thus shifted northward and the once wealthy [[Italy]] became a peripheral area dominated by foreigners.  The Ottoman Empire also began a slow decline that saw its North African possessions gain de facto independence and its European holdings gradually reduced by the increasing power of Austria and Russia.\n\nBy the nineteenth century the European States were vastly more powerful, and began to colonize North Africa.  France spread its power south by taking [[Algeria]] in 1830 and later [[Tunisia]]. Britain gained control of [[Egypt]] in 1882. [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italy]] conquered [[Libya]] from the Ottomans in 1911. Greece [[Greek War of Independence|achieved independence in 1832]]. The Ottoman Empire finally collapsed in the [[World War I|First World War]], and its holdings were carved up among France and Britain. The [[rump state]] of the wider Ottoman Empire became the independent state of [[Turkey]] in 1923. Yugoslavia was created from the former Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the First World War.\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century the Mediterranean was at the center of the expansion of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]], and was one of the main areas of battle during [[World War II]] between the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Post-world war period was marked by increasing activity in the Eastern Mediterranean, where naval actions formed part of ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict and Turkey had [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|occupied the northern part of Cyprus]]. Cold War tensions split the Mediterranean into pro-American and pro-Soviet factions, with Turkey, Greece, Spain, Italy and France being [[NATO]] members. Syria was socialist and a pro-Soviet regime, offering the Soviets [[Tartus|a port for their navy]] from an agreement in 1971. Yugoslavia was Communist but in neither the Soviet nor American camps. Egypt tilted towards the Soviets during the time of [[Nasser]] but then turned towards American influence during the time of [[Sadat]]. Israel and Egypt both received massive American military aid. American naval power made the Mediterranean a base for the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] during the Cold war.\n\nToday, the Mediterranean Sea is the southern border of the [[European Union]] and represents one of the largest area by Trade in the World. \nThe Maltese prime minister described the Mediterranean sea as a \"cemetery\" due to the large amounts of migrants who drown there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/10/migrant-deaths-prompt-calls-eu-action-2013101361646517233.html|title=Migrant deaths prompt calls for EU action|website=Aljazeera.com|accessdate=27 October 2018}}</ref>\nFollowing the [[2013 Lampedusa migrant shipwreck]], the Italian government, has decided to strengthen the national system for the patrolling of the Mediterranean Sea by authorizing [[Operation Mare Nostrum]], a military and humanitarian operation in order to rescue the migrants and arrest the traffickers of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurasia-rivista.org/loperazione-mare-nostrum/20335/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718050114/http://www.eurasia-rivista.org/loperazione-mare-nostrum/20335/ |archivedate=2014-07-18 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eastern Mediterranean]]\n* [[History of Anatolia]]\n* [[History of North Africa]]\n* [[History of the Levant]]\n* [[History of Western civilization]]\n* [[Life zones of the Mediterranean region]]\n* [[Mediterranean Basin]]\n* [[Union for the Mediterranean]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{Cite journal|journal=[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism]]|volume=15|year=2007|pages=47\u201374|title=Islam, the Mediterranean and the Rise of Capitalism|first=Jairus|last=Banaji|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/15983/1/Islam%20and%20capitalism.pdf|location=Leiden|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Koninklijke Brill]]|issn=1465-4466}}\n* {{Cite journal|title=De nuevo sobre la \"guerra del Estrecho\" la contribuci\u00f3n financiera del reino de Valencia en la \u00faltima fase del conflicto (1332\u20131344)|first=Mar\u00eda Dolores|last=L\u00f3pez|journal=Anales de la Universidad de Alicante.

They argued that existing neural models had failed to produce intelligent behaviour because they were too small, and that in order to create \"artificial brains\" it was necessary to manually assemble tens of thousands of evolved neural modules together, with the billion neuron \"CAM-Brain\" requiring around 10&nbsp;million modules;<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Michael Korkin |author2=Hugo de Garis |author3=Felix Gers |author4=Hitoshi Hemmi | year = 1999 | title = ''CBM (CAM-Brain Machine)'': A hardware tool which evolves a neural net module in a fraction of a second and runs a million neuron artificial brain in real time | journal = Genetic Programming 1997: Proceedings of the Second Annual Conference | url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/rd/0%2C52183%2C1%2C0.25%2CDownload/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/2145/http:zSzzSzwww.hip.atr.co.jpzSz%7EdegariszSzpaperszSzGP97final.pdf/cbm-cam-brain-machine.pdf}}</ref>  this idea was rejected by [[Igor Aleksander]], who said \"The point is that these puzzles are not puzzles because our neural models are not large enough.\"<ref>{{cite web | author = [[BBC News]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/250343.stm | title = Best brain boosts artificial life | date=7 January 1999 | accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nThough it was initially envisaged that these cellular automata would run on special computers, such as MIT's  \"Cellular Automata Machine-8\" (CAM-8), by 1996 it was realised that the model originally proposed, which required cellular automata with thousands of states, was too complex to be realised in hardware.

Terrans: A Bitter Controversy Concerning Whether Humanity Should Build Godlike Massively Intelligent Machines | isbn=0-88280-154-6 | year=2005 | publisher=ETC Publications | location=Palm Springs, CA}}</ref>\n\n'''''Cosmism''''' is a moral philosophy that favours building or growing [[Artificial general intelligence|strong artificial intelligence]] and ultimately leaving Earth to the Terrans, who oppose this path for humanity. The first half of the book describes technologies which he believes will make it possible for computers to be billions or trillions of times more intelligent than humans. He predicts that as artificial intelligence improves and becomes progressively more human-like, differing views will begin to emerge regarding how far such research should be allowed to proceed. Cosmists will foresee the massive, truly astronomical potential of substrate-independent cognition, and will therefore advocate unlimited growth in the designated fields, in the hopes that \"super intelligent\" machines might one day colonise the universe. It is this \"[[Cosmos|cosmic]]\" view of history, in which the fate of one single species, on one single planet, is seen as insignificant next to the fate of the known [[universe]], that gives the Cosmists their name.<br/>\nHugo identifies with that group and noted that it \"would be a cosmic tragedy if humanity freezes [[evolution]] at the puny human level\".<ref name=first/>\n\n'''''Terrans''''' on the other hand, will have a more \"terrestrial\" Earth-centred view, in which the fate of the Earth and its species (like humanity) are seen as being all-important. To Terrans, a future without humans is to be avoided at all costs, as it would represent ''the'' worst-case scenario. As such, Terrans will find themselves unable to ignore the possibility that super intelligent machines might one day cause the destruction of the human race\u2014being very immensely intelligent and so cosmically inclined, these artilect machines may have no more moral or ethical difficulty in exterminating humanity than humans do in using medicines to cure diseases. So, Terrans will see themselves as living during the closing of a window of opportunity, to disable future artilects before they are built, after which humans will no longer have a say in the affairs of intelligent machines.\n\nIt is these two extreme ideologies which de Garis believes may herald a new world war, wherein one group with a 'grand plan' (the Cosmists) will be rabidly opposed by another which feels itself to be under deadly threat from that plan (the Terrans). The factions, he predicts, may eventually war to the death because of this, as the Terrans will come to view the Cosmists as \"arch-monsters\" when they begin seriously discussing acceptable risks, and the probabilities of large percentages of Earth-based life going extinct. In response to this, the Cosmists will come to view the Terrans as being reactionary extremists, and will stop treating them and their ideas seriously, further aggravating the situation, possibly beyond reconciliation.\n\nThroughout his book, de Garis states that he is ambivalent about which viewpoint he ultimately supports, and attempts to make convincing cases for both sides. He elaborates towards the end of the book that the more he thinks about it, the more he feels like a Cosmist, because he feels that despite the horrible possibility that humanity might ultimately be destroyed, perhaps inadvertently or at least indifferently, by the artilects, he cannot ignore the fact that the human species is just another link in the evolutionary chain, and must become extinct in their current form anyway, whereas the artilects could very well be the ''next'' link in that chain and therefore would be excellent candidates to carry the torch of science and exploration forward into the rest of the universe.\n\nHe relates a morally isomorphic scenario in which extraterrestrial intelligences visit the earth three billion years ago and discover two domains of life living there, one domain which is ''older'' but ''simpler'' and contemporarily dominant, but which upon closer study appears to be incapable of much further evolutionary development; and one ''younger'' domain which is struggling to survive, but which upon further study displays the potential to evolve into all the varieties of life existing on the Earth today, including humanity, and then queries the reader as to whether they would feel ethically compelled to destroy the dominant domain of life to ensure the survival of the younger one, or to destroy the younger one in order to ensure the survival of the older and more populous domain which was \"there first\". He states that he believes that, like himself, most of the public would feel torn or at least ambivalent about the outcome of artilects at first, but that as the technology advances, the issue would be forced and most would feel compelled to choose a side, and that as such the public consciousness of the coming issue should be raised now so that society can ''choose'', hopefully before the factions becomes irreconcilably polarised, which outcome it prefers.\n\nDe Garis also predicts a third group that will emerge between the two. He refers to this third party as '''''Cyborgians''''' or ''Cyborgs'', because they will not be opposed to artilects as such, but desire to become artilects themselves by adding components to their own human brains, rather than falling into obsolescence. They will seek to become artilects by gradually merging themselves with machines and think that the [[dichotomy]] between the Cosmists and Terrans can be avoided because all human beings would become artilects.<ref name=artiwar/><br/>\nThe [[Transhumanism|transhumanist movement]] are usually identified as Cyborgians.<!-- <- might need a rewrite-->\n\nDe Garis' concept of the Cyborgians might have stemmed from<!-- <- might need a rewrite--> a conversation with [[Kevin Warwick]]: in 2000, de Garis noted, \"Just out of curiosity, I asked Kevin Warwick whether he was a Terran or a Cosmist. He said he was against the idea of artilects being built (i.e., he is Terran). I was surprised, and felt a shiver go up my spine.

However, HTTPS signals the browser to use an added encryption layer of SSL/TLS to protect the traffic. SSL/TLS is especially suited for HTTP, since it can provide some protection even if only one side of the communication is [[authentication|authenticated]]. This is the case with HTTP transactions over the Internet, where typically only the [[Web server|server]] is authenticated (by the client examining the server's [[public key certificate|certificate]]).\n\nHTTPS creates a secure channel over an insecure network. This ensures reasonable protection from [[eavesdropping|eavesdroppers]] and [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s, provided that adequate [[cipher suite]]s are used and that the server certificate is verified and trusted.\n\nBecause HTTPS piggybacks HTTP entirely on top of TLS, the entirety of the underlying HTTP protocol can be encrypted. This includes the request URL (which particular web page was requested), query parameters, headers, and cookies (which often contain identity information about the user). However, because host (website) addresses and [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port]] numbers are necessarily part of the underlying [[TCP/IP]] protocols, HTTPS cannot protect their disclosure. In practice this means that even on a correctly configured web server, eavesdroppers can infer the IP address and port number of the web server (sometimes even the domain name e.g. www.example.org, but not the rest of the URL) that one is communicating with, as well as the amount (data transferred) and duration (length of session) of the communication, though not the content of the communication.<ref name=httpse/>\n\nWeb browsers know how to trust HTTPS websites based on [[Certificate authority|certificate authorities]] that come pre-installed in their software. Certificate authorities (such as [[Let's Encrypt]], [[Digicert]], [[Comodo Group|Comodo]], [[GoDaddy]] and [[GlobalSign]]) are in this way being trusted by web browser creators to provide valid certificates. Therefore, a user should trust an HTTPS connection to a website [[if and only if]] all of the following are true:\n\n* The user trusts that the browser software correctly implements HTTPS with correctly pre-installed certificate authorities.\n* The user trusts the certificate authority to vouch only for legitimate websites.\n* The website provides a valid certificate, which means it was signed by a trusted authority.\n* The certificate correctly identifies the website (e.g., when the browser visits \"https://example.com\", the received certificate is properly for \"example.com\" and not some other entity).\n* The user trusts that the protocol's encryption layer (SSL/TLS) is sufficiently secure against eavesdroppers.\n\nHTTPS is especially important over insecure networks (such as public [[Wi-Fi]] access points), as anyone on the same local network can [[Packet analyzer|packet-sniff]] and discover sensitive information not protected by HTTPS. Additionally, many free to use and paid [[Wireless LAN|WLAN]] networks engage in [[packet injection]] in order to serve their own ads on webpages. However, this can be exploited maliciously in many ways, such as injecting [[malware]] onto webpages and stealing users' private information.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hotel Wifi JavaScript Injection |url=https://justinsomnia.org/2012/04/hotel-wifi-javascript-injection/ |date=2012-04-03 |work=JustInsomnia |access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref>\n\nHTTPS is also very important for connections over the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]], as malicious Tor nodes can damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and inject malware into the connection.

[[X.509]] certificates are used to authenticate the server (and sometimes the client as well). As a consequence, [[certificate authority|certificate authorities]] and [[public key certificate]]s are necessary to verify the relation between the certificate and its owner, as well as to generate, sign, and administer the validity of certificates. While this can be more beneficial than verifying the identities via a [[web of trust]], the [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]] drew attention to certificate authorities as a potential weak point allowing [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/03/packet-forensics/ |title=Law Enforcement Appliance Subverts SSL |work=Wired |date=2010-03-24 |first=Ryan |last=Singel |access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/researchers-reveal-likelihood-governments-fake-ssl |title=New Research Suggests That Governments May Fake SSL Certificates |first=Seth |last=Schoen |work=EFF |date=2010-03-24 |access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref> An important property in this context is [[forward secrecy]], which ensures that encrypted communications recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted should long-term secret keys or passwords be compromised in the future.

Also having only a certain page that contains sensitive information (such as a log-in page) of a website loaded over HTTPS, while having the rest of the website loaded over plain HTTP, will expose the user to attacks. On a site that has sensitive information somewhere on it, every time that site is accessed with HTTP instead of HTTPS, the user and the session will get exposed. Similarly, [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] on a site served through HTTPS have to have the [[secure cookie|secure attribute]] enabled.<ref name=deployhttpscorrectly/>\n\n==Technical==\n\n===Difference from HTTP===\nHTTPS [[URL]]s begin with \"https://\" and use [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port]] 443 by default, whereas [[HTTP]] URLs begin with \"http://\" and use port 80 by default.\n\nHTTP is not encrypted and is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks, which can let attackers gain access to website accounts and sensitive information, and modify webpages to inject [[malware]] or advertisements. HTTPS is designed to withstand such attacks and is considered secure against them (with the exception of older, deprecated versions of SSL).\n\n===Network layers===\nHTTP operates at the highest layer of the [[TCP/IP model]], the [[Application layer]]; as does the TLS security protocol (operating as a lower sublayer of the same layer), which encrypts an HTTP message prior to transmission and decrypts a message upon arrival. Strictly speaking, HTTPS is not a separate protocol, but refers to use of ordinary [[HTTP]] over an [[encryption|encrypted]] SSL/TLS connection.\n\nHTTPS encrypts all message contents, including the HTTP headers and the request/response data. With the exception of the possible [[Chosen-ciphertext attack|CCA]] cryptographic attack described in the [[#Limitations|limitations]] section below, an attacker should only be able to discover that a connection is taking place between the two parties and their domain names and IP addresses.\n\n===Server setup===\nTo prepare a web server to accept HTTPS connections, the administrator must create a [[public key certificate]] for the web server. This certificate must be signed by a trusted [[certificate authority]] for the web browser to accept it without warning. The authority certifies that the certificate holder is the operator of the web server that presents it. Web browsers are generally distributed with a list of [[root certificate|signing certificates of major certificate authorities]] so that they can verify certificates signed by them.\n\n====Acquiring certificates====\nA number of commercial [[Certificate authority|certificate authorities]] exist, offering paid-for SSL/TLS certificates of a number of types, including [[Extended Validation Certificate|Extended Validation Certificates]].\n\n[[Let's Encrypt]], launched in April 2016,<ref name=\"softpedia-launch\">{{cite web |url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/let-s-encrypt-launched-today-currently-protects-3-8-million-domains-502857.shtml |title=Let's Encrypt Launched Today, Currently Protects 3.8 Million Domains |publisher=Softpedia News |first=Catalin |last=Cimpanu |date=2016-04-12 |access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref> provides free and automated service that delivers basic SSL/TLS certificates to websites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eweek.com/security/let-s-encrypt-effort-aims-to-improve-internet-security |title=Let's Encrypt Effort Aims to Improve Internet Security |publisher=Quinstreet Enterprise |website=eWeek.com |date=2014-11-18 |access-date=2018-10-20 |last=Kerner |first=Sean Michael}}</ref> According to the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], \"Let's Encrypt\" will make switching from HTTP to HTTPS \"as easy as issuing one command, or clicking one button.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/certificate-authority-encrypt-entire-web |title=Launching in 2015: A Certificate Authority to Encrypt the Entire Web |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=2014-11-18 |access-date=2018-10-20 |last=Eckersley |first=Peter}}</ref> The majority of web hosts and cloud providers now leverage Let's Encrypt, providing free certificates to their customers.\n\n====Use as access control====\nThe system can also be used for client [[authentication]] in order to limit access to a web server to authorized users. To do this, the site administrator typically creates a certificate for each user, a certificate that is loaded into their browser. Normally, that contains the name and e-mail address of the authorized user and is automatically checked by the server on each reconnect to verify the user's identity, potentially without even entering a password.\n\n====In case of compromised secret (private) key====\n{{Update|section|date=August 2018}}\nAn important property in this context is [[perfect forward secrecy]] (PFS). Possessing one of the long-term asymmetric secret keys used to establish an HTTPS session should not make it easier to derive the short-term session key to then decrypt the conversation, even at a later time. [[Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange]] (DHE) and [[Elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] key exchange (ECDHE) are in 2013 the only ones known to have that property. Only 30% of Firefox, Opera, and Chromium Browser sessions use it, and nearly 0% of Apple's [[Safari]] and [[Internet Explorer|Microsoft Internet Explorer]] sessions.<ref name=ecdhe/> Among the larger internet providers, only Google supports PFS {{as of|2011|since=y|lc=y}} (State of September 2013).{{cn|reason=There appears to be reference basis for this claim; Additionally, a cursory test indicates that at least Facebook and Twitter use ECDHE(alexa top 10)|date=September 2013}}\n\nA certificate may be revoked before it expires, for example because the secrecy of the private key has been compromised.

A solution called [[Server Name Indication]] (SNI) exists, which sends the hostname to the server before encrypting the connection, although many old browsers do not support this extension.

If, for any reasons (routing, traffic optimization, etc.), this front machine is not the application server and it has to decipher data, solutions have to be found to propagate user authentication information or certificate to the application server, which needs to know who is going to be connected.\n*For SSL/TLS with mutual authentication, the SSL/TLS session is managed by the first server that initiates the connection. In situations where encryption has to be propagated along chained servers, session timeOut management becomes extremely tricky to implement.\n*With mutual SSL/TLS, security is maximal, but on the client-side, there is no way to properly end the SSL/TLS connection and disconnect the user except by waiting for the server session to expire or closing all related client applications.\n\nA sophisticated type of [[man-in-the-middle attack]] called SSL stripping was presented at the [[Black hat|Blackhat]] Conference 2009.  This type of attack defeats the security provided by HTTPS by changing the <tt>https:</tt> link into an <tt>http:</tt> link, taking advantage of the fact that few Internet users actually type \"https\" into their browser interface: they get to a secure site by clicking on a link, and thus are fooled into thinking that they are using HTTPS when in fact they are using HTTP.  The attacker then communicates in clear with the client.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://moxie.org/software/sslstrip/index.html |title=sslstrip 0.9 |access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref> This prompted the development of a countermeasure in HTTP called [[HTTP Strict Transport Security]].\n\nHTTPS has been shown vulnerable to a range of [[traffic analysis]] attacks.  Traffic analysis attacks are a type of [[side-channel attack]] that relies on variations in the timing and size of traffic in order to infer properties about the encrypted traffic itself. Traffic analysis is possible because SSL/TLS encryption changes the contents of traffic, but has minimal impact on the size and timing of traffic.  In May 2010, a research paper by researchers from [[Microsoft Research]] and [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] discovered that detailed sensitive user data can be inferred from side channels such as packet sizes. More specifically, the researchers found that an eavesdropper can infer the illnesses/medications/surgeries of the user, his/her family income and investment secrets, despite HTTPS protection in several high-profile, top-of-the-line web applications in healthcare, taxation, investment and web search.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/side-channel-leaks-in-web-applications-a-reality-today-a-challenge-tomorrow/ |title=Side-Channel Leaks in Web Applications: a Reality Today, a Challenge Tomorrow |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] Symposium on Security & Privacy 2010 |date=2010-05-20 |author1=Shuo Chen |author2=Rui Wang |author3=XiaoFeng Wang |author4=Kehuan Zhang |access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref> Although this work demonstrated vulnerability of HTTPS to traffic analysis, the approach presented by the authors required manual analysis and focused specifically on web applications protected by HTTPS.\n\nThe fact that most modern websites, including Google, Yahoo!, and Amazon, use HTTPS causes problems for many users trying to access public Wi-Fi hot spots, because a Wi-Fi hot spot login page fails to load if the user tries to open an HTTPS resource.<ref>{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Guaay |url=https://zapier.com/blog/open-wifi-login-page/ |title=How to Force a Public Wi-Fi Network Login Page to Open |date=2017-09-21 |access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://mashtips.com/solve-wifi-login-page-not-loading-issue-ios/ |title=How to Solve WiFi HotSpot Login Page Loading Error on iPhone? |access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref> Several websites, such as [http://neverssl.com/ neverssl.com] or [http://www.nonhttps.com nonhttps.com], guarantee that they will always remain accessible by HTTP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://neverssl.com/ |title=NeverSSL |access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nonhttps.com |title=a non https website |access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Netscape Communications]] created HTTPS in 1994 for its [[Netscape Navigator]] web browser.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLvsis4_QhEC&pg=PA344 |title=Embedded Software: The Works |last=Walls |first=Colin |year=2005 |pages=344 |isbn=0-7506-7954-9 |publisher=Newnes |access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref> Originally, HTTPS was used with the [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] protocol.

During most of its existence, the United Arab Republic was also in a loose [[confederation]] with [[North Yemen]] (formerly the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen) known as the [[United Arab States]].\n\nIn the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israel invaded and occupied Egypt's [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Gaza Strip]], which Egypt had occupied since the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. Three years later (1970), President Nasser died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]].\n\n=== Reign of Sadat ===\n{{Main|Anwar el-Sadat}}\n\nSadat switched Egypt's [[Cold War]] allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972. He launched the [[Infitah]] economic reform policy, while clamping down on religious and secular opposition.\n\nIn 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched the [[Yom Kippur War|October War]], a surprise attack against the Israeli forces occupying the Sinai Peninsula and the [[Golan Heights]]. It was an attempt to regain part of the Sinai territory that Israel had captured six years earlier. Sadat hoped to seize some territory through military force, and then regain the rest of the peninsula by diplomacy. The conflict sparked an international crisis between the US and the USSR, both of whom intervened. The second UN-mandated ceasefire halted military action. While the war ended with a military stalemate, it presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai in return for peace with Israel.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1973 Arab-Israeli War: Arab Policies, Strategies, and Campaigns |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1997/Jordan.htm |author=[[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] Major Michael C.

Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more [[bedroom]]s and [[bathroom]]s, a [[kitchen]] or cooking area, and a [[living room]].

Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called [[townhouse]]s or [[row house]]s may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure.

Some larger properties may also feature rooms such as a spa room, indoor pool, indoor basketball court, and other 'non-essential' facilities. In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, [[List of domesticated animals|domestic animals]] such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) often share part of the house with human beings. Most conventional modern houses will at least contain a [[bedroom]], [[bathroom]], [[kitchen]] or cooking area, and a [[living room]]. A typical \"[[American Foursquare|foursquare]] house\" (as pictured) occurred commonly in the early history of the US where they were mainly built, with a [[staircase]] in the center of the house, surrounded by four rooms, and connected to other sections of the home (including in more recent eras a [[Garage (house)|garage]]).\n\n=== History of the interior ===\n{{further|House plan}}\n[[File:HouseFlrPlan.svg|thumb|[[Floor plan]] of a \"[[American Foursquare|foursquare]]\" house]]\nLittle is known about the earliest origin of the house and its interior, however it can be traced back to the simplest form of shelters. [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] architect [[Vitruvius]]' theories have claimed the first form of [[architecture]] as a frame of timber branches finished in mud, also known as the [[primitive hut]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Jonathan Hill (architect)|Hill, Jonathan]], \u201cImmaterial Architecture\u201d, New York: [[Routledge]], 2006.</ref>\nPhilip Tabor later states the contribution of 17th century Dutch houses as the foundation of houses today.\n:\"As far as the idea of the home is concerned, the home of the home is the [[Netherlands]]. This idea's crystallization might be dated to the first three-quarters of the 17th century, when the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Netherlands amassed the unprecedented and unrivalled accumulation of capital, and emptied their purses into domestic space.<ref>Tabor, Philip, \"Striking Home: The Telematic Assault on Identity\".

Furthermore, the houses accommodated numerous people, including family, relatives, employees, servants and their guests.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Their lifestyles were largely communal, as areas such as the [[Great Hall]] enforced the custom of dining and meetings and the [[Solar (room)|Solar]] intended for shared sleeping beds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/manor-house.htm |title=Manor House |publisher=Middle-ages.org.uk |date=May 16, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Interconnecting rooms ====\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[Italian Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance Palazzo]] consisted of plentiful rooms of connectivity. Unlike the qualities and uses of the Manor Houses, most rooms of the [[palazzo]] contained no purpose, yet were given several [[door]]s. These doors adjoined rooms in which [[Robin Evans]] describes as a \"matrix of discrete but thoroughly interconnected chambers.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Evans, Robin \u201cTranslations from Drawing to Building: Figures, Doors and Passages\u201d London: Architectural Associations Publications 2005</ref> The layout allowed occupants to freely walk room to room from one door to another, thus breaking the boundaries of [[privacy]]. \n:\"Once inside it is necessary to pass from one room to the next, then to the next to traverse the building. Where passages and staircases are used, as inevitably they are, they nearly always connect just one space to another and never serve as general distributors of movement. Thus, despite the precise architectural containment offered by the addition of room upon room, the villa was, in terms of occupation, an open plan, relatively permeable to the numerous members of the household.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nAlthough very public, the open [[House plan|plan]] encouraged sociality and connectivity for all inhabitants.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==== Corridor ====\nAn early example of the segregation of rooms and consequent enhancement of privacy may be found in 1597 at the Beaufort House built in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. It was designed by English [[architect]] [[John Thorpe]] who wrote on his plans, \"A Long Entry through all\".<ref>Summerson, John \u201cThe Book Of Architecture of John Thorpe in Sit John Soan's museum: 40th Volume of the Walpole Society\u201d England: The Society 1964</ref> The separation of the passageway from the room developed the function of the [[Corridor (architecture)|corridor]]. This new extension was revolutionary at the time, allowing the integration of one door per room, in which all universally connected to the same corridor. [[English people|English]] architect [[Sir Roger Pratt]] states \"the common way in the middle through the whole length of the house, [avoids] the offices from one molesting the other by continual passing through them.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Pratt, Sir Roger \u201cSir R. Pratt on Architecture\u201d 1928</ref> [[Social hierarchies]] within the 17th century were highly regarded, as architecture was able to epitomize the servants and the upper class. More privacy is offered to the [[occupant]] as Pratt further claims, \"the ordinary servants may never publicly appear in passing to and fro for their occasions there.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> This social divide between rich and poor favored the physical integration of the corridor into housing by the 19th century.\n\nSociologist [[Witold Rybczynski]] wrote, \"the subdivision of the house into day and night uses, and into formal and informal areas, had begun.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Rybczynski |first=Witold |authorlink=Witold Rybczynski |title=Home: A Short History of An Idea |page=56 |location=London |publisher=Penguin |year=1987 |isbn=0-14-010231-0}}</ref> Rooms were changed from public to private as single entryways forced notions of entering a room with a specific purpose.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==== Employment-free house ====\nCompared to the large scaled houses in England and the Renaissance, the [[Dutch Golden Age|17th Century Dutch]] house was smaller, and was only inhabited by up to four to five members.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This was due to their embracing \"self-reliance\",<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> in contrast to the dependence on servants, and a design for a lifestyle centered on the [[family]]. It was important for the Dutch to separate work from domesticity, as the [[home]] became an escape and a place of [[comfort]]. This way of living and the home has been noted as highly similar to the [[contemporary]] family and their dwellings. House layouts also incorporated the idea of the corridor as well as the importance of function and privacy.\n\nBy the end of the 17th Century, the house layout was soon transformed to become employment-free, enforcing these ideas for the future. This came in favour for the [[industrial revolution]], gaining large-scale factory production and workers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The house layout of the Dutch and its functions are still relevant today.\nThe names of parts of a house often echo the names of parts of other buildings, but could typically include:\n\n{{div col}}\n* [[Alcove (architecture)|Alcove]]\n* [[Atrium (architecture)|Atrium]]\n* [[Attic]]\n* [[Basement]]/[[Basement|cellar]]\n* [[Bathroom]] (in various senses of the word)\n:* [[Bathtub|Bath]]/[[shower]]\n:* [[Toilet]]\n* [[Bedroom]] (or [[Nursery (room)|nursery]], for infants or small children)\n* [[Box-room]] / storage room\n* [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|Conservatory]]\n* [[Dining room]]\n* [[Family room]] or [[den (room)|den]]\n:*[[Fireplace]] (for warmth during winter; generally not found in warmer climates)\n* [[Foyer]]\n* [[Front room]] (in various senses of the phrase)\n* [[Garage (house)|Garage]]\n* [[Hallway]] / [[Hall|passage]] / [[Vestibule (architecture)|Vestibule]]\n* [[Hearth]] \u2013 often an important symbolic focus of family togetherness\n* [[Home-office]] or [[study (room)|study]]\n* [[Kitchen]]\n* [[Larder]]\n* [[Laundry room]]\n* [[Library]]\n* [[Living room]]\n* [[Loft]]\n* [[wikt:nook|Nook]]\n* [[Pantry]]\n* [[Parlour]]\n* [[Pew]]/[[porch]]\n* [[Recreation room]] / [[rumpus room]] / [[television]] room\n* [[Shrine]]s to serve the religious functions associated with a family\n* [[Stairwell]]\n* [[Sunroom]]\n* [[Swimming pool]]\n* [[Window]]\n* [[Workshop]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"110px\">\nFile:Bhutanese Farmhouse Soe Yaksa.jpg|Farmhouse in [[Bhutan]]\nFile:Cambo 169.jpg|Khmer house in [[Cambodia]]\nFile:La caba\u00f1a de Alpina.jpg|Traditional house in [[Colombia]]\nFile:Faza in Kenya's Coast Province.JPEG|Traditional houses in [[Faza]], [[Kenya]]\nFile:Banaue Philippines Batad-Rice-Terraces-03.jpg|Traditional village house in [[Banaue]], [[Philippines]]\nFile:Brgule 006.jpg|House in Brgule, [[Serbia]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Work location, technology and doctors===\n[[File:Doctor's residence and surgery, No 8 Milford Ave, Randwick taken for LJ Hooker Ltd by Sam Hood, 17 July 1951.

The \"deluge of information\",<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> has expressed the efforts of work, conveniently gaining access inside the house. Although commuting is reduced, \"the desire to separate working and living remains apparent.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In [[Jonathan Hill (architect)|Jonathan Hill]]'s book ''Immature Architecture'', he identifies this new invasion of privacy as ''[[Electromagnetism|Electromagnetic]] Weather''. Natural or man-made [[weather]] remains concurrent inside or outside the house, yet the electromagnetic weather is able to generate within both positions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{clarify|date=December 2011}}<!-- garbled syntax --> On the other hand, some architects have designed homes in which eating, working and living are brought together.\n\n== Construction ==\n{{See also|House-building}}\n[[File:HouseStructure.JPG|left|thumb|Some houses are constructed from bricks and wood and are later covered by insulating panels. The roof construction is also seen.]]\n[[File:Houseoltreilcolle.JPG|thumb|right|Two ''baracche''(slum in Italian) near [[Oltre il Colle]], Italy. <br/> These homes are often illegally built and without electricity, proper sanitation and taps for drinking water. ]]\nIn the [[United States]], modern house-construction techniques include [[Framing (construction)|light-frame construction]] (in areas with access to supplies of wood) and [[adobe]] or sometimes [[Rammed earth|rammed-earth construction]] (in arid regions with scarce wood-resources). Some areas use [[brick]] almost exclusively, and quarried [[Rock (geology)|stone]] has long provided walling. To some extent, aluminum and steel have displaced some traditional [[building material]]s. Increasingly popular alternative construction materials include [[insulating concrete form]]s (foam forms filled with [[concrete]]), structural insulated panels (foam panels faced with [[oriented strand board]] or fiber cement), and light-gauge steel framing and heavy-gauge steel framing.\n\nMore generally, people often build houses out of the nearest available material, and often tradition or culture govern construction-materials, so whole towns, areas, counties or even states/countries may be built out of one main type of material. For example, a large fraction of American houses use wood, while most British and many European houses use stone or brick or mud.\n\n[[File:Construction maison bambou.jpg|thumb|Construction of a house using [[bamboo]]. Bamboo-made houses are popular in [[China]], [[Japan]] and other [[Asia]]n countries, because of their resistance to [[earthquakes]] and [[hurricanes]].]] \nIn the 1900s (decade), some house designers started using [[prefabrication]]. [[Sears, Roebuck & Co.]] first marketed their [[Sears Catalog Home]]s to the general public in 1908. Prefab techniques became popular after [[World War II]]. First small inside rooms framing, then later, whole walls were prefabricated and carried to the [[Construction|construction site]]. The original impetus was to use the [[labor force]] inside a shelter during inclement weather. More recently builders have begun to collaborate with structural engineers who use computers and [[finite element analysis]] to design prefabricated [[Steel frame|steel-framed]] homes with known resistance to high wind-loads and [[earthquake|seismic]] forces. These newer products provide labor savings, more consistent quality, and possibly accelerated construction processes.\n\nLesser-used construction methods have gained (or regained) popularity in recent years. Though not in wide use, these methods frequently appeal to homeowners who may become actively involved in the construction process. They include:\n* [[Hempcrete|Cannabrick construction]]\n* [[Cordwood construction]]\n* [[Geodesic dome]]s\n* [[Straw-bale construction]]\n* [[Wattle and daub]]\n* {{vanchor|[[Timber framing]]}}\n* [[Framing (construction)]]\n\n=== Energy efficiency ===\n[[File:Passivhaus thermogram gedaemmt ungedaemmt.png|thumb|Thermographic comparison of traditional (left) and \"[[passivhaus]]\" (right) buildings]]\n[[File:Grachtenstad De Laak.jpg|thumb|Energy-efficient houses in [[Amersfoort]], [[Netherlands]]]]\nIn the developed world, [[energy conservation|energy-conservation]] has grown in importance in house-design.

Steel or [[reinforced concrete]] beams replace the connections to the foundations, while under these, the isolating pads, or ''base isolators'', replace the material removed. While the ''[[base isolation]]'' tends to restrict transmission of the ground motion to the building, it also keeps the building positioned properly over the foundation. Careful attention to detail is required where the building interfaces with the ground, especially at entrances, stairways and ramps, to ensure sufficient [[Kinematics|relative motion]] of those structural elements.\n\n[[Bamboo]] is an earthquake-resistant material, and is very versatile because it comes from fast-grow plants. Adding that bamboos are common in Asia, bamboo-made houses are popular in some Asian countries.\n\n== Found materials ==\n[[File:Xaniy\u00ea Gund\u00ea D\u00eelan.JPG|thumb|left|A traditional [[Kurds|Kurdish]] stone house]]\nIn many parts of the world, houses are constructed using scavenged materials.

When purchasing a new house the buyer has different legal protection than when buying other products. New houses in the UK are covered by a [[National House Building Council]] guarantee.\n\n== Identifying houses ==\nWith the growth of dense settlement, humans designed ways of identifying houses and [[Land lot|parcels]] of land. Individual houses sometimes acquire [[proper name]]s, and those names may acquire in their turn considerable emotional connotations. For example, the house of ''[[Howards End]]'' or the castle of ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]''. A more systematic and general approach to identifying houses may use various methods of [[house numbering]].\n\n== Animal houses ==\n[[File:Vogelhaus Modell Eduard 4.JPG|thumb|right|[[Nest box|Birdhouse]] made to look like a real house]]\nHumans often build houses for domestic or [[Wildlife|wild animals]], often resembling smaller versions of human domiciles. [[Familiar animal]] houses built by humans include [[birdhouse]]s, [[henhouse]]s and [[doghouse]]s, while housed agricultural animals more often live in [[barn]]s and [[stable]]s.\n\n== Houses and symbolism ==\nHouses may express the circumstances or opinions of their builders or their inhabitants. Thus, a vast and elaborate house may serve as a sign of conspicuous wealth whereas a low-profile house built of recycled materials may indicate support of energy conservation.\n\nHouses of particular historical significance (former residences of the famous, for example, or even just very old houses) may gain a protected status in [[town planning]] as examples of built [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] or of streetscape. [[Commemorative plaques]] may mark such structures.\n\n[[Home ownership]] provides a common measure of [[prosperity]] in [[economics]].

As browsers have gained support for hardware-accelerated graphics thanks to the [[canvas element|canvas]] technology (or specifically [[WebGL]] in the case of 3D graphics),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas#Browser_compatibility|title=canvas - HTML|publisher=Mozilla Developer Network|accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API#Browser_compatibility|title=WebGL - Web API Interfaces|publisher=Mozilla Developer Network|accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> as well as [[just-in-time compilation|just-in-time compiled]] JavaScript,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/v8/design?hl=en|title=Design Elements - Chrome V8|accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> the speed difference has become less noticeable.{{citation needed|reason=there is no evidence of the less noticeable speed difference in the previous citations especially with WebGL whereas some unverifiable sources seem to show that it's a lot slower than JOGL: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11087520/jogl-applets-versus-webgl|date=February 2016}}\n\nSince Java bytecode is [[cross-platform]] (or platform independent), Java applets can be executed by browsers (or other [[client (computing)|client]]s) for many platforms, including [[Microsoft Windows]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Unix]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]]. They cannot be run on modern mobile devices, which do not support Java.\n \n== Overview ==\nThe Applets are used to provide interactive features to web applications that cannot be provided by [[HTML]] alone.They can capture [[Mouse (computing)|mouse input]] and also have controls like [[Button (computing)|buttons]] or [[check box]]es. In response to user actions, an applet can change the provided graphic content. This makes applets well-suited for demonstration, visualization, and teaching. There are online applet collections for studying various subjects, from physics to heart physiology.\n\nAn applet can also be a text area only; providing, for instance, a cross-platform [[command-line interface]] to some remote system. If needed, an applet can leave the dedicated area and run as a separate window. However, applets have very little control over web page content outside the applet's dedicated area, so they are less useful for improving the site appearance in general, unlike other types of [[browser extension]]s (while applets like [[news ticker]]s or [[WYSIWYG]] editors are also known). Applets can also play media in formats that are not natively supported by the browser.\n\nPages coded in HTML may embed parameters within them that are passed to the applet. Because of this, the same applet may have a different appearance depending on the parameters that were passed.\n\nAs applets were available before [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[DHTML]] were standard, they were also widely used for trivial effects such as [[rollover (web design)|rollover]] navigation buttons. This approach, which posed major problems for accessibility and misused system resources, is no longer in use and was strongly discouraged even at the time.\n\n== Technical information ==\nJava applets are executed in a ''[[sandbox (security)|sandbox]]'' by most web browsers, preventing them from accessing local data like the [[clipboard (software)|clipboard]] or [[file system]]. The code of the applet is downloaded from a [[web server]], after which the browser either [[compound document|embeds]] the applet into a web page or opens a new window showing the applet's [[user interface]].\n\nA Java applet extends the class {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.applet|java/applet|Applet}}, or in the case of a [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] applet, {{Javadoc:SE|package=javax.swing|javax/swing|JApplet}}. The class which must override methods from the applet class to set up a user interface inside itself (<code>Applet</code>) is a descendant of {{Javadoc:SE|java/awt|Panel}} which is a descendant of {{Javadoc:SE|java/awt|Container}}. As applet inherits from container, it has largely the same user interface possibilities as an ordinary Java application, including regions with user specific visualization. <!-- I feel like there is something wrong here, as I'm not sure what it's trying to say. Maybe someone with more programming knowledge than myself can clarify here. -->\n\nThe first implementations involved downloading an applet class by class. While classes are small files, there are often many of them, so applets got a reputation as slow-loading components. However, since [[JAR (file format)|.jar]]s were introduced, an applet is usually delivered as a single file that has a size similar to an image file (hundreds of kilobytes to several megabytes).\n\nThe [[Domain Name System|domain]] from where the applet executable has been downloaded is the only domain to which the usual (unsigned) applet is allowed to communicate. This domain can be different from the domain where the surrounding HTML document is hosted.\n\nJava [[Static library|system libraries]] and [[Runtime library|runtimes]] are backwards-compatible, allowing one to write code that runs both on current and on future versions of the Java virtual machine.\n\n=== Similar technologies ===\nMany Java developers, blogs and magazines are recommending that the [[Java Web Start]] technology be used in place of applets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-07-2001/jw-0706-webstart.html|title=JavaWorld.com|date=6 July 2001|work=JavaWorld}}</ref> Java Web Start allows the launching of unmodified applet code, which then runs in a separate window (not inside the invoking browser).\n\nA [[Java Servlet]] is sometimes informally compared to be \"like\" a server-side applet, but it is different in its language, functions, and in each of the characteristics described here about applets.\n\n== Embedding into a web page ==\nThe applet can be displayed on the web page by making use of the deprecated <code>[[Img (HTML element)|applet]]</code> HTML element,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#edef-APPLET|title=W3.org|publisher=}}</ref> or the recommended <code>object</code> element.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#edef-OBJECT|title=W3.org|publisher=}}</ref> The <code>embed</code> element can be used<ref name=\"java\">{{cite web|url=http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp |title=Java Downloads for All Operating Systems |publisher=Java.com |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> with Mozilla family browsers (<code>embed</code> was deprecated in HTML 4 but is included in HTML 5). This specifies the applet's source and location. Both <code>object</code> and <code>embed</code> tags can also download and install Java virtual machine (if required) or at least lead to the plugin page. <code>applet</code> and <code>object</code> tags also support loading of the serialized applets that start in some particular (rather than initial) state. Tags also specify the message that shows up in place of the applet if the browser cannot run it due to any reason.\n\nHowever, despite <code>object</code> being officially a recommended tag, as of 2010, the support of the <code>object</code> tag was not yet consistent among browsers and Sun kept recommending the older <code>applet</code> tag for deploying in multibrowser environments,<ref name=\"ja\">[http://download.java.net/jdk7/docs/technotes/guides/plugin/developer_guide/using_tags.html#object Sun's position on applet and object tags]</ref> as it remained the only tag consistently supported by the most popular browsers. To support multiple browsers, the <code>object</code> tag currently requires JavaScript (that recognizes the browser and adjusts the tag), usage of additional browser-specific tags or delivering adapted output from the server side. Deprecating <code>applet</code> tag has been criticized. Oracle now provides a maintained JavaScript code<ref>[http://www.java.com/java/deployJava.txt Java applet launcher from Oracle - Link Broken!]</ref> to launch applets with cross platform workarounds.\n\nThe Java browser plug-in relies on [[NPAPI]], which many web browser vendors are deprecating due to its age and security issues. In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java runtime environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser plug-in.<ref name=\"ars-nopluginjdk9\">{{cite web|title=Oracle deprecates the Java browser plugin, prepares for its demise|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/01/oracle-deprecates-the-java-browser-plugin-prepares-for-its-demise/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Example ==\nThe following example illustrates the use of Java applets through the java.applet package. The example also uses classes from the Java [[Abstract Window Toolkit]] (AWT) to produce the message \"[[Hello world program|Hello, world!]]\" as output.\n\n<source lang=\"java\">\nimport java.applet.*;\nimport java.awt.*;\n\n// Applet code for the \"Hello, world!\" example.\n// This should be saved in a file named as \"HelloWorld.java\".\npublic class HelloWorld extends Applet {\n    // Print a message on the screen (x = 20, y = 10).\n    public void paint(Graphics g) {\n        g.drawString(\"Hello, world!\", 20, 10);\n\n        // Draws a circle on the screen (x = 40, y = 30).\n        g.drawArc(40, 30, 20, 20, 0, 360);\n\n        // Draws a rectangle on the screen (x1 = 100, y1 = 100, x2 = 300, y2 = 300).\n        g.drawRect(100, 100, 300, 300);\n\n        // Draws a square on the screen (x1 = 100, y1 = 100, x2 = 200, y2 = 200).\n        g.drawRect(100, 100, 200, 200);\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\nSimple applets are shared freely on the Internet for customizing applications that support [[plugin (computing)|plugin]]s.\n\nAfter [[compiler|compilation]], the resulting <tt>.class</tt> file can be placed on a web server and invoked within an [[HTML]] page by using an <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</tt> or an <tt>&lt;object&gt;</tt> tag. For example:\n\n<source lang=\"html5\">\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>HelloWorld_example.html</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h1>A Java applet example</h1>\n  <p>\n    Here it is:\n    <applet code=\"HelloWorld.class\" height=\"40\" width=\"200\">\n      This is where HelloWorld.class runs.\n    </applet>\n  </p>\n</body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nWhen the page is accessed it will read as follows:\n\n::<span style=\"font-size:1.9em;\">'''A Java applet example'''</span>\n::Here it is: Hello, world!\n\nTo minimize download time, applets can be delivered in the form of a [[JAR (file format)|jar]] file. In the case of this example, if all necessary classes are placed in the compressed archive ''example.jar'', the following embedding code could be used instead:\n\n<source lang=\"html5\">\n<p>\n  Here it is:\n  <applet archive=\"example.jar\" code=\"HelloWorld\" height=\"40\" width=\"200\">\n    This is where HelloWorld.class runs.\n  </applet>\n</p>\n</source>\n\nApplet inclusion is described in detail in Sun's official page about the APPLET tag.<ref name=\"appletinclusion\">[http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/misc/applet.html Java.Sun.com] Sun's APPLET tag page {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105041516/http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/misc/applet.html |date=5 January 2010 }}</ref>\n\n== Advantages ==\nA Java applet can have any or all of the following advantages:<ref>[http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/index.html Oracle official] overview on Java applet technology</ref>\n\n* It is simple to make it work on FreeBSD, Linux, Microsoft Windows and macOS{{snd}} that is, to make it cross platform. Applets were supported by most [[web browser]]s through the first decade of the 21st century; since then, however, most browsers have dropped applet support for security reasons.\n* The same applet can work on \"all\" installed versions of Java at the same time, rather than just the latest [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] version only.  However, if an applet requires a later version of the [[Java Virtual Machine|Java Runtime Environment]] (JRE) the client will be forced to wait during the large download.\n* Most web browsers [[web cache|cache]] applets so they will be quick to load when returning to a web page. Applets also improve with use: after a first applet is run, the JVM is already running and starts quickly (the JVM will need to restart each time the browser starts afresh). It should be noted that JRE versions 1.5 and greater stop the JVM and restart it when the browser navigates from one HTML page containing an applet to another containing an applet.\n* It can move the work from the [[server (computing)|server]] to the [[client (computing)|client]], making a web solution more scalable with the number of users/clients.\n* If a standalone program (like [[Google Earth]]) talks to a web server, that server normally needs to support all prior versions for users which have not kept their client software updated. In contrast, a properly configured browser loads (and caches) the latest applet version, so there is no need to support legacy versions.\n* The applet naturally supports the changing user state, such as figure positions on the chessboard.\n* Developers can develop and debug an applet directly simply by creating a main routine (either in the applet's class or in a separate class) and calling init() and start() on the applet, thus allowing for development in their favorite [[Java Platform, Standard Edition|Java SE]] development environment. All one has to do after that is re-test the applet in the AppletViewer program or a web browser to ensure it conforms to security restrictions.\n* An [[Browser security|untrusted]] applet has no access to the local machine and can only access the server it came from. This makes such an applet much safer to run than a standalone executable that it could replace. However, a signed applet can have full access to the machine it is running on if the user agrees.\n* Java applets are fast\u2014and can even have [[Java performance|similar performance]] to native installed software.\n\n== Disadvantages ==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}\nA Java applet may have any of the following disadvantages compared to other client-side web technologies:\n\n* Java applets depend on a Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is a reasonably complex and heavy-weight software package.  It also normally requires a [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] for the web browser. Some organizations only allow software installed by an administrator. As a result, some users can only view applets that are important enough to justify contacting the administrator to request installation of the JRE and plug-in.\n* If an applet requires a newer JRE than available on the system, or a specific JRE, the user running it the first time will need to wait for the large JRE download to complete.\n* Mobile browsers on [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]], do not run Java applets at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_mobile.xml|title=How do I get Java for Mobile device?|date=30 July 2014|publisher=}}</ref> As previously noted, desktop browsers have phased out Java applet support concurrently with the rise of mobile operating systems.\n* Unlike the older <code>applet</code> tag, the <code>object</code> tag needs workarounds to write a cross-browser HTML document.\n* There is no standard to make the content of applets available to screen readers. Therefore, applets can harm the accessibility of a web site to users with special needs.\n* As with any client-side scripting, security restrictions may make it difficult or even impossible for an untrusted applet to achieve the desired goals. However, simply editing the java.policy file in the JAVA JRE installation, one can grant access to the local filesystem or system clipboard for example, or to other network sources other than the network source that served the applet to the browser.\n\n== Compatibility-related lawsuits ==\n[[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] has made considerable efforts to ensure compatibility is maintained between Java versions as they evolve, enforcing Java portability by law if required. Oracle seems to be continuing the same strategy.\n\n=== 1997: Sun vs Microsoft ===\nThe 1997 lawsuit,<ref name=\"s1997\">{{cite web|url=http://www.javaworld.com/jw-10-1997/jw-10-lawsuit.html|title=What does Sun's lawsuit against Microsoft mean for Java developers? |first=John |last=Zukowski |date=1 October 1997|work=JavaWorld}}</ref> was filed after Microsoft created a modified [[Microsoft Java Virtual Machine|Java Virtual Machine of their own]], which shipped with Internet Explorer. Microsoft added about 50 methods and 50 fields<ref name=\"s1997\"/> into the classes within the ''java.awt, java.lang'', and ''java.io'' packages. Other modifications included removal of [[Java remote method invocation|RMI]] capability and replacement of [[Java native interface]] from JNI to [[Java Native Interface#Microsoft's RNI|RNI]], a different standard. RMI was removed because it only easily supports Java to Java communications and competes with Microsoft [[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] technology. Applets that relied on these changes or just inadvertently used them worked only within Microsoft's Java system. Sun sued for breach of [[trademark]], as the point of Java was that there should be no proprietary extensions and that code should work everywhere. Microsoft agreed to pay Sun $20 million, and Sun agreed to grant Microsoft limited license to use Java without modifications only and for a limited time.<ref name=\"sun_suits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/lawsuit/summary.html|title=Sun's page, devoted for the lawsuits against Microsoft|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== 2002: Sun vs Microsoft ===\nMicrosoft continued to ship its own unmodified Java virtual machine. Over the years it became extremely outdated yet still default for Internet Explorer. A later study revealed that applets of this time often contain their own classes that mirror [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] and other newer features in a limited way.<ref>[http://kenai.com/projects/ultrastudio-org/forums/message-forum/topics/7034-Most-common-problems-found-in-the-code-of-the-reviewed-applets Kenai.com (2011)] Most common problems, found in the code of the reviewed applets.</ref>  In 2002, Sun filed an [[antitrust]] lawsuit, claiming that Microsoft's attempts at illegal monopolization had harmed the Java platform. Sun demanded Microsoft distribute Sun's current, binary implementation of Java technology as part of Windows, distribute it as a recommended update for older Microsoft desktop operating systems and stop the distribution of Microsoft's Virtual Machine (as its licensing time, agreed in the prior lawsuit, had expired).<ref name=\"sun_suits\"/> Microsoft paid $700 million for pending antitrust issues, another $900 million for patent issues and a $350 million royalty fee to use Sun's software in the future.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/apr04/04-02SunAgreementPR.mspx Microsoft page devoted to the Sun - Microsoft 2002 lawsuit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225015449/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/apr04/04-02SunAgreementPR.mspx |date=25 February 2010 }}</ref>{{primary inline|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== 2010: Oracle vs Google ===\n{{See also|Oracle v. Google}}\nGoogle has developed its own [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform that uses Java features and concepts, yet is incompatible with standard libraries. This may be a violation of conditions under which Sun granted [[OpenJDK]] patents to use open source Java for all. In 2010, Oracle sued Google<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/08/12/oracle-sues-google-over-android/|title=Oracle sues Google over Android|work=VentureBeat}}</ref> for using Java \"in a wrong way\", claiming that \"Google's Android competes with Oracle America's Java\" and that \"Google has been aware of Sun\u2019s patent portfolio ... since Google hired certain former Sun Java engineers\". In May 2012, the jury in this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents, and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/jury-clears-google-of-infringing-on-oracle-patents/77897 | title=Jury clears Google of infringing on Oracle's patents | author = Josh Lowensohn | work=ZDNet | date = 23 May 2012 | accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web \n| title = Google wins crucial API ruling, Oracle\u2019s case decimated\n| url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/05/google-wins-crucial-api-ruling-oracles-case-decimated/ \n| author = Joe Mullin\n| work =  Ars Technica \n| date = 31 May 2012\n| accessdate = 2012-06-01 \n }}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\nThere are two applet types with very different security models: signed applets and unsigned applets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/deployment/applet/security.html|title=Sun's explanation about applet security|publisher=}}</ref> As of Java SE 7 Update 21 (April 2013) applets and Web-Start Apps are encouraged to be signed with a trusted certificate, and warning messages appear when running unsigned applets.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/java-code-signing-1915323.html#60|title = Java Applet & Web Start - Code Signing|accessdate = 28 February 2014|publisher = Oracle}}</ref> Further starting with Java 7 Update 51 unsigned applets are blocked by default; they can be run by creating an exception in the Java Control Panel.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://java.com/en/download/help/appsecuritydialogs.xml|title = What should I do when I see a security prompt from Java?|accessdate = 28 February 2014|date = |publisher = Oracle}}</ref>\n\n=== Unsigned ===\nLimits on unsigned applets are understood as \"draconian\": they have no access to the local filesystem and web access limited to the applet download site; there are also many other important restrictions. For instance, they cannot access all system properties, use their own [[class loader]], call [[native code]], execute external commands on a local system or redefine classes belonging to core packages included as part of a Java release. While they can run in a standalone frame, such frame contains a header, indicating that this is an untrusted applet. Successful initial call of the forbidden method does not automatically create a security hole as an access controller checks the entire [[Call stack|stack]] of the calling code to be sure the call is not coming from an improper location.\n\nAs with any complex system, many security problems have been discovered and fixed since Java was first released. Some of these (like the Calendar serialization security bug) persisted for many years with nobody being aware. Others have been discovered in use by malware in the wild.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nSome studies mention applets crashing the browser or overusing [[central processing unit|CPU]] resources but these are classified as nuisances and not as true security flaws. However, unsigned applets may be involved in combined attacks that exploit a combination of multiple severe configuration errors in other parts of the system. An unsigned applet can also be more dangerous to run directly on the server where it is hosted because while code base allows it to talk with the server, running inside it can bypass the firewall. An applet may also try [[Denial-of-service attack|DoS attacks]] on the server where it is hosted, but usually people who manage the web site also manage the applet, making this unreasonable. Communities may solve this problem via [[Code review|source code review]] or running applets on a dedicated domain.\n\nThe unsigned applet can also try to download malware hosted on originating server. However it could only store such file into a temporary folder (as it is transient data) and has no means to complete the attack by executing it. There were attempts to use applets for spreading Phoenix and Siberia exploits this way,{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} but these exploits do not use Java internally and were also distributed in several other ways.\n\n=== Signed ===\nA signed applet<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=433382&seqNum=2|title=Informit.com|publisher=}}</ref> contains a signature that the browser should verify through a remotely running, independent [[Certificate server|certificate authority server]]. Producing this signature involves specialized tools and interaction with the authority server maintainers. Once the signature is verified, and the user of the current machine also approves, a signed applet can get more rights, becoming equivalent to an ordinary standalone program. The rationale is that the author of the applet is now known and will be responsible for any deliberate damage.{{vague|date=October 2010}} This approach allows applets to be used for many tasks that are otherwise not possible by client-side scripting. However, this approach requires more responsibility from the user, deciding whom he or she trusts. The related concerns include a non-responsive authority server, wrong evaluation of the signer identity when issuing certificates, and known applet publishers still doing something that the user would not approve of. Hence signed applets that appeared from Java 1.1 may actually have more security concerns.\n\n=== Self-signed ===\nSelf-signed applets, which are applets signed by the developer themselves, may potentially pose a security risk; java plugins provide a warning when requesting authorization for a self-signed applet, as the function and safety of the applet is guaranteed only by the developer itself, and has not been independently confirmed. Such self-signed certificates are usually only used during development prior to release where third-party confirmation of security is unimportant, but most applet developers will seek third-party signing to ensure that users trust the applet's safety.\n\nJava security problems are not fundamentally different from similar problems of any client-side scripting platform<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/legacy/compbooks/press/mcgch1.html|title=To be fair, significantly more World Wide Web users use the Netscape product than use the Microsoft product today, though the gap appears to be closing|last=|first=|date=|website=www.wiley.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-17}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. In particular, all issues related to signed applets also apply to Microsoft [[ActiveX]] components.\n\nAs of 2014, self-signed and unsigned applets are no longer accepted by the commonly available Java plugins or Java Web Start. Consequently, developers who wish to deploy Java applets have no alternative but to acquire trusted certificates from commercial sources.\n\n== Alternatives ==\nAlternative technologies exist (for example, [[JavaScript]]) that satisfy all or more of the scope of what is possible with an applet.

At that time there were farms, [[market garden]]s and [[orchard]]s there: there was a \"Heathrow Farm\" about where Terminal 1 is now, a \"Heathrow Hall\" and a \"Heathrow House\". This hamlet was largely along a country lane (Heathrow Road) which ran roughly along the east and south edges of the present central terminals area.\n\nDevelopment of the whole Heathrow area as a very much larger airport began in 1944: it was stated to be for long-distance military aircraft bound for the Far East. But by the time the airfield was nearing completion, [[World War II]] had ended. The government continued to develop the airport as a civil airport. The airport was opened on 25 March 1946 as '''London Airport''' and was renamed Heathrow Airport in 1966. The masterplan{{clarify|date=January 2017}} for the airport was designed by [[Sir Frederick Gibberd]], who designed the original terminals and central area buildings, including the original control tower and the multi-faith chapel of St George's.\n\n==Operations==\n===Facilities===\n[[File:TerminalFiveAirportHeathrowAugust2012.JPG|thumb|Central waiting area in [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5]]]]\n[[File:concorde g-boab in storage arp.jpg|thumb|[[Concorde]] G-BOAB in storage at Heathrow]]\n[[File:Four aircraft on the approach to LHR runway 09L 10Sep2015 arp.jpg|thumb|Four aircraft on the approach to Heathrow runway 09L]]\n[[File:London Heathrow tower and Virgin B747 (5048342074) (2).jpg|thumb|Heathrow's control tower]]\n[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5C Iwelumo-1.jpg|thumb|British Airways aircraft at [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5C]]]]\nHeathrow Airport is used by over 80 airlines flying to 185 destinations in 84 countries. The airport is the primary [[Airline hub|hub]] of British Airways and is a base for [[Virgin Atlantic]]. It has four passenger terminals (numbered 2 to 5) and a cargo terminal. Of Heathrow's 73.4&nbsp;million passengers in 2014, 93% were international travellers; the remaining 7% were bound for (or arriving from) places in the UK.<ref name=Facts>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information/facts-and-figures|title=Facts and figures|publisher=Heathrow Airport|accessdate=12 February 2015}}</ref> The busiest single destination in passenger numbers is New York, with over 3&nbsp;million passengers flying between Heathrow and JFK Airport in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf|title=International Air Passenger Traffic To and From Reporting Airports for 2013|page=68|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority|accessdate=12 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704161033/https://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf|archivedate=4 July 2015|deadurl=yes}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, Heathrow had six runways, arranged in three pairs at different angles in the shape of a [[hexagram]] with the permanent passenger terminal in the middle and the older terminal along the north edge of the field; two of its runways would always be within 30\u00b0 of the wind direction. As the required length for runways has grown, Heathrow now has only two parallel runways running east\u2013west. These are extended versions of the two east\u2013west runways from the original hexagram. From the air, almost all of the original runways can still be seen, incorporated into the present system of taxiways. North of the northern runway and the former taxiway and aprons, now the site of extensive car parks, is the entrance to the access tunnel and the site of Heathrow's unofficial \"[[gate guardian]]\". For many years the home of a 40% scale model of a British Airways [[Concorde]], G-CONC, the site has been occupied by a model of an Emirates [[Airbus A380]] since 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=Heathrow Concorde model removed|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6509667.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=30 March 2007|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nHeathrow Airport has [[Church of England|Anglican]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Nonconformist|Free Church]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Jewish]], [[Muslim]] and [[Sikhism|Sikh]] chaplains.

Heathrow's two runways generally operate in segregated mode, whereby arriving aircraft are allocated to one runway and departing aircraft to the other. To further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes, the use of runways 27R and 27L is swapped at 15:00 each day if the wind is from the west. When landings are easterly there is no alternation; 09L remains the landing runway and 09R the departure runway due to the legacy of the now rescinded [[Cranford Agreement]], pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed. Occasionally, landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway, to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal, reducing taxi times.\n\nNight-time flights at Heathrow are subject to [[Night flying restrictions|restrictions]]. Between 23:00 and 04:00, the noisiest aircraft (rated [[Quota Count system|QC]]/8 and QC/16) cannot be scheduled for operation. In addition, during the night quota period (23:30\u201306:00) there are four limits:\n*A limit on the number of flights allowed;\n*A [[Quota Count system]] which limits the total amount of noise permitted, but allows operators to choose to operate fewer noisy aircraft or a greater number of quieter planes;<ref name=\"Ref_p\">{{cite web|title=Noise limits|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/noise/what-we-do-about-it/measures-already-in-place/noise-limits|publisher=Heathrow Airport|accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref>\n*QC/4 aircraft cannot be scheduled for operation.\n*A voluntary agreement with the airlines that no early morning arrivals will be scheduled to land before 04:30.\n\nA trial of \"noise relief zones\" ran from December 2012 to March 2013, which concentrated approach flight paths into defined areas compared with the existing paths which were spread out. The zones used alternated weekly, meaning residents in the \"no-fly\" areas received respite from aircraft noise for set periods.<ref>{{cite news|title=Heathrow begins trial of noise relief zones|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20591037|publisher=BBC News|date=4 December 2012|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref> However, it was concluded that some residents in other areas experienced a significant disbenefit as a result of the trial and that it should therefore not be taken forward in its current form.

In 1991, PAA and TWA sold their rights to [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] respectively, while Virgin Atlantic was added to the list of airlines allowed to operate on these routes. The Bermuda bilateral agreement conflicted with the Right of Establishment of the United Kingdom in relation to its EU membership, and as a consequence the UK was ordered to drop the agreement in 2004. A new \"[[EU\u2013US Open Skies Agreement|open skies]]\" agreement was signed by the United States and the [[European Union]] on 30 April 2007 and came into effect on 30 March 2008.

He was the first whose quantitative and accurate models for the motion of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] survive. For this he certainly made use of the observations and perhaps the mathematical techniques accumulated over centuries by the [[Babylonia]]ns and by [[Meton of Athens]] (5th century {{sc|bc}}), [[Timocharis]], [[Aristyllus]], [[Aristarchus of Samos]] and [[Eratosthenes]], among others.<ref name=\"jones\">{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Alexander Raymond |title=Hipparchus |date=2017 |publisher=Encyclopedia Brittanica, Inc. |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hipparchus-Greek-astronomer |accessdate=25 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806143034/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hipparchus-Greek-astronomer |archivedate=6 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He developed trigonometry and constructed trigonometric tables, and he solved several problems of [[spherical trigonometry]]. With his solar and [[lunar theory|lunar]] theories and his trigonometry, he may have been the first to develop a reliable method to predict [[solar eclipse]]s. His other reputed achievements include the discovery and measurement of Earth's precession, the compilation of the first comprehensive [[star catalog]] of the western world, and possibly the invention of the [[astrolabe]], also of the [[armillary sphere]], which he used during the creation of much of the star catalogue.\n\n==Life and work==\nRelatively little of Hipparchus's direct work survives into modern times. Although he wrote at least fourteen books, only his commentary on the popular astronomical poem by [[Aratus]] was preserved by later copyists. Most of what is known about Hipparchus comes from [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica|Geography]]'' and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' in the 1st century; [[Ptolemy]]'s 2nd-century ''[[Almagest]]''; and additional references to him in the 4th century by [[Pappus of Alexandria]] and [[Theon of Alexandria]] in their commentaries on the ''Almagest''.<ref>For general information on Hipparchus see the following biographical articles: [[G. J. Toomer]], \"Hipparchus\" (1978); and A. Jones, \"Hipparchus.\"</ref>\n\nThere is a strong tradition that Hipparchus was born in Nicaea (Greek ''\u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1''), in the ancient district of [[Bithynia]] (modern-day Iznik in province [[Bursa Province|Bursa]]), in what today is the country [[Turkey]].\n\nThe exact dates of his life are not known, but Ptolemy attributes to him astronomical observations in the period from 147\u2013127&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, and some of these are stated as made in Rhodes; earlier observations since 162&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} might also have been made by him. His birth date ({{c.|lk=no|190}}&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}) was calculated by [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]] based on clues in his work. Hipparchus must have lived some time after 127&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} because he analyzed and published his observations from that year. Hipparchus obtained information from [[Alexandria]] as well as [[Babylon]], but it is not known when or if he visited these places. He is believed to have died on the island of [[Rhodes]], where he seems to have spent most of his later life.\n\nIt is not known what Hipparchus's economic means were nor how he supported his scientific activities. His appearance is likewise unknown: there are no contemporary portraits. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries [[coin]]s were made in his honour in [[Bithynia]] that bear his name and show him with a [[globe]]; this supports the tradition that he was born there.\n\nHipparchus is thought to be the first to calculate a heliocentric system,<ref>{{cite web|title=Hipparchus of Nicea|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Hipparchus_of_Nicea/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605021909/http://www.ancient.eu/Hipparchus_of_Nicea/|archivedate=5 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> but he abandoned his work because the calculations showed the orbits were not perfectly circular as believed to be mandatory by the science of the time. As an astronomer of antiquity, his influence, supported by ideas from Aristotle, held sway for nearly 2000 years, until the [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric model of Copernicus]].\n\nHipparchus's only preserved work is ''\u03a4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f08\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u0395\u1f50\u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03be\u03ae\u03b3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2'' (\"Commentary on the Phaenomena of Eudoxus and Aratus\"). This is a highly critical commentary in the form of two books on a popular [[poem]] by [[Aratus]] based on the work by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]].<ref>Modern edition: [[Karl Manitius]] (''In Arati et Eudoxi Phaenomena'', Leipzig, 1894).</ref> Hipparchus also made a list of his major works, which apparently mentioned about fourteen books, but which is only known from references by later authors. His famous star catalog was incorporated into the one by Ptolemy, and may be almost perfectly reconstructed by subtraction of two and two thirds degrees from the longitudes of Ptolemy's stars. The first trigonometric table was apparently compiled by Hipparchus, who is now consequently known as \"the father of trigonometry\".\n\n===Modern speculation===\nHipparchus was in the international news in 2005, when it was again proposed (as in 1898) that the data on the [[celestial globe]] of Hipparchus or in his star catalog may have been preserved in the only surviving large ancient celestial globe which depicts the constellations with moderate accuracy, the globe carried by the [[Farnese Atlas]].

Hipparchus seems to have been the first to exploit Babylonian astronomical knowledge and techniques systematically.<ref>For more information see [[G. J. Toomer]], \"Hipparchus and Babylonian astronomy.\"</ref> Except for [[Timocharis]] and [[Aristillus]], he was the first Greek known to divide the circle in 360 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] of 60 [[arc minute]]s ([[Eratosthenes]] before him used a simpler [[sexagesimal]] system dividing a circle into 60 parts). He also used the Babylonian unit ''pechus'' (\"cubit\") of about 2\u00b0 or 2.5\u00b0.\n\nHipparchus probably compiled a list of Babylonian astronomical observations; [[G. J. Toomer]], a historian of astronomy, has suggested that Ptolemy's knowledge of eclipse records and other Babylonian observations in the ''Almagest'' came from a list made by Hipparchus. Hipparchus's use of Babylonian sources has always been known in a general way, because of Ptolemy's statements. However, [[Franz Xaver Kugler]] demonstrated that the synodic and anomalistic periods that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus had already been used in Babylonian [[ephemerides]], specifically the collection of texts nowadays called \"System B\" (sometimes attributed to [[Kidinnu]]).<ref>Franz Xaver Kugler, ''Die Babylonische Mondrechnung'' (\"The Babylonian lunar computation\"), Freiburg im Breisgau, 1900.</ref>\n\nHipparchus's long [[orbital period|draconitic]] lunar period (5,458 months = 5,923 lunar nodal periods) also appears a few times in [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian records]].<ref>{{citation|first=Asger|last=Aaboe|authorlink=Asger Aaboe|title=On the Babylonian origin of some Hipparchian parameters|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1955.tb00619.x|journal=Centaurus|volume=4|issue=2|pages=122\u2013125|year=1955|bibcode = 1955Cent....4..122A }}. On p. 124, Aaboe identifies the Hipparchian equation 5458 syn. mo. = 5923 drac. mo. with the equation of 1,30,58 syn. mo. = 1,38,43 drac. mo. (written in [[sexagesimal]]) which he cites to p. 73. of Neugebauer's ''Astronomical Cuneiform Texts'', London 1955.</ref> But the only such tablet explicitly dated is post-Hipparchus so the direction of transmission is not settled by the tablets.\n\nHipparchus's draconitic lunar motion cannot be solved by the lunar-four arguments that are sometimes proposed to explain his anomalistic motion. A solution that has produced the exact 5,458/5,923 ratio is rejected by most historians though it uses the only anciently attested method of determining such ratios, and it automatically delivers the ratio's four-digit numerator and denominator. Hipparchus initially used (''Almagest'' 6.9) his 141 BC eclipse with a Babylonian eclipse of 720 BC to find the less accurate ratio 7160 synodic months = 7,770 draconitic months, simplified by him to 716 = 777 through division by 10. (He similarly found from the 345-year cycle the ratio 4267 synodic months = 4573 anomalistic months and divided by 17 to obtain the standard ratio 251 synodic months = 269 anomalistic months.) If he sought a longer time base for this draconitic investigation he could use his same 141 BC eclipse with a moonrise 1245 BC eclipse from Babylon, an interval of 13,645 synodic months = 14,8807 1/2 draconitic months \u2248 14,623 1/2 anomalistic months. Dividing by 5/2 produces 5458 synodic months = 5923 precisely.<ref>Pro & con arguments are given at [http://www.dioi.org/vols/wb1.pdf ''DIO'' volume 11 number 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426141646/http://www.dioi.org/vols/wb1.pdf |date=26 April 2015 }} article 3 sections C & D.</ref> The obvious main objection is that the early eclipse is unattested though that is not surprising in itself and there is no consensus on whether Babylonian observations were recorded this remotely. Though Hipparchus's tables formally went back only to 747 BC, 600 years before his era, the tables were actually good back to before the eclipse in question because as only recently noted<ref>See [http://www.dioi.org/thr.htm#bvmr demonstration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105220/http://www.dioi.org/thr.htm |date=2 April 2015 }} of reverse use of Hipparchus's table for the 1245 BCE eclipse.</ref> their use in reverse is no more difficult than forwards.\n\n==Geometry, trigonometry, and other mathematical techniques==\nHipparchus was recognized as the first mathematician known to have possessed a [[trigonometric table]], which he needed when computing the [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] of the [[orbit]]s of the Moon and Sun. He tabulated values for the [[chord (geometry)|chord]] function, which gives the length of the chord for each angle. He did this for a circle with a circumference of 21,600 and a radius (rounded) of 3438 units: this circle has a unit length of 1 arc minute along its perimeter. He tabulated the chords for angles with increments of 7.5\u00b0. In modern terms, the chord of an angle equals the radius times twice the [[trigonometric function|sine]] of half of the angle, i.e.:\n\n:chord(''A'') = r(2&nbsp;sin(''A''/2)).\n\nHe described the chord table in a work, now lost, called ''T\u014dn en kukl\u014d<sub>i</sub> euthei\u014dn'' (''Of Lines Inside a Circle'') by [[Theon of Alexandria]] in his 4th-century commentary on the ''Almagest'' I.10; some claim his table may have survived in astronomical treatises in India, for instance the ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]''. Trigonometry was a significant innovation, because it allowed Greek astronomers to solve any triangle, and made it possible to make quantitative astronomical models and predictions using their preferred geometric techniques.<ref>Toomer, \"The Chord Table of Hipparchus\" (1973).</ref>\n\nFor his chord table Hipparchus must have used a better approximation for [[pi|\u03c0]] than the one from [[Archimedes]] of between 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/7 and 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;10/71; perhaps he had the one later used by Ptolemy: 3;8:30 ([[sexagesimal]]) (''Almagest'' VI.7); but it is not known if he computed an improved value himself.\n\nBut some scholars do not believe [[\u0100ryabha\u1e6da's sine table]] has anything to do with Hipparchus's chord table which does not exist today. Some scholars do not agree with this hypothesis that Hipparchus constructed a chord table. Bo C. Klintberg states \"With mathematical reconstructions and philosophical arguments I show that Toomer's 1973 paper never contained any conclusive evidence for his claims that Hipparchus had a 3438'-based chord table, and that the Indians used that table to compute their sine tables. Recalculating Toomer's reconstructions with a 3600' radius &ndash; i.e. the radius of the chord table in Ptolemy's Almagest, expressed in 'minutes' instead of 'degrees' &ndash; generates Hipparchan-like ratios similar to those produced by a 3438' radius. It is therefore possible that the radius of Hipparchus's chord table was 3600', and that the Indians independently constructed their 3438'-based sine table.\"<ref>Reference: Hipparchus's 3600'-Based Chord Table and Its Place in the History of Ancient Greek and Indian Trigonometry, Bo C. Klintberg, Indian Journal of History of Science 40 (2):169-203 (2005)</ref>\n\nHipparchus could construct his chord table using the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and a [[theorem]] known to Archimedes. He also might have developed and used the theorem in [[Euclidean plane geometry|plane geometry]] called [[Ptolemy's theorem]], because it was proved by Ptolemy in his ''Almagest'' (I.10) (later elaborated on by [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]]).\n\nHipparchus was the first to show that the [[stereographic projection]] is [[conformal map|conformal]], and that it transforms circles on the [[sphere]] that do not pass through the center of projection to circles on the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]. This was the basis for the [[astrolabe]].\n\nBesides geometry, Hipparchus also used [[arithmetic]] techniques developed by the [[Chaldea]]ns. He was one of the first Greek mathematicians to do this, and in this way expanded the techniques available to astronomers and geographers.\n\nThere are several indications that Hipparchus knew spherical trigonometry, but the first surviving text of it is that of [[Menelaus of Alexandria]] in the 1st century, who on that basis is now commonly credited with its discovery. (Previous to the finding of the proofs of Menelaus a century ago, Ptolemy was credited with the invention of spherical trigonometry.) Ptolemy later used spherical trigonometry to compute things like the rising and setting points of the [[ecliptic]], or to take account of the lunar [[parallax]]. Hipparchus may have used a globe for these tasks, reading values off coordinate grids drawn on it, or he may have made approximations from planar geometry, or perhaps used arithmetical approximations developed by the Chaldeans. He might have used spherical trigonometry.\n\nAubrey Diller has shown that the clima calculations which [[Strabo]] preserved from Hipparchus were performed by spherical trigonometry with the sole accurate obliquity known to have been used by ancient astronomers, 23\u00b040'. All thirteen clima figures agree with Diller's proposal.<ref>Dennis Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w50.pdf \"Aubrey Diller Legacies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509041132/http://www.dioi.org/vols/w50.pdf |date=9 May 2010 }}, ''DIO'' 5 (2009); Shcheglov D.A.

Already [[al-Biruni]] (''Qanun'' VII.2.II) and [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] (''de revolutionibus'' IV.4) noted that the period of 4,267 moons is actually about 5 minutes longer than the value for the eclipse period that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus. However, the timing methods of the Babylonians had an error of no less than 8 minutes.<ref>Stephenson & Fatoohi 1993; Steele ''et al.'' 1997</ref>  Modern scholars agree that Hipparchus rounded the eclipse period to the nearest hour, and used it to confirm the validity of the traditional values, rather than try to derive an improved value from his own observations. From modern ephemerides<ref>Chapront ''et al.'' 2002</ref> and taking account of the change in the length of the day (see [[Delta T|\u0394T]]) we estimate that the error in the assumed length of the synodic month was less than 0.2 seconds in the 4th century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} and less than 0.1 seconds in Hipparchus's time.\n\n===Orbit of the Moon===\nIt had been known for a long time that the motion of the Moon is not uniform: its speed varies. This is called its ''anomaly'', and it repeats with its own period; the [[anomalistic month]]. The Chaldeans took account of this arithmetically, and used a table giving the daily motion of the Moon according to the date within a long period. The Greeks however preferred to think in geometrical models of the sky. [[Apollonius of Perga]] had at the end of the 3rd century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} proposed two models for lunar and planetary motion:\n# In the first, the Moon would move uniformly along a circle, but the Earth would be eccentric, i.e., at some distance of the center of the circle. So the apparent angular speed of the Moon (and its distance) would vary.\n# The Moon itself would move uniformly (with some mean motion in anomaly) on a secondary circular orbit, called an ''epicycle'', that itself would move uniformly (with some mean motion in longitude) over the main circular orbit around the Earth, called ''deferent''; see [[deferent and epicycle]]. Apollonius demonstrated that these two models were in fact mathematically equivalent. However, all this was theory and had not been put to practice. Hipparchus was the first astronomer we know attempted to determine the relative proportions and actual sizes of these orbits.\n\nHipparchus devised a geometrical method to find the parameters from three positions of the Moon, at particular phases of its anomaly. In fact, he did this separately for the eccentric and the epicycle model. Ptolemy describes the details in the ''Almagest'' IV.11. Hipparchus used two sets of three lunar eclipse observations, which he carefully selected to satisfy the requirements. The eccentric model he fitted to these eclipses from his Babylonian eclipse list: 22/23&nbsp;December 383&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, 18/19&nbsp;June 382&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, and 12/13&nbsp;December 382&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}. The epicycle model he fitted to lunar eclipse observations made in Alexandria at 22&nbsp;September 201&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, 19&nbsp;March 200&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, and 11&nbsp;September 200&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.\n* For the eccentric model, Hipparchus found for the ratio between the radius of the [[eccenter]] and the distance between the center of the eccenter and the center of the ecliptic (i.e., the observer on Earth): 3144 : 327+2/3 ;\n* and for the epicycle model, the ratio between the radius of the deferent and the epicycle: 3122+1/2 : 247+1/2 .\nThe somewhat weird numbers are due to the cumbersome unit he used in his chord table according to one group of historians, who explain their reconstruction's inability to agree with these four numbers as partly due to some sloppy rounding and calculation errors by Hipparchus, for which Ptolemy criticised him (he himself made rounding errors too). A simpler alternate reconstruction<ref>\nSummarized in Hugh Thurston (2002): ''Isis'' '''93''', 58\u201369.</ref> agrees with all four numbers. Anyway, Hipparchus found inconsistent results; he later used the ratio of the epicycle model (3122+1/2 : 247+1/2), which is too small (60 : 4;45 sexagesimal). Ptolemy established a ratio of 60 : 5+1/4.<ref>Toomer, 1967</ref> (The maximum angular deviation producible by this geometry is the arcsin of 5 1/4 divided by 60, or about 5\u00b0 1', a figure that is sometimes therefore quoted as the equivalent of the Moon's [[equation of the center]] in the Hipparchan model.)\n\n===Apparent motion of the Sun===\nBefore Hipparchus, [[Meton]], [[Euctemon]], and their pupils at [[Athens]] had made a solstice observation (i.e., timed the moment of the summer [[solstice]]) on 27 June 432&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} ([[proleptic Julian calendar]]). [[Aristarchus of Samos]] is said to have done so in 280&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, and Hipparchus also had an observation by [[Archimedes]]. As shown in a 1991\n[http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#nthq paper], in 158 BC Hipparchus computed a very erroneous summer solstice from [[Callippus]]'s calendar. He observed the summer solstice in 146 and 135&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} both [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#htqp accurate] to a few hours, but observations of the moment of [[equinox]] were simpler, and he made twenty during his lifetime. Ptolemy gives an extensive discussion of Hipparchus's work on the length of the year in the ''Almagest'' III.1, and quotes many observations that Hipparchus made or used, spanning 162\u2013128&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}. [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#qxhr Analysis] of Hipparchus's seventeen equinox observations made at Rhodes shows that the mean error in declination is positive seven arc minutes, nearly agreeing with the sum of refraction by air and Swerdlow's parallax. The random noise is two arc minutes or more nearly one arcminute if rounding is taken into account which approximately agrees with the sharpness of the eye. Ptolemy quotes an equinox timing by Hipparchus (at 24 March 146&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} at dawn) that differs by 5 hours from the observation made on [[Alexandria]]'s large public [[equatorial ring]] that same day (at 1 hour before noon): Hipparchus may have visited Alexandria but he did not make his equinox observations there; presumably he was on Rhodes (at nearly the same geographical longitude). He could have used the equatorial ring of his armillary sphere or another equatorial ring for these observations, but Hipparchus (and Ptolemy) knew that observations with these instruments are sensitive to a precise alignment with the [[equator]], so if he were restricted to an armillary, it would make more sense to use its meridian ring as a transit instrument. The problem with an equatorial ring (if an observer is naive enough to trust it very near dawn or dusk) is that atmospheric [[refraction]] lifts the Sun significantly above the horizon: so for a northern hemisphere observer its apparent [[declination]] is too high, which changes the observed time when the Sun crosses the equator. (Worse, the refraction decreases as the Sun rises and increases as it sets, so it may appear to move in the wrong direction with respect to the equator in the course of the day \u2013 as Ptolemy mentions. Ptolemy and Hipparchus apparently did not realize that refraction is the cause.) However, such details have doubtful relation to the data of either man, since there is no textual, scientific, or statistical ground for believing that their equinoxes were taken on an equatorial ring, which is useless for solstices in any case. Not one of two centuries of mathematical investigations of their solar errors has claimed to have traced them to the effect of refraction on use of an equatorial ring. Ptolemy claims his solar observations were on a transit instrument set in the meridian.\n\nRecent expert [http://springer.com/us/book/9789048127870 translation and analysis] by Anne Tihon of papyrus P. Fouad 267 A has confirmed the 1991 finding cited above that Hipparchus obtained a summer solstice in 158 BC But the papyrus makes the date June 26, over a day earlier than the 1991 paper's conclusion for June 28. The earlier [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w13.pdf study]'s \u00a7M found that Hipparchus did not adopt June 26 solstices until 146 BC when he founded the orbit of the sun which Ptolemy later adopted. \nDovetailing these data suggests Hipparchus extrapolated the 158 BC June 26 solstice from his 145 solstice 12 years later a procedure that would cause only minuscule error. The papyrus also confirmed that Hipparchus had used Callippic solar motion in 158 BC, a new finding in 1991 but not attested directly until P. Fouad 267 A. Another table on the papyrus is perhaps for sidereal motion and a third table is for Metonic tropical motion, using a previously unknown year of 365 1/4 \u2013 1/309 days. This was presumably found<ref>Explained at\nequation 25 of a recent [http://www.dioi.org/vols/wk0.pdf investigation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206015239/http://dioi.org/vols/wk0.pdf |date=6 February 2015 }}, paper #2.</ref> by dividing the 274 years from 432 to 158 BC, into the corresponding interval of 100077 days and 14 3/4 hours between Meton's sunrise and Hipparchus's sunset solstices.\n\nAt the end of his career, Hipparchus wrote a book called ''Peri eniaus\u00edou meg\u00e9thous'' (\"On the Length of the Year\") about his results. The established value for the [[tropical year]], introduced by [[Callippus]] in or before 330&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} was 365 + 1/4 days.<ref>{{citation|title=Babylon to Voyager and Beyond: A History of Planetary Astronomy|first=David|last=Leverington|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780521808408|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Hpi202ybn8C&pg=PA30}}.</ref> Speculating a Babylonian origin for the Callippic year is hard to defend, since Babylon did not observe solstices thus the only extant System B year length was based on Greek solstices (see below). Hipparchus's equinox observations gave varying results, but he himself points out (quoted in ''Almagest'' III.1(H195)) that the observation errors by himself and his predecessors may have been as large as 1/4 day. He used old solstice observations, and determined a difference of about one day in about 300 years. So he set the length of the tropical year to 365 + 1/4 - 1/300 days (= 365.24666... days = 365&nbsp;days 5&nbsp;hours 55&nbsp;min, which differs from the actual value (modern estimate, including earth spin acceleration) in his time of about 365.2425 days, an error of about 6&nbsp;min per year, an hour per decade, 10 hours per century.\n\nBetween the solstice observation of Meton and his own, there were 297 years spanning 108,478 days. D. Rawlins noted that this implies a tropical year of 365.24579... days = 365&nbsp;days;14,44,51 (sexagesimal; = 365&nbsp;days + 14/60 + 44/60<sup>2</sup> + 51/60<sup>3</sup>) and that this exact year length has been found on one of the few Babylonian clay tablets which explicitly specifies the System B month. This is an indication that Hipparchus's work was known to Chaldeans.<ref>[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w11.pdf ''DIO''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229121446/http://www.dioi.org/vols/w11.pdf |date=29 February 2008 }}, volume 1, number 1, pages 49\u201366; A.Jones, 2001; Thurston, ''op. cit.'', page 62</ref>\n\nAnother value for the year that is attributed to Hipparchus (by the astrologer [[Vettius Valens]] in the 1st century) is 365 + 1/4 + 1/288 days (= 365.25347... days = 365&nbsp;days 6&nbsp;hours 5&nbsp;min), but this may be a corruption of another value attributed to a Babylonian source: 365 + 1/4 + 1/144 days (= 365.25694... days = 365&nbsp;days 6&nbsp;hours 10&nbsp;min). It is not clear if this would be a value for the [[sidereal year]] (actual value at his time (modern estimate) about 365.2565 days), but the difference with Hipparchus's value for the tropical year is consistent with his rate of [[precession]] (see below).\n\n===Orbit of the Sun===\nBefore Hipparchus, astronomers knew that the lengths of the [[season]]s are not equal. Hipparchus made observations of equinox and solstice, and according to Ptolemy (''Almagest'' III.4) determined that spring (from spring equinox to summer solstice) lasted 94\u00bd days, and summer (from summer solstice to autumn equinox) 92\u00bd days. This is inconsistent with a premise of the Sun moving around the Earth in a circle at uniform speed. Hipparchus's solution was to place the Earth not at the center of the Sun's motion, but at some distance from the center. This model described the apparent motion of the Sun fairly well. It is known today that the [[planet]]s, including the Earth, move in approximate [[ellipse]]s around the Sun, but this was not discovered until [[Johannes Kepler]] published his first two laws of planetary motion in 1609. The value for the [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] attributed to Hipparchus by Ptolemy is that the offset is 1/24 of the radius of the orbit (which is a little too large), and the direction of the [[apogee]] would be at longitude 65.5\u00b0 from the [[vernal equinox]]. Hipparchus may also have used other sets of observations, which would lead to different values. One of his two eclipse trios' solar longitudes are consistent with his having initially adopted inaccurate lengths for spring and summer of 95\u00be and 91\u00bc days.<ref>Thurston, ''op. cit.'', page 67, note 16. R. Newton proposed that Hipparchus made an error of a degree in one of the trios' eclipses. D.Rawlins's theory (Thurston ''op. cit.'') that Hipparchus analysed the two trios in pairs not threesomes provides a possible explanation for the one degree slip. It was a [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#qtpt fudge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124070852/http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm |date=24 January 2018 }} necessitated by inadequacies of analysing by pairs instead of using the better method Ptolemy applies at ''[[Almagest]]'' Book 4 Parts 6 and 11.</ref> His other triplet of solar positions is consistent with 94\u00bc and 92\u00bd days,<ref>''Ibid'', note 14; Jones 2001</ref> an improvement on the results (94\u00bd and 92\u00bd days) attributed to Hipparchus by Ptolemy, which a few scholars still question the authorship of. Ptolemy made no change three centuries later, and expressed lengths for the autumn and winter seasons which were already implicit (as shown, e.g., by A. [[Aaboe]]).\n\n===Distance, parallax, size of the Moon and the Sun===\n{{main article|Hipparchus on sizes and distances}}\n[[File:HipparchusEclipse.png|thumb|400px|Diagram used in reconstructing one of Hipparchus's methods of determining the distance to the moon. This represents the earth-moon system during a partial solar eclipse at A ([[Alexandria]]) and a total solar eclipse at H ([[Hellespont]]).]]\nHipparchus also undertook to find the distances and sizes of the Sun and the Moon. He published his results in a work of two books called ''Per\u00ed megeth\u014dn ka\u00ed apost\u0113m\u00e1t\u014dn'' (\"On Sizes and Distances\") by Pappus in his commentary on the ''Almagest'' V.11; [[Theon of Smyrna]] (2nd century) mentions the work with the addition \"of the Sun and Moon\".\n\nHipparchus measured the apparent diameters of the Sun and Moon with his ''[[diopter]]''. Like others before and after him, he found that the Moon's size varies as it moves on its (eccentric) orbit, but he found no perceptible variation in the apparent diameter of the Sun. He found that at the ''[[mean]]'' distance of the Moon, the Sun and Moon had the same apparent diameter; at that distance, the Moon's diameter fits 650 times into the circle, i.e., the mean apparent diameters are 360/650 = 0\u00b033'14\".\n\nLike others before and after him, he also noticed that the Moon has a noticeable [[Lunar parallax|parallax]], i.e., that it appears displaced from its calculated position (compared to the Sun or [[star]]s), and the difference is greater when closer to the horizon. He knew that this is because in the then-current models the Moon circles the center of the Earth, but the observer is at the surface\u2014the Moon, Earth and observer form a triangle with a sharp angle that changes all the time. From the size of this parallax, the distance of the Moon as measured in Earth [[radius|radii]] can be determined. For the Sun however, there was no observable parallax (we now know that it is about 8.8\", several times smaller than the resolution of the unaided eye).\n\nIn the first book, Hipparchus assumes that the parallax of the Sun is 0, as if it is at infinite distance. He then analyzed a solar eclipse, which Toomer (against the opinion of over a century of astronomers) presumes to be the eclipse of 14 March 190&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/SE-0199--0100.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425070114/http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/SE-0199--0100.html |archivedate=25 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}, #04310, Fred Espenak, NASA/GSFC</ref> It was total in the region of the [[Hellespont]] (and in his birthplace, Nicaea); at the time Toomer proposes the Romans were preparing for war with [[Antiochus III]] in the area, and the eclipse is mentioned by [[Livy]] in his ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'' VIII.2. It was also observed in Alexandria, where the Sun was reported to be obscured 4/5ths by the Moon. Alexandria and Nicaea are on the same meridian. Alexandria is at about 31\u00b0 North, and the region of the Hellespont about 40\u00b0 North. (It has been contended that authors like Strabo and Ptolemy had fairly decent values for these geographical positions, so Hipparchus must have known them too. However, Strabo's Hipparchus dependent latitudes for this region are at least 1\u00b0 too high, and Ptolemy appears to copy them, placing Byzantium 2\u00b0 high in latitude.) Hipparchus could draw a triangle formed by the two places and the Moon, and from simple geometry was able to establish a distance of the Moon, expressed in Earth radii. Because the eclipse occurred in the morning, the Moon was not in the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]], and it has been proposed that as a consequence the distance found by Hipparchus was a lower limit. In any case, according to Pappus, Hipparchus found that the least distance is 71 (from this eclipse), and the greatest 81 Earth radii.\n\nIn the second book, Hipparchus starts from the opposite extreme assumption: he assigns a (minimum) distance to the Sun of 490 Earth radii. This would correspond to a parallax of 7', which is apparently the greatest parallax that Hipparchus thought would not be noticed (for comparison: the typical resolution of the human eye is about 2'; [[Tycho Brahe]] made naked eye observation with an accuracy down to 1'). In this case, the shadow of the Earth is a [[conical surface|cone]] rather than a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] as under the first assumption. Hipparchus observed (at lunar eclipses) that at the mean distance of the Moon, the diameter of the shadow cone is 2+\u00bd lunar diameters. That apparent diameter is, as he had observed, 360/650 degrees. With these values and simple geometry, Hipparchus could determine the mean distance; because it was computed for a minimum distance of the Sun, it is the maximum mean distance possible for the Moon. With his value for the eccentricity of the orbit, he could compute the least and greatest distances of the Moon too. According to Pappus, he found a least distance of 62, a mean of 67+1/3, and consequently a greatest distance of 72+2/3 Earth radii. With this method, as the parallax of the Sun decreases (i.e., its distance increases), the minimum limit for the mean distance is 59 Earth radii \u2013 exactly the mean distance that Ptolemy later derived.\n\nHipparchus thus had the problematic result that his minimum distance (from book 1) was greater than his maximum mean distance (from book 2). He was intellectually honest about this discrepancy, and probably realized that especially the first method is very sensitive to the accuracy of the observations and parameters. (In fact, modern calculations show that the size of the 189&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} solar eclipse at Alexandria must have been closer to 9/10ths and not the reported 4/5ths, a fraction more closely matched by the degree of totality at Alexandria of eclipses occurring in 310 and 129&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} which were also nearly total in the Hellespont and are thought by many to be more likely possibilities for the eclipse Hipparchus used for his computations.)\n\nPtolemy later measured the lunar parallax directly (''Almagest'' V.13), and used the second method of Hipparchus with lunar eclipses to compute the distance of the Sun (''Almagest'' V.15). He criticizes Hipparchus for making contradictory assumptions, and obtaining conflicting results (''Almagest'' V.11): but apparently he failed to understand Hipparchus's strategy to establish limits consistent with the observations, rather than a single value for the distance. His results were the best so far: the actual mean distance of the Moon is 60.3 Earth radii, within his limits from Hipparchus's second book.\n\n[[Theon of Smyrna]] wrote that according to Hipparchus, the Sun is 1,880 times the size of the Earth, and the Earth twenty-seven times the size of the Moon; apparently this refers to [[volume]]s, not [[diameter]]s. From the geometry of book 2 it follows that the Sun is at 2,550 Earth radii, and the mean distance of the Moon is 60\u00bd radii. Similarly, [[Cleomedes]] quotes Hipparchus for the sizes of the Sun and Earth as 1050:1; this leads to a mean lunar distance of 61 radii. Apparently Hipparchus later refined his computations, and derived accurate single values that he could use for predictions of solar eclipses.\n\nSee [Toomer 1974] for a more detailed discussion.\n\n===Eclipses===\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (''Naturalis Historia'' II.X) tells us that Hipparchus demonstrated that lunar eclipses can occur five months apart, and solar eclipses seven months (instead of the usual six months); and the Sun can be hidden twice in thirty days, but as seen by different nations. Ptolemy discussed this a century later at length in ''Almagest'' VI.6. The geometry, and the limits of the positions of Sun and Moon when a solar or lunar eclipse is possible, are explained in ''Almagest'' VI.5. Hipparchus apparently made similar calculations. The result that two solar eclipses can occur one month apart is important, because this can not be based on observations: one is visible on the northern and the other on the southern hemisphere \u2013 as Pliny indicates \u2013 and the latter was inaccessible to the Greek.\n\nPrediction of a solar eclipse, i.e., exactly when and where it will be visible, requires a solid lunar theory and proper treatment of the lunar parallax. Hipparchus must have been the first to be able to do this. A rigorous treatment requires [[spherical trigonometry]], thus those who remain certain that Hipparchus lacked it must speculate that he may have made do with planar approximations. He may have discussed these things in ''Per\u00ed t\u0113s kat\u00e1 pl\u00e1tos m\u0113nia\u00edas t\u0113s sel\u0113n\u0113s kin\u0113se\u014ds'' (\"On the monthly motion of the Moon in latitude\"), a work mentioned in the ''[[Suda]]''.\n\nPliny also remarks that \"he also discovered for what exact reason, although the shadow causing the eclipse must from sunrise onward be below the earth, it happened once in the past that the moon was eclipsed in the west while both luminaries were visible above the earth\" (translation H. Rackham (1938), [[Loeb Classical Library]] 330 p.&nbsp;207). Toomer (1980) argued that this must refer to the large total lunar eclipse of 26 November 139&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, when over a clean sea horizon as seen from Rhodes, the Moon was eclipsed in the northwest just after the Sun rose in the southeast. This would be the second eclipse of the 345-year interval that Hipparchus used to verify the traditional Babylonian periods: this puts a late date to the development of Hipparchus's lunar theory. We do not know what \"exact reason\" Hipparchus found for seeing the Moon eclipsed while apparently it was not in exact [[astronomical opposition|opposition]] to the Sun. Parallax lowers the altitude of the luminaries; refraction raises them, and from a high point of view the horizon is lowered.\n\n==Astronomical instruments and astrometry==\nHipparchus and his predecessors used various instruments for astronomical calculations and observations, such as the [[gnomon]], the [[astrolabe]], and the [[armillary sphere]].\n\nHipparchus is credited with the invention or improvement of several astronomical instruments, which were used for a long time for naked-eye observations. According to [[Synesius]] of Ptolemais (4th century) he made the first ''astrolabion'': this may have been an [[armillary sphere]] (which Ptolemy however says he constructed, in ''Almagest'' V.1); or the predecessor of the planar instrument called astrolabe (also mentioned by [[Theon of Alexandria]]). With an astrolabe Hipparchus was the first to be able to measure the geographical [[latitude]] and [[time]] by observing fixed stars. Previously this was done at daytime by measuring the shadow cast by a gnomon, by recording the length of the longest day of the year or with the portable instrument known as a ''[[scaphe]]''.\n\n[[Image:equatorial ring.png|thumb|right|200px| [[Equatorial ring]] of Hipparchus's time.]]\n\nPtolemy mentions (''Almagest'' V.14) that he used a similar instrument as Hipparchus, called ''[[dioptra]]'', to measure the apparent diameter of the Sun and Moon. [[Pappus of Alexandria]] described it (in his commentary on the ''Almagest'' of that chapter), as did [[Proclus]] (''Hypotyposis'' IV). It was a 4-foot rod with a scale, a sighting hole at one end, and a wedge that could be moved along the rod to exactly obscure the disk of Sun or Moon.\n\nHipparchus also observed solar [[equinox]]es, which may be done with an [[equatorial ring]]: its shadow falls on itself when the Sun is on the [[equator]] (i.e., in one of the equinoctial points on the [[ecliptic]]), but the shadow falls above or below the opposite side of the ring when the Sun is south or north of the equator. Ptolemy quotes (in ''Almagest'' III.1 (H195)) a description by Hipparchus of an equatorial ring in Alexandria; a little further he describes two such instruments present in Alexandria in his own time.\n\nHipparchus applied his knowledge of spherical angles to the problem of denoting locations on the Earth's surface. Before him a grid system had been used by [[Dicaearchus]] of [[Messina, Italy|Messana]], but Hipparchus was the first to apply mathematical rigor to the determination of the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of places on the Earth. Hipparchus wrote a critique in three books on the work of the geographer [[Eratosthenes]] of Cyrene (3rd century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}), called ''Pr\u00f2s t\u00e8n 'Eratosth\u00e9nous geograf\u00edan'' (\"Against the Geography of Eratosthenes\"). It is known to us from [[Strabo]] of Amaseia, who in his turn criticised Hipparchus in his own ''Geografia''. Hipparchus apparently made many detailed corrections to the locations and distances mentioned by Eratosthenes. It seems he did not introduce many improvements in methods, but he did propose a means to determine the [[geographic coordinate system|geographical longitudes]] of different [[city|cities]] at [[lunar eclipse]]s (Strabo ''Geografia'' 1 January 2012). A lunar eclipse is visible simultaneously on half of the Earth, and the difference in longitude between places can be computed from the difference in local time when the eclipse is observed. His approach would give accurate results if it were correctly carried out but the limitations of timekeeping accuracy in his era made this method impractical.\n\n==Star catalog==\n[[File:Hipparchus by Raphael.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Hipparchus holding his celestial globe, in [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (c. 1510)]]\nLate in his career (possibly about 135&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}) Hipparchus compiled his star catalog, the original of which does not survive. He also constructed a celestial globe depicting the constellations, based on his observations. His interest in the [[fixed star]]s may have been inspired by the observation of a [[supernova]] (according to Pliny), or by his discovery of precession, according to Ptolemy, who says that Hipparchus could not reconcile his data with earlier observations made by [[Timocharis]] and [[Aristillus]]. For more information see [[Discovery of precession]]. In [[Raphael]]'s painting ''[[The School of Athens]]'', Hipparchus is depicted holding his celestial globe, as the representative figure for astronomy.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Swerdlow | first = N.

[[Aratus]] wrote a poem called ''Phaenomena'' or ''Arateia'' based on Eudoxus's work. Hipparchus wrote a commentary on the ''Arateia'' \u2013 his only preserved work \u2013 which contains many stellar positions and times for rising, culmination, and setting of the constellations, and these are likely to have been based on his own measurements.\n\nHipparchus made his measurements with an [[armillary sphere]], and obtained the positions of at least 850 stars. It is disputed which coordinate system(s) he used. Ptolemy's catalog in the ''[[Almagest]]'', which is derived from Hipparchus's catalog, is given in [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates]]. However Delambre in his ''Histoire de l'Astronomie Ancienne'' (1817) concluded that Hipparchus knew and used the [[equatorial coordinate system]], a conclusion challenged by [[Otto Neugebauer]] in his ''A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy'' (1975). Hipparchus seems to have used a mix of [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates]] and [[equatorial coordinate system|equatorial coordinates]]: in his commentary on Eudoxos he provides stars' polar distance (equivalent to the [[declination]] in the equatorial system), right ascension (equatorial), longitude (ecliptical), polar longitude (hybrid), but not celestial latitude.\n\nAs with most of his work, Hipparchus's star catalog was adopted and perhaps expanded by Ptolemy.

Ptolemy has even (since Brahe, 1598) been accused by astronomers of fraud for stating (''Syntaxis'', book 7, chapter 4) that he observed all 1025 stars: for almost every star he used Hipparchus's data and precessed it to his own epoch {{fraction|2|2|3}} centuries later by adding 2\u00b040' to the longitude, using an erroneously small precession constant of 1\u00b0 per century.\n\nIn any case the work started by Hipparchus has had a lasting heritage, and was much later updated by [['Abd Al-Rahman Al Sufi|Al Sufi]] (964) and Copernicus (1543). [[Ulugh Beg]] reobserved all the Hipparchus stars he could see from Samarkand in 1437 to about the same accuracy as Hipparchus's. The catalog was superseded only in the late 16th century by Brahe and Wilhelm IV of Kassel via superior ruled instruments and spherical trigonometry, which improved accuracy by an order of magnitude even before the invention of the telescope. Hipparchus is considered the greatest observational astronomer from classical antiquity until Brahe.<ref>Benson Bobrick, ''The Fated Sky'', Simon & Schuster, 2005, p 151</ref>\n\n===Stellar magnitude===\nHipparchus ranked stars in three [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] very general classes according to their brightness but he did not assign a numerical brightness value to any star.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The magnitude system ranging from 1 (brightest) to 6 (faintest) was established by Ptolemy.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} That system by Ptolemy is effectively still in use today, though extended and made more precise through the introduction of a logarithmic scale by [[N. R. Pogson]] in 1856.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Precession of the equinoxes (146\u2013127&nbsp;{{sc|bc}})==\n{{see also|Precession (astronomy)}}\n\nHipparchus is generally recognized as discoverer of the [[precession]] of the [[equinox]]es in 127&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.<ref>Alexander Jones \"Ptolemy in Perspective: Use and Criticism of his Work from Antiquity to the Nineteenth Century, Springer, 2010, p.36.</ref>  His two books on precession, ''On the Displacement of the Solsticial and Equinoctial Points'' and ''On the Length of the Year'', are both mentioned in the ''[[Almagest]]'' of Claudius [[Ptolemy]]. According to Ptolemy, Hipparchus measured the longitude of [[Spica]] and [[Regulus]] and other bright stars. Comparing his measurements with data from his predecessors, [[Timocharis]] and [[Aristillus]], he concluded that Spica had moved 2\u00b0 relative to the [[autumnal equinox]]. He also compared the lengths of the [[tropical year]] (the time it takes the Sun to return to an equinox) and the [[sidereal year]] (the time it takes the Sun to return to a fixed star), and found a slight discrepancy. Hipparchus concluded that the equinoxes were moving (\"precessing\") through the zodiac, and that the rate of precession was not less than 1\u00b0 in a century.\n\n==Geography==\nHipparchus's treatise \"Against the Geography of [[Eratosthenes]]\" in three books is not preserved.<ref>Editions of fragments: Berger H.

In his enrolment in the University of Vienna (1500), he still latinised his name as ''Udalricus Zwingling de [[Lichtensteig]]'' ({{Harvnb|Jackson|1900|p=57}}).\nHis signature at the Marburg Colloquy (1529) was ''Huldrychus Zwinglius''  ({{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=251}}; Schuler, Schultess (eds.), ''Huldrici Zuinglii opera'', 1830, p. 55). \nModern literature uses either \"Ulrich\" or \"Huldrych\" (e.g. [[George Richard Potter|Potter]] uses \"Ulrich\", while G\u00e4bler, Stephens, and Furcha use \"Huldrych\").}} (1 January 1484&nbsp;\u2013 11 October 1531) was a leader of the [[Reformation in Switzerland]]. Born during a time of emerging [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] patriotism and increasing criticism of the [[Swiss mercenaries|Swiss mercenary system]], he attended the [[University of Vienna]] and the [[University of Basel]], a scholarly center of [[Renaissance humanism]]. He continued his studies while he served as a pastor in [[Glarus]] and later in [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]], where he was influenced by the writings of [[Erasmus]].\n\nIn 1519, Zwingli became the pastor of the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]] where he began to preach ideas on reform of the [[Catholic Church]]. In his first public controversy in 1522, he attacked the [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|custom of fasting]] during [[Lent]]. In his publications, he noted corruption in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, promoted clerical marriage, and attacked the use of [[Icon|images]] in places of worship. In 1525, Zwingli introduced a new [[Eucharist|communion]] [[liturgy]] to replace the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Zwingli also clashed with the [[Anabaptists]], which resulted in their persecution.  Historians have debated whether or not he turned Z\u00fcrich into a [[theocracy]].<ref>Robert Walton, ''Zwingli's Theocracy'' (Toronto University Press. 1967).</ref>\n\nThe Reformation spread to other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] resisted, preferring to remain [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. Zwingli formed an alliance of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war between the two sides was averted at the last moment. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of [[Martin Luther]] and other reformers. They met at the [[Marburg Colloquy]] and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the [[Real Presence|Real Presence of Christ]] in the [[Eucharist]].\n\nIn 1531 Zwingli's alliance applied an unsuccessful food blockade on the Catholic cantons. The cantons responded with an attack at a moment when Z\u00fcrich was ill-prepared. Zwingli died on the battlefield. His legacy lives on in the [[Reformed Christian confessions of faith|confessions]], liturgy, and church orders of the [[Reformed churches]] of today.\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:Historische Karte CH 1515.png|thumb|right|260px|Map of the Swiss Confederation in 1515]]\nThe [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]] in Huldrych Zwingli's time consisted of thirteen states ([[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]) as well as affiliated areas and common lordships. Unlike the modern state of [[Switzerland]], which operates under a federal government, each of the thirteen cantons was nearly independent, conducting its own domestic and foreign affairs. Each canton formed its own alliances within and without the Confederation. This relative independence served as the basis for conflict during the time of the Reformation when the various cantons divided between different confessional camps. Military ambitions gained an additional impetus with the competition to acquire new territory and resources, as seen for example in the [[Old Z\u00fcrich War]] of 1440\u20131446.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=1\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThe wider political environment in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries was also volatile. For centuries the relationship with the Confederation's powerful neighbour, France, determined the foreign policies of the Swiss. Nominally, the Confederation formed a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. However, through a succession of wars culminating in the [[Swabian War]] in 1499, the Confederation had become ''de facto'' independent. As the two continental powers and minor regional states such as the [[Duchy of Milan]], the [[Duchy of Savoy]], and the [[Papal States]] competed and fought against each other, there were far-reaching political, economic, and social consequences for the Confederation. During this time the [[Swiss mercenaries|mercenary pension system]] became a subject of disagreement. The religious factions of Zwingli's time debated vociferously the merits of sending young Swiss men to fight in foreign wars mainly for the enrichment of the cantonal authorities.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=4\u20136}}</ref>\n\nThese internal and external factors contributed to the rise of a Confederation national consciousness, in which the term ''fatherland'' ({{lang-la |patria}}) began to take on meaning beyond a reference to an individual canton. At the same time, [[Renaissance humanism]], with its universal values and emphasis on scholarship (as exemplified by [[Erasmus]] (1466\u20131536), the \"prince of humanism\"), had taken root in the Confederation. Within this environment, defined by the confluence of Swiss [[patriotism]] and humanism, Zwingli was born in 1484.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years (1484\u20131518)===\n[[File:Geburtshaus von Huldrych Zwingli.jpg|thumb|right|260px|House where Zwingli was born in [[Wildhaus]] in what is now the [[Canton of St. Gallen]]]]\nHuldrych Zwingli was born on 1 January 1484 in [[Wildhaus]], in the [[Toggenburg]] valley of [[Switzerland]], to a family of farmers, the third child of nine. His father, Ulrich, played a leading role in the administration of the community (''[[Amtmann]]'' or chief local magistrate).<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=6}}</ref> Zwingli's primary schooling was provided by his uncle, Bartholomew, a cleric in [[Weesen]], where he probably met [[Katharina von Zimmern]].<ref name=\"katharina\">{{cite web|url=http://frauen-und-reformation.de/?s=bio&id=93|title=Katharina von Zimmern|publisher=frauen-und-reformation.de|author=|date=|accessdate=2014-10-25}}</ref> At ten years old, Zwingli was sent to [[Basel]] to obtain his secondary education where he learned [[Latin language|Latin]] under Magistrate Gregory B\u00fcnzli. After three years in Basel, he stayed a short time in [[Bern]] with the humanist, Henry W\u00f6lfflin. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in Bern tried to persuade Zwingli to join their order and it is possible that he was received as a novice.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}. Potter mentions this possibility. G\u00e4bler states that Zwingli did not refute later claims by opponents that he had been a monk in Bern.</ref> However, his father and uncle disapproved of such a course and he left Bern without completing his Latin studies.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}</ref> He enrolled in the [[University of Vienna]] in the winter semester of 1498 but was expelled, according to the university's records. However, it is not certain that Zwingli was indeed expelled, and he re-enrolled in the summer semester of 1500; his activities in 1499 are unknown.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=25}}. The word ''exclusus'' (expelled) was added to his matriculation entry. G\u00e4bler notes that without a date and reason, it does not conform to what was customary at the time.</ref> Zwingli continued his studies in Vienna until 1502, after which he transferred to the [[University of Basel]] where he received the Master of Arts degree (''Magister'') in 1506.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=26}}</ref>\n\nZwingli was ordained in [[Constance]], the seat of the local diocese, and he celebrated his first [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in his hometown, Wildhaus, on 29 September 1506. As a young priest he had studied little theology, but this was not considered unusual at the time. His first ecclesiastical post was the pastorate of the town of [[Glarus]], where he stayed for ten years. It was in Glarus, whose soldiers were used as mercenaries in Europe, that Zwingli became involved in politics. The Swiss Confederation was embroiled in various campaigns with its neighbours: the French, the Habsburgs, and the Papal States. Zwingli placed himself solidly on the side of the [[Holy See|Roman See]]. In return, [[Pope Julius II]] honoured Zwingli by providing him with an annual pension. He took the role of chaplain in several campaigns in Italy, including the [[Battle of Novara (1513)|Battle of Novara]] in 1513. However, the decisive defeat of the Swiss in the [[Battle of Marignano]] caused a shift in mood in Glarus in favour of the French rather than the pope. Zwingli, the papal partisan, found himself in a difficult position and he decided to retreat to [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]] in the [[canton of Schwyz]]. By this time, he had become convinced that mercenary service was immoral and that Swiss unity was indispensable for any future achievements. Some of his earliest extant writings, such as ''The Ox'' (1510) and ''The Labyrinth'' (1516), attacked the mercenary system using allegory and satire. His countrymen were presented as virtuous people within a French, imperial, and papal triangle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=8}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=35, 37}}</ref> Zwingli stayed in Einsiedeln for two years during which he withdrew completely from politics in favour of ecclesiastical activities and personal studies.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=29\u201333}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=22\u201340}}</ref>\n\nZwingli's time as the pastor of Glarus and Einsiedeln was characterized by inner growth and development. He perfected his [[Greek language|Greek]] and he took up the study of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. His library contained over three hundred volumes from which he was able to draw upon [[Classics|classical]], [[patristic]], and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] works. He exchanged scholarly letters with a circle of Swiss humanists and began to study the writings of Erasmus. Zwingli took the opportunity to meet him while Erasmus was in Basel between August 1514 and May 1516. Zwingli's turn to relative [[pacifism]] and his focus on preaching can be traced to the influence of Erasmus.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=33\u201341}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1518, the post of the ''Leutpriestertum'' (people's priest) of the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]] at [[Z\u00fcrich]] became vacant. The [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of the foundation that administered the Grossm\u00fcnster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a decisive factor as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, his opposition to the French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Z\u00fcrich politicians. On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=43\u201344}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=45\u201346}}</ref>\n\n===Z\u00fcrich ministry begins (1519\u20131521)===\n[[File:Prozessionsachse murerplan.jpg|thumb|right|The Grossm\u00fcnster in the centre of the medieval town of Z\u00fcrich ([[Murerplan]], 1576)]]\nOn 1 January 1519, Zwingli gave his first sermon in Z\u00fcrich. Deviating from the prevalent practice of basing a sermon on the Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using [[Erasmus]]' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the [[Gospel of Matthew]], giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of ''[[lectio continua]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Old|1998|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays until he reached the end and then proceeded in the same manner with the [[Acts of the Apostles]], the New Testament [[epistles]], and finally the [[Old Testament]]. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor [[Lutheran]]. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=44\u201345}}</ref> One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=46}}. Proponents of this view are Oskar Farner and Walther K\u00f6hler.</ref> Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=46}}. Proponents of this view are Arthur Rich and Cornelius Augustijn.</ref> A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=46\u201347}}. A proponent of this view is Gottfried W. Locher.</ref>\n\nZwingli's theological stance was gradually revealed through his sermons. He attacked moral corruption and in the process he named individuals who were the targets of his denunciations. Monks were accused of indolence and high living. In 1519, Zwingli specifically rejected the [[veneration]] of saints and called for the need to distinguish between their true and fictional accounts. He cast doubts on hellfire, asserted that unbaptised children were not damned, and questioned the power of [[excommunication]]. His attack on the claim that [[Tithe|tithing]] was a divine institution, however, had the greatest theological and social impact.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=50}}</ref> This contradicted the immediate economic interests of the foundation. One of the elderly canons who had supported Zwingli's election, Konrad Hofmann, complained about his sermons in a letter. Some canons supported Hofmann, but the opposition never grew very large. Zwingli insisted that he was not an innovator and that the [[Sola scriptura|sole basis of his teachings was Scripture]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=49\u201352}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=66}}</ref>\n\nWithin the [[Bishopric of Constance|diocese of Constance]], Bernhardin Sanson was offering a special [[indulgence]] for contributors to the building of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]] in Rome. When Sanson arrived at the gates of Z\u00fcrich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions. He responded with displeasure that the people were not being properly informed about the conditions of the indulgence and were being induced to part with their money on false pretences. This was over a year after [[Martin Luther]] published his [[Ninety-five theses]] (31 October 1517).<ref>{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=XII}}</ref> The council of Z\u00fcrich refused Sanson entry into the city. As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain the fire started by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=44, 66\u201367}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1519, Z\u00fcrich was struck by an outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] during which at least one in four persons died. All of those who could afford it left the city, but Zwingli remained and continued his pastoral duties. In September, he caught the disease and nearly died. He described his preparation for death in a poem, Zwingli's ''Pestlied'', consisting of three parts: the onset of the illness, the closeness to death, and the joy of recovery. The final verses of the first part read:<ref>see e.g. {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=69\u201370}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n:''Thuo, wie du wilt;''\n:''mich n\u00fct befilt.''\n:''Din haf bin ich.''\n:''Mach gantz ald brich;''\n:''dann nimpst mich hin''\n:''der geiste min von diser Erd,''\n:''thuost du's, dass er nit b\u00f6ser werd,''\n:''ald anderen nit''\n:''befleck ir l\u00e4ben fromm und sit.

When a vacancy occurred among the canons of the Grossm\u00fcnster, Zwingli was elected to fulfill that vacancy on 29 April 1521. In becoming a canon, he became a full citizen of Z\u00fcrich. He also retained his post as the people's priest of the Grossm\u00fcnster.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=51}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=73}}</ref>\n\n===First rifts (1522\u20131524)===\nThe first public controversy regarding Zwingli's preaching broke out during the season of [[Lent]] in 1522. On the first fasting Sunday, 9 March, Zwingli and about a dozen other participants consciously transgressed the fasting rule by cutting and distributing two smoked sausages (the ''Wurstessen'' in [[Christoph Froschauer]]'s workshop). Zwingli defended this act in a sermon which was published on 16 April, under the title ''Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen'' (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods). He noted that no general valid rule on food can be derived from the Bible and that to transgress such a rule is not a sin. The event, which came to be referred to as the [[Affair of the Sausages]], is considered to be the start of the Reformation in Switzerland.<ref name=\"Janz2008\">{{cite book|author=Denis Janz|title=A Reformation reader: primary texts with introductions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJWyDNATVwcC&pg=PA183|accessdate=15 January 2012|year=2008|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-6310-0|page=183}}</ref> Even before the publication of this treatise, the diocese of Constance reacted by sending a delegation to Z\u00fcrich. The city council condemned the fasting violation, but assumed responsibility over ecclesiastical matters and requested the religious authorities clarify the issue. The bishop responded on 24 May by admonishing the Grossm\u00fcnster and city council and repeating the traditional position.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=52\u201356}}</ref>\n\nFollowing this event, Zwingli and other humanist friends petitioned the bishop on 2 July to abolish the requirement of celibacy on the clergy. Two weeks later the petition was reprinted for the public in German as ''Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung an die Eidgenossen'' (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates). The issue was not just an abstract problem for Zwingli, as he had secretly married a widow, Anna Reinhard, earlier in the year. Their cohabitation was well-known and their public wedding took place on 2 April 1524, three months before the birth of their first child.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=80}}</ref> They would eventually have four children: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna. As the petition was addressed to the secular authorities, the bishop responded at the same level by notifying the Z\u00fcrich government to maintain the ecclesiastical order. Other Swiss clergymen joined in Zwingli's cause which encouraged him to make his first major statement of faith, ''Apologeticus Archeteles'' (The First and Last Word). He defended himself against charges of inciting unrest and heresy. He denied the ecclesiastical hierarchy any right to judge on matters of church order because of its corrupted state.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=57\u201359}}</ref>\n\n===Z\u00fcrich disputations (1523)===\n[[File:Switzerland Z\u00fcrich Grossm\u00fcnster Zwingli M\u00fcnch 1935.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Relief]] of Zwingli preaching at the pulpit, [[Otto M\u00fcnch]], 1935]]\nThe events of 1522 brought no clarification on the issues. Not only did the unrest between Z\u00fcrich and the bishop continue, tensions were growing among Z\u00fcrich's Confederation partners in the [[Tagsatzung|Swiss Diet]]. On 22 December, the Diet recommended that its members prohibit the new teachings, a strong indictment directed at Z\u00fcrich. The city council felt obliged to take the initiative and find its own solution.\n\n====First Disputation====\nOn 3 January 1523, the Z\u00fcrich city council invited the clergy of the city and outlying region to a meeting to allow the factions to present their opinions. The bishop was invited to attend or to send a representative. The council would render a decision on who would be allowed to continue to proclaim their views. This meeting, the first Z\u00fcrich disputation, took place on 29 January 1523.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=63\u201365}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=97\u2013100}}</ref>\n\nThe meeting attracted a large crowd of approximately six hundred participants. The bishop sent a delegation led by his [[vicar general]], [[Johann Faber|Johannes Fabri]]. Zwingli summarised his position in the ''Schlussreden'' (Concluding Statements or the Sixty-seven Articles).<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=99}}</ref><ref>The Sixty-seven Articles are contained in [https://archive.org/details/selectedworksofh00zwin ''Selected Works of Huldreich Zwingli'', Philadelphia, 1901], pp.&nbsp;111\u2013117.

The decision of the council was that Zwingli would be allowed to continue his preaching and that all other preachers should teach only in accordance with Scripture.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=67\u201371}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=100\u2013104}}</ref>\n\n====Second Disputation====\nIn September 1523, [[Leo Jud]], Zwingli's closest friend and colleague and pastor of [[St. Peter, Z\u00fcrich|St. Peterskirche]], publicly called for the removal of statues of saints and other icons. This led to demonstrations and [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] activities. The city council decided to work out the matter of images in a second disputation. The essence of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and its sacrificial character was also included as a subject of discussion. Supporters of the mass claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal. As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Z\u00fcrich clergy and the bishop of Constance. This time, however, the lay people of Z\u00fcrich, the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur|Chur]] and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited. About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, but neither the bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives. The disputation started on 26 October 1523 and lasted two days.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=72, 76\u201377}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=130\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nZwingli again took the lead in the disputation. His opponent was the aforementioned canon, Konrad Hofmann, who had initially supported Zwingli's election. Also taking part was a group of young men demanding a much faster pace of reformation, who among other things pleaded for replacing [[infant baptism]] with [[Credobaptism|adult baptism]]. This group was led by [[Conrad Grebel]], one of the initiators of the [[Anabaptist]] movement. During the first three days of dispute, although the controversy of images and the mass were discussed, the arguments led to the question of whether the city council or the ecclesiastical government had the authority to decide on these issues. At this point, Konrad Schmid, a priest from [[Aargau]] and follower of Zwingli, made a pragmatic suggestion. As images were not yet considered to be valueless by everyone, he suggested that pastors preach on this subject under threat of punishment. He believed the opinions of the people would gradually change and the voluntary removal of images would follow. Hence, Schmid rejected the radicals and their iconoclasm, but supported Zwingli's position. In November the council passed ordinances in support of Schmid's motion. Zwingli wrote a booklet on the evangelical duties of a minister, ''Kurze, christliche Einleitung'' (Short Christian Introduction), and the council sent it out to the clergy and the members of the Confederation.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=78\u201381}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=131\u2013135}}</ref>\n\n===Reformation progresses in Z\u00fcrich (1524\u20131525)===\n[[File:Zue Grossmuenster 06.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Above the entrance to the Grossm\u00fcnster doors is inscribed Matthew 11:28, \"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\"]]\nIn December 1523, the council set a deadline of [[Pentecost]] in 1524 for a solution to the elimination of the mass and images. Zwingli gave a formal opinion in ''Vorschlag wegen der Bilder und der Messe'' (Proposal Concerning Images and the Mass). He did not urge an immediate, general abolition. The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Z\u00fcrich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote. The decision on the mass was postponed.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=81\u201382}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of the effect of the Reformation was seen in early 1524. [[Candlemas]] was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on [[Palm Sunday]] to the [[Lindenhof]], and [[triptych]]s remained covered and closed after [[Lent]].<ref name=\"Potter138\">{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=138}}</ref> Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=82\u201383}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the council had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the decrease in the exercise of traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in ''Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls'' (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before [[Easter]], Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On [[Maundy Thursday]], 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was the focal point of the service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=105\u2013106}}</ref>\n\nFor some time Zwingli had accused [[mendicant]] orders of hypocrisy and demanded their abolition in order to support the truly poor. He suggested the monasteries be changed into hospitals and welfare institutions and incorporate their wealth into a welfare fund. This was done by reorganising the foundations of the Grossm\u00fcnster and [[Fraum\u00fcnster]] and pensioning off remaining nuns and monks. The council secularised the church properties (Fraum\u00fcnster handed over by Zwingli's acquaintance [[Katharina von Zimmern]]) and established new welfare programs for the poor. Zwingli requested permission to establish a Latin school, the ''Prophezei'' (Prophecy) or [[Carolinum, Z\u00fcrich|''Carolinum'']], at the Grossm\u00fcnster. The council agreed and it was officially opened on 19 June 1525 with Zwingli and Jud as teachers. It served to retrain and re-educate the clergy. The [[Z\u00fcrich Bible]] translation, traditionally attributed to Zwingli and printed by [[Christoph Froschauer]], bears the mark of teamwork from the Prophecy school.<ref>According to {{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=102}}, the first complete Bible was printed in 1531. Other sources say 1529 or 1530. See {{Harvnb|Estep|1986|p=96}} and {{Harvnb|Greenslade|1975|p=106}}. Early editions were called the Froschauer Bible, see {{Harvnb|Chadwick|2001|p=35}}.</ref> Scholars have not yet attempted to clarify Zwingli's share of the work based on external and stylistic evidence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=222\u2013223}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=97\u2013103}}</ref>\n\n===Conflict with the Anabaptists (1525\u20131527)===\nShortly after the second Z\u00fcrich disputation, many in the [[Radical Reformation|radical wing of the Reformation]] became convinced that Zwingli was making too many concessions to the Z\u00fcrich council. They rejected the role of civil government and demanded the immediate establishment of a congregation of the faithful. [[Conrad Grebel]], the leader of the radicals and the emerging Anabaptist movement, spoke disparagingly of Zwingli in private. On 15 August 1524 the council insisted on the obligation to baptise all newborn infants. Zwingli secretly conferred with Grebel's group and late in 1524, the council called for official discussions. When talks were broken off, Zwingli published ''Wer Ursache gebe zu Aufruhr'' (Whoever Causes Unrest) clarifying the opposing points-of-view.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=125\u2013126}}</ref> On 17 January 1525 a public debate was held and the council decided in favour of Zwingli. Anyone refusing to have their children baptised was required to leave Z\u00fcrich. The radicals ignored these measures and on 21 January, they met at the house of the mother of another radical leader, [[Felix Manz]]. Grebel and a third leader, [[George Blaurock]], performed the first recorded Anabaptist [[Credobaptism|adult baptisms]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=177\u2013182}}</ref>\n\nOn February 2, the council repeated the requirement on the baptism of all babies and some who failed to comply were arrested and fined, Manz and Blaurock among them. Zwingli and Jud interviewed them and more debates were held before the Z\u00fcrich council. Meanwhile, the new teachings continued to spread to other parts of the Confederation as well as a number of [[Swabia]]n towns. On 6\u20138 November, the last debate on the subject of baptism took place in the Grossm\u00fcnster. Grebel, Manz, and Blaurock defended their cause before Zwingli, Jud, and other reformers. There was no serious exchange of views as each side would not move from their positions and the debates degenerated into an uproar, each side shouting abuse at the other.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=183\u2013186}}</ref>\n\nThe Z\u00fcrich council decided that no compromise was possible. On 7 March 1526 it released the notorious mandate that no one shall rebaptise another under the penalty of death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=187}}</ref> Although Zwingli, technically, had nothing to do with the mandate, there is no indication that he disapproved. Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Z\u00fcrich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice. After he was arrested and tried, he was executed on 5 January 1527 by being drowned in the [[Limmat]]. He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=186\u2013188}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sharp|first=John|title=The Reformation and the Anabaptists: Steps to Reconciliation, 26 June, 2004, Zurich, Switzerland|publisher=Mennonite Historical Committee|date=July 2004|url=http://www.mcusa-archives.org/events/statements_index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324075102/http://www.mcusa-archives.org/events/statements_index.htm|archivedate=2012-03-24|accessdate=2012-12-23}} The descendants of the Zwinglian Reformation, the Reformed Church of Z\u00fcrich, and the descendants of the Anabaptist movement ([[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], and [[Mennonites]]) held a Reconciliation Conference at the Grossm\u00fcnster on 26 June 2004.

Eck offered to dispute Zwingli and he accepted. However, they could not agree on the selection of the judging authority, the location of the debate, and the use of the Swiss Diet as a court. Because of the disagreements, Zwingli decided to boycott the disputation. On 19 May 1526, all the cantons sent delegates to [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]]. Although Z\u00fcrich's representatives were present, they did not participate in the sessions. Eck led the Catholic party while the reformers were represented by [[Johannes Oecolampadius]] of Basel, a theologian from [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] who had carried on an extensive and friendly correspondence with Zwingli. While the debate proceeded, Zwingli was kept informed of the proceedings and printed pamphlets giving his opinions. It was of little use as the Diet decided against Zwingli. He was to be banned and his writings were no longer to be distributed. Of the thirteen Confederation members, [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], and [[Appenzell]] as well as the Five States voted against Zwingli. [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Canton of Basel|Basel]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]], and [[Canton of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]] supported him.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nThe Baden disputation exposed a deep rift in the Confederation on matters of religion. The Reformation was now emerging in other states. The city of [[St Gallen]], an affiliated state to the Confederation, was led by a reformed mayor, [[Joachim Vadian]], and the city abolished the mass in 1527, just two years after Z\u00fcrich. In Basel, although Zwingli had a close relationship with Oecolampadius, the government did not officially sanction any reformatory changes until 1 April 1529 when the mass was prohibited. Schaffhausen, which had closely followed Z\u00fcrich's example, formally adopted the Reformation in September 1529. In the case of Bern, [[Berchtold Haller]], the priest at [[M\u00fcnster of Berne|St Vincent M\u00fcnster]], and [[Niklaus Manuel]], the poet, painter, and politician, had campaigned for the reformed cause. But it was only after another disputation that Bern counted itself as a canton of the Reformation. Four hundred and fifty persons participated, including pastors from Bern and other cantons as well as theologians from outside the Confederation such as [[Martin Bucer]] and [[Wolfgang Capito]] from [[Strasbourg]], [[Ambrosius Blarer]] from [[Konstanz|Constance]], and [[Andreas Althamer]] from [[Nuremberg]]. Eck and Fabri refused to attend and the Catholic cantons did not send representatives. The meeting started on 6 January 1528 and lasted nearly three weeks. Zwingli assumed the main burden of defending the Reformation and he preached twice in the M\u00fcnster. On 7 February 1528 the council decreed that the Reformation be established in Bern.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=113\u2013119}}</ref>\n\n===First Kappel War (1529)===\n{{Further|First war of Kappel}}\nEven before the Bern disputation, Zwingli was canvassing for an alliance of reformed cities. Once Bern officially accepted the Reformation, a new alliance, ''das Christliche [[Burgrecht]]'' (the Christian Civic Union) was created.<ref>{{Harvnb|Locher|1981|p=109}}. Potter also translates ''Burgrecht'' as \"Civic Union\", while {{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=119}} translates it as \"Fortress Law\".</ref> The first meetings were held in Bern between representatives of Bern, Constance, and Z\u00fcrich on 5\u20136 January 1528. Other cities, including Basel, [[Biel]], [[M\u00fclhausen]], Schaffhausen, and St Gallen, eventually joined the alliance. The Five (Catholic) States felt encircled and isolated, so they searched for outside allies. After two months of negotiations, the Five States formed ''die Christliche Vereinigung'' (the Christian Alliance) with [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]] on 22 April 1529.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=119\u2013120}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=352\u2013355}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bild Zwingli Asper.jpg|thumb|left|1549 painting by [[Hans Asper]]]]\nSoon after the Austrian treaty was signed, a reformed preacher, Jacob Kaiser, was captured in [[Uznach]] and executed in Schwyz. This triggered a strong reaction from Zwingli; he drafted ''Ratschlag \u00fcber den Krieg'' (Advice About the War) for the government. He outlined justifications for an attack on the Catholic states and other measures to be taken. Before Z\u00fcrich could implement his plans, a delegation from Bern that included Niklaus Manuel arrived in Z\u00fcrich. The delegation called on Z\u00fcrich to settle the matter peacefully. Manuel added that an attack would expose Bern to further dangers as Catholic [[Valais]] and the Duchy of Savoy bordered its southern flank. He then noted, \"You cannot really bring faith by means of spears and halberds.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=364}}. In [[Early Modern German]], \"Warlich man mag mit spiess und halberten den glouben nit ingeben.\"</ref> Z\u00fcrich, however, decided that it would act alone, knowing that Bern would be obliged to acquiesce. War was declared on 8 June 1529. Z\u00fcrich was able to raise an army of 30,000 men. The Five States were abandoned by Austria and could raise only 9,000 men. The two forces met near [[Kappel am Albis|Kappel]], but war was averted due to the intervention of Hans Aebli, a relative of Zwingli, who pleaded for an armistice.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=120\u2013121}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=362\u2013367}}</ref>\n\nZwingli was obliged to state the terms of the armistice. He demanded the dissolution of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching by reformers in the Catholic states; prohibition of the pension system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser. Manuel was involved in the negotiations. Bern was not prepared to insist on the unhindered preaching or the prohibition of the pension system. Z\u00fcrich and Bern could not agree and the Five (Catholic) States pledged only to dissolve their alliance with Austria. This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=367\u2013369}}</ref> The first Land Peace of Kappel, ''der erste [[Landfriede]]'', ended the war on 24 June.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=371}}</ref>\n\n===Marburg Colloquy (1529)===\n{{Further|Marburg Colloquy}}\n[[File:Marburger-Religionsgespr\u00e4ch.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coloured [[woodcut]] of the Marburg Colloquy, anonymous, 1557]]\nWhile Zwingli carried on the political work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on the interpretation of the [[eucharist]] originated when [[Andreas Karlstadt]], Luther's former colleague from [[Wittenberg]], published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a [[real presence]] in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including ''de Eucharistia'' (On the Eucharist). He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued that the word ''is'' in the [[Words of Institution|words of the institution]]\u2014\"This is my body, this is my blood\"\u2014means ''signifies''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=157}}</ref> Hence, the words are understood as a metaphor and Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during the eucharist. In effect, the meal was symbolic of the [[Last Supper]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=131\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nBy spring 1527, Luther reacted strongly to Zwingli's views in the treatise ''Dass Diese Worte Christi \"Das ist mein Leib etc.\" noch fest stehen wider die Schwarmgeister'' (That These Words of Christ \"This is My Body etc.\" Still Stand Firm Against the Fanatics). The controversy continued until 1528 when efforts to build bridges between the Lutheran and the Zwinglian views began. [[Martin Butzer|Martin Bucer]] tried to mediate while [[Philip of Hesse]], who wanted to form a political coalition of all Protestant forces, invited the two parties to [[Marburg]] to discuss their differences. This event became known as the [[Marburg Colloquy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=135\u2013136}}</ref>\n\nZwingli accepted Philip's invitation fully believing that he would be able to convince Luther. By contrast, Luther did not expect anything to come out of the meeting and had to be urged by Philip to attend. Zwingli, accompanied by Oecolampadius, arrived on 28 September 1529 with Luther and [[Philipp Melanchthon]] arriving shortly thereafter. Other theologians also participated including Martin Bucer, [[Andreas Osiander]], [[Johannes Brenz]], and [[Justus Jonas]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=251}}</ref> The debates were held from 1\u20133 October and the results were published in the fifteen ''Marburg Articles''. The participants were able to agree on fourteen of the articles, but the fifteenth article established the differences in their views on the presence of Christ in the eucharist. Afterwards, each side was convinced that they were the victors, but in fact the controversy was not resolved and the final result was the formation of two different Protestant confessions.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=136\u2013138}}</ref>\n\n===Politics, confessions, the Kappel Wars, and death (1529\u20131531)===\n{{Further|Second war of Kappel}}\n[[File:Schlacht bei Kappel.jpg|thumb|320px|The [[Second war of Kappel|Battle of Kappel]], 11 October 1531, from ''Chronik'' by [[Johann Stumpf (writer)|Johannes Stumpf]], 1548]]\n[[File:Ermordung Zwingli Jauslin.JPG|thumb|\"The murder of Zwingli\", by [[Karl Jauslin]] (1842\u20131904).]]\nWith the failure of the Marburg Colloquy and the split of the Confederation, Zwingli set his goal on an alliance with [[Philip of Hesse]]. He kept up a lively correspondence with Philip. Bern refused to participate, but after a long process, Z\u00fcrich, Basel, and Strasbourg signed a mutual defence treaty with Philip in November 1530. Zwingli also personally negotiated with France's diplomatic representative, but the two sides were too far apart. France wanted to maintain good relations with the Five States. Approaches to Venice and Milan also failed.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=141\u2013143}}</ref>\n\nAs Zwingli was working on establishing these political alliances, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the [[Augsburg Diet]] to present their views so that he could make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the [[Augsburg Confession]]. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, [[Memmingen]], and [[Lindau]] produced the [[Tetrapolitan Confession]]. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the ''Burgrecht'' cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, ''Fidei ratio'' (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the [[Apostles' Creed]]. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, [[Johann Eck]], counter-attacked with a publication, ''Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor''.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=143\u2013146}}</ref>\n\nWhen Philip of Hesse formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] at the end of 1530, the four cities of the Tetrapolitan Confession joined on the basis of a Lutheran interpretation of that confession. Given the flexibility of the league's entrance requirements, Z\u00fcrich, Basel, and Bern also considered joining. However, Zwingli could not reconcile the Tetrapolitan Confession with his own beliefs and wrote a harsh refusal to Bucer and Capito. This offended Philip to the point where relations with the League were severed. The ''Burgrecht'' cities now had no external allies to help deal with internal Confederation religious conflicts.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=148}}</ref>\n\nThe peace treaty of the First Kappel War did not define the right of unhindered preaching in the Catholic states. Zwingli interpreted this to mean that preaching should be permitted, but the Five States suppressed any attempts to reform. The ''Burgrecht'' cities considered different means of applying pressure to the Five States. Basel and Schaffhausen preferred quiet diplomacy while Z\u00fcrich wanted armed conflict. Zwingli and Jud unequivocally advocated an attack on the Five States. Bern took a middle position which eventually prevailed. In May 1531, Z\u00fcrich reluctantly agreed to impose a food blockade. It failed to have any effect and in October, Bern decided to withdraw the blockade. Z\u00fcrich urged its continuation and the ''Burgrecht'' cities began to quarrel among themselves.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=148\u2013150}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 October 1531, in a surprise move, the Five States declared war on Z\u00fcrich. Z\u00fcrich's mobilisation was slow due to internal squabbling and on 11 October, 3500 poorly deployed men encountered a Five States force nearly double their size near Kappel. Many pastors, including Zwingli, were among the soldiers. The battle lasted less than one hour and Zwingli was among the 500 casualties in the Z\u00fcrich army.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=150\u2013152}}</ref>\n\nZwingli had considered himself first and foremost a soldier of Christ; second a defender of his country, the Confederation; and third a leader of his city, Z\u00fcrich, where he had lived for the previous twelve years. Ironically, he died at the age of 47, not for Christ nor for the Confederation, but for Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=414}}</ref>  \n  \nIn Tabletalk, Luther is recorded saying: \"They say that Zwingli recently died thus; if his error had prevailed, we would have perished, and our church with us. It was a judgment of God. That was always a proud people. The others, the papists, will probably also be dealt with by our Lord God.\"\n.<ref>Luther Works Tabletalk No. 94: God\u2019s Punishment of the Godless (Early November, 1531)</ref> Erasmus wrote, \"We are freed from great fear by the death of the two preachers, Zwingli and [[Oecolampadius]], whose fate has wrought an incredible change in the mind of many.  This is the wonderful hand of God on high.\"  Oecolampadius had died on 24 November.  Erasmus also wrote, \"If [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]] had favoured them, it would have been all over with us.\"<ref>[[Philip Hughes (historian)|Philip Hughes]] (1957), ''A Popular History of the Reformation'', 1960 reprint, Garden City, NY:  Image Books, Ch. 4, \"Luther.

Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. He placed its authority above other sources such as the [[ecumenical councils]] or the [[Church Fathers]], although he did not hesitate to use other sources to support his arguments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> The principles that guide Zwingli's interpretations are derived from his rationalist humanist education and his Reformed understanding of the Bible.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=59}}</ref> He rejected literalist interpretations of a passage, such as those of the Anabaptists, and used [[synecdoche]] <ref>{{citation|last=Yoder|first=John Howard|title=Anabaptism and Reformation in Switzerland: An Historical and Theological Analysis of the Dialogues Between Anabaptists and Reformers|publication-place=Kitchener, Ontario|pages=197\u2013202|year=2004|publisher=Pandora Press|isbn=1-894710-44-4}}</ref> and analogies, methods he describes in ''A Friendly Exegesis'' (1527). Two analogies that he used quite effectively were between baptism and [[circumcision]] and between the eucharist and [[Passover]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=64\u201366}}</ref> He also paid attention to the immediate context and attempted to understand the purpose behind it, comparing passages of scripture with each other.\n\n[[File:Ulrich Zwingli.jpg|thumb|left|A rendition of Huldrych Zwingli from the 1906 edition of the ''[[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]]'']]\nZwingli rejected the word ''sacrament'' in the popular usage of his time. For ordinary people, the word meant some kind of holy action of which there is inherent power to free the conscience from sin. For Zwingli, a sacrament was an initiatory ceremony or a pledge, pointing out that the word was derived from ''sacramentum'' meaning an oath.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=180\u2013185}}</ref> (However, the word is also translated \"mystery\".) In his early writings on baptism, he noted that baptism was an example of such a pledge. He challenged Catholics by accusing them of superstition when they ascribed the water of baptism a certain power to wash away sin. Later, in his conflict with the Anabaptists, he defended the practice of infant baptism, noting that there is no law forbidding the practice. He argued that baptism was a sign of a covenant with God, thereby replacing circumcision in the Old Testament.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=194\u2013206}}</ref>\n\nZwingli approached the eucharist in a similar manner to baptism. During the first Z\u00fcrich disputation in 1523, he denied that an actual sacrifice occurred during the mass, arguing that Christ made the sacrifice only once and for all eternity. Hence, the eucharist was \"a memorial of the sacrifice\".<ref>''Huldreich Zwinglis Samtliche Werke'', Vol. I, 460.6\u201310, as quoted in {{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=219}}</ref> Following this argument, he further developed his view, coming to the conclusion of the \"signifies\" interpretation for the words of the institution. He used various passages of scripture to argue against [[transubstantiation]] as well as Luther's views, the key text being John 6:63, \"It is the Spirit who gives life, the flesh is of no avail\". Zwingli's approach and interpretation of scripture to understand the meaning of the eucharist was one reason he could not reach a consensus with Luther.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=218\u2013250}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of Luther on Zwingli's theological development has long been a source of interest and discussion among Zwinglian scholars. Zwingli himself asserted vigorously his independence of Luther. The most recent studies have lent credibility to this claim, although some scholars still argue his theology was dependent upon Luther's. Zwingli appears to have read Luther's books in search of confirmation from Luther for his own views. Zwingli did, however, admire Luther greatly for the stand he took against the pope. This, more than Luther's theology, was a key influence on Zwingli's convictions as a reformer.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=22}}</ref> What Zwingli considered Luther's courageous stance at the [[Leipzig Disputation]] had a decisive impact on Zwingli during his earliest years as a priest, and during this time Zwingli praised and promoted Luther's writings to support his own similar ideas. Like Luther, Zwingli was also a student and admirer of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=17}}</ref> His later writings continued to show characteristic differences from Luther such as the inclusion of non-Christians in heaven as described in ''An Exposition of the Faith''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=48\u201349}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nZwingli enjoyed music and could play several instruments, including the [[violin]], [[harp]], [[flute]], [[dulcimer]] and [[hunting horn]]. He would sometimes amuse the children of his congregation on his [[lute]] and was so well known for his playing that his enemies mocked him as \"the evangelical lute-player and fifer\". <!-- Aber der gute Zwingli pfiff darauf. ;) --> Three of Zwingli's ''[[Lied]]er'' or hymns have been preserved: the ''Pestlied'' mentioned above, an adaptation of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 65 (c. 1525), and the ''Kappeler Lied'', which is believed to have been composed during the campaign of the first war of Kappel (1529).<ref>Hannes Reimann, ''Huldrych Zwingli \u2013 der Musiker'', Archiv f\u00fcr Musikwissenschaft 17 2./3. (1960), pp. 126\u2013141</ref> These songs were not meant to be sung during worship services and are not identified as hymns of the Reformation, though they were published in some 16th-century hymnals.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=108}}</ref>\n\nZwingli criticised the practice of priestly chanting and monastic choirs. The criticism dates from 1523 when he attacked certain worship practices. His arguments are detailed in the Conclusions of 1525, in which, Conclusions 44, 45 and 46 are concerned with musical practices under the rubric of \"prayer\". He associated music with images and vestments, all of which he felt diverted people's attention from true spiritual worship. It is not known what he thought of the musical practices in early Lutheran churches. Zwingli, however, eliminated instrumental music from worship in the church, stating that God had not commanded it in worship.<ref>Leith, John H, ''Introduction to the Reformed Tradition'', Westminster John Knox Press, {{ISBN|0-8042-0479-9}} pp. 210\u2013211</ref> The organist of the People's Church in Z\u00fcrich is recorded as weeping upon seeing the great organ broken up.<ref name=\"Chadwick439\">Chadwick, Owen, ''The Reformation'', Penguin, 1990, p. 439</ref> Although Zwingli did not express an opinion on congregational singing, he made no effort to encourage it.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=107\u2013108}}</ref> Nevertheless, scholars have found that Zwingli was supportive of a role for music in the church. Gottfried W. Locher writes, \"The old assertion 'Zwingli was against church singing' holds good no longer&nbsp;... Zwingli's polemic is concerned exclusively with the medieval Latin choral and priestly chanting and not with the hymns of evangelical congregations or choirs\". Locher goes on to say that \"Zwingli freely allowed vernacular psalm or choral singing. In addition, he even seems to have striven for lively, antiphonal, unison recitative\". Locher then summarizes his comments on Zwingli's view of church music as follows: \"The chief thought in his conception of worship was always 'conscious attendance and understanding'\u2014'devotion', yet with the lively participation of all concerned\".<ref name=\"zwinglis thought\">{{Harvnb|Locher|1981|pp=61\u201362}}</ref>\n\nThe as of today [[Musikabteilung]] (literally: music departement), located in the choir of the [[Predigerkirche Z\u00fcrich|''Predigern'' church in Z\u00fcrich]] was founded in 1971, being a scientific music collection of European importance. It publishes the materials entrusted to it at irregular intervals as CD's, the repertoire ranges of early 16th-century spiritual music of Huldrych Zwingli's to the late 20th century, published under the label \"Musik aus der Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich\".<ref name=\"musikabteilung-uzh\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zb.uzh.ch/spezialsammlungen/musikabteilung/index.html.de|title=Musikabteilung|publisher=Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-12-25}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Ulrich Zwingli by Asper.jpg|thumb|Painting of Zwingli by [[Hans Asper]]]]\n\nZwingli was a humanist and a scholar with many devoted friends and disciples.

He immediately removed any doubts about Zwingli's orthodoxy and defended him as a prophet and a martyr. During Bullinger's rule, the confessional divisions of the Confederation were stabilised.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=157\u2013158}}</ref> He rallied the reformed cities and cantons and helped them to recover from the defeat at Kappel. Zwingli had instituted fundamental reforms, while Bullinger consolidated and refined them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steinmetz|2001|p=98}}</ref>\n\nScholars have found it difficult to assess Zwingli's impact on history, for several reasons. There is no consensus on the definition of \"Zwinglianism\"; by any definition, Zwinglianism evolved under his successor, Heinrich Bullinger; and research into Zwingli's influence on Bullinger and [[John Calvin]] is still rudimentary.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=155\u2013156}}</ref> Bullinger adopted most of Zwingli's points of doctrine. Like Zwingli, he summarised his theology several times, the best-known being the [[Second Helvetic Confession]] of 1566. Meanwhile, Calvin had taken over the Reformation in [[Geneva]].<ref name=\"Geneva Before Calvin\">{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Herbert Darling|title=Geneva Before Calvin (1387\u20131536).

In 1549, however, Bullinger and Calvin succeeded in overcoming the differences in doctrine and produced the ''[[Consensus Tigurinus]]'' (Z\u00fcrich Consensus). They declared that the eucharist was not just symbolic of the meal, but they also rejected the Lutheran position that the body and blood of Christ is in [[Sacramental union|union with the elements]]. With this rapprochement, Calvin established his role in the [[Swiss Reformed Church]]es and eventually in the wider world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Furcha|1985|pp=179\u2013195}}, J. C.

This research included independent studies by other researchers and a review of over 8,000 studies bearing on early childhood education and the physical and mental development of children.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThey asserted that formal schooling before ages 8\u201312 not only lacked the anticipated effectiveness, but also harmed children. The Moores published their view that formal schooling was damaging young children academically, socially, mentally, and even physiologically. The Moores presented evidence that childhood problems such as juvenile delinquency, nearsightedness, increased enrollment of students in [[special education]] classes and behavioral problems were the result of increasingly earlier enrollment of students.<ref name=\"Moore75\">Better Late Than Early, Raymond S.

They described the difference as follows: \"This is like saying, if you can help a child by taking him off the cold street and housing him in a warm tent, then warm tents should be provided for ''all'' children \u2013 when obviously most children already have even more secure housing.\"<ref name=\"Moore75\" />\n\nLike Holt, the Moores embraced homeschooling after the publication of their first work, ''Better Late Than Early'', in 1975, and became important homeschool advocates and consultants with the publication of books such as ''Home Grown Kids'' (1981), and ''Homeschool Burnout''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nSimultaneously, other authors published books questioning the premises and efficacy of compulsory schooling, including ''Deschooling Society'' by [[Ivan Illich]] in 1970 and ''No More Public School'' by Harold Bennet in 1972.\n\nIn 1976, Holt published ''Instead of Education; Ways to Help People Do Things Better''.

Parental dissatisfaction with available schools typically includes concerns about the school environment, the quality of academic instruction, the curriculum, bullying, racism and lack of faith in the school's ability to cater to their children's [[special needs]]<ref>https://theconversation.com/record-numbers-of-children-are-now-homeschooled-but-whos-keeping-an-eye-on-the-parents-88449</ref>. Some parents homeschool in order to have greater control over what and how their children are taught, to cater more adequately to an individual child's aptitudes and abilities, to provide instruction from a specific [[religious]] or [[moral]] position, and to take advantage of the efficiency of one-to-one instruction and thus allow the child to spend more time on childhood activities, socializing, and non-academic learning.  \n\nSome African-American families choose homeschool as a way of increasing their children's understanding of African-American history \u2013 such as the [[Jim Crow laws]] that resulted in their ancestors being beaten, killed, or sold for [[learning to read]] \u2013 and to limit the harm caused by the unintentional and sometimes subtle [[systemic racism]] that affects most American schools.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/05/black-homeschooling/560636/|title=The Radical Self-Reliance of Black Homeschooling|last=Anderson|first=Melinda D.|date=2018-05-17|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nSome parents have objections to the secular nature of public schools and homeschool in order to give their children a religious education. Use of a religious curriculum is common among these families. Recent sociological work suggests that an increasing number of parents are choosing homeschooling because of low academic quality at the local schools, or because of bullying or health problems.<ref name=\"Reasons Parents Homeschool\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/homeschooling-101/reasons-parents-homeschool/|title=Reasons Parents Homeschool|date=2013-09-11|website=Coalition for Responsible Home Education|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-15}}</ref>\n\nHomeschooling may also be a factor in the choice of [[Parenting styles|parenting style]].  Homeschooling can be a matter of consistency for families living in isolated rural locations, for those temporarily abroad, and for those who travel frequently. Many young athletes, actors, and musicians are taught at home to accommodate their training and practice schedules more conveniently. Homeschooling can be about mentorship and apprenticeship, in which a tutor or teacher is with the child for many years and becomes more intimately acquainted with the child.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Homeschooling increased in popularity in the United States during the 2000s; the percentage of children ages 5 through 17 who were homeschooled increased from 1.7% in 1999 to 3% in 2011/12.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHomeschooling can be used a form of supplemental education and as a way of helping children learn under specific circumstances.

Structured homeschooling includes any method or style of home education that follows a basic curriculum with articulated goals and outcomes. This style attempts to imitate the structure of the traditional school setting while personalizing the curriculum. Unstructured homeschooling is any form of home education where parents do not construct a curriculum at all. Unschooling, as it is known, attempts to teach through the child's daily experiences and focuses more on self-directed learning by the child, free of textbooks, teachers, and any formal assessment of success or failure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Martin-Chang|first1= S.|last2= Gould|first2= O.

Unit studies are useful for teaching multiple grades simultaneously as the difficulty level can be adjusted for each student.

The purchase of a complete curriculum and their teaching/grading service from an accredited distance learning curriculum provider may allow students to obtain an accredited high school diploma.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Unschooling and natural learning===\n\n\"Natural learning\" refers to a type of learning-on-demand where children pursue knowledge based on their interests and parents take an active part in facilitating activities and experiences conducive to learning but do not rely heavily on textbooks or spend much time \"teaching\", looking instead for \"learning moments\" throughout their daily activities. Parents see their role as that of affirming through positive feedback and modeling the necessary skills, and the child's role as being responsible for asking and learning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://education.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-80 |title=Self-Directed Education\u2014Unschooling and Democratic Schooling|work=[[Oxford University Press]]|first=Peter|last=Gray|date=April 15, 2017|accessdate=September 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"[[unschooling]]\" as coined by [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] describes an approach in which parents do not authoritatively direct the child's education, but interact with the child following the child's own interests, leaving them free to explore and learn as their interests lead.<ref name=kwmzdt/><ref name=NCES/> \"Unschooling\" does not indicate that the child is not being educated, but that the child is not being \"schooled\", or educated in a rigid school-type manner. Holt asserted that children learn through the experiences of life, and he encouraged parents to live their lives with their child. Also known as interest-led or child-led learning, unschooling attempts to follow opportunities as they arise in real life, through which a child will learn without coercion. Children at school learn from 1 teacher and 2 auxiliary teachers in a classroom of approximately 30. Kids have the opportunity of dedicated education at home with a ratio of 1 to 1. An unschooled child may utilize texts or classroom instruction, but these are not considered central to education.

They may learn animal husbandry keeping dairy goats or meat rabbits, botany tending a kitchen garden, chemistry to understand the operation of firearms or the internal combustion engine, or politics and local history by following a zoning or historical-status dispute. While any type of homeschoolers may also use these methods, the unschooled child initiates these learning activities. The natural learner participates with parents and others in learning together.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nAnother prominent proponent of unschooling is [[John Taylor Gatto]], author of [[Dumbing Us Down]], The Exhausted School, A Different Kind of Teacher, and [[Weapons of Mass Instruction]]. Gatto argues that public education is the primary tool of \"state controlled consciousness\" and serves as a prime illustration of the [[total institution]] \u2014 a social system which impels obedience to the state and quells free thinking or dissent.<ref>John Taylor Gatto, ''Weapons of Mass Instruction'' (Odysseus Group, 2008).</ref>\n\n===Autonomous learning===\nAutonomous learning is a school of [[education]] which sees learners as individuals who can and should be [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] i.e. be responsible for their own learning climate.\n\nAutonomous education helps students develop their self-consciousness, vision, practicality and freedom of discussion. These attributes serve to aid the student in his/her independent learning. However, a student must not start their autonomous learning completely on their own. It is said, that by first having interaction with someone who has more knowledge in a subject, will speed up the student's learning, and hence allow them to learn more independently.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=L.

In true autonomous learning, the child usually gets to decide what projects they wish to tackle or what interests to pursue. In home education, this can be instead of or in addition to regular subjects like doing math or English.\n\nAccording to Home Education UK the autonomous education philosophy emerged from the [[epistemology]] of [[Karl Popper]] in ''The Myth of the Framework: In Defence of Science and Rationality'', which is developed in the [[Karl Popper debate#Karl Popper debate|debate]]s, which seek to rebut the neo-Marxist social philosophy of convergence proposed by the [[Frankfurt School]]  (e.g. [[Theodor W.

It provides an opportunity for children to learn from other parents who are more specialized in certain areas or subjects. Co-ops also provide social interaction. They may take lessons together or go on field trips. Some co-ops also offer events such as prom and graduation for homeschoolers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://californiahomeschool.net/howTo/highSchool.htm|title=CHN - Homeschool FAQ|website=californiahomeschool.net|access-date=2016-10-05}}</ref>\n\nHomeschoolers are beginning to utilize [[Web 2.0]] as a way to simulate homeschool cooperatives online.

They concluded that the outcome of forcing children into formal schooling is a sequence of \"1) uncertainty as the child leaves the family nest early for a less secure environment, 2) puzzlement at the new pressures and restrictions of the classroom, 3) frustration because unready learning tools \u2013 senses, cognition, brain hemispheres, coordination \u2013 cannot handle the regimentation of formal lessons and the pressures they bring, 4) hyperactivity growing out of nerves and jitter, from frustration, 5)  failure which quite naturally flows from the four experiences above, and 6) delinquency which is failure's twin and apparently for the same reason.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.moorefoundation.com/article.php?id=53|title=Moore Foundation : When Education Becomes Abuse|date=2009-03-31|access-date=2017-08-23|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331150759/http://www.moorefoundation.com/article.php?id=53|archivedate=2009-03-31|df=}}</ref> According to the Moores, \"early formal schooling is burning out our children.

They believe this situation is particularly acute for boys because of their delay in maturity. The Moores cited a Smithsonian Report on the development of genius, indicating a requirement for \"1) much time spent with warm, responsive parents and other adults, 2) very little time spent with peers, and 3) a great deal of free exploration under parental guidance.\" Their analysis suggested that children need \"more of home and less of formal school\", \"more free exploration with... parents, and fewer limits of classroom and books\", and \"more old fashioned chores \u2013 children working with parents \u2013 and less attention to rivalry sports and amusements.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAlong with positive school outcomes, homeschooled youth are also less likely to use and abuse illicit substances and are more likely to disapprove of using alcohol and marijuana.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vaughn|first=Michael G.|last2=Salas-Wright|first2=Christopher P.|last3=Kremer|first3=Kristen P.|last4=Maynard|first4=Brandy R.|last5=Roberts|first5=Greg|last6=Vaughn|first6=Sharon|title=Are homeschooled adolescents less likely to use alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376871615016014|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|volume=155|pages=97\u2013104|doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.08.010|pmc=4652803}}</ref>\n\n==== Debate about outcomes ====\nThere are claims that studies showing that homeschooled students do better on standardized tests<ref name=\"hslda.org\" /><ref name=\"Ray\" /> do not compare with mandatory public-school testing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nBy contrast, SAT and ACT tests are self-selected by homeschooled and formally schooled students alike.

You may wonder why families choose to homeschool. Well, a few reasons reasons as to why is because; it's more of a lifestyle choice, people may choose to home educate so that they can travel and spend quality time with their kids. Children may even learn differently if they are placed in a general crowd surrounded by other kids. They can get bored or can struggle at school, where the teachers are unable to cater for the individuality of each child.\n\nHomeschooling requires government registration, with different requirements from state to state. Some home educators prefer to be regulated, but others question whether the government has any legitimate authority to over-see the choices parents make to raise and educate their children. Curricular help is offered by the Australian Government.\n\nMany organizations exist to help parents and teachers with home education. The HEA (Home Education Association),one of the biggest support organizations, has grown through local support networks. The HEA does not produce educational material, but offers support to families choosing to homeschool.\n\nAnother factor that can tie into the lifestyle choice of families is their religion. According to The Sunday Telegraph, the number of students being homeschooled has nearly doubled since 2014 with approximately 4.479 students partaking in home school education. \u00a0This included reasons for those being, religious disagreements between individuals or just thinking it was better and safer for these kids to be at home. Dan Marshall, professor of education at Penn State states, \"Religious beliefs and values are often cited as the most compelling reasons for home-schooling\". \u00a0Reasons to homeschool due to religion could benefit their child's education or it could not. Families choose to homeschool because \"They are hoping more time with their kids will help give them the foundation they need to keep their faith in God as an adult\" \u00a0On the other hand, \"Some want their children to have more one-on-one attention in their school environment. Some found their children thrive in a homeschool environment, when they were either struggling or not being challenged enough in a public school setting\" \u00a0On December 7th 2017, Australia legalized same sex marriage which had positive and negative outcomes for families of a specific religion. \u00a0Few worried that their child, or children, would suffer harassment and bullying from other students, these parents therefore preferred that their child be \"safer\" and have them homeschooled since there may be situations where one could not afford private school.\n\n\n===Brazil===\nHomeschooling in [[South America]] has not taken hold as it has in North American countries of Canada and the United States.  In 1824, [[Brazil]] permitted home education to take the place of traditional education for nearly 70 years.  In 1990, however, The Statute of Children and Adolescents, or the Estatuto da Crian\u00e7a e Adolescente, prohibited homeschooling and did not recognize it as a legitimate form of education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/homeschooling-in-brazil|title=Homeschooling in Brazil|newspaper=The Brazil Business|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>  A resurgence in the homeschooling movement, however, has encouraged congressman Lincoln Portela to introduce a new bill that would allow children to be educated at home if parents followed state approved guidelines.  The National Association of Home Education was founded in 2010 to achieve these goals. Rough estimates state that around 3,201 families are homeschooling in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/educacao/educacao-domiciliar-ganha-forca-no-brasil-e-busca-legalizacao-7wvulatmkslazdhwncstr7tco|title=Educa\u00e7\u00e3o domiciliar ganha for\u00e7a no Brasil e busca legaliza\u00e7\u00e3o|newspaper=Gazeta do Povo|language=pt-BR|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nHomeschooling is legal in all provinces and territories in Canada and has been for 40 years.

Some provinces have implemented policies that require parents to notify school boards of their decision to homeschool.  Every province requires parents to notify the school system of their intent to withdraw their child from the public school system and to begin home education.  Five of ten provinces additionally require parents to submit a detailed curriculum to the state.  Seven of these provinces do not require the program to be monitored by the school board or other private school administrators, and only five provinces require routine inspection of home education.<ref name=\"Deani Neven Van Pelt 2015\">Deani Neven Van Pelt (2015). Home Schooling in Canada: The Current Picture\u20142015 Edition. Barbara Mitchell Centre for Improvement in Education. Fraser Institute.</ref> These policies, however, are not law; although Canadian legislators recognize the importance of state controls in the homeschooling environment, it is ultimately up to the parent to decide when and how to homeschool.  Despite a positive environment that supports and encourages alternatives to traditional schooling, it is estimated that less than 0.5% of Canadian families were homeschooling in 2015.  This number is probably inaccurate, however, as many parents do not report their decisions to homeschool.<ref name=\"Deani Neven Van Pelt 2015\"/>\n\nUnlike the United States, where homeschooling is largely a consequence of religious conviction, a study of 1,600 families in 2003 found that Canadians primarily choose to homeschool out of a desire to provide better education.  For those children whose parents decided to homeschool out of a desire to better education, a 2003 study found statistical significance between traditionally schooled and homeschooled students scores on standardized tests of writing, reading, and mathematics. A more recent 2011 study found that style of home education (structured versus unstructured) was a more important predictor of standardized test performance than other traditional measures, such as income and parents' educational attainment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flora.org/homeschool-ca/faq.html#journalists|title=Canadian Home Based Learning Resource Page|website=www.flora.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>  These findings are similar to findings in U.S. research on homeschooled children and the outcomes of homeschooling.\n\nOne technique that is specifically Canadian, specifically British Columbian, is the [[Distributed learning|Distributed Learning]] approach to home education.  Distributed Learning is an online program that is directed by a teacher that meets provincial standards for education.  The program draws on public and private curricula. This is distinctive to British Columbia because it is the only province that has Distributed Learning policy.  It is one of the most popular forms of home education.<ref name=\"Deani Neven Van Pelt 2015\"/>\n\n===Israel===\nHomeschooling is legal in Israel, and requires acquiring a permission from the Ministry of Education.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.israelhomeschool.org/faq.htm|title=Israel Home Education\u2014FAQ|date=2016-08-29}}</ref> The permission involves a home visit from the person in charge of handing out the permissions, and writing a letter describing the motives, curriculum, daily routine and socialization of the children. Unschooling is legal, and the requirements are minimal. The reasons for homeschooling in Israel are very similar to those of the rest of the world, with the exception of religious motives, since religious schools are prevalent.\nThere is unclear information regarding the number of Homeschooling families, since not all families ask for permission, and many homeschool their children without enlisting. Estimates range between 500-1000 families.\n\n=== Germany ===\nUp until 1920, homeschooling in [[Germany]] was seen as an acceptable practice under certain circumstances.  With the rise of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], homeschooling was seen as an anti-nationalistic and subversive practice that could undermine children's loyalty to their country.  The Reichsschulpflichtgesetz, implemented in 1938, effectively banned all homeschooling with criminal consequences for anyone found practicing. Homeschooling wouldn't become a public concept until the 1980s.  In 1989, Helmut St\u00fccher removed his children from the public school system to begin home schooling.  St\u00fccher and others who followed suit were fined, and some even lost child custody.<ref>J.D., 2010. HOMESCHOOLING IN GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES. James E. Rogers College of Law The Catholic University of America. Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law.</ref> It wasn't until the unification of Germany in 1990 that education law was reformed and homeschooling was allowed under strict observation and extreme circumstances. Today, however, homeschooling remains illegal.  A 2007 ruling of the German federal court argued that homeschooling was simply another form of child abuse.<ref name=\"german-way.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.german-way.com/homeschooling-verboten/|title=Homeschooling verboten|last=|first=|date=|website=www.german-way.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>\n\nGermany has not endorsed homeschooling as other countries have. Its neighbors, Switzerland and Austria, have embraced the notion and are following similar paths as the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"german-way.com\"/>\n\n=== South Africa ===\n{{Main|Homeschooling in South Africa}}\nHome education was outlawed in South Africa before 1994, and families were jailed for not sending their children to school. With the acceptance of the South African constitution in 1994, home education was legalised per implication. This was acknowledged with promulgation of the SA Schools Act of 1996 in which home education is accommodated in art. 51. Since home education was legalised, it has grown exponentially. According to the census count of 2011, there were about 57 000 home learners in the country, putting South Africa in the top five countries in terms of number of home learners.\n\n=== UK ===\n#REDIRECT [[Home education in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Alternative education]]\n*[[History of education]]\n*[[Homeschooling and alternative education in India]]\n*[[Homeschooling in New Zealand]]\n*[[Homeschooling in the United States]]\n*[[Home education in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Home School Legal Defense Association]]\n*[[Informal learning]]\n*[[List of homeschooling programmes]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n# '''[[#cite%20ref-1|^]]''' <nowiki>http://www.hea.edu.au/</nowiki> \"Home Education Association\"\n# '''[[#cite%20ref-2|^]]''' [<nowiki>https://myaccount.news.com.au/sites/dailytelegraph/subscribe.html?sourceCode=DTWEB_WRE170_a&mode=premium&dest=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/homeschooling-rise-of-50-per-mirrors-rise-in-religious-bullying/news-story/aee60403203dfdd72833d0919c54d3b0?memtype=anonymous</nowiki> \"Religious Bullying Triggers Rise in Homeschooling\"\n# '''[[#cite%20ref-3|^]]''' <nowiki>https://news.psu.edu/story/141246/2005/10/17/research/probing-question-why-do-some-people-choose-homeschool-their-kids</nowiki> \"Why do some people choose to homeschool their kids?\n# '''[[#cite%20ref-4|^]]''' <nowiki>https://www.ulc.org/ulc-blog/connection-religion-homeschooling</nowiki> \"Connection Between Religion and Homeschooling\"\n# '''[[#cite%20ref-5|^]]''' <nowiki>https://www.ulc.org/ulc-blog/connection-religion-homeschooling</nowiki> \"Connection Between Religion and Homeschooling\"\n# '''[[#cite%20ref-6|^]]''' [Joshua Berlinger <nowiki>https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/asia/australia-same-sex-marriage-intl/index.html</nowiki> \"Australia legalizes same-sex marriage\"\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last=Holt |first=John |authorlink=John Holt (educator) |origyear=1976 |year=2004 |title=Instead of Education: Ways to Help People Do Things Better |url= |location=Boulder, CO |publisher=Sentient Publications |isbn=1-59181-009-4 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}{{Wikiquote}}{{wikisource}}\n* [http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-294.html A history of the modern homeschool movement], from the Cato Institute.\n* [http://www.nheri.org/ National Home Education Research Institute] NHERI produces research about homeschooling and sponsors the peer-reviewed academic journal Homeschool Researcher.\n* [http://www.homeschoolaccreditation.com/ The National Independent Study Accreditation Council]\n* [http://www.icher.org/ International Center for Home Education Research Reviews]\n\n{{Homeschooling}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Homeschooling| ]]\n[[Category:School types]]\n[[Category:Home|Schooling]]", "sha1": "26oz2kqwl4ac9efcnen94jpv4r2pqg1"}}, {"title": "Heteroatom", "ns": "0", "id": "13605", "revision": {"id": "866005016", "parentid": "866004603", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T16:59:06Z", "contributor": {"username": "SquisherDa", "id": "12626385"}, "comment": "Call for an article!", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Pyridine.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|Pyridine is a [[heterocyclic compound]] and the heteroatom is nitrogen.]]\nIn [[chemistry]], a '''heteroatom''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''heteros'', \"different\", + ''atomos'', \"uncut\") is, strictly, any [[atom]] that is not [[carbon]] or [[hydrogen]].<ref>{{ cite book | title = Chemistry - An introduction to organic, inorganic and physical chemistry | last1 = Housecroft | first1 = Catherine E. | last2 = Constable | first2 = Edwin C. | year = 2006 | publisher = Prentice Hall | edition = 3rd | isbn = 0131275674 | page = 945}}</ref> \n\nIn practice, the term is usually used more specifically, to indicate that non-carbon atoms have replaced carbon in the backbone of the molecular structure.

The term is commonly used in [[nuclear physics]] to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo, or how long stable atoms survive, [[radioactive decay]]. The term is also used more generally to characterize any type of [[exponential decay|exponential]] or [[rate law|non-exponential]] decay. For example, the medical sciences refer to the [[biological half-life]] of drugs and other chemicals in the human body. The converse of half-life is [[doubling time]].\n\nThe original term, ''half-life period'', dating to [[Ernest Rutherford]]'s discovery of the principle in 1907, was shortened to ''half-life'' in the early 1950s.<ref>John Ayto, ''20th Century Words'' (1989), Cambridge University Press.</ref> Rutherford applied the principle of a radioactive [[chemical element|element's]] half-life to studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of [[radium]] to [[lead-206]].\n\nHalf-life is constant over the lifetime of an exponentially decaying quantity, and it is a [[characteristic unit]] for the exponential decay equation. The accompanying table shows the reduction of a quantity as a function of the number of half-lives elapsed.\n\n== Probabilistic nature ==\n[[File:Halflife-sim.gif|thumb|right|Simulation of many identical atoms undergoing radioactive decay, starting with either 4 atoms per box (left) or 400 (right). The number at the top is how many half-lives have elapsed. Note the consequence of the [[law of large numbers]]: with more atoms, the overall decay is more regular and more predictable.]]\n\nA half-life usually describes the decay of discrete entities, such as radioactive atoms. In that case, it does not work to use the definition that states \"half-life is the time required for exactly half of the entities to decay\". For example, if there is just one radioactive atom, and its half-life is one second, there will ''not'' be \"half of an atom\" left after one second.\n\nInstead, the half-life is defined in terms of [[probability]]: \"Half-life is the time required for exactly half of the entities to decay ''[[expected value|on average]]''\". In other words, the ''probability'' of a radioactive atom decaying within its half-life is 50%.\n\nFor example, the image on the right is a simulation of many identical atoms undergoing radioactive decay. Note that after one half-life there are not ''exactly'' one-half of the atoms remaining, only ''approximately'', because of the random variation in the process. Nevertheless, when there are many identical atoms decaying (right boxes), the [[law of large numbers]] suggests that it is a ''very good approximation'' to say that half of the atoms remain after one half-life.\n\nThere are various simple exercises that demonstrate probabilistic decay, for example involving flipping coins or running a statistical [[computer program]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/Mar2003/1047912974.Ph.r.html | title=Re: What happens durring half lifes &#91;sic&#93; when there is only one atom left?|publisher=MADSCI.org|author=Chivers, Sidney | date=March 16, 2003}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web | url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/radioactive_decay/index.html | title=Radioactive-Decay Model|publisher=Exploratorium.edu | accessdate=2012-04-25}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web| url=http://astro.gmu.edu/classes/c80196/hw2.html| title=Assignment #2: Data, Simulations, and Analytic Science in Decay| publisher=Astro.GLU.edu| date=September 1996| author=Wallin, John| deadurl=bot: unknown| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929005007/http://astro.gmu.edu/classes/c80196/hw2.html| archivedate=2011-09-29| df=}}</ref>\n\n== Formulas for half-life in exponential decay ==\n{{Main|Exponential decay}}\n\nAn exponential decay  can be described by any of the following three equivalent formulas:\n{{block indent|<math>\\begin{align}\n  N(t) &= N_0 \\left(\\frac {1}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{t}{t_{1/2}}} \\\\\n  N(t) &= N_0 e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}} \\\\\n  N(t) &= N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\end{align}</math>}}\nwhere\n* ''N''<sub>0</sub> is the initial quantity of the substance that will decay (this quantity may be measured in grams, moles, number of atoms, etc.),\n* ''N''(''t'') is the quantity that still remains and has not yet decayed after a time ''t'',\n* {{math|''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>}} is the half-life of the decaying quantity,\n* {{mvar|\u03c4}} is a [[positive number]] called the [[mean lifetime]] of the decaying quantity,\n* {{mvar|\u03bb}} is a positive number called the [[decay constant]] of the decaying quantity.\n\nThe three parameters {{math|''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>}}, {{mvar|\u03c4}}, and {{mvar|\u03bb}}  are all directly related in the following way:\n{{block indent|<math>t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln (2)}{\\lambda} = \\tau \\ln(2)</math>}}\nwhere ln(2) is the [[natural logarithm]] of 2 (approximately 0.693).\n\n=== Decay by two or more processes ===\nSome quantities decay by two exponential-decay processes simultaneously. In this case, the actual half-life {{math|''T''<sub>1\u20442</sub>}} can be related to the half-lives ''t''<sub>1</sub> and ''t''<sub>2</sub> that the quantity would have if each of the decay processes acted in isolation:\n:<math>\\frac{1}{T_{1/2}} = \\frac{1}{t_1} + \\frac{1}{t_2}</math>\n\nFor three or more processes, the analogous formula is:\n:<math>\\frac{1}{T_{1/2}} = \\frac{1}{t_1} + \\frac{1}{t_2} + \\frac{1}{t_3} + \\cdots</math>\nFor a proof of these formulas, see [[Exponential decay#Decay by two or more processes|Exponential decay \u00a7 Decay by two or more processes]].\n\n===Examples===\n[[File:Dice_half-life_decay.jpg|thumb|Half life demonstrated using dice in a [[v:Physics and Astronomy Labs/Radioactive decay with dice|classroom experiment]]]]\n{{further|Exponential decay#Applications and examples}}\nThere is a half-life describing any exponential-decay process. For example:\n* The current flowing through an [[RC circuit]] or [[RL circuit]] decays with a half-life of ''RC''ln(2)  or ln(2)''L/R'', respectively. For this example, the term [[half time (physics)|half time]] might be used instead of \"half life\", but they mean the same thing.\n* In a first-order [[chemical reaction]], the half-life of the reactant is  ln(2)/{{mvar|\u03bb}}, where {{mvar|\u03bb}} is the [[reaction rate constant]].\n* In [[radioactive decay]], the half-life is the length of time after which there is a 50% chance that an atom will have undergone [[Atomic nucleus|nuclear]] decay. It varies depending on the atom type and [[isotope]], and is usually determined experimentally. See [[List of nuclides]].\n* The half life of a species is the time it takes for the concentration of the substance to fall to half of its initial value.\n\n==In non-exponential decay==\nThe term \"half-life\" is almost exclusively used for decay processes that are exponential (such as radioactive decay or the other examples above), or approximately exponential (such as [[biological half-life]] discussed below). In a decay process that is not even close to exponential, the half-life will change dramatically while the decay is happening. In this situation it is generally uncommon to talk about half-life in the first place, but sometimes people will describe the decay in terms of its \"first half-life\", \"second half-life\", etc., where the first half-life is defined as the time required for decay from the initial value to 50%, the second half-life is from 50% to 25%, and so on.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chemistry for the Biosciences: The Essential Concepts |authors=Jonathan Crowe, Tony Bradshaw |page=568 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VxMNBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA568|isbn=9780199662883 |year=2014 }}</ref>\n\n== In biology and pharmacology ==\n{{also|Biological half-life}}\nA biological half-life or elimination half-life is the time it takes for a substance (drug, radioactive nuclide, or other) to lose one-half of its pharmacologic, physiologic, or radiological activity.

Humus is different from decomposing soil organic matter. The latter looks rough and has visible  remains of the original plant or animal matter. Fully humified humus, on the contrary, has a uniformly dark, spongy, and jelly-like appearance, and is amorphous; it may gradually decompose over several years or persist for millennia.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite journal | last1 = Di Giovanni1 | first1 = C. | last2 = Disnar | first2 = J.R. | last3 = Bichet | first3 = V. | last4 = Campy | first4 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Sur la pr\u00e9sence de mati\u00e8res organiques m\u00e9soc\u00e9nozo\u00efques dans des humus actuels (bassin de Chaillexon, Doubs, France) | url = | journal = Comptes Rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, S\u00e9rie IIA | volume = 326 | issue = 8| pages = 553\u2013559 | doi = 10.1016/S1251-8050(98)80206-1 | bibcode = 1998CRASE.326..553D }}</ref> It has no determinate shape, structure,  or quality.

This process is termed \"[[mineralization (soil science)|mineralization]]\". In this process, [[nitrogen]] ([[nitrogen cycle]]) and the other nutrients ([[nutrient cycle]]) in the decomposed organic matter are recycled. Depending on the conditions in which the decomposition occurs, a fraction of the organic matter does not mineralize, and instead is transformed by a process called \"humification\" into concatenations of organic [[polymer]]s. Because these organic [[polymer]]s are resistant to the action of [[microorganism]]s, they are stable, and constitute ''humus''. This stability implies that humus integrates into the permanent structure of the soil, thereby improving it.<ref name=\"Brady\">{{cite book|last1=Brady|first1=N. C.|last2=Weil|first2=R.

In a discrete water molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.  Two molecules of [[water]] can form a hydrogen bond between them that is to say [[oxygen-hydrogen bonding]]; the simplest case, when only two molecules are present, is called the [[water dimer]] and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the [[crystal structure]] of [[ice]], helping to create an open hexagonal lattice. The density of ice is less than the density of water at the same temperature; thus, the solid phase of water floats on the liquid, unlike most other substances.\n\n[[Liquid]] water's high [[boiling point]] is due to the high number of hydrogen bonds each molecule can form, relative to its low [[molecular mass]]. Owing to the difficulty of breaking these bonds, water has a very high boiling point, melting point, and viscosity compared to otherwise similar liquids not conjoined by hydrogen bonds. Water is unique because its oxygen atom has two lone pairs and two hydrogen atoms, meaning that the total number of bonds of a water molecule is up to four.\n\nThe number of hydrogen bonds formed by a molecule of liquid water fluctuates with time and temperature.<ref name=\"Jorgensen1985\"/>   From [[water model|TIP4P]] liquid water simulations at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, it was estimated that each water molecule  participates in an average of 3.59 hydrogen bonds.

For example, the double helical structure of [[DNA]] is due largely to hydrogen bonding between its [[base pair]]s (as well as [[pi stacking]] interactions), which link one complementary strand to the other and enable [[DNA replication|replication]].\n\n===Proteins===\nIn the [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure of proteins]], hydrogen bonds form between the backbone oxygens and [[amide]] hydrogens.  When the spacing of the [[amino acid]] residues participating in a hydrogen bond occurs regularly between positions ''i'' and ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;4, an [[alpha helix]] is formed.  When the spacing is less, between positions ''i'' and ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;3, then a [[3 10 helix|3<sub>10</sub> helix]] is formed. When two strands are joined by hydrogen bonds involving alternating residues on each participating strand, a [[beta sheet]] is formed. Hydrogen bonds also play a part in forming the tertiary structure of protein through interaction of R-groups. (See also [[protein folding]]).\n\n[[Bifurcated H-bond]] systems are common in alpha-helical [[transmembrane proteins]] between the backbone amide C=O of residue ''i'' as the H-bond acceptor and two H-bond donors from residue ''i+4'': the backbone amide N-H and a side-chain hydroxyl or thiol H<sup>+</sup>. The energy preference of the bifurcated H-bond hydroxyl or thiol system is -3.4 kcal/mol or -2.6 kcal/mol, respectively. This type of bifurcated H-bond provides an intrahelical H-bonding partner for polar side-chains, such as [[serine]], [[threonine]], and [[cysteine]] within the hydrophobic membrane environments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Feldblum|first=Esther S.|author2=Arkin, Isaiah T.|title=Strength of a bifurcated H bond|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2014|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/02/26/1319827111|doi=10.1073/pnas.1319827111|pmid=24591597}}</ref>\n\nThe role of hydrogen bonds in protein folding has also been linked to osmolyte-induced protein stabilization. Protective osmolytes, such as [[trehalose]] and [[sorbitol]], shift the protein folding equilibrium toward the folded state, in a concentration dependent manner. While the prevalent explanation for osmolyte action relies on excluded volume effects that are entropic in nature, recent [[circular dichroism]] (CD) experiments have shown osmolyte to act through an enthalpic effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Politi|first=Regina|author2=Harries, Daniel|title=Enthalpically driven peptide stabilization by protective osmolytes|journal=ChemComm|year=2010|volume=46|pages=6449\u20136451|doi=10.1039/C0CC01763A|pmid=20657920|issue=35}}</ref> The molecular mechanism for their role in protein stabilization is still not well established, though several mechanisms have been proposed.

However, washing at high temperatures can permanently break the hydrogen bonds and a garment may permanently lose its shape.\n\n===Cellulose===\nHydrogen bonds are important in the structure of [[cellulose]] and derived polymers in its many different forms in nature, such as such as [[cotton]] and [[flax]].\n\n[[Image:Kevlar chemical structure.png|thumb|400px|Para-aramid structure]]\n[[Image:Cellulose strand.svg|thumb|right|260px|A strand of cellulose (conformation I<sub>&alpha;</sub>), showing the hydrogen bonds (dashed) within and between cellulose molecules]]\n\n===Synthetic polymers===\nMany [[polymer]]s are strengthened by hydrogen bonds within and between the chains. Among the [[synthetic polymer]]s, a well characterized example is [[nylon]], where hydrogen bonds occur in the [[repeat unit]] and play a major role in [[crystallization]] of the material. The bonds occur between [[carbonyl]] and [[amine]] groups in the [[amide]] repeat unit. They effectively link adjacent chains, which help reinforce the material. The effect is great in [[aramid]] [[fibre]], where hydrogen bonds stabilize the linear chains laterally. The chain axes are aligned along the fibre axis, making the fibres extremely stiff and strong.\n\nThe hydrogen-bond networks make both natural and synthetic polymers sensitive to [[humidity]] levels in the atmosphere because water molecules can diffuse into the surface and disrupt the network. Some polymers are more sensitive than others. Thus [[nylon]]s are more sensitive than [[aramid]]s, and [[nylon 6]] more sensitive than [[nylon-11]].\n\n==Symmetric hydrogen bond==\nA [[symmetric hydrogen bond]] is a special type of hydrogen bond in which the proton is spaced exactly halfway between two identical atoms. The strength of the bond to each of those atoms is equal. It is an example of a [[three-center four-electron bond]]. This type of bond is much stronger than a \"normal\" hydrogen bond. The effective bond order is 0.5, so its strength is comparable to a covalent bond. It is seen in ice at high pressure, and also in the solid phase of many anhydrous acids such as [[hydrofluoric acid]] and [[formic acid]] at high pressure. It is also seen in the [[bifluoride]] ion [F\u2212H\u2212F]<sup>\u2212</sup>.\n\nSymmetric hydrogen bonds have been observed recently spectroscopically in [[formic acid]] at high pressure (>GPa). Each hydrogen atom forms a partial covalent bond with two atoms rather than one. Symmetric hydrogen bonds have been postulated in ice at high pressure ([[Ice X]]). [[Low-barrier hydrogen bond]]s form when the distance between two heteroatoms is very small.\n\n==Dihydrogen bond==\n[[File:NTCDI AFM2a.jpg|thumb|[[Non-contact atomic force microscopy|AFM]] image of [[napthalenetetracarboxylic diimide]] molecules on silver-terminated silicon, interacting via hydrogen bonding, taken at 77 \u2009K.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ncomms4931|title=Mapping the force field of a hydrogen-bonded assembly|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5|pages=3931|year=2014|last1=Sweetman|first1=A.

Merriam Company]], Cambridge, Massachusetts (1961).</ref>  Armory, the best-known branch of heraldry, concerns the design and transmission of the [[achievement (heraldry)|heraldic achievement]], more commonly known as the [[coat of arms]]. The coat of arms usually includes a [[escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]], [[helmet (heraldry)|helmet]], and [[Crest (heraldry) |crest]], together with any accompanying devices, such as [[supporter]]s, [[heraldic badge|badges]], [[heraldic flag|heraldic banners]], and [[motto]]es.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 1, 57\u201359.</ref>\n\nAlthough the use of various devices to signify individuals and groups goes back to [[ancient history|antiquity]], both the form and use of such devices varied widely, and the concept of regular, hereditary designs, constituting the distinguishing feature of heraldry, did not develop until the [[High Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"CGH 1\u201318\">Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 1\u201318.</ref> The use of helmets with face guards during this period made it difficult to recognize one's commanders in the field when large armies gathered together for extended periods, necessitating the development of heraldry as a symbolic language.<ref name=\"CGH 1\u201318\"/><ref>[[John Brooke-Little]], ''An Heraldic Alphabet'', Macdonald, London (1973), p. 2.</ref>\n\nThe beauty and pageantry of heraldic designs allowed them to survive the gradual abandonment of armour on the battlefield during the seventeenth century.  Heraldry has been described poetically as \"the handmaid of history\",<ref>S. T. Aveling, ''Heraldry: Ancient and Modern, including Boutell's Heraldry,'' Frederick Warne and Company, London and New York (1890), p. 5.</ref> \"the shorthand of history\",<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. v.</ref> and \"the floral border in the garden of history\".<ref>[[Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk]] & [[Don Pottinger|Pottinger]], ''Simple Heraldry'', Thomas Nelson (1953).</ref>  In modern times, individuals, public and private organizations, corporations, cities, towns, and regions use heraldry and its conventions to symbolize their heritage, achievements, and aspirations.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 19\u201326.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Precursors===\nVarious symbols have been used to represent individuals or groups for thousands of years.  The earliest representations of distinct persons and regions in [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] art show the use of standards topped with the images or symbols of various gods, and the names of kings appear upon emblems known as [[serekh]]s, representing the king's palace, and usually topped with a falcon representing the god [[Horus]], of whom the king was regarded as the earthly incarnation.  Similar emblems and devices are found in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n art of the same period, and the precursors of heraldic beasts such as the [[griffin]] can also be found.<ref name=\"CGH 1\u201318\"/>  In the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Numbers]] refers to the standards and ensigns of the [[Israelites|children of Israel]], who were commanded to gather beneath these emblems and declare their pedigrees.<ref>[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], i. 2, 18, 52; ii. 2, 34; quoted by William Sloane Sloane-Evans, in ''A Grammar of British Heraldry'', John Russell Smith, London (1854), p. ix (quoted by Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 6).</ref>  The Greek and Latin writers frequently describe the shields and symbols of various heroes,<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 6\u201310.</ref> and units of the Roman army were sometimes identified by distinctive markings on their shields.<ref>''Notitia Dignitatum'', Bodleian Library</ref>\n\nUntil the nineteenth century, it was common for heraldic writers to cite examples such as these, and metaphorical symbols such as the \"Lion of Judah\" or \"Eagle of the Caesars\" as evidence of the antiquity of heraldry itself; and to infer therefrom that the great figures of ancient history bore arms representing their noble status and descent.  The [[Book of Saint Albans]], compiled in 1486, declares that Christ himself was a gentleman of coat armour.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 6.</ref>  But these fabulous claims have long since been dismissed as the fantasy of medieval heralds, for there is no evidence of a distinctive symbolic language akin to that of heraldry during this early period; nor do many of the shields described in antiquity bear a close resemblance to those of medieval heraldry; nor is there any evidence that specific symbols or designs were passed down from one generation to the next, representing a particular person or line of descent.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 11\u201316.</ref>\n\nThe medieval heralds also [[attributed arms|devised arms]] for various knights and lords from history and literature.  Notable examples include the toads attributed to [[Pharamond]], the cross and martlets of [[Edward the Confessor]], and the various arms attributed to the [[Nine Worthies]] and the Knights of the [[Round Table]].  These too are now regarded as a fanciful invention, rather than evidence of the antiquity of heraldry.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Narmer Palette serpopard side.jpg|Reverse of the [[Narmer Palette]], ''circa'' 3100 BC.

Although certain designs that are now considered heraldic were evidently in use during the eleventh century, most accounts and depictions of shields up to the beginning of the twelfth century contain little or no evidence of their heraldic character.  For example, the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], illustrating the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] of England in 1066, and probably commissioned about 1077, when the cathedral of Bayeux was rebuilt,{{efn-lr|This was undertaken by Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and half-brother of William I, whose conquest of England is commemorated by the tapestry.}} depicts a number of shields of various shapes and designs, many of which are plain, while others are decorated with dragons, crosses, or other typically heraldic figures.  Yet no individual is depicted twice bearing the same arms, nor are any of the descendants of the various persons depicted known to have borne devices resembling those in the tapestry.<ref>John Woodward and George Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry: British and Foreign'', W. & A. K. Johnson, Edinburgh and London (1892), vol. 1, pp. 29\u201331.</ref><ref name=\"CGH 14\u201316\">Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 14\u201316.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, an account of the French knights at the court of the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius I]] at the beginning of the twelfth century describes their shields of polished metal, utterly devoid of heraldic design.  A Spanish manuscript from 1109 describes both plain and decorated shields, none of which appears to have been heraldic.<ref name=\"ToH 26\">Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 26.</ref>  The [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] contained a window commemorating the knights who embarked on the [[Second Crusade]] in 1147, and was probably made soon after the event; but [[Bernard de Montfaucon|Montfaucon's]] illustration of the window before it was destroyed shows no heraldic design on any of the shields.<ref name=\"CGH 14\u201316\"/><ref>Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 31.</ref>\n\nIn England, from the time of the Norman conquest, official documents had to be sealed.  Beginning in the twelfth century, seals assumed a distinctly heraldic character; a number of seals dating from between 1135 and 1155 appear to show the adoption of heraldic devices in England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.<ref>[[Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|Thomas Woodcock]] & [[John Martin Robinson]], ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry'', Oxford University Press, New York (1988), p. 1.</ref>  A notable example of an early armorial seal is attached to a charter granted by [[Philip I, Count of Flanders]], in 1164.  Seals from the latter part of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries show no evidence of heraldic symbolism, but by the end of the twelfth century, seals are uniformly heraldic in nature.<ref name=\"ToH 26\"/><ref>Wagner, ''Heraldry in England'', p. 8.</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest known examples of armory as it subsequently came to be practiced can be seen on the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], who died in 1151.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 62.</ref>  An enamel, probably commissioned by Geoffrey's widow between 1155 and 1160, depicts him carrying a blue shield decorated with six golden lions rampant.{{efn-lr|Only four lions are visible in this depiction, in which the shield is shown in profile, but judging from their position, there must have been six; the tomb of Geoffrey's grandson, William Longsp\u00e9e, shows him bearing an apparently identical shield, but on this all six lions are at least partly visible.}}  He wears a blue helmet adorned with another lion, and his cloak is lined in vair.  A medieval chronicle states that Geoffrey was given a shield of this description when he was knighted by his father-in-law, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], in 1128; but this account probably dates to about 1175.<ref>C. A. Stothard, ''Monumental Effigies of Great Britain'' (1817) pl. 2, illus. in Anthony Wagner, Richmond Herald, ''Heraldry in England'', Penguin (1946), pl. I.</ref><ref>[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''Heraldry: An Introduction to a Noble Tradition'', Thames and Hudson Ltd. (1997), p. 18.</ref>\n\nThe earlier heraldic writers attributed the lions of England to [[William the Conqueror]], but the earliest evidence of the association of lions with the English crown is a seal bearing two lions passant, used by the future [[John, King of England|King John]] during the lifetime of his father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who died in 1189.<ref>Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 32.</ref><ref name=\"CGH 173\u2013174\">Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 173\u2013174.</ref>  Since Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, it seems reasonable to suppose that the adoption of lions as an heraldic emblem by Henry or his sons might have been inspired by Geoffrey's shield.  John's elder brother, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], who succeeded his father on the throne, is believed to have been the first to have borne the arms of three lions passant-guardant, still the arms of England, having earlier used two lions rampant combatant, which arms may also have belonged to his father.<ref>Pastoureau, p. 59.</ref>  Richard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a lion statant (now statant-guardant).<ref name=\"CGH 173\u2013174\"/><ref>Woodward and Burnett, p. 37.</ref>\n\nThe origins of heraldry are sometimes associated with the [[Crusades]], a series of military campaigns undertaken by Christian armies from 1096 to 1487, with the goal of reconquering Jerusalem and other former Byzantine territories captured by Muslim forces during the seventh century.  While there is no evidence that heraldic art originated in the course of the Crusades, there is no reason to doubt that the gathering of large armies, drawn from across Europe for a united cause, would have encouraged the adoption of armorial bearings as a means of identifying one's commanders in the field, or that it helped disseminate the principles of armory across Europe.  At least two distinctive features of heraldry are generally accepted as products of the crusaders: the surcoat, an outer garment worn over the armor to protect the wearer from the heat of the sun, was often decorated with the same devices that appeared on a knight's shield.  It is from this garment that the phrase \"coat of arms\" is derived.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17\u201318.</ref>  Also the lambrequin, or mantling, that depends from the helmet and frames the shield in modern heraldry, began as a practical covering for the helmet and the back of the neck during the Crusades, serving much the same function as the surcoat.  Its slashed or scalloped edge, today rendered as billowing flourishes, is thought to have originated from hard wearing in the field, or as a means of deadening a sword blow and perhaps entangling the attacker's weapon.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17\u201318, 383.</ref>\n\n===Heralds and heraldic authorities===\nThe spread of armorial bearings across Europe soon gave rise to a new occupation: the [[herald]], originally a type of messenger employed by noblemen, assumed the responsibility of learning and knowing the rank, pedigree, and heraldic devices of various knights and lords, as well as the rules and protocols governing the design and description, or ''blazoning'' of arms, and the precedence of their bearers.<ref name=\"CGH 27\u201329\">Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 27\u201329.</ref>  As early as the late thirteenth century, certain heralds in the employ of monarchs were given the title \"King of Heralds\", which eventually became \"[[King of Arms]].\"<ref name=\"CGH 27\u201329\"/>\n\n[[File:Pursuivant.JPG|thumb|left|Two pursuivants wearing [[tabard]]s, [[Windsor Castle]], 2006.]]\nIn the earliest period, arms were assumed by their bearers without any need for heraldic authority.  However, by the middle of the fourteenth century, the principle that only a single individual was entitled to bear a particular coat of arms was generally accepted, and disputes over the ownership of arms seems to have led to gradual establishment of heraldic authorities to regulate their use.  The earliest known work of [[Law of Arms|heraldic jurisprudence]], ''De Insigniis et Armis'', was written about 1350 by [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato]], a professor of law at the [[University of Padua]].<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/bartolo.htm ''De Insigniis et Armis'']</ref><ref>George Squibb, \"The Law of Arms in England\", in ''The Coat of Arms'' vol. II, no. 15 (Spring 1953), p. 244.</ref>  The most celebrated armorial dispute in English heraldry is that of ''[[Scrope v Grosvenor]]'' (1390), in which two different men claimed the right to bear ''azure, a bend or''.<ref name=\"CGH 21\u201322\">Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 21\u201322.</ref>  The continued proliferation of arms, and the number of disputes arising from different men assuming the same arms, led [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] to issue a proclamation in 1419, forbidding all those who had not borne arms at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] from assuming arms, except by inheritance or a grant from the crown.<ref name=\"CGH 21\u201322\"/><ref>Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, pp. 35\u201336.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the reign of [[Henry VIII]], the Kings of Arms were commanded to make ''[[heraldic visitation|visitations]]'', in which they traveled about the country, recording arms borne under proper authority, and requiring those who bore arms without authority either to obtain authority for them, or cease their use.  Arms borne improperly were to be taken down and defaced.  The first such visitation began in 1530, and the last was carried out in 1700, although no new commissions to carry out visitations were made after the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1689.<ref name=\"CGH 21\u201322\"/><ref>Julian Franklyn, ''Shield and Crest: An Account of the Art and Science of Heraldry'', MacGibbon & Kee, London (1960), p. 386.</ref>\n\nIn 1484, during the reign of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the various heralds employed by the crown were incorporated into the [[College of Arms]], through which all new grants of arms would eventually be issued.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 38.</ref><ref name=\"Pastoureau 39\u201341\">Pastoureau, pp. 39\u201341.</ref>  The college currently consists of three Kings of Arms, assisted by six Heralds, and four [[Pursuivants]], or junior officers of arms, all under the authority of the [[Earl Marshal]]; but all of the arms granted by the college are granted by the authority of the crown.<ref name=\"CoA Official Site\">[http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/about-us/heralds-officers College of Arms official website], accessed 3 March 2016.</ref>  Similar bodies regulate the granting of arms in other monarchies and several members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but in most other countries there is no heraldic authority, and no law preventing anyone from assuming whatever arms they please, provided that they do not infringe upon the arms of another.<ref name=\"Pastoureau 39\u201341\"/>\n\n===Later uses and developments===\nAlthough heraldry originated from military necessity, it soon found itself at home in the pageantry of the [[tournament (medieval)|medieval tournament]].  The opportunity for knights and lords to display their heraldic bearings in a competitive medium led to further refinements, such as the development of elaborate tournament helms, and further popularized the art of heraldry throughout Europe.  Prominent burghers and corporations, including many cities and towns, assumed or obtained grants of arms, with only nominal military associations.<ref>Peter Gwynn-Jones, ''The Art of Heraldry: Origins, Symbols, and Designs'', Parkgate Books/Barnes & Noble (1998), pp. 18\u201320.</ref>  Heraldic devices were depicted in various contexts, such as religious and funerary art, and in using a wide variety of media, including stonework, carved wood, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[stained glass]], and [[embroidery]].<ref>Ottfried Neubecker, ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'', Macdonald and James Publishers (1977), pp. 253\u2013258.</ref>\n\nAs the rise of firearms rendered the mounted knight increasingly irrelevant on the battlefield during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and the tournament faded into history, the military character of heraldry gave way to its use as a decorative art.  Freed from the limitations of actual shields and the need for arms to be easily distinguished in combat, heraldic artists designed increasingly elaborate achievements, culminating in the development of \"landscape heraldry\", incorporating realistic depictions of landscapes, during the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century.  These fell out of fashion during the mid-nineteenth century, when a renewed interest in the history of armory led to the re-evaluation of earlier designs, and a new appreciation for the medieval origins of the art.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 87\u201388.</ref><ref>Gwynn-Jones, pp. 110\u2013112.</ref>  Since the late nineteenth century, heraldry has focused on the use of varied lines of partition and little-used ordinaries to produce new and unique designs.<ref>Gwynn-Jones, pp. 113\u2013121.</ref>\n\n==Heraldic achievement==\n\n===Elements of an achievement===\n{{COA elements}}\nAn heraldic achievement consists of a [[escutcheon (heraldry)|shield of arms]], together with all of its accompanying elements, such as a [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], [[supporter]]s, and other heraldic embellishments.  The term \"[[coat of arms]]\" technically refers to the shield of arms itself, but the phrase is commonly used to refer to the entire achievement.  The one indispensable element of a coat of arms is the shield; many ancient coats of arms consist of nothing else, but no coat of arms exists without a shield.<ref name=\"CGH 57\u201359\">Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 57\u201359.</ref>\n\nFrom a very early date, illustrations of arms were frequently embellished with [[helmet (heraldry)|helmets]] placed above the shields.  These in turn came to be decorated with fan-shaped or sculptural crests, often incorporating elements from the shield of arms; as well as a wreath or [[torse]], or sometimes a [[coronet]], from which depended the lambrequin or [[mantling]].  To these elements, modern heraldry often adds a [[motto]] displayed on a ribbon, typically below the shield.  The helmet is borne of right, and forms no part of a grant of arms; it may be assumed without authority by anyone entitled to bear arms, together with mantling and whatever motto the armiger may desire.  The crest, however, together with the torse or coronet from which it arises, must be granted or confirmed by the relevant heraldic authority.<ref name=\"CGH 57\u201359\"/>\n\nIf the bearer is entitled to the ribbon, collar, or badge of a knightly order, it may encircle or depend from the shield.  Some arms, particularly those of the nobility, are further embellished with supporters, heraldic figures standing alongside or behind the shield; often these stand on a [[compartment (heraldry)|compartment]], typically a mound of earth and grass, on which other [[heraldic badge|badges]], symbols, or [[heraldic flag|heraldic banners]] may be displayed.  The most elaborate achievements sometimes display the entire coat of arms beneath a pavilion, an embellished tent or canopy of the type associated with the medieval tournament.<ref name=\"CGH 57\u201359\"/>\n\n====Shield====\n{{main article|Escutcheon (heraldry)}}\nThe primary element of an heraldic achievement is the shield, or escutcheon, upon which the coat of arms is depicted.{{efn-lr|Note that the term \"coat of arms\" is sometimes used to refer to the entire achievement, of which the shield is the central part.}}  All of the other elements of an achievement are designed to decorate and complement these arms, but only the shield of arms is required.<ref name=\"CGH 57\u201361\">Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 57, 60\u201361.</ref><ref>Aveling, ''Boutell's Heraldry'', p. 6.</ref><ref>William Whitmore, ''The Elements of Heraldry'', Weathervane Books, New York (1968), p. 9.</ref>  The shape of the shield, like many other details, is normally left to the discretion of the heraldic artist,{{efn-lr|There are exceptions to this rule, in which the shape of the escutcheon is specified in the blazon; for example, the [[coat of arms of Nunavut|arms of Nunavut]],<ref>Government of Nunavut. n.d.

Sometimes an oval shield, or cartouche, was substituted for the lozenge; this shape was also widely used for the arms of clerics in French, Spanish, and Italian heraldry, although it was never reserved for their use.<ref name=\"CGH 57\u201361\"/><ref name=\"Woodward 54\u201358\"/>  In recent years, the use of the cartouche for women's arms has become general in Scottish heraldry, while both Scottish and Irish authorities have permitted a traditional shield under certain circumstances, and in Canadian heraldry the shield is now regularly granted.<ref>Slater, p. 231.</ref>\n\nThe whole surface of the escutcheon is termed the [[field (heraldry)|field]], which may be plain, consisting of a single tincture, or divided into multiple sections of differing tinctures by various lines of partition; and any part of the field may be ''sem\u00e9'', or powdered with small charges.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 89, 96\u201398.</ref>  The edges and adjacent parts of the escutcheon are used to identify the placement of various heraldic charges; the upper edge, and the corresponding upper third of the shield, are referred to as the chief; the lower part is the base.  The sides of the shield are known as the dexter and sinister flanks, although it is important to note that these terms are based on the point of view of the bearer of the shield, who would be standing behind it; accordingly the side which is to the bearer's right is the dexter, and the side to the bearer's left is the sinister, although to the observer, and in all heraldic illustration, the dexter is on the left side, and the sinister on the right.<ref name=\"Boutell 8\">Aveling, ''Boutell's Heraldry'', p. 8.</ref><ref name=\"Woodward 59\u201360\">Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, pp. 59\u201360.</ref><ref name=\"CGH 104\u2013105\">Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 104\u2013105.</ref>\n\nThe placement of various charges may also refer to a number of specific points, nine in number according to some authorities, but eleven according to others.

These are divided into three categories, known as ''metals'', ''colours'', and ''furs''.{{efn-lr|Technically, the word ''tincture'' applies specifically to the colours, rather than to the metals or the furs; but for lack of another term including all three, it is regularly used in this extended sense.}}<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 70.</ref>\n\nThe metals are ''or'' and ''argent'', representing gold and silver, respectively, although in practice they are usually depicted as yellow and white.  Five colours are universally recognized: ''gules'', or red; ''sable'', or black; ''azure'', or blue; ''vert'', or green; and ''purpure'', or purple; and most heraldic authorities also admit two additional colours, known as ''sanguine'' or ''murrey'', a dark red or mulberry colour between gules and purpure, and ''tenn\u00e9'', an orange or dark yellow to brown colour.  These last two are quite rare, and are often referred to as ''stains'', from the belief that they were used to represent some dishonourable act, although in fact there is no evidence that this use existed outside the imagination of the more fanciful heraldic writers.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 70\u201374.</ref>  Perhaps owing to the realization that there is really no such thing as a ''stain'' in genuine heraldry, as well as the desire to create new and unique designs, the use of these colours for general purposes has become accepted in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{efn-lr|For instance, the arms of Lewes Old Grammar School, granted October 25, 2012: \"Murrey within an Orle of eight Crosses crosslet Argent a Lion rampant Or holding in the forepaws a Book bound Azure the spine and the edges of the pages Gold\" and those of Woolf, granted October 2, 2015: \"Murrey a Snow Wolf's Head erased proper on a Chief Argent a Boar's Head coped at the neck between two Fleurs de Lys Azure.\"}}<ref name=\"CoA Official Site\"/>  Occasionally one meets with other colours, particularly in continental heraldry, although they are not generally regarded among the standard heraldic colours.  Among these are ''cendr\u00e9e'', or ash-colour; ''brun\u00e2tre'', or brown; ''bleu-c\u00e9leste'' or ''bleu de ciel'', sky blue; ''amaranth'' or ''columbine'', a bright violet-red or pink colour; and ''carnation'', commonly used to represent flesh in French heraldry.<ref>Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, pp. 61\u201362.</ref><ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 74.</ref>  A more recent addition is the use of ''copper'' as a metal in one or two Canadian coats of arms.\n\nThere are two basic types of heraldic fur, known as [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] and [[vair]], but over the course of centuries each has developed a number of variations.  Ermine represents the fur of the [[stoat]], a type of weasel, in its white winter coat, when it is called an ermine.  It consists of a white, or occasionally silver field, powdered with black figures known as ''ermine spots'', representing the black tip of the animal's tail.  Ermine was traditionally used to line the cloaks and caps of the nobility.  The shape of the heraldic ermine spot has varied considerably over time, and nowadays is typically drawn as an arrowhead surmounted by three small dots, but older forms may be employed at the artist's discretion.  When the field is sable and the ermine spots argent, the same pattern is termed ''ermines''; when the field is ''or'' rather than argent, the fur is termed ''erminois''; and when the field is sable and the ermine spots ''or'', it is termed ''pean''.<ref>Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 63.</ref><ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 77\u201379.</ref>\n\nVair represents the winter coat of the [[red squirrel]], which is blue-grey on top and white underneath.  To form the linings of cloaks, the pelts were sewn together, forming an undulating, bell-shaped pattern, with interlocking light and dark rows.  The heraldic fur is depicted with interlocking rows of argent and azure, although the shape of the pelts, usually referred to as \"vair bells\", is usually left to the artist's discretion.  In the modern form, the bells are depicted with straight lines and sharp angles, and meet only at points; in the older, undulating pattern, now known as ''vair ond\u00e9'' or ''vair ancien'', the bells of each tincture are curved and joined at the base.  There is no fixed rule as to whether the argent bells should be at the top or the bottom of each row.  At one time vair commonly came in three sizes, and this distinction is sometimes encountered in continental heraldry; if the field contains fewer than four rows, the fur is termed ''gros vair'' or ''beffroi''; if of six or more, it is ''menu-vair'', or miniver.<ref name=\"CGH 79\u201383\">Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 79\u201383.</ref><ref>[[Thomas Innes of Learney|Thomas Innes]], ''Scots Heraldry'', Johnston & Bacon, London (1978), p. 28.</ref>\n\nA common variation is ''counter-vair'', in which alternating rows are reversed, so that the bases of the vair bells of each tincture are joined to those of the same tincture in the row above or below.  When the rows are arranged so that the bells of each tincture form vertical columns, it is termed ''vair in pale''; in continental heraldry one may encounter ''vair in bend'', which is similar to vair in pale, but diagonal.  When alternating rows are reversed as in counter-vair, and then displaced by half the width of one bell, it is termed ''vair in point'', or wave-vair.  A form peculiar to German heraldry is ''alternate vair'', in which each vair bell is divided in half vertically, with half argent and half azure.<ref name=\"CGH 79\u201383\"/>  All of these variations can also be depicted in the form known as ''potent'', in which the shape of the vair bell is replaced by a ''T''-shaped figure, known as a potent from its resemblance to a crutch.  Although it is really just a variation of vair, it is frequently treated as a separate fur.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nWhen the same patterns are composed of tinctures other than argent and azure, they are termed ''vair\u00e9'' or ''vairy'' of those tinctures, rather than ''vair''; ''potent\u00e9'' of other colours may also be found.  Usually vair\u00e9 will consist of one metal and one colour, but ermine or one of its variations may also be used, and vair\u00e9 of four tinctures, usually two metals and two colours, is sometimes found.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\nThree additional furs are sometimes encountered in continental heraldry; in French and Italian heraldry one meets with ''plumet\u00e9'' or ''plumetty'', in which the field appears to be covered with feathers, and ''papelonn\u00e9'', in which it is decorated with scales.  In German heraldry one may encounter ''kursch'', or vair bellies, depicted as brown and furry; all of these probably originated as variations of vair.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 83\u201385.</ref>\n\nConsiderable latitude is given to the heraldic artist in depicting the heraldic tinctures; there is no fixed shade or hue to any of them.{{efn-lr|\"There are no fixed shades for heraldic colours. If the official description of a coat of arms gives its tinctures as Gules (red), Azure (blue) and Argent (white or silver) then, as long as the blue is not too light and the red not too orange, purple or pink, it is up to the artist to decide which particular shades they think are appropriate.\"}}<ref name=\"CoA Official Site\"/>\n\nWhenever an object is depicted as it appears in nature, rather than in one or more of the heraldic tinctures, it is termed ''proper'', or the colour of nature.  This does not seem to have been done in the earliest heraldry, but examples are known from at least the seventeenth century.  While there can be no objection to the occasional depiction of objects in this manner, the overuse of charges in their natural colours is often cited as indicative of bad heraldic practice.  The much-maligned practice of landscape heraldry, which flourished in the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century, made extensive use of such non-heraldic colours.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 75, 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nOne of the most important conventions of heraldry is the so-called \"[[rule of tincture]]\".  To provide for contrast and visibility, metals should never be placed on metals, and colours should never be placed on colours.  This rule does not apply to charges which cross a division of the field, which is partly metal and partly colour; nor, strictly speaking, does it prevent a field from consisting of two metals or two colours, although this is unusual.  Furs are considered amphibious, and neither metal nor colour; but in practice ermine and erminois are usually treated as metals, while ermines and pean are treated as colours.  This rule is strictly adhered to in British armory, with only rare exceptions; although generally observed in continental heraldry, it is not adhered to quite as strictly.  Arms which violate this rule are sometimes known as \"puzzle arms\", of which the most famous example is the arms of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], consisting of gold crosses on a silver field.<ref>Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 85\u201387.</ref><ref>Bruno Heim, ''Or and Argent'', Gerrards Cross, Buckingham (1994).</ref>\n\n====Variations of the field====\n{{Main article|Variation of the field}}\n\nThe [[Field (heraldry)|field]] of a shield, or less often a charge or crest, is sometimes made up of a pattern of colours, or ''variation''. A pattern of horizontal (barwise) stripes, for example, is called ''barry'', while a pattern of vertical (palewise) stripes is called ''paly''. A pattern of diagonal stripes may be called ''bendy'' or ''bendy sinister'', depending on the direction of the stripes. Other variations include ''chevrony'', ''gyronny'' and ''chequy''. Wave shaped stripes are termed ''undy''. For further variations, these are sometimes combined to produce patterns of ''barry-bendy'', ''paly-bendy'', ''lozengy'' and ''fusilly''. Sem\u00e9s, or patterns of repeated charges, are also considered variations of the field.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Arthur Charles|last=Fox-Davies|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry|isbn=1-4179-0630-8|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2004|page=101}}</ref> The [[Rule of tincture]] applies to all sem\u00e9s and variations of the field.\n\n====Divisions of the field====\n[[File:Varpaisj\u00e4rvi.vaakuna.svg|right|upright|thumb|upright=0.45|A shield parted per pale and per fir twig fess]]\n{{main article|Division of the field}}\n\nThe [[Field (heraldry)|field]] of a [[shield]] in heraldry can be divided into more than one [[Tincture (heraldry)|tincture]], as can the various [[Charge (heraldry)|heraldic charge]]s. Many coats of arms consist simply of a division of the field into two contrasting tinctures. These are considered divisions of a shield, so the rule of tincture can be ignored. For example, a shield divided azure and gules would be perfectly acceptable. A line of partition may be straight or it may be varied. The variations of partition lines can be wavy, indented, embattled, engrailed, [[nebuly]], or made into myriad other forms; see [[Line (heraldry)]].<ref>Stephen Friar and John Ferguson. ''Basic Heraldry''. (W.W. Norton & Company, New York: 1993), 148.</ref>\n\n====Ordinaries====\n{{Main article|Ordinary (heraldry)}}\n\nIn the early days of heraldry, very simple bold rectilinear shapes were painted on shields. These could be easily recognized at a long distance and could be easily remembered. They therefore served the main purpose of heraldry: identification.<ref>[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. ''Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles''. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), 18.</ref> As more complicated shields came into use, these bold shapes were set apart in a separate class as the \"honorable ordinaries\". They act as charges and are always written first in [[blazon]]. Unless otherwise specified they extend to the edges of the field. Though ordinaries are not easily defined, they are generally described as including the [[cross]], the [[fess]], the [[pale (heraldry)|pale]], the [[bend (heraldry)|bend]], the [[chevron (insignia)|chevron]], the [[saltire]], and the [[Pall (heraldry)|pall]].<ref>Stephen Friar, Ed. ''A Dictionary of Heraldry''. (Harmony Books, New York: 1987), 259.</ref>\n\nThere is a separate class of charges called sub-ordinaries which are of a geometrical shape subordinate to the ordinary. According to Friar, they are distinguished by their order in blazon. The sub-ordinaries include the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]], the [[Ordinary (heraldry)#Subordinaries|orle]], the tressure, the double tressure, the [[bordure]], the [[chief (heraldry)|chief]], the [[Canton (heraldry)|canton]], the [[label (heraldry)|label]], and [[flaunch]]es.<ref>Stephen Friar, Ed. ''A Dictionary of Heraldry''. (Harmony Books, New York: 1987), 330.</ref>\n\nOrdinaries may appear in parallel series, in which case blazons in English give them different names such as pallets, bars, bendlets, and chevronels. French blazon makes no such distinction between these diminutives and the ordinaries when borne singly. Unless otherwise specified an ordinary is drawn with straight lines, but each may be indented, embattled, wavy, engrailed, or otherwise have their lines varied.<ref>Woodcock, Thomas & John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), 60.</ref>\n\n====Charges====\n{{Main article|Charge (heraldry)}}\n\nA charge is any object or figure placed on a heraldic shield or on any other object of an armorial composition.<ref>John Brooke-Little. ''Boutell's Heraldry''. (Frederick Warne & Company, London: 1973), 311.</ref> Any object found in nature or technology may appear as a heraldic charge in armory. Charges can be animals, objects, or geometric shapes. Apart from the ordinaries, the most frequent charges are the [[cross]] &ndash; with its hundreds of variations &ndash; and the [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] and [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]]. Other common animals are [[Deer|stags]], [[wild boar]]s, [[martlet]]s, and [[fish]]. [[European dragon|Dragons]], [[bat#The bat in heraldry|bats]], [[unicorn]]s, [[griffin]]s, and more exotic monsters appear as charges and as [[supporters]].\n\nAnimals are found in various stereotyped positions or ''[[Attitude (heraldry)|attitudes]]''. [[Quadruped]]s can often be found rampant (standing on the left hind foot). Another frequent position is [[Passant guardant|passant]], or walking, like the lions of the [[coat of arms of England]]. Eagles are almost always shown with their wings spread, or displayed. A pair of wings conjoined is called a [[vol (heraldry)|vol]].\n\nIn [[English heraldry]] the [[crescent]], [[mullet (heraldry)|mullet]], [[martlet]], [[annulet (heraldry)|annulet]], [[fleur-de-lis]], and [[rose (heraldry)|rose]] may be added to a shield to distinguish [[cadency|cadet]] branches of a family from the senior line. These cadency marks are usually shown smaller than normal charges, but it still does not follow that a shield containing such a charge belongs to a cadet branch. All of these charges occur frequently in basic undifferenced coats of arms.<ref>[[Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk]] and [[Don Pottinger]]. ''Simple Heraldry, Cheerfully Illustrated''. (Thomas Nelson and Sons, London: 1953), 20.</ref>\n\n====Marshalling====\n[[File:Stowe Armorial.jpg|thumb|An extravagant example of marshalling: the 719 quarterings of the [[George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham|Grenville]] [[Roll of arms|Armorial]] at [[Stowe House|Stowe]].]]\n\nTo ''marshal'' two or more coats of arms is to combine them in one shield, to express inheritance, claims to property, or the occupation of an office. This can be done in a number of ways, of which the simplest is [[Impalement (heraldry)|impalement]]: [[division of the field|dividing the field]] ''per pale'' and putting one whole coat in each half. Impalement replaced the earlier [[dimidiation]] &ndash; combining the dexter half of one coat with the sinister half of another &ndash; because dimidiation can create ambiguity between, for example, a [[bend (heraldry)|bend]] and a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]. \"Dexter\" (from Latin ''dextra'', right) means to the right from the viewpoint of the bearer of the arms and \"sinister\" (from Latin ''sinistra'', left) means to the left. The dexter side is considered the side of greatest [[honour]] (see also [[Dexter and sinister]]).\n\nA more versatile method is [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartering]], division of the field by both vertical and horizontal lines. This practice originated in Spain ([[Coat of arms of Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile and Le\u00f3n]]) after the 13th century.<ref>Thomas Woodcock & John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), 14.</ref> As the name implies, the usual number of divisions is four, but the principle has been extended to very large numbers of \"quarters\".\n\nQuarters are numbered from the dexter chief (the corner nearest to the right shoulder of a man standing behind the shield), proceeding across the top row, and then across the next row and so on. When three coats are quartered, the first is repeated as the fourth; when only two coats are quartered, the second is also repeated as the third. The quarters of a personal coat of arms correspond to the ancestors from whom the bearer has inherited arms, normally in the same sequence as if the pedigree were laid out with the father's father's ... father (to as many generations as necessary) on the extreme left and the mother's mother's...mother on the extreme right.  A few lineages have accumulated hundreds of quarters, though such a number is usually displayed only in documentary contexts.<ref>Edmundas Rim\u0161a. ''Heraldry Past to Present''. (Versus Aureus, Vilnius: 2005), 38.</ref> The Scottish and Spanish traditions resist allowing more than four quarters, preferring to subdivide one or more \"grand quarters\" into sub-quarters as needed.\n\nThe third common mode of marshalling is with an [[inescutcheon]], a small shield placed in front of the main shield. In Britain this is most often an \"escutcheon of pretence\" indicating, in the arms of a married couple, that the wife is an heraldic heiress (i.e., she inherits a coat of arms because she has no brothers). In continental Europe an inescutcheon (sometimes called a \"heart shield\") usually carries the ancestral arms of a monarch or noble whose domains are represented by the quarters of the main shield.\n\nIn [[German heraldry]], animate [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]s in combined coats usually turn to face the centre of the composition.\n\n===Helm and crest===\n[[File:Wappen Deutsches Reich - Herzogtum Sachsen-Altenburg (Grosses).png|upright|thumb|German heraldry has examples of shields with numerous crests, as this arms of [[Saxe-Altenburg]] featuring a total of seven crests. Some [[thaler]] coins display as many as fifteen.]]\n{{Main article|Helmet (heraldry)|Crest (heraldry)}}\n\nIn [[English language|English]] the word \"crest\" is commonly (but erroneously) used to refer to an entire heraldic achievement of armorial bearings. The technical use of the heraldic term [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] refers to just one component of a complete achievement. The crest rests on top of a [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] which itself rests on the most important part of the achievement: the shield.\n\nThe modern crest has grown out of the three-dimensional figure placed on the top of the mounted knights' helms as a further means of identification. In most heraldic traditions, a woman does not display a crest, though this tradition is being relaxed in some heraldic jurisdictions, and the stall plate of Lady Marion Fraser in the Thistle Chapel in St Giles, Edinburgh, shows her coat on a lozenge but with helmet, crest, and motto.\n\nThe crest is usually found on a [[torse|wreath]] of twisted cloth and sometimes within a [[coronet]]. Crest-coronets are generally simpler than coronets of rank, but several specialized forms exist; for example, in [[Canada]], descendants of the [[United Empire Loyalist]]s are entitled to use a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] military coronet (for descendants of members of Loyalist regiments) or Loyalist civil coronet (for others).\n\nWhen the helm and crest are shown, they are usually accompanied by a [[mantling]]. This was originally a cloth worn over the back of the helmet as partial protection against heating by sunlight. Today it takes the form of a stylized cloak hanging from the helmet.<ref>[[Peter Gwynn-Jones]]. ''The Art of Heraldry''. (Parkgate Books, London: 1998), 124.</ref> Typically in British heraldry, the outer surface of the mantling is of the principal colour in the shield and the inner surface is of the principal metal, though peers in the United Kingdom use standard colourings (Gules doubled Argent - Red/White) regardless of rank or the colourings of their arms. The mantling is sometimes conventionally depicted with a ragged edge, as if damaged in combat, though the edges of most are simply decorated at the emblazoner's discretion.\n\nClergy often refrain from displaying a helm or crest in their [[Ecclesiastical heraldry|heraldic achievements]]. Members of the clergy may display appropriate headwear. This often takes the form of a small crowned, wide brimmed hat called a [[galero]] with the colours and tassels denoting rank; or, in the case of [[Papal coats of arms]] until the inauguration of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2005, an elaborate triple crown known as a [[tiara]]. Benedict broke with tradition to substitute a [[mitre]] in [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|his arms]]. Orthodox and Presbyterian clergy do sometimes adopt other forms of head gear to ensign their shields. In the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition, clergy members may pass crests on to their offspring, but rarely display them on their own shields.\n\n===Mottoes===\nAn armorial [[motto]] is a phrase or collection of words intended to describe the motivation or intention of the armigerous person or corporation. This can form a pun on the family name as in [[Thomas Nevile]]'s motto ''Ne vile velis''. Mottoes are generally changed at will and do not make up an integral part of the armorial achievement. Mottoes can typically be found on a scroll under the shield. In [[Scottish heraldry]], where the motto is granted as part of the [[blazon]], it is usually shown on a scroll above the crest, and may not be changed at will. A motto may be in any language.\n\n===Supporters and other insignia===\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Baldomero Espartero, Prince of Vergara.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Flags as supporters and orders in the armory of the [[Baldomero Espartero, Prince of Vergara|Prince of Vergara]].]]\n\n[[Supporters]] are human or animal figures or, very rarely, inanimate objects, usually placed on either side of a coat of arms as though supporting it. In many traditions, these have acquired strict guidelines for use by certain social classes. On the [[Continental Europe|European continent]], there are often fewer restrictions on the use of supporters.<ref>Ottfried Neubecker. ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols, and Meaning''. (Tiger Books International, London: 1997), 186.</ref> In the United Kingdom, only [[Peer of the realm|peers of the realm]], a few baronets, senior members of orders of knighthood, and some corporate bodies are granted supporters. Often, these can have local significance or a historical link to the armiger.\n\nIf the armiger has the title of [[baron]], hereditary [[knight]], or higher, he may display a coronet of rank above the shield. In the United Kingdom, this is shown between the shield and helmet, though it is often above the crest in Continental heraldry.\n\nAnother addition that can be made to a coat of arms is the insignia of a baronet or of an order of knighthood. This is usually represented by a collar or similar band surrounding the shield. When the arms of a knight and his wife are shown in one achievement, the insignia of knighthood surround the husband's arms only, and the wife's arms are customarily surrounded by an ornamental garland of leaves for visual balance.<ref>Julian Franklyn. ''Shield and Crest''. (MacGibbon & Kee, London: 1960), 358.</ref>\n\n===Differencing and cadency===\n{{Main article|Cadency}}\nSince arms pass from parents to offspring, and there is frequently more than one child per couple, it is necessary to distinguish the arms of siblings and extended family members from the original arms as passed on from eldest son to eldest son. Over time several schemes have been used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baronage.co.uk/jag-ht/jag008.html |title=Baronage.co.uk |publisher=Baronage.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-19}}</ref>\n\n===Blazon===\n{{Main article|Blazon}}\nTo \"blazon\" arms means to describe them using the formal language of heraldry. This language has its own vocabulary and [[syntax]], or rules governing word order, which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms. The verb comes from the [[Middle English]] ''blasoun'', itself a derivative of the French ''blason'' meaning \"shield\". The system of [[blazon]]ing arms used in [[English language|English-speaking]] countries today was developed by heraldic officers in the [[Middle Ages]]. The blazon includes a description of the arms contained within the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] or shield, the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], [[supporters (heraldry)|supporters]] where present, [[motto]] and other insignia. Complex rules, such as the [[rule of tincture]], apply to the physical and artistic form of newly created arms, and a thorough understanding of these rules is essential to the art of heraldry. Though heraldic forms initially were broadly similar across Europe, several national styles had developed by the end of the [[Middle Ages]], and artistic and blazoning styles today range from the very simple to extraordinarily complex.\n\n==National styles==\nThe emergence of heraldry occurred across [[western Europe]] almost simultaneously in the various countries. Originally, heraldic style was very similar from country to country.<ref>Davies, T. R. (Spring 1976). \"Did National Heraldry Exist?\". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''NS II''' (97): 16.</ref> Over time, heraldic tradition diverged into four broad styles: German-Nordic, Gallo-British, Latin, and Eastern.<ref>von Warnstedt, Christopher.

''The Coat of Arms'' '''XI''' (84): 129.</ref> One of the most striking characteristics of German-Nordic heraldry is the treatment of the crest. Often, the same design is repeated in the shield and the crest. The use of multiple crests is also common.<ref name=\"OGH-15\">Thomas Woodcock & John Martin Robinson.

One of the famous armorials is the [[Gelre Armorial]] or ''Wapenboek'', written between 1370 and 1414.\nCoats of arms in the [[Netherlands]] were not controlled by an official heraldic system like the two in the United Kingdom, nor were they used solely by [[Nobility|noble families]]. Any person could develop and use a coat of arms if they wished to do so, provided they did not usurp someone else's arms, and historically, this right was enshrined in [[Roman Dutch law]].<ref>J.

Eastern coats of arms are characterized by a pronounced, territorial, [[clan]] system &ndash; often, entire villages or military groups were granted the same coat of arms irrespective of family relationships. In Poland, nearly six hundred unrelated families are known to bear the same [[Jastrz\u0119biec coat of arms]]. Marks of cadency are almost unknown, and shields are generally very simple, with only one charge. Many heraldic shields derive from ancient [[house mark]]s.

However, there have been other historical cultures which have used symbols and emblems to represent families or individuals, and in some cases these symbols have been adopted into Western heraldry. For example, the [[coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire]] incorporated the royal [[tughra]] as part of its [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], along with such traditional Western heraldic elements as the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and the [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]].\n\n===Greek symbols===\nAncient Greeks were among the first civilizations to use symbols consistently in order to identify a warrior, clan or a state.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The first record of a shield blazon is illustrated in [[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]''.

The tamga was normally the emblem of a particular tribe, clan or family. They were common among the Eurasian nomads throughout Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages (including [[Alans]], [[Mongols]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Turkic peoples]]). Similar \"tamga-like\" symbols were sometimes also adopted by sedentary peoples adjacent to the Pontic-Caspian steppe both in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]],<ref>Ottfried Neubecker.

One could also adopt the tamga of one's master or ruler, therefore signifying said master's patronage. Outside of denoting ownership, tamgas also possessed religious significance, and were used as [[talisman]]s to protect one from curses (it was believed that, as symbols of family, tamgas embodied the power of one's heritage). Tamgas depicted geometric shapes, images of animals, items, or [[glyph]]s. As they were usually inscribed using heavy and unwieldy instruments, such as knives or brands, and on different surfaces (meaning that their appearance could vary somewhat), tamgas were always simple and stylised, and needed to be laconic and easily recognisable.<ref>\u0422\u0410\u041c\u0413\u0410 (\u043a \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0430). \u0412.\u0421. \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 (\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0445, No 7, \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0440, 2001, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 75-86)</ref>\n\n===Tughras===\n{{Main article|Tughra}}\n{{Further information|Coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire}}\nEvery sultan of the Ottoman Empire had his own monogram, called the tughra, which served as a royal symbol. A coat of arms in the European heraldic sense was created in the late 19th century. Hampton Court requested from Ottoman Empire the coat of arms to be included in their collection. As the coat of arms had not been previously used in Ottoman Empire, it was designed after this request and the final design was adopted by Sultan Abdul Hamid II on April 17, 1882. It included two flags: the flag of the Ottoman Dynasty, which had a crescent and a star on red base, and the flag of the Islamic Caliph, which had three crescents on a green base.\n\n==Modern heraldry==\n[[File:Stenungsund vapen.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Arms created in 1977, featuring a hydrocarbon molecule]]\n[[File:052-ADA-Rgmt-COA.png|thumb|upright=0.45|Military coat of arms, depicting a red locomotive.]]\nHeraldry flourishes in the modern world; institutions, companies, and private persons continue using coats of arms as their pictorial identification. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the English [[King of Arms|Kings of Arms]], Scotland's [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], and the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland|Chief Herald of Ireland]] continue making grants of arms.<ref>See the [http://college-of-arms.gov.uk/#newsletter College of Arms newsletter] for quarterly samplings of English grants and the [http://www.nli.ie/h_arms1999.htm Chief Herald of Ireland's webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004045906/http://www.nli.ie/h_arms1999.htm |date=2006-10-04 }} for recent Irish grants.</ref> There are heraldic authorities in [[Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada|Canada]],<ref>See the [http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/main.asp?lang=e Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada].</ref> South Africa, Spain, and Sweden that grant or register coats of arms.

''Heraldry of South African families: coats of arms/crests/ancestry.'' (Balkema, Cape Town: 1972)</ref>\n\nHeraldic societies abound in Africa, Asia, Australasia, the Americas and Europe. Heraldry aficionados participate in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], medieval revivals, [[micronation]]s and other related projects. Modern armigers use heraldry to express ancestral and personal heritage as well as professional, academic, civic, and national pride. Little is left of class identification in modern heraldry, where the emphasis is more than ever on expression of identity.<ref>Stephen Slater. ''The Complete Book of Heraldry''. (Hermes House, New York: 2003), p.238.</ref>\n\nHeraldry continues to build on its rich tradition in [[academia]], [[government]], guilds and [[professional associations]], religious institutions, and the military. Nations and their subdivisions &ndash; provinces, states, counties, cities, etc. &ndash; continue to build on the traditions of civic heraldry. The [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, and other religious institutions maintain the traditions of [[ecclesiastical heraldry]] for clergy, religious orders, and schools. \n\nMany of these institutions have begun to employ blazons representing modern objects unknown in the medieval world. For example, some heraldic symbols issued by the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] incorporate symbols such as guns, airplanes, or locomotives. Some scientific institutions incorporate symbols of modern science such as the [[Symbol (chemistry)|atom]] or particular scientific instruments. The arms of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] uses traditional heraldic symbols to depict the harnessing of atomic power.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=CUdMRj7qOr8C&pg=PA21&dq=atom+symbol+in+heraldry&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihiN2D48XTAhVB_IMKHa4CClwQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&q=atom%20symbol%20in%20heraldry&f=false|title=Heraldic Design: A Handbook for Students|last=Child|first=Heather|date=1976-01-01|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=9780806300719|language=en}}</ref> Locations with strong associations to particular industries may incorporate associated symbols. The coat of arms of [[Stenungsund Municipality]] in Sweden, pictured right, incorporates a hydrocarbon molecule, alluding to the historical significance of the petrochemical industry in the region.\n\nHeraldry in countries with heraldic authorities continues to be regulated generally by [[Law of heraldic arms|laws]] granting rights to arms and recognizing possession of arms as well as protecting against their misuse.

It was developed by [[Raven Software]] and published by [[id Software]] through [[GT Interactive Software|GT Interactive]]. The game was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on August 3, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/?appids=9010|title=News - All News|website=store.steampowered.com}}</ref>\n\nUsing a modified version of the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]], ''Heretic'' was one of the first [[first person (video games)|first-person]] games to feature inventory manipulation and the ability to look up and down. It also introduced multiple [[gib (video gaming)|gib]] objects that spawned when a character suffered a death by extreme force or heat. Previously, the character would simply crumple into a heap. The game used randomized ambient sounds and noises, such as evil laughter, chains rattling, distantly ringing bells, and water dripping in addition to the background music to further enhance the atmosphere. The music in the game was composed by [[Kevin Schilder]]. An indirect sequel, ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'', was released the following year. ''[[Heretic II]]'' was released in 1998, which served as a direct sequel continuing the story.\n\n==Plot==\nThree brothers (D'Sparil, Korax, and Eidolon), known as the Serpent Riders, have used their powerful magic to possess seven kings of Parthori, turning them into mindless puppets and corrupting their armies. The Sidhe elves resist the Serpent Riders' magic. The Serpent Riders thus declared the Sidhe as heretics and waged war against them. The Sidhe are forced to take a drastic measure to sever the natural power of the kings destroying them and their armies, but at the cost of weakening the elves' power, giving the Serpent riders an advantage to slay the elders. While the Sidhe retreat, one elf (revealed to be named Corvus in ''Heretic II'') sets off on a quest of vengeance against the weakest of the three Serpent Riders, D'Sparil. He travels through the \"City of the Damned\", the ruined capital of the Sidhe (its real name is revealed to be Silverspring in ''Heretic II''), then past Hell's Maw and finally the Dome of D'Sparil.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361699/plotsummary|title=Heretic (Video Game 1994)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nThe player must first fight through the undead hordes infesting the location where the elders performed their ritual. At its end is the gateway to Hell's Maw, guarded by the Iron Liches. After defeating them, the player must seal the portal and so prevent further infestation, but after he enters the portal guarded by the Maulotaurs, he finds himself inside D'Sparil's dome. After killing D'Sparil, Corvus ends up on a perilous journey with little hope of returning home.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay of ''Heretic'' is heavily derived from ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', with a level-based structure and an emphasis on finding the proper keys to progress. Many weapons are similar to those from ''Doom''; the early weapons in particular are near-exact copies in functionality to those seen in ''Doom''. Raven added a number of features to ''Heretic'' that differentiated it from ''Doom'', however, notably interactive environments, such as rushing water that pushes the player along, and inventory items. In ''Heretic'', the player can pick up many different items to use at their discretion. These items range from health potions to the \"morph ovum\", which transforms enemies into chickens. One of the most notable pickups that can be found is the \"Tome of Power\" which acts as a secondary firing mode for certain weapons, resulting in a much more powerful projectile from each weapon, some of which change the look of the projectile entirely. ''Heretic'' also features an improved version of the ''Doom'' engine, sporting the ability to look up and down within constraints, as well as fly. However, the rendering method for looking up and down merely uses a proportional pixel-shearing effect rather than any new rendering algorithm, which distorts the view considerably when looking at high-elevation angles.\n\nAs with ''Doom'', ''Heretic'' contains various cheat codes that allow the player to be invulnerable, obtain every weapon, be able to instantly kill every monster in a particular level, and several other abilities. However, if the player uses the \"all weapons and keys\" cheat (\"<code>IDKFA</code>\") from ''Doom'', a message appears warning the player against cheating and takes away all of his weapons, leaving him with only a quarterstaff. If the player uses the \"god mode\" cheat (\"<code>IDDQD</code>\") from ''Doom'', the game will display a message saying \"Trying to cheat, eh? Now you die!\" and kills the player.\n\nThe original shareware release of ''Heretic'' came bundled with support for [[online multiplayer]] through the new [[DWANGO]] service.<ref name=\"mastersofdoom\">{{cite book |author=Kushner, David |title=[[Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture]] |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year=2003 |isbn=0-375-50524-5|page=186}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nLike ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''Heretic'' was developed on [[NeXTSTEP]].

It is the sequel to 1994's ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'', and the second game in Raven Software's \"Serpent Riders\" series. The title comes from the [[German language|German]] noun [[Wiktionary:Hexen|''Hexen'']], which means \"[[witch]]es\", and/or the verb [[Wiktionary:hexen|''hexen'']], which means \"to cast a [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]\".

Hexen was the sequel to Heretic. The 3rd game was supposed to be Hecatomb. #gamehistory}}</ref>\n\n''Hexen: Beyond Heretic'' met with highly positive reviews upon release, though the various 1997 console ports were negatively received due to issues with [[frame rate]] and controls and the aging of the game itself. Critical plaudits for the game centered on the non-linear level design and the selection of three playable characters, each offering a distinct gameplay experience.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the tale of D'Sparil's defeat in ''Heretic'', ''Hexen'' takes place in another realm, Cronos, which is besieged by the second of the three Serpent Riders, Korax. Three heroes set out to destroy Korax. The player assumes the role of one such hero. Throughout the course of his quest, he travels through elemental dungeons, a wilderness region, a mountainside seminary, a large castle, and finally a necropolis.\n\n==Gameplay==\nA new series feature introduced in ''Hexen'' is the choice of three character classes. Players may choose to play as a [[Warrior (character class)|fighter]] (Baratus), a [[Cleric (character class)|cleric]] (Parias), or a [[Wizard (character class)|mage]] (Daedolon). Each character has unique weapons and physical characteristics, lending an additional degree of variety and replay value to the game. The Fighter relies mainly on close quarter physical attacks with weapons both mundane and magical in nature, and is tougher and faster than the other characters. The Mage uses an assortment of long-range spells, whose reach is counterbalanced by the fact that he is the most fragile and slowest moving of the classes.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rich|last=Leadbetter|title=The Hex Factor!|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=17 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=March 1997 |pages=40-44}}</ref> The Cleric arms himself with a combination of both melee and ranged capabilities, being a middle ground of sorts between the other two classes.<ref name=\"SatMag12\">{{cite magazine |title=Hexen Prepares for Saturn Onslaught!|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=12 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=October 1996 |pages=6-7}}</ref> Additionally, certain items, such as the flechette (poison gas bomb), behave differently when collected and used by each of the classes, functioning in a manner better suiting their varying approach to combat.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Hexen: Doom Takes a Medieval Trip |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=93|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=April 1997|page=98}}</ref>\n\n''Hexen'' introduces \"hub\" levels to the series, wherein the player can travel back and forth between central hub levels and connected side levels.<ref name=\"SatMag12\"/> This is done in order to solve larger-scale puzzles that require a series of items or switches to be used.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Hexen: A Little Witchcraft Can Go a Long Way |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=89|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=December 1996 |pages=274-5}}</ref> The player must traverse through a hub in order to reach a boss and advance to the next hub.\n\n==Development==\nLike ''Heretic'', ''Hexen'' was developed on [[NeXTSTEP]].<ref name=\"AppleNeXTMerger\">[http://rome.ro/2006/12/apple-next-merger-birthday.html planet rome.ro: Apple-NeXT Merger Birthday!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305165006/http://rome.ro/2006/12/apple-next-merger-birthday.html |date=2007-03-05 }}</ref> ''Hexen'' uses a modified version of the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]], which allows looking up and down, network play with up to eight players, and the choice of three character classes. It also popularized the \"hub system\" of [[level (computer and video games)|level]] progression in the genre of first-person shooter games. Unlike previous games, which had relied purely on [[General MIDI]] for music, ''Hexen'' is also able to play tracks from a [[CD]]. The game's own CD contained a soundtrack in an audio format that was exactly the same as the MIDI soundtrack, but played through a high-quality sound module. However, the most significant improvement was the addition of wall translation, rotation, and level scripting.\n\n===Engine modifications===\n\"Polyobjects\" are the walls that move within the game. Because the ''Doom'' engine uses the [[binary space partitioning]] system for rendering, it does not enable moving walls. ''Hexen''{{'}}s moving walls are actually one-sided lines built somewhere else on the map and rendered at the desired start spot when the level is loaded. This enables a pseudo-moving wall, but does not allow moving sectors (such as seeing the tops of moving doors). This often creates problems in sectors containing more than one node, however, explaining the relatively limited use of polyobjects.\n\nWhereas ''Doom'', ''Doom II'', and ''Heretic'' rely on lines within the maps to perform simple actions, ''Hexen'' also allows these actions to be activated by [[Action Code Script]] (ACS). These scripts use a syntactic variant of [[C (programming language)|C]], thus allowing special sequencing of game actions. Programming features such as randomization, variables, and intermap script activation enable smooth hub gameplay and are responsible for most of the special effects within the game: on-screen messages, random sound effects, monster spawning, sidedef texture changes, versatile control of polyobjects, level initialization for deathmatch, and even complex environment changes such as earthquakes manipulating floor textures and heights.\n\n===Source code===\nOn January 11, 1999, the [[source code]] for ''Hexen'' was released by Raven Software under a license that granted rights to non-commercial use, and was re-released under the [[GNU General Public License]] on September 4, 2008.<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=238655 Heretic / Hexen - Browse Files at SourceForge.net<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> This allowed the game to be ported to different platforms such as [[Linux]], [[AmigaOS]], and [[OS/2]] ([[EComStation]]).\n\n''Hexen'' is compatible with many [[Doom source port|''Doom'' source ports]]; ''Hexen''{{'}}s features are also compatible with ''Doom'' WADs made for source ports regardless of what game they are being played on.\n\n===Music===\nThe score was composed by [[Kevin Schilder]]. In contrast to ''Heretic'', some songs in ''Hexen'', in addition to MIDI versions, had higher-quality versions on CD. When playing in CD-audio mode, songs absent from CD would be replaced by some existing CD tracks.<ref>[https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Hexen_music Hexen music - DoomWiki.org, the new home of the Doom Wiki - Doom, Heretic, Hexen, Strife, and more<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref>\n\n==Console versions==\n''Hexen'' was released for the [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], and [[Nintendo 64]], all released by GT Interactive during the first half of 1997. While presenting several specific differences in their respective translations of the original PC game, all of them constitute essentially the same game with no major changes to level design, plot, or overall delivery.\n\nThe PlayStation version, developed by [[Probe Entertainment]], has the FMV scenes and [[Redbook audio]] music from the PC CD-ROM version, but no multiplayer mode. The scripting and animation is slower, enemies have only their front sprites and lack gory deaths when attacked by strong hits or weapons, and the frame rate is slower. Although all levels are present in this version and feature their correct layouts, their architecture details are somewhat simplified and there is some loss in overall lighting quality. This port is based on a beta version of the original PC version of ''Hexen'' as many gameplay tweaks are shared, such as the simpler level design and the Fighter's fists being weaker compared to other versions.\n\nThe Sega Saturn version, also developed by Probe,<ref>{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=Hexen: It's Another Classic Id Game!|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=13 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=November 1996|page=30}}</ref> inherits most of the restrictions of the PlayStation version, such as the simplified scenery architecture and the downgraded lighting, although it does feature improvements in certain aspects. The scripting is faster, and the frame rate, while not fluid or consistent, is slightly better. The enemies still have all but their front sprites missing, but they retain their gory deaths when killed by a strong hit or weapon. This version also has hidden two-player link-up cooperative and deathmatch modes, accessible only through the unlockable cheat menu. While this port shares the FMV scenes and most of the Redbook audio music from the other CD-ROM versions, it also includes some new music tracks.\n\nThe Nintendo 64 version, developed by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]],<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Gaming Gossip|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1996|page=34}}</ref> retains all of the graphical quality and scenery architecture, has a consistent frame rate, and includes high detail and smooth filtering. This version also has four-player split-screen cooperative and deathmatch modes, although they must be played in low detail mode.<ref name=IGN64/> Due to cartridge storage limitations, the Nintendo 64 version is based on the original PC floppy version and lacks the FMV scenes and Redbook audio music introduced in the CD-ROM version, although it has new narrative introductions to the levels.\n\n==''Deathkings of the Dark Citadel''==\n''Deathkings of the Dark Citadel'' is an official [[expansion pack]] that was released for ''Hexen'' in 1996. It features three more hubs with a total of 20 new single player levels and six new deathmatch levels. Unlike the ''Shadow of the Serpent Riders'' expansion pack for ''Heretic'', it had to be purchased in retail stores or by mail order. This was unusual at the time, as most non-free expansion packs also included other new or revised gameplay elements. ''Deathkings of the Dark Citadel'', unlike ''Shadow of the Serpent Riders'', was not packaged with the original game, meaning that both had to be purchased separately, and the expansion would not work without already having ''Hexen''. This expansion pack also did not initially include nor enable any music. Music could be fully enabled by applying a patch specially released to address this issue (usually found online under the name \"dkpatch\").\n\nEach of the hubs (The Blight, The Constable's Gate, and The Nave) features one secret level, and new puzzles based on the quest items from the original game (no new quest artifacts were added). Any type of enemy may spawn on the map.\n\nThe final level of the expansion, the Dark Citadel itself, is an arena-like level, which features teleporting waves of monsters and three bosses (Fighter, Cleric, and Mage clones).\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n|EGM = 5.125/10 (SAT)<ref name=EGM92>{{cite magazine|title=Review Crew: Hexen |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997 |page=48}}</ref><br>4.875/10 (N64)<ref name=EGM96>{{cite magazine |title=Review Crew: Hexen 64|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=96 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=July 1997|page=51}}</ref>\n|GSpot = 6.5/10 (DOS)<ref name=GSPC>{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Hudak |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hexen-review/1900-2537441/ |title=Hexen Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=May 1, 1996 |accessdate=February 12, 2018}}</ref><br>4.9/10 (SAT)<ref name=GSSat>{{cite web|last=Broady|first=John|title=Hexen Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hexen-review/1900-2532879/|website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=12 February 2018|date=April 29, 1997}}</ref><br>3.3/10 (PS1)<ref name=GSPS>{{cite web|first=MacDonald|last=Ryan|date=July 24, 1997 |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hexen-review/1900-2545969/ |title=Hexen Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=February 12, 2018}}</ref><br>5.0/10 (N64)<ref name=GS64>{{cite web |last=Fielder |first=Joe |title=Hexen Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hexen-review/1900-2543667/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=12 October 2018 |date=July 3, 1997}}</ref>\n|IGN = 5.0/10 (PS1)<ref name=IGNPS>{{cite web |title=Hexen Review |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1997/05/24/hexen-2 |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=7 June 2018 |date=May 23, 1997}}</ref><br>3.7/10 (N64)<ref name=IGN64>{{cite web |last=Casamassina |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Casamassina|title=Hexen |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/06/27/hexen |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=12 October 2018 |date=June 26, 1997}}</ref>\n|rev1=''Maximum''\n|rev1Score={{rating|5|5}} (DOS)<ref name=Max2/>\n|rev2=''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]''\n|rev2Score={{rating|4|5}} (DOS)<ref name=NGen14/><br>{{rating|2|5}} (SAT, N64)<ref name=NGen29>{{cite magazine|title=Hexen|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=29 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=May 1997|page=152}}</ref><ref name=NGen32>{{cite magazine|title=Hexen|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=32 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=August 1997|page=114 |url=https://archive.org/details/NEXT_Generation_32/page/n115}}</ref>\n|rev3=''[[Saturn Power]]''\n|rev3Score=84/100 (SAT)<ref name=SatP1>{{cite magazine|last=Price|first=James|title=Review: Hexen|magazine=[[Saturn Power]]|issue=1|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=June 1997|page=76}}</ref>\n|rev4=''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]''\n|rev4Score=88% (SAT)<ref name=SSM17>{{cite magazine|last=Leadbetter|first=Rich |title=Review: Hexen|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=17 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=March 1997|pages=66-67}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Heretic'' and ''Hexen'' shipped a combined total of roughly 1 million units to retailers by August 1997.<ref name=1m>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971012044914/http://www.pcgamer.com:80/news/news080497.html | url=http://www.pcgamer.com:80/news/news080497.html | title=Activision to Buy Raven | date=August 7, 1997 | author=Staff | work=[[PC Gamer US]] | archivedate=October 12, 1997 | deadurl=yes }}</ref>\n\nReviewing the PC version, ''Maximum'' remarked that ''Hexen'' sets itself apart from other \"3D slashers\" with its selection of characters and novel approach to level design, which \"leads to your character choosing their path rather than being guided around a rather linear series of rooms, proving that 3D games have matured\".

A review in ''Next Generation'' reasoned that, \"Like oil and water, ''Doom''-style games and console conversions don't mix well. Unless the programmers are willing to rewrite the graphics engine from scratch, PC ports suffer from getting cramped into too little memory and neglecting the console's native 3D hardware.\" The reviewer recommended Saturn owners instead try ''[[PowerSlave]]'' or ''[[Ghen War]]'', first-person shooters specifically designed for the console.<ref name=NGen29/> Shawn Smith and Sushi-X of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' similarly said the game had not converted well from PC.<ref name=EGM92/> Others described the Saturn port as an exact conversion, and argued the problem was simply that ''Hexen'' was too old a game to be released for console in 1997 without any improvements.<ref name=EGM92/><ref name=GSSat/> Though they disagreed on why, most critics agreed that the Saturn version suffers from pixelated graphics,<ref name=EGM92/><ref name=GSSat/><ref name=NGen29/><ref name=GPro102/> dramatic drops in frame rate,<ref name=EGM92/><ref name=NGen29/><ref name=SSM17/> and cumbersome controls.<ref name=GSSat/><ref name=NGen29/><ref name=GPro102/> Scary Larry of ''[[GamePro]]'' gave it a mixed review, summarizing that \"although it doesn't live up to ''PowerSlave''{{'}}s standards, it's still decent fun.\"<ref name=GPro102>{{cite magazine|title=Saturn ProReview: Hexen|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=102|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1997|page=84}}</ref> John Broady of ''[[GameSpot]]'' gave a slightly more dismal assessment: \"Despite these glaring deficiencies, ''Hexen'' nonetheless offers enough enhancements over the standard shooter to warrant a rental, especially for fans of role-playing games who thirst for real-time action. ... But for the rest, the Saturn version of ''Hexen'' is a classic game of too little and too late.\"<ref name=GSSat/> Rich Leadbetter of ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' and James Price of ''[[Saturn Power]]'' defended the Saturn version, commenting that while it is not outstanding, it is far superior to the Saturn version of ''Doom'', which was released at roughly the same time.<ref name=SSM17/><ref name=SatP1/> Price was particularly enthusiastic about the link cable-enabled multiplayer mode.<ref name=SatP1/>\n\nThe Nintendo 64 version also left most critics unimpressed. The four-player mode was praised as an unprecedented feature in console first person shooters,<ref name=EGM96/><ref name=GS64/><ref name=IGN64/><ref name=NGen32/> but the visuals were considered unacceptably poor, particularly the frame rate<ref name=EGM96/><ref name=GS64/><ref name=IGN64/><ref name=NGen32/> and the usage of the Nintendo 64's mip-mapping and anti-aliasing in a way which actually worsens the appearance of the game.<ref name=IGN64/><ref name=NGen32/> As with the Saturn version, some critics opined that ''Hexen'' was too dated by this time to be receiving a straightforward port.<ref name=EGM96/><ref name=IGN64/> Joe Fielder of ''GameSpot'' additionally complained of a severe bug in the save feature.<ref name=GS64/> In a dissenting opinion, Scary Larry concluded that \"Although not as polished as ''[[Turok: Dinosaur Hunter|Turok]]'' or as fun and creepy as ''[[Doom 64]]'', ''Hexen'' gives you three characters to choose from, and the action's addicting once you get into it.\" He gave it higher scores than the Saturn version in every category except sound.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Nintendo 64 ProReview: Hexen |magazine=[[GamePro]]|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |issue=106|date=July 1997 |page=82}}</ref> In contrast, [[Matt Casamassina]] of ''[[IGN]]'' called it \"A shoddy port of a PC game that wasn't so great to begin with.\"<ref name=IGN64/>\n\nThe PlayStation version was still more negatively received, with critics universally razing the conversion for its poor frame rate, pixelated graphics, and sloppy platform jumping controls.<ref name=GSPS/><ref name=IGNPS/><ref>{{cite magazine|title=PlayStation ProReview: Hexen|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=102|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=March 1997|page=74}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120324031651/http://ravensoft.com/games/hexen/view-game/ Official ''Hexen'' webpage at Raven Software]\n* {{dmoz|Games/Video_Games/Shooter/H/Heretic_and_Hexen_Series/Hexen|Hexen}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP2ScBKcz8Y&feature=youtu.be&a Mini-documentary and gameplay of ''Hexen'']\n\n{{Raven Software}}\n\n[[Category:Heretic and Hexen|Hexen I]]\n[[Category:Doom engine games]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Dark fantasy video games]]\n[[Category:Raven Software games]]\n[[Category:Id Software games]]\n[[Category:DOS games ported to Windows]]\n[[Category:Adventure games]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:AmigaOS 4 games]]\n[[Category:Mac OS games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo 64 games]]\n[[Category:Amiga 1200 games]]\n[[Category:GP2X games]]\n[[Category:First-person shooters]]\n[[Category:Cooperative video games]]\n[[Category:Split-screen multiplayer games]]\n[[Category:Commercial video games with freely available source code]]\n[[Category:Video games with digitized sprites]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Video games with variable translation control]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games]]\n[[Category:GT Interactive Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]", "sha1": "8278oivdrwwq7k428ke15t2wplw9g1r"}}, {"title": "Hexen II", "ns": "0", "id": "13613", "revision": {"id": "862361597", "parentid": "862361033", "timestamp": "2018-10-03T22:08:27Z", "contributor": {"username": "Martin IIIa", "id": "10379247"}, "comment": "/* Development */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox video game\n|title=Hexen II\n|image=hexenIIbox.jpg\n|image_size=236px\n|caption=Boxart\n|developer=[[Raven Software]]\n|publisher=[[id Software]]\n|producer= [[Kevin Cloud]]\n|director= Brian Raffel\n|designer= Brian Raffel <br> Eric C.

It was the third game in the ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic|Hexen]]''/''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'' series, and the last in the Serpent Riders trilogy. It was made available on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on August 3, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/1141/ |title=Legendary id Software games now on Steam |author=John Keefer |date= |work= |publisher=GameSpy |accessdate=5 September 2011}}</ref> Using a modified [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]], it featured single-player and multiplayer game modes, as well as four character classes to choose from, each with different abilities. These included the offensive [[Paladin (character class)|Paladin]], the defensive Crusader, the spell-casting Necromancer, and the stealthy Assassin.\n\nImprovements from ''Hexen'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' included destructible environments, mounted weapons, and unique level up abilities. Like its predecessor, ''Hexen II'' also used a hub system. These hubs were a number of interconnected [[level (video games)|level]]s; changes made in one level had effects in another. The Tome of Power artifact made a return from ''Heretic''.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe [[Game mechanic|gameplay]] of ''Hexen II'' is very similar to that of the original ''Hexen''. Instead of three classes, ''Hexen II'' features four: Paladin, Crusader, Assassin, and Necromancer, each with their own unique weapons and play style.<ref name=EGM94>{{cite magazine |title=Protos: Hexen II|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=40}}</ref>\n\n''Hexen II'' also adds certain [[role-playing video game]] elements to the mix. Each character has a series of statistics which increase as they gain [[Experience point|experience]]. This then causes the player character to grow in power as his or her [[Hit points|HP]] and [[Mana]] increases.\n\n==Plot==\nThyrion is a world that was enslaved by the Serpent Riders. The two previous games in the series documented the liberation of two other worlds, along with the death of their Serpent Rider overlords. Now, the oldest and most powerful of the three Serpent Rider brothers, Eidolon, must be defeated to free Thyrion. Eidolon is supported by his four generals, themselves a reference to the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]. To confront each general, the player has to travel to four different [[continent]]s, each possessing a distinct theme ([[Middle Ages|Medieval European]] for Blackmarsh, [[Mesoamerica]]n for Mazaera, [[Ancient Egypt]]ian for Thysis, and [[ancient Greece|Greco-Roman]] for Septimus). Then, finally, the player returns to Blackmarsh in order to confront Eidolon himself inside of his own dominion Cathedral.\n\n==Development==\n''Hexen II'' was based on an enhanced version of the ''Quake'' engine.<ref name=EGM94/> ''Hexen II'', by way of the ''Quake'' engine, uses [[OpenGL]] for 3D acceleration. However, due to the prevalence of [[3dfx]] hardware at the time of release, the Windows version of the game installs an OpenGL [[installable client driver|ICD]] (opengl32.dll) designed specifically for 3dfx's hardware. This driver acts as a [[Adapter pattern|wrapper]] for the proprietary [[Glide API]], and thus is only compatible with 3dfx hardware. Custom OpenGL drivers were also released by [[PowerVR]] and [[Rendition (company)|Rendition]] for running ''Hexen II'' with their respective (and also now defunct) products. Removal of the ICD allows the game to use the default OpenGL system library. Much of the music in this game is remixed versions of the soundtracks of ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic|Hexen]]'' and ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'' to match the hub themes.\n\nActivision acquired the rights to publish a version of the game for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]],<ref name=EGM94/> but it was never released.\n\n===''Siege''===\nA [[Game mod|modification]] titled ''Siege'' was created and released by Raven Software in 1998 using updated [[QuakeWorld]] architecture, aptly dubbed \"HexenWorld\". The production concept was to eliminate a normal deathmatch environment in favor of a teamplay castle siege. The basic premise was to divide the players into two teams\u2014attackers and defenders\u2014with each side either assaulting or protecting the castle respectively. At the end of the time limit, whichever team controlled the crown was declared victorious. The mod featured appropriate objects used in the single-player portion of the game, namely catapults and ballistae. The classes, however, were drastically altered with new weapons and abilities, reflecting the departure from the normal deathmatch experience presented in ''HexenWorld''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.planetheretic.com/siege/siege.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202013157/http://www.planetheretic.com/siege/siege.html |archivedate=2009-02-02|title=Siege Information Overview|accessdate=5 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Source release===\nFollowing the tradition from ''Heretic'' and ''Hexen'', Raven released the [[source code]] of the ''Hexen II'' engine on November 10, 2000.

It features new levels, new enemies and a new playable character class, The Demoness. It focuses on the attempted resurrection of the three Serpent Riders by the evil wizard Praevus, and takes place in a fifth continent, Tulku, featuring a [[China|Sino]]-[[Tibet]]an setting. Unlike the original game, the expansion was not published by id Software, and as such is not currently available via digital re-releases.\n\nThe expansion features new quest items, new enemies, and new weapons for the Demoness. She is the only player class to have a ranged starting weapon (similar to the Mage class in the original ''Hexen''), whereas all other characters start with melee weapons. It also introduced minor enhancements to the game engine, mostly related to user interface, level scripts, particle effects (rain or snow), and 3D objects. ''Portal of Praevus'' also features a secret (easter egg) skill level, with respawning monsters. The only released patch for the expansion added respawning of certain items (such as health and ammo) in Nightmare mode, so that it would be slightly easier for playing.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 84.25% (''Hexen II'')<ref>[http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/39790-hexen-ii/index.html Hexen II for PC - GameRankings<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br> 65.25% (''Portal of Praevus'')<ref>[http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/89273-hexen-ii-mission-pack-portal-of-praevus/index.html Hexen II Mission Pack: Portal of Praevus for PC - GameRankings<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n| Edge = 8/10<ref name=\"Edge review\"/>\n| GSpot = 7.3/10 (''Hexen II'')<ref name=\"GSpot review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hexen-ii-review/1900-2537637/ |accessdate=2017-09-02 |title=Hexen II Review |author=Ron Dulin |date=1997-09-22 |publisher=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> <br> 8.6/10 (''Portal of Praevus'')<ref>[http://asia.gamespot.com/hexen-ii-mission-pack-portal-of-praevus/ Hexen II Mission Pack: Portal of Praevus - GameSpot<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130629190809/http://asia.gamespot.com/hexen-ii-mission-pack-portal-of-praevus/ |date=2013-06-29 }}</ref>\n| IGN = 7.8/10 (''Hexen II'')<ref>[http://www.ign.com/games/hexen-ii/pc-2153 Hexen II - PC - IGN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br> 7.5/10 (''Portal of Praevus'') <ref>[http://www.ign.com/games/hexen-ii/pc-573193 Hexen II Mission Pack: Portal of Praevus - PC - IGN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n}}\n\nBecause of the popularity of the original ''Hexen'', the game was heavily anticipated.

Corvus, the protagonist of the first game, is forced to flee his hometown of Silverspring after the infected attack him, but not before he is infected himself. The effects of the disease are held at bay in Corvus\u2019 case because he holds one of the Tomes of Power, but he still must find a cure before he succumbs.\n\nHis quest leads him through the city and swamps to a jungle palace, then through a desert canyon and insect hive, followed by a dark network of mines and finally to a castle on a high mountain where he finds an ancient Seraph named Morcalavin. Morcalavin is trying to reach immortality using the seven Tomes of Power, but he uses a false tome, as Corvus has one of them. This has caused Morcalavin to go insane and create the plague. During a battle between Corvus and Morcalavin, Corvus switches the false tome for his real one, curing Morcalavin\u2019s insanity and ending the plague.\n\n==Gameplay==\nUnlike previous games in the ''Heretic/Hexen'' series, which were first-person shooters, players control Corvus from a camera fixed behind him in the third-person perspective. Players are able to use a combination of both melee and ranged attacks, similar to its predecessor. While there are still three weapons the player can collect that each use their own ammo, they also have the ability to use several offensive and defensive spells that draw from pools of green and blue mana, respectively. The Tome of Power is no longer an item scattered around the levels, but a defensive spell that still works in the same manner as the other games in the series by improving damage and granting weapons and offensive spells new abilities for a limited time. Melee combat is also more varied, with the ability to perform several attacks using Corvus' bladestaff and cut off the limbs of enemies, rendering them harmless. Players are also able to utilize magical shrines throughout the game that grant a variety of effects upon use, such as silver or gold armor, a temporary boost in health, a permanent enhancement to the bladestaff, etc.\n\nThe game consists of a wide variety of high fantasy medieval backdrops to Corvus's adventure. The third-person perspective and three-dimensional game environment allowed developers to introduce a wide variety of gymnastic moves, like climbing up ledges, back-flipping off walls, and pole vaulting, in a much more dynamic environment than the original game's engine could produce.<ref>{{cite web|last=Staff |first=Raven |title=Official Heretic II FAQ |url=http://www.raven-games.com/h2faq.php |accessdate=2014-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625040221/http://www.raven-games.com/h2faq.php |archivedate=2014-06-25 |df= }}</ref> Both games invite comparison with their respective game-engine namesake: the original ''Heretic'' was built on the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]], and ''Heretic II'' was built using the ''Quake II'' engine, later known as id Tech 2.

A major step in the early development was [[Gerald Brom]]'s concept art. In a month, the company had programmed the game's camera system. After Activision's approval of the game's demo, Raven Software aimed to get the full game finished by Christmas.

His father trained and developed Howard's artistic talents.\n\nCarter spent much of his childhood with relatives in the [[Norfolk]] [[market town]] of [[Swaffham]], the birthplace of both his parents.<ref>[http://www.aroundswaffham.co.uk/general/history Swaffham history] Retrieved 12 November 2013.</ref><ref>[http://www.swaffhammuseum.co.uk/SchoolHowardCarter.shtm Swaffham museum] Retrieved 20 May 2012.</ref> Nearby was the mansion of the Amherst family, Didlington Hall, containing a sizable collection of Egyptian antiques, which sparked Carter's interest in that subject. In 1891 the [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] (EEF), on the prompting of [[Mary Rothes Margaret Cecil, Baroness Amherst of Hackney|Mary Cecil]], sent Carter to assist an Amherst family friend, [[Percy Newberry]], in the excavation and recording of [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] tombs at [[Beni Hasan]]. \n \nAlthough only 17, Carter was innovative in improving the methods of copying tomb decoration. In 1892, he worked under the tutelage of [[Flinders Petrie]] for one season at Amarna, the capital founded by the pharaoh Akhenaten. From 1894 to 1899, he worked with [[\u00c9douard Naville]] at [[Deir el-Bahari]], where he recorded the wall reliefs in the temple of [[Hatshepsut]].\n\nIn 1899, Carter was appointed to the position of Chief Inspector of the [[Egyptian Antiquities Service]] (EAS). He supervised a number of excavations at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (now known as [[Luxor]]). In 1904, he was transferred to the Inspectorate of Lower Egypt. Carter was praised for his improvements in the protection of, and accessibility to, existing excavation sites,<ref>Barbara Ford, Howard Carter, ''Searching for King Tut'' (Freeman & Company, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7167-6587-X}}), p. 19.</ref> and his development of a grid-block system for searching for tombs. The Antiquities Service also provided funding for Carter to head his own excavation projects.\n\nCarter resigned from the Antiquities Service in 1905 after a formal inquiry into what became known as the Saqqara Affair, a noisy confrontation between Egyptian site guards and a group of French tourists. Carter sided with the Egyptian personnel.<ref>James, T. G. H. Howard Carter, I.B.

The doorway was stamped with indistinct [[cartouche]]s (oval seals with hieroglyphic writing). Carter ordered the staircase to be refilled, and sent a telegram to Carnarvon, who arrived two-and-a-half weeks later on 23 November.\n\nOn 26 November 1922, Carter made a \"tiny breach in the top left hand corner\" of the doorway, with Carnarvon, his daughter Lady [[Evelyn Herbert]], and others in attendance, using a chisel that his grandmother had given him for his 17th birthday.  He was able to peer in by the light of a candle and see that many of the gold and ebony treasures were still in place. He did not yet know whether it was \"a tomb or merely a cache\", but he did see a promising sealed doorway between two sentinel statues. Carnarvon asked, \"Can you see anything?\" Carter replied with the famous words: \"Yes, wonderful things!\"<ref>Lord Carnarvon's description, 10 December 1922, quoted in: {{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Nicholas|last2=Taylor|first2=John H.|title=Howard Carter before Tutankhamun|location=London|publisher=British Museum|year=1992|isbn=0-7141-0952-5|page=141}}</ref>  Carter had, in fact, discovered [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb (subsequently designated [[KV62]]). \n\n[[File:maison Carter.jpg|thumb|right|Carter's house in the [[Theban Necropolis]], in 2009]]The next several months were spent cataloguing the contents of the antechamber under the \"often stressful\" supervision of [[Pierre Lacau]], director general of the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities|Department of Antiquities of Egypt]].<ref name=\"Lacau01\">[[:fr:Pierre Lacau|Wikipedia - French edition]]</ref> On 16 February 1923, Carter opened the sealed doorway and found that it did indeed lead to a burial chamber, and he got his first glimpse of the [[sarcophagus]] of Tutankhamun. The tomb was considered the best preserved and most intact pharaonic tomb ever found in the Valley of the Kings, and the discovery was eagerly covered by the world's press, but most of their representatives were kept in their hotels, much to their annoyance. Only [[Henry Vollam Morton|H. V. Morton]] of [[The Times]] was allowed on the scene, and his vivid descriptions helped to cement Carter's reputation with the British public.\n\nCarter's own notes and photographic evidence indicate that he, Lord Carnarvon, and Lady Evelyn Herbert entered the burial chamber in November 1922, shortly after the tomb's discovery and before the official opening.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reeves|first=C.

North of this was [[Caledonia]], inhabited by the ''Picti'', whose uprisings forced Rome's legions back to [[Hadrian's Wall]]. As Rome finally [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|withdrew from Britain]], [[Gaels|Gaelic]] raiders called the ''[[Scoti]]'' began colonising Western Scotland and Wales. Prior to Roman times, [[prehistoric Scotland]] entered the [[Neolithic Era]] about 4000&nbsp;BC, the [[Bronze Age]] about 2000&nbsp;BC, and the [[Iron Age]] around 700&nbsp;BC.\n\nThe Gaelic kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] was founded on the west coast of Scotland in the 6th century. In the following century, [[History of Christianity in Ireland|Irish]] missionaries introduced the previously [[Pictish religion|pagan Picts]] to [[Celtic church|Celtic Christianity]]. Following [[Saxon England|England]]'s [[Gregorian mission]], the Pictish king [[Nechtan mac Der-Ilei|Nechtan]] chose to abolish most Celtic practices in favour of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman rite]], restricting Gaelic influence on his kingdom and avoiding war with [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglian]] [[Northumbria]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/sysm/scots/teachers/background.shtml | title = Scots and Picts | publisher = BBC Education Scotland | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}</ref> Towards the end of the 8th century, the [[Viking invasions of Scotland|Viking invasions]] began, forcing the Picts and Gaels to cease their historic hostility to each other and to unite in the 9th century, forming the [[Kingdom of Scotland]].\n\nThe Kingdom of Scotland was united under the [[House of Alpin]], whose members fought among each other during frequent disputed successions. The last Alpin king, [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]], died without issue in the early 11th century and the kingdom passed through his daughter's son to the [[House of Dunkeld]] or Canmore. The last Dunkeld king, [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], died in 1286. He left only his infant granddaughter [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]] as heir, who died herself four years later. England, under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], would take advantage of this questioned succession to launch a series of conquests, resulting in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], as Scotland passed back and forth between the [[House of Balliol]] and the [[House of Bruce]]. Scotland's ultimate victory confirmed Scotland as a fully independent and sovereign kingdom.\n\nWhen [[David II of Scotland|King David II]] died without issue, his nephew [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] established the [[House of Stuart]], which would rule Scotland uncontested for the next three centuries. [[James I of England|James VI]], Stuart king of Scotland, also inherited the throne of England in 1603, and the Stuart kings and queens ruled both independent kingdoms until the [[Act of Union, 1707|Act of Union]] in 1707 merged the two kingdoms into a new state, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/uniting.htm | title = Uniting the kingdom? | publisher = National Archives | accessdate = 2 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp | title = Union of Crowns to Union of Parliaments: The Union of the Parliaments 1707 | publisher = [[Education Scotland]] | accessdate = 23 November 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161121202825/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp | archive-date = 21 November 2016 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[[s:Act of Union 1707|Union with England Act 1707]], Article II.</ref> Ruling until 1714, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was the last Stuart monarch. Since 1714, the succession of the [[British monarchs]] of the houses of [[House of Hanover|Hanover]] and [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Windsor)]] has been due to their descent from [[James VI and I]] of the House of Stuart.\n\nDuring the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and [[Industrial Revolution]], Scotland became one of the commercial, intellectual and industrial powerhouses of Europe. Later, its [[de-industrialization|industrial decline]] following the Second World War was particularly acute. In recent decades Scotland has enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance, fuelled in part by a resurgent [[financial services]] sector and the proceeds of [[North Sea oil]] and gas. Since the 1950s, nationalism has become a strong political topic, with serious debates on [[Scottish independence]], and a referendum in 2014 about leaving the British Union.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Pre-history==\n{{Main|Prehistoric Scotland}}\n[[File:Knapp of Howar 2.jpg|thumb|right|The oldest standing house in Northern Europe is at [[Knap of Howar]], dating from 3500&nbsp;BC.]]\nPeople lived in Scotland for at least 8,500 years before Britain's [[recorded history]].

In the earlier part of the century, the teachings of first [[Martin Luther]] and then [[John Calvin]] began to influence Scotland, particularly through Scottish scholars, often training for the priesthood, who had visited Continental universities. The Lutheran preacher [[Patrick Hamilton (martyr)|Patrick Hamilton]] was executed for heresy in [[St. Andrews]] in 1528.<ref>Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 102\u20134.</ref> The execution of others, especially the [[Zwingli]]-influenced [[George Wishart]], who was burnt at the stake on the orders of Cardinal Beaton in 1546, angered Protestants. Wishart's supporters assassinated Beaton soon after and seized St. Andrews Castle, which they held for a year before they were defeated with the help of French forces. The survivors, including chaplain [[John Knox]], were condemned to be galley slaves in France, stoking resentment of the French and creating martyrs for the Protestant cause.<ref>M. F. Graham, \"Scotland\", in A. Pettegree, ''The Reformation World'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 414.</ref>\n\nLimited toleration and the influence of exiled Scots and Protestants in other countries, led to the expansion of Protestantism, with a group of lairds declaring themselves [[Lords of the Congregation]] in 1557 and representing their interests politically. The collapse of the French alliance and English intervention in 1560 meant that a relatively small, but highly influential, group of Protestants were in a position to impose reform on the Scottish church. A confession of faith, rejecting papal jurisdiction and the mass, was adopted by [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|Parliament in 1560]], while the young Mary, Queen of Scots, was still in France.<ref>Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 120\u20131.</ref>\n\nKnox, having escaped the galleys and spent time in Geneva as a follower of Calvin, emerged as the most significant figure of the period. The Calvinism of the reformers led by Knox resulted in a settlement that adopted a Presbyterian system and rejected most of the elaborate trappings of the medieval church. The reformed Kirk gave considerable power to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy. There were widespread, but generally orderly outbreaks of [[iconoclasm]]. At this point the majority of the population was probably still Catholic in persuasion and the Kirk found it difficult to penetrate the Highlands and Islands, but began a gradual process of conversion and consolidation that, compared with reformations elsewhere, was conducted with relatively little persecution.<ref>Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 121\u201333.</ref>\n\nWomen shared in the religiosity of the day. The egalitarian and emotional aspects of Calvinism appealed to men and women alike. Historian Alasdair Raffe finds that, \"Men and women were thought equally likely to be among the elect....Godly men valued the prayers and conversation of their female co-religionists, and this reciprocity made for loving marriages and close friendships between men and women.\" Furthermore, there was an increasingly intense relationship In the pious bonds between minister and his women parishioners. For the first time, laywomen gained numerous new religious roles,And took a prominent place in prayer societies.<ref>Alasdair Raffe, \u201cFemale Authority and Lay Activism in Scottish\nPresbyterianism, 1660\u20131740\" in Sarah Apetrei and Hannah Smith, eds.

A [[Solemn League and Covenant]] was entered into, guaranteeing the Scottish Church settlement and promising further reform in England.<ref name=Mackieetal1991pp211-2>Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', pp. 211\u20132.</ref> Scottish troops played a major part in the defeat of Charles I, notably at the [[battle of Marston Moor]].

In 1644, [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]] attempted to raise the Highlands for the King. Few Scots would follow him, but, aided by 1,000 Irish, Highland and Islesmen troops sent by the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederates]] under [[Alasdair Mac Colla|Alasdair MacDonald (MacColla)]], and an instinctive genius for mobile warfare, he was stunningly successful. A [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Scottish Civil War]] began in September 1644 with his victory at [[battle of Tippermuir]]. After a series of victories over poorly trained Covenanter militias, the lowlands were at his mercy. However, at this high point, his army was reduced in size, as MacColla and the Highlanders preferred to continue the war in the north against the Campbells. Shortly after, what was left of his force was defeated at the [[Battle of Philiphaugh]]. Escaping to the north, Montrose attempted to continue the struggle with fresh troops; but in July 1646 his army was disbanded after the King surrendered to the Scots army at Newark, and the civil war came to an end.<ref name=autogenerated3>Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', pp. 217\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe following year Charles, while he was being held captive in Carisbrooke Castle, entered into an agreement with moderate Scots Presbyterians.

Oliver Cromwell led an invasion of Scotland in 1650, and defeated the Scottish army at [[battle of Dunbar (1650)|Dunbar]] and then defeated a Scottish invasion of England at [[battle of Worcester|Worcester]] on 3 September 1651 (the anniversary of his victory at Dunbar). Cromwell emerged as the leading figure in the English government and Scotland was occupied by an English force under [[George Monck]]. The country was incorporated into the Puritan-governed [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] and lost its independent church government, parliament and legal system, but gained access to English markets.<ref>Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', pp. 221\u20134.</ref> Various attempts were made to legitimise the union, calling representatives from the Scottish burghs and shires to negotiations and to various English parliaments, where they were always under-represented and had little opportunity for dissent.

He disregarded parliament, purged the Council and forced through [[religious toleration]] to Roman Catholics, alienating his Protestant subjects. It was believed that the king would be succeeded by his daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of [[William III of England|William of Orange]], Stadtholder of the Netherlands, but when in 1688, James produced a male heir, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], it was clear that his policies would outlive him. An invitation by seven leading Englishmen led William to land in England with 40,000 men, and James fled, leading to the almost bloodless \"[[Glorious Revolution]]\". The Estates issued a ''[[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]]'' that suggested that James had forfeited the crown by his actions (in contrast to England, which relied on the legal fiction of an abdication) and offered it to William and Mary, which William accepted, along with limitations on royal power.<ref name=\"Mackieetal1991pp241-5\"/> The final settlement restored Presbyterianism and abolished the bishops who had generally supported James.

The following \"Ten Years' Conflict\" of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts. The result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Dr [[Thomas Chalmers]] known as the Great [[Disruption of 1843]]. Roughly a third of the clergy, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. The evangelical Free Churches, which were more accepting of Gaelic language and culture, grew rapidly in the Highlands and Islands, appealing much more strongly than did the established church.<ref name=Robb1990/> Chalmers's ideas shaped the breakaway group. He stressed a social vision that revived and preserved Scotland's communal traditions at a time of strain on the social fabric of the country. Chalmers's idealised small equalitarian, kirk-based, self-contained communities that recognised the individuality of their members and the need for co-operation.<ref>J. Brown Stewart, ''Thomas Chalmers and the godly Commonwealth in Scotland'' (1982)</ref> That vision also affected the mainstream Presbyterian churches, and by the 1870s it had been assimilated by the established Church of Scotland. Chalmers's ideals demonstrated that the church was concerned with the problems of urban society, and they represented a real attempt to overcome the social fragmentation that took place in industrial towns and cities.<ref>S. Mechie, ''The Church and Scottish social development, 1780\u20131870'' (1960).</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century the major debates were between fundamentalist Calvinists and theological liberals, who rejected a literal interpretation of the Bible. This resulted in a further split in the Free Church as the rigid Calvinists broke away to form the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland|Free Presbyterian Church]] in 1893.<ref name=Koch2006p416-7/> There were, however, also moves towards reunion, beginning with the unification of some secessionist churches into the [[United Secession Church]] in 1820, which united with the Relief Church in 1847 to form the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland|United Presbyterian Church]], which in turn joined with the Free Church in 1900 to form the [[United Free Church of Scotland]]. The removal of legislation on lay patronage would allow the majority of the Free Church to rejoin Church of Scotland in 1929.

Formerly a Liberal stronghold, the industrial districts switched to Labour by 1922, with a base in the Irish Catholic working class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing and rent issues. However, the \"Reds\" operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament; in the face of heavy unemployment the workers' mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.<ref>I.

The decline of traditional industries between the wars undermined recruitment. English universities increased the numbers of students registered between 1924 and 1927 by 19 per cent, but in Scotland the numbers fell, particularly among women. In the same period, while expenditure in English universities rose by 90 per cent, in Scotland the increase was less than a third of that figure.<ref>C.

His father was of senatorial rank, and was a [[first cousin]] of the emperor [[Trajan]]. Early in Hadrian's career, before Trajan became emperor, he married Trajan's grand-niece [[Vibia Sabina]], possibly at the behest of Trajan's wife, [[Pompeia Plotina]]. Plotina and Trajan's close friend and adviser [[Lucius Licinius Sura|Licinius Sura]] were well disposed towards Hadrian. When Trajan died, his widow claimed that immediately before his death, he had nominated Hadrian as emperor.\n\nRome's military and Senate approved Hadrian's succession, but soon after, four leading senators who had opposed Hadrian, or seemed to threaten his succession, were unlawfully put to death; the senate held Hadrian responsible for this, and never forgave him. He earned further disapproval among the elite by abandoning Trajan's expansionist policies and recent territorial gains in [[Roman Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], [[Roman Assyria|Assyria]] and [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]], and parts of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]]. Hadrian preferred to invest in the development of stable, defensible borders, and the unification, under his overall leadership, of the empire's disparate peoples. He is known for building [[Hadrian's Wall]], which marked the northern limit of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]].\n\nHadrian energetically pursued his own Imperial ideals and personal interests. He visited almost every province of the Empire, accompanied by a probably vast Imperial retinue of specialists and administrators. He encouraged military preparedness and discipline, and fostered, designed or personally subsidised various civil and religious institutions and building projects. In Rome itself, he rebuilt or completed the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], and constructed the vast [[Temple of Venus and Roma]]. In Egypt, he may have rebuilt the [[Serapeum of Alexandria]]. An ardent [[Philhellene|admirer of Greece]], he sought to make [[Athens]] the cultural capital of the Empire and ordered the construction of many opulent temples there. His intense relationship with the Greek youth [[Antinous]], and the latter's untimely death, led to Hadrian's establishment of an enduring and widespread popular cult. Late in his reign he suppressed the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in [[Judaea Province|Judaea]]; with this major exception, Hadrian's reign was generally peaceful.\n\nHadrian's last years were marred by chronic illness. He saw the Bar Kokhba revolt as the failure of his panhellenic ideal. His execution of two more senators for their alleged plots against him provoked further resentment. His marriage to [[Vibia Sabina]] had been unhappy and childless; in 138 he adopted [[Antoninus Pius]] and nominated him as a successor, on the condition that Antoninus adopt [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]] as his own heirs. Hadrian died the same year at [[Baiae]], and Antoninus had him deified, despite opposition from the Senate. [[Edward Gibbon]] includes him among the Empire's \"[[Five good emperors]]\", a \"benevolent dictator\"; Hadrian's own senate found him remote and authoritarian. He has been described as enigmatic and contradictory, with a capacity for both great personal generosity and extreme cruelty, and driven by insatiable curiosity, self-conceit, and above all, ambition.<ref>Ando, Clifford. \u201cPhoenix.\u201d Phoenix, vol. 52, no. 1/2, 1998, pp. 183\u2013185.

Less welcome than such largesse was his decision in 127 to divide Italy into four regions under imperial legates with consular rank, acting as governors.

This time his visit to Greece seems to have concentrated on Athens and [[Sparta]] \u2013 the two ancient rivals for dominance of Greece. Hadrian had played with the idea of focusing his Greek revival around the [[Amphictyonic League]] based in Delphi, but by now he had decided on something far grander. His new [[Panhellenion]] was going to be a council that would bring Greek cities together. Having set in motion the preparations&nbsp;\u2013 deciding whose claim to be a Greek city was genuine would take time&nbsp;\u2013 Hadrian set off for Ephesus.<ref>Anthony Birley, ''Restless Emperor'', pp. 215\u201320</ref> From Greece, Hadrian proceeded by way of Asia to Egypt, probably conveyed across the Aegean with his entourage by an Ephesian merchant, Lucius Erastus.

As Pompey was universally acknowledged as responsible for establishing Rome's power in the east, this restoration was probably linked to a need to reaffirm Roman Eastern hegemony, following social unrest there during Trajan's late reign.<ref>Boatwright, p. 142</ref> Hadrian and Antinous held a lion hunt in the Libyan desert; a poem on the subject by the Greek Pankrates is the earliest evidence that they travelled together.<ref>Opper, ''Hadrian: Empire and Conflict'', p. 173</ref>\n\nWhile Hadrian and his entourage were sailing on the [[Nile]], Antinous drowned. The exact circumstances surrounding his death are unknown, and accident, suicide, murder and religious sacrifice have all been postulated. ''Historia Augusta'' offers the following account:\n{{quote|text=During a journey on the Nile he lost Antinous, his favourite, and for this youth he wept like a woman. Concerning this incident there are varying rumours; for some claim that he had devoted himself to death for Hadrian, and others&nbsp;\u2013 what both his beauty and Hadrian's sensuality suggest. But however this may be, the Greeks deified him at Hadrian's request, and declared that oracles were given through his agency, but these, it is commonly asserted, were composed by Hadrian himself.<ref>''Historia Augusta'' (c.&nbsp;395) Hadr. 14.5\u20137</ref>}}\n\nHadrian founded the city of [[Antinopolis]] in Antinous' honour on 30 October 130. He then continued down the Nile to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], where his visit to the [[Colossi of Memnon]] on 20 and 21 November was commemorated by four epigrams inscribed by [[Julia Balbilla]], which still survive.

Whether or not he returned to Rome, he travelled in the East during 130/131, to organise and inaugurate his new [[Panhellenion]], which was to be focused on the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Athenian Temple to Olympian Zeus]].

Hadrian found it necessary to clarify that [[decurion (administrative)|decurion]]s, the usually middle-class, elected local officials responsible for running the ordinary, everyday official business of the provinces, counted as ''honestiores''; so did soldiers, veterans and their families, as far as civil law was concerned; by implication, all others, including freedmen and slaves, counted as ''humiliores''. Like most Romans, Hadrian seems to have accepted slavery as morally correct, an expression of the same natural order that rewarded \"the best men\" with wealth, power and respect. When confronted by a crowd demanding the freeing of a popular slave charioteer, Hadrian replied that he could not free a slave belonging to another person.<ref>Westermann, 109</ref> However, he limited the punishments that slaves could suffer; they could be lawfully tortured to provide evidence, but they could not be lawfully killed unless guilty of a capital offence.<ref>Marcel Morabito, ''Les realit\u00e9s de l'esclavage d'apr\u00e8s Le Digeste''.

It was built on land he had set aside for the purpose in 121, formerly the  site of Nero's [[Domus Aurea|Golden House]]. The temple was the largest in Rome, and was built in an Hellenising style, more Greek than Roman. The temple's dedication and statuary associated the worship of the traditional Roman goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], divine ancestress and protector of the Roman people, with the worship of the goddess [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]] \u2013 herself a Greek invention, hitherto worshiped only in the provinces \u2013 to emphasise the universal nature of the empire.<ref>Mellor, R., \"The Goddess Roma\" in Haase, W., Temporini, H., (eds), ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der romischen Welt'', de Gruyter, 1991, {{ISBN|3-11-010389-3}}, pp. 960-964</ref>\n\n===Antinous===\n[[File:Hadrian and Antinous bust British Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Hadrian and Antinous \u2013 busts in the British Museum]]\nHadrian had Antinous deified as [[Osiris]]-Antinous by an Egyptian priest at the ancient Temple of Ramesses II, very near the place of his death.

Rome's [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] (temple \"to all the gods\"), originally built by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and destroyed by fire in 80, was partly restored under Trajan and completed under Hadrian in the domed form it retains to this day.

Apollodorus gave him a scathing response: \"Be off, and draw your gourds [a sarcastic reference to the domes which Hadrian apparently liked to draw]. You don't understand any of these matters\". Dio claims that once Hadrian became emperor, he showed Apollodorus drawings of the gigantic [[Temple of Venus and Roma]], implying that great buildings could be created without his help. When Apollodorus pointed out the building's various insoluble problems and faults, Hadrian was enraged, sent him into exile and later put him to death on trumped up charges.<ref>Brickstamps with [[Fasti|consular dates]] show that the Pantheon's dome was late in Trajan's reign (115), probably under Apollodorus's supervision: see Ilan Vit-Suzan, ''Architectural Heritage Revisited: A Holistic Engagement of its Tangible and Intangible Constituents '', Farnham: Ashgate, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1-4724-2062-6}}, p. 20</ref><ref>Cassius Dio, \"Roman History\", 69.4, Loeb Classical Library edition, 1925 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cassius_dio/69*.html]</ref>\n\nHadrian wrote poetry in both Latin and Greek; one of the few surviving examples is a Latin poem he reportedly composed on his deathbed (see [[#Poem by Hadrian|below]]).

The early 3rd-century ''Roman History'' by [[Cassius Dio]] gave a general account of Hadrian's reign, but the original is lost, and what survives is a brief, Byzantine-era abridgment by the 11th-century monk Xiphilinius, who focused on Hadrian's religious interests, the Bar Kokhba war, and little else. The principal source for Hadrian's life and reign is one of several late 4th-century imperial biographies, collectively known as the ''[[Historia Augusta]]''.

After the death of Melville's father in 1832 his mother added an \"e\" to the family surname\u2014seemingly at the behest of her son Gansevoort. (Parker 1996, p. 67.)|group=lower-alpha}} (August 1, 1819&nbsp;\u2013 September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet of the [[American Renaissance (literature)|American Renaissance]] period. His best known works include ''[[Typee]]'' (1846), a romantic account of his experiences in [[Polynesia]]n life, and his whaling novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (1851). His work was almost forgotten during his last 30 years.\n\nHis writing draws on his experience at sea as a common sailor, exploration of literature and philosophy, and engagement in the contradictions of American society in a period of rapid change. He developed a complex, baroque style; the vocabulary is rich and original, a strong sense of rhythm infuses the elaborate sentences, the imagery is often mystical or ironic, and the abundance of allusion extends to biblical [[Bible|scripture]], myth, philosophy, literature, and the visual arts.<!-- This would be more appropriate somewhere in the body --><!-- Melville's way of adapting what he read for his own new purposes, scholar [[Stanley Thomas Williams|Stanley T. Williams]] wrote, \"was a transforming power comparable to Shakespeare's\".< ref >Williams (1956), 231< / ref > -->\n\nMelville was born in New York City, the third child of a merchant in French dry goods and his wife. His formal education ended abruptly after his father died in 1832, as this left the family in financial straits. He briefly became a schoolteacher before he took to sea in 1839 as a sailor on a merchant ship. In 1840, he signed aboard the [[whaler]] ''Acushnet'' for his first whaling voyage but jumped ship in the [[Marquesas Islands]]. He returned to Boston in 1844 after further adventures.\n\nHis first book was ''Typee'' (1846), a highly romanticized account of his life among Polynesians. It became such a best-seller that he wrote the sequel ''[[Omoo]]'' (1847). These successes gave him the financial basis to marry Elizabeth Shaw, daughter of a prominent Boston family, but the success proved hard to sustain. His first novel that was not based on his own experiences was ''[[Mardi]]'' (1849), a sea narrative that develops into a philosophical allegory\u2014but it was not well received. He received warmer reviews for ''[[Redburn]]'' (1849), a story of life on a merchant ship, and his 1850 description of the harsh life aboard a man-of-war in ''[[White-Jacket]]'', but they did not provide financial security.\n\nIn August 1850, Melville moved his growing family to [[Arrowhead (Herman Melville House)|Arrowhead]], a farm in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]], where he established a profound but short-lived friendship with [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], to whom he dedicated ''Moby-Dick''. This novel was another commercial failure, published to mixed reviews. Melville's career as a popular author effectively ended with the cool reception of ''[[Pierre: or, The Ambiguities|Pierre]]'' (1852), in part a satirical portrait of the literary culture at the time. His [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] novel ''[[Israel Potter]]'' appeared in 1855.\n\nFrom 1853 to 1856, Melville published short fiction in magazines, most notably \"[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]\" (1853), \"[[The Encantadas]]\" (1854), and \"[[Benito Cereno]]\" (1855). These and three other stories were collected in 1856 as ''[[The Piazza Tales]]''. In 1857, he traveled to England where he reunited with Hawthorne for the first time since 1852, and then toured the [[Near East]]. ''[[The Confidence-Man]]'' (1857) was the last prose work that he published. He moved to New York to take a position as [[Customs officer|Customs Inspector]] and turned to poetry. ''[[Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War]]'' (1866) was his poetic reflection on the moral questions of the [[American Civil War]].\n\nIn 1867, his oldest child Malcolm died at home from a self-inflicted gunshot. ''[[Clarel|Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land]]'' was published in 1876, a metaphysical epic. In 1886, his son Stanwix died, and Melville retired. During his last years, he privately published two volumes of poetry, left one volume unpublished, and returned to prose of the sea. The novella ''[[Billy Budd]]'' was left unfinished at his death but was published in 1924.\n\nMelville's death from cardiovascular disease in 1891 subdued a reviving interest in his work. The 1919 centennial of his birth became the starting point of the \"Melville Revival\". Critics discovered his work, scholars explored his life; his major novels and stories have come to be considered world classics, and his poetry has gradually gained respect.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nBorn Herman Melvill in New York City on August 1, 1819,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OrTOQR4QyKIC&printsec=frontcover&hl=nl#v=onepage&q&f=false Parker (1996)], 23</ref> to Allan Melvill (1782\u20131832)<ref>Genealogical chart in Parker (2002), 926\u2013929</ref> and Maria (Gansevoort) Melvill (1791\u20131872), Herman was the third of eight children.

Not much else is known from this period, except that he was very fond of drawing.<ref name=\"Parker 1996, 95\">Parker (1996), 95</ref> The visual arts became a lifelong interest.<ref>Parker (2002), 674\u2013675</ref>\n\nAround May 1834, the Melvilles<!-- should this be \"Melvills\"? --> moved to another house in Albany, a three-story brick house. That same month a fire destroyed Gansevoort's skin-preparing factory, which left him with personnel he could neither employ nor afford. Instead he pulled Melville out of the bank to man the cap and fur store.<ref name=\"Parker 1996, 95\"/> (Biographer Andrew Delbanco says that Gansevoort was doing so well he could hire his younger brother until a fire broke out in 1835, destroying both factory and the store.<ref>Delbanco (2005), 25</ref>)\n\nIn 1835, while still working in the store, Melville enrolled in Albany Classical School, perhaps using Maria's part of the proceeds from the sale of the estate of his maternal grandmother in March 1835.<ref>Parker (1996), 98</ref> In September of the following year Herman was back in Albany Academy in the Latin course. He also participated in debating societies, in an apparent effort to make up as much as he could for his missed years of schooling. In this period he read Shakespeare\u2014at least ''[[Macbeth]]'', whose witch scenes gave him the chance to teasingly scare his sisters.<ref>Parker (1996), 107</ref> In March 1837, he was again withdrawn from Albany Academy.\n\nGansevoort served as a role model and support for Melville in many ways throughout his life, at this time particularly in forming a self-directed educational plan. In early 1834 Gansevoort had become a member of Albany's Young Men's Association for Mutual Improvement, and in January 1835 Melville joined.<ref>Parker (1996), 97</ref> Gansevoort also had copies of John Todd's ''Index Rerum'', a blank register for indexing remarkable passages from books one had read for easy retrieval. Among the sample entries was \"Pequot, beautiful description of the war with,\" with a short title reference to the place in Benjamin Trumbull's ''A Complete History of Connecticut'' (1797 or 1818) where the description could be found. The two surviving volumes of Gansevoort's are the best evidence for Melville's reading in this period. Gansevoort's entries include books Melville used for ''Moby-Dick'' and ''Clarel'', such as \"Parsees\u2014of India\u2014an excellent description of their character, & religion & an account of their descent\u2014East India Sketch Book p. 21.\"<ref>Parker (1996), 108\u2013109</ref> Other entries are on Panther, the pirate's cabin, and storm at sea from [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[The Red Rover]]'', Saint-Saba.<ref>Parker (1996), 110</ref>\n\nThe [[Panic of 1837]] forced Gansevoort to file for bankruptcy in April. Uncle Thomas Jr. had not paid taxes on the farm, so he left Pittsfield secretly; he settled in [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]], Illinois. In June Maria told the younger children they must leave Albany for somewhere cheaper. Gansevoort began studying law in New York City while Herman managed the farm. However, that summer Herman decided to become a schoolteacher. He succeeded in getting a position at Sikes District School near [[Lenox, Massachusetts]], where he taught some 30 students of many ages, including his own.<ref>Parker (1996), 117</ref>\n\nHis term{{clarify|date=May 2018}} over, he returned to his mother in 1838. In February he was elected president of the Philo Logos Society, which Peter Gansevoort invited to move into Stanwix Hall for no rent. In the ''Albany Microscope'' in March, Melville published two polemical letters about issues in vogue in the debating societies whose subjects are now obscure. Leon Howard and Hershel Parker suggest that the real issue was the youthful desire to have his rhetorical skills publicly recognized.<ref>Parker (1996), 112 and 124</ref>\n\nIn May the Melvilles moved to a [[Herman Melville House (Troy, New York)|rented house]] in Lansingburgh, almost 12 miles north of Albany.<ref>Parker (1996), 126</ref> Nothing is known about what Melville did or where he went for several months after he finished teaching at Sikes.<ref>Parker (1996), 126, 128\u2013129</ref>\n\nOn November 12, five days after arriving in Lansingburgh, Melville paid for a term at Lansingburgh Academy to study surveying and engineering. In an April 1839 letter recommending Herman for a job in the Engineer Department of the [[Erie Canal]], Peter Gansevoort says his nephew \"possesses the ambition to make himself useful in a business which he desires to make his profession,\" but no job resulted.<ref>Parker (1996), 136\u2013137</ref>\n\nJust weeks after this failure, Melville's first known published essay appeared.

On this trip it is possible that Herman went up the Mississippi, where he may well have witnessed scenes of frontier life he later used in his books.

Cutting in and trying-out (boiling) a single whale took some three days, and a whale yielded approximately one barrel of oil per foot of length and per ton of weight (the average whale weighed 40 to 60 tons). The oil was kept on deck for a day to cool off, and was then stowed down; scrubbing the deck completed the labor.

They settled in a house on Fourth Avenue in New York City.\n\nAccording to scholars Joyce Deveau Kennedy and Frederick James Kennedy, Lizzie brought the following qualities to their marriage: a sense of religious obligation in marriage, an intent to make a home with Melville regardless of place, a willingness to please her husband by performing such \"tasks of drudgery\" as mending stockings, an ability to hide her agitation, and a desire \"to shield Melville from unpleasantness.\"<ref>Kennedy & Kennedy (1978b), 6</ref> The Kennedys conclude their assessment with:\n\n:If the ensuing years did bring regrets to Melville's life, it is impossible to believe he would have regretted marrying Elizabeth. In fact he must have realized that he could not have borne the weight of those years unaided\u2014that without her loyalty, intelligence, and affection, his own wild imagination would have had no \"port or haven.\"<ref>Kennedy & Kennedy (1978b), 7</ref>\n\nBiographer Robertson-Lorant's cites \"Lizzie's adventurous spirit and abundant energy,\" and she suggests that \"her pluck and good humor might have been what attracted Melville to her, and vice versa.\"<ref>Robertson-Lorant (1996), 164</ref> An example of such good humor appears in a letter about her not yet used to being married: \"It seems sometimes exactly as if I were here for a ''visit''. The illusion is quite dispelled however when Herman stalks into my room without even the ceremony of knocking, bringing me perhaps a button to sew on, or some equally romantic occupation.\"<ref>Elizabeth Melville's italics.

In June he described the book to his English publisher as \"a romance of adventure, founded upon certain wild legends in the Southern Sperm Whale Fisheries,\" and promised it would be done by the fall. The manuscript has not survived, so it is impossible to know its state at this juncture. Over the next several months, Melville radically transformed his initial plan, conceiving what Delbanco has described as \"the most ambitious book ever conceived by an [[American literature|American writer]].\"<ref>Delbanco (2005), 124</ref>\n\nFrom August 4 to 12, 1850, the Melvilles and their neighbor Sarah Morewood, Evert Duyckinck, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], and other literary figures from New York and Boston, came to Pittsfield to enjoy a period of social parties, picnics, dinners, and the like. On August 5, [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and his publisher James T. Fields joined the group, while Hawthorne's wife stayed at home to look after the children.<ref>Robertson-Lorant (1996), 244</ref> As the men took a stroll through Ice Glen, someone noticed that Hawthorne and Melville were absent, and the group went looking for the two, who were at last found \"deep in conversation.\"<ref>Robertson-Lorant (1996), 246</ref> The following day, the group visited the Hawthornes, who since May had been living in nearby [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]]. \"I liked Melville so much,\" Hawthorne wrote to his friend [[Horatio Bridge]], \"that I have asked him to spend a few days with me,\" an uncharacteristic move for a man so attached to his work that he would not suffer overnight guests to keep him from it.<ref>Robertson-Lorant (1996), 247</ref> The following days, Melville wrote the essay \"Hawthorne and His Mosses,\" a review of Hawthorne's ''Mosses from an Old Manse'' that appeared in two installments, on August 17 and 24, in ''The Literary World''.<ref>Roberston-Lorant (1996), 247\u2013252</ref>\n\nLater that summer, Melville received a package from Duyckinck with a letter asking him to forward it to Hawthorne. When he delivered the package to Hawthorne, he did not know it contained his last three books.<ref>Robertson-Lorant (1996), 251</ref> Hawthorne read them, as he wrote to Duyckinck on August 29,<ref>Robertson-Lorant (1996), 644 note 51</ref> \"with a progressive appreciation of their author.\" He thought Melville in ''Redburn'' and ''White-Jacket'' put the reality \"more unflinchingly\" before his reader than any writer, and he thought ''Mardi'' was \"a rich book, with depths here and there that compel a man to swim for his life. It is so good that one scarcely pardons the writer for not having brooded long over it, so as to make it a great deal better.\"<ref>Quoted in Branch (1974), 25</ref>\n\nIn September 1850, Melville borrowed three thousand dollars from his father-in-law Lemuel Shaw to buy a 160-acre farm in Pittsfield. Melville called his new home [[Arrowhead (Herman Melville)|Arrowhead]] because of the arrowheads that were dug up around the property during planting season.{{sfnb|Delbanco|2005| p = 125}}\n\nThat winter, Melville on an impulse paid Hawthorne a visit, only to discover he was \"not in the mood for company\" as he was finishing ''[[The House of the Seven Gables]]''. Hawthorne's wife [[Sophia Hawthorne|Sophia]] entertained him while he waited for Hawthorne to come down for supper, and gave him copies of ''Twice-Told Tales'' and, for Malcolm, ''The Grandfather's Chair''.<ref>Robertson-Lorant (1996), 263</ref> Melville invited them to visit Arrowhead some time in the next two weeks, and when Sophia agreed, he looked forward to \"discussing the Universe with a bottle of brandy & cigars\" with Hawthorne. A few days later Sophia notified the Melvilles that Hawthorne could not stop working on his new book for more than one day, and Melville felt moved to repeat his invitation: \"Your bed is already made, & the wood marked for your fire.\"<ref>Quoted in Robertson-Lorant (1996), 264</ref> Eventually Melville visited the Hawthornes again, and the next day Hawthorne surprised him by arriving at Arrowhead with his daughter Una. According to Robertson-Lorant, \"The handsome Hawthorne made quite an impression on the Melville women, especially Augusta, who was a great fan of his books.\" They spent the day mostly \"smoking and talking metaphysics.\"<ref>Robertson-Lorant (1996), 266\u201367</ref>\n\nIn Robertson-Lorant's assessment of the friendship, Melville was \"infatuated with Hawthorne's intellect, captivated by his artistry, and charmed by his elusive personality,\" and though the two writers were \"drawn together in an undeniable sympathy of soul and intellect, the friendship meant something different to each of them,\" with Hawthorne offering Melville \"the kind of intellectual stimulation he needed.\" They may have been \"natural allies and friends,\" yet they were also \"fifteen years apart in age and temperamentally quite different,\" and Hawthorne \"found Melville's manic intensity exhausting at times.\"<ref>Robertson-Lorant (1996), 267</ref>\n\nMelville wrote ten letters to Hawthorne, \"all of them effusive, profound, deeply affectionate.\"<ref>Bezanson (1986), 180</ref> Melville was inspired and encouraged by his new relationship with Hawthorne<ref>In an essay on Hawthorne's ''Mosses'' in the ''Literary Review'' (August 1850), Melville wrote:\n{{quote|To what infinite height of loving wonder and admiration I may yet be borne, when by repeatedly banquetting on these Mosses, I shall have thoroughly incorporated their whole stuff into my being,\u2014that, I can not tell.

In between these dates, on October 22, 1851, the Melvilles' second child, Stanwix, was born.<ref>Parker (1996), 870\u2013871</ref> On December 1 Hawthorne wrote a letter of appraisal to Duyckinck, prompted in part by his disagreement with the review in ''Literary World'': \"What a book Melville has written! It gives me an idea of much greater power than his preceding ones. It hardly seemed to me that the review of it, in the ''Literary World'', did justice to its best points.\"<ref>Cited in Parker (1988), 692\u2013693</ref>\n\nIn early December 1852, Melville visited the Hawthornes in Concord, and discussed the idea of the \"Agatha\" story which he had pitched to Hawthorne.

In April 1851 he wrote to his British publisher, [[Richard Bentley]], that his new book, \"possessing unquestionable novelty\" is \"as I believe, very much more calculated for popularity than anything you have yet published of mine\u2014being a regular romance, with a mysterious plot to it & stirring passions at work, and withall, representing a new & elevated aspect of American life....\" {{sfnb|Parker|2002 |pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=5bI50n5WImkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=unquestionable%20novelty&f=false 106\u2013107]}} In fact,\n''[[Pierre: or, The Ambiguities]]'' was heavily psychological, though drawing on the conventions of the romance, and difficult in style. It was not well received. The New York ''[[Weekly Day Book|Day Book]]'' on September 8, 1852, published a venomous attack headlined \"HERMAN MELVILLE CRAZY.\" The item, offered as a news story, reported,\n{{quote|A critical friend, who read Melville's last book, ''Ambiguities'', between two [[steamboat]] accidents, told us that it appeared to be composed of the ravings and reveries of a madman.

From November 1853 to 1856, Melville published fourteen tales and sketches in ''Putnam's'' and ''Harper'''s magazines. In December 1855 he proposed to Dix & Edwards, the new owners of ''Putnam's'', that they publish a selection of the short fiction titled ''Benito Cereno and Other Sketches''. The collection would eventually be named after a new introductory story Melville had written for it, \"The Piazza,\" and was published as ''[[The Piazza Tales]]'', with five previously published stories, including \"[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]\" and \"[[Benito Cereno]].\"<ref>Sealts (1987), 458</ref>\n\nOn March 2, 1855, Frances (Fanny) was born, the Melvilles' fourth child.<ref>Parker (2002), 243</ref> In this period his book ''Israel Potter'' was published.\n\nThe writing of ''The Confidence-Man'' put great strain on Melville, leading Sam Shaw, a nephew of Lizzie, to write to his uncle Lemuel Shaw, \"Herman I hope has had no more of those ugly attacks\"\u2014a reference to what Robertson-Lorant calls \"the bouts of rheumatism and sciatica that plagued Melville.\"<ref name=\"Robertson-Lorant 1996, p. 372\">Robertson-Lorant (1996), p. 372</ref> Melville's father-in-law apparently shared his daughter's \"great anxiety about him\" when he wrote a letter to a cousin, in which he described Melville's working habits: \"When he is deeply engaged in one of his literary works, he confines him[self] to hard study many hours in the day, with little or no exercise, & this specially in winter for a great many days together.

It is strange how he persists\u2014and has persisted ever since I knew him, and probably long before\u2014in wandering to-and-fro over these deserts, as dismal and monotonous as the sand hills amid which we were sitting. He can neither believe, nor be comfortable in his unbelief; and he is too honest and courageous not to try to do one or the other.

Robertson-Lorant takes the different ways one can look at Melville in this period to their extremes:\n\n:An unsympathetic person might characterize Melville as a failed writer who held a low-level government job, drank too much, heckled his wife unmercifully about the housework, beat her occasionally, and drove the children to distraction with his unpredictable behavior. A sympathetic observer might characterize him as an underappreciated genius, a visionary, an iconoclastic thinker, a sensitive, orphaned American idealist, and a victim of a crude, materialistic society that ate artists and visionaries alive and spat out their bones.

He wrote a series of poems, with prose head notes, inspired by his early experiences at sea. He published them in two collections, each issued in a tiny edition of 25 copies for his relatives and friends. Of these, scholar Robert Milder calls ''John Marr and Other Poems'' (1888), \"the finest of his late verse collections\".<ref>Milder (1988), 445</ref> The second privately printed volume is ''[[Timoleon (Melville poem)|Timoleon]]'' (1891).\n\nIntrigued by one of these poems, Melville began to rework the headnote, expanding it first as a short story and eventually as a novella. He worked on it on and off for several years, but when he died in September 1891, the piece was unfinished. Also left unpublished were another volume of poetry, ''Weeds and Wildings'', and a sketch, \"Daniel Orme.\"<ref name=\"Levine 2014, xviii\"/> To ''Billy Budd'', his widow added notes and edited it, but the manuscript was not discovered until 1919, by [[Raymond Weaver]], his first biographer.

In the words of Arvin, Melville's development \"had been abnormally postponed, and when it came, it came with a rush and a force that had the menace of quick exhaustion in it.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Arvin (1950), online</ref> As early a juvenile piece as \"Fragments from a Writing Desk\" from 1839, scholar Sealts points out, already shows \"a number of elements that anticipate Melville's later writing, especially his characteristic habit of abundant literary allusion\".<ref>Sealts (1987), 461</ref> ''Typee'' and ''Omoo'' were documentary adventures that called for a division of the narrative in short chapters. Such compact organization bears the risk of fragmentation when applied to a lengthy work such as ''Mardi'', but with ''Redburn'' and ''White Jacket,'' Melville turned the short chapter into an instrument of form and concentration.<ref>Berthoff (1962), 176</ref>\n\nA number of chapters of ''Moby-Dick'' are no longer than two pages in standard editions, and an extreme example is Chapter 122, consisting of a single paragraph of 36 words (including the thrice-repeated \"Um, um, um.\") The skillful handling of chapters in ''Moby-Dick'' is one of the most fully developed Melvillean signatures, and is a measure of \"his manner of mastery as a writer\".<ref name=\"Berthoff 1962, 177\">Berthoff (1962), 177</ref> Individual chapters have become \"a touchstone for appreciation of Melville's art and for explanation\" of his themes.<ref>Berthoff (1962), 179</ref> In contrast, the chapters in ''Pierre'', called Books, are divided into short numbered sections, seemingly an \"odd formal compromise\" between Melville's natural length and his purpose to write a regular romance that called for longer chapters. As satirical elements were introduced, the chapter arrangement restores \"some degree of organization and pace from the chaos\".<ref name=\"Berthoff 1962, 177\"/> The usual chapter unit then reappears for ''Israel Potter'', ''The Confidence-Man'' and even ''Clarel'', but only becomes \"a vital part in the whole creative achievement\" again in the juxtaposition of accents and of topics in ''Billy Budd''.<ref name=\"Berthoff 1962, 177\"/>\n\nNewton Arvin points out that only superficially the books after ''Mardi'' seem as if Melville's writing went back to the vein of his first two books. In reality, his movement \"was not a retrograde but a spiral one\", and while ''Redburn'' and ''White-Jacket'' may lack the spontaneous, youthful charm of his first two books, they are \"denser in substance, richer in feeling, tauter, more complex, more connotative in texture and imagery.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The rhythm of the prose in ''Omoo'' \"achieves little more than easiness; the language is almost neutral and without idiosyncrasy\", yet ''Redburn'' shows a \"gain in rhythmical variety and intricacy, in sharpness of diction, in syntactical resource, in painterly bravura and the fusing of image and emotion into a unity of strangeness, beauty and dread\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMelville's early works were \"increasingly baroque\"<ref name=\"Bezanson 1986, 203\">Bezanson (1986), 203</ref> in style, and with ''Moby-Dick'' Melville's vocabulary had grown superabundant. Bezanson calls it an \"immensely varied style\".<ref name=\"Bezanson 1986, 203\"/> According to critic Warner Berthoff, three characteristic uses of language can be recognized. First, the exaggerated repetition of words, as in the series \"pitiable,\" \"pity,\" \"pitied,\" and \"piteous\" (Ch. 81, \"The Pequod Meets the Virgin\"). A second typical device is the use of unusual adjective-noun combinations, as in \"concentrating brow\" and \"immaculate manliness\" (Ch. 26, \"Knights and Squires\").<ref>Berthoff (1962), 163</ref> A third characteristic is the presence of a participial modifier to emphasize and to reinforce the already established expectations of the reader, as the words \"preluding\" and \"foreshadowing\" (\"so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene&nbsp;...,\" \"In this foreshadowing interval&nbsp;...\").<ref>Berthoff (1962), 164</ref>\n\nAfter his use of hyphenated compounds in ''Pierre'', Melville's writing gives Berthoff the impression of becoming less exploratory and less provocative in his choices of words and phrases. Instead of providing a lead \"into possible meanings and openings-out of the material in hand,\"<ref name=\"Berthoff 1962, 165\">Berthoff (1962), 165</ref> the vocabulary now served \"to crystallize governing impressions,\"<ref name=\"Berthoff 1962, 165\"/> the diction no longer attracted attention to itself, except as an effort at exact definition. The language, Berthoff continues, reflects a \"controlling intelligence, of right judgment and completed understanding\".<ref name=\"Berthoff 1962, 165\"/> The sense of free inquiry and exploration which infused his earlier writing and accounted for its \"rare force and expansiveness,\"<ref>Berthoff (1962), 169</ref> tended to give way to \"static enumeration.\"<ref name=\"Berthoff 1962, 170\"/> For Berthoff, added \"seriousness of consideration\" came at the cost of losing \"pace and momentum\".<ref name=\"Berthoff 1962, 170\">Berthoff (1962), 170</ref> The verbal music and kinetic energy of ''Moby-Dick'' seem \"relatively muted, even withheld\" in the later works.<ref name=\"Berthoff 1962, 170\"/>\n\nMelville's paragraphing in his best work Berthoff considers to be the virtuous result of \"compactness of form and free assembling of unanticipated further data\", such as when the mysterious sperm whale is compared with Exodus's invisibility of God's face in the final paragraph of Chapter 86 (\"The Tail\").<ref>Berthoff (1962), 175</ref> Over time Melville's paragraphs became shorter as his sentences grew longer, until he arrived at the \"one-sentence paragraphing characteristic of his later prose.\"<ref>Berthoff (1962), 173</ref> Berthoff points to the opening chapter of ''The Confidence-Man'' for an example, as it counts fifteen paragraphs, seven of which consist of only one elaborate sentence, and four that have only two sentences. The use of similar technique in ''Billy Budd'' contributes in large part, Berthoff says, to its \"remarkable narrative economy\".<ref>Berthoff (1962), 173\u2013175</ref>\n\n{{Quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote= Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city. |source=\u2014Matthew 10:15}}\n{{Quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote= I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Feegee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that provident Feegee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pat\u00e9-de-foie-gras.|source=\u2014 Melville paraphrases the Bible in \"The Whale as a Dish\", ''Moby-Dick'' Chapter 65}}\n\nIn Nathalia Wright's view, Melville's sentences generally have a looseness of structure, easy to use for devices as catalogue and allusion, parallel and refrain, proverb and allegory. The length of his clauses may vary greatly, but the \"torterous\" writing in ''Pierre'' and ''The Confidence-Man'' is there to convey feeling, not thought. Unlike [[Henry James]], who was an innovator of sentence ordering to render the subtlest nuances in thought, Melville made few such innovations. His domain is the mainstream of English prose, with its rhythm and simplicity influenced by the [[King James Version|King James Bible]].<ref>Wright (1949), 168</ref>\n\nAnother important characteristic of Melville's writing style is in its echoes and overtones.<ref>Wright (1940), 196 n. 59</ref> Melville's imitation of certain distinct styles is responsible for this. His three most important sources, in order, are the Bible, Shakespeare, and Milton.<ref>Bercaw (1987), 10</ref> Scholar Nathalia Wright has identified three stylistic categories of Biblical influence.<ref>Wright (1940), 196\u2013197</ref> Direct quotation from any of the sources is slight; only one sixth of his Biblical allusions can be qualified as such.<ref>Wright (1949), 137</ref>\n\nFirst, far more unmarked than acknowledged quotations occur, some favorites even numerous times throughout his whole body of work, taking on the nature of refrains. Examples of this idiom are the injunctions to be 'as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves,' 'death on a pale horse,' 'the man of sorrows', the 'many mansions of heaven;' proverbs 'as the hairs on our heads are numbered,' 'pride goes before a fall,' 'the wages of sin is death;' adverbs and pronouns as 'verily, whoso, forasmuch as; phrases as come to pass, children's children, the fat of the land, vanity of vanities, outer darkness, the apple of his eye, Ancient of Days, the rose of Sharon.'<ref>Wright (1949), 139\u2013141</ref>\n\nSecond, there are paraphrases of individual and combined verses. Redburn's \"Thou shalt not lay stripes upon these Roman citizens\" makes use of language of the Ten Commandments in [[Book of Exodus|Ex]].20,{{refn|3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me etcetera.|group=lower-alpha}} and Pierre's inquiry of Lucy: \"Loveth she me with the love past all understanding?\" combines [[Gospel of John|John]] 21:15\u201317{{refn|15:...Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, ''son'' of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?|group=lower-alpha}} and [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] 4:7{{refn|And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts...|group=lower-alpha}}\n\nThird, certain Hebraisms are used, such as a succession of genitives (\"all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob\"), the cognate accusative (\"I dreamed a dream,\" \"Liverpool was created with the Creation\"), and the parallel (\"Closer home does it go than a rammer; and fighting with steel is a play without ever an interlude\").{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA passage from ''Redburn'' (see quotebox) shows how all these different ways of alluding interlock and result in a fabric texture of Biblical language, though there is very little direct quotation.\n\n{{Quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote= The other world beyond this, which was longed for by the devout before Columbus' time, was found in the New; and the deep-sea land, that first struck these soundings, brought up the soil of Earth's Paradise.

The critic F.&nbsp;O. Matthiessen found that the language of Shakespeare far surpasses other influences upon the book, in that it inspired Melville to discover his own full strength.<ref name=\"Matthiessen 1941, 424\">Matthiessen (1941), 424</ref> On almost every page, debts to Shakespeare can be discovered. The \"mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing\" at the end of \"Cetology\" (Ch.32) echo the famous phrase in ''[[Macbeth]]:'' \"Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury/ Signifying nothing.\"<ref name=\"Matthiessen 1941, 424\"/> Ahab's first extended speech to the crew, in the \"Quarter-Deck\" (Ch.36) is practically blank verse and so is Ahab's soliloquy at the beginning of \"Sunset\" (Ch.37):'I leave a white and turbid wake;/ Pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er I sail./ The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm/ My track; let them; but first I pass.'<ref>Matthiessen (1941), 426</ref> Through Shakespeare, Melville infused ''Moby-Dick'' with a power of expression he had not previously possessed.<ref>Matthiessen (1941). 425</ref> Reading Shakespeare had been \"a catalytic agent\"<ref name=\"Matthiessen 1941, 428\">Matthiessen (1941), 428</ref> for Melville, one that transformed his writing from merely reporting to \"the expression of profound natural forces.\"<ref name=\"Matthiessen 1941, 428\"/> The extent to which Melville assimilated Shakespeare is evident in the description of Ahab, Matthiessen continues, which ends in language that seems Shakespearean yet is no imitation: 'Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!' The imaginative richness of the final phrase seems particularly Shakespearean, \"but its two key words appear only once each in the plays...and to neither of these usages is Melville indebted for his fresh combination.\"<ref>Matthiessen (1941), 428\u2013429</ref> Melville's diction depended upon no source, and his prose is not based on anybody else's verse but on an awareness of \"speech rhythm\".<ref>Matthiessen (1941), 425\u2013430</ref>\n\nMelville's mastering of Shakespeare, Matthiessen finds, supplied him with verbal resources that enabled him to create dramatic language through three essential techniques. First, the use of verbs of action creates a sense of movement and meaning. The effective tension caused by the contrast of \"thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds\" and \"there's that in here that still remains indifferent\" in \"The Candles\" (Ch. 119) makes the last clause lead to a \"compulsion to strike the breast,\" which suggests \"how thoroughly the drama has come to inhere in the words;\"<ref>Matthiessen (1941), 430\u2013431</ref> Second, Melville took advantage of the Shakespearean energy of verbal compounds, as in \"full-freighted\". Third, Melville employed the device of making one part of speech act as another \u2013 for example, 'earthquake' as an adjective, or turning an adjective into a noun, as in \"placeless\".<ref>Matthiessen (1941), 431</ref>\n\nMelville's style, in Nathalia Wright's analysis, seamlessly flows over into theme, because all these borrowings have an artistic purpose, which is to suggest an appearance \"larger and more significant than life\" for characters and themes that are in fact unremarkable.<ref name=\"Wright 1940, 198\">Wright (1940), 198</ref> The allusions suggest that beyond the world of appearances another world exists, one that influences this world, and where ultimate truth can be found. Moreover, the ancient background thus suggested for Melville's narratives&nbsp;\u2013 ancient allusions being next in number to the Biblical ones&nbsp;\u2013 invests them with a sense of timelessness.<ref name=\"Wright 1940, 198\"/>\n\n==Critical response==\n\n===Critical review during his lifetime===\nMelville was not financially successful as a writer, having earned just over $10,000 for his writing during his lifetime.<ref>Delbanco, 7</ref> His popularity declined dramatically after his success with [[Travel literature|travelogues]] based on voyages to the South Seas and his stories based on misadventures in the merchant marine and navy.

The centennial of his birth was in 1919. [[Carl Van Doren]]'s 1917 article on Melville in a standard history of American literature was the start of renewed appreciation. Van Doren also encouraged [[Raymond Weaver]], who wrote the author's first full-length biography, ''Herman Melville: Mariner and Mystic'' (1921). Discovering the unfinished manuscript of ''Billy Budd'', among papers shown to him by Melville's granddaughter, Weaver edited it and published it in a new collected edition of Melville's works. Other works that helped fan the flames for Melville were Carl Van Doren's ''The American Novel'' (1921), [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Studies in Classic American Literature]]'' (1923), [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s essay in ''The Double Dealer'' (1922), and [[Lewis Mumford]]'s biography, ''Herman Melville: A Study of His Life and Vision'' (1929).{{sfnb|Marovitz| 2007 | p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=EbxeLZ-xbcgC&q=Melville+Revival+Weaver#v=snippet&q=Melville%20Revival%20Weaver&f=false 517\u2013519]}}\n[[File:Herman Melville profile.jpg|thumb|upright|Herman Melville, 1860]]\n\nStarting in the mid-1930s, the Yale University scholar [[Stanley Williams]] supervised more than a dozen dissertations on Melville that were eventually published as books. Where the first wave of Melville scholars focused on psychology, Williams' students were prominent in establishing Melville Studies as an academic field concerned with texts and manuscripts, tracing Melville's influences and borrowings (even plagiarism), and exploring archives and local publications.<ref>[http://people.hofstra.edu/John_L_Bryant/Melville_Extracts/Volume%2070/extracts070_sep87_pg04.html Nathalia Wright, \"Melville and STW at Yale: Studies under Stanley T.

Sparked by Leyda, the second phase of the Melville Revival emphasized research rather than accepting Melville's early books as reliable accounts.\n\nThe postwar scholars tended to think that Weaver, Harvard psychologist [[Henry Murray]], and Mumford favored Freudian interpretations which read Melville's fiction too literally as autobiography; exaggerated his suffering in the family; and inferred a homosexual attachment to Hawthorne. They saw a different arc to Melville's writing career. The first biographers saw a tragic withdrawal after the cold critical reception for his prose works and largely dismissed his poetry. A new view emerged of Melville's turn to poetry as a conscious choice that placed him among the most important American poets.{{sfnb|Spark|2006| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=i0AsRZRwYjEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Weaver&f=false 238]}}\n\nOther post-war studies, however, continued the broad imaginative and interpretive style.

The volumes have extensive appendices, including textual variants from each of the editions published in Melville's lifetime, an historical note on the publishing history and critical reception, and related documents. In many cases, it was not possible to establish a \"definitive text\", but the edition supplies all evidence available at the time.

Yet he wrote twice as much poetry as Dickinson and probably as many lines as Whitman, and he wrote distinguished poetry for a quarter of a century, twice as long as his career publishing prose narratives. The three novels of the 1850s which Melville worked on most seriously to present his philosophical explorations, ''Moby-Dick'', ''Pierre'', and ''The Confidence Man'', seem to make the step to philosophical poetry a natural one rather than simply a consequence of commercial failure.<ref>Lawrence Buell, \"Melville The Poet,\" in Robert Levine, ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Melville'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-KhKv9kNqkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Buell%20Melville%20Poet&f=false p. 135].</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the Melville scholar Elizabeth Renker wrote \"a sea change in the reception of the poems is incipient.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Renker|first=Elizabeth|title=Melville the Poet: Response to William Spengemann|journal=American Literary History|date=Spring\u2013Summer 2000|volume=12|issue=1&2|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/american_literary_history/v012/12.1renker.html|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref> Some critics now place him as the first [[modernism|modernist]] poet in the United States; others assert that his work more strongly suggests what today would be a postmodern view.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spanos|first=William V.|title=Herman Melville and the American Calling: The Fiction After Moby-Dick, 1851\u20131857|year=2009|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7563-8|pages=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhRtiHBdZWUC&pg=PA54}}</ref> Henry Chapin wrote in an introduction to ''[[John Marr and Other Sailors]] (1888)'', a collection of Melville's late poetry, \"Melville's loveable freshness of personality is everywhere in evidence, in the voice of a true poet.\"<ref>Chapin, Henry Introduction ''John Marr & Other Poems'' kindle ebook ASIN B0084B7NOC</ref> The poet and novelist [[Robert Penn Warren]] was a leading champion of Melville as a great American poet.

Of course, as models of women's oppression, the two are clearly intertwined.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Serlin | first1 = David Harley | year = 1995 | title = The Dialogue of Gender in Melville's ''The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids'' | journal = Modern Language Studies | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 80\u201387 | doi=10.2307/3195291| jstor = 3195291 }}</ref>}} In the end Serlin says that the narrator is never fully able to come to terms with the contrasting masculine and feminine modalities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Serlin|first=David Harley|year=1995|title=The Dialogue of Gender in Melville's \"The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids\"|jstor=3195291|journal=Modern Language Studies|volume=25|issue=2|pages=80\u201387|doi=10.2307/3195291}}</ref>\n\nIssues of sexuality have been observed in other works as well. Rosenberg notes Taji, in ''Mardi'', and the protagonist in ''Pierre'' \"think they are saving young 'maidens in distress' (Yillah and Isabel) out of the purest of reasons but both are also conscious of a lurking sexual motive\".<ref name=Rosenberg/> When Taji kills the old priest holding Yillah captive, he says,\n\n{{quote|[R]emorse smote me hard; and like lightning I asked myself whether the death deed I had done was sprung of virtuous motive, the rescuing of a captive from thrall, or whether beneath the pretense I had engaged in this fatal affray for some other selfish purpose, the companionship of a beautiful maid.<ref>Melville, Herman. ''Mardi'', ed. Tyrus Hillway. New Haven: College and University Press, 1973. p. 132.</ref>}}\n\nIn ''Pierre,'' the motive of the protagonist's sacrifice for Isabel is admitted: \"womanly beauty and not womanly ugliness invited him to champion the right.\"<ref>Melville, Herman. ''Pierre'', New York: Grove Press, 1957. p. 151.</ref> Rosenberg argues,\n\n{{quote|This awareness of a double motive haunts both books and ultimately destroys their protagonists who would not fully acknowledge the dark underside of their idealism. The epistemological quest and the transcendental quest for love and belief are consequently sullied by the erotic.<ref name=Rosenberg/>}}\n\nRosenberg says that Melville fully explores the theme of sexuality in his major epic poem, ''Clarel''. When the narrator is separated from Ruth, with whom he has fallen in love, he is free to explore other sexual (and religious) possibilities before deciding at the end of the poem to participate in the ritualistic order represented by marriage. In the course of the poem, \"he considers every form of sexual orientation \u2013 celibacy, homosexuality, hedonism, and heterosexuality \u2013 raising the same kinds of questions as when he considers Islam or Democracy.\"<ref name=Rosenberg/>\n\nSome passages and sections of Melville's works demonstrate his willingness to address all forms of sexuality, including the homoerotic, in his works. Commonly noted examples from ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' are the \"marriage bed\" episode involving Ishmael and Queequeg, which is interpreted as [[male bonding]]; and the \"Squeeze of the Hand\" chapter, describing the camaraderie of sailors' extracting [[spermaceti]] from a dead whale.<ref>E. Haviland Miller, ''Melville'', New York, 1975.</ref> Rosenberg notes that critics say that \"Ahab's pursuit of the whale, which they suggest can be associated with the feminine in its shape, mystery, and in its naturalness, represents the ultimate fusion of the epistemological and sexual quest.\"<ref name=Rosenberg/> In addition, he notes that Billy Budd's physical attractiveness is described in quasi-feminine terms: \"As the Handsome Sailor, Billy Budd's position aboard the seventy-four was something analogous to that of a rustic beauty transplanted from the provinces and brought into competition with the highborn dames of the court.\"<ref name=Rosenberg/>\n\n===Law and literature===\nSince the late 20th century, ''Billy Budd'' has become a central text in the field of legal scholarship known as law and literature. In the novel, Billy, a handsome and popular young sailor, is impressed from the merchant vessel ''Rights of Man'' to serve aboard H.M.S. ''Bellipotent'' in the late 1790s, during the war between Revolutionary France and Great Britain. He excites the enmity and hatred of the ship's master-at-arms, John Claggart.  Claggart brings phony charges against Billy, accusing him of mutiny and other crimes, and the Captain, the Honorable Edward Fairfax Vere, brings them together for an informal inquiry. At this encounter, Billy is frustrated by his stammer, which prevents him from speaking, and strikes Claggart. The blow catches Claggart squarely on the forehead and, after a gasp or two, the master-at-arms dies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nVere immediately convenes a [[court-martial]], at which, after serving as sole witness and as Billy's ''de facto'' counsel, Vere urges the court to convict and sentence Billy to death.  The trial is recounted in chapter 21, the longest chapter in the book. It has become the focus of scholarly controversy; was Captain Vere a good man trapped by bad law, or did he deliberately distort and misrepresent the applicable law to condemn Billy to death?<ref>Weisberg, Richard H. ''The Failure of the Word: The Lawyer as Protagonist in Modern Fiction'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1989), chapters 8 and 9.</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\nAs early as 1839, in the juvenile sketch \"Fragments from a Writing Desk,\" Melville explores a problem which would reappear in the short stories \"Bartleby\" (1853) and \"Benito Cereno\" (1855): the impossibility to find common ground for mutual communication. The sketch centers on the protagonist and a mute lady, leading scholar Sealts to observe: \"Melville's deep concern with expression and communication evidently began early in his career.\"<ref>Sealts (1987), 462</ref>\n\nAccording to scholar Nathalia Wright, Melville's characters are all preoccupied by the same intense, superhuman and eternal quest for \"the absolute amidst its relative manifestations,\"<ref name=\"Wright 1949, 77\">Wright (1949), 77</ref> an  enterprise central to the Melville canon: \"All Melville's plots describe this pursuit, and all his themes represent the delicate and shifting relationship between its truth and its illusion.\"<ref name=\"Wright 1949, 77\"/> It is not clear, however, what the moral and metaphysical implications of this quest are, because Melville did not distinguish between these two aspects.<ref name=\"Wright 1949, 77\"/> Throughout his life Melville struggled with and gave shape to the same set of epistemological doubts and the metaphysical issues these doubts engendered. An obsession for the limits of knowledge led to the question of God's existence and nature, the indifference of the universe, and the problem of evil.<ref name=\"Milder 1988, 431\"/>\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n[[File:Melville New York Home.jpg|thumb|Plaque outside 104 East 26th street, New York]]\nIn 1985, the New York City Herman Melville Society gathered at 104 East 26th Street to dedicate the intersection of Park Avenue south and 26th Street as Herman Melville Square.

Performances by [[Leopold Stokowski]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] were recorded in 1931 and 1932 using telephone lines between the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] in [[Philadelphia]] and the Bell labs in New Jersey.  Some [[multitrack recording]]s were made on optical sound film, which led to new advances used primarily by [[MGM]] (as early as 1937) and [[Twentieth Century Fox|20th Century-Fox Film Corporation]] (as early as 1941).  [[RCA Victor]] began recording performances by several orchestras using optical sound around 1941, resulting in higher-fidelity masters for 78-rpm discs. During the 1930s, [[Avery Fisher]], an amateur [[violin]]ist, began experimenting with audio design and [[acoustics]]. He wanted to make a radio that would sound like he was listening to a live orchestra\u2014that would achieve high fidelity to the original sound.  After [[World War II]], [[Harry F. Olson]] conducted an experiment whereby test subjects listened to a live orchestra through a hidden variable acoustic filter. The results proved that listeners preferred high fidelity reproduction, once the noise and distortion introduced by early sound equipment was removed.\n\nBeginning in 1948, several innovations created the conditions that made for major improvements of home-audio quality possible:\n\n* [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording]], based on technology taken from Germany after WWII, helped musical artists such as [[Bing Crosby]] make and distribute recordings with better fidelity.\n* The advent of the 33\u2153 rpm [[Long Play]] (LP) microgroove [[vinyl record]], with lower surface noise and quantitatively specified [[RIAA equalization|equalization curves]] as well as noise-reduction and dynamic range systems. [[Classical music]] fans, who were [[opinion leadership|opinion leaders]] in the audio market, quickly adopted LPs because, unlike with older records, most classical works would fit on a single LP.\n* [[FM radio]], with wider audio bandwidth and less susceptibility to signal interference and fading than [[AM radio]].\n* Better [[electronic amplifier|amplifier]] designs, with more attention to frequency response and much higher power output capability, reproducing audio without perceptible [[distortion]].<ref name=\"Lander\">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/3/2006_3_13.shtml David Lander] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223172555/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/3/2006_3_13.shtml |date=2007-02-23 }} \"The Buyable Past: Classic Hi-Fi Components,\" ''American Heritage'', June/July 2006.</ref>\n* New [[loudspeaker]] designs, including acoustic suspension, developed by [[Edgar Villchur]] and [[Henry Kloss]] improved bass frequency response.\n\nIn the 1950s, audio manufacturers employed the phrase ''high fidelity'' as a marketing term to describe records and equipment intended to provide faithful sound reproduction. While some consumers simply interpreted ''high fidelity'' as fancy and expensive equipment, many found the difference in quality between \"hi-fi\" and the then standard AM radios and 78 rpm records readily apparent and bought 33\u2153 LPs such as [[RCA]]'s New Orthophonics and London's ffrr (Full Frequency Range Recording, a UK [[Decca Records|Decca]] system); and high-fidelity phonographs. Audiophiles paid attention to technical characteristics and bought individual components, such as separate turntables, radio tuners, [[preamplifier]]s, [[power amplifier]]s and loudspeakers. Some enthusiasts even assembled their own loudspeaker systems. In the 1950s, ''hi-fi'' became a generic term for home sound equipment, to some extent displacing ''phonograph'' and ''record player''.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the development of the [[Western Electric|Westrex]] single-groove [[stereophonic]] record cutterhead led to the next wave of home-audio improvement, and in common parlance ''stereo'' displaced ''hi-fi''. Records were now played on ''a stereo''. In the world of the audiophile, however, the concept of ''high fidelity'' continued to refer to the goal of highly accurate sound reproduction and to the technological resources available for approaching that goal. This period is regarded as the \"Golden Age of Hi-Fi\", when [[vacuum tube]] equipment manufacturers of the time produced many models considered endearing by modern audiophiles, and just before [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] ([[transistor]]ized) equipment was introduced to the market, subsequently replacing tube equipment as the mainstream technology.\n\nA popular type of system for reproducing music beginning in the 1970s was the integrated [[music centre]]\u2014which combined a phonograph turntable, AM-FM radio tuner, tape player, preamplifier, and power amplifier in one package, often sold with its own separate, detachable or integrated speakers. These systems advertised their simplicity. The consumer did not have to select and assemble individual components, or be familiar with impedance and power ratings. Purists generally avoid referring to these systems as high fidelity, though some are capable of very good quality sound reproduction. Audiophiles in the 1970s and 1980s preferred to buy each component separately. That way, they could choose models of each component with the specifications that they desired. In the 1980s, a number of audiophile magazines became available, offering reviews of components and articles on how to choose and test speakers, amplifiers and other components.\n\n== Listening tests ==\nListening tests are used by hi-fi manufacturers, audiophile magazines and [[audio engineering]] researchers and scientists. If a listening test is done in such a way that the listener who is assessing the sound quality of a component or recording can see the components that are being used for the test (e.g., the same musical piece listened to through a tube power amplifier and a solid state amplifier), then it is possible that the listener's pre-existing biases towards or against certain components or brands could affect their judgment. To respond to this issue, researchers began to use [[Blind experiment|blind tests]], in which the researchers can see the components being tested, but not the listeners undergoing the experiments. In a [[double-blind experiment]], neither the listeners nor the researchers know who belongs to the [[control group]] and the [[experimental group]], or which type of audio component is being used for which listening sample. Only after all the data has been recorded (and in some cases, analyzed) do the researchers learn which components or recordings were preferred by the listeners. A commonly used variant of this test is the [[ABX test]]. A subject is presented with two known samples (sample ''A'', the reference, and sample ''B'', an alternative), and one unknown sample ''X,'' for three samples total. ''X'' is randomly selected from ''A'' and ''B'', and the subject identifies ''X'' as being either ''A'' or ''B''. Although there is no way to prove that a certain methodology is [[Transparency (data compression)|transparent]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Spanos, Aris|year=1999|title= Probability Theory and Statistical Inference |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page=699 |isbn= 0-521-42408-9}}</ref> a properly conducted double-blind test can prove that a method is ''not'' transparent.\n\nScientific double-blind tests are sometimes used as part of attempts to ascertain whether certain audio components (such as expensive, exotic cables) have any subjectively perceivable effect on sound quality. Data gleaned from these double-blind tests is not accepted by some \"audiophile\" magazines such as ''[[Stereophile]]'' and ''[[The Absolute Sound]]'' in their evaluations of audio equipment. [[John Atkinson (music editor)|John Atkinson]], current editor of ''Stereophile'', stated (in a 2005 July editorial named ''Blind Tests & Bus Stops'') that he once purchased a solid-state amplifier, the Quad 405, in 1978 after seeing the results from blind tests, but came to realize months later that \"the magic was gone\" until he replaced it with a tube amp.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/705awsi |date=2005-07-17 |author=John Atkinson |title=Blind Tests & Bus Stops}}</ref> Robert Harley of ''The Absolute Sound'' wrote, in a 2008 editorial (on Issue 183), that: \"...blind listening tests fundamentally distort the listening process and are worthless in determining the audibility of a certain phenomenon.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avguide.com/forums/blind-listening-tests-are-flawed-editorial?page=2 |author=Robert Harley |title=Blind Listening Tests are Flawed: An Editorial |publisher=The Absolute Sound |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2011-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930084747/http://www.avguide.com/forums/blind-listening-tests-are-flawed-editorial?page=2 |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}</ref>\n\nDoug Schneider, editor of the online Soundstage network, refuted this position with two editorials in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodsound.com/editorial/200905.htm |author=Doug Schneider |title=The Misinformed Misleading the Uninformed \u2013 A Bit About Blind Listening Tests |publisher=GoodSound! |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodsound.com/editorial/200906.htm |author=Doug Schneider |title=A Bit More About Blind Listening Tests (6/2009) |publisher=GoodSound! |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}</ref>  He stated: \"Blind tests are at the core of the decades' worth of research into loudspeaker design done at Canada's National Research Council (NRC). The NRC researchers knew that for their result to be credible within the scientific community and to have the most meaningful results, they had to eliminate bias, and blind testing was the only way to do so.\" Many Canadian companies such as Axiom, Energy, Mirage, Paradigm, PSB and Revel use blind testing extensively in designing their loudspeakers. Audio professional Dr. Sean Olive of Harman International shares this view.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dr. Sean Olive |url=http://seanolive.blogspot.com/2009/04/dishonesty-of-sighted-audio-product.html |title=The Dishonesty of Sighted Listening Tests |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}</ref>\n\n== Semblance of realism ==\n[[Stereophonic]] sound provided a partial solution to the problem of creating the [[auditory illusion|illusion]] of live orchestral performers by creating a phantom middle channel when the listener sits exactly in the middle of the two front loudspeakers. When the listener moves slightly to the side, however, this phantom channel disappears or is greatly reduced. An attempt to provide for the reproduction of the reverberation was tried in the 1970s through [[quadraphonic sound]] but, again, the technology at that time was insufficient for the task. Consumers did not want to pay the additional costs and space required for the marginal improvements in realism. With the rise in popularity of [[home cinema|home theater]], however, multi-channel playback systems became affordable, and many consumers were willing to tolerate the six to eight channels required in a home theater. The advances made in [[digital signal processor|signal processors]] to synthesize an approximation of a good concert hall can now provide a somewhat more realistic illusion of listening in a concert hall.\n\nIn addition to spatial realism, the playback of music must be subjectively free from noise, such as hiss or hum, to achieve realism. The [[compact disc]] (CD) provides about 90 [[decibel]]s of [[dynamic range]],<ref name=\"Fries2005\">{{cite book |title=Digital Audio Essentials |last=Fries |first=Bruce |author2=Marty Fries |year=2005 |publisher=O'Reilly Media |isbn=0-596-00856-2 |pages=144\u2013147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0vsd5z2Rg4C&pg=PA147 |quote=Digital audio at 16-bit resolution has a theoretical dynamic range of 96 dB, but the actual dynamic range is usually lower because of overhead from filters that are built into most audio systems.\" ... \"Audio CDs achieve about a 90-dB signal-to-noise ratio.\" \"Most adults can't hear frequencies higher than 15&nbsp;kHz, so the 44.1&nbsp;kHz sampling rate of CD audio is more than adequate to reproduce the highest frequencies most people can hear.}}</ref> which exceeds the 80&nbsp;dB dynamic range of music as normally perceived in a concert hall.<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Recording Engineering |last=Eargle |first=John |authorlink=John M.

Although some [[High-end audio|high-end]] manufacturers do produce integrated systems, such products are generally disparaged by [[audiophile]]s, who prefer to build a system from ''separates'' (or ''components''), often with each item from a different manufacturer specialising in a particular component. This provides the most flexibility for piece-by-piece upgrades and repairs.\n\nFor slightly less flexibility in [[upgrade]]s, a [[preamplifier]] and a power [[amplifier]] in one box is called an ''[[integrated amplifier]]''; with a tuner, it is a ''[[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]''. A monophonic power amplifier, which is called a ''[[Amplifier|monoblock]]'', is often used for powering a [[subwoofer]]. Other modules in the system may include components like [[magnetic cartridge|cartridges]], [[tonearm]]s, hi-fi [[phonograph|turntable]]s, [[Digital Media Player]]s, [[digital audio player]]s, [[DVD]] players that play a wide variety of discs including [[CD]]s, [[CD recorder]]s, [[MiniDisc]] recorders, hi-fi [[videocassette recorder]]s (VCRs) and [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] [[tape recorder]]s. Signal modification equipment can include [[Equalization (audio)|equalizers]] and [[signal processor]]s.\n\nThis modularity allows the enthusiast to spend as little or as much as they want on a component that suits their specific needs. In a system built from separates, sometimes a failure on one component still allows partial use of the rest of the system. A repair of an integrated system, though, means complete lack of use of the system. Another advantage of modularity is the ability to spend money on only a few core components at first and then later add additional components to the system. Some of the disadvantages of this approach are increased cost, complexity, and space required for the components.\n\n== Modern equipment ==\nIn the 2000s, modern hi-fi equipment can include signal sources such as [[digital audio tape]] (DAT), [[digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) or [[HD Radio]] tuners. Some modern hi-fi equipment can be digitally connected using [[fibre optic]] [[TOSLINK]] cables, [[USB|universal serial bus]] (USB) ports (including one to play digital audio files), or [[Wi-Fi]] support. Another modern component is the ''music server'' consisting of one or more [[computer]] [[hard disk|hard drives]] that hold music in the form of [[computer file]]s. When the music is stored in an [[audio file format]] that is [[lossless]] such as [[FLAC]], [[Monkey's Audio]] or [[WMA Lossless]], the computer playback of recorded audio can serve as an audiophile-quality source for a hi-fi system.\n\n== See also ==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}  \n* [[Audio system measurements]]\n* [[Comparison of analog and digital recording]]\n* [[DIY audio]]\n* [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]]  \n* [[Entertainment center]]  \n* [[FM broadcasting]]  \n* [[High-end audio]]\n* [[Low fidelity]] (an approach used by some [[punk rock|punk]] and [[extreme metal]] bands)\n* [[No-Fi|No Fidelity]]\n* [[Radio Data System|Radio Data System (RDS)]]\n* [[Wife acceptance factor]]\n* [[WiFi]] a [[wireless]] term derived from HiFi\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name='argos_midi'>{{cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/lavalampmuseum/3591019798/in/album-72157619081815831/|archive-url=https://archive.org/stream/issuu_retromash_argos-no26-1986-autumnwinter#page/n257/mode/2up|title=Argos Catalogue Autumn/Winter 1986|publisher=Argos|pages=258-259|quote=\"Midi Systems [..] Scheider 2500R Remote Control Midi System [..] Amstrad MS-45 Midi System [..] Toshiba S103K Midi System [etc]|archive-date=2017-03-24|date=1986}}</ref>\n<ref name='matsui_midi_47'>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/crouchingbadger/4434629033/in/photolist-7KSCHg|title=Matsui MIDI 47}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Pier Paolo Ferrari, (2016),''The Hi-Fi's Golden Age'', 1st edition, Bergamo, Italy: Sandit \u2013 {{ISBN|978-88-6928-171-6}}\n* Janet Borgerson and Jonathan Schroeder, (2017), ''Designed for Hi-Fi Living: The Vinyl LP in MIdcentury America.''

The company was founded in 1856 as a [[saddle]]ry manufacturer in [[South Australia]]. In 1908 it moved into the automotive field, becoming a subsidiary of the United States-based [[General Motors]] (GM) in 1931, when the company was renamed '''General Motors-Holden's Ltd'''. It was renamed '''Holden Ltd''' in 1998, and General Motors-Holden in 2005.\n\nHolden sells the remaining stock of the locally produced range of [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] vehicles, and imported GM models. Holden has offered [[Badge engineering|badge engineered]] models in sharing arrangements with [[Chevrolet]], [[Isuzu]], [[Nissan]], [[Opel]], [[Suzuki]], [[Toyota]] and [[Vauxhall Motors]]. In 2013, the vehicle lineup consisted of models from [[GM Korea]], GM Thailand, GM in the US, and the self-developed Commodore, Caprice, and Ute. Holden also distributed the European Opel brand in Australia in 2012 until its Australian demise in mid-2013,<ref>{{cite web |last=Campbell |first=Matt |date=2 August 2013 |title=Opel Australia shuts its doors |url=http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/opel-australia-shuts-its-doors-20130802-2r4ch.html |work=Drive |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811212146/http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/opel-australia-shuts-its-doors-20130802-2r4ch.html |archivedate=11 August 2013 }}</ref> and briefly the American [[Cadillac]] brand in 2009 until the brand's full launch was delayed indefinitely.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/holden-axes-cadillacs-australian-comeback-20090121-146gz|title=Holden axes Cadillac's Australian comeback|last=Blackburn|first=Richard|date=2016-10-03|work=Drive|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1994 to 2017, all Australian-built Holden vehicles were [[Manufacturing in Australia|manufactured]] in [[Elizabeth, South Australia]], and engines were produced at the [[Fishermans Bend]] plant in [[Melbourne]]. Historically, production or assembly plants were operated in all mainland [[States and territories of Australia|states of Australia]]. The consolidation of final assembly at Elizabeth was completed in 1988, but some assembly operations continued at [[Dandenong]] until 1994.\n\nGeneral Motors assembly plants were operated in New Zealand from 1926 until 1990 by [[Holden New Zealand|General Motors New Zealand Limited]] in an earlier and quite separate operation from Holden in Australia. Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability.

He led the league in runs scored (144) and at-bats per home run (9.6), tied for the AL lead in walks (119), was second in RBIs (146), slugging percentage (.683), and total bases (380), and third in OBP (.438) and set a still-standing major league record of 39 homers in his home park, the newly reconfigured Briggs Stadium.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> He also set a major-league record with 11 multiple-home run games. He came in third in the vote for MVP.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nIn 1939 Greenberg was voted to the AL All-Star roster for the third year in a row and was a starter at first base, and singled and walked in 4 at-bats (AL won 3-1).<ref name=autogenerated2 /> He finished second in the AL in home runs (33) and strikeouts (95), third in doubles (42) and slugging percentage (.622), fourth in RBIs (112), sixth in walks (91), and ninth in on-base percentage (.420).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nAfter the 1939 season ended, Greenberg was asked by general manager Jack Zeller to take a salary cut of $5,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5000|1939|r=-3}}}} today) as a result of his off year in power and run production. He was asked to move from first base to the outfield to accommodate [[Rudy York]], who was one of the best young hitters of his generation; York was tried at catcher, third baseman, and outfielder and proved to be a defensive liability at each position. Greenberg in turn, demanded a $10,000 bonus if he mastered the outfield, insisting ''he'' was the one taking the risk in learning a new position. Greenberg received his bonus at the end of spring training.\n\nIn 1940, Greenberg switched from playing the first base position to the [[Left fielder|left field]] position. For the 4th consecutive time, he was voted by the season's AL All-Star team manager to the AL All-Star team.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> In the bottom of the 6th inning, Greenberg and [[Lou Finney]] were sent into the game to replace right fielder [[Charlie Keller]] and left fielder [[Ted Williams]] with Greenberg playing in left field and Finney in right field. Greenberg batted twice in the game and fouled out to the catcher two-times. The NL won the game 4-0. That season, he led the AL in home runs for the third time in 6 years with 41; in RBIs (150), doubles (50), total bases (384), extra base hits (99), at-bats per home run (14.0), and slugging percentage (.670; 44 points ahead of [[Joe DiMaggio]]).<ref name=autogenerated2 /> He was second in the league behind Williams in runs scored (129) and OBP (.433), all while batting .340 (fifth best in the [[American League|AL]]).<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/>  He also led the Tigers to the AL [[pennant (sports)|pennant]], and won his second [[American League]] [[MVP]] award, becoming the first player in major-league history to win an MVP award at two different playing positions.\n\n====World War II service====\nOn October 16, 1940, Greenberg became the first American League player to register for the nation's first peacetime draft.<ref name=\"baseballinwartime.com\">National Baseball Hall of Fame, ''\"Baseball in Wartime\"'' http://www.baseballinwartime.com/player_biographies/greenberg_hank.htm Retrieved March 17, 2015</ref> In the spring of 1941, the Detroit [[draft board]] initially classified Greenberg as [[4F (military conscription)|4F]] for \"[[flat feet]]\" after his first physical for military service and was recommended for light duty. The rumors that he had bribed the board, and concern that he would be likened to [[Jack Dempsey]] who had received negative publicity for failure to serve in World War I, led Greenberg to request to be reexamined. On April 18, he was found fit for regular military service and was reclassified.\n\n[[File:Greenberg being sworn in.jpg|left|thumb|Greenberg taking his oath of service]]\nOn May 7, 1941, he was inducted into the U.S. Army after playing left field in 19 games and reported to [[Fort Custer Training Center|Fort Custer]] at [[Battle Creek, Michigan]].<ref name=\"baseballinwartime.com\"/> His salary was cut from $55,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|55000|1940|r=-3}}}} today) a year to $21 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|21|1940|r=-2}}}} today) a month.<ref>Rosengren, John.

He graduated from [[Officer Candidate School]] and was commissioned as a [[US First Lieutenant|first lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Air Corps]] (the new \"Air Forces\" service retaining the old name for [[1941 in aviation#June|its own logistics and training elements]]) and was assigned to the Physical Education Program.<ref>National Baseball Hall of Fame, ''\"Baseball in Uniform\"'' http://www.baseballinwartime.com/player_biographies/greenberg_hank.htm Retrieved March 18, 2015</ref> In February 1944, he was sent to the U.S. Army [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] school. Promoted to [[captain]], he requested overseas duty later that year and served in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India Theater]] for over six months, scouting locations for [[B-29]] bomber bases and was a physical training officer with the [[58th Air Division|58th Bomber Wing]]. He was a Special Services officer of the [[XX Bomber Command|20th Bomber Command]], [[20th Air Force]] in China when it began bombing Japan on June 15. He was ordered to New York, and in late 1944, to [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Greenberg served 47 months, the longest of any major league player.<ref>Rosengren, John.  ''Hank Greenberg: The Hero of Heroes'', pages 235-250.</ref>\n\n====Return to baseball====\nGreenberg remained in military uniform until he was placed on the military inactive list and discharged from the U.S. Army on June 14, 1945. He was the first major league player to return to MLB after the war. He returned to the Tigers team, and in his first game back on July 1, he homered. The [[1945 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] scheduled for July 10 had been officially cancelled on April 24 and MLB did not name All-Stars that season due to strict travel restrictions during the last days of the war with Germany and Japan and the ending of World War II. In place of the All-Star Game, seven interleague games were played (eight had been scheduled) on July 9 and 10 to benefit the [[American Red Cross]] and the [[War Relief]] fund. An [[Associated Press]] All-Star roster was named (no game was played) for the AL and NL by a group of their sportswriters that included Greenberg as one of the All-Stars.<ref name= baseball-reference1/><ref name=\"baseball-almanac.com\">Baseball Almanac, \"''1945 All-Star Game''\" http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgbox/yr1945as.shtml Retrieved March 16, 2015</ref><ref>\"''All-Star Game Replaced with Exhibition in 1945''\" [http://www.didthetribewinlastnight.com/blog/2014/07/08/all-star-game-replaced-with-exhibition-in-1945] Retrieved March 16, 2015</ref>\n\nGreenberg, who played left field in 72 games and batted .311 in 1945, helped lead the Tigers to a come-from-behind American League pennant, clinching it with a grand slam home run in the dark\u2014there were no lights in [[Sportsman's Park]] in [[St. Louis]]\u2014ninth inning of the final game of the season. The ump\u2014former Yankee pitching star of the 1920s [[Murderers Row]] team [[George Pipgras]]\u2014supposedly said, \"Sorry Hank, but I'm gonna have to call the game. I can't see the ball.\" Greenberg replied, \"Don't worry, George, I can see it just fine\", so the game continued.{{citation needed|reason=Where did this quotation come from?|date=May 2016}} It ended with Greenberg's grand slam on the next pitch, clinching [[Hal Newhouser]]'s 25th victory of the season.  His home run allowed the Tigers to clinch the pennant and avoid a one-game playoff (that would have been necessary without the win) against the now-second-place Washington Senators. The Tigers went on to beat the Cubs in the [[World Series]] in seven games. Only three home runs were hit in that World Series. [[Phil Cavarretta]] hit a home run for the Cubs in Game One, Greenberg hit a homer in Game Two, where he batted in three runs in a 4\u20131 Tigers win, and he hit a two-run homer in Game Six in the eighth inning that tied the score 8\u20138; the Cubs went on to win that game with a run in the bottom of the 12th.\n\nIn 1946, he returned to peak form and playing at first base. He led the AL in home runs (44) and RBIs (127), both for the fourth time.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> He was second in slugging percentage (.604) and total bases (316) behind [[Ted Williams]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nIn 1947, Greenberg and the Tigers had a lengthy salary dispute. When Greenberg decided to retire rather than play for less, Detroit sold his contract to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. To persuade him not to retire, Pittsburgh made Greenberg the first baseball player to earn over $80,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|80000|1947|r=-3}}}} today) in a season as pure salary (though the exact amount is a matter of some dispute). Team co-owner [[Bing Crosby]] recorded a song, \"Goodbye, Mr. Ball, Goodbye\" with [[Groucho Marx]] and Greenberg to celebrate Greenberg's arrival. The Pirates also reduced the size of [[Forbes Field]]'s cavernous left field, renaming the section \"Greenberg Gardens\" to accommodate Greenberg's pull-hitting style. Greenberg played first base for the Pirates in 1947 and was one of the few opposing players to publicly welcome [[Jackie Robinson]] to the majors.\n\n[[File:Hank Greenberg Pirates.png|thumb|190px|Greenberg with the Pirates in 1947]]\nThat year he also had a chance to mentor a young future Hall-of-Famer, the 24-year-old [[Ralph Kiner]]. Said Greenberg, \"Ralph had a natural home run swing. All he needed was somebody to teach him the value of hard work and self-discipline. Early in the morning on off-days, every chance we got, we worked on hitting.\"<ref>Lawrence Ritter,''The Glory of Their Times'', p. 327</ref>  Kiner would go on to hit 51 home runs that year to lead the National League.\n\nIn his final season of 1947, Greenberg tied for the league lead in walks with 104, with a .408 on-base percentage and finished eighth in the league in home runs and tenth in slugging percentage.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Greenberg became the first major league player to hit 25 or more home runs in a season in each league. [[Johnny Mize]] became the second in 1950.\n\nNevertheless, Greenberg retired as a player to take a front-office post with the Cleveland Indians.  No player had ever retired after a final season in which they hit so many home runs.  Since then, only Ted Williams (1960, 29), [[Dave Kingman]] (1986; 35), [[Mark McGwire]] (2001; 29), [[Barry Bonds]] (2007; 28) and [[David Ortiz]] (2016; 38) have hit as many or more homers in their final season.\n\nThrough 2010, he was first in career home runs and RBIs (ahead of [[Shawn Green]]) and batting average (ahead of [[Ryan Braun]]), and fourth in hits (behind [[Lou Boudreau]]), among all-time Jewish major league baseball players.<ref name=JML>{{cite web|title=Career Batting Leaders through 2010|url=http://www.jewishmajorleaguers.org/|work=Career Leaders|publisher=Jewish Major Leaguers|accessdate=February 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs a fielder, the 193-cm (6-foot-4-inch) Greenberg was awkward and unsure of himself early in his career, but mastered first base through countless hours of practice.  Over the course of his career he demonstrated a higher-than-average fielding percentage and range at first base.  When asked to move to [[left field]] in 1940 to make room for [[Rudy York]], he worked tirelessly to conquer that position as well, reducing his errors in the outfield from 15 in 1940 to 0 in 1945.\n\nGreenberg felt that runs batted in were more important than home runs.  He would tell his teammates, \"just get on base\", or \"just get the runner to third\", and he would do the rest.\n\n====Final seasons====\nGreenberg would likely have approached 500 home runs and 1,800 RBIs had he not served in the military.<ref name=\"bullock2004\">{{cite book | title=Playing for Their Nation: Baseball and the American Military during World War II | publisher=University of Nebraska Press | author=Bullock, Steven R. | page=127 | year=2004 | isbn=0-8032-1337-9}}</ref> As it was, he compiled 331 home runs and 1,276 RBI in a 1,394-game career.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  Greenberg also hit for average, earning a lifetime batting average of .313.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Starring as a first baseman and [[outfielder]] with the Tigers (1930, 1933\u201346) and doing duty only briefly with the Pirates (1947), Greenberg played only nine full seasons.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  He missed all but 19 games of the 1941 season, the three full seasons that followed, and most of 1945 to World War II military service and missed most of another season with a broken wrist.\n\n====Management and ownership====\nAfter the 1947 season, Greenberg retired from the field to become the [[Cleveland Indians]]' farm system director and two years later, their [[General manager (baseball)|General Manager]] and part-owner along with [[Bill Veeck]].  During his tenure, he sponsored more [[African American]] players than any other major league executive.  Greenberg's contributions to the Cleveland farm system led to the team's successes throughout the 1950s, although [[Bill James]] once wrote that the Indians' late 1950s collapse should also be attributed to him.<ref>James, Bill ''The New Bill Janes Historical Baseball Abstract'' New York: Free Press (2001) p. 435 {{ISBN|0-684-80697-5}}</ref> In 1949, [[Larry Doby]] also recommended Greenberg scout three players Doby used to play with in the [[Negro leagues]]: [[Hank Aaron]], [[Ernie Banks]], and [[Willie Mays]]. The next offseason Doby asked what Indians' scouts said about his recommendations. Said Greenberg, \"Our guys checked 'em out and their reports were not good. They said that Aaron has a hitch in his swing and will never hit good pitching. Banks is too slow and didn't have enough range [at shortstop], and Mays can't hit a curveball.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia|edition=Third|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zjLiv-NNsiQC&pg=PA605&lpg=PA605&dq=larry+doby#v=onepage&q=larry%20doby&f=false|last=Schneider|first=Russell|isbn=1582618402|year=2004|publisher=Sports Publishing L.L.C.|location=Champaign, Illinois|page=4}}</ref> When Veeck sold his interest, Greenberg remained as general manager and part-owner until 1957.  He was the mastermind behind a potential move of the club to [[Minneapolis]] that was vetoed by the rest of ownership at the last minute. Greenberg was furious and sold his share soon afterwards.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 1959, Greenberg and Veeck teamed up for a second time when their syndicate purchased the [[Chicago White Sox]]; Veeck served as team president with Greenberg as vice president and general manager. During Veeck and Greenberg's first season, the White Sox won their first AL pennant since 1919. Veeck would sell his shares in the White Sox in 1961, and Greenberg stepped down as general manager on August 26 of that season.<ref name=sabrbio/>\n\nAfter the [[1960 in baseball|1960 season]], the American League announced plans to put a team in Los Angeles.  Greenberg immediately became the favorite to become the new team's first owner and persuaded Veeck to join him as his partner.  However, when [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] owner [[Walter O'Malley]] got wind of these developments, he threatened to scuttle the whole deal by invoking his exclusive rights to operate a major league team in southern California.  In truth, O'Malley wanted no part of competing against an expansion team owned by a master promoter such as Veeck, even if he was only a minority partner.  Greenberg wouldn't budge and pulled out of the running for what became the Los Angeles Angels (now the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]]).  Greenberg later became a successful [[investment banker]], briefly returning to baseball as a minority partner with Veeck when the latter repurchased the White Sox in 1975.\n\n==Personal life==\nGreenberg married Caral Gimbel (daughter of [[Bernard Gimbel]] of the [[Gimbel's]] New York department store family) on February 18, 1946, three days after signing a $60,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|60000|1946|r=-3}}}} today) contract with the Tigers. The couple had three children\u2014sons [[Glenn H. Greenberg]] and Stephen and a daughter, Alva\u2014before divorcing in 1958.

He was an [[advocate]] of the historicity of places mentioned in the works of [[Homer]] and an archaeological excavator of [[Hisarlik]], now presumed to be the site of [[Troy]], along with the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] sites [[Mycenae]] and [[Tiryns]]. His work lent weight to the idea that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' reflects [[Historicity of the Iliad|historical events]]. Schliemann's excavation of nine levels of archaeological remains with dynamite has been criticized as destructive of significant historical artifacts, including the level that is believed to be the historical Troy.<ref name=\"Stefan Lovgren\">{{cite web|author=Stefan Lovgren |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/05/0514_040514_troy.html |title=National Geographic News |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref>\n\nAlong with [[Arthur Evans]], Schliemann was a pioneer in the study of [[Aegean civilization]] in the [[Bronze Age]]. The two men knew of each other, Evans having visited Schliemann's sites. Schliemann had planned to excavate at [[Knossos]] but died before fulfilling that dream. Evans bought the site and stepped in to take charge of the project, which was then still in its infancy.\n\n==Childhood and youth==\nSchliemann was born in [[Neubukow]], [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] (part of the [[German Confederation]]), in 1822. His father, Ernst Schliemann, was a Lutheran [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]. The family moved to [[Ankershagen]] in 1823 (today their home houses the ''Heinrich Schliemann Museum'').<ref>{{cite web|author=Cornelia Mau\u00e9, www.cornelia-maue.de |url=http://www.schliemann-museum.de/hsm/anliegen.html |title=website of schliemann-museum Ankershagen |publisher=Schliemann-museum.de |accessdate=2012-08-10}}</ref>\n\nHeinrich's father was a poor Pastor. His mother, Luise Therese Sophie Schliemann, died in 1831, when Heinrich was nine years old. After his mother's death, his father sent Heinrich to live with his uncle. When he was eleven years old, his father paid for him to enroll in the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (grammar school) at [[Neustrelitz]]. Heinrich's later interest in history was initially encouraged by his father, who had schooled him in the tales of the [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]] and had given him a copy of Ludwig Jerrer's ''Illustrated History of the World'' for Christmas in 1829. Schliemann later claimed that at the age of 7 he had declared he would one day excavate the city of [[Troy]].<ref name=\"Ilios\">{{cite book |last = Schliemann |first = Heinrich |title = Ilios: The City and Country of the Trojans: the Results of Researches and Discoveries on the Site of Troy and Through the Troad in the Years 1871-72-73-78-79; Including an Autobiography of the Author| publisher= [[Harper (publisher)#Harper & Brothers 1833\u20131962)| Harper & Brothers]] |year = 1881| page= 3}}</ref><ref name=\"Cottrell\">{{cite book |last= Cottrell |first= Leonard |authorlink= Leonard Cottrell| title= The Bull of Minos: The discoveries of Schliemann and Evans| publisher= [[George Bell & Sons#History|Bell & Hyman Ltd]] |year = 1984| isbn= 978-0-7135-2432-1| page= 36}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Heinrich had to transfer to the [[Realschule]] (vocational school) after his father was accused of embezzling church funds<ref>Robert Payne, ''The Gold of Troy: The Story of Heinrich Schliemann and the Buried Cities of Ancient Greece'', 1959, repr.

His family's poverty made a university education impossible, so it was Schliemann's early academic experiences that influenced the course of his education as an adult. In his archaeological career, however, there was often a division between Schliemann and the educated professionals.\n\nAt age 14, after leaving Realschule, Heinrich became an apprentice at Herr Holtz's grocery in [[F\u00fcrstenberg/Havel|F\u00fcrstenberg]]. He later told that his passion for Homer was born when he heard a drunkard reciting it at the grocer's.<ref>Payne, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=o_A8TISuD4n0tgOB3vnaCg&ct=result&id=G1TPdd9JCr8C&dq=Heinrich+Schliemann+embezzled&q=reciting+Homer#search_anchor p. 70].</ref> He laboured for five years, until he was forced to leave because he burst a blood vessel lifting a heavy barrel.<ref>\"Schliemann, Heinrich\" in [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]], [http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Schliemann,_Heinrich at de.wikisource]. {{de icon}}</ref> In 1841, Schliemann moved to [[Hamburg]] and became a cabin boy on the ''Dorothea,'' a steamer bound for [[Venezuela]].

H. Schr\u00f6der & Co., an import/export firm. In 1846, the firm sent him as a [[General Agent]] to [[St. Petersburg]].\n\nIn time, Schliemann represented a number of companies. He learned Russian and Greek, employing a system that he used his entire life to learn languages; Schliemann claimed that it took him six weeks to learn a language<ref>Payne, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=o_A8TISuD4n0tgOB3vnaCg&ct=result&id=G1TPdd9JCr8C&dq=Heinrich+Schliemann+embezzled&q=languages#search_anchor p. 30].</ref> and wrote his diary in the language of whatever country he happened to be in. By the end of his life, he could converse in English, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Polish, Italian, Greek, Latin, Russian, Arabic, and Turkish as well as German.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nSchliemann's ability with languages was an important part of his career as a businessman in the importing trade. In 1850, he learned of the death of his brother, Ludwig, who had become wealthy as a speculator in the California gold fields.\n\nSchliemann went to California in early 1851 and started a bank in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] buying and reselling over a million dollars' worth of gold dust in just six months. When the local Rothschild agent complained about short-weight consignments he left California, pretending it was because of illness.<ref name=Allen/> While he was there, California became the 31st state in September 1850, and Schliemann acquired United States citizenship. While this story was propounded in Schliemann's autobiography of 1881, Christo Thanos and Wout Arentzen,<ref>''Schliemann and The California Gold Rush,''Leiden, Sidestone Press, 2014, {{ISBN|978-90-8890-255-0}}, pp. 46\u201347</ref> state clearly that Schliemann was in St Petersburg that day, and \"in actual fact, ...obtained his American citizenship only in 1869.\"\n\nAccording to his memoirs, before arriving in California he dined in [[Washington, D.C.]] with President [[Millard Fillmore]] and his family,<ref>Leo Deuel, ''Memoirs of Heinrich Schliemann: A Documentary Portrait Drawn from his Autobiographical Writings, Letters, and Excavation Reports'', New York: Harper, 1977, {{ISBN|0-06-011106-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0DNoAAAAMAAJ&dq=Heinrich+Schliemann+embezzled&q=President#search_anchor p. 67]; he also mentions meeting President [[Andrew Johnson]], p. 126.</ref> but [[Eric H. Cline|Eric Cline]] says that Schliemann didn't attend but simply read about it in the papers.\n\nSchliemann also published what he said was an eyewitness account of the [[San Francisco Fire of 1851]], which he said was in June although it took place in May. At the time he was in Sacramento and used the report of the fire in the ''[[Sacramento Daily Journal]]'' to write his report.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nOn April 7, 1852, he sold his business and returned to Russia. There he attempted to live the life of a gentleman, which brought him into contact with Ekaterina Lyschin, the niece of one of his wealthy friends. Schliemann had previously learned that his childhood sweetheart, Minna, had married.\n\nHeinrich and Ekaterina married on October 12, 1852. The marriage was troubled from the start.\n\nSchliemann next [[cornering the market|cornered the market]] in [[indigo dye]] and then went into the indigo business itself, turning a good profit.

He cornered the market in saltpeter, sulfur, and lead, constituents of ammunition, which he resold to the Russian government.\n\nBy 1858, Schliemann was 36 years old and wealthy enough to retire. In his memoirs, he claimed that he wished to dedicate himself to the pursuit of Troy.\n\nAs a consequence of his many travels, Schliemann was often separated from his wife and small children. He spent a month studying at the [[Sorbonne]] in 1866, while moving his assets from St. Petersburg to Paris to invest in real estate. He asked his wife to join him, but she refused.{{sfn|Allen, p. 114}}\n\nSchliemann threatened to divorce Ekaterina twice before doing so.  In 1869, he bought property and settled in [[Indianapolis]] for about three months to take advantage of [[Indiana]]'s liberal divorce laws. although he obtained the divorce by lying about his residency in the U.S. and his intention to remain in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.newspapers.library.in.gov/so-she-went-heinrich-schliemann-came-to-marion-county-for-a-copper-bottom-divorce/|title='So She Went': Heinrich Schliemann Came to Marion County for a \"Copper Bottom Divorce\"|date=11 March 2015|publisher=}}</ref>  He moved to Athens as soon as an Indiana court granted him the divorce and married again three months later.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Life as an archaeologist==\nSchliemann's first interest of a classical nature seems to have been the location of Troy.

The Turkish government owned the western half. Calvert became Schliemann's collaborator and partner.\n\n[[Image:MaskeAgamemnon.JPG|thumb|The '[[Mask of Agamemnon]]', discovered by Heinrich Schliemann in 1876 at [[Mycenae]] now exhibited at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]].]]\n\nSchliemann needed an assistant who was knowledgeable in matters pertaining to Greek culture. As he had divorced Ekaterina in 1869, he advertised for a wife in a newspaper in Athens. A friend, the Archbishop of Athens, suggested a relative of his, 17-year-old [[Sophia Schliemann|Sophia Engastromenos]] (1852\u20131932). Schliemann, age 47, married her in October 1869, despite the 30 year difference in age. They later had two children, Andromache and [[Agamemnon Schliemann]]; he reluctantly allowed them to be baptized, but solemnized the ceremony in his own way by placing a copy of the ''[[Iliad]]'' on the children's heads and reciting 100 hexameters.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nSchliemann began work on Troy in 1871. His excavations began before archaeology had developed as a professional field. Thinking that Homeric Troy must be in the lowest level, Schliemann and his workers dug hastily through the upper levels, reaching fortifications that he took to be his target. In 1872, he and Calvert fell out over this method. Schliemann was angry when Calvert published an article stating that the Trojan War period was missing from the site's archaeological record.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nSchliemann was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1880.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlists|title=MemberListS|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Priam's Treasure===\n[[Image:Sophia schliemann treasure.jpg|left|thumb|Sophia Schliemann (n\u00e9e Engastromenos) wearing treasures recovered at [[Hisarlik]]]]\nA cache of gold and other objects appeared on or around May 27, 1873; Schliemann named it \"[[Priam's Treasure]]\". He later wrote that he had seen the gold glinting in the dirt and dismissed the workmen so that he and Sophia could excavate it themselves; they removed it in her shawl. However, Schliemann's oft-repeated story of the treasure's being carried by Sophia in her shawl was untrue. Schliemann later admitted fabricating it; at the time of the discovery Sophia was in fact with her family in Athens, following the death of her father.<ref>Moorehead, Caroline, The Lost Treasures of Troy (1994) page 133, {{ISBN|0-297-81500-8}}</ref> Sophia later wore \"the Jewels of Helen\" for the public.

Collaborating with Calvert, Schliemann smuggled the treasure out of Turkey. He defended his \"smuggling\" in Turkey as an attempt to protect the items from corrupt local officials. [[Priam's Treasure]] today remains a subject of international dispute.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nSchliemann published ''Troja und seine Ruinen'' (''Troy and Its Ruins'') in 1875 and began excavation of the [[Treasury of Minyas]] at [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)]] in 1880.<ref>{{cite web|title=The scientific work|url=https://www.mthv.gr/en/the-museum/the-scientific-work/|publisher=[[Archaeological Museum of Thebes]]|accessdate=2017-11-23}}</ref> In 1876, he began digging at [[Mycenae]]. Upon discovering the [[Grave Circle A, Mycenae|Shaft Graves]], with their skeletons and more regal gold (including the so-called [[Mask of Agamemnon]]), Schliemann cabled the king of Greece. The results were published in ''Mykenai'' in 1878.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAlthough he had received permission in 1876 to continue excavation, Schliemann did not reopen the dig site at Troy until 1878\u20131879, after another excavation in Ithaca designed to locate a site mentioned in the ''[[Odyssey]]''. This was his second excavation at Troy. [[Emile Burnouf]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]] joined him there in 1879. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nSchliemann made a third excavation at Troy in 1882\u20131883, an excavation of [[Tiryns]] with [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]] in 1884, and a fourth excavation at Troy, also with D\u00f6rpfeld (who emphasized the importance of strata), in 1888\u20131890.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SWICDATt3wQC&pg=PA56&dq=%22Schliemann%22+%22D%C3%B6rpfeld%22+%221888%22#v=onepage&q=%22Schliemann%22+%22D%C3%B6rpfeld%22+%221888%22&f=false|title=Troy|last=Kerns|first=Ann|date=2008-09-01|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=9780822575825|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[Image:Schliemann grave.jpg|thumb|Schliemann's grave in the [[First Cemetery of Athens]].]]\n[[File:Schliemann mansion 1900.png|thumb|The Schliemann mansion in [[Athens]], ca. 1910, now housing the [[Numismatic Museum of Athens]]]]\nOn August 1, 1890, Schliemann returned reluctantly to [[Athens]], and in November travelled to [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], where his chronic ear infection was operated upon, on November 13. The doctors deemed the operation a success, but his inner ear became painfully inflamed. Ignoring his doctors' advice, he left the hospital and travelled to [[Leipzig]], [[Berlin]], and [[Paris]]. From the latter, he planned to return to [[Athens]] in time for [[Christmas]], but his ear condition became even worse. Too sick to make the boat ride from [[Naples]] to [[Greece]], Schliemann remained in Naples but managed to make a journey to the ruins of [[Pompeii]]. On [[Christmas Day]] 1890, he collapsed into a coma; he died in a Naples hotel room the following day; the cause of death was [[cholesteatoma]].\n\nHis corpse was then transported by friends to the [[First Cemetery of Athens|First Cemetery]] in Athens. It was interred in a [[mausoleum]] shaped like a temple erected in ancient Greek style, designed by [[Ernst Ziller]] in the form of a [[pediment]]al sculpture. The [[frieze]] circling the outside of the mausoleum shows Schliemann conducting the excavations at Mycenae and other sites.\n\nSchliemann's magnificent residence in the city centre of Athens, the ''Iliou Melathron'' (\u0399\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \"Palace of [[Troy|Ilium]]\") houses today the [[Numismatic Museum of Athens]].\n\n==Criticisms==\nFurther excavation of the [[Troy]] site by others indicated that the level he named the Troy of the ''[[Iliad]]'' was inaccurate, although they retain the names given by Schliemann.

Easton wrote that Schliemann \"was not very good at separating fact from interpretation\"<ref name=\"Easton 1998 341\">{{cite journal|last=Easton |first=D.F. |title=Heinrich Schliemann: Hero or Fraud?|journal=The Classical World |volume=91 |date=May\u2013June 1998| page=341|doi=10.2307/4352102|issue=5|jstor=4352102 }}</ref> and claimed that, \"Even in 1872 Frank Calvert could see from the pottery that Troy II had to be hundreds of years too early to be the Troy of the Trojan War, a point finally proven by the discovery of Mycenaean pottery in Troy VI in 1890.\"<ref name=\"Easton 1998 341\"/>\n\"King Priam's Treasure\" was found in the Troy II level, that of the Early Bronze Age, long before Priam's city of Troy VI or Troy VIIa in the prosperous and elaborate Mycenaean Age. Moreover, the finds were unique.

[[Kenneth W. Harl]], in the Teaching Company's ''Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor'' lecture series, sarcastically claimed that Schliemann's excavations were carried out with such rough methods that he did to Troy what the Greeks could not do in their times, destroying and levelling down the entire city walls to the ground.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=363| title=Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor| author=Kenneth W.

Other investigators followed, such as Professor David Traill of the University of California.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAn article published by the [[National Geographic Society]] called into question Schliemann's qualifications, his motives, and his methods:\n\n:''In northwestern Turkey, Heinrich Schliemann excavated the site believed to be Troy in 1870. Schliemann was a German adventurer and con man who took sole credit for the discovery, even though he was digging at the site, called Hisarlik, at the behest of British archaeologist Frank Calvert. ... Eager to find the legendary treasures of Troy, Schliemann blasted his way down to the second city, where he found what he believed were the jewels that once belonged to Helen. As it turns out, the jewels were a thousand years older than the time described in Homer's epic.''<ref name=\"Stefan Lovgren\"/>\n\nAnother article presented similar criticisms when reporting on a speech by University of Pennsylvania scholar C. Brian Rose:\n\n:''German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann was the first to explore the Mound of Troy in the 1870s. Unfortunately, he had had no formal education in archaeology, and dug an enormous trench \u201cwhich we still call the Schliemann Trench,\u201d according to Rose, because in the process Schliemann \u201cdestroyed a phenomenal amount of material.\u201d ... Only much later in his career would he accept the fact that the treasure had been found at a layer one thousand years removed from the battle between the Greeks and Trojans, and thus that it could not have been the treasure of King Priam. Schliemann may not have discovered the truth, but the publicity stunt worked, making Schliemann and the site famous and igniting the field of Homeric studies in the late 19th century.''<ref>{{cite web|author=Lauren Stokes |url=http://daily.swarthmore.edu/2005/11/23/trojan-wars-and-tourism-a-lecture-by-c-brian-rose/ |title=Trojan wars and tourism: a lecture by C.

Hypnos was able to trick him and help the Danaans win the Trojan war. During the war, Hera loathed her brother and husband, Zeus, so she devised a plot to trick him. She decided that in order to trick him she needed to make him so enamoured with her that he would fall for the trick. So she washed herself with ambrosia and anointed herself with oil, made especially for her to make herself impossible to resist for Zeus. She wove flowers through her hair, put on three brilliant pendants for earrings, and donned a wondrous robe. She then called for [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love, and asked her for a charm that would ensure that her trick would not fail. In order to procure the charm, however, she lied to Aphrodite because they sided on opposites sides of the war. She told Aphrodite that she wanted the charm to help herself and Zeus stop fighting. Aphrodite willingly agreed. Hera was almost ready to trick Zeus, but she needed the help of Hypnos, who had tricked Zeus once before.\n\nHera called on Hypnos and asked him to help her by putting Zeus to sleep. Hypnos was reluctant because the last time he had put the god to sleep, he was furious when he awoke. It was Hera who had asked him to trick Zeus the first time as well. She was furious that [[Heracles]], Zeus' son, sacked the city of the Trojans. So she had Hypnos put Zeus to sleep, and set blasts of angry winds upon the sea while Heracles was still sailing home. When Zeus awoke he was furious and went on a rampage looking for Hypnos. Hypnos managed to avoid Zeus by hiding with his mother, Nyx. This made Hypnos reluctant to accept Hera's proposal and help her trick Zeus again. Hera first offered him a beautiful golden seat that can never fall apart and a footstool to go with it. He refused this first offer, remembering the last time he tricked Zeus. Hera finally got him to agree by promising that he would be married to Pasithea, one of the youngest Graces, whom he had always wanted to marry. Hypnos made her swear by the [[river Styx]] and call on gods of the underworld to be witnesses so that he would be ensured that he would marry Pasithea.\n\nHera went to see Zeus on Gargarus, the topmost peak of [[Mount Ida]]. Zeus was extremely taken by her and suspected nothing as Hypnos was shrouded in a thick mist and hidden upon a pine tree that was close to where Hera and Zeus were talking. Zeus asked Hera what she was doing there and why she had come from Olympus, and she told him the same lie she told Aphrodite. She told him that she wanted to go help her parent stop quarrelling and she stopped there to consult him because she didn't want to go without his knowledge and have him be angry with her when he found out. Zeus said that she could go any time, and that she should postpone her visit and stay there with him so they could enjoy each other's company. He told her that he was never in love with anyone as much as he loved her at that moment. He took her in his embrace and Hypnos went to work putting him to sleep, with Hera in his arms. While this went on, Hypnos travelled to the ships of the Achaeans to tell [[Poseidon]], God of the Sea, that he could now help the Danaans and give them a victory while Zeus was sleeping. This is where Hypnos leaves the story, leaving Poseidon eager to help the Danaans. Thanks to Hypnos helping to trick Zeus, the war changed its course to Hera's favour, and Zeus never found out that Hypnos had tricked him one more time.<ref>Homer. The Iliad. Trans. Robert Fagles.

The [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] tradition within Anglicanism identifies more with the Roman Catholic position about the sacramental nature of ordination.\n\n[[Christian denomination|Denominations]] have varied conceptions of holy orders. In the Anglican churches and some Lutheran churches the traditional orders of bishop, priest and deacon are bestowed using ordination rites. The extent to which ordination is considered sacramental in these traditions has, however, been a matter of some internal dispute. Baptists are among the denominations that do not consider [[Minister of religion|ministry]] as being sacramental in nature<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpnews.net/20599/how-do-catholics-and-baptists-differ|title=How do Catholics & Baptists differ?|last=Weeks|first=Lee|website=www.bpnews.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}</ref> and would not think of it in terms of \"holy orders\" as such. Historically, the word \"order\" (Latin ''[[:wikt:ordo|ordo]]'') designated an established civil body or corporation with a hierarchy, and ''[[:wikt:ordinatio|ordinatio]]'' meant legal incorporation into an ''ordo''. The word \"holy\" refers to the [[Ecclesia (Church)|Church]]. In context, therefore, a holy order is set apart for ministry in the Church. Other positions, such as [[pope]], [[patriarch]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], [[monsignor]], [[archbishop]], [[archimandrite]], [[archpriest]], [[protopresbyter]], [[hieromonk]], [[protodeacon]] and [[archdeacon]], are not sacramental orders but specialized ministries.\n\n==Eastern Christianity==\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Russian Orthodox Episcopal Ordination.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Patriarch Alexius II|Alexius II]], [[Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia]], together with other bishops, conferring the holy order of [[bishop]] upon a Russian Orthodox [[Hieromonk|priest-monk (hieromonk)]].]] -->\n[[File:Cheirotonia Presbyter 1.jpeg|thumb|300px|Metropolitan [[Hilarion (Kapral)]] performs the laying on of hands (''[[Christian laying on of hands|Cheirotonia]]''), conferring the holy order of [[presbyter|presbyter (priest)]] upon an Orthodox [[deacon]].]]\n[[File:Cheirotonia Presbyter Pledge of Holy Mysteries.jpeg|thumb|300px|After the transmutation of the Holy Gifts, the bishop presents to the newly ordained priest a portion of the Lamb (i.e., the Body of Christ)\"]]\n[[File:Kheirotonia.jpg|thumb|300px|The laying on of hands (''[[Christian laying on of hands|Cheirotonia]]''), conferring the holy order of [[deacon]] upon an Orthodox [[subdeacon]].]]\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] considers ordination (known as ''[[Christian laying on of hands|Cheirotonia]]'', \"[[laying on of hands]]\") to be a [[Sacred Mystery]] (what in the West is called a sacrament).  Although all other mysteries may be performed by a presbyter, ordination may only be conferred by a bishop, and ordination of a bishop may only be performed by several bishops together. Cheirotonia always takes place during the [[Divine Liturgy]].\n\nIt was the mission of the [[Apostles]] to go forth into all the world and preach the [[Gospel]], baptizing those who believed in the name of the [[Holy Trinity]] ({{bibleverse||Matthew|28:18\u201320|KJV}}). In the [[Early Church]] those who presided over congregations were referred to variously as ''[[bishop|episcopos]]'' (bishop) or ''[[presbyter]]os'' (priest). These successors of the [[Apostles]] were ordained to their office by the [[laying on of hands]], and according to [[Orthodox theology]] formed a living, organic link with the Apostles, and through them with [[Jesus Christ]] himself.<ref name=\"SL\">{{Citation\n |last=Williams\n |first=Father Gregory\n|author-link =\n|last2=\n|first2=\n|author2-link=\n|contribution =\n |year=1979\n|publication-date=1986\n |title=The Sacramental Life: An Orthodox Christian Perspective\n|editor-last =\n|editor-first =\n|editor-link=\n|edition=3rd\n |volume=\n|series =\n |pages=43\u201347\n|place =Liberty TN\n |publisher=St. John of Kronstadt Press\n |id=\n |isbn=\n |url=\n |accessdate=}}\n</ref> This link is believed to continue in [[Apostolic succession|unbroken succession]] to this day. Over time, the ministry of bishops (who hold the fullness of the priesthood) and presbyters or priests (who hold a portion of the priesthood as bestowed by their bishop) came to be distinguished. In Orthodox terminology, ''priesthood'' or ''sacerdotal'' refers to the ministry of bishops and priests.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church also has ordination to [[minor orders]] (known as ''[[cheirothesia]]'', \"imposition of hands\") which is performed outside of the Divine Liturgy, typically by a bishop, although certain [[archimandrite]]s of [[stavropegial]] monasteries may bestow cheirothesia on members of their communities.\n\nA '''bishop''' is the Teacher of the Faith, the carrier of [[Sacred Tradition]], and the living Vessel of Grace through whom the ''[[energeia]]'' ([[divine grace]]) of the Holy Spirit flows into the rest of the church.<ref name=\"SL\"/> A bishop is [[consecrated]] through the laying on of hands by several bishops.  (With the consent of several other bishops, a single bishop has performed the ordination of another bishop in emergency situations, such as times of [[persecution of Christianity|persecution]]), The consecration of a bishop takes place near the beginning of the Liturgy, since a bishop can, in addition to performing the Mystery of the Eucharist, also ordain priests and deacons.  Before the commencement of the Holy Liturgy, the bishop-elect professes, in the middle of the church before the seated bishops who will consecrate him, in detail the doctrines of the Orthodox Christian Faith and pledges to observe the canons of the Apostles and Councils, the [[Typikon]] and customs of the Orthodox Church and to obey ecclesiastical authority.  After the [[Little Entrance]], the arch-priest and arch-deacon conduct the bishop-elect before the Royal Gates where he is met by the bishops and kneels before the altar on both knees. The [[Gospel Book]] is laid over his head and the [[consecrator|consecrating bishops]] lay their hands upon the Gospel Book, while the prayers of ordination are read by the eldest bishop. After this, the newly consecrated bishop ascends the ''[[kathedra|synthranon]]'' (bishop's throne in the sanctuary) for the first time.<ref name=\"DS\">{{Citation\n|last=Sokolof\n|first=Archpriest Dimitrii\n|author-link =\n|last2=\n|first2=\n|author2-link=\n|contribution =\n|year=1899\n|publication-date=2001\n|title=Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services\n|editor-last =\n|editor-first =\n|editor-link=\n|edition=\n|volume=\n|series =\n|page=166\n|place =Jordanville, New York\n|publisher=[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n|id=\n|isbn=0-88465-067-7\n|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/sokolof/services.toc.html\n|accessdate=}}</ref>  Customarily, the newly consecrated bishop ordains a priest and a deacon at the Liturgy during which he is consecrated.\n\nA '''priest''' may serve only at the pleasure of his bishop. A bishop bestows [[Faculty (instrument)|faculties]] (permission to minister within his [[diocese]]) giving a priest [[Chrism#Eastern Christianity|chrism]] and an [[antimins]]; he may withdraw faculties and demand the return of these items.  The [[ordination]] of a priest occurs before the [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphora (Eucharistic Prayer)]] in order that he may on the same day take part in the celebration of the Eucharist:<ref name=\"DS\"/>  During the [[Great Entrance]], the candidate for ordination carries the [[A\u00ebr]] ([[chalice (cup)|chalice]] [[veil]]) over his head (rather than on his shoulder, as a deacon otherwise carries it then) as a symbol of giving up his diaconate, and comes last in the [[procession]] and stands at the end of the pair of lines of the priests. After the A\u00ebr is taken from the candidate to cover the chalice and [[diskos]], a chair is brought for the bishop to sit on by the northeast corner of the [[Holy Table]] (altar).  Two deacons go to priest-elect who, at that point, had been standing alone in the middle of the church, and bow him down to the west (to the people) and to the east (to the clergy), asking their consent by saying \u201cCommand ye!\u201d and then lead him through the holy doors of the altar where the archdeacon asks the bishop\u2019s consent, saying, \u201cCommand, most sacred master!\u201d after which a priest escorts the candidate three times around the Holy Table, during which he kisses each corner of the Holy Table as well as the bishop's [[epigonation]] and right hand and prostrates himself before the holy table at each circuit. The candidate is then taken to the southeast corner of the Holy Table and kneels on both knees, resting his forehead on the edge of the Holy Table. The ordaining bishop then places his [[omophor]] and right hand over the ordinand's head and recites aloud the first ''Prayer of Cheirotonia'' and then prays silently the other two prayers of cheirotonia while a deacon quietly recites a [[litany]] and the clergy, then the congregation, chant \u201cLord, have mercy\u201d. Afterwards, the bishop brings the newly ordained priest to stand in the [[Holy Doors]] and presents him to the faithful. He then clothes the priest in each of his sacerdotal [[vestments]], at each of which the people sing, ''[[Axios (acclamation)|Worthy]]!''. Later, after the [[Epiklesis]] of the Liturgy, the bishop hands him a portion of the [[Lamb (liturgy)|Lamb]] ([[Host (liturgy)|Host]]) saying:<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hapgood |first=Isabel F. |year=1922|publication-date=1975 |title=Service Book of the Holy Orthodox-Catholic Apostolic Church|edition=5th |page=106|place =Englewood NJ |publisher=[[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese]] |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n{{Quote|Receive thou this pledge, and preserve it whole and unharmed until thy last breath, because thou shalt be held to an accounting therefore in the second and terrible Coming of our great Lord, God, and Saviour, Jesus Christ.}}\n\nA '''deacon''' may not perform any Sacrament and performs no liturgical services on his own but serves only as an assistant to a priest and may not even vest without the blessing of a priest.  The ordination of a deacon occurs after the Anaphora (Eucharistic Prayer) since his role is not in performing the Holy Mystery but consists only in serving;<ref name=\"DS\"/> the ceremony is much the same as at the ordination of a priest, but the deacon-elect is presented to the people and escorted to the holy doors by two sub-deacons (his peers, analogous to the two deacons who so present a priest-elect) is escorted three times around the Holy Table by a deacon, and he kneels on only one knee during the ''Prayer of Cheirotonia''. After being vested as a deacon and given a ''[[Hexapteryga#Eastern Christianity|liturgical fan (ripidion or hexapterygion)]]'', he is led to the side of the Holy Table where he uses the ripidion to gently fan the Holy Gifts (consecrated [[Eucharist|Body and Blood of Christ]]).\n\n==Anglicanism==\nThe [[Anglican]] churches hold their bishops to be in [[apostolic succession]], although there is some difference of opinion with regard to whether ordination is to be regarded as a sacrament. The Anglican [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]] hold that only Baptism and the Lord's Supper are to be counted as sacraments of the gospel, and assert that other rites \"commonly called Sacraments\", considered to be sacraments by such as the Roman Catholic and Eastern churches, were not ordained by Christ in the Gospel. They do not have the nature of a sacrament of the gospel in the absence of any physical matter such as the water in Baptism and the bread and wine in the Eucharist. The [[Book of Common Prayer]] provides rites for ordination of bishops, priests and deacons. Only bishops may ordain. Within Anglicanism, three bishops are normally required for ordination to the episcopate, while one bishop is sufficient for performing ordinations to the priesthood and diaconate.\n\n==Lutheranism==\n[[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] reject the Roman Catholic understanding of holy orders because they do not think [[sacerdotalism]] is supported by the Bible. [[Martin Luther]] taught that each individual was expected to fulfill his God-appointed task in everyday life. The modern usage of the term [[vocation]] as a life-task was first employed by Martin Luther.<ref>[[Max Weber]], ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'', trans. Talcott Parsons, Ch.3, p. 79 & note 1.</ref> In [[Luther's Small Catechism]], the holy orders include but are not limited to the following: bishops, pastors, preachers, governmental offices, citizens, husbands, wives, children, employees, employers, young people, and [[widow]]s.<ref>See [http://www.bookofconcord.org/smallcatechism.php#tableofduties Luther's Small Catechism]</ref> However, also according to the [[Book of Concord]]: \"But if ordination be understood as applying to the ministry of the Word, we are not unwilling to call ordination a sacrament. For the ministry of the Word has God's command and glorious promises, Rom. 1:16: The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. Likewise, Isa. 55:11: So shall My Word be that goeth forth out of My mouth; it shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please. 12.] If ordination be understood in this way, neither will we refuse to call the imposition of hands a sacrament. For the Church has the command to appoint ministers, which should be most pleasing to us, because we know that God approves this ministry, and is present in the ministry [that God will preach and work through men and those who have been chosen by men].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bookofconcord.org/defense_12_sacraments.php|title=Defense of the Augsburg Confession - Book of Concord|website=bookofconcord.org|access-date=2018-10-16}}</ref>\n\n==Roman Catholicism==\n:''See: [[Holy orders (Catholic Church)]], [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)]] and [[Bishop (Catholic Church)]]''\n[[File:Holy Orders Picture.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Ordination]] to the Catholic priesthood (Latin rite).

Pictured is the third imposition of hands as in the pre-1968 [[Roman Pontifical]], in 1999, [[France]].]]\n\nThe sequence in which holy orders are received are: minor orders, deacon, priest, bishop.\n\nFor Catholics, it is typical in the year of [[seminary]] training that a man will be ordained to the diaconate, which Catholics since the Second Vatican Council sometimes call the \"transitional diaconate\" to distinguish men bound for priesthood from [[permanent deacon]]s. They are licensed to preach sermons (under certain circumstances a permanent deacon may not receive faculties to preach), to perform [[baptism]]s, and to witness [[Catholic marriage]]s, but to perform no other sacraments. They assist at the [[Eucharist]] or the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], but are not able to consecrate the bread and wine. Normally, after six months or more as a transitional deacon, a man will be ordained to the priesthood. Priests are able to [[preach]], perform [[baptism]]s, [[confirmation|confirm]] (with special dispensation from their ordinary), witness marriages, hear [[Confession (religion)|confessions]] and give [[absolution]]s, [[unction|anoint the sick]], and celebrate the [[Eucharist]] or the Mass.\n\nOrthodox seminarians are typically [[tonsure]]d as [[Reader (liturgy)|readers]] before entering seminary, and may later be made subdeacons or deacons; customs vary between seminaries and between Orthodox jurisdictions. Some deacons remain permanently in the diaconate while most subsequently are ordained as priests.  Orthodox clergy are typically either married or [[Monasticism|monastic]]. Monastic deacons are called [[hierodeacon]]s, monastic priests are called [[hieromonk]]s. Orthodox clergy who marry must do so prior to ordination to the subdiaconate (or diaconate, according to local custom) and typically one is either tonsured a monk or married before ordination. A deacon or priest may not marry, or remarry if widowed, without abandoning his clerical office. Often, widowed priests take [[monastic vows]]. Orthodox bishops are always monks; a single or widowed man may be elected a bishop but he must be tonsured a monk before consecration as a bishop.\n\nFor Anglicans, a person is usually ordained a [[deacon]] once he (or she) has completed training at a theological college. The historic practice of a bishop tutoring a candidate himself (\"reading for orders\") is still to be found. The candidate then typically serves as an assistant [[curate]] and may later be ordained as a [[priest]] at the discretion of the bishop. Other deacons may choose to remain in this order.  Anglican deacons can preach sermons, perform [[baptism]]s and conduct funerals, but, unlike priests, cannot celebrate the [[Eucharist]]. In most branches of the Anglican church, women can be ordained as priests, and in some of them, can also be ordained [[bishop]]s.\n\n[[File:Ordination sacerdotale.jpg|thumb|right|Anointment of the hands of a newly ordained priest.]]\n\n[[Bishop]]s are chosen from among priests in churches that adhere to Catholic usage.\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, bishops, like priests, are celibate and thus unmarried; further, a bishop is said to possess the fullness of the sacrament of holy orders, empowering him to ordain deacons, priests, and \u2013 with papal consent \u2013 other bishops. If a bishop, especially one acting as an ordinary \u2013 a head of a diocese or archdiocese \u2013 is to be ordained, three bishops must usually co-consecrate him with one bishop, usually an archbishop or the bishop of the place, being the chief consecrating prelate.\n\nAmong Eastern Rite Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, which permit married priests, bishops must either be unmarried or agree to abstain from contact with their wives. It is a common misconception that all such bishops come from [[religious orders]]; while this is generally true, it is not an absolute rule. In the case of both Catholics \u2013 (Western and) Eastern Catholic, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox, they are usually leaders of territorial units called [[diocese]]s (or its equivalent in the east, an [[eparchy]]).  Only bishops can validly administer the sacrament of holy orders.\n\n===Recognition of other churches' orders===\nThe Roman Catholic Church unconditionally recognizes the validity of ordinations in the Eastern churches. Some Eastern Orthodox churches reordain Catholic priests who convert while others accept their Roman Catholic ordination using the concept of [[Economy (Eastern Orthodoxy)|economia (church economy)]].\n\n[[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches claim to have maintained apostolic succession.<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/patriarc.htm The Ecumenical Patriarch on Anglican Orders<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020125091106/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/patriarc.htm |date=2002-01-25 }}</ref> The succession of Anglican bishops is not universally recognized, however. The Roman Catholic Church judged Anglican orders invalid when [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1896 wrote in ''[[Apostolicae curae]]'' that Anglican orders lack validity because the rite by which priests were ordained was not correctly worded from 1547 to 1553 and from 1559 to the time of Archbishop [[William Laud]], (Archbishop of Canterbury 1633\u20131645). The Papacy claimed the form and matter was inadequate to make a Catholic bishop. The actual 'mechanical' succession, prayer and laying on hands was not disputed. Two of the four consecrators of [[Matthew Parker]] in 1559 had been consecrated using the English Ordinal and two using the Roman Pontifical.  Nonetheless, they believed that this caused a break of continuity in apostolic succession, making all further ordinations null and void.\n\n[[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] bishops have, on occasion, granted \"economy\" when Anglican priests convert to Orthodoxy. Various Orthodox churches have also declared Anglican orders valid subject to a finding that the bishops in question did indeed maintain the true faith, the Orthodox concept of Apostolic Succession being one in which the faith must be properly adhered to and transmitted, not simply that the ceremony by which a man is made a bishop is conducted correctly.\n\nChanges in the Anglican Ordinal since King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], and a fuller appreciation of the pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] ordinals, suggest that the correctness of the enduring dismissal of Anglican orders is questionable. To reduce doubt concerning Anglican apostolic succession, especially since the 1930 [[Bonn Agreement (religion)|Bonn agreement]] between the Anglican and Old Catholic churches, some Anglican bishops have included among their consecrators bishops of the [[Old Catholic]] Church, whose holy orders are recognised as valid and regular by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nNeither Roman Catholics nor Anglicans recognize the validity of ordinations of ministers in Protestant churches that do not maintain Apostolic Succession; but some Anglicans, especially Low Church or Evangelical Anglicans, commonly treat Protestant ministers and their sacraments as valid. Rome also does not recognize the apostolic succession of those Lutheran bodies which retained Apostolic Succession.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nOfficially, the [[Anglican Communion]] accepts the ordinations of those denominations which are in full communion with their own churches, such as the [[Lutheran]] state churches of Scandinavia. Those clergy may preside at services requiring a priest if one is not otherwise available.\n\n===Marriage and holy orders===\n{{see also|Clerical celibacy|Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)}}\nThe rules discussed in this section are not considered to be among the infallible dogmas of the Catholic Church, but are mutable rules of discipline. See [[clerical celibacy]] for a more detailed discussion.\n\nMarried men may be ordained to the diaconate as Permanent Deacons, but in the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] generally may not be ordained to the priesthood. In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], married deacons may be ordained priests but may not become bishops.  Bishops in the Eastern Rites and the Eastern Orthodox churches are almost always drawn from among [[Monasticism|monks]], who have taken a vow of celibacy.  They may be widowers, though; it is not required of them never to have been married.\n\nIn some cases, widowed permanent deacons have been ordained to the priesthood.  There have been some situations in which men previously married and ordained to the priesthood in an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church or in a [[Lutheran]] church have been ordained to the Catholic priesthood and allowed to function much as an Eastern Rite priest but in a Latin Rite setting.  This is never ''[[sub conditione]]'' (conditionally), as there is in Catholic canon law no true priesthood in Protestant denominations.  Such ordination may only happen with the approval of the priest's Bishop and a special permission by the Pope.\n\nAnglican clergy may be married or may marry after ordination. In the [[Old Catholic Church]] and the [[Independent Catholic Churches]] there are no ordination restrictions related to marriage.\n\n== Other concepts of ordination ==\nOrdination ritual and procedures vary by denomination. Different churches and denominations specify more or less rigorous requirements for entering into office, and the process of ordination is likewise given more or less ceremonial pomp depending on the group. Many Protestants still communicate authority and ordain to office by having the existing overseers physically lay hands on the candidates for office.\n\n=== Methodist churches ===\nThe American [[Methodist]] model is an episcopal system loosely based on the Anglican model, as the Methodist Church arose from the Anglican Church.  It was first devised under the leadership of Bishops [[Thomas Coke (Methodist)|Thomas Coke]] and [[Francis Asbury]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in the late 18th century. In this approach, an [[Elder (religious)|elder]] (or \"presbyter\") is ordained to word (preaching and teaching), sacrament (administering Baptism and the Lord's Supper), order (administering the life of the church and, in the case of bishops, ordaining others for mission and ministry), and service.  A [[deacon]] is a person ordained only to word and service.\n\nIn the [[United Methodist Church]], for instance, seminary graduates are examined and approved by the Conference Board of Ordained Ministry and then the Clergy Session.  They are accepted as \"probationary (provisional) members of the conference.\"  The resident bishop may commission them to full-time ministry as \"provisional\" ministers.  (Before 1996, the graduate was ordained as a transitional deacon at this point, a provisional role since eliminated.  The order of deacon is now a separate and distinct clergy order in the United Methodist Church.) After serving the probationary period, of a minimum of two years, the probationer is then examined again and either continued on probation, discontinued altogether, or approved for ordination. Upon final approval by the Clergy Session of the Conference, the probationer becomes a full member of the Conference and is then ordained as an elder or deacon by the resident Bishop.  Those ordained as elders are members of the Order of Elders, and those ordained deacons are members of the Order of Deacons.\n\nThe British Methodist Conference has two distinct orders of presbyter and deacon.  It does not have bishops as a separate order of ministry.\n\nJohn Wesley appointed Thomas Coke (above mentioned as bishop) as 'Superintendent', his translation of the Greek 'episcopos' \u2013 which is normally translated 'bishop' in English.  The British Methodist Church has more than 500 Superintendents who are not a separate order of ministry but a role within the order of Presbyters.\n\nIn British Methodism the roles normally undertaken by bishops are expressed in ordaining presbyters and deacons by the annual Conference through its President (or a past president); in confirmation by all presbyters; in local oversight by Superintendents and in regional oversight by Chairs of District.\n\n=== Presbyterian churches ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Presbyterian polity]] -->\n[[Presbyterian]] churches, following their [[Scotland|Scottish]] forebears, reject the traditions surrounding overseers and instead identify the offices of bishop (''episkopos'' in Greek) and elder (''presbuteros'' in Greek, from which the term \"presbyterian\" comes).  The two terms seem to be used interchangeably in the [[Bible]] (compare [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+1.5-9 Titus 1.5\u20139] and [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Tim+3.2-7 I Tim. 3.2\u20137]). Their form of [[Ecclesiastical polity|church governance]] is known as [[presbyterian polity]].  While there is increasing authority with each level of gathering of elders ('Session' over a congregation or parish, then presbytery, then possibly a synod, then the General Assembly), there is no hierarchy of elders.  Each elder has an equal vote at the court on which they stand.\n\nElders are usually chosen at their local level, either elected by the congregation and approved by the Session, or appointed directly by the Session. Some churches place limits on the term that the elders serve, while others ordain elders for life.\n\nPresbyterians also ordain (by laying on of hands) ministers of Word and Sacrament (sometimes known as 'teaching elders'). These ministers are regarded simply as Presbyters ordained to a different function, but in practice they provide the leadership for local Session.\n\nSome Presbyterians identify those appointed (by the laying on of hands) to serve in practical ways ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+6.1-7 Acts 6.1\u20137]) as deacons (''diakonos'' in Greek, meaning \"servant\"). In many congregations, a group of men or women is thus set aside to deal with matters such as congregational fabric and finance, releasing elders for more 'spiritual' work. These persons may be known as 'deacons', 'board members' or 'managers', depending on the local tradition.  Unlike elders and minister, they are not usually 'ordained', and are often elected by the congregation for a set period of time.\n\nOther Presbyterians have used an 'order of deacons' as full-time servants of the wider Church.  Unlike ministers, they do not administer sacraments or routinely preach. The [[Church of Scotland]] has recently begun ordaining deacons to this role.\n\nUnlike the Episcopalian system, but similar to the United Methodist system described above, the two Presbyterian offices are different in ''kind'' rather than in ''degree'', since one need not be a deacon before becoming an elder. Since there is no hierarchy, the two offices do not make up an \"order\" in the technical sense, but the terminology of holy orders is sometimes still developed.\n\n=== Congregationalist churches ===\n[[Congregationalist church governance|Congregationalist]] churches implement different schemes, but the officers usually have less authority than in the presbyterian or episcopalian forms. Some ordain only ministers and rotate members on an advisory board (sometimes called a board of elders or a board of deacons). Because the positions are by comparison less powerful, there is usually less rigor or fanfare in how officers are ordained.\n\n===Latter Day Saint Movement===\n\n==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====\n{{Main article|Priesthood (LDS)}}\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) accepts the legal authority of clergy to perform marriages but does not recognize any other sacraments performed by ministers not ordained to the Latter-day Saint priesthood. Although the Latter-day Saints do claim a doctrine of a certain spiritual \"apostolic succession,\" it is significantly different from that claimed by Catholics and Protestants since there is no succession or continuity between the first century and the lifetime of Joseph Smith, the founder of the LDS church. Mormons teach that the priesthood was lost in ancient times not to be restored by Christ until the nineteenth century when it was given to Joseph Smith directly.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a relatively open priesthood, ordaining nearly all worthy adult males and boys of the age of twelve and older. Latter-day Saint priesthood consists of two divisions: the Melchizedek Priesthood and Aaronic Priesthood. The Melchizedek Priesthood because Melchizedek was such a great high priest. Before his day it was called the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God. But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too frequent repetition of his name, the church, in ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek. The lesser priesthood is an appendage to the Melchizedek Priesthood. It is called the Aaronic Priesthood because it was conferred on Aaron and his sons throughout all their generations.<ref name=\"GospePrinciples\">{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-14-priesthood-organization?lang=eng |title=Gospel Principles Chapter 14: Priesthood Organization |publisher=Lds.org |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>\nThe offices, or ranks, of the Melchizedek order (in roughly descending order) include apostle, seventy, patriarch, high priest, and elder. The offices of the Aaronic order are bishop, priest, teacher, and deacon. The manner of ordination consists of the laying on of hands by two or more men holding at least the office being conferred while one acts as voice in conferring the priesthood or office and usually pronounces a blessing upon the recipient. Teachers and deacons do not have the authority to ordain others to the priesthood. All church members are authorized to teach and preach regardless of priesthood ordination so long as they maintain good standing within the church. The church does not use the term \"holy orders.\"\n\n====Community of Christ====\n{{Main article|Priesthood (Community of Christ)}}\nCommunity of Christ has a largely volunteer priesthood, and all members of the priesthood are free to marry (as traditionally defined by the Christian community).  The priesthood is divided into two orders, the Aaronic priesthood and the Melchisedec priesthood.  The Aaronic order consists of the offices of deacon, teacher and priest.  The Melchisedec Order consists of the offices of elder (including the specialized office of seventy) and high priest (including the specialized offices of evangelist, bishop, apostle, & prophet).  Paid ministers include \u201cappointees\u201d and the general officers of the church, which include some specialized priesthood offices (such as the office of president, reserved for the three top members of the church leadership team).  As of 1984, women have been eligible for priesthood, which is conferred through the sacrament of ordination by the laying-on-of-hands.  While there is technically no age requirement for any office of priesthood, there is no automatic ordination or progression as in the LDS Church.  Young people are occasionally ordained as deacon, and sometimes teacher or priest, but generally most priesthood members are called following completion of post secondary school education. In March 2007 a woman was ordained for the first time to the office of president.\n\n== Ordination of women ==\n{{Main article|Ordination of women}}\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]], in accordance with its understanding of the theological tradition on the issue, and the definitive clarification found in the encyclical letter ''[[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis]]'' (1994) written by [[Pope John Paul II]], officially teaches that it has no authority to [[ordain]] women as priests and thus there is no possibility of women becoming priests at any time in the future. \"Ordaining\" women as deaconesses is not a possibility in any sacramental sense of the diaconate, for a deaconess is not simply a woman who is a deacon but instead holds a position of lay service. As such, she does not receive the sacrament of holy orders.  Many Anglican and Protestant churches ordain women, but in many cases, only to the office of deacon.\n\nVarious branches of the Orthodox churches, including the Greek Orthodox, currently set aside women as deaconesses. Some churches are internally divided on whether the Scriptures permit the ordination of women. When one considers the relative size of the churches (1.1 billion Roman Catholics, 300 million Orthodox, 590 million Anglicans and Protestants), it is a minority of Christian churches that ordain women. Protestants constitute about 27 percent of Christians worldwide, and most of their churches that do ordain women have only done so within the past century.\n\nIn some traditions women may be ordained to the same orders as men.  In others women are restricted from certain offices.  Women may be ordained bishop in the Old Catholic churches and in the Anglican/Episcopal churches in Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Cuba, Brazil, South Africa, Canada, US, Australia, Aotearoa New Zealand and Polynesia. The Church of Ireland had installed [[Pat Storey]] in 2013.

[[Continuing Anglican]] churches of the world do not permit women to be ordained.  In some Protestant denominations, women may serve as assistant pastors but not as pastors in charge of congregations.  In some denominations, women can be ordained to be an [[Elder (religious)|elder]] or [[deacon]].  Some denominations allow for the ordination of women for certain religious orders.  Within certain traditions, such as the Anglican and Lutheran, there is a diversity of theology and practice regarding ordination of women.\n\n== Ordination of LGBT clergy ==\n{{Main article|Ordination of LGBT Christian clergy|Homosexuality and Christianity}}\n\nThe ordination of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]] clergy who are sexually active, and open about it, represents a fiercely contested subject within many [[mainline Protestant]] communities. The majority of churches are opposed to such ordinations because they view [[homosexuality]] as incompatible with Biblical teaching and traditional Christian practice. Yet there are an increasing number of Christian congregations and communities that are open to ordaining people who are gay or lesbian. These are [[liberal Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s, such as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] the [[United Church of Christ]], and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], plus the small [[Metropolitan Community Church]], founded as a church intending to minister primarily to LGBT people, and the [[Church of Sweden]] where such clergy may serve in senior clerical positions.\n\nThe issue of ordination has caused particular controversy in the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], following the approval of [[Gene Robinson]] to be [[Bishop of New Hampshire]] in the [[US Episcopal Church]].\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Print resources ==\n* Campbell, Dennis.

Today scholars use medieval manuscripts, [[papyri]] and other sources; some argue for a 'multi-text' view, rather than seeking a single definitive text.

In 1928, WRNY gave some of the first [[television]] broadcasts. During the show, audio stopped and each artist waved or bowed onscreen. When audio resumed, they performed. Gernsback is also considered a pioneer in [[amateur radio]].\n\nBefore helping to create science fiction, Gernsback was an entrepreneur in the electronics industry, importing radio parts from Europe to the United States and helping to popularize amateur \"wireless\". In April 1908 he founded ''[[Modern Electrics]]'', the world's first magazine about both electronics and radio, called \"wireless\" at the time. While the cover of the magazine itself states it was a catalog, most historians note that it contained articles, features, and plotlines, qualifying it as a magazine.<ref>Massie, K., & Perry, S. D.

In 1912, Gernsback said that he estimated 400,000 people in the U.S. were involved in amateur radio. In 1913, he founded a similar magazine, ''[[The Electrical Experimenter]]'', which became ''Science and Invention'' in 1920.

He originated the industry of specialized publications for radio with ''Modern Electrics'' and ''Electrical Experimenter''. Later on, and more influentially, he published ''[[Radio News]]'', which would have the largest readership among radio magazines in radio broadcasting's formative years. He edited ''Radio News'' until 1929. For a short time he hired [[John F. Rider]] to be editor. Rider was a former engineer working with the [[US Army Signal Corps]] and a radio engineer for A. H. Grebe, a radio manufacturer. However Rider would soon leave Gernsback and form his own publishing company, [[John F. Rider|John F. Rider Publisher]], New York around 1931.\n\nGernsback made use of the magazine to promote his own interests, including having his radio station's call letters on the cover starting in 1925. [[WRNY (defunct)|WRNY]] and ''Radio News'' were used to cross-promote each other, with programs on his station often used to discuss articles he had published, and articles in the magazine often covering program activities at WRNY. He also advocated for future directions in innovation and regulation of radio. The magazine contained many drawings and diagrams, encouraging radio listeners of the 1920s to experiment themselves to improve the technology. WRNY was often used as a laboratory to see if various radio inventions were worthwhile.\n\nArticles that were published about television were also tested in this manner when the radio station was used to send pictures to experimental television receivers in August 1928. The technology, however, required sending sight and sound one after the other rather than sending both at the same time, as WRNY only broadcast on one channel.

From left to right:  ENIAC board, EDVAC board, ORDVAC board, and BRLESC-I board, showing the trend toward miniaturization.]]\nThe '''history of computing hardware''' covers the developments from early simple devices to aid calculation to modern day computers. Before the 20th century, most calculations were done by humans. Early mechanical tools to help humans with digital calculations, such as the [[abacus]], were called \"calculating machines\", called by proprietary names, or referred to as [[calculator]]s. The machine operator was called the computer.\n\nThe first aids to computation were purely mechanical devices which required the operator to set up the initial values of an elementary arithmetic operation, then manipulate the device to obtain the result. Later, computers represented numbers in a continuous form, for instance distance along a scale, rotation of a shaft, or a voltage. Numbers could also be represented in the form of digits, automatically manipulated by a mechanical mechanism. Although this approach generally required more complex mechanisms, it greatly increased the precision of results. A series of breakthroughs, such as miniaturized [[#Transistor computers|transistor computers]], and [[#The integrated circuit|the integrated circuit]], caused digital computers to largely replace [[analog computer]]s. The cost of computers gradually became so low that by the 1990s, [[personal computer]]s, and then, in the 2000s, mobile computers, ([[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablet]]s) became ubiquitous.\n\n==Early devices==\n{{See also|Timeline of computing hardware before 1950}}\n\n===Ancient and medieval===\n[[File:Os d'Ishango IRSNB.JPG|thumb|100px|The [[Ishango bone]] is thought to be a Paleolithic tally stick.<ref>The [[Ishango bone]] is a [[bone tool]], dated to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era, about 18,000 to 20,000&nbsp;BC.

The earliest counting device was probably a form of [[tally stick]]. Later record keeping aids throughout the [[Fertile Crescent]] included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.<ref>According to {{harvnb|Schmandt-Besserat|1981}}, these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a [[bill of lading]] or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers, first, clay impressions of the tokens were placed on the outside of the containers, for the count; the shapes of the impressions were abstracted into stylized marks; finally, the abstract marks were systematically used as numerals; these numerals were finally formalized as numbers. Eventually ([http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html Schmandt-Besserat estimates it took 4000 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130084757/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html |date=2012-01-30 }}) the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count.</ref><ref>{{Citation|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|author-link=Eleanor Robson|year=2008|title=Mathematics in Ancient Iraq|publisher=|isbn=978-0-691-09182-2}}. p.5: calculi were in use in Iraq for primitive accounting systems as early as 3200\u20133000 BCE, with commodity-specific counting representation systems.

(1993) \"The origins of script\" ''Science'' '''260''', 1670\u20131671]</ref> The use of [[counting rods]] is one example. The [[abacus]] was early used for arithmetic tasks. What we now call the [[Roman abacus]] was used in [[Babylonia]] as early as c. 2700\u20132300 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European [[counting house]], a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.\n\nSeveral [[analog computer]]s were constructed in ancient and medieval times to perform astronomical calculations. These included the [[south-pointing chariot]] (c. 1050\u2013771 BC) from [[ancient China]], and the [[astrolabe]] and [[Antikythera mechanism]] from the [[Hellenistic world]] (c. 150\u2013100 BC).<ref>{{harvnb|Lazos|1994}}</ref> In [[Roman Egypt]], [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. 10\u201370 AD) made mechanical devices including automata and a programmable cart.<ref>{{citation |title=A programmable robot from 60 AD |author=Noel Sharkey|publisher=New Scientist|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blog/technology/2007/07/programmable-robot-from-60ad.html|date= July 4, 2007 |volume=2611}}</ref>  Other early mechanical devices used to perform one or another type of calculations include the [[planisphere]] and other mechanical computing devices invented by [[Abu Rayhan al-Biruni]] (c.

This idea was taken up by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] centuries later, and is thus one of the founding elements in computing and [[information science]].\n\n===Renaissance calculating tools===\n[[File:Napier's calculating tables.JPG|thumb|upright|A set of [[John Napier]]'s calculating tables from around 1680]]\nScottish mathematician and physicist [[John Napier]] discovered that the multiplication and division of numbers could be performed by the addition and subtraction, respectively, of the [[logarithm]]s of those numbers. While producing the first logarithmic tables, Napier needed to perform many tedious multiplications. It was at this point that he designed his '[[Napier's bones]]', an abacus-like device that greatly simplified calculations that involved multiplication and division.<ref>A Spanish implementation of [[Napier's bones]] (1617), is documented in {{harvnb|Montaner|Simon|1887|pp=19\u201320}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Sliderule 2005.png|thumb|left|A slide rule]]\nSince [[real number]]s can be represented as distances or intervals on a line, the [[slide rule]] was invented in the 1620s, shortly after Napier's work, to allow multiplication and division operations to be carried out significantly faster than was previously possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Kells|Kern|Bland|1943|p=92}}</ref> [[Edmund Gunter]] built a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale at the [[University of Oxford]]. His device greatly simplified arithmetic calculations, including multiplication and division. [[William Oughtred]] greatly improved this in 1630 with his circular slide rule. He followed this up with the modern slide rule in 1632, essentially a combination of two [[Gunter's scale|Gunter rule]]s, held together with the hands. Slide rules were used by generations of engineers and other mathematically involved professional workers, until the invention of the [[pocket calculator]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kells|Kern|Bland|1943|p=82}}</ref>\n\n===Mechanical calculators===\n[[Wilhelm Schickard]], a German [[polymath]], designed a calculating machine in 1623 which combined a mechanised form of Napier's rods with the world's first mechanical adding machine built into the base. Because it made use of a single-tooth gear there were circumstances in which its carry mechanism would jam.<ref>\"...the single-tooth gear, like that used by Schickard, would not do for a general carry mechanism.  The single-tooth gear works fine if the carry is only going to be propagated a few places but, if the carry has to be propagated several places along the accumulator, the force needed to operate the machine would be of such magnitude that it would do damage to the delicate gear works.\" {{harvnb|Williams|1997|p=128}}</ref> A fire destroyed at least one of the machines in 1624 and it is believed Schickard was too disheartened to build another.\n[[File:Pascaline calculator.jpg|thumb|View through the back of [[Pascal's calculator]]. [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] invented his machine in 1642.]]\nIn 1642, while still a teenager, [[Blaise Pascal]] started some pioneering work on calculating machines and after three years of effort and 50 prototypes<ref>[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/La_Machine_d%E2%80%99arithm%C3%A9tique (fr) La Machine d\u2019arithm\u00e9tique, Blaise Pascal], Wikisource</ref> he invented a [[mechanical calculator]].<ref>{{harvnb|Marguin|1994|p=48}}</ref><ref>[[#DOCA|Maurice d'Ocagne (1893)]], p. 245 [http://cnum.cnam.fr/CGI/fpage.cgi?8KU54-2.5/248/150/369/363/369 Copy of this book found on the CNAM site]</ref> He built twenty of these machines (called [[Pascal's calculator]] or Pascaline) in the following ten years.<ref>{{harvnb|Mourlevat|1988|p=12}}</ref> Nine Pascalines have survived, most of which are on display in European museums.<ref>All nine machines are described in {{harvnb|Vidal|Vogt|2011}}.</ref>  A continuing debate exists over whether Schickard or Pascal should be regarded as the \"inventor of the mechanical calculator\" and the range of issues to be considered is discussed elsewhere.<ref>See in particular, [http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.SchicardvsPascal http://things-that-count.net]</ref>\n\n[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]] invented the [[stepped reckoner]] and his [[Leibniz wheel|famous stepped drum mechanism]] around 1672. He attempted to create a machine that could be used not only for addition and subtraction but would utilise a moveable carriage to enable long multiplication and division. Leibniz once said \"It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used.\"<ref>As quoted in {{harvnb|Smith|1929|pp=180\u2013181}}</ref> However, Leibniz did not incorporate a fully successful carry mechanism.   Leibniz also described the [[binary numeral system]],<ref>{{harvnb|Leibniz|1703}}</ref> a central ingredient of all modern computers. However, up to the 1940s, many subsequent designs (including [[Charles Babbage]]'s machines of the 1822 and even [[ENIAC]] of 1945) were based on the decimal system.<ref>[[Binary-coded decimal]] (BCD) is a numeric representation, or [[character encoding]], which is still widely used.</ref>\n\nAround 1820, [[Charles Xavier Thomas|Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar]] created what would over the rest of the century become the first successful, mass-produced mechanical calculator, the Thomas [[Arithmometer]]. It could be used to add and subtract, and with a moveable carriage the operator could also multiply, and divide by a process of long multiplication and long division.<ref>[http://www.cis.cornell.edu/boom/2005/ProjectArchive/arithometer/ Discovering the Arithmometer], [[Cornell University]]</ref> It utilised a stepped drum similar in conception to that invented by Leibniz. Mechanical calculators remained in use until the 1970s.\n\n===Punched card data processing===\nIn 1804, [[Joseph Marie Jacquard|Joseph-Marie Jacquard]] developed [[Jacquard loom|a loom]] in which the pattern being woven was controlled by a paper tape constructed from [[punched cards]]. The paper tape could be changed without changing the mechanical design of the loom. This was a landmark achievement in programmability. His machine was an improvement over similar weaving looms. Punched cards were preceded by punch bands, as in the machine proposed by [[Basile Bouchon]]. These bands would inspire information recording for automatic pianos and more recently [[numerical control]] machine tools.\n\n[[File:Early SSA accounting operations.jpg|thumb|left|[[IBM]] punched card Accounting Machines, pictured in 1936]]\nIn the late 1880s, the American [[Herman Hollerith]] invented data storage on [[punched card]]s that could then be read by a machine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/hollerith.html |title=Columbia University Computing History \u2014 Herman Hollerith |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> To process these punched cards he invented the [[tabulating machine|tabulator]], and the [[keypunch]] machine.

After working on his revolutionary [[difference engine]], designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an [[Analytical Engine]], was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via [[punched card]]s, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical [[loom]]s such as the [[Jacquard loom]]. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. It employed ordinary [[base-10]] fixed-point arithmetic.\n\nThe Engine incorporated an [[arithmetic logic unit]], [[control flow]] in the form of [[conditional branching]] and [[program loop#Loops|loops]], and integrated [[computer memory|memory]], making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as [[Turing-complete]].<ref name=\"babbageonline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/babbage.aspx?page=5|title=Babbage|work=Online stuff|publisher=Science Museum|date=2007-01-19 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827915.500-lets-build-babbages-ultimate-mechanical-computer.html|title=Let's build Babbage's ultimate mechanical computer|work=opinion|publisher=New Scientist|date= 23 December 2010|accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>\n\nThere was to be a store, or memory, capable of holding 1,000 numbers of 40 decimal digits each (ca. 16.7 [[Kilobyte|kB]]).

Loops and conditional branching were possible, and so the language as conceived would have been [[Turing-complete]] as later defined by [[Alan Turing]]. Three different types of punch cards were used: one for arithmetical operations, one for numerical constants, and one for load and store operations, transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back. There were three separate readers for the three types of cards.\n\nThe machine was about a century ahead of its time. However, the project was slowed by various problems including disputes with the chief machinist building parts for it. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand\u2014this was a major problem for a machine with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing, but also to his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. [[Ada Lovelace]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]]'s daughter, translated and [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|added notes]] to the \"''Sketch of the Analytical Engine''\" by [[Luigi Federico Menabrea]].

When gunnery ranges increased dramatically in the late 19th century it was no longer a simple matter of calculating the proper aim point, given the flight times of the shells. Various spotters on board the ship would relay distance measures and observations to a central plotting station. There the fire direction teams fed in the location, speed and direction of the ship and its target, as well as various adjustments for [[Coriolis effect]], weather effects on the air, and other adjustments; the computer would then output a firing solution, which would be fed to the turrets for laying.

Turing reformulated [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing G\u00f6del's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as [[Turing machine]]s. He proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]]. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is [[Decision problem|undecidable]]: in general, it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given Turing machine will ever halt.\n\nHe also introduced the notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a [[Universal Turing machine]]), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine, or in other words, it is provably capable of computing anything that is computable by executing a program stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.<ref>\"von Neumann&nbsp;... firmly emphasized to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing\u2014insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others.\" Letter by [[Stanley Frankel]] to [[Brian Randell]], 1972, quoted in [[Jack Copeland]] (2004) ''The Essential Turing'', p22.</ref> Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in [[theory of computation]].

Most digital computers built in this period were electromechanical \u2013 electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation.

It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of [[boolean logic]]al operations on its data, but it was not [[Turing-complete]]. Nine Mk II Colossi were built (The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total). Colossus Mark I contained 1500 thermionic valves (tubes), but Mark II with 2400 valves, was both 5 times faster and simpler to operate than Mark 1, greatly speeding the decoding process.  Mark 2 was designed while Mark 1 was being constructed.

Sometimes, two or more Colossus computers tried different possibilities simultaneously in what now is called [[parallel computing]], speeding the decoding process by perhaps as much as double the rate of comparison.\n\nColossus included the first ever use of [[shift register]]s and [[systolic array]]s, enabling five simultaneous tests, each involving up to 100 [[Boolean algebra|Boolean calculations]], on each of the five channels on the punched tape (although in normal operation only one or two channels were examined in any run). Initially Colossus was only used to determine the initial wheel positions used for a particular message (termed wheel setting).  The Mark 2 included mechanisms intended to help determine pin patterns (wheel breaking). Both models were programmable using switches and plug panels in a way their predecessors had not been.\n\n[[File:Eniac.jpg|thumb|[[ENIAC]] was the first Turing-complete electronic device, and performed ballistics trajectory calculations for the [[United States Army]].<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2014/11/eniac-unearthed/ Brendan I.

Details of their existence, design, and use were kept secret well into the 1970s. [[Winston Churchill]] personally issued an order for their destruction into pieces no larger than a man's hand, to keep secret that the British were capable of cracking [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ cyphers]] (from German rotor stream cipher machines) during the oncoming Cold War. Two of the machines were transferred to the newly formed [[GCHQ]] and the others were destroyed. As a result, the machines were not included in many histories of computing.<ref>The existence of Colossus was not known to American computer scientists, such as [[Gordon Bell]] and [[Allen Newell]] (1971) in their ''Computing Structures'', a standard reference work in the 1970s</ref> A reconstructed working copy of one of the Colossus machines is now on display at Bletchley Park.\n\nThe US-built [[ENIAC]] (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first electronic programmable computer built in the US. Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus it was much faster and more flexible. It was unambiguously a Turing-complete device and could compute any problem that would fit into its memory. Like the Colossus, a \"program\" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the [[stored program]] electronic machines that came later. Once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches. The programmers of the ENIAC were women who had been trained as mathematicians.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=39}}\n\nIt combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root. High-speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes). Built under the direction of [[John Mauchly]] and [[J. Presper Eckert]] at the University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.<ref name=\"Eniac\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techiwarehouse.com/engine/a046ee08/Generations-of-Computer|title=Generations of Computer|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref> One of its major engineering feats was to minimize the effects of tube burnout, which was a common problem in machine reliability at that time. The machine was in almost constant use for the next ten years.\n\n==Stored-program computer==\n{{Main|Stored-program computer}}\n{{Further|List of vacuum tube computers}}\n\nEarly computing machines had fixed programs. For example, a desk [[calculator]] is a fixed program computer.  It can do basic [[mathematics]], but it cannot be used as a [[word processor]] or a gaming console.  Changing the program of a fixed-program machine requires re-wiring, re-structuring, or re-designing the machine.  The earliest computers were not so much \"programmed\" as they were \"designed\".  \"Reprogramming\", when it was possible at all, was a laborious process, starting with [[flowchart]]s and paper notes, followed by detailed engineering designs, and then the often-arduous process of physically re-wiring and re-building the machine.<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=104}}</ref> With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes by design an [[instruction set]] and can store in memory a set of instructions (a [[computer program|program]]) that details the [[computation]].\n\n=== Theory ===\n[[File:von Neumann architecture.svg|thumb|Design of the [[von Neumann architecture]], 1947]]\n\nThe theoretical basis for the stored-program computer had been composed by [[Alan Turing]] in his 1936 paper. In 1945 Turing joined the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] and began his work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer. His 1945 report \u2018Proposed Electronic Calculator\u2019 was the first specification for such a device.\n\nMeanwhile, [[John von Neumann]] at the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], circulated his ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'' in 1945. Although substantially similar to Turing's design and containing comparatively little engineering detail, the computer architecture it outlined became known as the \"[[von Neumann architecture]]\". Turing presented a more detailed paper to the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL) Executive Committee in 1946, giving the first reasonably complete design of a [[stored-program computer]], a device he called the [[Automatic Computing Engine]] (ACE). However, the better-known [[EDVAC]] design of [[John von Neumann]], who knew of Turing's theoretical work, received more publicity, despite its incomplete nature and questionable lack of attribution of the sources of some of the ideas.<ref name=\"stanf\"/>\n\nTuring thought that the speed and the size of [[computer memory]] were crucial elements, so he proposed a high-speed memory of what would today be called 25 [[Kibibyte|KB]], accessed at a speed of 1 [[Hertz|MHz]]. The ACE implemented [[subroutine]] calls, whereas the EDVAC did not, and the ACE also used ''Abbreviated Computer Instructions,'' an early form of [[programming language]].\n\n===Manchester Baby===\n{{Main|Manchester Baby}}\n[[File:SSEM Manchester museum close up.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=Three tall racks containing electronic circuit boards|A section of the rebuilt [[Manchester Baby]], the first electronic stored-program computer]]\nThe [[Manchester Baby]] was the world's first electronic [[stored-program computer]].

Thirty-four patents resulted from the machine's development, and many of the ideas behind its design were incorporated in subsequent commercial products such as the {{nowrap|[[IBM 701]]}} and [[IBM 702|702]] as well as the Ferranti Mark 1. The chief designers, [[Frederic Calland Williams|Frederic C.

Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life.  Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space. Transistors greatly reduced computers' size, initial cost, and [[operating cost]].\nTypically, second-generation computers were composed of large numbers of [[printed circuit board]]s such as the [[IBM Standard Modular System]]<ref name=IBM_SMS>{{harvnb|IBM_SMS|1960}}</ref>\neach carrying one to four [[logic gate]]s or [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]].\n\nAt the [[University of Manchester]], a team under the leadership of [[Tom Kilburn]] designed and built a machine using the newly developed [[transistor]]s instead of valves. Initially the only devices available were [[germanium]] [[point-contact transistor]]s, less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power.{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|pp=34\u201335|ps=}} Their first [[transistor computer|transistorised computer]] and the first in the world, was [[Manchester computers#Transistor Computer|operational by 1953]],<ref name=LavingtonP37>{{Harvnb|Lavington|1998|p=37}}</ref> and a second version was completed there in April 1955.{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|p=37|ps=}} The 1955 version used 200 transistors, 1,300 [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[diode]]s, and had a power consumption of 150 watts.

IBM installed more than ten thousand 1401s between 1960 and 1964.\n\n===Transistorized peripherals===\nTransistorized electronics improved not only the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] (Central Processing Unit), but also the [[peripheral|peripheral devices]]. The second generation [[disk storage|disk data storage units]] were able to store tens of millions of letters and digits.  Next to the [[fixed disk]] storage units, connected to the CPU via high-speed data transmission, were removable disk data storage units. A removable [[disk pack]] can be easily exchanged with another pack in a few seconds. Even if the removable disks' capacity is smaller than fixed disks, their interchangeability guarantees a nearly unlimited quantity of data close at hand. [[Magnetic tape data storage|Magnetic tape]] provided archival capability for this data, at a lower cost than disk.\n\nMany second-generation CPUs delegated peripheral device communications to a secondary processor. For example, while the communication processor controlled [[Unit record equipment|card reading and punching]], the main CPU executed calculations and binary [[branch (computer science)|branch instructions]]. One [[Bus (computing)|databus]] would bear data between the main CPU and core memory at the CPU's [[fetch-execute cycle]] rate, and other databusses would typically serve the peripheral devices. On the [[PDP-1]], the core memory's cycle time was 5 microseconds; consequently most arithmetic instructions took 10 microseconds (100,000 operations per second) because most operations took at least two memory cycles; one for the instruction, one for the [[operand]] data fetch.\n\nDuring the second generation [[Remote Digital Terminal|remote terminal]] units (often in the form of [[Teleprinter]]s like a [[Friden Flexowriter]]) saw greatly increased use.<ref>[[Allen Newell]] used remote terminals to communicate cross-country with the [[RAND]] computers, as noted in {{harvnb|Simon|1991}}</ref>  Telephone connections provided sufficient speed for early remote terminals and allowed hundreds of kilometers separation between remote-terminals and the computing center. Eventually these stand-alone computer networks would be generalized into an interconnected ''[[history of the Internet|network of networks]]''\u2014the Internet.<ref>[[Robert Taylor (computer scientist)|Bob Taylor]] conceived of a generalized protocol to link together multiple networks to be viewed as a single session regardless of the specific network: \"Wait a minute. Why not just have one terminal, and it connects to anything you want it to be connected to?

This led to the invention of the [[microprocessor]].  While the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term \"microprocessor\", it is largely undisputed that the first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004,<ref>{{harvnb|Intel_4004|1971}}</ref> designed and realized by [[Marcian Hoff|Ted Hoff]], [[Federico Faggin]], and [[Stanley Mazor]] at [[Intel]].<ref>The Intel 4004 (1971) die was 12&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>, composed of 2300 transistors; by comparison, the Pentium Pro was 306&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>, composed of 5.5 million transistors, according to {{harvnb|Patterson|Hennessy|1998|pp=27\u201339}}.</ref>\n\nWhile the earliest microprocessor ICs literally contained only the processor, i.e. the central processing unit, of a computer, their progressive development naturally led to chips containing most or all of the internal electronic parts of a computer. The integrated circuit in the image on the right, for example, an [[Intel]] 8742, is an [[8-bit]] [[microcontroller]] that includes a [[CPU]] running at 12&nbsp;MHz, 128 bytes of [[RAM]], 2048 bytes of [[EPROM]], and [[Input/output|I/O]] in the same chip.\n\nDuring the 1960s there was considerable overlap between second and third generation technologies.<ref>In the defense field, considerable work was done in the computerized implementation of equations such as {{harvnb|Kalman|1960|pp= 35\u201345}}</ref>  IBM implemented its [[IBM Solid Logic Technology]] modules in [[hybrid circuit]]s for the IBM System/360 in 1964. As late as 1975, Sperry Univac continued the manufacture of second-generation machines such as the UNIVAC 494. The [[Burroughs large systems]] such as the B5000 were [[stack machine]]s, which allowed for simpler programming. These [[pushdown automaton]]s were also implemented in minicomputers and microprocessors later, which influenced programming language design. Minicomputers served as low-cost computer centers for industry, business and universities.<ref>{{harvnb|Eckhouse|Morris|1979|pp= 1\u20132}}</ref> It became possible to simulate analog circuits with the ''simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis'', or [[SPICE]] (1971) on minicomputers, one of the programs for electronic design automation ([[:Category:Electronic design automation software|EDA]]).\nThe microprocessor led to the development of the [[microcomputer]], small, low-cost computers that could be owned by individuals and small businesses. Microcomputers, the first of which appeared in the 1970s, became ubiquitous in the 1980s and beyond.\n\nWhile which specific system is considered the first microcomputer is a matter of debate, as there were several unique hobbyist systems developed based on the [[Intel 4004]] and its successor, the [[Intel 8008]], the first commercially available microcomputer kit was the [[Intel 8080]]-based [[Altair 8800]], which was announced in the January 1975 cover article of ''[[Popular Electronics]]''. However, this was an extremely limited system in its initial stages, having only 256 bytes of [[DRAM]] in its initial package and no input-output except its toggle switches and LED register display. Despite this, it was initially surprisingly popular, with several hundred sales in the first year, and demand rapidly outstripped supply. Several early third-party vendors such as [[Cromemco]] and [[Processor Technology]] soon began supplying additional [[S-100 bus]] hardware for the Altair 8800.\n\nIn April 1975 at the [[Hannover Messe|Hannover Fair]], [[Olivetti]] presented the [[Olivetti P6060|P6060]], the world's first complete, pre-assembled personal computer system. The central processing unit consisted of two cards, code named PUCE1 and PUCE2, and unlike most other personal computers was built with [[Transistor\u2013transistor logic|TTL]] components rather than a microprocessor. It had one or two 8\" [[floppy disk]] drives, a 32-character [[plasma display]], 80-column graphical [[thermal printer]], 48 Kbytes of [[RAM]], and [[BASIC]] language. It weighed {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. As a complete system, this was a significant step from the Altair, though it never achieved the same success. It was in competition with a similar product by IBM that had an external floppy disk drive.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1977, most microcomputers, such as the [[KIM-1|MOS Technology KIM-1]], the [[Altair 8800]], and some versions of the [[Apple I]], were sold as kits for do-it-yourselfers. Pre-assembled systems did not gain much ground until 1977, with the introduction of the [[Apple II]], the [[Tandy TRS-80]], the first [[SWTPC]] computers, and the [[Commodore PET]]. Computing has evolved with microcomputer architectures, with features added from their larger brethren, now dominant in most market segments.\n\nA NeXT Computer and its [[object-oriented]] development tools and libraries were used by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] and [[Robert Cailliau]] at [[CERN]] to develop the world's first [[web server]] software, [[CERN httpd]], and also used to write the first [[web browser]], [[WorldWideWeb]]. These facts, along with the close association with Steve Jobs, secure the 68030 NeXT a place in history as one of the most significant computers of all time.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nSystems as complicated as computers require very high [[reliability engineering|reliability]]. ENIAC remained on, in continuous operation from 1947 to 1955, for eight years before being shut down. Although a vacuum tube might fail, it would be replaced without bringing down the system. By the simple strategy of never shutting down ENIAC, the failures were dramatically reduced. The vacuum-tube SAGE air-defense computers became remarkably reliable \u2013 installed in pairs, one off-line, tubes likely to fail did so when the computer was intentionally run at reduced power to find them. [[Hot plugging|Hot-pluggable]] hard disks, like the hot-pluggable vacuum tubes of yesteryear, continue the tradition of repair during continuous operation. Semiconductor memories routinely have no errors when they operate, although operating systems like Unix have employed memory tests on start-up to detect failing hardware. Today, the requirement of reliable performance is made even more stringent when [[server farm]]s are the delivery platform.<ref>\"Since 2005, its [Google's] data centers have been composed of standard shipping containers\u2014each with 1,160 servers and a power consumption that can reach 250 kilowatts.\"&nbsp;\u2014 Ben Jai of Google, as quoted in {{harvnb|Shankland|2009}}</ref> Google has managed this by using fault-tolerant software to recover from hardware failures, and is even working on the concept of replacing entire server farms on-the-fly, during a service event.<ref>\"If you're running 10,000 machines, something is going to die every day.\" \u2014Jeff Dean of Google, as quoted in {{harvnb|Shankland|2008}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/browse_thread/thread/a7640a2743922dcf?pli=1|title=Google Groups|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, [[multi-core]] CPUs became commercially available.<ref>Intel has unveiled a [http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=825 single-chip version of a 48-core CPU] for software and circuit research in cloud computing: accessdate=2009-12-02.

Currently, CAMs (or associative arrays) in software are programming-language-specific. Semiconductor memory cell arrays are very regular structures, and manufacturers prove their processes on them; this allows price reductions on memory products. During the 1980s, CMOS [[logic gates]] developed into devices that could be made as fast as other circuit types; computer power consumption could therefore be decreased dramatically. Unlike the continuous current draw of a gate based on other logic types, a [[CMOS]] gate only draws significant current during the 'transition' between logic states<!--<ref>{{harvnb|Mead |Conway|1980|pp= 0}}</ref>-->, except for leakage.\n\nThis has allowed computing to become a [[commodity]] which is now ubiquitous, embedded in [[embedded system|many forms]], from greeting cards and [[Mobile phone|telephone]]s to [[Satellite communications#History|satellites]]. The [[thermal design power]] which is dissipated during operation has become as essential as computing speed of operation.

Of the many [[separation axiom]]s that can be imposed on a topological space, the \"Hausdorff condition\" (T<sub>2</sub>) is the most frequently used and discussed. It implies the uniqueness of [[Limit of a sequence|limits]] of [[limit of a sequence|sequence]]s, [[net (topology)|net]]s, and [[filter (topology)|filter]]s.\n\nHausdorff spaces are named after [[Felix Hausdorff]], one of the founders of topology.

This condition is the third [[separation axiom]] (after T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub>), which is why Hausdorff spaces are also called ''T<sub>2</sub> spaces''. The name ''separated space'' is also used.\n\nA related, but weaker, notion is that of a '''preregular space'''. ''X'' is a preregular space if any two [[topologically distinguishable]] points can be separated by disjoint neighbourhoods. Preregular spaces are also called ''R<sub>1</sub> spaces''.\n\nThe relationship between these two conditions is as follows. A topological space is Hausdorff [[if and only if]] it is both preregular (i.e. topologically distinguishable points are separated by neighbourhoods) and [[Kolmogorov space|Kolmogorov]] (i.e. distinct points are topologically distinguishable). A topological space is preregular if and only if its [[Kolmogorov quotient]] is Hausdorff.\n\n== Equivalences ==\n\nFor a topological space ''X'', the following are equivalent:\n* ''X'' is a Hausdorff space.\n* Limits of [[net (topology)|nets]] in ''X'' are unique.<ref>Willard, pp. 86&ndash;87.</ref>\n* Limits of [[filter (topology)|filters]] on ''X'' are unique.<ref>Willard, pp. 86&ndash;87.</ref>\n* Any [[singleton set]] {{nowrap|{''x''} &sub; ''X''}} is equal to the intersection of all [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|closed neighbourhoods]] of ''x''.<ref>Bourbaki, p.&nbsp;75.</ref> (A closed neighbourhood of ''x'' is a [[closed set]] that contains an open set containing ''x''.)\n* The diagonal \u0394 = {(''x'',''x'') | ''x'' \u2208 ''X''} is [[closed set|closed]] as a subset of the [[product space]] ''X'' &times; ''X''.\n\n== Examples and non-examples ==\n\nAlmost all spaces encountered in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] are Hausdorff; most importantly, the [[real number]]s (under the standard [[metric topology]] on real numbers) are a Hausdorff space. More generally, all [[metric space]]s are Hausdorff. In fact, many spaces of use in analysis, such as [[topological group]]s and [[topological manifold]]s, have the Hausdorff condition explicitly stated in their definitions.\n\nA simple example of a topology that is [[T1 space|T<sub>1</sub>]] but is not Hausdorff is the [[cofinite topology]] defined on an [[infinite set]].\n\n[[Pseudometric space]]s typically are not Hausdorff, but they are preregular, and their use in analysis is usually only in the construction of Hausdorff [[gauge space]]s. Indeed, when analysts run across a non-Hausdorff space, it is still probably at least preregular, and then they simply replace it with its Kolmogorov quotient, which is Hausdorff.<ref>See for instance [[Lp space#Lp spaces]], [[Banach\u2013Mazur compactum]] etc.</ref>\n\nIn contrast, non-preregular spaces are encountered much more frequently in [[abstract algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]], in particular as the [[Zariski topology]] on an [[algebraic variety]] or the [[spectrum of a ring]]. They also arise in the [[model theory]] of [[intuitionistic logic]]: every [[complete lattice|complete]] [[Heyting algebra]] is the algebra of [[open set]]s of some topological space, but this space need not be preregular, much less Hausdorff, and in fact usually is neither. The related concept of [[Scott domain]] also consists of non-preregular spaces.\n\nWhile the existence of unique limits for convergent nets and filters implies that a space is Hausdorff, there are non-Hausdorff T<sub>1</sub> spaces in which every convergent sequence has a unique limit.<ref>{{cite journal |last=van Douwen |first=Eric K. |title=An anti-Hausdorff Fr\u00e9chet space in which convergent sequences have unique limits |journal=[[Topology and its Applications]] |volume=51 |issue=2 |year=1993 |pages=147\u2013158 |doi=10.1016/0166-8641(93)90147-6 }}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\n\n[[Subspace (topology)|Subspace]]s and [[product topology|products]] of Hausdorff spaces are Hausdorff,<ref>{{planetmath reference|id=7202|title=Hausdorff property is hereditary}}</ref> but [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]]s of Hausdorff spaces need not be Hausdorff. In fact, ''every'' topological space can be realized as the quotient of some Hausdorff space.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Shimrat |first=M. |title=Decomposition spaces and separation properties |journal=Quart. J. Math. |volume=2 |issue= |year=1956 |pages=128\u2013129 |doi= }}</ref>\n\nHausdorff spaces are [[T1 space|T<sub>1</sub>]], meaning that all [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s are closed. Similarly, preregular spaces are [[R0 space|R<sub>0</sub>]].\n\nAnother nice property of Hausdorff spaces is that [[compact set]]s are always closed.<ref>{{planetmath reference|id=4203|title=Proof of A compact set in a Hausdorff space is closed}}</ref> This may fail in non-Hausdorff spaces such as [[Sierpi\u0144ski space]]. \n\nThe definition of a Hausdorff space says that points can be separated by neighborhoods. It turns out that this implies something which is seemingly stronger: in a Hausdorff space every pair of disjoint compact sets can also be separated by neighborhoods,<ref>Willard, p.&nbsp;124.</ref> in other words there is a neighborhood of one set and a neighborhood of the other, such that the two neighborhoods are disjoint. This is an example of the general rule that compact sets often behave like points.\n\nCompactness conditions together with preregularity often imply stronger separation axioms. For example, any [[locally compact space|locally compact]] preregular space is [[completely regular space|completely regular]]. [[Compact space|Compact]] preregular spaces are [[normal space|normal]], meaning that they satisfy [[Urysohn's lemma]] and the [[Tietze extension theorem]] and have [[partition of unity|partitions of unity]] subordinate to locally finite [[open cover]]s. The Hausdorff versions of these statements are: every locally compact Hausdorff space is [[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]], and every compact Hausdorff space is normal Hausdorff.\n\nThe following results are some technical properties regarding maps ([[continuous (topology)|continuous]] and otherwise) to and from Hausdorff spaces.\n\nLet ''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' be a continuous function and suppose ''Y'' is Hausdorff. Then the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of ''f'', <math>\\{(x,f(x)) \\mid x\\in X\\}</math>, is a closed subset of ''X'' &times; ''Y''.\n\nLet ''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' be a function and let <math>\\operatorname{ker}(f) \\triangleq \\{(x,x') \\mid f(x) = f(x')\\}</math> be its [[kernel of a function|kernel]] regarded as a subspace of ''X'' &times; ''X''.\n*If ''f'' is continuous and ''Y'' is Hausdorff then ker(''f'') is closed.\n*If ''f'' is an [[open map|open]] [[surjection]] and ker(''f'') is closed then ''Y'' is Hausdorff.\n*If ''f'' is a continuous, open surjection (i.e. an open quotient map) then ''Y'' is Hausdorff [[if and only if]] ker(f) is closed.\n\nIf ''f,g'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' are continuous maps and ''Y'' is Hausdorff then the [[Equaliser (mathematics)|equalizer]] <math>\\mbox{eq}(f,g) = \\{x \\mid f(x) = g(x)\\}</math> is closed in ''X''. It follows that if ''Y'' is Hausdorff and ''f'' and ''g'' agree on a [[dense (topology)|dense]] subset of ''X'' then ''f'' = ''g''. In other words, continuous functions into Hausdorff spaces are determined by their values on dense subsets.\n\nLet ''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' be a [[closed map|closed]] surjection such that ''f''<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''y'') is [[compact space|compact]] for all ''y'' \u2208 ''Y''. Then if ''X'' is Hausdorff so is ''Y''.\n\nLet ''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' be a [[quotient map]] with ''X'' a compact Hausdorff space. Then the following are equivalent:\n*''Y'' is Hausdorff.\n*''f'' is a [[closed map]].\n*ker(''f'') is closed.\n\n== Preregularity versus regularity ==\n\nAll [[regular space]]s are preregular, as are all Hausdorff spaces. There are many results for topological spaces that hold for both regular and Hausdorff spaces.\nMost of the time, these results hold for all preregular spaces; they were listed for regular and Hausdorff spaces separately because the idea of preregular spaces came later.\nOn the other hand, those results that are truly about regularity generally do not also apply to nonregular Hausdorff spaces.\n\nThere are many situations where another condition of topological spaces (such as [[paracompactness]] or [[local compactness]]) will imply regularity if preregularity is satisfied.\nSuch conditions often come in two versions: a regular version and a Hausdorff version.\nAlthough Hausdorff spaces are not, in general, regular, a Hausdorff space that is also (say) locally compact will be regular, because any Hausdorff space is preregular.\nThus from a certain point of view, it is really preregularity, rather than regularity, that matters in these situations.\nHowever, definitions are usually still phrased in terms of regularity, since this condition is better known than preregularity.\n\nSee [[History of the separation axioms]] for more on this issue.\n\n== Variants ==\n\nThe terms \"Hausdorff\", \"separated\", and \"preregular\" can also be applied to such variants on topological spaces as [[uniform space]]s, [[Cauchy space]]s, and [[convergence space]]s.\nThe characteristic that unites the concept in all of these examples is that limits of nets and filters (when they exist) are unique (for separated spaces) or unique up to topological indistinguishability (for preregular spaces).\n\nAs it turns out, uniform spaces, and more generally Cauchy spaces, are always preregular, so the Hausdorff condition in these cases reduces to the T<sub>0</sub> condition.\nThese are also the spaces in which [[completeness (topology)|completeness]] makes sense, and Hausdorffness is a natural companion to completeness in these cases.\nSpecifically, a space is complete if and only if every Cauchy net has at ''least'' one limit, while a space is Hausdorff if and only if every Cauchy net has at ''most'' one limit (since only Cauchy nets can have limits in the first place).\n\n== Algebra of functions ==\n\nThe algebra of continuous (real or complex) functions on a compact Hausdorff space is a commutative [[C*-algebra]], and conversely by the [[Banach\u2013Stone theorem]] one can recover the topology of the space from the algebraic properties of its algebra of continuous functions. This leads to [[noncommutative geometry]], where one considers noncommutative C*-algebras as representing algebras of functions on a noncommutative space.\n\n== Academic humour ==\n\n* Hausdorff condition is illustrated by the pun that in Hausdorff spaces any two points can be \"housed off\" from each other by [[open sets]].<ref>Colin Adams and Robert Franzosa. ''Introduction to Topology: Pure and Applied.'' p.&nbsp;42</ref>\n* In the Mathematics Institute of the [[Universit\u00e4t Bonn|University of Bonn]], in which [[Felix Hausdorff]] researched and lectured, there is a certain room designated the '''Hausdorff-Raum'''.  This is a pun, as ''Raum'' means both ''room'' and ''space'' in German.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Quasitopological space]]\n*[[Weak Hausdorff space]]\n*[[Fixed-point space]], a Hausdorff space ''X'' such that every continuous function ''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''X'' has a fixed point.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Arkhangelskii, A.V., [[L.S.

Playing free outside the [[Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music|Bath Festival]], they encountered another [[Ladbroke Grove]] based band, the [[Pink Fairies]], who shared similar interests in music and recreational activities; a friendship developed which led to the two bands becoming running partners and performing as \"Pinkwind\". Their use of drugs, however, led to the departure of Harrison, who did not partake, to be replaced briefly by [[Thomas Crimble (musician)|Thomas Crimble]] (about July 1970 \u2013 March 1971).

This album offered a refinement of the band's image and philosophy courtesy of graphic artist [[Barney Bubbles]] and underground press writer [[Robert Calvert]], as depicted in the accompanying ''Hawklog'' booklet, which would be further developed into the ''Space Ritual'' stage show.

One of the early gigs the band played was a benefit for the Greasy Truckers at [[The Roundhouse]] on 13 February 1972. A live album of the concert, ''[[Greasy Truckers Party]]'', was released, and after re-recording the vocal, a single, \"[[Silver Machine]]\", was also released, reaching number three in the UK charts. This generated sufficient funds for the subsequent album ''[[Doremi Fasol Latido]]'' Space Ritual tour. The show featured dancers Stacia and Miss Renee typically performing either topless or wearing only body paint, mime artist Tony Carrera and a light show by [[Liquid Len]] and was recorded on the elaborate package ''[[Space Ritual]]''. At the height of their success, in 1973, the band released the single \"[[Urban Guerrilla]]\", which coincided with an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombing campaign in London, so the [[BBC]] refused to play it and the band's management reluctantly decided to withdraw it fearing accusations of opportunism, despite the disc having already climbed to number 39 in the UK chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawkwindmuseum.co.uk/micro.htm|title=micro articles|website=Hawkwindmuseum.co.uk|accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nDik Mik departed during 1973 and Calvert ended his association with the band to concentrate on solo projects. Dettmar also indicated that he was to leave the band, so [[Simon House]] was recruited as keyboardist and violinist playing live shows, a North America tour and recording the 1974 album ''[[Hall of the Mountain Grill]]''. Dettmar left after a European tour and emigrated to Canada, whilst [[Alan Powell (drummer)|Alan Powell]] deputised for an incapacitated King on that European tour, but remained giving the band two drummers.\n\nAt the beginning of 1975, the band recorded the album ''[[Warrior on the Edge of Time]]'' in collaboration with [[Michael Moorcock]], loosely based on his [[Eternal Champion (character)|Eternal Champion]] figure.

A manic phase saw the band abandon a European tour in France,<ref>NME, 12 November 1977 \u2013 Hawklord in KGB Wedding Affair \u2013 [http://www.kadu.demon.co.uk/pages/bobswedding.html Jon's Attic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003015418/http://www.kadu.demon.co.uk/pages/bobswedding.html |date=3 October 2006 }}</ref> while a depression phase during a 1978 North American tour convinced Brock to disband the group.<ref>This Is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic, Chapter 6 \u2013 Kris Tait</ref> In between these two tours, the band had recorded the album ''[[PXR5]]'' in January 1978, but its release was delayed until 1979.\n\nOn 23 December 1977 in [[Barnstaple]], Brock and Calvert had performed a one-off gig with Devon band Ark as the [[Sonic Assassins]], and looking for a new project in 1978, bassist [[Harvey Bainbridge]] and drummer Martin Griffin were recruited from this event. [[Steve Swindells]] was recruited as keyboard player. The band was named [[Hawklords]], (probably for legal reasons, the band having recently split from their management), and recording took place on a farm in Devon using a mobile studio, resulting in the album ''[[25 Years On]]''. King had originally been the drummer for the project but quit during recording sessions to return to London, while House, who had temporarily left the band to join a [[David Bowie]] tour, elected to remain with Bowie full-time, but nevertheless contributed violin to these sessions. At the end of the band's UK tour, Calvert, wanting King back in the band, dismissed Griffin, then promptly resigned himself, choosing to pursue a career in literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aural-innovations.com/issues/issue18/03_jones.html|title=Working Down A Diamond Mine|website=aural-innovations.com|accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref> Swindells left to record a solo album after an offer had been made to him by the record company [[Atco Records|ATCO]].\n\n===1980s: Bronze, RCA and Flicknife eras===\nIn late 1979, Hawkwind reformed with Brock, Bainbridge and King being joined by [[Huw Lloyd-Langton]] (who had played on the debut album) and [[Tim Blake]] (formerly of [[Gong (band)|Gong]]), embarking upon a UK tour despite not having a record deal or any product to promote. Some shows were recorded and a deal was made with [[Bronze Records]], resulting in the ''[[Live Seventy Nine]]'' album, quickly followed by the studio album ''[[Levitation (album)|Levitation]]''. However, during the recording of ''Levitation'' King quit and [[Ginger Baker]] was drafted in for the sessions, but he chose to stay with the band for the tour, during which Blake left to be replaced by Keith Hale.\n\nIn 1981 Baker and Hale left after their insistence that Bainbridge should be dismissed was ignored,<ref>This Is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic, Chapter 7 \u2013 Kris Tait</ref> and Brock and Bainbridge elected to handle synthesisers and sequencers themselves, with drummer Griffin from the Hawklords rejoining. Three albums, which again saw Moorcock contributing lyrics and vocals, were recorded for [[Active Records|RCA/Active]]: ''[[Sonic Attack (album)|Sonic Attack]]'', the electronic ''[[Church of Hawkwind]]'' and ''[[Choose Your Masques]]''. This band headlined the 1981 [[Glastonbury Festival]] and made an appearance at the 1982 [[Monsters of Rock|Donington Monsters of Rock Festival]], as well as continuing to play the summer [[solstice]] at [[Stonehenge Free Festival]].\n\nIn the early 1980s, Brock had started using drum machines for his home demos and became increasingly frustrated at the inability of drummers to keep perfect time, leading to a succession of drummers coming and going. First, Griffin was ousted and the band tried King again, but, unhappy with his playing at that time, he was rejected. [[Andy Anderson (drummer)|Andy Anderson]] briefly joined while he was also playing for [[The Cure]], and [[Robert Heaton]] also filled the spot briefly prior to the rise of [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]]. [[Lloyd Langton Group]] drummer John Clark did some recording sessions, and in late 1983 Rick Martinez joined the band to play drums on the ''Earth Ritual'' tour in February and March 1984, later replaced by Clive Deamer.\n\nTurner had returned as a guest for the 1982 ''Choose Your Masques'' tour and was invited back permanently. Further tours ensued with Phil \"[[Dead Fred]]\" Reeves augmenting the line-up on keyboards and violin, but neither Turner nor Reeves would appear on the only recording of 1983\u201384, ''[[The Earth Ritual Preview]]'', but there was a guest spot for Lemmy. The ''Earth Ritual'' tour was filmed for Hawkwind's first video release, ''[[Night of the Hawk (Hawkwind video)|Night of the Hawk]]''.\n\n[[Alan Davey (musician)|Alan Davey]] was a young fan of the band who had sent a tape of his playing to Brock,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawkwindmuseum.co.uk/alan3.htm|title=alan daveyhf|website=Hawkwindmuseum.co.uk|accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref> and Brock chose to oust Reeves moving Bainbridge from bass to keyboards to accommodate Davey. This experimental line-up played at the Stonehenge Free Festival in 1984, which was filmed and release as ''[[Stonehenge (Hawkwind video)|Stonehenge 84]]''. Subsequent personal and professional tensions between Brock and Turner led to the latter's expulsion at the beginning of 1985.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5w3xmCgvT?url=http://www.starfarer.net/clippings12.html] </ref> Clive Deamer, who was deemed \"too professional\" for the band,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050105004200/http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/_hwpress/hw19850500muk.html] </ref> was eventually replaced in 1985 by Danny Thompson Jr, a friend of bassist Alan Davey, and remained almost to the end of the decade.\n\nHawkwind's association with Moorcock climaxed in their most ambitious project, ''[[The Chronicle of the Black Sword]]'', based loosely around the [[Elric]] series of books and theatrically staged with Tony Crerar as the central character. Moorcock contributed lyrics, but only performed some spoken pieces on some live dates. The tour was recorded and issued as an album ''[[Live Chronicles]]'' and video ''[[The Chronicle of the Black Sword (Hawkwind video)|The Chronicle of the Black Sword]]''. A headline appearance at the 1986 Reading Festival was followed by a UK tour to promote the ''Live Chronicles'' album which was filmed and released as ''[[Chaos (Hawkwind video)|Chaos]]''. In 1988 the band recorded the album ''[[The Xenon Codex]]'' with Guy Bidmead, but all was not well in the band and soon after, both Lloyd-Langton and Thompson departed.\n\nDrummer Richard Chadwick, who joined in the summer of 1988, had been playing in small alternative free festival bands, most notably Bath's Smart Pils, for a decade and had frequently crossed paths with Hawkwind and Brock. He was initially invited simply to play with the band, but eventually replaced stand in drummer Mick Kirton to become the band's drummer to the present day.\n\nTo fill in the gap of lead sound, lost when Lloyd-Langton left, violinist House was re-instated into the line-up in 1989 (having previously been a member from 1974 until 1978), and, notably, Hawkwind embarked on their first North American visit in eleven years (since the somewhat disastrous 1978 tour), in which House did not partake. The successfully received tour was the first of several over the coming years, in an effort by the band to re-introduce themselves to the American market.\n\n===1990s: GWR, Essential and Emergency Broadcast System===\n[[Bridget Wishart]], an associate of Chadwick's from the festival circuit, also joined to become the band's one and only singing front-woman, the band had been fronted in earlier days by Stacia but only as a dancer. This band produced two albums, 1990's ''[[Space Bandits]]'' and 1991's ''[[Palace Springs (album)|Palace Springs]]'' and also filmed a 1-hour appearance for the ''[[Nottingham (Hawkwind video)|Bedrock TV]]'' series.\n\n1990 saw Hawkwind tour North America again, the second instalment in a series of American visits made at around this time in an effort to re-establish the Hawkwind brand in America. The original business plan was to hold three consecutive US tours, annually, from 1989\u20131991, with the first losing money, the second breaking even, and the third turning a profit, ultimately bringing Hawkwind back into recognition across the Atlantic. Progress, however, was somewhat stunted, due to ex-member Nik Turner touring the United States with his own band at the time, in which the shows were often marketed as Hawkwind.\n\nIn 1991 Bainbridge, House and Wishart departed and the band continued as a three piece relying heavily on synthesisers and sequencers to create a wall-of-sound. The 1992 album ''[[Electric Tepee]]'' combined hard rock and light ambient pieces, while ''[[It is the Business of the Future to be Dangerous]]'' is almost devoid of the rock leanings. ''[[The Business Trip]]'' is a record of the previous album's tour, but rockier as would be expected from a live outing. The ''[[White Zone]]'' album was released under the alias Psychedelic Warriors to distance itself entirely from the rock expectancy of Hawkwind.\n\nA general criticism of techno music at that time was its facelessness and lack of personality, which the band were coming to feel also plagued them.<ref>The Saga of Hawkwind (pp413) \u2013 Carol Clerk</ref> [[Ron Tree]] had known the band on the festival circuit and offered his services as a front-man, and the band duly employed him for the album ''[[Alien 4 (album)|Alien 4]]'' and its accompanying tour which resulted in the album ''[[Love in Space]]'' and ''[[Love in Space (Hawkwind video)|video]]''.\n\nIn 1996, unhappy with the musical direction of the band, bassist Davey left, forming his own Middle-Eastern flavoured hard-rock group Bedouin and a Mot\u00f6rhead tribute act named Ace of Spades.<ref>The Saga of Hawkwind (pp418) \u2013 Carol Clerk</ref> His bass playing role was reluctantly picked up by singer Tree and the band were joined full-time by lead guitarist Jerry Richards (another stalwart of the festival scene, playing for Tubilah Dog who had merged with Brock's Agents of Chaos during 1988) for the albums ''[[Distant Horizons]]'' and ''[[In Your Area]]''. Rasta chanter Captain Rizz also joined the band for guest spots during live shows.\n\n===2000s: Hawkestra, Turner-Brock disputes, Voiceprint and emergence of stable modern line-up===\nHawkestra \u2014 a re-union event featuring appearances from past and present members \u2014 had originally been intended to coincide with the band's 30th anniversary and the release of the career spanning ''[[Epocheclipse|Epocheclipse \u2013 30 Year Anthology]]'' set, but logistical problems delayed it until 21 October 2000. It took place at the [[Brixton Academy]] with about 20 members taking part in a 3+ hour set which was filmed and recorded. Guests included [[Samantha Fox]] who sang \"Master of the Universe\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/suffolk/content/articles/2005/10/25/hawkwind_foster_feature.shtml|title=Hawkwind: The Leader Speaks|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref> However, arguments and disputes over financial recompense and musical input resulted in the prospect of the event being re-staged unlikely, and any album or DVD release being indefinitely shelved.<ref>The Saga of Hawkwind, Chapter 30: The Great Hawkestra Disaster \u2013 Carol Clerk</ref>\n\nThe Hawkestra had set a template for Brock to assemble a core band of Tree, Brock, Richards, Davey, Chadwick and for the use of former members as guests on live shows and studio recordings. The 2000 Christmas Astoria show was recorded with contributions from House, Blake, Rizz, Moorcock, Jez Huggett and Keith Kniveton and released as ''[[Yule Ritual]]'' the following year. In 2001, Davey agreed to rejoin the band permanently, but only after the departure of Tree and Richards.<ref>The Saga of Hawkwind (pp486) \u2013 Carol Clerk</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, having rekindled relationships with old friends at the Hawkestra, Turner organised further Hawkestra gigs resulting in the formation of xhawkwind.com, a band consisting mainly of ex-Hawkwind members and playing old Hawkwind songs. An appearance at Guilfest in 2002 led to confusion as to whether this actually was Hawkwind, sufficiently irking Brock into taking legal action to prohibit Turner from trading under the name Hawkwind. Turner lost the case and the band began performing as [[Space Ritual (band)|Space Ritual]].<ref>The Saga of Hawkwind, Chapter 32: The Hawkwars \u2013 Carol Clerk</ref>\n\nAn appearance at the Canterbury Sound Festival in August 2001, resulting in another live album ''[[Canterbury Fayre 2001]]'', saw guest appearances from Lloyd-Langton, House, Kniveton with [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]] on \"Silver Machine\". The band organised the first of their own weekend festivals, named [[Hawkfest]], in Devon in the summer of 2002. Brown joined the band in 2002 for a Winter tour which featured some [[Kingdom Come (Arthur Brown)|Kingdom Come]] songs and saw appearances from Blake and Lloyd-Langton, the Newcastle show being released on DVD as ''[[Out of the Shadows (Hawkwind video)|Out of the Shadows]]'' and the London show on CD as ''[[Spaced Out in London]]''.\n\nIn 2005 a new album ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (Hawkwind album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]'' was released. Recorded by the core band of Brock/Davey/Chadwick, contributors included new keyboardist [[Jason Stuart (musician)|Jason Stuart]], Arthur Brown, tabloid writer and TV personality [[Matthew Wright (television presenter)|Matthew Wright]], 1970s New Wave singer [[Lene Lovich]], Simon House and Jez Huggett. This was followed in 2006 by the CD/DVD ''[[Take Me to Your Future]]''.\n\nThe band were the subject of an hour-long television documentary entitled ''Hawkwind: Do Not Panic'' that aired on [[BBC Four]] as part of the ''Originals'' series. It was broadcast on 30 March 2007 and repeated on 10 August 2007. Although Brock participated in its making he did not appear in the programme, it is alleged that he requested all footage of himself be removed after he was denied any artistic control over the documentary.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/shows/freakzone/tracklisting_20070204.shtml BBC 6 Music, Freakzone, 4 February 2007] \u2013 Nik Turner interview</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last = Cumming | first = Tim | title = Hawkwind: They're still feeling mean | journal = [[The Independent]] | date = 30 March 2007 | url = http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/music/features/article2403301.ece | postscript = <!--None--> | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/612C11wDE?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/hawkwind-theyre-still-feeling-mean-442403.html | archivedate = 18 August 2011 | df = dmy-all }}\n</ref> In one of the documentary's opening narratives regarding Brock, it is stated that he declined to be interviewed for the programme because of Nik Turner's involvement, indicating that the two men have still not reconciled over the xhawkwind.com incident.\n\nDecember 2006 saw the official departure of Alan Davey, who left to perform and record with two new bands: Gunslinger and Thunor. He was replaced by Mr Dibs, a long-standing member of the road crew. The band performed at their annual Hawkfest festival and headlined the US festival Nearfest and played gigs in PA and NY. At the end of 2007,  [[Tim Blake]] once again joined the band filling the lead role playing keyboards and [[theremin]]. The band played 5 Christmas dates, the London show being released as an audio CD and video DVD under the title ''[[Knights of Space]]''.\n\nIn January 2008 the band reversed its anti-taping policy, long a sore-point with many fans, announcing that it would allow audio recording and non-commercial distribution of such recordings, provided there was no competing official release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hawkwindmuseum.co.uk/trading%20rules.htm |title=trade rules |accessdate=17 January 2008|date=16 January 2008 |publisher=Hawkwind Museum}}</ref> At the end of 2008, Atomhenge Records (a subsidiary of [[Cherry Red Records]]) commenced the re-issuing of Hawkwind's back catalogue from the years 1976 through to 1997 with the release of two triple CD anthologies ''[[Spirit of the Age Anthology|Spirit of the Age (anthology 1976\u201384)]]'' and ''[[Spirit of the Age Anthology|The Dream Goes On (anthology 1985\u201397)]]''.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5w3xxnzAk?url=http://www.cherryred.co.uk/atomhenge/news.htm] </ref>\n\nOn 8 September 2008 keyboard player Jason Stuart died due to a brain haemorrhage. In October 2008, [[Niall Hone]] (former Tribe of Cro) joined Hawkwind for their Winter 2008 tour playing guitar, along with returning synth/theremin player Tim Blake. In this period, Hone also occasionally played bass guitar alongside Mr Dibs and used laptops for live electronic improvisation.\n\nIn 2009, the band began occasionally featuring Jon Sevink, from [[The Levellers (band)|The Levellers]] as guest violinist at some shows. Later that year, Hawkwind embarked on a winter tour to celebrate the band's 40th anniversary, including two gigs on 28 and 29 August marking the anniversary of their first live performances. In 2010, Hawkwind held their annual Hawkfest at the site of the original Isle of Wight Festival, marking the 40th anniversary of their appearance there.\n\n===2010s: Eastworld era and beyond===\nOn 21 June 2010, Hawkwind released a studio album entitled ''[[Blood of the Earth]]'' on Eastworld Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/137843|title=Eastworld Recordings Sign HAWKWIND; Blood of the Earth Details Revealed, E-Card Available|website=Bravewords.com|accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref> During and since the ''Blood of the Earth'' support tours, Hone's primary on-stage responsibility shifted to bass, while Mr. Dibs moved to a more traditional lead singer/front man role.\n\nIn 2011, Hawkwind toured Australia for the second time.\n\nApril 2012 saw the release of a new album, ''[[Onward (album)|Onward]]'', again on Eastworld. Keyboardist [[Dead Fred]] rejoined Hawkwind for the 2012 tour in support of ''Onward'' and has since remained with the band. In November 2012, Brock, Chadwick and Hone \u2014 credited as \"Hawkwind Light Orchestra\" \u2014 released ''Stellar Variations'' on [[Esoteric Recordings]].\n\n2013 marked the first Hawkeaster, a two-day festival held in Seaton, Devon during the Easter weekend. A US tour was booked for October 2013, but due to health issues, was postponed and later cancelled.\n\nIn February 2014, as part of a one-off Space Ritual performance, Hawkwind performed at the O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire featuring an appearance by [[Brian Blessed]] for the spoken word element of Sonic Attack; a studio recording of this performance was released as a single in September 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cherryred.co.uk/shopnews.asp?type=Hawkwind%20launch%20a%20Sonic%20Attack%20on%20the%20singles%20chart%20with%20a%20little%20help%20from%20Brian%20Blessed!|title=Hawkwind launch a Sonic Attack on the singles chart with a little help from Brian Blessed!\n|accessdate = 24 December 2014\n|date=3 September 2014\n|publisher=Cherry Red Records\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224034423/http://www.cherryred.co.uk/shopnews.asp?type=Hawkwind%20launch%20a%20Sonic%20Attack%20on%20the%20singles%20chart%20with%20a%20little%20help%20from%20Brian%20Blessed!\n|archivedate=24 December 2014\n|dead-url=no\n}}</ref> Later in the year, former Soft Machine guitarist [[John Etheridge]] joined the live line-up of the band, though he had departed again prior to early 2015 dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv0RLLJ1cpU|title=Hawkwind, Highrise feat.

Hawkwind performed two Solstice Ritual shows in December 2015, with [[Steve Hillage]] guesting, and Haz Wheaton joining Hawkwind on bass guitar. Wheaton is a former member of the band's road crew who had previously appeared with Technicians of Spaceship Hawkwind, a \"skeleton crew\" spin off live band. Additionally, he had guested on bass for Dave Brock's solo album ''Brockworld'' released earlier in the year.\n\nThe band released ''[[The Machine Stops (album)|The Machine Stops]]'' on 15 April 2016. The album marked Wheaton's first appearance on a Hawkwind studio album, and the first album without Tim Blake's involvement since he had rejoined the band in 2010 and appeared on ''Blood of the Earth''. His departure was offset by increased synthesiser work by Hone and Brock.\n\nDead Fred's last live appearance with Hawkwind was at The Eastbourne Winter Gardens April 1, 2016. Hone took over keyboards and synth duties live until though Blake returned for shows in summer 2016.\n\nIt was announced in November 2016 that Hawkwind were recording a new studio album, entitled ''[[Into the Woods (Hawkwind album)|Into The Woods]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/HawkwindHQ/posts/1390918810921016|title=Hawkwind|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref> Keyboardist-guitarist Magnus Martin replaced both Hone and Blake in the lineup for the new album, leaving the 2017 core band composed of Brock, Chadwick, Mr Dibs, Wheaton and Martin.\n\nIn 2018, Hawkwind recorded an acoustic album ''[[The Road to Utopia]]'' consisting primarily of [[cover versions]] of their 1970s songs with production, arrangement and additional orchestrations by [[Mike Batt]] and a guest appearance from [[Eric Clapton]].

It is an [[odd-toed ungulate]] [[mammal]] belonging to the taxonomic family [[Equidae]]. The horse has [[evolution of the horse|evolved]] over the past 45 to 55&nbsp;million years from a small multi-toed creature, ''[[Eohippus]]'', into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began [[Domestication|domesticating]] horses around 4000 BC, and their [[domestication of the horse|domestication]] is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies ''caballus'' are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as [[feral horse]]s. These feral populations are not true [[wild horse]]s, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered [[Przewalski's horse]], a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true [[wild horse]]. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from [[equine anatomy|anatomy]] to life stages, size, [[equine coat color|colors]], [[horse markings|markings]], [[horse breed|breeds]], [[horse gait|locomotion]], and behavior.\n\nHorses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed [[Equilibrioception|sense of balance]] and a strong [[fight-or-flight response]]. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thespruce.com/learn-how-all-horses-sleep-1887328|title=Do You Know How Horses Sleep?|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref> Female horses, called [[mare]]s, carry their young for approximately 11&nbsp;months, and a young horse, called a [[foal]], can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under [[saddle]] or in [[Horse harness|harness]] between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30&nbsp;years.\n\nHorse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited \"hot bloods\" with speed and endurance; \"cold bloods\", such as [[draft horse]]s and some [[Pony|ponies]], suitable for slow, heavy work; and \"[[warmblood]]s\", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300&nbsp;breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.\n\nHorses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as [[Mounted police|police work]], [[working animal|agriculture]], entertainment, and [[hippotherapy|therapy]]. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[driving (horse)|driving]] techniques developed, using many different styles of [[Horse tack|equipment]] and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as [[veterinarian]]s and [[farrier]]s.\n\n==Biology==\n{{Main|Equine anatomy}}\n[[File:Points of a horse.jpg|thumb|Points of a horse<ref>{{cite book|last=Goody|first=John|title=Horse Anatomy|edition=2nd|publisher=J A Allen|isbn=978-0-85131-769-4|year=2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Pavord|first1=Tony|last2=Pavord|first2=Marcy|title=Complete Equine Veterinary Manual|publisher=David & Charles|isbn=978-0-7153-1883-6|year=2007}}</ref>|upright=1.5|alt=Diagram of a horse with some parts labeled.]]\nSpecific terms and specialized language are used to describe [[equine anatomy]], different life stages, colors and breeds.\n\n===Lifespan and life stages===\nDepending on breed, [[horse management|management]] and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30&nbsp;years.<ref name=Ensminger46/> Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_age.htm|title=The Age of a Horse|publisher=Government of Ontario|website=Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs|author=Wright, B.|date=March 29, 1999|accessdate=2009-10-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120031232/http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_age.htm|archivedate=January 20, 2010|df=}}</ref> The oldest verifiable record was \"[[Old Billy]]\", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62.<ref name=Ensminger46/> In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=9708|title= World's Oldest Living Pony Dies at 56|accessdate=2007-05-31 |author= Ryder, Erin |website= The Horse}}</ref>\n\nRegardless of a horse or pony's actual birth date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each January&nbsp;1 of each year in the Northern Hemisphere<ref name=Ensminger46/><ref>{{cite book |title= The Manual of Horsemanship of the British Horse Society and the Pony Club |author=British Horse Society |year=1966|edition=6th edition, reprinted 1970 |publisher= British Horse Society |location= Kenilworth, UK |isbn= 978-0-9548863-1-8|page= 255}}</ref> and each August&nbsp;1 in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.studbook.org.au/DisplayPDF.aspx?ty=RULES |format=PDF |title= Rules of the Australian Stud Book |accessdate=2008-07-09 |year= 2007 |publisher=Australian Jockey Club |page=7}}</ref> The exception is in [[endurance riding]], where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar age.<ref name=Endurance>{{cite web|url= http://www.aerc.org/HorseAge.aspx|title= Equine Age Requirements for AERC Rides|accessdate= 2011-07-25|publisher= American Endurance Riding Conference|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110811110201/http://aerc.org/HorseAge.aspx|archivedate= 2011-08-11|df= }}</ref>\n\nThe following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:\n\n* [[Foal]]: A foal of either sex less than one year old.

In an adult horse, there are 12&nbsp;[[incisor]]s at the front of the mouth, adapted to biting off the grass or other vegetation. There are 24&nbsp;teeth adapted for chewing, the [[premolar]]s and [[Molar (tooth)|molars]], at the back of the mouth. Stallions and geldings have four additional teeth just behind the incisors, a type of [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]] called \"tushes\". Some horses, both male and female, will also develop one to four very small [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] teeth in front of the molars, known as \"wolf\" teeth, which are generally removed because they can interfere with the [[bit (horse)|bit]]. There is an empty interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests directly on the gums, or \"bars\" of the horse's mouth when the horse is [[bridle]]d.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kreling |first=Kai |title=Horses' Teeth and Their Problems: Prevention, Recognition, and Treatment |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=3q1LINmOkOIC&pg=PA117-IA1 |year=2005 |publisher=Globe Pequot |location=Guilford, CT |isbn=978-1-59228-696-6 |chapter=The Horse's Teeth |oclc=59163221|pages= 12\u201313}}</ref>\n\nAn estimate of a horse's age can be made from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough estimate of a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.<ref name=Ensminger46>[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], pp. 46\u201350</ref>\n\n====Digestion====\n{{Main|Equine anatomy#Digestive system|Equine nutrition|l1=Equine digestive system}}\nHorses are [[herbivore]]s with a digestive system adapted to a [[forage]] diet of grasses and other plant material, consumed steadily throughout the day. Therefore, compared to humans, they have a relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate a steady flow of nutrients. A {{convert|450|kg|adj=on}} horse will eat {{convert|7|to|11|kg}} of food per day and, under normal use, drink {{convert|38|to|45|L}} of [[water]]. Horses are not [[ruminant]]s, they have only one stomach, like humans, but unlike humans, they can utilize [[cellulose]], a major component of grass. Horses are [[hindgut fermentation|hindgut fermenters]]. Cellulose fermentation by symbiotic bacteria occurs in the [[cecum]], or \"water gut\", which food goes through before reaching the [[large intestine]].

The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.<ref name=\"Olsen\"/>\n\nHorses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions.

The method of judging varies with the discipline, but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider.<ref>[[#Edwards|Edwards]], pp. 376\u2013377</ref>\nSports such as [[polo]] do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions\u2014be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task.<ref name=Edwards360>[[#Edwards|Edwards]], p. 360</ref> Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include [[jousting]], in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Collins, Tony |author2= Martin, John |author3= Vamplew, Wray  |title=Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NWu6sLJn7-kC&pg=PA174|publisher=Routledge |year=2005|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-415-35224-6|oclc=57005595|pages=173\u2013174}}</ref> and [[buzkashi]], a team game played throughout [[Central Asia]], the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.<ref name=Edwards360/>\n\n[[Horse racing]] is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world.

He was also the first person to describe the [[learning curve]]. He was the father of the eminent [[Neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantian]] philosopher [[Julius Ebbinghaus]].\n\n==Early life==\nEbbinghaus was born in [[Barmen]], in the [[Rhine Province]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], as the son of a wealthy merchant, Carl Ebbinghaus. Little is known about his infancy except that he was brought up in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] faith and was a pupil at the town [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]. At the age of 17 (1867), he began attending the [[University of Bonn]], where he had planned to study [[history]] and [[philology]]. However, during his time there he developed an interest in [[philosophy]]. In 1870, his studies were interrupted when he served with the Prussian Army in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Following this short stint in the military, Ebbinghaus finished his dissertation on [[Eduard von Hartmann]]'s ''{{lang|de|Philosophie des Unbewussten}}'' (philosophy of the unconscious) and received his doctorate on August 16, 1873, when he was 23 years old. During the next three years, he spent time at [[University of Halle|Halle]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Wozniak, R.

In England, he may have taught in two small schools in the south of the country (Gorfein, 1885). In [[London]], in a used bookstore, he came across [[Gustav Fechner]]'s book ''Elemente der Psychophysik'' (''Elements of Psychophysics''), which spurred him to conduct his famous memory experiments. After beginning his studies at the University of Berlin, he founded the third psychological testing lab in Germany (third to [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Georg Elias M\u00fcller]]).<ref name=\"Herman Ebbinghaus, 1968\">Hermann Ebbinghaus. (1968). Retrieved from International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences: http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Hermann_Ebbinghaus.aspx</ref> He began his memory studies here in 1879. In 1885 \u2014 the same year that he published his monumental work, ''\u00dcber das Ged\u00e4chtnis. Untersuchungen zur experimentellen Psychologie'', later published in English under the title ''Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology''<ref name=\"Memory\">Ebbinghaus, H. (1913).. (H. Ruger, & C. Bussenius, Trans.) New York, NY: Teachers College.</ref> \u2014 he was made a professor at the [[University of Berlin]], most likely in recognition of this publication. In 1890, along with [[Arthur K\u00f6nig]], he founded the psychological journal ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physiologie und Psychologie der Sinnesorgane'' (\"The Psychology and Physiology of the Sense Organs'\").\n\nIn 1894, he was passed over for promotion to head of the philosophy department at [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], most likely due to his lack of publications. Instead, [[Carl Stumpf]] received the promotion. As a result of this, Ebbinghaus left to join the [[University of Breslau]] (now [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Poland]]), in a chair left open by [[Theodor Lipps]] (who took over Stumpf's position when he moved to Berlin).<ref name=\"Herman Ebbinghaus, 1968\" /> While in [[Breslau]], he worked on a commission that studied how children's mental ability declined during the school day. While the specifics on how these mental abilities were measured have been lost, the successes achieved by the commission laid the groundwork for future [[intelligence testing]].<ref name=\"Thorne\">{{cite book |last=Thorne |first=B. M. |last2=Henley |first2=T. B. |year=2001 |title=Connections in the history and systems of psychology |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-618-04535-X }}</ref>{{rp|207}} At Breslau, he again founded a psychological testing laboratory.\n\nIn 1902, Ebbinghaus published his next piece of writing entitled ''Die Grundz\u00fcge der Psychologie'' (''Fundamentals of Psychology''). It was an instant success and continued to be long after his death. In 1904, he moved to [[University of Halle|Halle]] where he spent the last few years of his life. His last published work, ''Abriss der Psychologie'' (''Outline of Psychology'') was published six years later, in 1908. This, too, continued to be a success, being re-released in eight different editions.<ref name=\"Thorne\" />{{rp|208}} Shortly after this publication, on February 26, 1909,<ref name=\"Herman Ebbinghaus, 1968\" /> Ebbinghaus died from [[pneumonia]] at the age of 59.\n\n==Research on memory==\nEbbinghaus was determined to show that higher mental processes could actually be studied using [[experimentation]], which was in opposition to the popularly held thought of the time.  To control for most potentially confounding variables, Ebbinghaus wanted to use simple acoustic encoding and [[rehearsal|maintenance rehearsal]] for which a list of words could have been used.  As [[learning]] would be affected by prior knowledge and understanding, he needed something that could be easily memorized but which had no prior cognitive associations.  Easily formable associations with regular words would interfere with his results, so he used items that would later be called \"[[nonsense syllable]]s\" (also known as the [[CVC trigram]]). A nonsense syllable is a [[consonant]]-[[vowel]]-consonant combination, where the consonant does not repeat and the syllable does not have prior meaning.  BOL (sounds like \"Ball\") and DOT (already a word) would then not be allowed.  However, syllables such as DAX, BOK, and YAT would all be acceptable (though Ebbinghaus left no examples).  After eliminating the meaning-laden syllables, Ebbinghaus ended up with 2,300 resultant syllables.<ref name=\"Memory\" />  Once he had created his collection of syllables, he would pull out a number of random syllables from a box and then write them down in a notebook.  Then, to the regular sound of a [[metronome]], and with the same voice [[inflection]], he would read out the syllables, and attempt to [[Recall (memory)|recall]] them at the end of the procedure.  One [[research|investigation]] alone required 15,000 recitations.\n\nIt was later determined that humans impose meaning even on nonsense syllables to make them more meaningful.  The nonsense syllable PED (which is the first three letters of the word \"pedal\") turns out to be less nonsensical than a syllable such as KOJ; the syllables are said to differ in [[association value]].<ref>Glaze, J. A. (1928).  The association value of non-sense syllables.  ''Pedagogical Seminary and Journal of Genetic Psychology, 35'', 255-269.</ref>  It appears that Ebbinghaus recognized this, and only referred to the strings of syllables as \"nonsense\" in that the syllables might be less likely to have a specific meaning and he should make no attempt to make associations with them for easier retrieval.<ref name=\"Memory\" />\n\n==Limitations to memory research==\nThere are several limitations to his work on memory. The most important one was that Ebbinghaus was the only subject in his study. This limited the study's [[generalizability]] to the population. Although he attempted to regulate his daily routine to maintain more control over his results, his decision to avoid the use of participants sacrificed the [[external validity]] of the study despite sound [[internal validity]].  In addition, although he tried to account for his personal influences, there is an inherent bias when someone serves as researcher as well as participant. Also, Ebbinghaus's memory research halted research in other, more complex matters of memory such as [[semantic]] and [[procedural memory]] and [[mnemonics]].<ref name=\"Thorne & Henley, 2005\">Thorne, B., Henley, T. (2005). Hermann Ebbinghaus in Connections in the History and Systems of Psychology (3rd Edition ed., pp. 211-216). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Cengage Learning.</ref>\n\n==Contributions to memory==\nIn 1885, he published his groundbreaking ''\u00dcber das Ged\u00e4chtnis'' (\"On Memory\", later translated to English as ''Memory. A Contribution to Experimental Psychology'') in which he described experiments he conducted on himself to describe the processes of [[learning]] and [[forgetting]].\n\nEbbinghaus made several findings that are still relevant and supported to this day. First, arguably his most famous finding,  the [[forgetting curve]]. The forgetting curve describes the [[Exponential decay|exponential]] loss of information that one has learned.<ref>T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. \"Unit 7: Memory.\" pp. 126 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/TLBrink_PSYCH07.pdf]</ref> The sharpest decline occurs in the first twenty minutes and the decay is  significant through the first hour. The curve levels off after about one day.[[File:ForgettingCurve.svg|thumb|200px|right|A typical representation of the [[forgetting curve]]]]\n\nThe [[learning curve]] described by Ebbinghaus refers to how fast one learns information. The sharpest increase occurs after the first try and then gradually evens out, meaning that less and less new information is retained after each repetition. Like the forgetting curve, the learning curve is exponential. Ebbinghaus had also documented the [[serial position effect]], which describes how the position of an item affects recall. The two main concepts in the serial position effect are recency and primacy. The recency effect describes the increased recall of the most recent information because it is still in the short-term memory. The primacy effect causes better memory of the first items in a list due to increased rehearsal and commitment to long-term memory.\n\nAnother important discovery is that of savings. This refers to the amount of information retained in the [[subconscious]] even after this information cannot be consciously accessed. Ebbinghaus would memorize a list of items until perfect [[recollection|recall]] and then would not access the list until he could no longer recall any of its items. He then would relearn the list, and compare the new learning curve to the learning curve of his previous memorization of the list. The second list was generally memorized faster, and this difference between the two learning curves is what Ebbinghaus called \"savings\". Ebbinghaus also described the difference between involuntary and voluntary memory, the former occurring \"with apparent spontaneity and without any act of the will\" and the latter being brought \"into consciousness by an exertion of the will\".\n\nPrior to Ebbinghaus, most contributions to the study of memory were undertaken by philosophers and centered on observational description and speculation. For example, [[Immanuel Kant]] used pure description to discuss recognition and its components and [[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]] claimed that the simple observation of the rote recollection of a previously learned list was \"no use to the art\" of memory. This dichotomy between descriptive and experimental study of memory would resonate later in Ebbinghaus's life, particularly in his public argument with former colleague [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]. However, more than a century before Ebbinghaus, [[Johann Andreas Segner]] invented the \"Segner-wheel\" to see the length of after-images by seeing how fast a wheel with a hot [[coal]] attached had to move for the red ember circle from the coal to appear complete. (see [[iconic memory]])\n\nEbbinghaus's effect on memory research was almost immediate. With very few works published on memory in the previous two millennia, Ebbinghaus's works spurred memory research in the [[United States]] in the 1890s, with 32 papers published in 1894 alone. This research was coupled with the growing development of mechanized [[mnemometer]]s, or devices that aided in the recording and study of memory.\n\nThe reaction to his work in his day was mostly positive. Noted psychologist [[William James]] called the studies \"heroic\" and said that they were \"the single most brilliant investigation in the history of psychology\". [[Edward B. Titchener]] also mentioned that the studies were the greatest undertaking in the topic of memory since [[Aristotle]].\n\n==Other contributions==\nEbbinghaus can also be credited with pioneering sentence completion exercises, which he developed in studying the abilities of schoolchildren. It was these same exercises that [[Alfred Binet]] had borrowed and incorporated into the [[IQ|Binet-Simon intelligence scale]]. Sentence completion had since then also been used extensively in memory research, especially in tapping into measures of [[implicit memory]], and also has been used in [[psychotherapy]] as a tool to help tap into the motivations and drives of the patient. He had also influenced [[Charlotte B\u00fchler]], who along with [[Lev Vygotsky]] and others went on to study [[language]] meaning and [[society]].\n[[File:Mond-vergleich.svg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Ebbinghaus Illusion]]. Note that the orange circles appear of different sizes, even though equal.]] Ebbinghaus is also credited with discovering an [[optical illusion]] now known after its discoverer\u2014the [[Ebbinghaus illusion]], which is an illusion of relative size perception. In the best-known version of this illusion, two circles of identical size are placed near to each other and one is surrounded by large circles while the other is surrounded by small circles; the first central circle then appears smaller than the second central circle. This illusion is now used extensively in research in [[cognitive psychology]], to find out more about the various [[perception]] pathways in our [[Human brain|brain]].\n\nEbbinghaus is also largely credited with drafting the first standard research report. In his paper on memory, Ebbinghaus arranged his research into four sections: the introduction, the methods, the results, and a discussion section. The clarity and organization of this format was so impressive to contemporaries that it has now become standard in the discipline, and all research reports follow the same standards laid out by Ebbinghaus.\n\nUnlike notable contemporaries like Titchener and James, Ebbinghaus did not promote any specific [[school of psychology]] nor was he known for extensive lifetime research, having done only three works. He never attempted to bestow upon himself the title of the pioneer of [[experimental psychology]], did not seek to have any \"[[wikt:disciple|disciples]]\", and left the exploitation of the new field to others.\n\n==Discourse on the nature of psychology==\nIn addition to pioneering experimental psychology, Ebbinghaus was also a strong defender of this direction of the new science, as is illustrated by his public dispute with University of Berlin colleague, [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]. Shortly after Ebbinghaus left Berlin in 1893, Dilthey published a paper extolling the virtues of descriptive psychology, and condemning experimental psychology as boring, claiming that the [[mind]] was too complex, and that [[introspection]] was the desired method of studying the mind. The debate at the time had been primarily whether psychology should aim to explain or understand the mind and whether it belonged to the [[natural sciences|natural]] or [[human sciences]]. Many had seen Dilthey's work as an outright attack on experimental psychology, Ebbinghaus included, and he responded to Dilthey with a personal letter and also a long scathing public article. Amongst his counterarguments against Dilthey he mentioned that it is inevitable for psychology to do [[hypothetical]] work and that the kind of psychology that Dilthey was attacking was the one that existed before Ebbinghaus's \"experimental revolution\". [[Charlotte B\u00fchler]] echoed his words some forty years later, stating that people like Ebbinghaus \"buried the old psychology in the 1890s\". Ebbinghaus explained his scathing review by saying that he could not believe that Dilthey was advocating the [[status quo]] of [[structuralism|structuralists]] like [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and Titchener and attempting to stifle psychology's progress.\n\nSome contemporary texts still describe Ebbinghaus as a philosopher rather than a psychologist and he had also spent his life as a professor of philosophy. However, Ebbinghaus himself would probably describe himself as a psychologist considering that he fought to have psychology viewed as a separate discipline from philosophy.\n\n==Influences==\nThere has been some speculation as to what influenced Ebbinghaus in his undertakings. None of his professors seem to have influenced him, nor are there suggestions that his colleagues affected him. Von Hartmann's work, on which Ebbinghaus based his doctorate, did suggest that higher mental processes were hidden from view, which may have spurred Ebbinghaus to attempt to prove otherwise. The one influence that has always been cited as having inspired Ebbinghaus was [[Gustav Fechner]]'s two-volume ''Elemente der Psychophysik.'' (\"Elements of Psychophysics\", 1860), a book which he purchased second-hand in England. It is said that the meticulous mathematical procedures impressed Ebbinghaus so much that he wanted to do for [[psychology]] what Fechner had done for [[psychophysics]]. This inspiration is also evident in that Ebbinghaus dedicated his second work ''Principles of Psychology'' to Fechner, signing it \"I owe everything to you.\"<ref name=\"Thorne\" />{{rp|206}}\n\n== Selected publications ==\n* Ebbinghaus, H.

Huginn and Muninn are attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources: the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]; in the ''[[Third Grammatical Treatise]]'', compiled in the 13th century by [[\u00d3l\u00e1fr \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson]]; and in the poetry of [[skald]]s. The names of the ravens are sometimes modernly [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] as '''Hugin''' and '''Munin'''.\n\nIn the ''Poetic Edda'', a disguised Odin expresses that he fears that they may not return from their daily flights. The ''Prose Edda'' explains that Odin is referred to as \"[[List of names of Odin|raven-god]]\" due to his association with Huginn and Muninn. In the ''Prose Edda'' and the ''Third Grammatical Treatise'', the two ravens are described as perching on Odin's shoulders. ''Heimskringla'' details that Odin gave Huginn and Muninn the ability to speak.\n\n[[Migration Period]] golden [[bracteate]]s, [[Vendel era]] helmet plates, a pair of identical [[Germanic Iron Age]] bird-shaped brooches, [[Viking Age]] objects depicting a moustached man wearing a helmet, and a portion of the 10th or 11th century [[Manx Runestones#Thorwald's Cross: Br Olsen;185A (Andreas (III), MM 128)|Thorwald's Cross]] may depict Odin with one of the ravens. Huginn and Muninn's role as Odin's messengers has been linked to [[shaman]]ic practices, the Norse [[raven banner]], general raven symbolism among the [[Germanic peoples]], and the Norse concepts of the [[fylgja]] and the [[hamingja]].\n\n==Attestations==\n[[File:Odin, der G\u00f6ttervater.jpg|thumb|[[Odin]] enthroned and holding his spear [[Gungnir]],  flanked by his ravens Huginn and Muninn and wolves [[Geri and Freki]] (1882) by [[Carl Emil Doepler]]]]\nIn the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l]]'', the god [[Odin]] (disguised as ''[[List of names of Odin|Gr\u00edmnir]]'') provides the young [[Agnarr Geirr\u00f6\u00f0sson|Agnarr]] with information about Odin's companions. He tells the prince about Odin's wolves [[Geri and Freki]], and, in the next stanza of the poem, states that Huginn and Muninn fly daily across the entire world, [[Midgard]]. Gr\u00edmnir says that he worries Huginn may not come back, yet more does he fear for Muninn:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>[[Benjamin Thorpe]] translation:</small>\n:Hugin and Munin fly each day\n:over the spacious earth.\n:I fear for Hugin, that he come not back,\n:yet more anxious am I for Munin.<ref name=THORPE21>Thorpe (1907:21).</ref>\n|\n:<small>[[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] translation:</small>\n:O'er [[Midgard|Mithgarth]] Hugin and Munin both\n:Each day set forth to fly;\n:For Hugin I fear lest he come not home,\n:But for Munin my care is more.<ref name=BELLOWS92>Bellows (1923:92).</ref>\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\nIn the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' (chapter 38), the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] tells [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (king [[Gylfi]] in disguise) that two ravens named Huginn and Muninn sit on Odin's shoulders. The ravens tell Odin everything they see and hear. Odin sends Huginn and Muninn out at dawn, and the birds fly all over the world before returning at dinner-time. As a result, Odin is kept informed of many events. High adds that it is from this association that Odin is referred to as \"[[List of names of Odin|raven-god]]\". The above-mentioned stanza from ''Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l'' is then quoted.<ref name=FAULKES33>Faulkes (1995:33).</ref>\n\nIn the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' (chapter 60), Huginn and Muninn appear in a list of poetic names for ravens. In the same chapter, excerpts from a work by the skald [[Einarr Sk\u00falason]] are provided. In these excerpts Muninn is referenced in a common noun for 'raven' and Huginn is referenced in a [[kenning]] for 'carrion'.<ref name=FAULKES138AND244AND247>Faulkes (1995:138, 244, and 247).</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' book ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'', an [[euhemerism|euhemerized]] account of the life of Odin is provided. Chapter 7 describes that Odin had two ravens, and upon these ravens he bestowed the gift of speech. These ravens flew all over the land and brought him information, causing Odin to become \"very wise in his lore.\"<ref name=HOLLANDER11>Hollander (2007:11).</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Third Grammatical Treatise]]'' an anonymous verse is recorded that mentions the ravens flying from Odin's shoulders; Huginn seeking hanged men, and Muninn slain bodies. The verse reads:\n<blockquote>\n:Two ravens flew from [[List of names of Odin|Hnikar]]\u2019s [\u00d3\u00f0inn\u2019s]\n:shoulders; Huginn to the hanged and\n:Muninn to the slain [lit.  corpses].<ref name=WILLS8>Wills (2006:8).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Archaeological record==\n[[Image:Bracteate from Funen, Denmark (DR BR42).jpg|thumb|A [[Bracteate#Typology|C-type bracteate]] ([[Alu (runic)#DR BR42|DR BR42]]) featuring a figure above a horse flanked by a bird.]]\n[[File:Del av hj\u00e4lm vendel vendeltid m\u00f6jligen oden.jpg|thumb|A plate from a [[Vendel era]] helmet featuring a figure riding a horse, holding a spear and shield, and confronted by a serpent. The rider is accompanied by two birds.]]\n[[Migration Period]] (5th and 6th centuries CE) gold [[bracteate]]s (types A, B, and C) feature a depiction of a human figure above a horse, holding a spear and flanked by one or more often two birds. The presence of the birds has led to the iconographic identification of the human figure as the god Odin, flanked by Huginn and Muninn. Like Snorri's ''Prose Edda'' description of the ravens, a bird is sometimes depicted at the ear of the human, or at the ear of the horse. Bracteates have been found in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and, in smaller numbers, [[England]] and areas south of Denmark.<ref name=SIMEK43AND164>Simek (2007:43 and 164).</ref> Austrian Germanist [[Rudolf Simek]] states that these bracteates may depict Odin and his ravens healing a horse and may indicate that the birds were originally not simply his battlefield companions but also \"Odin's helpers in his veterinary function.\"<ref name=SIMEK164>Simek (2007:164).</ref>\n\n[[Vendel era]] helmet plates (from the 6th or 7th century) found in a grave in Sweden depict a helmeted figure holding a spear and a shield while riding a horse, flanked by two birds. The plate has been interpreted as Odin accompanied by two birds: his ravens.<ref name=SIMEK164LINDOW187>Simek (2007:164) and Lindow (2005:187).</ref>\n\nA pair of identical [[Germanic Iron Age]] bird-shaped brooches from [[Bejsebakke]] in northern Denmark may be depictions of Huginn and Muninn. The back of each bird features a mask motif, and the feet of the birds are shaped like the heads of animals. The feathers of the birds are also composed of animal heads. Together, the animal heads on the feathers form a mask on the back of the bird. The birds have powerful beaks and fan-shaped tails, indicating that they are ravens. The brooches were intended to be worn on each shoulder, after Germanic Iron Age fashion.<ref name=PETERSEN62>Petersen (1990:62).</ref> Archaeologist Peter Vang Petersen comments that while the symbolism of the brooches is open to debate, the shape of the beaks and tail feathers confirm that the brooch depictions are ravens.

[[John Lindow]] relates Odin's ability to send his \"thought\" (Huginn) and \"mind\" (Muninn) to the [[trance]]-state journey of [[shaman]]s. Lindow says the  ''Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l'' stanza where Odin worries about the return of Huginn and Muninn \"would be consistent with the danger that the shaman faces on the trance-state journey.\"<ref name=LINDOW188>Lindow (2001:188).</ref>\n\nRudolf Simek is critical of the approach, stating that \"attempts have been made to interpret Odin's ravens as a personification of the god's intellectual powers, but this can only be assumed from the names Huginn and Muninn themselves which were unlikely to have been invented much before the 9th or 10th centuries\" yet that the two ravens, as Odin's companions, appear to derive from much earlier times.<ref name=SIMEK164>Simek (2007:164).</ref> Instead, Simek connects Huginn and Muninn with wider raven symbolism in the Germanic world, including the [[raven banner]] (described in English chronicles and Scandinavian sagas), a banner which was woven in a method that allowed it, when fluttering in the wind, to appear as if the raven depicted upon it was beating its wings.<ref name=SIMEK164/>\n\nAnthony Winterbourne connects Huginn and Muninn to the Norse concepts of the [[fylgja]]\u2014a concept with three characteristics; shape-shifting abilities, good fortune, and the guardian spirit\u2014and the [[hamingja]]\u2014the ghostly double of a person that may appear in the form of an animal. Winterbourne states that \"The shaman's journey through the different parts of the cosmos is symbolized by the ''hamingja'' concept of the shape-shifting soul, and gains another symbolic dimension for the Norse soul in the account of O\u00f0in's ravens, Huginn and Muninn.\"<ref name=WINTERBOURNE38-41>Winterbourne (2004:38\u201341).</ref> In response to Simek's criticism of attempts to interpret the ravens \"philosophically\", Winterbourne says that \"such speculations [...] simply strengthen the conceptual significance made plausible by other features of the mythology\" and that the names ''Huginn'' and ''Muninn'' \"demand more explanation than is usually provided.\"<ref name=WINTERBOURNE38-41/>\n\nThe ''[[Heliand]]'', an [[Old Saxon]] adaptation of the [[New Testament]] from the 9th century, differs from the New Testament in that an explicit reference is made to a dove sitting on the shoulder of [[Christ]]. Regarding this, G. Ronald Murphy says \"In placing the powerful white dove not just above Christ, but right on his shoulder, the ''Heliand'' author has portrayed Christ, not only as the Son of the All-Ruler, but also as a new Woden. This deliberate image of Christ triumphantly astride the land with the magnificent bird on his shoulders (the author is perhaps a bit embarrassed that the bird is an unwarlike dove!) is an image intended to calm the fears and longings of those who mourn the loss of Woden and who want to return to the old religion's symbols and ways. With this image, Christ becomes a Germanic god, one into whose ears the Spirit of the Almighty whispers\".<ref name=\"MURPHY-79-80\">Murphy (1989:79-80).</ref>\n\n[[Bernd Heinrich]] theorizes that Huginn and Muninn, along with Odin and his wolves [[Geri and Freki]], reflect a [[symbiosis]] observed in the natural world among ravens, wolves, and humans on the hunt:\n<blockquote>\n:In a biological symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As in such a symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) who were part of him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered to the ends of the earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part\u2014he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.<ref name=\"HEINRICH-355\">Heinrich (2006 [1999]: 355).

J. Van Wylen and R. E. Sonntag: \"A heat engine may be defined as a device that operates in a thermodynamic cycle and does a certain amount of net positive work as a result of heat transfer from a high-[[temperature]] body and to a low-temperature body. Often the term heat engine is used in a broader sense to include all devices that produce work, either through heat transfer or combustion, even though the device does not operate in a thermodynamic cycle. The internal-combustion engine and the gas turbine are examples of such devices, and calling these heat engines is an acceptable use of the term.\"</ref><ref>''Mechanical efficiency of heat engines'', p. 1 (2007) by James R. Senf: \"Heat engines are made to provide mechanical energy from thermal energy.\"</ref> It does this by bringing a [[working substance]] from a higher state temperature to a lower state temperature. A heat source generates thermal energy that brings the working substance to the high temperature state. The working substance generates work in the [[Thermodynamic system|working body]] of the engine while [[Heat transfer|transferring heat]] to the colder [[Thermal reservoir|sink]] until it reaches a low temperature state. During this process some of the thermal energy is converted into [[energy|work]] by exploiting the properties of the working substance. The working substance can be any system with a non-zero [[heat capacity]], but it usually is a gas or liquid. During this process, a lot of heat is lost to the surroundings and so cannot be converted to work.\n\nIn general an [[engine]] converts energy to mechanical [[Work (physics)|work]]. Heat engines distinguish themselves from other types of engines by the fact that their efficiency is fundamentally limited by [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]].<ref>''Thermal physics: entropy and free energies'', by Joon Chang Lee (2002), Appendix A, p. 183: \"A heat engine absorbs energy from a heat source and then converts it into work for us.... When the engine absorbs heat energy, the absorbed heat energy comes with entropy.\" (heat energy <math>\\Delta Q=T \\Delta S</math>), \"When the engine performs work, on the other hand, no entropy leaves the engine. This is problematic. We would like the engine to repeat the process again and again to provide us with a steady work source. ... to do so, the working substance inside the engine must return to its initial thermodynamic condition after a cycle, which requires to remove the remaining entropy. The engine can do this only in one way. It must let part of the absorbed heat energy leave without converting it into work. Therefore the engine cannot convert all of the input energy into work!\"</ref> Although this efficiency limitation can be a drawback, an advantage of heat engines is that most forms of energy can be easily converted to heat by processes like [[exothermic reaction]]s (such as combustion), [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of light or energetic particles, [[friction]], [[dissipation]] and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]. Since the heat source that supplies thermal energy to the engine can thus be powered by virtually any kind of energy, heat engines are very versatile and have a wide range of applicability.\n\nHeat engines are often confused with the cycles they attempt to implement. Typically, the term \"engine\" is used for a physical device and \"cycle\" for the model.\n\n==Overview==\n[[Image:heat engine.png|300px|thumb|right|Figure 1: Heat engine diagram]]\n\nIn [[thermodynamics]], heat engines are often modeled using a standard engineering model such as the [[Otto cycle]]. The theoretical model can be refined and augmented with actual data from an operating engine, using tools such as an [[indicator diagram]]. Since very few actual implementations of heat engines exactly match their underlying thermodynamic cycles, one could say that a thermodynamic cycle is an ideal case of a mechanical engine. In any case, fully understanding an engine and its efficiency requires gaining a good understanding of the (possibly simplified or idealized) theoretical model, the practical nuances of an actual mechanical engine, and the discrepancies between the two.\n\nIn general terms, the larger the difference in temperature between the hot source and the cold sink, the larger is the potential [[thermal efficiency]] of the cycle. On Earth, the cold side of any heat engine is limited to being close to the ambient temperature of the environment, or not much lower than 300 [[kelvin]]s, so most efforts to improve the thermodynamic efficiencies of various heat engines focus on increasing the temperature of the source, within material limits. The maximum theoretical efficiency of a heat engine (which no engine ever attains) is equal to the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends divided by the temperature at the hot end, all expressed as [[absolute temperature]]s (in [[kelvin]]s).\n\nThe efficiency of various heat engines proposed or used today has a large range: \n* 3%<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mahmoud_Shaaban7/publication/237251713_EXPERIMENTAL_INVESTIGATIONS_ON_A_STANDING-WAVE_THERMOACOUSTIC_ENGINE/links/58ecf2870f7e9bf619bb01e2/EXPERIMENTAL-INVESTIGATIONS-ON-A-STANDING-WAVE-THERMOACOUSTIC-ENGINE.pdf |title=Experimental Investigations on a Standing-Wave Thermoacoustic Engine |last=Eman |first=Mahmod Mohamed |date=June 2013 |access-date=January 21, 2018 |publisher=[[Cairo University]] |work=[[ResearchGate]] |format=PDF |location=Giza, Egypt}}</ref> (97 percent waste heat using low quality heat) for the [[Ocean thermal energy conversion|OTEC]] ocean power proposal.\n* 25% for most automotive gasoline engines <ref>[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/atv.shtml  Where the Energy Goes: Gasoline Vehicles], US Dept of Energy</ref>\n* 49% for a [[Supercritical steam generator|supercritical]] [[coal-fired power station]] such as the [[Aved\u00f8re Power Station]], and many others\n* 60% for a steam-cooled [[combined cycle]] [[gas turbine]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Efficiency by the Numbers| url=http://memagazine.asme.org/Web/Efficiency_by_Numbers.cfm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616132320/http://memagazine.asme.org/Web/Efficiency_by_Numbers.cfm| archivedate=16 June 2009| last1=Langston| first1=Lee S.| publisher=ASME| deadurl=yes| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAll these processes gain their efficiency (or lack thereof) from the temperature drop across them. Significant energy may be used for auxiliary equipment, such as pumps, which effectively reduces efficiency.\n\n===Power===\nHeat engines can be characterized by their [[power density|specific power]], which is typically given in kilowatts per litre of [[engine displacement]] (in the U.S. also [[horsepower]] per cubic inch). The result offers an approximation of the peak power output of an engine. This is not to be confused with [[fuel efficiency]], since high efficiency often requires a lean fuel-air ratio, and thus lower power density. A modern high-performance car engine makes in excess of 75&nbsp;kW/l (1.65&nbsp;hp/in<sup>3</sup>).\n\n==Everyday examples==\nExamples of everyday heat engines include the [[steam engine]] and the [[internal combustion engine]]. The [[stirling engine]] is also heat engine, as well as the [[drinking bird]] toy. All of these heat engines are powered by the expansion of heated gases. The general surroundings are the heat sink, which provides relatively cool gases that, when heated, expand rapidly to drive the mechanical motion of the engine.\n\n==Examples of heat engines==\nIt is important to note that although some cycles have a typical combustion location (internal or external), they often can be implemented with the other. For example, [[John Ericsson]] developed an external heated engine running on a cycle very much like the earlier [[Diesel cycle]]. In addition, externally heated engines can often be implemented in open or closed cycles.\n\n=== Earth's heat engine ===\nEarth's atmosphere and hydrosphere\u2014Earth\u2019s heat engine\u2014are coupled processes that constantly even out solar heating imbalances through evaporation of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation, when distributing heat around the globe.<ref name=\"Lindsey 2009\">{{cite journal\n | last = Lindsey\n | first = Rebecca\n | authorlink =\n | coauthors =\n | year = 2009\n | title = Climate and Earth\u2019s Energy Budget\n | journal = NASA Earth Observatory\n | volume =\n | doi =\n | url = http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/\n | language=\n }}</ref>\n\nThe Hadley system provides an example of a heat engine.

Sinitsyn 2011 JPA ''44''' 405001 --> This relation transforms the Carnot's inequality into exact equality.\n\n==Efficiency==\nThe efficiency of a heat engine relates how much useful work is output for a given amount of heat energy input.\n\nFrom the laws of [[thermodynamics]], after a completed cycle:\n\n:<math> W \\ = \\ Q_c \\ - \\ (-Q_h) </math>\n:where\n:<math> W = -\\oint PdV </math> is the work extracted from the engine. (It is negative since work is ''done by'' the engine.)\n:<math> Q_h = T_h\\Delta S_h </math> is the heat energy taken from the high temperature system. (It is negative since heat is extracted from the source, hence <math>(-Q_h)</math> is positive.)\n:<math> Q_c = T_c\\Delta S_c </math> is the heat energy delivered to the cold temperature system. (It is positive since heat is added to the sink.)\n\nIn other words, a heat engine absorbs heat energy from the high temperature heat source, converting part of it to useful work and delivering the rest to the cold temperature heat sink.\n\nIn general, the efficiency of a given heat transfer process (whether it be a refrigerator, a heat pump or an engine) is defined informally by the ratio of \"what you get out\" to \"what you put in\".\n\nIn the case of an engine, one desires to extract work and puts in a heat transfer.\n\n:<math>\\eta = \\frac{-W}{-Q_h} = \\frac{-Q_h - Q_c}{-Q_h} = 1 - \\frac{Q_c}{-Q_h}</math>\n\nThe ''theoretical'' maximum efficiency of any heat engine depends only on the temperatures it operates between. This efficiency is usually derived using an ideal imaginary heat engine such as the [[Carnot heat engine]], although other engines using different cycles can also attain maximum efficiency. Mathematically, this is because in [[Thermodynamic reversibility|reversible]] processes, the change in [[entropy]] of the cold reservoir is the negative of that of the hot reservoir (i.e., <math>\\Delta S_c = -\\Delta S_h</math>), keeping the overall change of entropy zero. Thus:\n\n:<math>\\eta_\\text{max} = 1 - \\frac{T_c \\Delta S_c}{-T_h \\Delta S_h} = 1 - \\frac{T_c}{T_h}</math>\n\nwhere <math>T_h</math> is the [[absolute temperature]] of the hot source and <math>T_c</math> that of the cold sink, usually measured in [[kelvin]]s. Note that <math>dS_c</math> is positive while <math>dS_h</math> is negative; in any reversible work-extracting process, entropy is overall not increased, but rather is moved from a hot (high-entropy) system to a cold (low-entropy one), decreasing the entropy of the heat source and increasing that of the heat sink.\n\nThe reasoning behind this being the '''maximal''' efficiency goes as follows. It is first assumed that if a more efficient heat engine than a Carnot engine is possible, then it could be driven in reverse as a heat pump. Mathematical analysis can be used to show that this assumed combination would result in a net decrease in [[entropy]]. Since, by the [[second law of thermodynamics]], this is statistically improbable to the point of exclusion, the Carnot efficiency is a theoretical upper bound on the reliable efficiency of ''any'' thermodynamic cycle.\n\nEmpirically, no heat engine has ever been shown to run at a greater efficiency than a Carnot cycle heat engine.\n\nFigure 2 and Figure 3 show variations on Carnot cycle efficiency. Figure 2 indicates how efficiency changes with an increase in the heat addition temperature for a constant compressor inlet temperature. Figure 3 indicates how the efficiency changes with an increase in the heat rejection temperature for a constant turbine inlet temperature.\n\n{| cellpadding=\"2\"  style=\"border:1px solid darkgrey; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n|[[File:Carnot Efficiency.svg|none|thumb|385x385px|Figure 2: Carnot cycle efficiency with changing heat addition temperature.]]\n|[[File:Carnot Efficiency2.svg|none|thumb|450x450px|Figure 3: Carnot cycle efficiency with changing heat rejection temperature.]]\n|}\n\n===Endoreversible heat engines===\nThe most Carnot efficiency as a criterion of heat engine performance is the fact that by its nature, any maximally efficient Carnot cycle must operate at an infinitesimal temperature gradient. This is because ''any'' transfer of heat between two bodies at differing temperatures is irreversible, and therefore the Carnot efficiency expression only applies in the infinitesimal limit. The major problem with that is that the object of most heat engines is to output some sort of power, and infinitesimal power is usually not what is being sought.\n\nA different measure of ideal heat engine efficiency is given by considerations of [[endoreversible thermodynamics]], where the cycle is identical to the Carnot cycle except in that the two processes of heat transfer are ''not'' reversible (Callen 1985):\n\n:<math>\\eta = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{T_c}{T_h}}</math> (Note: Units [[kelvin|K]] or [[Rankine scale|\u00b0R]])\n\nThis model does a better job of predicting how well real-world heat engines can do (Callen 1985, see also [[endoreversible thermodynamics]]):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Efficiencies of power stations'''<ref>F.

They continue to be developed today.\n\n==Heat engine enhancements==\nEngineers have studied the various heat engine cycles extensively in effort to improve the amount of usable work they could extract from a given power source. The Carnot cycle limit cannot be reached with any gas-based cycle, but engineers have worked out at least two ways to possibly go around that limit, and one way to get better efficiency without bending any rules.\n# Increase the temperature difference in the heat engine. The simplest way to do this is to increase the hot side temperature, which is the approach used in modern combined-cycle [[gas turbine]]s. Unfortunately, physical limits (such as the melting point of the materials used to build the engine) and environmental concerns regarding [[NOx|NO<sub>x</sub>]] production restrict the maximum temperature on workable heat engines. Modern gas turbines run at temperatures as high as possible within the range of temperatures necessary to maintain acceptable NO<sub>x</sub> output {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Another way of increasing efficiency is to lower the output temperature. One new method of doing so is to use mixed chemical working fluids, and then exploit the changing behavior of the mixtures. One of the most famous is the so-called [[Kalina cycle]], which uses a 70/30 mix of [[ammonia]] and water as its working fluid. This mixture allows the cycle to generate useful power at considerably lower temperatures than most other processes.\n# Exploit the physical properties of the working fluid. The most common such exploitation is the use of water above the so-called critical point, or so-called supercritical steam. The behavior of fluids above their critical point changes radically, and with materials such as water and [[carbon dioxide]] it is possible to exploit those changes in behavior to extract greater thermodynamic efficiency from the heat engine, even if it is using a fairly conventional Brayton or Rankine cycle. A newer and very promising material for such applications is [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[xenon]] have also been considered for such applications, although SO<sub>2</sub> is toxic.\n# Exploit the chemical properties of the working fluid. A fairly new and novel exploit is to use exotic working fluids with advantageous chemical properties. One such is [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>), a toxic component of smog, which has a natural [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] as di-nitrogen tetraoxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). At low temperature, the N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is compressed and then heated. The increasing temperature causes each N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to break apart into two NO<sub>2</sub> molecules. This lowers the molecular weight of the working fluid, which drastically increases the efficiency of the cycle. Once the NO<sub>2</sub> has expanded through the turbine, it is cooled by the [[heat sink]], which makes it recombine into N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. This is then fed back by the compressor for another cycle. Such species as [[aluminium bromide]] (Al<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>6</sub>), NOCl, and Ga<sub>2</sub>I<sub>6</sub> have all been investigated for such uses. To date, their drawbacks have not warranted their use, despite the efficiency gains that can be realized.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Nuclear%20Reactors%20Concepts%20and%20Thermodynamic%20Cycles.pdf |title=Nuclear Reactors Concepts and Thermodynamic Cycles |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318233007/https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Nuclear%20Reactors%20Concepts%20and%20Thermodynamic%20Cycles.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Heat engine processes==\n{{Table of thermodynamic cycles}}\n\nEach process is one of the following:\n* [[isothermal process|isothermal]] (at constant temperature, maintained with heat added or removed from a heat source or sink)\n* [[isobaric process|isobaric]] (at constant pressure)\n* [[isochoric process|isometric/isochoric]] (at constant volume), also referred to as iso-volumetric\n* [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] (no heat is added or removed from the system during adiabatic process)\n* [[isentropic process|isentropic]] (reversible adiabatic process, no heat is added or removed during isentropic process)\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n* [[Heat pump]]\n* [[Reciprocating engine]] for a general description of the mechanics of piston engines\n* [[Thermosynthesis]]\n* [[Timeline of heat engine technology]]\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Heat engines}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* {{Cite book | last = Kroemer | first = Herbert |author2=Kittel, Charles | title = Thermal Physics | edition = 2nd | publisher = W.
