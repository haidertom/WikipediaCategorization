In its pure form, it is a pale blue, clear [[liquid]], slightly more [[viscosity|viscous]] than [[Properties of water|water]]. Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest [[peroxide]] (a compound with an oxygen\u2013oxygen [[single bond]]). It is used as an [[oxidizer]], [[bleach]]ing agent and [[antiseptic]]. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide, or \"[[high-test peroxide]]\", is a [[reactive oxygen species]] and has been used as a [[propellant]] in [[rocket]]ry.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hill |first=C.

Because of its instability, hydrogen peroxide is typically stored with a stabilizer in a weakly acidic solution. Hydrogen peroxide is found in biological systems including the human body. Enzymes that use or decompose hydrogen peroxide are classified as [[peroxidases]].\n\n== Properties ==\nThe boiling point of {{chem|H|2|O|2}} has been extrapolated as  being 150.2&nbsp;\u00b0C, approximately 50&nbsp;\u00b0C higher than water. In practice, hydrogen peroxide will undergo potentially explosive [[thermal decomposition]] if heated to this temperature.

The boiling point of the same mixtures is also depressed in relation with the mean of both boiling points (125.1&nbsp;\u00b0C). It occurs at 114&nbsp;\u00b0C.

The bleaching effect of peroxides and their salts on [[natural dye]]s became known around that time, but early attempts of industrial production of peroxides failed, and the first plant producing hydrogen peroxide was built in 1873 in [[Berlin]]. The discovery of the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide by [[electrolysis]] with [[sulfuric acid]] introduced the more efficient electrochemical method. It was first implemented into industry in 1908 in [[Wei\u00dfenstein]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], Austria. The [[anthraquinone process]], which is still used, was developed during the 1930s by the German chemical manufacturer [[IG Farben]] in [[Ludwigshafen]]. The increased demand and improvements in the synthesis methods resulted in the rise of the annual production of hydrogen peroxide from 35,000 tonnes in 1950, to over 100,000 tonnes in 1960, to 300,000 tonnes by 1970; by 1998 it reached 2.7 million tonnes.<ref name=offer>\n{{cite journal \n| last1 = Offermanns | first1 = Heribert \n| authorlink = Heribert Offermanns \n| last2 = Dittrich | first2 = Gunther \n| last3 = Steiner | first3 = Norbert | year = 2000 \n| title = Wasserstoffperoxid in Umweltschutz und Synthese \n| url = | journal = Chemie in Unserer Zeit \n| volume = 34 | issue = 3| page = 150 \n|doi=10.1002/1521-3781(200006)34:3<150::AID-CIUZ150>3.0.CO;2-A\n}}\n</ref>\n\nPure hydrogen peroxide was long believed to be unstable, as early attempts to separate it from the water, which is present during synthesis, all failed.

It begins with the reduction of an [[anthraquinone]] (such as [[2-Ethylanthraquinone|2-ethylanthraquinone]] or the 2-amyl derivative) to the corresponding [[anthrahydroquinone]], typically by [[hydrogenation]] on a [[palladium]] [[catalysis|catalyst]]; the anthrahydroquinone then undergoes [[autoxidation]] to regenerate the starting anthraquinone, with hydrogen peroxide as a by-product. Most commercial processes achieve oxidation by bubbling [[compressed air]] through a solution of the derivatized [[anthracene]], whereby the oxygen present in the air reacts with the labile hydrogen atoms (of the hydroxy groups), giving hydrogen peroxide and regenerating the anthraquinone. Hydrogen peroxide is then [[Liquid\u2013liquid extraction|extracted]], and the [[anthraquinone]] derivative is reduced back to the dihydroxy ([[anthracene]]) compound using [[hydrogen]] gas in the presence of a metal catalyst.

Systems for direct synthesis have been developed, most of which are based around finely dispersed metal catalysts.<ref>Noritaka Mizuno Gabriele Centi, Siglinda Perathoner, Salvatore Abate  \"Direct Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide: Recent Advances\"  in ''Modern Heterogeneous Oxidation Catalysis: Design, Reactions and Characterization'' 2009, Wiley-VCH. {{DOI|10.1002/9783527627547.ch8}}</ref><ref name=\"Hutchings\">{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=Jennifer K. |last2=Solsona |first2=\nBenjamin |last3=N |first3=Edwin Ntainjua |last4=Carley |first4=Albert F. |last5=Herzing |first5=Andrew A. |last6=Kiely |first6=Christopher J. |last7=Hutchings |first7=Graham J. |date=20 February 2009 |title=Switching Off Hydrogen Peroxide Hydrogenation in the Direct Synthesis Process |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.1168980 |pmid=19229032 |bibcode=2009Sci...323.1037E |volume=323 |number=5917 |pages=1037\u20131041}}</ref> None of these has yet reached a point where they can be used for industrial-scale synthesis.\n\n[[File:Container JOTU501003 9.jpg|thumb|ISO tank container for hydrogen peroxide transportation]]\n[[File:HydrogenPeroxideTankCarBoltonON.jpg|thumb|A tank car designed for transporting hydrogen peroxide by rail]]\n\n=== Availability ===\nHydrogen peroxide is most commonly available as a solution in water. For consumers, it is usually available from pharmacies at 3 and 6 wt% concentrations. The concentrations are sometimes described in terms of the volume of oxygen gas generated; one milliliter of a 20-volume solution generates twenty milliliters of oxygen gas when completely decomposed. For laboratory use, 30 wt% solutions are most common. Commercial grades from 70% to 98% are also available, but due to the potential of solutions of more than 68% hydrogen peroxide to be converted entirely to steam and oxygen (with the temperature of the steam increasing as the concentration increases above 68%) these grades are potentially far more hazardous and require special care in dedicated storage areas. Buyers must typically allow inspection by commercial manufacturers.\n\nIn 1994, world production of {{chem|H|2|O|2}} was around 1.9 million [[tonne]]s and grew to 2.2 million in 2006,<ref name=HageLienke /> most of which was at a concentration of 70% or less.

Non-metallic catalysts include [[potassium iodide]], which reacts particularly rapidly and forms the basis of the [[elephant toothpaste]] experiment. Hydrogen peroxide can also be decomposed biologically by the [[enzyme]] [[catalase]]. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide liberates oxygen and heat; this can be dangerous, as spilling high-concentration hydrogen peroxide on a flammable substance can cause an immediate fire.\n\n=== Redox reactions ===\nHydrogen peroxide exhibits oxidizing and reducing properties, depending on pH.\n\nIn acidic solutions, {{chem|H|2|O|2}} is one of the most powerful oxidizers known, when used for removing organic stains from laboratory glassware it is referred to as [[Piranha solution]] and is stronger than [[chlorine]], [[chlorine dioxide]], and [[potassium permanganate]]. Also, through catalysis, {{chem|H|2|O|2}} can be converted into [[hydroxyl radical]]s (\u00b7OH), which are highly reactive.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! [[Oxidant]]/reduced product\n!

However, [[potassium permanganate]] is reduced to {{chem|Mn|2+}} by acidic {{chem|H|2|O|2}}. Under [[alkaline]] conditions, however, some of these reactions reverse; for example, {{chem|Mn|2+}} is oxidized to {{chem|Mn|4+}} (as {{chem|link=Manganese(IV) oxide|MnO|2}}).\n\nIn basic solution, hydrogen peroxide can reduce a variety of inorganic ions. When it acts as a reducing agent, [[oxygen]] gas is also produced.  For example, hydrogen peroxide will reduce [[sodium hypochlorite]] and [[potassium permanganate]], which is a convenient method for preparing [[oxygen]] in the laboratory:\n:NaOCl + {{chem|H|2|O|2}} \u2192 {{chem|O|2}} + NaCl + {{chem|H|2|O}}\n:2 {{chem|KMnO|4}} + 3 {{chem|H|2|O|2}} \u2192 2 {{chem|MnO|2}} + 2 KOH + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}} + 3 {{chem|O|2}}\n\n=== Organic reactions ===\nHydrogen peroxide is frequently used as an [[Redox|oxidizing agent]].

It is also the principal reagent in the [[Dakin oxidation]] process.\n\n=== Precursor to other peroxide compounds ===\nHydrogen peroxide is a weak acid, forming [[hydroperoxide]] or [[peroxide]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s with many metals.\n\nIt also converts metal oxides into the corresponding peroxides.  For example, upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide, [[chromic acid]]({{chem|Cr|O|3}} + {{chem|H|2|S|O|4}}) forms an unstable blue peroxide CrO({{chem|O|2}}{{chem|)|2}}.\n\nThis kind of reaction is used industrially to produce peroxoanions.  For example, reaction with [[borax]] leads to [[sodium perborate]], a bleach used in laundry detergents:\n:{{chem|Na|2|B|4|O|7}} + 4 {{chem|H|2|O|2}} + 2 NaOH \u2192 2 {{chem|Na|2|B|2|O|4|(OH)|4}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}\n\n{{chem|H|2|O|2}} converts [[carboxylic acid]]s (RCO<sub>2</sub>H) into peroxy acids (RC(O)O<sub>2</sub>H), which are themselves used as oxidizing agents. Hydrogen peroxide reacts with [[acetone]] to form [[acetone peroxide]] and with [[ozone]] to form [[trioxidane]]. Hydrogen peroxide forms stable [[adduct]]s with urea ([[hydrogen peroxide - urea]]), sodium carbonate ([[sodium percarbonate]]) and other compounds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chernyshov|first=Ivan Yu.|last2=Vener|first2=Mikhail V.|last3=Prikhodchenko|first3=Petr V.|last4=Medvedev|first4=Alexander G.|last5=Lev|first5=Ovadia|last6=Churakov|first6=Andrei V.|date=2017-01-04|title=Peroxosolvates: Formation Criteria, H2O2 Hydrogen Bonding, and Isomorphism with the Corresponding Hydrates|journal=Crystal Growth & Design|volume=17|issue=1|pages=214\u2013220|doi=10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01449|issn=1528-7483}}</ref>  An acid-base adduct with [[triphenylphosphine oxide]] is a useful \"carrier\" for {{chem|H|2|O|2}} in some reactions.\n\nThe peroxide anion is a stronger nucleophile than hydroxide and displaces hydroxyl from oxyanions e.g. forming perborates and percarbonates. [[Sodium perborate]] and [[sodium percarbonate]] are important consumer and industrial bleaching agents; they stabilize hydrogen peroxide and limit side reactions (e.g. reduction and decomposition note below). The peroxide anion forms an adduct with [[urea]], [[hydrogen peroxide - urea|hydrogen peroxide\u2013urea]].\n\nHydrogen peroxide is both an oxidizing agent and reducing agent. The oxidation of hydrogen peroxide by sodium [[hypochlorite]] yields [[singlet oxygen]]. The net reaction of a ferric ion with hydrogen peroxide is a ferrous ion and oxygen. This proceeds via single electron oxidation and hydroxyl radicals. This is used in some organic chemistry oxidations, e.g. in the [[Fenton's reagent]]. Only catalytic quantities of iron ion is needed since peroxide also oxidizes ferrous to ferric ion. The net reaction of hydrogen peroxide and [[permanganate]] or manganese dioxide is manganous ion; however, until the peroxide is spent some manganous ions are reoxidized to make the reaction catalytic. This forms the basis for common [[monopropellant]] rockets.\n\n== Biological function ==\n[[File:Ascaridol.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Ascaridole]]]]\nHydrogen peroxide is formed in human and animals as a short-lived product in biochemical processes and is [[Toxicity|toxic]] to [[Cell (biology)|cells]].

First, that hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced by the body to combat infection; and second, that human [[pathogen]]s (including cancer: See [[Warburg hypothesis]]) are [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] and cannot survive in oxygen-rich environments. The ingestion or injection of hydrogen peroxide is therefore believed to kill disease by mimicking the immune response in addition to increasing levels of oxygen within the body. This makes it similar to other oxygen-based therapies, such as [[ozone therapy]] and [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]].\n\nBoth the effectiveness and safety of hydrogen peroxide therapy is scientifically questionable. Hydrogen peroxide is produced by the immune system but in a carefully controlled manner. Cells called [[phagocyte]]s engulf pathogens and then use hydrogen peroxide to destroy them. The peroxide is toxic to both the cell and the pathogen and so is kept within a special compartment, called a [[phagosome]]. Free hydrogen peroxide will damage any tissue it encounters via [[oxidative stress]]; a process which also has been proposed as a cause of cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Halliwell|first=Barry|title=Oxidative stress and cancer: have we moved forward?|journal=Biochemical Journal|date=1 January 2007|volume=401|issue=1|pages=1\u201311|doi=10.1042/BJ20061131|pmid=17150040}}</ref>\nClaims that hydrogen peroxide therapy increases cellular levels of oxygen have not been supported. The quantities administered would be expected to provide very little additional oxygen compared to that available from normal respiration. It should also be noted that it is difficult to raise the level of oxygen around cancer cells within a tumour, as the blood supply tends to be poor, a situation known as [[tumor hypoxia]].\n\nLarge oral doses of hydrogen peroxide at a 3% concentration may cause irritation and blistering to the mouth, throat, and abdomen as well as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.<ref name=\"largeOral\" />\n[[intravenous therapy|Intravenous injection]] of hydrogen peroxide has been linked to several deaths.<ref name=\"deaths\" /><ref name=\"snopesH2O2\" /><ref name=\"lethalInjection\" />\n\nThe [[American Cancer Society]] states that \"there is no scientific evidence that hydrogen peroxide is a safe, effective or useful cancer treatment.\"<ref name=\"baddrink\" /> Furthermore, the therapy is not approved by the U.S. FDA.\n\n=== Propellant ===\n{{details|High-test peroxide}}\n[[File:Rocket Belt Propulsion.svg|thumb|upright|Rocket-belt hydrogen-peroxide propulsion system used in a [[jet pack]]]]\n\nHigh-concentration {{chem|H|2|O|2}} is referred to as \"high-test peroxide\" (HTP). It can be used either as a [[monopropellant]] (not mixed with fuel) or as the oxidizer component of a [[bipropellant rocket]]. Use as a monopropellant takes advantage of the decomposition of 70\u201398% concentration hydrogen peroxide into steam and oxygen. The propellant is pumped into a reaction chamber, where a catalyst, usually a silver or platinum screen, triggers decomposition, producing steam at over {{convert|600|C}}, which is expelled through a [[nozzle]], generating [[thrust]]. {{chem|H|2|O|2}} monopropellant produces a maximal [[specific impulse]] (''I''<sub>sp</sub>) of 161 s (1.6 [[newton-second|kN\u00b7s]]/kg). Peroxide was the first major monopropellant adopted for use in rocket applications. [[Hydrazine]] eventually replaced hydrogen-peroxide monopropellant thruster applications primarily because of a 25% increase in the vacuum specific impulse.<ref>http://www.hydrogen-peroxide.us/history-US-General-Kinetics/AIAA-2006-5236_hydrogen_peroxide_versus_hydrazine.pdf</ref> Hydrazine (toxic) and hydrogen peroxide (less-toxic [ACGIH TLV 0.01 and 1 ppm respectively]) are the only two monopropellants (other than cold gases) to have been widely adopted and utilized for propulsion and power applications.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The [[Bell Rocket Belt]], [[reaction control system]]s for [[Bell X-1|X-1]], [[X-15]], [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]], [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Little Joe (rocket)|Little Joe]], as well as the turbo-pump gas generators for X-1, X-15, Jupiter, Redstone and Viking used hydrogen peroxide as a monopropellant.<ref>http://www.hydrogen-peroxide.us/uses-monoprop-steam-generation/AIAA-1999-2880_The_Use_of_Hydrogen_Peroxide_for_Propulsion_and_Power-pitch.pdf</ref>\n\nAs a bipropellant, {{chem|H|2|O|2}} is decomposed to burn a fuel as an oxidizer. Specific impulses as high as 350 s (3.5&nbsp;kN\u00b7s/kg) can be achieved, depending on the fuel. Peroxide used as an oxidizer gives a somewhat lower ''I''<sub>sp</sub> than liquid oxygen, but is dense, storable, noncryogenic and can be more easily used to drive gas turbines to give high pressures using an efficient ''closed cycle''. It can also be used for regenerative cooling of rocket engines. Peroxide was used very successfully as an oxidizer in World War II German rocket motors (e.g. [[T-Stoff]], containing oxyquinoline stabilizer, for both the [[Walter HWK 109-500]] ''Starthilfe'' [[RATO]] externally podded monopropellant booster system, and for the [[Walter HWK 109-509]] rocket motor series used for the [[Me 163]]B), most often used with [[C-Stoff]] in a self-igniting [[hypergolic]] combination, and for the low-cost British [[Black Knight (rocket)|Black Knight]] and [[Black Arrow]] launchers. <!--{{cite web\n| url = http://www.cue-dih.co.uk/aerospace/aeropdfs/htp_for_prop.pdf\n| title = Hydrogen Peroxide for Power and Propulsion}}-->\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, the [[Hellmuth Walter Kommanditgesellschaft|Hellmuth Walter KG]]-conceived [[gas turbine|turbine]] used hydrogen peroxide for use in [[submarine]]s while submerged; it was found to be too noisy and require too much maintenance compared to [[Submarine#Propulsion|diesel-electric]] power systems.

Most over-the-counter peroxide solutions are not suitable for ingestion. Higher concentrations may be considered hazardous and are typically accompanied by a [[Material Safety Data Sheet]] (MSDS). In high concentrations, hydrogen peroxide is an aggressive oxidizer and will corrode many materials, including human skin. In the presence of a [[reducing agent]], high concentrations of {{chem|H|2|O|2}} will react violently.\n\nHigh-concentration hydrogen peroxide streams, typically above 40%, should be considered hazardous due to concentrated hydrogen peroxide's meeting the definition of a [[United States Department of Transportation|DOT]] oxidizer according to U.S. regulations, if released into the environment. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] Reportable Quantity (RQ) for D001 hazardous wastes is {{convert|100|lb|kg}}, or approximately {{convert|10|USgal|L}}, of concentrated hydrogen peroxide.\n\nHydrogen peroxide should be stored in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area and away from any flammable or combustible substances. It should be stored in a container composed of non-reactive materials such as stainless steel or glass (other materials including some plastics and aluminium alloys may also be suitable).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozoneservices.com/articles/004.htm|title=Material Compatibility with Hydrogen Peroxide|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2016}}</ref> Because it breaks down quickly when exposed to light, it should be stored in an opaque container, and pharmaceutical formulations typically come in brown bottles that block light.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.hydrogenperoxidemouthwash.org |title = Hydrogen Peroxide Mouthwash is it Safe? |accessdate = 30 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nHydrogen peroxide, either in pure or diluted form, can pose several risks, the main one being that it forms explosive mixtures upon contact with organic compounds.<ref name=\"osha safety guidelines\" /> Highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide itself is unstable and can cause a [[boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion]] (BLEVE) of the remaining liquid.

According to the entries in Lampe's ''A Patristic Greek Lexicon'', the basic terms ''hesychia'' and ''hesychazo'' appear as early as the 4th century in such fathers as St [[John Chrysostom]] and the [[Cappadocian Fathers|Cappadocians]]. The terms also appear in the same period in [[Evagrius Pontikos]] (c. 345 \u2013 399), who although he is writing in Egypt is out of the circle of the Cappadocians, and in the ''[[Sayings of the Desert Fathers]].''\n\nThe term ''hesychast'' is used sparingly in Christian [[ascetical]] writings emanating from [[Egypt]] from the 4th century on, although the writings of Evagrius and the ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'' do attest to it. In Egypt, the terms more often used are ''anchoretism'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}, \"withdrawal, retreat\"), and ''[[anchorite]]'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}}, \"one who withdraws or retreats, i.e. a hermit\").\n\nThe term ''hesychast'' was used in the 6th century in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the ''Lives'' of [[Cyril of Scythopolis]], many of which lives treat of hesychasts who were contemporaries of Cyril. Here, it should be noted that several of the saints about whom Cyril was writing, especially Euthymios and Savas, were in fact from [[Cappadocia]]. The laws ''(novellae)'' of the emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565) treat ''hesychast'' and ''anchorite'' as synonyms, making them interchangeable terms.\n\nThe terms ''hesychia'' and ''hesychast'' are used quite systematically in the ''[[Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' of [[St John of Sinai]] (523\u2013603) and in ''Pros Theodoulon'' by St Hesychios (c. 750?), who is ordinarily also considered to be of the School of [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]]. It is not known where either St John of Sinai or St Hesychios were born, nor where they received their monastic formation.\n\nIt appears that the particularity of the term ''hesychast'' has to do with the integration of the continual repetition of the [[Jesus Prayer]] into the practices of mental ascesis that were already used by hermits in Egypt.  ''Hesychasm'' itself is not recorded in Lampe's Lexicon, which indicates that it is a later usage, and the term ''Jesus Prayer'' is not found in any of the fathers of the church.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.00.en.some_underlying_positions_of_this_website.htm | first =John S. | last = Romanides | title = Some Underlying Positions of This Website | at = 11, note |publisher=Romanity |accessdate= 2014-02-06}}</ref> Saint [[John Cassian]] (c. 360 \u2013 435) presents as the formula used in Egypt for repetitive prayer, not the Jesus Prayer, but \"O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/350810.htm | first = John | last = Cassian | title = Conferences | number = 10 | chapter = 10\u201311 |publisher= New advent |accessdate = 2014-02-06 | series = Fathers}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | type = transcript | place = [[Canada | CA]] | format = [[Portable document format |PDF]] |url= http://www.meditatio.ca/Transcripts/Meditatio%20Talks%20Series%20D%202005.pdf |title= Talk | first = Laurence | last = Freeman | year = 1992 |publisher= Meditatio |accessdate= 2014-02-06}}</ref>\n\nBy the 14th century, however, on [[Mount Athos]] the terms ''hesychasm'' and ''hesychast'' refer to the practice and to the practitioner of a method of mental ascesis that involves the use of the Jesus Prayer assisted by certain psychophysical techniques. Most likely, the rise of the term ''hesychasm'' reflects the coming to the fore of this practice as something concrete and specific that can be discussed.\n\nBooks used by the hesychast include the ''[[Philokalia]]'', a collection of texts on prayer and solitary mental ascesis written from the 4th to the 15th centuries, which exists in a number of independent redactions; the ''[[Ladder of Divine Ascent]];'' the collected works of [[St Symeon the New Theologian]] (949\u20131022); and the works of [[Isaac of Nineveh|St Isaac the Syrian]] (7th century), as they were selected and translated into Greek at the [[Mar Saba|Monastery of St Savas]] near [[Jerusalem]] about the 10th century.\n\n==Origins==\n\n===Platonism===\nHesychastic practice involves acquiring an inner focus and blocking of the physical senses. In this, hesychasm shows its roots in [[Evagrius Ponticus]] and even in the Greek tradition of asceticism going back to [[Plato]].\n\n===Jewish Merkabah mysticism===\nAccording to some of the adepts of the Jewish [[Merkabah]] mystical tradition, if one wished to \"descend to the Merkabah\" one had to adopt the prayer posture taken by the prophet [[Elijah]] in I Kings 18:42, namely to pray with one's head between one's knees. This is the same prayer posture used by the Christian hesychasts and is the reason that they were mocked by their opponents as \"navel gazers\" ([[Omphaloskepsis|omphalopsychites]]). This bodily position and the practice of rhythmically breathing while invoking a divine name seems to be common to both Jewish Merkabah mysticism and Christian hesychasm. Thus the practice may have origins in the ascetical practices of the biblical prophets.\n\nAlan Segal in his book ''Paul the Convert'' suggests that the Apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] may have been an early adept of Merkabah mysticism in which case what was novel to Paul's experience of divine light on the [[Conversion of Paul|road to Damascus]] was not the experience of divine light itself, but that the source of this divine light identified himself as the Jesus whose followers Paul was persecuting. [[Daniel Boyarin]] notes that Paul's own account of this experience would therefore be the earliest first person account of the mystical vision of a Merkabah adept.\n\n===Gospel-interpretation===\nThe hesychast interprets Jesus's injunction in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] to \"go into your closet to pray\" to mean that one should ignore the senses and withdraw inward. Saint [[John of Sinai]] writes:  \n{{quote|Hesychasm is the enclosing of the bodiless primary cognitive faculty of the soul (Orthodoxy teaches of two cognitive faculties, the [[nous]] and [[logos]]) in the bodily house of the body.<ref>''Ladder'', Step 27, 5, (Step 27, 6 in the Holy Transfiguration edition).</ref>}}\n\n==Practice==\n{{See also|Theoria}}\n\n===Stages===\n{{See also|State (theology)}}\n\n''Theosis'' is obtained by engaging in contemplative prayer resulting from the cultivation of watchfulness (Gk: ''[[nepsis]]''). According to the standard ascetic formulation of this process, there are three stages: \n* ''Katharsis'' or [[purgative way|purification]], \n* ''Theoria'' or [[illuminative way|illumination]], and \n* ''Theosis'' or [[deification]] (also referred to as [[unitive way|union with God]]).{{refn|group=note|name=\"purification for love\"|Purification, and illumination of the noetic faculty, prepare for the vision of God. Without this it is impossible for man's selfish love to be transformed into selfless love. This transformation takes place during the higher level of the stage of illumination called theoria, literally meaning vision, in this case vision ''by means of unceasing and uninterrupted memory of God''. Those who remain selfish and self-centered with a hardened heart, closed to God's love, will not see the glory of God in this life. However, they will see God's glory eventually, but as an eternal and consuming fire and outer darkness. From FRANKS, ROMANS, FEUDALISM, AND DOCTRINE/Diagnosis and Therapy Father [[John S. Romanides]] Diagnosis and Therapy <ref>[http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.03.en.franks_romans_feudalism_and_doctrine.02.htm#s8]</ref>}}\n\n===Katharsis (purification)===\nSobriety contributes to this mental ascesis that rejects tempting thoughts; it puts a great emphasis on focus and attention. The hesychast is to pay extreme attention to the consciousness of his inner world and to the words of the Jesus Prayer, not letting his mind wander in any way at all. While he maintains his practice of the Jesus Prayer, which becomes automatic and continues twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, the hesychast cultivates ''[[nepsis]]'', watchful attention, to reject tempting thoughts (the \"thieves\") that come to the hesychast as he watches in sober attention in his hermitage. St John of Sinai describes hesychast practice as follows:\n{{quote|Take up your seat on a high place and watch, if only you know how, and then you will see in what manner, when, whence, how many and what kind of thieves come to enter and steal your clusters of grapes. When the watchman grows weary, he stands up and prays; and then he sits down again and courageously takes up his former task.<ref>St John of Sinai, Step 27, 21 of the ''Ladder'' (Step 27, 22\u20133 of the Holy Transfiguration edition)</ref>}}\n\nThe hesychast is to attach [[Eros]] (Gr. ''eros)'', that is, \"yearning\", to his practice of sobriety so as to overcome the temptation to [[acedia]] (sloth). He is also to use an extremely directed and controlled anger against the tempting thoughts, although to obliterate them entirely he is to invoke Jesus Christ via the Jesus Prayer.\n\nMuch of the literature of hesychasm is occupied with the psychological analysis of such tempting thoughts (e.g. [[St Mark the Ascetic]]). This psychological analysis owes much to the ascetical works of Evagrius Pontikos, with its doctrine of the eight passions.\n\n===Theoria (illumination)===\n[[Image:Megaloschema.svg|thumb|left|upright|The Great Schema or Megaloschema, worn by seasoned hesychasts]]\n\nThe primary task of the hesychast is to engage in mental ascesis. The hesychast is to bring his mind (Gr. ''[[nous]])'' into his heart so as to practise both the Jesus Prayer and sobriety with his mind in his heart. In solitude and retirement, the hesychast repeats the [[Jesus Prayer]], ''\"Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on me, the sinner.\"'' The hesychast prays the Jesus Prayer 'with the heart'\u2014with meaning, with intent, \"for real\" (see [[ontic]]). He never treats the Jesus Prayer as a string of syllables whose \"surface\" or overt verbal meaning is secondary or unimportant. He considers bare repetition of the Jesus Prayer as a mere string of syllables, perhaps with a \"mystical\" inner meaning beyond the overt verbal meaning, to be worthless or even dangerous. This emphasis on the actual, real invocation of Jesus Christ mirrors an Eastern understanding of mantra in that physical action/voice and meaning are utterly inseparable.\n\nThe descent of the mind into the heart is taken quite literally by the practitioners of hesychasm and is not at all considered to be a metaphorical expression. Some of the psychophysical techniques described in the texts are to assist the descent of the mind into the heart at those times that only with difficulty it descends on its own.\n\nThe goal at this stage is a practice of the Jesus Prayer with the mind in the heart, which practice is free of images (see ''Pros Theodoulon).'' By the exercise of sobriety (the mental ascesis against tempting thoughts), the hesychast arrives at a continual practice of the Jesus Prayer with his mind in his heart and where his consciousness is no longer encumbered by the spontaneous inception of images: his mind has a certain stillness and emptiness that is punctuated only by the eternal repetition of the Jesus Prayer.\n\nThis stage is called the ''guard of the mind.'' This is a very advanced stage of ascetical and spiritual practice, and attempting to accomplish this prematurely, especially with psychophysical techniques, can cause very serious spiritual and emotional harm to the would-be hesychast. St [[Theophan the Recluse]] once remarked that bodily postures and breathing techniques were virtually forbidden in his youth, since, instead of gaining the Spirit of God, people succeeded only \"in ruining their lungs.\"\n\nThe guard of the mind is the practical goal of the hesychast. It is the condition in which he remains as a matter of course throughout his day, every day until he dies.\n\nThere is a very great emphasis on humility in the practice of the Jesus Prayer, great cautions being given in the texts about the disaster that will befall the would-be hesychast if he proceeds in pride, arrogance or conceit. It is also assumed in the hesychast texts that the hesychast is a member of the Orthodox Church in good standing.\n\n===Theosis (deification)===\nIt is from the guard of the mind that he is raised to contemplation by the grace of God.\n\nThe hesychast usually experiences the contemplation of God as light, the \"uncreated light\" of the theology of St Gregory Palamas. The hesychast, when he has by the mercy of God been granted such an experience, does not remain in that experience for a very long time (there are exceptions\u2014see for example the ''Life'' of St Savas the Fool for Christ (14th century), written by [[Philotheus I of Constantinople|St Philotheos Kokkinos]] (14th century)), but he returns \"to earth\" and continues to practise the guard of the mind.\n\nThe uncreated light that the hesychast experiences is identified with the Holy Spirit. Experiences of the uncreated light are allied to the 'acquisition of the Holy Spirit'. Notable accounts of encounters with the Holy Spirit in this fashion are found in St Symeon the New Theologian's account of the illumination of \"George\" (considered a pseudonym of St Symeon himself); in the \"conversation with Motovilov\" in the ''Life'' of [[St Seraphim of Sarov]] (1759\u20131833); and, more recently, in the reminiscences of [[Starets|Elder]] [[Porphyrios (Bairaktaris) of Kafsokalivia]] (''Wounded by Love'' pp.&nbsp;27 \u2013 31).\n\n==Integration in Orthodox Church life==\nHesychasts are fully integrated into the liturgical and [[sacraments|sacramental]] life of the Orthodox Church, including the daily cycle of liturgical prayer of the [[Canonical hours|Divine Office]] and the [[Divine Liturgy]]. However, hesychasts who are living as hermits might have a very rare attendance at the Divine Liturgy (see the life of [[Saint Seraphim of Sarov]]) and might not recite the Divine Office except by means of the Jesus Prayer (attested practice on Mt Athos). In general, the hesychast restricts his external activities for the sake of his hesychastic practice.\n\nOrthodox tradition warns against seeking [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] as an end in itself. Hesychasm is a traditional complex of ascetical practices embedded in the doctrine and practice of the Orthodox Church and intended to purify the member of the Orthodox Church and to make him ready for an encounter with God that comes to him when and if God wants, through God's grace. The goal is to acquire, through purification and grace, the Holy Spirit and salvation. Any ecstatic states or other unusual phenomena which may occur in the course of hesychast practice are considered secondary and unimportant, even quite dangerous. Moreover, seeking after unusual \"spiritual\" experiences can itself cause great harm, ruining the soul and the mind of the seeker. Such a seeking after \"spiritual\" experiences can lead to [[Prelest|''spiritual delusion'']] (Ru. ''prelest,'' Gr. ''plani)''\u2014the antonym of sobriety\u2014in which a person believes himself or herself to be a saint, has hallucinations in which he or she \"sees\" angels, Christ, etc. This state of spiritual delusion is in a superficial, egotistical way pleasurable, but can lead to madness and suicide, and, according to the hesychast fathers, makes salvation impossible.\n\nMount Athos is a center of the practice of hesychasm. St [[Paisius Velichkovsky]] and his disciples [[starets|made the practice known]] in [[Russia]] and [[Romania]], although hesychasm was already previously known in Russia, as is attested by [[St Seraphim of Sarov]]'s independent practice of it.\n\n==Hesychast controversy==\n{{main article|Hesychast controversy}}\n[[Image:Gregor Palamas.jpg|thumb|upright|Gregory Palamas]]\nAbout the year 1337, hesychasm attracted the attention of a learned member of the Orthodox Church, [[Barlaam of Calabria|Barlaam]], a Calabrian monk who at that time held the office of abbot in the Monastery of [[Chora Church|St Saviour]] in Constantinople and who visited Mount Athos. Mount Athos was then at the height of its fame and influence, under the reign of [[Andronicus III Palaeologus]] and under the leadership of the ''Protos'' Symeon. On Mount Athos, Barlaam encountered hesychasts and heard descriptions of their practices, also reading the writings of the teacher in hesychasm of St [[Gregory Palamas]], himself an Athonite monk. Trained in Western [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] theology, Barlaam was scandalized by hesychasm and began to combat it both orally and in his writings. As a private teacher of theology in the Western Scholastic mode, Barlaam propounded a more intellectual and propositional approach to the knowledge of God than the hesychasts taught.\n\nBarlaam took exception to the doctrine entertained by the hesychasts as to the nature of the light, the experience of which was said to be the goal of hesychast practice, regarding it as [[Christian heresy|heretical]] and [[blasphemy|blasphemous]]. It was maintained by the hesychasts to be of divine origin and to be identical to [[Tabor Light|the light]] which had been manifested to Jesus' disciples on [[Mount Tabor, Israel|Mount Tabor]] at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].<ref>Parry (1999), p. 231</ref> This Barlaam held to be [[Polytheism|polytheistic]], inasmuch as it postulated two eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God.\n\nOn the hesychast side, the controversy was taken up by St [[Gregory Palamas]], afterwards Archbishop of [[Thessalonica]], who was asked by his fellow monks on Mt Athos to defend hesychasm from the attacks of Barlaam. St Gregory himself was well-educated in Greek philosophy. St Gregory defended hesychasm in the 1340s at three different synods in [[Constantinople]], and he also wrote a number of works in its defense.\n\nIn these works, St Gregory Palamas uses a distinction, already found in the 4th century in the works of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]], between the energies or operations (Gr. ''energeies)'' of God and the essence of God. St Gregory taught that the [[Essence-Energies distinction|energies or operations of God were uncreated]]. He taught that the essence of God can never be known by his creature even in the next life, but that his uncreated energies or operations can be known both in this life and in the next, and convey to the hesychast in this life and to the righteous in the next life a true spiritual knowledge of God. In Palamite theology, it is the uncreated energies of God that illumine the hesychast who has been vouchsafed an experience of the uncreated light.\n\nIn 1341, the dispute came before a [[synod]] held at [[Constantinople]] and presided over by the Emperor Andronicus III; the synod, taking into account the regard in which the writings of the [[pseudo-Dionysius]] were held, condemned Barlaam, who recanted and returned to Calabria, afterwards becoming a bishop in the [[Catholic Church]].\n\nOne of Barlaam's friends, [[Gregory Akindynos]], who originally was also a friend of St Gregory Palamas, took up the controversy, which also played a role in the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341\u20131347|civil war]] between the supporters of John Cantacuzenus and [[John V Palaiologos]]. Three other synods on the subject were held, at the second of which the followers of Barlaam gained a brief victory. But in 1351 at a synod under the presidency of the Emperor [[John VI Cantacuzenus]], hesychast doctrine was established as the doctrine of the Orthodox Church.\n\n==Roman Catholic opinions of hesychasm==\n[[John Cassian|St. John Cassian]] is not represented in the ''Philokalia'' except by two brief extracts, but this is most likely due to his having written in Latin. His works ''(Coenobitical Institutions'' and the ''Conferences)'' represent a transmittal of Evagrius Pontikos' ascetical doctrines to the West. These works formed the basis of much of the spirituality of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] and its offshoots. Hence, the tradition of St John Cassian in the West concerning the spiritual practice of the hermit can be considered to be a tradition that is parallel to that of hesychasm in the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nWhile Constantinople experienced a succession of councils alternately approving and condemning doctrine concerning hesychasm considered as identified with [[Palamism]] (the last of the five senses in which, according to Kallistos Ware, the term is used), the Western Church held no council in which to make a pronouncement on the issue, and the word \"hesychasm\" does not appear in the [[Denzinger|''Enchiridion Symbolorum et Definitionum'' (Handbook of Creeds and Definitions)]], the collection of Roman Catholic teachings originally compiled by [[Heinrich Joseph Dominicus Denzinger]].\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has thus never expressed any condemnation of Palamism, and uses in its [[liturgy]] readings from the work of [[Nicholas Kabasilas]], a supporter of Palamas in the controversy that took place in the East. Its [[Liturgy of the Hours]] includes extracts from Kabasilas's ''Life in Christ'' on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of the Fifth Week of Easter in Year II of the two-year cycle for the Office of Readings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercaba.org/HORAS%20BIENAL/TIEMPOS/Par/PAS_PAR_05.htm|title=DOMINGO V DE PASCUA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWestern theologians have tended to reject hesychasm, in some instances equating it with [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|quietism]], perhaps because \"quietism\" is the literal translation of \"hesychasm\". However, according to [[Kallistos Ware]], \"To translate \"hesychasm\" as \"quietism\", while perhaps etymologically defensible, is historically and theologically misleading.\" Ware asserts that \"the distinctive tenets of the 17th-century Western quietists is not characteristic of Greek hesychasm.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Spirituality |first=Gordon S. |last=Wakefield |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=1983 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga815P6vxygC&pg=PA190&dq=hesychasm+quietism#v=onepage&q=hesychasm%20quietism&f=false |isbn=978-0-664-22170-6}}</ref> Elsewhere too, Ware argues that it is important not to translate \"hesychasm\" as \"quietism\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The inner kingdom |first=Kallistos |last=Ware |publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=2000 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g8qaOmtq6xoC&pg=PA102&dq=hesychasm+quietism#v=onepage&q=hesychasm%20quietism&f=false |isbn=978-0-88141-209-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Paths to the heart: Sufism and the Christian East |first=James S. |last=Cutsinger |publisher=World Wisdom, Inc |year=2002 |page=261 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wcEQdkvt3EC&pg=PA261&dq=hesychasm+quietism#v=onepage&q=hesychasm%20quietism&f=false |isbn=978-0-941532-43-3}}</ref>\n\nThese theologians generally rejected the contention that, in the case of God, the distinction between essence and energies is real rather than, albeit with a foundation in reality, notional (in the mind).

These monstrous errors were denounced by the Calabrian Barlaam, by Nicephorus Gregoras, and by Acthyndinus. The conflict began in 1338 and ended only in 1368, with the solemn canonization of Palamas and the official recognition of his heresies.

Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society, 1785\u20131847'' (Philadelphia: [[University of Pennsylvania]] Press, 1965), p. 17\u201318.</ref> Rapp and his group of believers began meeting in Iptengen and eventually emigrated to the United States, where they established three communities: [[Harmony, Pennsylvania|Harmony]], [[Butler County, Pennsylvania|Butler County]], [[Pennsylvania]]; [[New Harmony, Indiana|Harmony (later named New Harmony)]], [[Posey County, Indiana|Posey County]], [[Indiana]]; and [[Old Economy Village|Economy]], [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania]].\n\nRapp became inspired by the philosophies of [[Jakob B\u00f6hme]], [[Philipp Jakob Spener]], [[Johann Heinrich Jung]], and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], among others, and later wrote ''Thoughts on the Destiny of Man'', published in German in 1824 and in English a year later, in which he outlined his ideas and philosophy.<ref>John Archibald Bole, ''The Harmony Society: A Chapter in German American Culture History'' (Philadelphia: Americana Germanica Press, 1904) p. 45, 65.</ref> Rapp lived out his remaining days in [[Old Economy Village|Economy]], where he died on August 7, 1847, at the age of 89.<ref>Karl J.

Despite warnings from local authorities, the group continued to meet privately and attract even more followers.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 30.</ref>\n\nBy 1798 Rapp and his group of followers had already begun to distance themselves from mainstream society and intended to establish a new religious congregation of fellow believers. In the Lomersheimer declaration, written in 1798, these religious Separatists presented their statement of faith, based on Christian principles, to the Wurttemberg legislature.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 35.</ref> Rapp's followers declared their desire to form a separate congregation who would meet in members' homes, free from Lutheran Church doctrines. The group supported the belief that baptism was not necessary until children could decide for themselves whether they wanted to become a Christian. They also believed that confirmation for youth was not necessary and communion and confession would only be held a few times a year. Although the Separatists supported civil government, the group refused to make a physical oath in its support, \"for according to the Gospel not oath is allowed him who gives evidence of a righteous life as an upright man.\"<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 39.</ref> They also refused to serve in the military or attend [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] schools, choosing instead to teach their children at home.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 38\u201339.</ref> This declaration of faith, along with some later additions, guided the Harmony Society's religious beliefs even after they had emigrated from Germany to the United States.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 40.</ref>\n\nIn the 1790s, Rapp's followers continued to increase, reaching as many as 10,000 to 12, 000 members.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 46.</ref> The increasing numbers, which included followers outside of Rapp's village, continued to concern the government, who feared they might become rebellious and dangerous to the state.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 49.</ref> Although no severe actions were initially taken to repress the Separatists, the group began to consider emigration to France or the United States. In 1803, when the government began to persecute Rapp's followers, he decided to move the entire group to the [[United States]]. Rapp and a small group of men left Iptingen in 1803 and traveled to America to find a new home.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 49\u201350.</ref> On May 1, 1804, the first group of emigrants departed for the United States. The initial move scattered the followers and reduced Rapp's original group of 12,000 to just a few followers. Johan Frederich Reichert, who later agreed to become Rapp's adopted son and took the name of Frederick Reichert Rapp, reported in a letter dated February 25, 1804, that there were \"at least 100 families or 500 persons actually ready to go\" even if they had to sacrifice their property.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 54.</ref>\n\n==Settlements in the United States==\nIn 1804, while Rapp and his associates remained in the United States looking for a place to settle, his followers sailed to America aboard several vessels and made their way to western [[Pennsylvania]], where they waited until land had been selected for their new settlement.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 65\u201369.</ref> Rapp was able to secure a large tract of land in [[Pennsylvania]] and started his first [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], known as Harmonie or [[Harmony, Pennsylvania|Harmony]], in [[Butler County, Pennsylvania]],<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 72.</ref> where the Society existed from 1804 to 1815.<ref name=beginnings189>Karl J.

Ten years later, the town was sold and the Harmonists moved westward to the [[Indiana Territory]], where they established the town of Harmony, now called [[New Harmony, Indiana]], and remained there from 1815 to 1825.<ref name=beginnings189/> The Indiana settlement was sold to [[Robert Owen]] and was renamed [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]].

Members contributed all of their possessions, pledged cooperation in promoting the interests of the group, and agreed to accept no pay for their services. In return, the members would receive care as long as they lived with the group. Under this agreement, if a member left the Society, their funds would be returned without interest or, if they had not contributed to the Society's treasury, they would receive a small monetary gift.<ref name=Bole3334>Bole, p. 33\u201334.</ref>\n\nThe Society was a religious congregation who submitted to spiritual and material leadership under Rapp and his associates and worked together for the common good of all its members.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 75.</ref> Believing that the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]] would occur during their lifetimes, the Harmonists contented to live simply under a strict religious doctrine, gave up tobacco, and advocated celibacy.<ref name=engineers/>\n\n===First settlement: Harmony, Pennsylvania===\n[[Image:HarmonyPAmuseum.jpg|thumb|Harmony Society building in [[Harmony, Pennsylvania]], built in 1809.]]\n{{main|Harmony, Pennsylvania}}\n\nIn December 1804 Rapp and a party of two others initially contracted to purchase {{convert|4,500|acre|km2}} of land for $11,250 in [[Butler County, Pennsylvania]],<ref>William E.

In January 1806 Rapp traveled to Washington, D.C. to hear discussions in Congress regarding the Harmonists' petition for a grant that would allow them to purchase approximately {{convert|30,000|acre|km2}} acre of land in the Indiana Territory. While the Senate passed the petition on January 29, it was defeated in the House of Representatives on February 18.

(The town's name was changed to [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] after the Harmonists left in 1824.) The Harmonists entered into agriculture and manufacture on a larger scale than they had done in Pennsylvania. When the Harmonists advertised their [[Indiana]] property for sale in 1824, they had acquired {{convert|20,000|acre|km2}} of land, {{convert|2,000|acre|km2}} of which was under cultivation.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 295.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer and fall of 1814, many Harmonists fell sick from fever ([[malaria]]) and work on the new town nearly ceased.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 147.</ref> During this time the Society lost about 120 people and others fell ill until conditions were improved and the swamps around the area were drained.<ref name=usi /> Despite these illnesses, construction of the new town continued. By 1819 the Harmonites had built 150 log homes, a church, a community storehouse, barns, stables, and a tavern, along with thriving shops and mills, and cleared land for farming.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 206\u2013207.</ref> As the new settlement in Indiana grew, it also began to attract new arrivals, including emigrants from Germany, who expected the Harmonists to pay for their passage to America.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 182\u2013198.</ref>\n\nVisitors to the new town commented on its growing commercial and industrial work.

Of 750 members, 250 became alienated through the influence of [[Bernhard M\u00fcller]] (self-styled Count de Leon), who, with 40 followers (also at variance with the authorities in [[Europe|the old country]]), had come to [[Old Economy Village|Economy]] to affiliate with the Society. Rapp and [[Bernhard M\u00fcller|Leon]] could not agree; a separation and apportionment of the property were therefore agreed upon. This secession of one-third of the Society, which consisted mostly of the flower of young manhood and young womanhood who did not want to maintain the custom of [[celibacy]], broke Frederick's heart. He died within two years. It resulted in a considerable fracturing of the community. Nevertheless, the Society remained prosperous in business investments for many more years to come.\n\nAfter Frederick Rapp's death in 1834, George Rapp appointed Romelius Baker and Jacob Henrici as trustees to manage the Society's business affairs.<ref>Daniel B.

In 1807, [[celibacy]] was advocated as the preferred custom of the community in an attempt to purify themselves for the coming [[Millennialism|Millennium]]. Rapp believed that the events and wars going on in the world at the time were a confirmation of his views regarding the imminent [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]], and he also viewed [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] as the [[Antichrist]].<ref name=\"Baumgartner\">Frederic J. Baumgartner, ''Longing for the End: A History of Millennialism in Western Civilization'' (1999) p. 166.</ref> In 1814, the Society sold their first town in Pennsylvania and moved to the [[Indiana Territory]], where they built their second town. In 1824, they decided it was time to leave Indiana, sold their land and town in Indiana, and moved to their final settlement in [[Western Pennsylvania]].\n\n[[Image:Sophia design.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Sophia (wisdom)|Virgin Sophia]] design on doorway in [[Harmony, Pennsylvania]], carved by Frederick Reichert Rapp (1775\u20131834).]]\n\nThe Harmonites were [[Millennialism|Millennialists]], in that they believed [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] was coming to earth in their lifetime to help usher in a thousand-year kingdom of peace on earth. This is perhaps why they believed that people should try to make themselves \"pure\" and \"perfect\", and share things with others while willingly living in [[Commune (intentional community)|communal]] \"harmony\" ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] [[Christian communism#Biblical citations|4:32-35]]) and practicing [[celibacy]]. They believed that the old ways of life on earth were coming to an end, and that a new perfect kingdom on earth was about to be realized.\n\nThey also practiced forms of [[Esoteric Christianity]], [[Mysticism]] ([[Christian mysticism]]), and Rapp often spoke of the [[Virginity|virgin]] [[spirit]] or [[Goddess#Christianity|Goddess]] named [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] in his writings.<ref name=\"Versluis\">Arthur Versluis, \"Western Esotericism and The Harmony Society\", ''Esoterica I'' (1999) p. 20\u201347. [http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/Versluis.html Michigan State University]</ref> Rapp was very influenced by the writings of [[Jakob B\u00f6hme]],<ref name =\"Versluis\"/> [[Philipp Jakob Spener]], and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], among others. Also, at [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania|Economy]], there are glass bottles and literature that seem to indicate that the group was interested in (and practiced) [[alchemy]].<ref name =\"Versluis\"/> Other books found in the Harmony Society's library in Economy, include those by the following authors: [[Christoph Sch\u00fctz]], [[Gottfried Arnold]], [[Justinus Kerner]], [[Thomas Bromley (1629\u20131691)|Thomas Bromley]],<ref>{{cite web | author = PasstheWORD | title = Thomas Bromley On-Line Manuscripts | publisher = PasstheWORD  | date = 2005-10-13 | url =http://www.passtheword.org/Thomas-Bromley/ | accessdate = 2012-06-15}}</ref> [[Jane Leade]], [[Johann Scheible]] (''[[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]''),<ref>{{cite web\n | author = Joseph H.

In March 1832, one third of the group left the Society and some began following [[Bernhard M\u00fcller]], who claimed to be the [[Lion of Judah#Lion of Judah in Christianity|Lion of Judah]]. Nevertheless, most of the group stayed and Rapp continued to lead them until he died on August 7, 1847. His last words to his followers were, \"If I did not so fully believe, that the Lord has designated me to place our society before His presence in the land of Canaan, I would consider this my last\".<ref>Wilson, p. 11.</ref>\n\nThe Harmonites did not mark their [[Grave (burial)|graves]] with [[headstone]]s or grave markers, because they thought it was unnecessary to do so; however, one exception is George Rapp's son Johannes' stone marker in Harmony, Pennsylvania, which was installed by non-Harmonites many years after the Harmonites left that town.<ref>Arndt, ''George Rapp's Successors and Material Heirs'', p. 157.</ref> Today, Harmonist [[graveyard]]s are fenced in grassy areas with signs posted nearby explaining this practice.\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe Harmony Society's architecture reflected their [[Swabia]]n [[Germans|German]] traditions, as well as the styles that were being developed in America during the 19th century. In the early days of the Society, many of the homes were initially log cabins and later, Harmonist craftsmen built timber-frame homes. At Economy, their homes were mostly two-story brick houses \"that showed the influence of their American neighbors.\"<ref>Don Blair, \"Harmonist Construction. Principally as found in the two-story houses built in Harmonie, Indiana, 1814\u20131824,\" ''[[Indiana Historical Society]] Publications'' 23, no. (1964): 81.</ref> In general, Harmonist buildings, in addition to being sturdy and functional, were centrally heated, economical to maintain, and resistant to fire, weather, and termites.<ref>Blair, p. 82.</ref>\n\nOnce established at Harmony, Pennsylvania, the Society planned to replace the log dwellings with brick structures, but the group moved to the Indiana Territory before the plan was completed.<ref name=\"Arndt, p. 109\">Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 109.</ref> In Indiana, log homes were soon replaced with one- or two-story houses of timber frame or brick construction in addition to four large rooming houses (dormitories) for its growing membership. The new town also included shops, schools, mills, a granary, a hotel, library, distilleries, breweries, a brick kiln, pottery ovens, barn, stables, storehouses, and two churches, one of which was brick.<ref>Blair, p. 49\u201350.</ref>\n\nIn 1822 William Herbert, a visitor to Harmony, Indiana, described the new brick church and the Harmonists' craftsmanship:\n\n\"These people exhibit considerable taste as well as boldness of design in some of their works. They are erecting a noble church, the roof of which is supported in\nthe interior by a great number of stately columns, which have been turned from\ntrees in their own forests. The kinds of wood made use of for this purpose are, I\nam informed, black walnut, cherry and sassafras. Nothing I think can exceed the\ngrandeur of the joinery and the masonry and brickwork seem to be of the first\norder. The form of this church is that of a cross, the limbs being short and equal;\nand as the doors, which there are four, are placed at the end of the limbs, the\ninterior of the building as seen from the entrance, has a most ample and spacious effect.... I could scarcely imagine myself to be in the woods of Indiana, on the borders of the Wabash, while pacing the long resounding aisles, and surveying the stately colonnades of this church.\"<ref name=usi/>\n\nFrame structures were built on piers to keep the air circulating across the area's damp soil, while brick structures had a root cellar with a drainage tunnel. Inside, Harmonists built fireplaces to the left or right of center to allow for a long center beam, adding strength to support the structure and its heavy, shingled roof. \"Dutch biscuits\" (wood laths wrapped in straw and mud) provided insulation and soundproofing between the ceiling and floors. The exterior was insulated with bricks between the exterior's unpainted weatherboards and the interior's lath and plaster walls.<ref>Blair, p. 52\u201354, 76.</ref> Structures had standard parts and pre-cut, pre-measured timbers, which were assembled on the ground, adjusted to fit on site, raised in place, and locked into place with pegs and mortise and tenon joints.<ref>Blair, p. 57.</ref> Two-story floor plans for homes included a large living room, kitchen, and entrance hall, with stairs to the second floor and attic. In Indiana, Harmonists did their baking in communal ovens, so stoves could be substituted for fireplaces.<ref>Blair, p. 66, 71, 73.</ref>\n\n=== Living styles ===\n\nAt Harmony, Pennsylvania, four to six members were assigned to a home, where they lived as families, although not all those living in the household were related.<ref name=\"Arndt, p. 109\"/> Even when the house contained those that were married, they would live together as brother and sister, since there was a suggestion and custom of practicing [[celibacy]].  In Indiana, Harmonists continued to live in homes, but they also built dormitories to house single men and women.<ref name=usi/>\n\nSociety members woke between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. They ate breakfast between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., lunch at 9 a.m., dinner at noon, afternoon lunch at 3 p.m., and supper between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m.<ref>Bole, p. 145.</ref> They did their chores and work during the day. At the end of the day, members met for meetings and had a curfew of 9 p.m. On Sundays, the members respected the \"Holy day\" and did no unnecessary work, but attended church services, singing groups, and other social activities.<ref name=usi/>\n\n=== Clothing ===\n\nTheir style of dress reflected their [[Swabia]]n [[Germans|German]] roots and traditions and was adapted to their life in America.<ref name=Bole146>Bole, p. 146.</ref> Although the Harmonites typically wore [[plain dress|plain clothing]], made with their own materials by their own tailors, they would wear their fine garments on Sundays and on other special occasions. At Economy, on special occasions and Sundays, women wore silk dresses using fabric of their own manufacture.<ref name=Bole146/> Clothing varied in color, but often carried the same design. On a typical day, women wore ankle-length dresses, while men wore pants with vests or coats and a hat.<ref name=usi/>\n\n=== Technology ===\n\nThe Harmonites were a prosperous agricultural and industrial people. They had many machines that helped them be successful in their trades. They even had steam-powered engines that ran the machines at some of their factories in [[Old Economy Village|Economy]]. They kept their machines up to date, and had many factories and mills.\n\n=== Work ===\n\nEach member of the Society had a job in a certain craft or trade. Most of the work done by men consisted of manual labor, while the women dealt more with textiles or agriculture.\n\nAs Economy became more technologically developed, Harmonites began to hire others from outside the Society, especially when their numbers decreased because of the custom of celibacy and as they eventually let fewer new members join. Although the Harmonites did seek work-oriented help from the outside, they were known as a community that supported themselves, kept their ways of living in their community, mainly exported goods, and tried to import as little as possible.\n\n== Rise and fall of Harmony Society ==\n\n[[George Rapp]] had an [[Eloquence|eloquent]] style, which matched his commanding presence, and he was the personality that led the group through all the different settlements. After Rapp's death in 1847, a number of members left the group because of disappointment and disillusionment over the fact that his prophecies regarding the return of Jesus Christ in his lifetime were not fulfilled. However, many stayed in the group, and the Harmony Society went on to become an even more profitable business community that had many worldly financial successes under the leadership of Romelius L. Baker and Jacob Henrici.\n\nOver time the group became more protective of itself, did not allow many new members, moved further from its religious foundation to a more business-oriented and pragmatic approach, and the custom of [[celibacy]] eventually drained it of its membership. The land and financial assets of the Harmony Society were sold off by the few remaining members under the leadership of John Duss and his wife, Susanna, by the year 1906.\n\nToday, many of the Society's remaining buildings are preserved; all three of their settlements in the United States have been declared [[National Historic Landmark|National Historic Landmark Districts]] by the [[National Park Service]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Economy, Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Geneva College]]\n* [[Harmonie State Park]]\n* [[Harmony, Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Harmony Historic District]]\n* [[Harmony Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania]]\n* [[New Harmony Historic District]]\n* [[New Harmony, Indiana]]\n* [[New International Encyclopedia]]\n* [[Old Economy Village]]\n* [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]]\n* [[Zoar, Ohio]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Arndt, Karl J.

He abandoned the imperial politics of his father and concentrated mainly on internal affairs. He was married to [[Eudocia (daughter of Valentinian III)|Eudocia]], daughter of [[western Roman Emperor]] [[Valentinian III]] (419\u2013455) and [[Licinia Eudoxia]]. The couple had one child, a son named [[Hilderic]].\n\nHuneric was the first Vandal king who used the title ''King of the Vandals and [[Alans]]''. Despite adopting this style, and that the Vandals maintained their sea-power and their hold on the islands of the western Mediterranean, Huneric did not have the prestige that his father Genseric had enjoyed with other states.\n\n== Biography ==\nHuneric was a son of King [[Genseric]] (or Gaiseric), and was sent to Italy as a hostage in 435, when his father made a treaty with the Western emperor Valentinian III. Huneric became king of the Vandals on his father's death in 477. Like Gaiseric he was an Arian, and his reign is chiefly memorable for his persecution of members of the orthodox Christian Church in his dominions.

Yet his reign opened with making a number of positive overtures towards the local Roman population. Following the visit of a diplomatic mission from the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] led by Alexander, Huneric restored properties seized by his father from the merchants of [[Carthage]].<ref>Malchus, fragment 13.

On February 1, 484 he organized a [[Council of Carthage (484)|meeting of Catholic bishops with Arian bishop]]s, but on February 24, 484 he forcibly removed the Catholic bishops from their offices and banished some to [[Corsica]]. A few were executed, including the former [[proconsul]] [[Victorian, Frumentius and Companions|Victorian along with Frumentius and other wealthy merchants]], who were killed at [[Hadrumetum]] after refusing to become Arians.<ref>[http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0323.shtml Saint Patrick's Church: Saints of March 23]</ref> Among those exiled was [[Vigilius of Thapsus|Vigilius]], bishop of [[Thapsus]], who published a theological treatise against Arianism.\n\nAdditionally, Huneric murdered many members of the [[Hasdingi]] dynasty and also persecuted [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]].<ref>''Persecution of the Hasdingi'': Victor of Vita, 2.12-17; translated by John Moorhead, pp. 28-30.

Several ex-votos found in his temples revealed his role as initiator of young adulthood, among them soldiers and hunters, since war and certain forms of hunting were seen as ceremonial initiatory ordeals. This function of Hermes explains why some images in temples and other vessels show him as a teenager.\nAs a patron of the [[gym]] and [[fighting]], Hermes had statues in gyms and he was also worshiped in the sanctuary of the Twelve Gods in Olympia where Greeks celebrated the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]].

His name, in the form ''[[herma]],'' was applied to a wayside marker pile of stones; each traveler added a stone to the pile. In the 6th century BC, [[Hipparchus (tyrant)|Hipparchos]], the son of [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Pisistratus]], replaced the [[cairn]]s that marked the midway point between each village ''[[deme]]'' at the central ''[[agora]]'' of Athens with a square or rectangular pillar of stone or bronze topped by a bust of Hermes with a [[beard]]. An erect [[phallus]] rose from the base. In the more primitive [[Mount Kyllini]] or Cyllenian herms, the standing stone or wooden pillar was simply a carved phallus. In Athens, herms were placed outside houses for good luck. \"That a monument of this kind could be transformed into an [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] god is astounding,\" [[Walter Burkert]] remarked.<ref>[[Walter Burkert]], 1985.

During [[Archaic Greece]] he was usually depicted as a mature man, bearded, dressed as a traveler, herald, or pastor. During [[Classical Greece|Classical]] and [[Hellenistic Greece]] he is usually depicted young and nude, with athleticism, as befits the god of speech and of the gymnastics, or a robe, a formula is set predominantly through the centuries.  When represented as Logios (Greek: \u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, speaker), his attitude is consistent with the attribute. [[Phidias]] left a statue of a famous Hermes Logios and [[Praxiteles]] another, also well known, showing him with the baby [[Dionysus]] in his arms. At all times, however, through the Hellenistic periods, Roman, and throughout Western history into the present day, several of his characteristic objects are present as identification, but not always all together.<ref name= Smith/><ref>[[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller, Karl Otfried]].

Another object is the Porta: a stick, called a skeptron (scepter), which is referred to{{by whom|date=July 2014}} as a magic wand. Some early sources{{who|date=July 2014}} say that this was the bat he received from Apollo, but others{{who|date=July 2014}} question the merits of this claim. It seems that there may have been two canes, one of a shepherd's staff, as stated in the Homeric Hymn, and the other a magic wand, according to some authors.{{who|date=July 2014}} His bat also came to be called kerykeion, the [[caduceus]], in later times.  Early depictions of the staff show it as a baton stick topped by a golden way{{clarify|date=July 2014}} that resembled the number eight, though sometimes with its top truncated and open. Later the staff had two intertwined snakes and sometimes it was crowned with a pair of wings and a ball, but the old form remained in use even when Hermes was associated with Mercury by the Romans.<ref name= Smith/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzNfeQSXKfcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Hermes+the+thief&hl=en&src=bmrr&ei=0r-9TeF574zRAbrGgdwF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Hermes the Thief|date=}}</ref>\n\n[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] explained the presence of snakes, saying that Hermes was traveling in Arcadia when he saw two snakes intertwined in battle. He put the caduceus between them and parted, and so said his staff would bring peace.<ref>Hyginus. ''Astronomica'', 2.7. Cited in [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/HermesGod.html#Heraldry \"God of Heralds and Bringer of Peace\"]. The Theoi Project: Greek Mythology.</ref> The caduceus, historically, appeared with Hermes, and is documented among the Babylonians from about 3500 BC. The two snakes coiled around a stick was a symbol of the god [[Ningishzida]], which served as a mediator between humans and the goddess [[Ishtar]] or the supreme [[Ningirsu]]. In Greece itself the other gods have been depicted holding a caduceus, but it was mainly associated with Hermes.  It was said to have the power to make people fall asleep or wake up, and also made peace between litigants, and is a visible sign of his authority, being used as a sceptre.<ref name=Smith/>\n\nHe was represented in doorways, possibly as an [[amulet]] of good fortune, or as a symbol of purification.  The caduceus is not to be confused with the [[Rod of Asclepius]], the patron of medicine and son of [[Apollo]], which bears only one snake.  The rod of [[Asclepius]] was adopted by most Western doctors as a badge of their profession, but in several medical organizations of the United States, the caduceus took its place since the 18th century, although this use is declining.  After the Renaissance the caduceus also appeared in the heraldic crests of several, and currently is a symbol of commerce.<ref name=Smith/>\n\nHis sandals, called ''p\u00e9dila'' by the Greeks and ''talaria'' by the Romans, were made of palm and myrtle branches but were described as beautiful, golden and immortal, made a sublime art, able to take the roads with the speed of wind. Originally, they had no wings, but late in the artistic representations, they are depicted. In certain images, the wings spring directly from the ankles. Hermes has also been depicted with a purse or a bag in his hands, wearing a robe or cloak, which had the power to confer invisibility.

They play a central and unambiguous role in traditional asset markets, where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios. Equity and debt [[index fund]] products provide investable access to most developed markets in these asset classes. Hedge funds, however, are actively managed, so that tracking is impossible. Non-investable hedge fund indices on the other hand may be more or less representative, but returns data on many of the reference group of funds is non-public. This may result in biased estimates of their returns. In an attempt to address this problem, clone indices have been created in an attempt to replicate the statistical properties of hedge funds without being directly based on their returns data.  None of these approaches achieves the accuracy of indices in other asset classes for which there is more complete published data concerning the underlying returns.<ref>A source for hedge fund track records is the [https://www.cambridgeassociates.com/foundations_endowments/working_together/specialized_expertise/alternative_assets/indicies_benchmarking.html Cambridge Associates Private Equity Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917052031/http://www.cambridgeassociates.com/foundations_endowments/working_together/specialized_expertise/alternative_assets/indicies_benchmarking.html |date=17 September 2013 }}.</ref>\n\n====Non-investable indices====\nNon-investable indices are indicative in nature, and aim to represent the performance of some database of hedge funds using some measure such as mean, median or weighted mean from a hedge fund database. The databases have diverse selection criteria and methods of construction, and no single database captures all funds. This leads to significant differences in reported performance between different indices.\n\nAlthough they aim to be representative, non-investable indices suffer from a lengthy and largely unavoidable list of [[Selection bias|biases]].\n\nFunds' participation in a database is voluntary, leading to [[self-selection bias]] because those funds that choose to report may not be typical of funds as a whole. For example, some do not report because of poor results or because they have already reached their target size and do not wish to raise further money..\n\nThe short lifetimes of many hedge funds means that there are many new entrants and many departures each year, which raises the problem of [[Attrition bias|survivorship bias]]. If we examine only funds that have survived to the present, we will overestimate past returns because many of the worst-performing funds have not survived, and the observed association between fund youth and fund performance suggests that this bias may be substantial.\n\nWhen a fund is added to a database for the first time, all or part of its historical data is recorded ex-post in the database. It is likely that funds only publish their results when they are favorable, so that the average performances displayed by the funds during their incubation period are inflated. This is known as \"instant history bias\" or \"backfill bias\".\n\n====Investable indices====\nInvestable indices are an attempt to reduce these problems by ensuring that the return of the index is available to shareholders. To create an investable index, the index provider selects funds and develops structured products or derivative instruments that deliver the performance of the index.  When investors buy these products the index provider makes the investments in the underlying funds, making an investable index similar in some ways to a fund of hedge funds portfolio.\n\nTo make the index investable, hedge funds must agree to accept investments on the terms given by the constructor.  To make the index liquid, these terms must include provisions for redemptions that some managers may consider too onerous to be acceptable.  This means that investable indices do not represent the total universe of hedge funds. Most seriously, they under-represent more successful managers, who typically refuse to accept such investment protocols.\n\n====Hedge fund replication====\nThe most recent addition to the field approach the problem in a different manner.  Instead of reflecting the performance of actual hedge funds they take a statistical approach to the analysis of historic hedge fund returns, and use this to construct a model of how hedge fund returns respond to the movements of various investable financial assets.  This model is then used to construct an investable portfolio of those assets.  This makes the index investable, and in principle they can be as representative as the hedge fund database from which they were constructed.\n\nHowever, these clone indices rely on a statistical modelling process.  Such indices have too short a history to state whether this approach will be considered successful.\n\n==== Closures ====\nIn March 2017, HFR \u2013 a hedge fund research data and service provider \u2013 reported that there were more hedge-fund closures in 2016 than during the 2009 recession. According to the report, several large public pension funds pulled their investments in hedge funds, because the funds\u2019 subpar performance as a group did not merit the high fees they charged.\n\nDespite the hedge fund industry topping $3 trillion for the first time ever in 2016, the number of new hedge funds launched fell short of [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|crisis]]-era figures. There were 729 hedge fund launches in 2016, fewer than the 784 opened in 2009 and dramatically less than the 968 launches in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/03/17/hedge-funds-close-at-faster-pace-in-2016-than-2009-recession/|title=Hedge funds close at faster pace in 2016 than 2009 recession|last=English|first=Carleton|date=18 March 2017|website=New York Post|access-date=21 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Debates and controversies==\n\n===Systemic risk===\n[[Systemic risk]] refers to the risk of instability across the entire financial system, as opposed to within a single company.

In addition, while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage, hedge funds differ from many other market participants, such as banks and mutual funds, in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage, and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their market strategy.  The extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis, particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments. The close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers, typically investment banks, can lead to domino effects in a crisis, and indeed failing counterparty banks can freeze hedge funds. These systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets.  The global hedge fund industry has over $2 trillion in assets, and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage, which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested.\n\nAn August 2012 survey by the [[Financial Services Authority]] concluded that risks were limited and had reduced as a result, ''inter alia'', of larger margins being required by counterparty banks, but might change rapidly according to market conditions. In stressed market conditions, investors might suddenly withdraw large sums, resulting in forced asset sales. This might cause liquidity and pricing problems if it occurred across a number of funds or in one large highly leveraged fund.<ref>{{cite web\n|url         = http://www.fsa.gov.uk/static/pubs/other/hedge-fund-report-aug2012.pdf\n|title       = Assessing the possible sources of systemic risk from hedge funds\n|author      = Financial Services Authority\n|date        = August 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n===Transparency===\nHedge funds are structured to avoid most direct regulation (although their managers may be regulated) and are not required to publicly disclose their investment activities, except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements. This is in contrast to a regulated [[mutual fund]] or [[exchange-traded fund]], which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure. An investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund, and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds. This may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions. However, this high level of disclosure is not available to non-investors, contributing to hedge funds' reputation for secrecy, while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors.<ref>Carrie Johnson, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/28/AR2006062801909.html \"Scrutiny Urged for Hedge Funds\"] ''The Washington Post'' (29 June 2006).

One of the attractive features of hedge funds (in particular [[market neutral]] and similar funds) is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities. This means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers, reducing overall portfolio risk.<ref name=\"Roadmap\" />\n\nHowever, there are three reasons why one might not wish to allocate a high proportion of assets into hedge funds. These reasons are:\n* Hedge funds are highly individual and it is hard to estimate the likely returns or risks.\n* Hedge funds' low correlation with other assets tends to dissipate during stressful market events, making them much less useful for diversification than they may appear.\n* Hedge fund returns are reduced considerably by the high fee structures that are typically charged.\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios, but this is disputed for example by Mark Kritzman who performed a mean-variance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock index fund, a bond index fund, and ten hypothetical hedge funds.<ref>''Portfolio Efficiency with Performance Fees'', Economics and Political Strategy (newsletter), February 2007, Peter L. Bernstein Inc.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hulbert |first=Mark |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/business/yourmoney/04stra.html |title=Hulbert, Mark ''2 + 20, and Other Hedge Fund Math'', '&#39;New York Times'&#39;, 4 March 2007 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 March 2007 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}</ref> The optimizer found that a mean-variance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds, largely because of the impact of performance fees. To demonstrate this, Kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds incurred no performance fees. The result from this second optimization was an allocation of 74% to hedge funds.\n\nThe other factor reducing the attractiveness of hedge funds in a diversified portfolio is that they tend to perform poorly during equity bear markets, just when an investor needs part of their portfolio to add value.<ref name=\"Roadmap\" /> For example, in January\u2013September 2008, the Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index was down 9.87%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hedgeindex.com/hedgeindex/en/default.aspx?cy=USD |title=Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Index web page |website=HedgeIndex.com |accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref> According to the same index series, even \"dedicated short bias\" funds had a return of \u22126.08% during September 2008. In other words, even though low average correlations may appear to make hedge funds attractive this may not work in turbulent period, for example around the collapse of [[Lehman Brothers]] in September 2008.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Activist shareholder]]\n* [[Alternative asset]]\n* [[Board of directors]]\n* [[Corporate governance]]\n* [[Fund governance]]\n* [[Investment banking]]\n* [[List of hedge funds]]\n* [[Vulture fund]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Thomas P.

Paramorfan is the trade name of dihydromorphine from another manufacturer, as is Paracodin, for dihydrocodeine.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe name Dicodid was registered in the United States and appears without a monograph as late as 1978 in the [[Physicians' Desk Reference]]; Dicodid may have been marketed to one extent or another in North America in the 1920s and early 1930s. The drug was pure hydrocodone in small 5 and 10&nbsp;mg tablets, physically similar to the Dilaudid tablets. It is no longer manufactured by Knoll in Germany, nor is a generic available. Hydrocodone was never as common in Europe as it is in North America\u2014dihydrocodeine is used for its spectrum of indications. Germany was the number two consumer of hydrocodone until the manufacture of the drug was discontinued there. Now,{{when?|date=June 2018}} the world outside the United States accounts for less than 1% of annual consumption.

In 1840 [[Louis Aubert-Roche]] reported his successful use of hashish against pestilence.<ref name=\"EMCDDA08\" />  Also psychiatric experiments with hashish were done at the same time with [[Jacques-Joseph Moreau]] being convinced that it is the supreme medicament for use in psychiatry.<ref name=\"EMCDDA08\" />\n\nIn the 19th century, hashish was embraced in some European literary circles. Most famously, the [[Club des Hashischins]] was a [[Paris]]ian club dedicated to the consumption of hashish and other drugs; its members included literary luminaries such as [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]], [[Jacques-Joseph Moreau|Dr. Moreau de Tours]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]].<ref name=\"levin\">Levinthal, C.

At around the same time, American author [[Fitz Hugh Ludlow]] wrote the 1857 book ''[[The Hasheesh Eater]]'' about his youthful experiences, both positive and negative, with the drug.\n\nHashish was also mentioned and used as an anesthetic in Germany in 1869. At these times, hashish was imported in great quantities especially from India and called charas. However, there were also people who did not deem cannabis as harmless.<ref name=\"EMCDDA08\" /> Between 1880 and 1900 was the peak of the medicinal use, where hashish compounds were most commonplace in almost all European countries and the USA. Evidence of misuse at that time was practically non-existent (as opposed to widespread reports in Asia and Africa).<ref name=\"EMCDDA08\"/> Hashish played a significant role in the treatment of pain, migraine, dysmenorrhea, pertussis asthma and insomnia in Europe and USA towards the end of the 19th century. Rare applications included stomach ache, depression, diarrhea, diminished appetite, pruritus, hemorrhage, [[Basedow syndrome]] and malaria.<ref name=\"EMCDDA08\"/> The usage of hashish decreased as even supporters agreed on the unreliability of its compounds, with critics calling it worthless and dangerous. Eventually, hashish as a medicine disappeared completely in the 20th century with the introduction of specific medicines for all of its main applications.<ref name=\"EMCDDA08\"/> The use was later prohibited worldwide as the use as a medicine was made impossible by the 1961 UN [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the majority of hashish in Europe came from Kashmir, Afghanistan, and parts of India, as well as Greece, Syria, Nepal, Lebanon, and Turkey. Larger markets developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s when most of the hashish was imported from Pakistan and Afghanistan.

While Morocco held a quasi-monopoly in the 1990s with the so-called 250g \"soap bar\" blocks, which were of low quality, Afghanistan has now been announced the biggest producer of higher quality hashish. Since then, the quality in Europe has increased while the prices have remained stable.<ref name=\"EMCDDA08\" />\n\n==European market==\nAccording to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), Western Europe is the biggest market for cannabis resin with 70% of global seizures. The European hashish market is changing though: Cannabis cultivation increased throughout the 1990s until 2004, with a noticeable decrease reported in 2005 according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.<ref name=\"EMCDDA08\" />\nMorocco has been the major source, however lately there has been a shift in the market and Afghanistan has been named the major producer of Hashish. Even though a drop in usage and production has been reported, Morocco produced around 6600 tonnes of resin in 2005.<ref name=\"EMCDDA08\" />\n\nAs 641 tonnes of hashish were consumed in the EU in 2013, the European market is currently the world\u2019s largest and most profitable. Therefore, many actors are involved in the business, including organised crime groups. The largest cannabis resin seizures in Europe happen in Spain, due to its proximity to Northern Africa.<ref name=\"EMCDDA08\" />\n\nThe 1990s \"soap bars\" disappeared and the physical shapes of hashish changed to melon shaped, tablets or olive shaped pellets. Overall the general trend of domestically grown cannabis displacing the imported resin leads to a market reaction of potency changes while the prices remain stable while soap-bar potency increased from 8% to up to 20.7% in 2014.<ref name=\"EMCDDA08\" />\n\nGenerally, more resin than herb is consumed in Europe.<ref name=\"EMCDDA08\" />\n\n==Substance properties==\nAs hashish is a derivative of [[cannabis]], it has the same substance properties. When smoked, [[THC]] can be detected in plasma within seconds, with a half-life of 2 hours. Due to its lipophilic nature, it is widely distributed through the body, and some metabolites can be detected in urine for up to two weeks following consumption.<ref name=EMCDDAProfile>{{cite web|title=Cannabis drug profile|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/cannabis|website=emcdda.europa.eu|accessdate=19 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nHashish is made from [[cannabinoid]]-rich glandular hairs known as [[trichomes]], as well as varying amounts of cannabis flower and leaf fragments.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gloss|first1=D|title=An Overview of Products and Bias in Research|journal=Neurotherapeutics|date=October 2015|volume=12|issue=4|pages=731\u20134|doi=10.1007/s13311-015-0370-x|pmid=26202343|pmc=4604179|type=Review}}</ref> The flowers of a mature female plant contain the most trichomes, though trichomes are also found on other parts of the plant.

In some parts of Canada, individuals do what is known as \"bottle tokes\", in which they take a lit cigarette, stick a \"bot\"(small hashish ball) then let the smoke fill the bottle before inhalation.

Taste and smell seem intensified and visual scenes seem to have more depth while sounds are heard with more dimension.<ref name = Tart/> Perception of time is also reported to change: there is a general experience of time distortion where events take longer to occur and the subject is involved in internal fantasies with the impression that external time has slowed down.<ref name = Tart/> However, there seems to be no impression of speed or rapidity for internal processes. Similar effects are common in normal experience, for example when time slows down in boredom. It is proposed that this distortion is caused as the experience itself is the focus of attention rather than what is happening around the individual.<ref name = Tart/>\n\nFunctional associations seem to decrease in strength and there are fewer mental impositions on the sensory perception of the object. Aspects which are normally filtered out are given equal attention. Therefore, objects are not necessarily conceptualized via their use but rather experienced as a whole.<ref name = Tart/> Detailed attention is paid, focussing on certain aspects of an object, a sentence or any other perceptual input in a magnifying way. Clearly the attention process is affected. Only a narrow amount of diverse content is the focus of attention and fewer objects are perceived.<ref name = Tart/> A person may become absorbed by one object, event or process up to the exclusion of everything else, which has been called a train of fantasy and has been described as a form of tunnel vision where the individual is more aware of an individual element of meaning, emotion etc. There seems to be a certain unity of attention while normally attention relies on multiple channels.<ref name = Tart/> Flights of fantasy and dreaming, including perceiving connections and associations of ideas that do not seem accessible in a normal state are often reported.<ref name = Tart/>\n\nThere seems to be a reduction of the automatic availability of memory images, however an increased strength of memories when relevant to central needs.<ref name = Tart/> Experiences seem new and are experienced without a feeling of familiarity and is more intense if emotionally salient. This emotional force may activate internal imagery, which is used to search for identity or to interpret incoming stimuli.<ref name = Tart/> Short term memory becomes shorter and in a very high state the sequence of thoughts is not remembered past one or two transitions.<ref name = Tart/>\n\nExpectancies and anticipation which are important to keep behaviour consistent in normal states seem to be decreased in strength which might lead to surprising or out-of-character behaviour.<ref name = Tart/> Normally these expectancies let the person behave in a goal directed and reasonable manner, with the decrease the person might act out in illogical and unforeseeable ways. Similarly inhibitions, especially social inhibition seems to be reduced, resulting in playful behaviour and acting on impulses.<ref name = Tart/>\n\n== Manufacturing processes ==\n{{anchor|Honey oil}}\n[[File:R\u00e9colte de la r\u00e9sine de cannabis, Uttarakhand, Inde 288x512.ogv|thumb|upright|Making charas from fresh ''cannabis'' resin, [[Uttarakhand]], India]]\nThe sticky resins of the fresh flowering female cannabis plant are collected by pressing or rubbing the flowering plant between two hands and then forming the sticky resins into a small ball of hashish called charas.\n\nMechanical separation methods use physical action to remove the trichomes from the dried plant material, such as sieving through a screen by hand or in motorized tumblers.  This technique is known as \"drysifting\". The resulting powder, referred to as \"kief\" or \"drysift\", is compressed with the aid of heat into blocks of hashish; if pure, the kief will become gooey and pliable. When a high level of pure THC is present, the end product will be almost transparent and will start to melt at the point of human contact.\n\n[[Ice-water separation]] is another mechanical method of isolating trichomes. Newer techniques have been developed such as heat and pressure separations, static-electricity sieving or acoustical dry sieving.<ref>Skunk Pharma Search, ''[http://skunkpharmresearch.com/acoustical-dry-sieving/ Acoustical dry sieving]''</ref>\n\n[[File:American medical hashish(3).jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Trichome]]s isolated with ice-water extraction method.]]\n\nTrichomes may break away from supporting stalks and leaves when plant material becomes brittle at low temperatures.

Remaining plant materials are filtered out of the solution and sent to the compost. The solvent is then evaporated, or boiled off (purged) leaving behind the desirable resins, called honey oil, \"[[hash oil]]\", or just \"oil\". Honey oil still contains [[wax]]es and [[essential oil]]s and can be further purified by [[vacuum distillation]] to yield \"red oil\". The product of chemical separations is more commonly referred to as \"honey oil.\" This oil is not really hashish, as the latter name covers trichomes that are extracted by sieving.

Traditionally, this was interpreted as a method of putting the subject into a \"hypnotic trance\"; however, subsequent \"nonstate\" theorists have viewed it differently, seeing it as a means of heightening client expectation, defining their role, focusing attention, etc. There are several different induction techniques. One of the most influential methods was Braid's \"eye-fixation\" technique, also known as \"Braidism\". Many variations of the eye-fixation approach exist, including the induction used in the [[Hypnotic susceptibility|Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale]] (SHSS), the most widely used research tool in the field of hypnotism.<ref name=\"Weitzenhoffer\">{{Cite book |last= Weitzenhoffer & Hilgard |title= Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scales, Forms A & B. |year= 1959 |publisher= Consulting Psychologists Press |location= Palo Alto, CA}}</ref> Braid's original description of his induction is as follows:{{quotation|Take any bright object (e.g. a lancet case) between the thumb and fore and middle fingers of the left hand; hold it from about eight to fifteen inches from the eyes, at such position above the forehead as may be necessary to produce the greatest possible strain upon the eyes and eyelids, and enable the patient to maintain a steady fixed stare at the object. <br /><br />The patient must be made to understand that he is to keep the eyes steadily fixed on the object, and the mind riveted on the idea of that one object. It will be observed, that owing to the consensual adjustment of the eyes, the pupils will be at first contracted: They will shortly begin to dilate, and, after they have done so to a considerable extent, and have assumed a wavy motion, if the fore and middle fingers of the right hand, extended and a little separated, are carried from the object toward the eyes, most probably the eyelids will close involuntarily, with a vibratory motion. If this is not the case, or the patient allows the eyeballs to move, desire him to begin anew, giving him to understand that he is to allow the eyelids to close when the fingers are again carried towards the eyes, but that the eyeballs must be kept fixed, in the same position, and the mind riveted to the one idea of the object held above the eyes. In general, it will be found, that the eyelids close with a vibratory motion, or become spasmodically closed.<ref>Braid (1843), p. 27.</ref>}}\nBraid later acknowledged that the hypnotic induction technique was not necessary in every case, and subsequent researchers have generally found that on average it contributes less than previously expected to the effect of hypnotic suggestions.<ref name=\"Barber, Spanos 1974\" /> Variations and alternatives to the original hypnotic induction techniques were subsequently developed. However, this method is still considered authoritative.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} In 1941, Robert White wrote: \"It can be safely stated that nine out of ten hypnotic techniques call for reclining posture, muscular relaxation, and optical fixation followed by eye closure.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|year=1941|title=A preface to the theory of hypnotism|journal=Journal of Abnormal & Social Psychology|volume=36|issue=4|pages=477\u2013505 (498)|doi=10.1037/h0053844|author=White, Robert W.}}</ref>\n\n=== Suggestion ===\n{{Main|Suggestion}}\nWhen [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] first described hypnotism, he did not use the term \"suggestion\" but referred instead to the act of focusing the conscious mind of the subject upon a single dominant idea. Braid's main therapeutic strategy involved stimulating or reducing physiological functioning in different regions of the body. In his later works, however, Braid placed increasing emphasis upon the use of a variety of different verbal and non-verbal forms of suggestion, including the use of \"waking suggestion\" and self-hypnosis. Subsequently, [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] shifted the emphasis from the physical state of hypnosis on to the psychological process of verbal suggestion:\n\n<blockquote>\nI define hypnotism as the induction of a peculiar psychical [i.e., mental] condition which increases the susceptibility to suggestion. Often, it is true, the [hypnotic] sleep that may be induced facilitates suggestion, but it is not the necessary preliminary. It is suggestion that rules hypnotism.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?ei=eFQUVI6ANIz07AaA-YGoBw&id=RVtNAQAAIAAJ&dq=hypnosis+and+suggestion&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22i+define%22 Bernheim, H., ''Hypnosis & suggestion in psychotherapy: a treatise on the nature and uses of hypnotism''. Tr. from the 2d rev. ed., University Books, 1964, p. 15.]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBernheim's conception of the primacy of verbal suggestion in hypnotism dominated the subject throughout the 20th century, leading some authorities to declare him the father of modern hypnotism.<ref name=\"Weitzenhoffer, 2000\" />\n\nContemporary hypnotism uses a variety of suggestion forms including direct verbal suggestions, \"indirect\" verbal suggestions such as requests or insinuations, metaphors and other rhetorical figures of speech, and non-verbal suggestion in the form of mental imagery, voice tonality, and physical manipulation. A distinction is commonly made between suggestions delivered \"permissively\" and those delivered in a more \"authoritarian\" manner. Harvard hypnotherapist [[Deirdre Barrett]] writes that most modern research suggestions are designed to bring about immediate responses, whereas hypnotherapeutic suggestions are usually post-hypnotic ones that are intended to trigger responses affecting behaviour for periods ranging from days to a lifetime in duration. The hypnotherapeutic ones are often repeated in multiple sessions before they achieve peak effectiveness.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barrett|first=Deirdre|title=The Pregnant Man: Cases from a Hypnotherapist's Couch|year=1998|publisher=Times Books}}</ref>\n\n==== Conscious and unconscious mind ====\nSome hypnotists view suggestion as a form of communication that is directed primarily to the subject's conscious mind,<ref name=\"Rossi\">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.studiopsicologiamantova.it/psy/psicologia/miltonerickson/what-is-a-suggestion.pdf |title=What is a suggestion?

Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory describes conscious thoughts as being at the surface of the mind and unconscious processes as being deeper in the mind.<ref>Daniel L. Schacter; Daniel T. Gilbert; Daniel M. Wegner, ''Psychology'', 2009, 2011</ref> Braid, Bernheim, and other Victorian pioneers of hypnotism did not refer to the unconscious mind but saw hypnotic suggestions as being addressed to the subject's ''conscious'' mind. Indeed, Braid actually defines hypnotism as focused (conscious) attention upon a dominant idea (or suggestion). Different views regarding the nature of the mind have led to different conceptions of suggestion. Hypnotists who believe that responses are mediated primarily by an \"unconscious mind\", like [[Milton Erickson]], make use of indirect suggestions such as metaphors or stories whose intended meaning may be concealed from the subject's conscious mind. The concept of [[Subliminal message|subliminal suggestion]] depends upon this view of the mind. By contrast, hypnotists who believe that responses to suggestion are primarily mediated by the conscious mind, such as [[Theodore X. Barber|Theodore Barber]] and [[Nicholas Spanos]], have tended to make more use of direct verbal suggestions and instructions.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==== Ideo-dynamic reflex ====\n{{Main|Ideomotor response}}\nThe first neuropsychological theory of hypnotic suggestion was introduced early by James Braid who adopted his friend and colleague [[William Benjamin Carpenter|William Carpenter's]] theory of the [[ideo motor response|ideo-motor reflex response]] to account for the phenomenon of hypnotism. Carpenter had observed from close examination of everyday experience that, under certain circumstances, the mere idea of a muscular movement could be sufficient to produce a reflexive, or automatic, contraction or movement of the muscles involved, albeit in a very small degree. Braid extended Carpenter's theory to encompass the observation that a wide variety of bodily responses besides muscular movement can be thus affected, for example, the idea of sucking a lemon can automatically stimulate salivation, a secretory response. Braid, therefore, adopted the term \"ideo-dynamic\", meaning \"by the power of an idea\", to explain a broad range of \"psycho-physiological\" (mind\u2013body) phenomena. Braid coined the term \"mono-ideodynamic\" to refer to the theory that hypnotism operates by concentrating attention on a single idea in order to amplify the ideo-dynamic reflex response. Variations of the basic ideo-motor, or ideo-dynamic, theory of suggestion have continued to exercise considerable influence over subsequent theories of hypnosis, including those of [[Clark L. Hull]], [[Hans Eysenck]], and Ernest Rossi.<ref name=\"Rossi\" /> It should be noted that in Victorian psychology the word \"idea\" encompasses any mental representation, including mental imagery, memories, etc.\n\n=== Susceptibility ===\n{{Main|Hypnotic susceptibility}}\nBraid made a rough distinction between different stages of hypnosis, which he termed the first and second conscious stage of hypnotism;<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vs35STwQYQoC&q=%5B...%5D+%22real+origin+and+essence%22+polar+#v=snippet&q=%5B...%5D%20%22real%20origin%20and%20essence%22%20polar&f=false Braid, J., ''Hypnotic Therapeutics: Illustrated by Cases : with an Appendix on Table-moving and Spirit-rapping'', Murray and Gibb, printers, 1853.

However, [[Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault]] and Hippolyte Bernheim introduced more complex hypnotic \"depth\" scales based on a combination of behavioural, physiological, and subjective responses, some of which were due to direct suggestion and some of which were not. In the first few decades of the 20th century, these early clinical \"depth\" scales were superseded by more sophisticated \"hypnotic susceptibility\" scales based on experimental research. The most influential were the Davis\u2013Husband and Friedlander\u2013Sarbin scales developed in the 1930s. [[Andr\u00e9 Muller Weitzenhoffer|Andr\u00e9 Weitzenhoffer]] and [[Ernest R. Hilgard]] developed the Stanford Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility in 1959, consisting of 12 suggestion test items following a standardised hypnotic eye-fixation induction script, and this has become one of the most widely referenced research tools in the field of hypnosis. Soon after, in 1962, Ronald Shor and Emily Carota Orne developed a similar group scale called the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility (HGSHS).\n\nWhereas the older \"depth scales\" tried to infer the level of \"hypnotic trance\" from supposed observable signs such as spontaneous amnesia, most subsequent scales have measured the degree of observed or self-evaluated ''responsiveness'' to specific suggestion tests such as direct suggestions of arm rigidity (catalepsy). The Stanford, Harvard, HIP, and most other susceptibility scales convert numbers into an assessment of a person's susceptibility as \"high\", \"medium\", or \"low\". Approximately 80% of the population are medium, 10% are high, and 10% are low. There is some controversy as to whether this is distributed on a \"normal\" bell-shaped curve or whether it is bi-modal with a small \"blip\" of people at the high end.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Piccione|first1=C.|last2=Hilgard|first2=E.

Dissociaters often have a history of childhood abuse or other trauma, learned to escape into numbness, and to forget unpleasant events.

In many cultures and religions, it was regarded as a form of meditation. Modern day hypnosis, however, started in the late 18th century and was made popular by [[Franz Mesmer]], a German physician who became known as the father of \u2018modern hypnotism\u2019. In fact, hypnosis used to be known as \u2018Mesmerism\u2019 as it was named after Mesmer.\n\nMesmer held the opinion that hypnosis was a sort of mystical force that flows from the hypnotist to the person being hypnotized, but his theory was dismissed by critics who asserted that there is no magical element to hypnotism.\n\nBefore long, hypnotism started finding its way into the world of modern medicine. The use of hypnotism in the medical field was made popular by surgeons and physicians like [[Elliotson]] and James Esdaille and researchers like James Braid who helped to reveal the biological and physical benefits of hypnotism.<ref>Book: Hypnosis Beginners Guide: Learn How To Use Hypnosis To Relieve Stress, Anxiety, Depression And Become Happier</ref> According to his writings, Braid began to hear reports concerning various Oriental [[meditation|meditative practices]] soon after the release of his first publication on hypnotism, ''Neurypnology'' (1843). He first discussed some of these oriental practices in a series of articles entitled ''Magic, Mesmerism, Hypnotism, etc., Historically & Physiologically Considered''. He drew analogies between his own practice of hypnotism and various forms of Hindu yoga meditation and other ancient spiritual practices, especially those involving [[Premature burial#Voluntary burial|voluntary burial]] and apparent [[human hibernation]]. Braid's interest in these practices stems from his studies of the ''[[Dabist\u0101n-i Maz\u0101hib]]'', the \"School of Religions\", an ancient Persian text describing a wide variety of Oriental religious rituals, beliefs, and practices.\n\n<blockquote>\nLast May [1843], a gentleman residing in Edinburgh, personally unknown to me, who had long resided in India, favored me with a letter expressing his approbation of the views which I had published on the nature and causes of hypnotic and mesmeric phenomena. In corroboration of my views, he referred to what he had previously witnessed in oriental regions, and recommended me to look into the ''Dabistan'', a book lately published, for additional proof to the same effect. On much recommendation I immediately sent for a copy of the ''Dabistan'', in which I found many statements corroborative of the fact, that the eastern saints are all self-hypnotisers, adopting means essentially the same as those which I had recommended for similar purposes.<ref>Braid, J.

As he later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn as much as patients can throw themselves into the nervous sleep, and manifest all the usual phenomena of Mesmerism, through their own unaided efforts, as I have so repeatedly proved by causing them to maintain a steady fixed gaze at any point, concentrating their whole mental energies on the idea of the object looked at; or that the same may arise by the patient looking at the point of his own finger, or as the Magi of Persia and Yogi of India have practised for the last 2,400 years, for religious purposes, throwing themselves into their ecstatic trances by each maintaining a steady fixed gaze at the tip of his own nose; it is obvious that there is no need for an exoteric influence to produce the phenomena of Mesmerism. [\u2026] The great object in all these processes is to induce a habit of abstraction or concentration of attention, in which the subject is entirely absorbed with one idea, or train of ideas, whilst he is unconscious of, or indifferently conscious to, every other object, purpose, or action.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Braid, J. |url=http://wehypnosis.com/20/power-mind-over-body-james-braid/|title=The Power of the Mind over the Body: An Experimental Inquiry into the nature and acuse of the Phenomena attributed by Baron Reichenbach and others to a 'New Imponderable \u2013 Hypnosis explained' |journal=The Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal|volume=66|year=1846|pages=286\u2013311 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523162338/http://wehypnosis.com/20/power-mind-over-body-james-braid/|archivedate=23 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Avicenna ===\n[[Avicenna]] (980\u20131037), a Persian physician, documented the characteristics of the \"trance\" (Hypnotic Trance) state in 1027. At that time, hypnosis as a medical treatment was seldom used until the German doctor Franz Mesmer, reintroduced it in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|first=Catherine |last=Collin  |display-authors=etal|title=The psychology book|date=2011|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London|isbn=978-1-4053-9124-5|page=22}}</ref>\n\n=== Franz Mesmer ===\n[[Franz Mesmer]] (1734\u20131815) believed that there is a [[magnetic force]] or \"fluid\" called \"animal magnetism\" within the universe that influences the health of the human body. He experimented with magnets to impact this field in order to produce healing. By around 1774, he had concluded that the same effect could be created by passing the hands in front of the subject's body, later referred to as making \"Mesmeric passes\". The word \"mesmerize\", formed from the last name of Franz Mesmer, was intentionally used to separate practitioners of mesmerism from the various \"fluid\" and \"magnetic\" theories included within the label \"magnetism\".\n\nIn 1784, at the request of [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]], a Board of Inquiry started to investigate whether animal magnetism existed. Among the board members were founding father of modern chemistry [[Antoine Lavoisier]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and an expert in pain control, [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]]. They investigated the practices of a disaffected student of Mesmer, one Charles d'Eslon (1750\u20131786), and though they concluded that Mesmer's results were valid, their placebo-controlled experiments using d'Eslon's methods convinced them that mesmerism was most likely due to belief and imagination rather than to an invisible energy (\"animal magnetism\") transmitted from the body of the mesmerist.\n\nIn writing the majority opinion, Franklin said: \"This fellow Mesmer is not flowing anything from his hands that I can see. Therefore, this mesmerism must be a fraud.\" Mesmer left Paris and went back to Vienna to practise mesmerism.\n\n=== James Braid ===\n[[File:James Braid, portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|[[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]]]]Following the French committee's findings, [[Dugald Stewart]], an influential academic philosopher of the \"[[Scottish School of Common Sense]]\", encouraged physicians in his ''Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind'' (1818)<ref name=dugald>{{cite book|author=Dugald Stewart|title=Elements of the philosophy of the human mind|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJE6414.0001.001?view=toc|accessdate=1 October 2011|year=1818|publisher=Wells and Lilly|page=147}}</ref> to salvage elements of Mesmerism by replacing the supernatural theory of \"animal magnetism\" with a new interpretation based upon \"common sense\" laws of [[physiology]] and psychology. Braid quotes the following passage from Stewart:<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/magicwitchcraft00braigoog#page/n46/mode/2up Braid, J. ''Magic, Witchcraft, etc.'', 1852: 41\u201342.]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nIt appears to me, that the general conclusions established by Mesmer's practice, with respect to the physical effects of the principle of imagination (more particularly in cases where they co-operated together), are incomparably more curious than if he had actually demonstrated the existence of his boasted science [of \"animal magnetism\"]: nor can I see any good reason why a physician, who admits the efficacy of the moral [i.e., psychological] agents employed by Mesmer, should, in the exercise of his profession, scruple to copy whatever processes are necessary for subjecting them to his command, any more than that he should hesitate about employing a new physical agent, such as electricity or galvanism.<ref name=dugald />\n</blockquote>\n\nIn Braid's day, the Scottish School of Common Sense provided the dominant theories of academic psychology, and Braid refers to other philosophers within this tradition throughout his writings. Braid therefore revised the theory and practice of Mesmerism and developed his own method of hypnotism as a more rational and common sense alternative.\n\n<blockquote>\nIt may here be requisite for me to explain, that by the term Hypnotism, or Nervous Sleep, which frequently occurs in the following pages, I mean a peculiar condition of the nervous system, into which it may be thrown by artificial contrivance, and which differs, in several respects, from common sleep or the waking condition. I do not allege that this condition is induced through the transmission of a magnetic or occult influence from my body into that of my patients; nor do I profess, by my processes, to produce the higher [i.e., supernatural] phenomena of the Mesmerists. My pretensions are of a much more humble character, and are all consistent with generally admitted principles in physiological and psychological science. Hypnotism might therefore not inaptly be designated, Rational Mesmerism, in contra-distinction to the Transcendental Mesmerism of the Mesmerists.<ref>Braid, ''Observations on Trance or Human Hibernation'', 1850, 'Preface.'</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nDespite briefly toying with the name \"rational Mesmerism\", Braid ultimately chose to emphasise the unique aspects of his approach, carrying out informal experiments throughout his career in order to refute practices that invoked supernatural forces and demonstrating instead the role of ordinary physiological and psychological processes such as suggestion and focused attention in producing the observed effects.\n\nBraid worked very closely with his friend and ally the eminent physiologist Professor [[William Benjamin Carpenter]], an early neuro-psychologist who introduced the \"ideo-motor reflex\" theory of suggestion. Carpenter had observed instances of expectation and imagination apparently influencing involuntary muscle movement. A classic example of the ideo-motor principle in action is the so-called \"Chevreul pendulum\" (named after [[Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul]]). Chevreul claimed that divinatory pendulae were made to swing by unconscious muscle movements brought about by focused concentration alone.\n\nBraid soon assimilated Carpenter's observations into his own theory, realising that the effect of focusing attention was to enhance the ideo-motor reflex response. Braid extended Carpenter's theory to encompass the influence of the mind upon the body more generally, beyond the muscular system, and therefore referred to the \"ideo-dynamic\" response and coined the term \"psycho-physiology\" to refer to the study of general mind/body interaction.\n\nIn his later works, Braid reserved the term \"hypnotism\" for cases in which subjects entered a state of amnesia resembling sleep. For other cases, he spoke of a \"mono-ideodynamic\" principle to emphasise that the eye-fixation induction technique worked by narrowing the subject's attention to a single idea or train of thought (\"monoideism\"), which amplified the effect of the consequent \"dominant idea\" upon the subject's body by means of the ideo-dynamic principle.<ref>{{cite book|last=Braid|first=James|editor=Robertson, D.|title=The Discovery of Hypnosis: The Complete Writings of James Braid, the Father of Hypnotherapy\n|year=2009|publisher=UKCHH Ltd.|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Discovery_of_Hypnosis.html?id=Vs35STwQYQoC|isbn=978-0-9560570-0-6\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Hysteria vs. suggestion ===\nFor several decades Braid's work became more influential abroad than in his own country, except for a handful of followers, most notably Dr. [[John Milne Bramwell]]. The eminent neurologist Dr. [[George Miller Beard]] took Braid's theories to America. Meanwhile, his works were translated into German by [[William Thierry Preyer]], Professor of Physiology at [[Jena University]]. The psychiatrist [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]] subsequently continued German research, publishing ''Hypnotism'' in 1889. France became the focal point for the study of Braid's ideas after the eminent neurologist Dr. [[\u00c9tienne Eug\u00e8ne Azam]] translated Braid's last manuscript (''On Hypnotism'', 1860) into French and presented Braid's research to the French [[Academy of Sciences]].  At the request of Azam, [[Paul Broca]], and others, the [[French Academy of Science]], which had investigated Mesmerism in 1784, examined Braid's writings shortly after his death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Braid|first=James|editor=Robertson, D.|title=The Discovery of Hypnosis: The Complete Writings of James Braid, the Father of Hypnotherapy\n|year=2009|publisher=UKCHH Ltd.|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Discovery_of_Hypnosis.html?id=Vs35STwQYQoC|isbn=978-0-9560570-0-6\n}}</ref>\n\nAzam's enthusiasm for hypnotism influenced [[Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault]], a country doctor. [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] discovered Li\u00e9beault's enormously popular group hypnotherapy clinic and subsequently became an influential hypnotist. The study of hypnotism subsequently revolved around the fierce debate between Bernheim and [[Jean-Martin Charcot]], the two most influential figures in late 19th-century hypnotism.\n\nCharcot operated a clinic at the [[Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital]] (thus, known as [[The Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re School of Hypnosis|the \"Paris School\" or the \"Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re School\"]]), while Bernheim had a clinic in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] (known as the \"[[Nancy School]]\"). Charcot, who was influenced more by the Mesmerists, argued that hypnotism was an abnormal state of nervous functioning found only in certain [[Hysteria|hysterical]] women. He claimed that it manifested in a series of physical reactions that could be divided into distinct stages. Bernheim argued that anyone could be hypnotised, that it was an extension of normal psychological functioning, and that its effects were due to suggestion. After decades of debate, Bernheim's view dominated. Charcot's theory is now just a historical curiosity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Braid|first=James|editor=Robertson, D.|title=The Discovery of Hypnosis: The Complete Writings of James Braid, the Father of Hypnotherapy\n|year=2009|publisher=UKCHH Ltd.|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Discovery_of_Hypnosis.html?id=Vs35STwQYQoC|isbn=978-0-9560570-0-6\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Pierre Janet ===\n[[Pierre Janet]] (1859\u20131947) reported studies on a hypnotic subject in 1882. Charcot subsequently appointed him director of the psychological laboratory at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re in 1889, after Janet had completed his PhD, which dealt with psychological [[automatic behavior|automatism]]. In 1898, Janet was appointed psychology lecturer at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and in 1902 he became chair of experimental and comparative psychology at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Entry for Janet, Pierre}}</ref> Janet reconciled elements of his views with those of Bernheim and his followers, developing his own sophisticated hypnotic [[psychotherapy]] based upon the concept of psychological [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], which, at the turn of the century, rivalled Freud's attempt to provide a more comprehensive theory of psychotherapy.\n\n=== Sigmund Freud ===\n[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856\u20131939), the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], studied hypnotism at the Paris School and briefly visited the Nancy School.\n\nAt first, Freud was an enthusiastic proponent of hypnotherapy. He \"initially hypnotised patients and pressed on their foreheads to help them concentrate while attempting to recover (supposedly) repressed memories\",<ref>{{cite book|last=Braid|first=James|editor=Robertson, D.|title=The Discovery of Hypnosis: The Complete Writings of James Braid, the Father of Hypnotherapy|year=2009|publisher=UKCHH Ltd.|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Discovery_of_Hypnosis.html?id=Vs35STwQYQoC|isbn=978-0-9560570-0-6\n}}</ref> and he soon began to emphasise hypnotic regression and ab reaction ([[catharsis]]) as therapeutic methods. He wrote a favorable encyclopedia article on hypnotism, translated one of Bernheim's works into German, and published an influential series of case studies with his colleague Joseph Breuer entitled ''[[Studies on Hysteria]]'' (1895). This became the founding text of the subsequent tradition known as \"hypno-analysis\" or \"regression hypnotherapy\".\n\nHowever, Freud gradually abandoned hypnotism in favour of psychoanalysis, emphasizing free association and interpretation of the unconscious. Struggling with the great expense of time that psychoanalysis required, Freud later suggested that it might be combined with hypnotic suggestion to hasten the outcome of treatment, but that this would probably weaken the outcome: \"It is very probable, too, that the application of our therapy to numbers will compel us to alloy the pure gold of analysis plentifully with the copper of direct [hypnotic] suggestion.\"<ref>S. Freud, ''Lines of Advance in Psychoanalytic Therapy'', 1919</ref>\n\nOnly a handful of Freud's followers, however, were sufficiently qualified in hypnosis to attempt the synthesis. Their work had a limited influence on the hypno-therapeutic approaches now known variously as \"hypnotic regression\", \"hypnotic progression\", and \"hypnoanalysis\".\n\n=== \u00c9mile Cou\u00e9 ===\n[[File:\u00c9mile Cou\u00e9 3.jpg|thumb|200px|[[\u00c9mile Cou\u00e9]] developed [[autosuggestion]] as a psychological technique.]]\n{{further|Autosuggestion}}\n\n[[\u00c9mile Cou\u00e9]] (1857\u20131926) assisted Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault for around two years at Nancy. After practising for several months employing the \"hypnosis\" of Li\u00e9beault and Bernheim's Nancy School, he abandoned their approach altogether. Later, Cou\u00e9 developed a new approach (c.1901) based on Braid-style \"hypnotism\", direct hypnotic suggestion, and ego-strengthening which eventually became known as ''La m\u00e9thode Cou\u00e9''.<ref>See Yeates, 2016a, 2016b, and 2016c.</ref> According to [[Charles Baudouin]], Cou\u00e9 founded what became known as the New Nancy School, a loose collaboration of practitioners who taught and promoted his views.<ref>Baudouin continuously spoke of a \u201cNew Nancy School\u201d: e.g., Baudouin (1920), p.13.</ref><ref>It is significant that Cou\u00e9 never adopted Baudouin\u2019s designation \"New Nancy School\"; and, moreover, according to Glueck (1923, p.112), who visited Cou\u00e9 at Nancy in 1922, Cou\u00e9 was \u201crather annoyed\u201d with Baudouin\u2019s unauthorized characterization of his enterprise.</ref> Cou\u00e9's method did not emphasise \"sleep\" or deep relaxation, but instead focused upon [[autosuggestion]] involving a specific series of suggestion tests. Although Cou\u00e9 argued that he was no longer using hypnosis, followers such as [[Charles Baudouin]] viewed his approach as a form of light self-hypnosis. Cou\u00e9's method became a renowned [[self-help]] and psychotherapy technique, which contrasted with psychoanalysis and prefigured self-hypnosis and [[cognitive therapy]].\n\n=== Clark L. Hull ===\nThe next major development came from [[behavioural psychology]] in American university research. [[Clark L. Hull]] (1884\u20131952), an eminent American psychologist, published the first major compilation of laboratory studies on hypnosis, ''Hypnosis & Suggestibility'' (1933), in which he proved that hypnosis and sleep had nothing in common. Hull published many quantitative findings from hypnosis and suggestion experiments and encouraged research by mainstream psychologists. Hull's behavioural psychology interpretation of hypnosis, emphasising conditioned reflexes, rivalled the Freudian psycho-dynamic interpretation which emphasised unconscious transference.\n\n=== Dave Elman ===\nAlthough [[Dave Elman]] (1900\u20131967) was a noted radio host, comedian, and songwriter, he also made a name as a hypnotist. He led many courses for physicians, and in 1964 wrote the book ''Findings in Hypnosis'', later to be retitled ''Hypnotherapy'' (published by Westwood Publishing). Perhaps the most well-known aspect of Elman's legacy is his method of induction, which was originally fashioned for speed work and later adapted for the use of medical professionals.\n\n=== Milton Erickson ===\n[[Milton H. Erickson|Milton Erickson]] (1901\u20131980), the founding president of the [[American Society for Clinical Hypnosis]] and a fellow of the [[American Psychiatric Association]], the [[American Psychological Association]], and the [[American Psychopathological Association]], was one of the most influential post-war hypnotherapists. He wrote several books and journal articles on the subject. During the 1960s, Erickson popularized a new branch of hypnotherapy, known as [[Milton H. Erickson#Ericksonian therapy|Ericksonian therapy]], characterised primarily by indirect suggestion, \"metaphor\" (actually analogies), confusion techniques, and [[double bind]]s in place of formal hypnotic inductions. However, the difference between Erickson's methods and traditional hypnotism led contemporaries such as [[Andr\u00e9 Muller Weitzenhoffer|Andr\u00e9 Weitzenhoffer]] to question whether he was practising \"hypnosis\" at all, and his approach remains in question.\n\n<blockquote>\nErickson had no hesitation in presenting any suggested effect as being \"hypnosis\", whether or not the subject was in a hypnotic state. In fact, he was not hesitant in passing off behaviour that was dubiously hypnotic as being hypnotic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Andr\u00e9 Muller Weitzenhoffer|title=The practice of hypnotism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oeE64K1_SRUC&pg=PA419|accessdate=30 October 2011|year=2000|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-29790-1|pages=419\u2013}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Cognitive-behavioural ===\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, two factors contributed to the development of the cognitive-behavioural approach to hypnosis:\n# Cognitive and behavioural theories of the nature of hypnosis (influenced by the theories of Sarbin<ref>Sarbin, T.R. & Coe, W.C.

Ordinary non-hypnotic suggestion also caused reduction in pain compared to placebo, but was able to reduce pain in a wider range of subjects (both high and low suggestible) than hypnosis.

The technique is often used to increase motivation for a [[Dieting|diet]], to quit smoking, or to reduce stress. People who practise self-hypnosis sometimes require assistance; some people use devices known as [[mind machine]]s to assist in the process, whereas others use hypnotic recordings.\n\nSelf-hypnosis is claimed to help with stage fright, relaxation, and physical well-being.<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hr/sdtu/research/programme/sdsh/index.php \"Self-hypnosis as a skill for busy research workers.\"] London's Global University Human Resources. ucl.ac.uk.</ref>\n\n=== Stage hypnosis ===\n{{Main|Stage hypnosis}}\nStage hypnosis is a form of entertainment, traditionally employed in a club or theatre before an audience. Due to stage hypnotists' showmanship, many people believe that hypnosis is a form of mind control. Stage hypnotists typically attempt to hypnotise the entire audience and then select individuals who are \"under\" to come up on stage and perform embarrassing acts, while the audience watches. However, the effects of stage hypnosis are probably due to a combination of psychological factors, participant selection, suggestibility, physical manipulation, stagecraft, and trickery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yapko|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael D.

When Braid introduced the concept of hypnotism, he equivocated over the nature of the \"state\", sometimes describing it as a specific sleep-like neurological state comparable to animal hibernation or yogic meditation, while at other times he emphasised that hypnotism encompasses a number of different stages or states that are\nan extension of ordinary psychological and physiological processes. Overall, Braid appears to have moved from a more \"special state\" understanding of hypnotism toward a more complex \"nonstate\" orientation.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nState theorists interpret the effects of hypnotism as due primarily to a specific, abnormal, and uniform psychological or physiological state of some description, often referred to as \"hypnotic trance\" or an \"altered state of consciousness\". Nonstate theorists rejected the idea of hypnotic trance and interpret the effects of hypnotism as due to a combination of multiple task-specific factors derived from normal cognitive, behavioural, and social psychology, such as social role-perception and favorable motivation ([[Theodore R. Sarbin|Sarbin]]), active imagination and positive cognitive set (Barber), response expectancy (Kirsch), and the active use of task-specific subjective strategies ([[Nicholas Spanos|Spanos]]). The personality psychologist Robert White is often cited as providing one of the first nonstate definitions of hypnosis in a 1941 article:\n\n<blockquote>\nHypnotic behaviour is meaningful, goal-directed striving, its most general goal being to behave like a hypnotised person as this is continuously defined by the operator and understood by the client.<ref>{{cite journal|author=White, R.W.|title=A preface to the theory of hypnotism|journal= Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=36|pages= 477\u2013505|year= 1941|doi=10.1037/h0053844|issue=4}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nPut simply, it is often claimed that, whereas the older \"special state\" interpretation emphasises the difference between hypnosis and ordinary psychological processes, the \"nonstate\" interpretation emphasises their similarity.\n\nComparisons between hypnotised and non-hypnotised subjects suggest that, if a \"hypnotic trance\" does exist, it only accounts for a small proportion of the effects attributed to hypnotic suggestion, most of which can be replicated without hypnotic induction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n=== Hyper-suggestibility ===\nBraid can be taken to imply, in later writings, that hypnosis is largely a state of heightened suggestibility induced by expectation and focused attention. In particular, [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] became known as the leading proponent of the \"suggestion theory\" of hypnosis, at one point going so far as to declare that there is no hypnotic state, only heightened suggestibility. There is a general consensus that heightened suggestibility is an essential characteristic of hypnosis. In 1933, [[Clark L. Hull]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote> If a subject after submitting to the hypnotic procedure shows no genuine increase in susceptibility to any suggestions whatever, there seems no point in calling him hypnotised, regardless of how fully and readily he may respond to suggestions of lid-closure and other superficial sleeping behaviour.<ref>{{cite book|author=Clark Leonard Hull|title=Hypnosis and suggestibility: an experimental approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CknOAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 October 2011|year=1933|publisher=D. Appleton-Century company, inc.|page=392}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Conditioned inhibition ===\n[[Ivan Pavlov]] stated that hypnotic suggestion provided the best example of a conditioned reflex response in human beings; i.e., that responses to suggestions were learned associations triggered by the words used:\n\n<blockquote>Speech, on account of the whole preceding life of the adult, is connected up with all the internal and external stimuli which can reach the cortex, signaling all of them and replacing all of them, and therefore it can call forth all those reactions of the organism which are normally determined by the actual stimuli themselves. We can, therefore, regard \"suggestion\" as the most simple form of a typical reflex in man.<ref>Pavlov, quoted in Salter, ''What is Hypnosis''?, 1944: 23</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe also believed that hypnosis was a \"partial sleep\", meaning that a generalised inhibition of cortical functioning could be encouraged to spread throughout regions of the brain. He observed that the various degrees of hypnosis did not significantly differ physiologically from the waking state and hypnosis depended on insignificant changes of environmental stimuli. Pavlov also suggested that lower-brain-stem mechanisms were involved in hypnotic conditioning.<ref name=\"Pavlov\">{{Cite book |last=Pavlov |first=I.

Platonov. Soviet theories of hypnotism subsequently influenced the writings of Western behaviourally oriented hypnotherapists such as [[Andrew Salter]].\n\n=== Neuropsychology ===\nChanges in brain activity have been found in some studies of highly responsive hypnotic subjects.

They may indicate that suggestions genuinely produce changes in perception or experience that are not simply a result of imagination.

Throughout the study, both groups were consistent in their task results, achieving similar scores regardless of their mental state. During their first task session, before hypnosis, there were no significant differences in brain activity between the groups. But under hypnosis, Gruzelier found that the highly susceptible subjects showed significantly more brain activity in the [[anterior cingulate gyrus]] than the weakly susceptible subjects. This area of the brain has been shown to respond to errors and evaluate emotional outcomes. The highly susceptible group also showed much greater brain activity on the left side of the [[prefrontal cortex]] than the weakly susceptible group. This is an area involved with higher level cognitive processing and behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gosline|first=Anna|publisher=New Scientist|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6385|date=2004-09-10|title=Hypnosis really changes your mind|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Egner|first1=Jamieson|last2=Jamieson|first2=G|year=2005|title=Hypnosis decouples cognitive control from conflict monitoring processes of the frontal lobe|journal=NeuroImage|volume=27|issue=4|pages=969\u2013978|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.05.002|pmid=15964211|last3=Gruzelier|first3=J}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Dissociation ===\nPierre Janet originally developed the idea of ''dissociation of consciousness'' from his work with hysterical patients. He believed that hypnosis was an example of dissociation, whereby areas of an individual's behavioural control separate from ordinary awareness. Hypnosis would remove some control from the conscious mind, and the individual would respond with autonomic, reflexive behaviour. Weitzenhoffer describes hypnosis via this theory as \"dissociation of awareness from the majority of sensory and even strictly neural events taking place.\"<ref name=\"Weitzenhoffer, 2000\">{{Cite book |last=Weitzenhoffer |first= A. M. |title=''Hypnotism \u2013 An Objective Study in Suggestibility'' |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |year=1953 |isbn=1-258-02536-1}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Neodissociation ===\n[[Ernest Hilgard]], who developed the \"neodissociation\" theory of hypnotism, hypothesized that hypnosis causes the subjects to divide their consciousness voluntarily. One part responds to the hypnotist while the other retains awareness of reality. Hilgard made subjects take an ice water bath. None mentioned the water being cold or feeling pain. Hilgard then asked the subjects to lift their index finger if they felt pain and 70% of the subjects lifted their index finger. This showed that, even though the subjects were listening to the suggestive hypnotist, they still sensed the water's temperature.<ref>Baron's AP Psychology 2008</ref>\n\n=== Social role-taking theory ===\nThe main theorist who pioneered the influential role-taking theory of hypnotism was [[Theodore R. Sarbin|Theodore Sarbin]]. Sarbin argued that hypnotic responses were motivated attempts to fulfill the socially constructed roles of hypnotic subjects. This has led to the misconception that hypnotic subjects are simply \"faking\". However, Sarbin emphasised the difference between faking, in which there is little subjective identification with the role in question, and role-taking, in which the subject not only acts externally in accord with the role but also subjectively identifies with it to some degree, acting, thinking, and feeling \"as if\" they are hypnotised. Sarbin drew analogies between role-taking in hypnosis and role-taking in other areas such as [[method acting]], mental illness, and shamanic possession, etc. This interpretation of hypnosis is particularly relevant to understanding stage hypnosis, in which there is clearly strong peer pressure to comply with a socially constructed role by performing accordingly on a theatrical stage.\n\nHence, the ''social constructionism and role-taking theory'' of hypnosis suggests that individuals are enacting (as opposed to merely ''playing'') a role and that really there is no such thing as a hypnotic trance. A socially constructed relationship is built depending on how much [[rapport]] has been established between the \"hypnotist\" and the subject (see [[Hawthorne effect]], [[Pygmalion effect]], and [[placebo effect]]).\n\nPsychologists such as [[Robert A. Baker|Robert Baker]] and Graham Wagstaff claim that what we call hypnosis is actually a form of learned social behaviour, a complex hybrid of social compliance, relaxation, and suggestibility that can account for many esoteric behavioural manifestations.<ref name=\"Baker, 1990\">{{Cite book |last=Baker |first=Robert A. |year=1990 |title=''They Call It Hypnosis'' |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=0-87975-576-8}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Cognitive-behavioural theory ===\nBarber, Spanos, and Chaves (1974) proposed a nonstate \"cognitive-behavioural\" theory of hypnosis, similar in some respects to Sarbin's social role-taking theory and building upon the earlier research of Barber. On this model, hypnosis is explained as an extension of ordinary psychological processes like imagination, relaxation, expectation, social compliance, etc. In particular, Barber argued that responses to hypnotic suggestions were mediated by a \"positive cognitive set\" consisting of positive expectations, attitudes, and motivation. Daniel Araoz subsequently coined the acronym \"TEAM\" to symbolise the subject's orientation to hypnosis in terms of \"trust\", \"expectation\", \"attitude\", and \"motivation\".<ref name=\"Barber, Spanos 1974\" />\n\nBarber et al. noted that similar factors appeared to mediate the response both to hypnotism and to cognitive behavioural therapy, in particular systematic desensitization.<ref name=\"Barber, Spanos 1974\" /> Hence, research and clinical practice inspired by their interpretation has led to growing interest in the relationship between hypnotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy.<ref name=\"Chapman\" />{{rp|105}}<ref name=\"Bolocofsky\" />\n\n=== Information theory ===\nAn approach loosely based on [[information theory]] uses a brain-as-computer model. In adaptive systems, [[feedback]] increases the [[signal-to-noise ratio]], which may converge towards a steady state. Increasing the signal-to-noise ratio enables messages to be more clearly received. The hypnotist's object is to use techniques to reduce interference and increase the receptability of specific messages (suggestions).<ref>Kroger, William S.

Hypnotic phenomena thus involve not only increased or decreased activity of particular subsystems, but also their interaction.

It origins date back to 1952 when a group of dentists set up the \u2018British Society of Dental Hypnosis\u2019. Shortly after, a group of sympathetic medical practitioners merged with this fast-evolving organisation to form \u2018The Dental and Medical Society for the Study of Hypnosis\u2019; and, in 1968, after various statutory amendments had taken place, the \u2018British Society of Medical and Dental Hypnosis\u2019 (BSMDH) was formed. This society always had close links with the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] and many of its members were involved in setting up a hypnosis section at this centre of medical research in London. And, in 1978, under the presidency of David Waxman, the Section of Medical and Dental Hypnosis was formed. A second society, the British Society of Experimental and Clinical Hypnosis (BSECH), was also set up a year before, in 1977, and this consisted of psychologists, doctors and dentists with an interest in hypnosis theory and practice. In 2007, the two societies merged to form the \u2018British Society of Clinical and Academic Hypnosis\u2019 (BSCAH). This society only trains health professionals and is interested in furthering research into clinical hypnosis.\n\nThe [[American Society of Clinical Hypnosis]] (ASCH) is unique among organizations for professionals using hypnosis because members must be licensed healthcare workers with graduate degrees. As an interdisciplinary organization, ASCH not only provides a classroom to teach professionals how to use hypnosis as a tool in their practice, it provides professionals with a community of experts from different disciplines. The ASCH's missions statement is to provide and encourage education programs to further, in every ethical way, the knowledge, understanding, and application of hypnosis in health care; to encourage research and scientific publication in the field of hypnosis; to promote the further recognition and acceptance of hypnosis as an important tool in clinical health care and focus for scientific research; to cooperate with other professional societies that share mutual goals, ethics and interests; and to provide a professional community for those clinicians and researchers who use hypnosis in their work. The ASCH also publishes the [http://www.asch.net/Public/AmericanJournalofClinicalHypnosis/tabid/162/Default.aspx American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis]\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of hypnotists]] and [[List of fictional hypnotists]]\n\n=== Historical figures ===\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Alfred Binet]]\n* [[Emile Dantinne]]\n* [[George Estabrooks]]\n* [[Abb\u00e9 Faria]]\n* [[Ainslie Meares]]\n* [[Julian Ochorowicz]]\n* [[Otto Georg Wetterstrand]]\n* [[John Elliotson]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Modern researchers ===\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Etzel Carde\u00f1a]]\n* [[Alan Gauld]]\n* [[Jack Stanley Gibson]]\n*[[Ernest Hilgard]] \n* [[Ainslie Meares]]\n* [[Dylan Morgan]]\n* [[Michel Weber]]<ref>[[Michel Weber]] is working on a Whiteheadian interpretation of hypnotic phenomena: see his \u00ab [https://www.academia.edu/869316/_Hypnosis_Panpsychism_in_Action_2008_ Hypnosis: Panpsychism in Action] \u00bb, in Michel Weber and William Desmond, Jr. (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/6359521/Michel_Weber_and_Will_Desmond_eds._Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought_2008 Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought X1 & X2, 2008, I, pp. 15-38, 395-414 ; cf. \u00ab [https://www.academia.edu/5679705/_Syntonie_ou_agencement_ethnopsychiatrique_2013_ Syntonie ou agencement ethnopsychiatrique ?] \u00bb, Michel Weber et Vincent Berne (sous la direction de), ''[https://www.academia.edu/5562658/Michel_Weber_et_Vincent_Berne_sous_la_direction_de_Chromatikon_IX._Annales_de_la_philosophie_en_proc%C3%A8s_Yearbook_of_Philosophy_in_Process_2013 Chromatikon IX.

Baseball researcher [[Bill James]] credits Chadwick's creation of the box score with his interest in the game, but he criticized Chadwick's omission of the [[base on balls|walk]] from calculation of a player's [[batting average]]: \"\"What they failed to understand is that actually the batter has as much or a little more to do with when the walk occurs as the pitcher does.

He felt that batting average was the best representation of a batter's offensive skills. He initially scored [[base on balls|walks]] as errors charged to the pitcher. Walks did not exist in cricket and upon learning about them in baseball, he felt that they did not have anything to do with offensive skill. He later removed walks entirely from baseball statistics.<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Michael|title=Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game|date=2004|publisher=[[W. W.

He is also noted as believing fielding range to be a superior skill to avoiding errors.\n\n===Journalistic style===\nThe following description of a game was written by Henry Chadwick and appeared in his ''Base Ball Memoranda''.  It is typical of his style of sports journalism, and that of his time:\n\n<blockquote>A Base Ball tourney had been held in Chicago on July 4, 1867, in which the Excelsiors of that city and the Forest City Club, of Rockford, had been the leading contestants.  The former had defeated the Forest City nine in two games, by the very close scores of 45\u201341 in one, and 28\u201325 in another, when the Forest Citys were invited to meet the Nationals at Chicago on July 25, a day which proved the most notable of the tour.  The contest took place at Dexter Park, before a vast crowd of spectators, the majority of whom looked to see the Nationals have almost a walk-over.  In the game [[Albert Spalding|A. G. Spalding]] was pitcher and [[Ross Barnes]] shortstop for the Forest City nine; these two afterwards becoming famous as star players of the Boston professional team of the early seventies.  Williams was pitcher for the Nationals and Frank Norton catcher.  The Nationals took the lead in the first innings by 3 to 2; but in the next two innings they added but five runs to their score, while the Forest Citys added thirteen to theirs, thereby taking the lead by a score of fifteen to eight, to the great surprise of the crowd and the delight of the Rockfords.  The Nationals tried hard to recover the lost ground.  The final result, however, was the success of the Forest Citys by a score of 29 to 23 in a nine innings game, twice interrupted by rain.</blockquote>\n\n==Later life==\nLate in life, Chadwick continued editing the ''Spalding Base Ball Guides'' and producing a column for the ''[[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]''.<ref name=Schiff215/> In late 1905, he wrote the editor of ''The New York Times'' to propose widening of the baseball bat to overcome the advantage that pitchers had established in the game.

[[Tertiary education]] at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as [[further education]] or [[continuing education]] as distinct from higher education. The right of access to higher education is mentioned in a number of [[international human rights instruments]]. The [[United Nations|UN]] [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] of 1966 declares, in Article 13, that \"higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education\".

[[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]'s educational model goes beyond vocational training. In a letter to the Prussian king, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|There are undeniably certain kinds of knowledge that must be of a general nature and, more importantly, a certain cultivation of the mind and character that nobody can afford to be without. People obviously cannot be good craftworkers, merchants, soldiers or businessmen unless, regardless of their occupation, they are good, upstanding and \u2013 according to their condition \u2013 well-informed human beings and citizens. If this basis is laid through schooling, vocational skills are easily acquired later on, and a person is always free to move from one occupation to another, as so often happens in life.<ref>As quoted in Profiles of educators: Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767\u20131835) by Karl-Heinz G\u00fcnther (1988), {{DOI|10.1007/BF02192965}}</ref>}}\n\nThe philosopher [[Julian Nida-R\u00fcmelin]] criticized discrepancies between Humboldt's ideals and the contemporary European education policy, which narrowly understands education as a preparation for the labor market, and argued that we need to decide between [[McKinsey & Company|McKinsey]] and Humboldt.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2009/45/Bachelor-Kritik|title=Bologna-Prozess: Die Chance zum Kompromiss ist da|last=Nida-R\u00fcmelin|first=Julian|date=29 October 2009|work=[[Die Zeit]]|language=German|access-date=29 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Entrance standards: reading, mathematics, and writing==\n\nDemonstrated ability in reading, mathematics, and writing, as typically measured in the United States by the [[SAT]] or similar tests such as the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], have often replaced colleges' individual entrance exams, and is often required for admission to higher education.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/education/edlife/26guidance-t.html|title=The Other Side of 'Test Optional'|last=O'Shaughnessy|first=Lynn|date=26 July 2009|work=The New York Times|page=6|accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> There is some question as to whether advanced mathematical skills or talent are in fact necessary for fields such as history, English, philosophy, or art.<ref name=NYT72812>{{cite news|title=Is Algebra Necessary?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/opinion/sunday/is-algebra-necessary.html|accessdate=July 29, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 28, 2012|author=Andrew Hacker|authorlink=Andrew Hacker}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===General===\nThe general higher education and training that takes place in a [[university]], [[college]], or [[Institute of technology]] usually includes significant [[theory|theoretical]] and abstract elements, as well as applied aspects (although limited offerings of [[internship]]s or [[Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)|SURF]] programs attempt to provide practical applications). In contrast, the vocational higher education and training that takes place at [[vocational university|vocational universities and schools]] usually concentrates on [[practice (learning method)|practical applications]], with very little theory.\n\nIn addition, [[professional]]-level education is always included within Higher Education, and usually in [[graduate school]]s since many [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] are both vocationally, professionally, and theoretically/research oriented, such as in the [[law]], [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], and [[veterinary medicine]]. A basic requirement for entry into these graduate-level programs is almost always a bachelor's degree, although [[alternative pathways in education|alternative means]] of obtaining entry into such programs may be available at some universities. Requirements for admission to such high-level graduate programs is extremely competitive, and admitted students are expected to perform well.\n\n[[File:US household wealth by education.png|thumb|Mean financial wealth of U.S. families by education of the head of household, 1989-2010]]\n[[File:US household income by education.png|thumb|Mean income of U.S. families by education of the head of household, 1989-2010]]\n\nWhen employers in any profession consider hiring a college graduate, they are looking for evidence of [[critical thinking]], [[analytical reasoning]] skills, [[teamwork]]ing skills, [[information literacy]], [[Ethics|ethical]] judgment, [[decision-making]] skills, [[Communication studies|communication skills]] (using both text and speech), [[problem solving]] skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences.

Medical doctors and lawyers are generally the highest paid workers, and have among the lowest unemployment rates. Among undergraduate fields of study, science, technology, engineering, math, and business generally offer the highest wages and best chances of employment, while education, communication, and liberal arts degrees generally offer lower wages and a lower likelihood of employment.<ref name=Simkovic /><ref>{{cite press release| title =The Economic Value of College Majors| publisher =Georgetown University| date =May 2015| url =https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/valueofcollegemajors/| accessdate =17 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Liberal arts ====\n{{Main|Liberal arts college}}\n\nAcademic areas that are included within the [[liberal arts]] include [[environmental science]], [[great books]], [[history]], [[language]]s including English, [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[mathematics]], [[Music education|music]], [[philosophy]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[religious studies]], [[science]], [[sociology]] and [[Drama school|theater]].\n\n==== Engineering ====\n{{Main|Engineering college}}\n\nTeaching engineering is teaching the application of scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to design, build, maintain, and improve structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes. It may encompass using insights to conceive, model and scale an appropriate solution to a problem or objective. The discipline of engineering is extremely broad, and encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of technology and types of application. Engineering disciplines include [[aerospace]], [[biological]], [[Civil engineering|civil]], [[chemical]], [[Computer engineering|computer]], [[electrical]], [[Industrial engineering|industrial]], and [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]].\n\n====Performing arts====\n{{Main|Performing arts education}}\n\nThe [[performing arts]] differ from the [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]], insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and presence as a medium; the latter uses materials such as clay, metal or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create a [[work of art]].\n\nPerforming arts institutions include [[:Category:Circus schools|circus schools]], [[Dance studio|dance schools]], [[drama school]]s and [[music school]]s.\n\n====Plastic or visual arts====\n{{Main|Art education|Art school}}\n\nThe [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]] are a class of [[Art#Art forms|art forms]], that involve the use of materials, that can be moulded or modulated in some way, often in three dimensions. Examples are [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[drawing]].\n\nHigher educational institutions in these arts include [[film school]]s and [[List of art schools|art schools]].\n\n===Vocational===\n{{Main|Vocational university|Vocational school|Technical school}}\n\nHigher vocational education and training takes place at the non-university tertiary level. Such education combines teaching of both practical skills and theoretical expertise. Higher education differs from other forms of post-secondary education such as that offered by institutions of [[vocational education]], which are more colloquially known as [[vocational school|trade schools]]. Higher vocational education might be contrasted with education in a usually broader [[science|scientific]] field, which might concentrate on [[theory]] and abstract [[concept]]ual knowledge.\n\n===Professional higher education===\nThis describes a distinct form of higher education that offers a particularly intense integration with the world of work in all its aspects (including teaching, learning, research and governance) and at all levels of the overarching Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area. Its function is to diversify learning opportunities, enhance employability, offer qualifications and stimulate innovation, for the benefit of learners and society.\n\nThe intensity of integration with the world of work (which includes enterprise, civil society and the public sector) is manifested by a strong focus on application of learning. This approach involves combining phases of work and study, a concern for employability, cooperation with employers, the use of practice-relevant knowledge and use-inspired research.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://haphe.eurashe.eu|title = Harmonising Approaches to Professional Higher Education in Europe|date = 2013|accessdate = 2014-10-17|website = Harmonising Approaches to Professional Higher Education in Europe|publisher = EURASHE|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nExamples of providers of professional higher education may include graduate colleges of [[architecture]], [[Business school|business]], [[Journalism school|journalism]], [[Law school|law]], [[Library school|library science]], [[optometry]], [[Pharmacy school|pharmacy]], [[Public policy school|public policy]], [[Medical school|human medicine]], [[Engineering education|professional engineering]], [[Podiatric medical school|podiatric medicine]], [[Dental school|scientific dentistry]], [[K-12 education]], and [[Veterinary school|veterinary medicine]].\n\n===Statistics===\nA report titled 'Education at a Glance 2014' published by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] on 9 September 2014, revealed that by 2014, 84 percent of young people were completing upper secondary education over their lifetimes, in high-income countries. Tertiary-educated individuals were earning twice as much as median workers. In contrast to historical trends in education, young women were more likely to complete upper secondary education than young men.  Additionally, access to education was expanding and growth in the number of people receiving university education was rising sharply. By 2014, close to 40 percent of people aged 25\u201334 (and around 25 percent of those aged 55\u201364), were being educated at university.<ref name=\"ReportOECD\">{{cite news|title=Higher levels of education paying off for young, says OECD|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/eag.htm |date=September 2014 |accessdate=September 11, 2014|author=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]}}</ref>\n\n==Recognition of studies==\nThe [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]] stipulates that degrees and periods of study must be recognised in all of the Signatory Parties of the Convention.\n\n==As employers==\n[[File:2015-04-23 Kirylo Cope DSC0072.jpg|upright=1.1|right|thumb|University governance generally involves input from the Faculty.

Cope, president of the [[LSU]] Faculty Senate and president of the Association of Louisiana Faculty Senates, during a 2015 panel presentation in [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] on university funding issues for [[Fiscal Year]] 2016.]]\nUniversities may employ a number of people. Depending on the funding, a university typically hires one teacher per 3\u201325 students. According to the ideal of research-university, the university teaching staff is actively involved in the research of the institution. In addition, the university usually also has dedicated research staff and a considerable support staff. Typically to work in higher education as a member of the academic [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]], a candidate must first obtain a doctorate in an academic field, although some lower teaching positions require only a master's degree.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nMost of the administrative staff works in different administrative sections, such as [[Student Affairs]].{{citation needed|reason=This appears 'top of the head'. Really needs citation and more university 'sections'.|date=November 2011}} In addition, there may be central support units, such as a university [[library]] which have a dedicated staff.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cornell University Library Staff Web|url=http://staffweb.library.cornell.edu/|accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe professional field involving the collection, analysis, and reporting of higher education data is called [[institutional research]]. Professionals in this field can be found at locations in addition to universities, e.g. state educational departments.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nPost-secondary institutions also employ graduate students in various assistantship roles.  In the US, close to 50% of graduate students are employed as graduate assistants at some point.  These apprenticeship-like positions provide opportunities for students to gain experience in, and exposure to, professional roles in exchange for funding of their academic programs.<ref>Haley, K., Hephner LaBanc, B., & Koutas, P. (2011). New school, new job, new life: Transitions of graduate assistants in student affairs.

However this has sparked some debate in recent years as some advocates say that a degree is not what it was once worth to employers. To clarify some advocates say that the financial costs that universities require from their students  has gone up so dramatically that it is leaving many students in debt of loans of an average of $37,172<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/|title=U.S. Student Loan Debt Statistics for 2017 {{!}} Student Loan Hero|work=Student Loan Hero|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-US}}</ref> compared to 2000, where the average debt students graduated with was $16,928.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/03/08/college/q_studentdebt/|title=Student debt increasingly unmanagable - Mar. 8, 2002|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2017-12-09}}</ref> In the United States there is an estimated 44 million Americans with a combined $1.3 trillion student loan debt.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2017/02/21/student-loan-debt-statistics-2017/#50c1f4f05dab|title=Student Loan Debt In 2017: A $1.3 Trillion Crisis|last=Friedman|first=Zack|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en}}</ref> Advocates advise parents to not send their children to college unless these children are committed to pursuing their future education.

She was sworn in as mayor in November 2000, replacing [[Jimmie R. Yee]], and served until December 2008, when she was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nHeather Fargo grew up in Davis, Santa Maria, and Stockton, CA. She graduated from AA Stagg High School. She received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in Environmental Planning and Management from the [[University of California, Davis]] in 1975. In 1981, Fargo earned a Certificate of Completion from the Revenue Sources Management School in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. She also completed the State and Local Government Executive Program at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1991.\n\n==City Council Years==\nHeather Fargo was first elected to the [[Sacramento City Council]] in 1989 to a five-year term as Sacramento was transitioning to even year citywide elections. Fargo represented District One which includes [[Downtown Sacramento|Downtown]] and [[Natomas]]. In the September primary, she came in second place to businesswoman Kate Karpilow but beat future City Councilman Ray Tretheway who came in third place and incumbent David Shore who came in fourth place. However, Fargo came back to beat Karpilow in November.\n\nUpon Grantland Johnson's resignation from the County Board of Supervisors in 1994, Fargo decided to run for the Board. In that election, she faced attorney and community activist Roger Dickinson. In a closely fought election, Dickinson narrowly beat Fargo. After that loss she was re-elected in 1994 and 1998. While serving on the city council, (prior to becoming Mayor full-time), she was employed as a manager of the California State Parks Volunteer Program.\n\n==2000 Mayoral Campaign==\nUpon the sudden death in November 1999 of Mayor [[Joe Serna, Jr.]], Land Park city councilman Jimmie Yee became the acting mayor. Several candidates announced their intentions to run. Other than Fargo, three other council members were also seeking the mayorship. North Sacramento city councilman Rob Kerth who represented an area immediately adjacent to Fargo's also decided to run. In addition, [[Sacramento City Council#Steve Cohn|Steve Cohn]], the city councilman for [[East Sacramento, Sacramento, California|East Sacramento]] ran along with [[Sacramento City Council#Robbie Waters|Robbie Waters]] who represents the Pocket and Greenhaven areas decided to run along with several lesser known candidates that included businessman and attorney Joe Genshlea and community activist Julie Padilla. Fargo, who won 22% of the vote in the primary and Kerth who won 20% of the vote made it into the November runoff, where Fargo was elected with just 53% of the vote. In winning, Fargo became the first Latina mayor of an American city.<ref>David Goldfield, ''Encyclopedia of American Cities'', v.1. Thousand Oaks: Sage, 2007, p. 881. 9780761928843</ref>\n\n==2004 Mayoral Campaign==\nFargo did not face as stiff competition in her 2004 re-election. Her main opponent was Ross W. Relles, Jr., a businessman. Other candidates were Deputy Attorney General Mark Soble and Lorenzo Patino Law School President Leonard Padilla. Virtually unopposed against candidates far less funded, Fargo won solidly in the primary election, thus no runoff was necessary.\n\n==2008 Mayoral Campaign==\nThe primary election for Mayor took place on 3 June 2008. Fargo received 39% of the vote, while former [[NBA]] star and Sacramento native [[Kevin Johnson]] received 46% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |author = Mary Lynne Vellinga |title = Johnson leads mayor's race |work = [[Sacramento Bee]] |date= 2008-06-04 |url = http://www.sacbee.com/734/story/987573.html |accessdate = 2008-06-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080607021617/http://www.sacbee.com/734/story/987573.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-07}}</ref> Since neither received a majority of the votes, a run off election was scheduled for November 2008, where she was defeated by a margin of 58% to 42%.\n\nDuring the primary election campaign, Fargo initially claimed that she had the support of all the city councilmembers.

Often [[Zeus]] (or [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]) was considered the supreme, all-powerful and all-knowing, king and father of the Olympian gods. According to Maijastina Kahlos \"monotheism was pervasive in the educated circles in Late Antiquity\" and \"all divinities were interpreted as aspects, particles or epithets of one supreme God\".<ref name =\"maij\">Maijastina Kahlos, ''Debate and Dialogue: Christian and Pagan Cultures C. 360-430'', Ashgate Publishing, 2007, p.145; p.160</ref> [[Maximus Tyrius]] (2nd century A.D.) stated: \"In such a mighty contest, sedition and discord, you will see one according law and assertion in all the earth, that there is one god, the king and father of all things, and many gods, sons of god, ruling together with him.\"<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 11th edition, Maximus Tryius.</ref>\n\nThe [[Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Plotinus]] taught that above the gods of traditional belief was \"The One\",<ref name =\"maij\"/> and polytheist<ref>Maijastina Kahlos, Debate and Dialogue: Christian and Pagan Cultures C. 360-430, Ashgate Publishing, 2007, P.70</ref> grammarian Maximus of [[Madauros]] even stated that only a madman would deny the existence of the supreme God.<ref name =\"maij\"/>\n\n==Canaanite religion and early Judaism==\n[[Rabbinical Judaism]] as it developed in [[Late Antiquity]] is emphatically monotheistic. However, its predecessor\u2014the various schools of [[Hellenistic Judaism]] and [[Second Temple Judaism]], and especially the cult of [[Yahweh]] as it was practiced in  [[ancient Israel and Judah]] during the 8th and 7th centuries BC\u2014have been described as henotheistic.\n\nFor example, the [[Moab]]ites worshipped the god [[Chemosh]], the [[Edom]]ites, [[Qaus]], both of whom were part of the greater [[Canaan]]ite pantheon, headed by the chief god, [[El (Canaanite god)|El]]. The Canaanite pantheon consisted of El and [[Asherah]] as the chief deities, with 70 sons who were said to rule over each of the nations of the earth. These sons were each worshiped within a specific region. [[Kurt Noll]] states that \"the Bible preserves a tradition that Yahweh used to 'live' in the south, in the land of Edom\" and that the original god of Israel was [[El Shaddai]].<ref name = \"noll\">[[Kurt Noll|K. L. Noll]] ''Canaan and Israel in Antiquity: An Introduction'', Continuum, 2002, p.123</ref>\n\nSeveral Biblical stories{{Which|date=April 2016}} allude to the belief that the Canaanite gods all existed and were thought{{By whom|date=April 2016}} to possess the most power in the lands by the people who worshiped them and their sacred objects; their power was believed to be real and could be invoked by the people who patronized them. There are numerous accounts{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} of surrounding nations of Israel showing fear or reverence for the Israelite God despite their continued polytheistic practices.<ref>David Bridger, Samuel Wolk et al., ''The New Jewish Encyclopedia'', Behrman House, 1976, pp.326-7</ref> For instance, in 1 Samuel 4, the [[Philistines]] fret before the second battle of [[Aphek (biblical)|Aphek]] when they learn that the Israelites are bearing the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and therefore Yahweh, into battle. The Israelites were forbidden<ref>[http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=exodus+20:1-20:17&version=nrsv Exodus Chapter 20 Verse 3]</ref> to worship other deities, but according to some interpretations{{Which|date=April 2016}} of the Bible, they were not fully monotheistic before the [[Babylonian captivity]].

Smith, ''The Early History of God: Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israel'', Eerdmans Publishing, 2002, pp.58, 183</ref> Smith argues that Yahweh underwent a process of merging with El and that acceptance of cults of [[Asherah]] was common in the period of the Judges.<ref name = \"smith\"/> 2 Kings 3:27 has been interpreted as describing a human sacrifice in Moab that led the invading Israelite army to fear the power of Chemosh.<ref name = \"boyd\">Gregory A.

Hedwig's brother was Bishop {{Interlanguage link multi|Ekbert of Bamberg|de|3=Ekbert von Andechs-Meranien}}, Count of Andechs-Meranien. Another brother was [[Berthold (patriarch of Aquileia)|Berthold]], Archbishop of Kalocsa und Patriarch of Aquileia. \nThrough her sister Gertrude, she was the aunt of Saint [[Elizabeth of Hungary]].\n\n===Duchess consort===\nAt the age of twelve, Hedwig married [[Henry I the Bearded]], son and heir of the [[Silesian Piasts|Piast]] duke [[Boles\u0142aw I the Tall|Boleslaus the Tall]] of [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesia]]. As soon as Henry succeeded his father in 1201, he had to struggle with his [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] relatives, at first with his uncle Duke [[Mieszko IV Tanglefoot]] who immediately seized the Upper Silesian [[Duchy of Opole]]. In 1206 Henry and his cousin Duke [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Spindleshanks]] of [[Greater Poland]] agreed to swap the Silesian [[Lubusz Land]] against the [[Kalisz]] region, which met with fierce protest by W\u0142adys\u0142aw's III nephew [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic]]. When Henry went to [[G\u0105sawa]] in 1227 to meet his Piast cousins, he narrowly saved his life, while High Duke [[Leszek I the White]] was killed by the men of the [[Pomerelia]]n Duke [[Swietopelk II, Duke of Pomerania|Swietopelk II]], instigated by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic.\n\n[[File:Sw Jadwiga godzi Henryka Brodatego z Konradem Mazowieckim.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Hedwig intercedes between Henry and Konrad, 19th century depiction]]\n\nThe next year Henry's ally [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Spindleshanks]] succeeded Leszek I as [[Seniorate Province|High Duke]]; however as he was still contested by his nephew in Greater Poland, he made Henry his governor at [[Krak\u00f3w]], whereby the Silesian duke once again became entangled in the dispute over the [[Seniorate Province]]. In 1229 he was captured and arrested at [[P\u0142ock]] Castle by rivaling Duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]]. Hedwig proceeded to P\u0142ock pleading for Henry and was able to have him released.\n\nHer actions promoted the reign of her husband: Upon the death of the Polish High Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Spindleshanks in 1231, Henry also became Duke of [[Greater Poland]] and the next year prevailed as High Duke at Krak\u00f3w. He thereby was the first of the Silesian Piast descendants of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile]] to gain the rule over Silesia and the Seniorate Province in accord with the 1138 [[Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty]].\n\n===Widow===\nIn 1238, upon his death, Henry was buried at a [[Cistercian]] monastery of nuns, [[Sanctuary of St. Jadwiga in Trzebnica|Trzebnica Abbey]] (''Kloster Trebnitz''), which he had established in 1202 at Hedwig's request.

The widow however had to witness the killing of her son, vainly awaiting the support of Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], during the [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|Mongol invasion of Poland]] at the [[Battle of Legnica]] (''Wahlstatt'') in 1241. The hopes for a re-united Poland were lost and even Silesia fragmented into numerous Piast [[Duchies of Silesia|duchies]] under Henry II's sons.

It arose as a spiritual revival movement in contemporary [[Western Ukraine]] during the [[18th century]], and spread rapidly throughout [[Eastern Europe]]. Today, most affiliates reside in [[Israel]] and the [[United States]]. Israel Ben Eliezer, the \"[[Baal Shem Tov]]\", is regarded as its founding father, and his disciples developed and disseminated it. Present-day Hasidism is a sub-group within [[Haredi Judaism|Ultra-Orthodox (\"Haredi\") Judaism]], and is noted for its religious conservatism and social seclusion. Its members adhere closely both to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish practice]] \u2013 with the movement's own unique emphases \u2013 and the traditions of Eastern European Jews, so much so that many of the latter, including various special styles of dress and the use of the [[Yiddish language]], are nowadays associated almost exclusively with Hasidism.\n\nHasidic thought draws heavily on [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], and, to an extent, is a popularization of it. Teachings emphasize God's [[immanence]] in the universe, the need to cleave and be one with Him at all times, the devotional aspect of religious practice, and the spiritual dimension of corporeality and mundane acts. ''Hasidim'', the adherents of Hasidism, are organized in [[Hasidic dynasty|independent sects known as \"courts\" or dynasties]], each headed by its own hereditary leader, a ''[[Rebbe]]''. Reverence and submission to the ''Rebbe'' are key tenets, as he is considered a spiritual authority with whom the follower must bond to gain closeness to God. The various \"courts\" share basic convictions, but operate apart, and possess unique traits and customs. Affiliation is often retained in families for generations, and being Hasidic is as much a sociological factor \u2013 entailing, as it does, birth into a specific community and allegiance to a dynasty of ''Rebbe''s \u2013 as it is a purely religious one. There are several \"courts\" with many thousands of member households each, and hundreds of smaller ones. As of 2016, there were over 130,000 Hasidic households worldwide, about 5% of the global Jewish population.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe [[Hasid (term)|terms ''hasid'']] and ''hasidut'', meaning \"pietist\" and \"piety\", have a long history in Judaism. The [[Talmud]] and other old sources refer to the \"Pietists of Old\" (''Hasidim ha-Rishonim'') who would contemplate an entire hour in preparation for prayer. The phrase denoted extremely devoted individuals who not only observed the Law to its letter, but performed good deeds even beyond it. [[Adam]] himself is honored with the title in [[Eruvin (Talmud)|tractate Eruvin]] 18b by [[Rabbi Meir]]: \"Adam was a great ''hasid'', having fasted for 130 years.\" The first to adopt the epithet collectively were apparently the ''hasidim'' in [[Second Temple period]] [[Judea]], known as [[Hasideans]] after the Greek rendering of their name, who perhaps served as the model for those mentioned in the Talmud. The title continued to be applied as an honorific for the exceptionally devout. In 12th-century [[Rhineland]], or ''[[Ashkenaz]]'' in Jewish parlance, another prominent school of ascetics named themselves ''hasidim''; to distinguish them from the rest, later research employed the term [[Ashkenazi Hasidim]]. In the 16th century, when [[Kabbalah]] spread, the title also became associated with it. [[Jacob ben Hayyim Zemah]] wrote in his glossa on [[Isaac Luria]]'s version of the [[Shulchan Aruch]] that, \"One who wishes to tap the hidden wisdom, must conduct himself in the manner of the Pious.\"\n\nThe movement founded by [[Israel Ben Eliezer]] in the 18th century adopted the term ''hasidim'' in the original connotation. But when the sect grew and developed specific attributes, from the 1770s, the names gradually acquired a new meaning. Its common adherents, belonging to groups each headed by a spiritual leader, were henceforth known as Hasidim. The transformation was slow: The movement was at first referred to as \"New Hasidism\" by outsiders (as recalled in the autobiography of [[Salomon Maimon]]) to separate it from the old one, and its enemies derisively mocked its members as ''Mithasdim'', \"[those who] pretend [to be] ''hasidim''\". Yet, eventually, the young sect gained such a mass following that the old connotation was sidelined. In popular discourse, at least, Hasid came to denote someone who follows a religious teacher from the movement. It also entered [[Modern Hebrew]] as such, meaning \"adherent\" or \"disciple\". One was not merely a ''hasid'' anymore, observed historian David Assaf, but a Hasid of someone or some dynasty in particular. This linguistic transformation paralleled that of the word ''[[tzaddik]]'', \"righteous\", which the Hasidic leaders adopted for themselves \u2013 though they are known colloquially as ''Rebbe''s or by the honorific ''Admor''. Originally denoting an observant, moral person, in Hasidic literature ''tzaddik'' became synonymous with the often hereditary master heading a sect of followers.<ref name=\"Assaf1\"/><ref name=\"Ros\"/>\n\n== Hasidic philosophy ==\n{{Jewish mysticism}}\n{{main|Hasidic philosophy}}\n\n=== Distinctions ===\nThe lengthy history of Hasidism, the numerous schools of thought therein, and particularly its use of the traditional medium of homiletic literature and sermons \u2013 comprising numerous references to earlier sources in the Pentateuch, Talmud and exegesis as a means to grounding oneself in tradition \u2013 as the almost sole channel to convey its ideas, all made the isolation of a common doctrine highly challenging to researchers. As noted by [[Joseph Dan]], \"Every attempt to present such a body of ideas has failed\". Even motifs presented by scholars in the past as unique Hasidic contributions were later revealed to have been common among both their predecessors and opponents, all the more so regarding many other traits that are widely extant \u2013 these play, Dan added, \"''a prominent role in modern non-Hasidic and anti-Hasidic writings as well''\".<ref name=\"Dan2\">Joseph Dan, ''[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Hasidism/Teachings_and_Literature Hasidism: Teachings and Literature]'', [[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]</ref> The difficulty of separating the movement's philosophy from that of its main inspiration, Lurianic Kabbalah, and determining what was novel and what merely a recapitulation, also baffled historians. Some, like [[Louis Jacobs]], regarded the early masters as innovators who introduced \"much that was new if only by emphasis\";<ref>Louis Jacobs, ''Basic Ideas of Hasidism'', in: ''Hasidism'', [[Encyclopedia Judaica]], 2007. Volume 8, p. 408.</ref> others, primarily [[Mendel Piekarz]], argued to the contrary that but a little was not found in much earlier tracts, and the movement's originality lay in the manner it popularized these teachings to become the ideology of a well-organized sect.<ref>Mendel Piekarz, ''Ben ide\u02bcologyah li-metsi\u02bcut'', [[Bialik Institute]] (1994), {{OCLC|31267606}}. pp. 151-152; Dyner, ''Men of Silk'', p. 27.</ref>\n\nAmong the traits particularly associated with Hasidism in common understanding which are in fact widespread, is the importance of joy and happiness at worship and religious life \u2013 though the sect undoubtedly stressed this aspect and still possesses a clear populist bent. Another example is the value placed on the simple, ordinary Jew in supposed contradiction with the favouring of elitist scholars beforehand; such ideas are common in ethical works far preceding Hasidism. The movement did for a few decades challenge the rabbinic establishment, which relied on the authority of [[Torah]] acumen, but affirmed the centrality of study very soon. Concurrently, the image of its [[Misnagdim|Opponents]] as dreary intellectuals who lacked spiritual fervour and opposed mysticism is likewise unfounded. Neither did Hasidism, often portrayed as promoting healthy sensuality, unanimously reject the asceticism and self-mortification associated primarily with its rivals. Joseph Dan ascribed all these perceptions to so-called \"[[Neo-Hasidic]]\" writers and thinkers, like [[Martin Buber]]. In their attempt to build new models of spirituality for modern Jews, they propagated a romantic, sentimental image of the movement. The \"Neo-Hasidic\" interpretation influenced even scholarly discourse to a great degree, but had a tenuous connection with reality.<ref name=\"Dan2\"/>\n\nA further complication is the divide between what researchers term \"early Hasidism\", which ended in the early 1800s, and established Hasidism since then onwards. While the former was a highly dynamic religious revival movement, the latter phase is characterized by consolidation into sects with hereditary leadership. The mystical teachings formulated during the first era were by no means repudiated, and many Hasidic masters remained consummate spiritualists and original thinkers; as noted by [[Benjamin Brown (scholar)|Benjamin Brown]], Buber's once commonly accepted view that the routinization constituted \"decadence\" was refuted by later studies, demonstrating that the movement remained very much innovative.<ref>See, for example, Benjamin Brown, [https://www.academia.edu/9612489/ Hasidism Without Romanticism: Mendel Piekarz's Path in the study of Hasidism]. pp. 455-456.</ref> Yet many aspects of early Hasidism were indeed de-emphasized in favour of more conventional religious expressions, and its radical concepts were largely neutralized. Some ''Rebbe''s adopted a relatively rationalist bent, sidelining their explicit mystical, [[theurgical]] roles, and many others functioned almost solely as political leaders of large communities. As to their Hasidim, affiliation was less a matter of admiring a charismatic leader as in the early days, but rather birth into a family belonging to a specific \"court\".<ref>Assaf, ''Regal Way'', pp. 49-55, 63-67; Dynner, ''Men of Silk'', pp. 117-121.</ref>\n\n=== Immanence ===\nThe most fundamental theme underlying all Hasidic theory is the [[immanence]] of God in the universe, often expressed in a phrase from [[Tikunei haZohar]], ''Leit Atar panuy mi-n\u00e9ya'' ([[Aramaic]]: \"no site is devoid of Him\"). This [[panentheistic]] concept was derived from Lurianic discourse, but greatly expanded in the Hasidic one. In the beginning, in order to [[Genesis creation narrative|create the world]], God contracted (''[[Tzimtzum]]'') His Omnipresence, the ''[[Ein Sof]]'', leaving a Vacant Void (''Khalal panui''), bereft from obvious presence and therefore able to entertain free will, contradictions and other phenomena seemingly separate from God Himself. These would have been impossible within His original, perfect existence. Yet, the very reality of the world which was created in the Void is entirely dependent on its divine origin. Matter would have been null and void without the true, spiritual essence it possesses. Just the same, the infinite ''Ein Sof'' cannot manifest in the Vacant Void, and must limit itself in the guise of measurable corporeality that may be perceived.<ref name=\"Elior1\">Rachel Elior, [http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~mselio/yesod-42-sci.pdf \u05d9\u05e9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05df - \u05d3\u05e4\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d1\u05de\u05d7\u05e9\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea], in: ''Masu\u02bcot : me\u1e25\u1e33arim be-sifrut ha-\u1e33abalah ube-ma\u1e25shevet Yi\u015bra\u02bcel'', [[Bialik Institute]] (1994), {{OCLC|221873939}}. pp. 53-54.</ref>\n\nThus, there is a dualism between the true aspect of everything and the physical side, false but ineluctable, with each evolving into the other: as God must compress and disguise Himself, so must humans and matter in general ascend and reunite with the Omnipresence. [[Rachel Elior]] quoted [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], in his commentary ''[[Torah Or]]'' on Genesis 28:21, who wrote that \"''this is the purpose of Creation, from Infinity to Finitude, so it may be reversed from the state of Finite to that of Infinity''\". Kabbalah stressed the importance of this dialectic, but mainly (though not exclusively) evoked it in cosmic terms, referring for example to the manner in which God progressively diminished Himself into the world through the various dimensions, or ''[[Sephirot]]''. Hasidism applied it also to the most mundane details of human existence. All Hasidic schools devoted a prominent place in their teaching, with differing accentuation, to the interchanging nature of ''Ein'', both infinite and imperceptible, becoming ''Yesh'', \"Existent\" \u2013 and vice versa. They used the concept as a prism to gauge the world, and the needs of the spirit in particular. Elior noted: \"''Reality lost its static nature and permanent value, now measured by a new standard, seeking to expose the Godly, boundless essence, manifest in its tangible, circumscribed opposite.''\"<ref>Elior, p. 56.</ref>\n\nOne major derivative of this philosophy is the notion of ''[[devekut]]'', \"communion\". As God was everywhere, connection with Him had to be pursued ceaselessly as well, in all times, places and occasions. Such an experience was in the reach of every person, who only had to negate his inferior impulses and grasp the truth of divine immanence, enabling him to unite with it and attain the state of perfect, selfless bliss. Hasidic masters, well versed in the teachings concerning communion, are supposed not only to gain it themselves, but to guide their flock to it. ''Devekut'' was not a strictly defined experience; many varieties were described, from the utmost ecstasy of the learned leaders to the common man's more humble yet no less significant emotion during prayer.\n\nClosely linked with the former is ''Bitul ha-Yesh'', \"Negation of the Existent\", or of the \"Corporeal\". Hasidism teaches that while a superficial observance of the universe by the \"eyes of the flesh\" (''Einei ha-Basar'') purportedly reflects the reality of all things profane and worldly, a true devotee must transcend this illusory fa\u00e7ade and realize that there is nothing but God. It is not only a matter of perception, but very practical, for it entails also abandoning material concerns and cleaving only to the true, spiritual ones, oblivious to the surrounding false distractions of life. The practitioner's success in detaching from his sense of person, and conceive himself as ''Ein'' (in the double meaning of 'naught' and 'infinite'), is regarded as the highest state of elation in Hasidism. The true divine essence of man \u2013 the soul \u2013 may then ascend and return to the upper realm, where it does not possess an existence independent from God. This ideal is termed ''Hitpashtut ha-Gashmi'yut'', \"the expansion (or removal) of corporeality\". It is the dialectic opposite of God's contraction into the world.<ref>Elior, pp. 60-61.</ref>\n\nTo be enlightened and capable of ''Bitul ha-Yesh'', pursuing the pure spiritual aims and defying the primitive impulses of the body, one must overcome his inferior \"Bestial Soul\", connected with the Eyes of the Flesh. He may be able to tap into his \"Divine Soul\" (''Nefesh Elohit''), which craves communion, by employing constant contemplation, ''Hitbonenot'', on the hidden Godly dimension of all that exists. Then he could understand his surroundings with the \"Eyes of the Intellect\". The ideal adherent was intended to develop equanimity, or ''Hishtavut'' in Hasidic parlance, toward all matters worldly, not ignoring them, but understanding their superficiality.\n\nHasidic masters exhorted their followers to \"negate themselves\", paying as little heed as they could for worldly concerns, and thus, to clear the way for this transformation. The struggle and doubt of being torn between the belief in God's immanence and the very real sensual experience of the indifferent world is a key theme in the movement's literature. Many tracts have been devoted to the subject, acknowledging that the \"callous and rude\" flesh hinders one from holding fast to the ideal, and these shortcomings are extremely hard to overcome even in the purely intellectual level, a fortiori in actual life.<ref>Elior, pp. 55, 62-63.</ref>\n\nAnother implication of this dualism is the notion of \"Worship through Corporeality\", ''Avodah be-Gashmi'yut''. As the ''Ein Sof'' metamorphosed into substance, so may it in turn be raised back to its higher state; likewise, since the machinations in the higher ''Sephirot'' exert their influence on this world, even the most simple action may, if performed correctly and with understanding, achieve the reverse effect. According to Lurianic doctrine, The netherworld was suffused with divine sparks, concealed within \"husks\", ''[[Qliphoth]]''. The glints had to be recovered and elevated to their proper place in the cosmos. \"Materiality itself could be embraced and consecrated\", noted Glenn Dynner, and Hasidism taught that by common acts like dancing or eating, performed with intention, the sparks could be extricated and set free. ''Avodah be-Gashmi'yut'' had a clear, if not implicit, [[antinomian]] edge, possibly equating sacred rituals mandated by Judaism with everyday activities, granting them the same status in the believer's eyes and having him content to commit the latter at the expense of the former. While at some occasions the movement did appear to step at that direction \u2013 for example, in its early days prayer and preparation for it consumed so much time that adherents were blamed of neglecting sufficient Torah study \u2013 Hasidic masters proved highly conservative. Unlike in other, more radical sects influenced by kabbalistic ideas, like the [[Sabbateans]], Worship through Corporeality was largely limited to the elite and carefully restrained. The common adherents were taught they may engage it only mildly, through small deeds like earning money to support their leaders.\n\nThe complementary opposite of corporeal worship, or the elation of the finite into infinite, is the concept of ''Hamshacha'', \"drawing down\" or \"absorbing\", and specifically, ''Hamschat ha-Shefa'', \"absorption of effluence\". During spiritual ascension, one could siphon the power animating the higher dimensions down into the material world, where it would manifest as benevolent influence of all kinds. These included spiritual enlightenment, zest in worship and other high-minded aims, but also the more prosaic health and healing, deliverance from various troubles and simple economic prosperity. Thus, a very tangible and alluring motivation to become followers emerged. Both corporeal worship and absorption allowed the masses to access, with common actions, a religious experience once deemed esoteric.<ref>Dynner, ''Men of Silk'', pp. 32-33.</ref>\n\nYet another reflection of the ''Ein''-''Yesh'' dialectic is pronounced in the transformation of evil to goodness and the relations between these two poles and other contradicting elements \u2013 including various traits and emotions of the human psyche, like pride and humility, purity and profanity, et cetera. Hasidic thinkers argued that in order to redeem the sparks hidden, one had to associate not merely with the corporeal, but with sin and evil. One example is the elevation of impure thoughts during prayer, transforming them to noble ones rather than repressing them, advocated mainly in the early days of the sect; or \"breaking\" oneself's character by directly confronting profane inclinations. This aspect, once more, had sharp antinomian implications was and used by the Sabbateans to justify excessive sinning. It was mostly toned down in late Hasidism, and even before that leaders were careful to stress that it was not exercised in the physical sense, but in the contemplative, spiritual one. This kabbalistic notion, too, was not unique to the movement and appeared frequently among other Jewish groups.<ref>The entire section is based on: Elior, ''\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05df''; Dan, ''Teachings'', YIVO; ''Hasidism'', Judaica, pp. 410-412.</ref>\n\n=== Righteous One ===\nWhile its mystical and ethical teachings are not easily sharply distinguished from those of other Jewish currents, the defining doctrine of Hasidism is that of the saintly leader, serving both as an ideal inspiration and an institutional figure around whom followers are organized. In the movement's sacral literature, this person is referred to as the ''[[Tzadik|Tzaddiq]]'', the Righteous One \u2013 often also known by the general honorific ''Admor'' (acronym of Hebrew for \"our master, teacher and Rabbi\"), granted to rabbis in general, or colloquially as ''[[Rebbe]]''. The idea that, in every generation, there are righteous persons through whom the divine effluence is drawn to the material world is rooted in the kabbalistic thought, which also claims that one of them is supreme, the reincarnation of [[Moses]]. Hasidism elaborated the notion of the ''Tzaddiq'' into the basis of its entire system \u2013 so much that the very term gained an independent meaning within it, apart from the [[Tzadik|original which denoted God-fearing, highly observant]] people.<ref name=\"Assaf1\">David Assaf, ''The Regal Way: The Life and Times of Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin'', Stanford University Press (2002). pp. 101\u2013104.</ref>\n\nWhen the sect began to attract following and expanded from a small circle of learned disciples to a mass movement, it became evident that its complex philosophy could be imparted only partially to the new rank and file. As even intellectuals struggled with the sublime dialectics of infinity and corporeality, there was little hope to have the common folk truly internalize these, not as mere abstractions to pay lip service to.<ref>Elior, p. 65.</ref> Ideologues exhorted them to have faith, but the true answer, which marked their rise as a distinct sect, was the concept of the ''Tzaddiq''. A Hasidic master was to serve as a living embodiment of the recondite teachings. He was able to transcend matter, gain spiritual communion, Worship through Corporeality and fulfill all the theoretical ideals. As the vast majority of his flock could not do so themselves, they were to cleave to him instead, acquiring at least some semblance of those vicariously. His commanding and often \u2013 especially in the early generations \u2013 charismatic presence was to reassure the faithful and demonstrate the truth in Hasidic philosophy by countering doubts and despair. But more than spiritual welfare was concerned: Since it was believed he could ascend to the higher realms, the leader was able to harvest effluence and bring it down upon his adherents, providing them with very material benefits. \"The crystallization of that [[theurgical]] phase\", noted Glenn Dynner, \"marked Hasidism's evolution into a full-fledged social movement.\"\n\nIn Hasidic discourse, the willingness of the leader to sacrifice the ecstasy and fulfillment of unity in God was deemed a heavy sacrifice undertaken for the benefit of the congregation. His followers were to sustain and especially to obey him, as he possessed superior knowledge and insight gained through communion. The \"descent of the Righteous\" (''Yeridat ha-Tzaddiq'') into the matters of the world was depicted as identical with the need to save the sinners and redeem the sparks concealed in the most lowly places. Such a link between his functions as communal leader and spiritual guide legitimized the political power he wielded. It also prevented a retreat of Hasidic masters into hermitism and passivity, as many mystics before them did. Their worldly authority was perceived as part of their long-term mission to elevate the corporeal world back into divine infinity.<ref name=\"AA\">Elior, pp. 66\u201368; Dynner, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> To a certain extent, the Saint even fulfilled for his congregation, and for it alone, a limited [[Messiah in Judaism|Messianic]] capacity in his lifetime. After the Sabbatean debacle, this moderate approach provided a safe outlet for the eschatological urges. At least two leaders radicalized in this sphere and caused severe controversy: [[Nachman of Breslov]], who declared himself the only true ''Tzaddiq'', and [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], whom many of his followers believed to be the Messiah. The ''Rebbe''s were subject to intense hagiography, even subtly compared with Biblical figures by employing prefiguration.<ref name=\"Dan2\" /> It was argued that since followers could not \"negate themselves\" sufficiently to transcend matter, they should instead \"negate themselves\" in submission to the Saint (''hitbatlut la-Tzaddiq''), thus bonding with him and enabling themselves to access what he achieved in terms of spirituality. The Righteous served as a mystical bridge, drawing down effluence and elevating the prayers and petitions of his admirers.<ref name=\"AA\"/>\n\nThe Saintly forged a well-defined relationship with the masses: they provided the latter with inspiration, were consulted in all matters, and were expected to intercede on behalf of their adherents with God and ensure they gained financial prosperity, health and male offspring. The pattern still characterizes Hasidic sects, though prolonged routinization in many turned the ''Rebbes'' into de facto political leaders of strong, institutionalized communities. The role of a Saint was obtained by charisma, erudition and appeal in the early days of Hasidism. But by the dawn of the 19th century, the Righteous began to claim legitimacy by descent to the masters of the past, arguing that since they linked matter with infinity, their abilities had to be associated with their own corporeal body. Therefore, it was accepted \"there can be no ''Tzaddiq'' but the son of a ''Tzaddiq''\". Virtually all modern sects maintain this hereditary principle. For example, the ''Rebbe''s' families maintain endogamy and marry almost solely with scions of other dynasties.<ref>Assaf, ''Regal Way'', pp. 108\u2013110.</ref>\n\n=== Schools of thought ===\nSome Hasidic \"courts\", and not a few individual prominent masters, developed distinct philosophies with particular accentuation of various themes in the movement's general teachings. Several of these Hasidic schools had lasting influence over many dynasties, while others died with their proponents. In the doctrinal sphere, the dynasties may be divided along many lines. Some are characterized by ''Rebbe''s who are predominantly Torah scholars and [[Posek|decisors]], deriving their authority much like ordinary non-Hasidic rabbis do. Such \"courts\" place great emphasis on strict observance and study, and are among the most meticulous in the Orthodox world in practice. Prominent examples are the House of [[Sanz]] and its scions, such as [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], or [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]]. Other sects, like [[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz]], espouse a charismatic-populist line, centered on the admiration of the masses for the Righteous, his effervescent style of prayer and conduct and his purported miracle-working capabilities. Fewer still retain a high proportion of the mystical-spiritualist themes of early Hasidism, and encourage members to study much kabbalistic literature and (carefully) engage in the field. The various [[Ziditchover]] dynasties mostly adhere to this philosophy.<ref name=\"RAD\"/>\nOthers still focus on contemplation and achieving inner perfection. No dynasty is wholly devoted to a single approach of the above, and all offer some combination with differing emphasis on each of those.\n\nIn 1812, a schism occurred between the [[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin|Seer of Lublin]] and his prime disciple, the [[Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz|Holy Jew]] of [[Przysucha]], due to both personal and doctrinal disagreements. The Seer adopted a populist approach, centered on the Righteous' theurgical functions to draw the masses. He was famous for his lavish, enthusiastic conduct during prayer and worship, and extremely charismatic demeanour. He stressed that as ''Tzaddiq'', his mission was to influence the common folk by absorbing Divine Light and satisfying their material needs, thus converting them to his cause and elating them. The Holy Jew pursued a more introspective course, maintaining that the ''Rebbe'''s duty was to serve as a spiritual mentor for a more elitist group, helping them to achieve a senseless state of contemplation, aiming to restore man to his oneness with God which [[Adam]] supposedly lost when he ate the fruit of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Lignum Scientiae]]. The Holy Jew and his successors did neither repudiate miracle working, nor did they eschew dramatic conduct; but they were much more restrained in general. The Przysucha School became dominant in [[Congress Poland|Central Poland]], while populist Hasidism resembling the Lublin ethos often prevailed in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]].<ref>Dynner, pp. 29-31.</ref> One extreme and renowned philosopher who emerged from the Przysucha School was [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk]]. Adopting an elitist, hard-line attitude, he openly denounced the folkly nature of other ''Tzaddiqim'', and rejected financial support. Gathering a small group of devout scholars who sought to attain spiritual perfection, whom he often berated and mocked, he always stressed the importance of both somberness and totality, stating it was better to be fully wicked than only somewhat good.\n\nThe [[Chabad]] school, limited to its namesake dynasty, but prominent, was founded by [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] and was elaborated by his successors, until the late 20th century. The movement retained many of the attributes of early Hasidism, before a clear divide between Righteous and ordinary followers was cemented. Chabad ''Rebbe''s insisted their adherents acquire proficiency in the sect's lore, and not relegate most responsibility to the leaders. The sect emphasizes the importance of intellectually grasping the dynamics of the hidden divine aspect and how they affect the human psyche; the very acronym Chabad is for the three penultimate ''[[Sephirot]]'', associated with the cerebral side of consciousness.\n\nAnother famous philosophy is that formulated by [[Nachman of Breslov]] and adhered to by Breslov Hasidim. In contrast to most of his peers who believed God must be worshiped through joy, Nachman portrayed the corporeal world in grim colors, as a place devoid of God's immediate presence from which the soul yearns to liberate itself. He mocked the attempts to perceive the nature of infinite-finite dialectics and the manner in which God still occupies the Vacant Void albeit not, stating these were paradoxical, beyond human understanding. Only naive faith in their reality would do. Mortals were in constant struggle to overcome their profane instincts, and had to free themselves from their limited intellects to see the world as it truly is.\n\n[[Tzvi Hirsh of Zidichov]], a major Galician ''Tzaddiq'', was a disciple of the Seer of Lublin, but combined his populist inclination with a strict observance even among his most common followers, and great pluralism in matters pertaining to mysticism, as those were eventually emanating from each person's unique soul.\n\n[[Mordechai Yosef Leiner]] of [[Izbica]] promulgated a radical understanding of free will, which he considered illusory and also derived directly from God. He argued that when one attained a sufficient spiritual level and could be certain evil thoughts did not derive from his animalistic soul, then sudden urges to transgress revealed Law were God-inspired and may be pursued. This volatile, potentially antinomian doctrine of \"Transgression for the Sake of Heaven\" is found also in other Hasidic writings, especially from the early period. His successors de-emphasized it in their commentaries. Leiner's disciple [[Zadok HaKohen]] of Lublin also developed a complex philosophic system which presented a dialectic nature in history, arguing that great progress had to be preceded by crisis and calamity.\n\n== Practice and culture ==\n\n=== ''Rebbe'' and \"court\" ===\nThe Hasidic community is organized in a sect known as \"court\" (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05e6\u05e8, ''hatzer''; Yiddish: \u05d4\u05d0\u05e3, ''Hoif''). In the early days of the movement, a particular ''Rebbe'''s following usually resided in the same town, and Hasidim were categorized by their leaders' settlement: a Hasid of Belz, Vizhnitz and so forth. Later, especially after World War II, the dynasties retained the names of their original Eastern European settlements when moving to the West or Israel. Thus, for example, the \"court\" established by [[Joel Teitelbaum]] in 1905 at Transylvania remained known after its namesake town, [[Sathmar]], even though its headquarters lay in New York, and almost all other Hasidic sects likewise \u2013 albeit some groups founded overseas were named accordingly, like the [[Boston (Hasidic dynasty)]].\n\nAkin to his spiritual status, the ''Rebbe'' is also the administrative head of the community. Sects often possess their own synagogues, study halls and internal charity mechanisms, and ones sufficiently large also maintain entire educational systems. The ''Rebbe'' is the supreme figure of authority, and not just for the institutions. The rank-and-file Hasidim are also expected to consult with him on important matters, and often seek his blessing and advice. He is personally attended by aides known as ''[[Gabbai]]'' or ''Mashbak''.\n\nMany particular Hasidic rites surround the leader. On the Sabbath, holidays, and celebratory occasions, ''Rebbe''s hold a ''[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|Tisch]]'' (table), a large feast for their male adherents. Together, they sing, dance, and eat, and the head of the sect shakes the hands of his followers to bless them, and often delivers a sermon. A ''Chozer'', \"repeater\", selected for his good memory, commits the text to writing after the Sabbath (any form of writing during the Sabbath itself [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|being forbidden]]). In many \"courts\", the remnants of his meal, supposedly suffused with holiness, are handed out and even fought over. Often, a very large dish is prepared beforehand and the ''Rebbe'' only tastes it before passing it to the crowd. Apart from the gathering at noon, the [[Seudah Shlishit|third repast]] on Sabbath and the \"[[Melaveh Malkah]]\" meal when it ends are also particularly important and an occasion for song, feasting, tales and sermons. A central custom, which serves as a major factor in the economics of most \"courts\", is the ''Pidyon'', \"Ransom\", better known by its Yiddish name ''[[Kvitel]]'', \"little note\": adherents submit a written petition, which the master may assist with on behalf of his sanctity, adding a sum of money for either charity or the leader's needs.<ref>[[Louis Jacobs]], ''[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Hasidism/Everyday_Life Hasidism: Everyday Life]'', [[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]].</ref><ref>''Hasidism: Hasidic Way of Life'', Encyclopedia Judaica, Volume 8, pp. 398-399.</ref> Occasions in the \"court\" serve as pretext for mass gatherings, flaunting the power, wealth and size of each. Weddings of the leader's family, for example, are often held with large multistoried stands (\u05e4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05e0\u05d8\u05e9\u05e2\u05e1, ''Parentches'') filled with Hasidim surround the main floor, where the ''Rebbe'' and his relatives dine, celebrate and perform the [[Mitzvah tantz]]. This is a festive dance with the bride: both parties hold one end of a long sash, a Hasidic [[gartel]], for reasons of modesty.\n\nAllegiance to the dynasty and ''Rebbe'' is also often a cause for tension and violence.<ref>Mintz, Jerome R. (1992). ''Hasidic People: A Place in the New World''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|9780674381162}}. pp. 58, 135-136, etc.</ref> Notable feuds between \"courts\" include the 1926\u201334 strife after [[Chaim Elazar Spira]] of [[Munkacs (Hasidic dynasty)|Munkatch]] cursed the deceased [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach I]] of Belz;<ref>[http://www.jta.org/1927/02/10/archive/chassidic-feud-leads-to-split-in-community Chassidic Feud Leads to Split in Community.] JTA, February 10, 1927.</ref> the 1980\u20132012 Satmar-Belz collision after [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach II]] broke with the [[Orthodox Council of Jerusalem]], which culminated when he had to travel in a bulletproof car;<ref>[http://www.jta.org/1981/03/05/archive/belzer-rebbe-under-heavy-security-guard-due-to-threats-on-his-life Belzer Rebbe Under Heavy Security Guard Due to Threats on His Life]. JTA, March 5, 1981.</ref> and the 2006\u2013present Satmar succession dispute between brothers [[Aaron Teitelbaum]] and [[Zalman Teitelbaum]], which saw mass riots.\n\nLike in other [[Ultra-Orthodox]] groups, Hasidim who wish to disaffiliate from the community face threats, hostility, violence and various punitive measures, among them separation of children from their disaffiliated parents, especially in divorce cases. Due to their strictly religious education and traditionalist upbringing, those who leave their sects are devoid of working skills and even command of the English language, and their integration into outer society is extremely problematic.<ref>Cf., for example: Judy Bolton-Fasman, [http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/1.670557 Off the Path' Memoirs of ex-Hasidic Jews Shine Light on Faigy Mayer\u2019s World]. [[Haaretz]], 11 August 2015.</ref> The conservative and segregated communities are also a comfortable setting for [[sexual abuse of children]], and numerous incidents have been reported. While Hasidic leadership has often been accused of silencing the matter, awareness of it is rising within the sects.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joseph |last=Berger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/nyregion/sexual-abuse-questions-swirl-around-yeshiva-leader-in-kiryas-joel.html |title=Sexual Abuse Questions Swirl Around Yeshiva Leader in Kiryas Joel |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother related phenomenon is the recent rise of ''Mashpi'im'' (\"influencers\"). Once a title for an instructor in Chabad and Breslov only, the institutionalized nature of the established \"courts\" led many adherents to seek guidance and inspiration from persons who did not declare themselves new leaders, but only ''Mashpi'im''. Technically, they fill the original role of ''Rebbe''s in providing for spiritual welfare; yet, they do not usurp the title, and are therefore countenanced.<ref>Tomer Persico, ''[https://tomerpersico.com/2014/03/27/brown_interview/ \u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05d6\u05e6\u05d9\u05d4 \u05de\u05d5\u05dc \u05d4\u05e7\u05e6\u05e0\u05d4, \u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05d5\u05dc \u05d4\u05e1\u05ea\u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u2013 \u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05e2\u05dd \u05d3\"\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05df \u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05df \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea]''.</ref>\n\n=== Liturgy ===\nMost Hasidim use some variation of ''[[Nusach Sefard]]'', a blend of [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi]] liturgies, based on the innovations of Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]]. Many dynasties have their own specific adaptation of Nusach Sefard; some, such as the versions of the Belzer, Bobover, and [[Dushinsky (Hasidic dynasty)|Dushinsky]] Hasidim, are closer to Nusach Ashkenaz, while others, such as the Munkacz version, are closer to the old Lurianic. Many sects believe that their version reflects Luria's mystical devotions best. The Baal Shem Tov added two segments to Friday services on the eve of Sabbath: Psalm 107 before [[Mincha|afternoon prayer]], and Psalm 23 at the end of [[Maariv (prayer)|evening service]].\n\nHasidim use the [[Ashkenazi pronunciation]] of [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]] for liturgical purposes, reflecting their Eastern European background. Wordless, emotional melodies, ''[[nigun]]im'', are particularly common in their services.\n\nHasidim lend great importance to ''[[Kavanah|kavana]]'', devotion or intention, and their services tend to be extremely long and repetitive. Some courts nearly abolished traditional specified times by which prayers must be conducted (''zemanim''), to prepare and concentrate. This practice, still enacted in [[Chabad]] for one, is controversial in many dynasties, which do follow the specifics of [[Jewish Law]] on praying earlier, and not eating beforehand. Another reglement is daily immersion in a [[Mikveh|ritual bath]] by males for spiritual cleansing, at a rate much higher than is customary among other Orthodox Jews.\n\n=== Appearance ===\n[[File:Hasidic Family in Street - Borough Park - Hasidic District - Brooklyn.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Hasidic family in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]]. The man is wearing a [[shtreimel]], and either a [[bekishe]] or a [[rekel]]. The woman is wearing a wig, called a [[sheitel]], as she is forbidden to show her hair in public.]]\n\nWithin the Hasidic world, it is possible to distinguish different Hasidic groups by subtle differences in dress. Some details of their dress are shared by non-Hasidic Haredim. Much of Hasidic dress was historically the clothing of all Eastern European Jews, influenced by the style of [[Szlachta|Polish\u2013Lithuanian nobility]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Goldberg-Mulkiewicz|first=Olga|encyclopedia=[[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]|title=Dress|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Dress|accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref> Furthermore, Hasidim have attributed religious origins to specific Hasidic items of clothing.\n\nHasidic men most commonly wear dark overclothes. On weekdays, they wear a long, black, cloth jacket called a [[rekel]], and on [[Jewish holidays|Jewish Holy Days]], the [[bekishe]] ''zaydene kapote'' (Yiddish, lit., satin caftan), a similarly long, black jacket, but of [[satin]] fabric traditionally silk. Indoors, the colorful tish [[bekishe]] is still worn. Some Hasidim wear a satin overcoat, known as ''rezhvolke''. A rebbe's ''rezhvolke'' might be trimmed with velvet. Most do not wear [[necktie]]s.\n\nOn [[Shabbat|the Sabbath]], the Hasidic ''Rebbes'' traditionally wore a white [[bekishe]]. This practice has fallen into disuse among most. Many of them wear a black silk ''[[bekishe]]'' that is trimmed with velvet (known as ''stro-kes'' or ''samet'') and in Hungarian ones, gold-embroidered.\n\nVarious symbolic and religious qualities are attributed to Hasidic dress, though they are mainly apocryphal and the clothes' origin is cultural and historical. For example, the long overcoats are considered modest, the Shtreimel is supposedly related to [[shaatnez]] and keeps one warm without using [[wool]], and Sabbath shoes are laceless in order not to have to tie a knot, a prohibited action. A ''[[gartel]]'' divides the Hasid's lower parts from his upper parts, implying modesty and chastity, and for kabbalistic reasons, Hasidim button their clothes right over left. Hasidim customarily wear black hats during the weekdays, as do nearly all Haredim today. A variety of hats are worn depending on the group: Chabad often pinch their hats to form a triangle on the top, Satmar wear an open-crown hat with rounded edges, and ''Samet'' (velvet) or ''biber'' ([[beaver]]) hats are worn by many Galician and Hungarian Hasidim.\n\n[[File:Rabbi Moshe Leib Rabinovich.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Rabbi [[Moshe Leib Rabinovich]], [[Munkacs (Hasidic dynasty)|Munkacser]] [[Rebbe]], wearing a ''[[kolpik]]'']]\n\nMarried Hasidim don a variety of fur [[headdress]]es on the Sabbath, once common among all wedded Eastern European Jewish males and still worn by non-Hasidic [[Perushim]] in Jerusalem. The most ubiquitous is the ''[[Shtreimel]]'', which is seen especially among Galician and Hungarian sects like Satmar or Belz. A taller ''[[Spodik]]'' is donned by Polish dynasties such as [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]]. A ''[[Kolpik]]'' is worn by unmarried sons and grandsons of many Rebbes on the Sabbath. Some Rebbes don it on special occasions.\n\n[[File:HasidicRebbe.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The [[Dorohoi]] Rebbe in his traditional rabbinical [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] garb]]\nThere are many other distinct items of clothing. Such are the [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Gerrer]] ''hoyznzokn''\u2014long black socks into which the trousers are tucked. Some Hasidim from Eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] wear black socks with their breeches on the Sabbath, as opposed to white ones on weekdays, particularly [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belzer]] Hasidim.\n\nFollowing a Biblical commandment not to shave the sides of one's face (Leviticus 19:27), male members of most Hasidic groups wear long, uncut sidelocks called [[payot]] (or ''peyes''). Some Hasidic men shave off the rest of their hair. Not every Hasidic group requires long peyos, and not all Jewish men with peyos are Hasidic, but all Hasidic groups discourage the shaving of one's beard. Most Hasidic boys receive their [[first haircut]]s ceremonially at the age of three years (only the Skverrer Hasidim do this at their boys' second birthday). Until then, Hasidic boys have long hair.\n\nHasidic women wear clothing adhering to the principles of [[tzeniut|modest dress in Jewish law]]. This includes long, conservative skirts and sleeves past the elbow, as well as covered necklines. Also, the women wear stockings to cover their legs; in some Hasidic groups, such as [[Satmar]] or [[Toldot Aharon]], the stockings must be opaque. In keeping with [[Halacha|Jewish law]], married women cover their hair, using either a ''[[sheitel]]'' (wig), a ''[[tichel]]'' (headscarf), a ''[[shpitzel]]'', a [[Snood (headgear)|snood]], a hat, or a beret. In some Hasidic groups, such as [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], women may wear two headcoverings \u2013 a wig and a scarf, or a wig and a hat.\n\n=== Families ===\n\nHasidic Jews, like many other Orthodox Jews, typically produce large families; the average Hasidic family in the United States has 8 children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/jewishsociety/Jews_and_the_Jewish_Birthrate.asp |title=Jews and the Jewish Birthrate |publisher=Aish.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> This is followed out of a desire to fulfill the Biblical mandate to \"[[Cultural mandate|be fruitful and multiply]]\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Citron |first=Aryeh |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1005203/jewish/Be-Fruitful-and-Multiply.htm |title=Be Fruitful and Multiply \u2013 Parshat Bereishit \u2013 Parshah Halachah |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Languages ===\n{{Main|Yiddish language}}\nMost Hasidim speak the language of their countries of residence, but use [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] among themselves as a way of remaining distinct and preserving tradition. Thus, children are still learning Yiddish today, and the language, despite predictions to the contrary, is not dead. Yiddish newspapers are still published, and Yiddish fiction is being written, primarily aimed at women. Even films in Yiddish are being produced within the Hasidic community. Some Hasidic groups, such as [[Satmar]] or [[Toldot Aharon]], actively oppose the everyday use of Hebrew, which they consider a holy tongue. The use of Hebrew for anything other than prayer and study is, according to them, profane. Hence, Yiddish is the vernacular and common tongue for many Hasidim around the world.\n\n=== Literature ===\n[[File:Chassid22.jpg|thumb|right|Sculpture of the Hasidic movement on the [[Knesset Menorah]].]]\nHasidic Tales are a literary genre, concerning both hagiography of various ''Rebbes'' and moralistic themes. Some are anecdotes or recorded conversations dealing with matters of faith, practice, and the like. The most famous tend to be terse and carry a strong and obvious point. They were often transmitted orally, though the earliest compendium is from 1815.<ref name=\"Schacter-Shalomi, Zalman 2003\">Schacter-Shalomi, Zalman, Wrapped in a Holy Flame (2003) San Francisco CA, Jossey-Bass, {{ISBN|0-7879-6573-1}}</ref>\n\nMany revolve around the Righteous.

They are mainly affiliated with the [[Orthodox Council of Jerusalem]] and the [[Central Rabbinical Congress]]. The great majority belong to ''Agudas Israel'', represented in Israel by the [[United Torah Judaism]] party. Its [[Council of Torah Sages]] now includes a dozen ''Rebbe''s.

Of those, 62,000 resided in [[Israel]] and 53,500 in the [[United States]], 5,500 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and 3,400 in [[Canada]]. In Israel, the largest Hasidic concentrations are in the Ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods of [[Jerusalem]] \u2013 including [[Ramot Alon]], [[Batei Ungarin]] et cetera \u2013 in the cities of [[Bnei Brak]] and [[El'ad]], and in the [[West Bank settlement]]s of [[Modi'in Illit]] and [[Beitar Illit]]. There is considerable presence in other specifically Orthodox municipalities or enclaves, like [[Kiryat Sanz, Netanya]]. In the United States, most Hasidim reside in [[New York (state)|New York]], though there are small communities across the entire country. In [[Brooklyn]], [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], and [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] all house a particularly large population. So does the hamlet of [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]] in upstate New York. In the same region, [[New Square]] and [[Kiryas Joel]] are rapidly growing all-Hasidic enclaves, one founded by the [[Skver]] dynasty and the other by Satmar. In Britain, [[Stamford Hill]] is home to the largest Hasidic community in the country, and there are others in London and [[Prestwich]] in Manchester. In Canada, [[Kiryas Tosh]] is a settlement populated entirely by [[Tosh (Hasidic dynasty)|Tosh]] Hasidim, and there are more adherents of other sects in and around Montreal.<ref name=\"Wodz\">All numbers are from: Marcin Wodzi\u0144ski, ''Historical Atlas of Hasidism'', Princeton University Press, 2018. pp. 192-205.</ref>\n\nThere are more than a dozen Hasidic dynasties with a large following, and over a hundred which have small or minuscule adherence, sometimes below twenty people, with the presumptive ''Rebbe'' holding the title more as a matter of prestige. Many \"courts\" became completely extinct during the [[Holocaust]], like the [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)]] from [[Aleksandr\u00f3w \u0141\u00f3dzki]], which numbered tens of thousands in 1939, and barely exists today.<ref>Jacques Gutwirth, The Rebirth of Hasidism: From 1945 to the Present Day, Odile Jacob, 2004. pp. 106-108.</ref>\n\nThe largest sect in the world, with some 26,000 member households which constitute 20% of all Hasidim,is [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], founded in 1905 in the namesake city in Hungary and based in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] and [[Kiryas Joel]]. Satmar is known for its conservatism and opposition to both ''[[World Agudath Israel|Agudas Israel]]'' and [[Zionism]], inspired by the legacy of Hungarian Ultra-Orthodoxy. The sect underwent a schism in 2006 and two competing factions emerged, led by rival brothers [[Aaron Teitelbaum]] and [[Zalman Teitelbaum]]. The second-largest \"court\" worldwide, with some 11,600 households (or 9% of all Hasidism) is [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], established in 1859 at [[G\u00f3ra Kalwaria]], near [[Warsaw]]. For decades, it was the dominant power in ''Agudas'' and espoused a moderate line toward Zionism and modern culture. Its origins lay in the rationalist [[Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz|Przysucha School]] of [[Congress Poland|Central Poland]]. The current Rebbe is [[Yaakov Aryeh Alter]]. The third largest dynasty is [[Vizhnitz]], a charismatic sect founded in 1854 at [[Vyzhnytsia]], [[Bukovina]]. A moderate group involved in Israeli politics, it is split into several branches, which maintain cordial relations. The main partition is between Vizhnitz-Israel and Vizhnitz-Monsey, headed respectively by Rebbes Israel Hager and the eight sons of the late Rebbe Mordecai Hager. In total, all Vizhnitz sub-\"courts\" constitute over 10,500 households. The fourth major dynasty, with some 7,000 households, is [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]], established 1817 in namesake [[Belz]], south of [[Lviv]]. An [[Eastern Galicia]]n dynasty drawing both from the [[Seer of Lublin]]'s charismatic-populist style and \"rabbinic\" Hasidism, it espoused hard-line positions, but broke off from the [[Orthodox Council of Jerusalem]] and joined ''Agudas'' in 1979. Belz is led by Rebbe [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach (fifth Belzer rebbe)|Yissachar Dov Rokeach]].<ref name=\"Wodz\"/> \n\nThe [[Bobover]] dynasty, founded 1881 in [[Bobowa]], [[West Galicia]], constitutes some 4,500 households in total and has undergone a bitter succession strife since 2005, eventually forming the \"Bobov\" (3,000 households) and \"[[Bobov-45]]\" (1,500 households) sects. [[Sanz-Klausenburg]], divided into a New York and Israeli branches, presides over 3,800 households. The [[Skver]] sect, established in 1848 in [[Skvyra]] near [[Kiev]], constitutes 3,300. The [[Shomer Emunim]] dynasties, originating in Jerusalem during the 1920s and known for their unique style of dressing imitating that of the [[Old Yishuv]], have over 3,000 families, almost all in the larger \"courts\" of [[Toldos Aharon]] and [[Toldos Avraham Yitzchak]]. [[Karlin Stolin]], which rose already in the 1760s in a quarter of [[Pinsk]], encompasses 2,200 families.<ref name=\"Wodz\"/> \n\nThere are two other populous Hasidic sub-groups, which do not function as classical ''Rebbe''-headed \"courts\", but as decentralized movements, retaining some of the characteristics of early Hasidism.<ref>Brown, \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4. p. 86.</ref> [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]] rose under its charismatic leader [[Nachman of Breslov]] in the early 19th century. Critical of all other ''Rebbes'', he forbade his followers to appoint a successor upon his death in 1810. His acolytes led small groups of adherents, persecuted by other Hasidim, and disseminated his teachings. The original philosophy of the sect elicited great interest among modern scholars, and that led many [[Baal teshuva movement|newcomers to Orthodox Judaism (\"repentants\")]] to join it. Numerous Breslov communities, each led by its own rabbis, now have thousands of full-fledged followers and far more admirers and semi-committed supporters; Marcin Wodzi\u0144ski estimated that the fully committed population of Breslovers may be estimated at 7,000 households. [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], originating in the 1770s, did have hereditary leadership, but always stressed the importance of self-study rather than reliance on the Righteous. Its seventh and last leader, [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], converted it into a vehicle for Jewish outreach. By his death in 1994, it had many more semi-engaged supporters than Hasidim in the strict sense, and they are still hard to distinguish. Chabad's own internal phone-books list some 16,800 member households.<ref name=\"Wodz\"/> None succeeded Schneerson, and the sect operates as a large network of communities with independent leaders.\n\n== History ==\n{{Judaism}}\n\n=== Background ===\nIn the late 17th century, several social trends converged among the Jews who inhabited the southern periphery of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], especially in contemporary [[Western Ukraine]]. These enabled the emergence and flourishing of Hasidism.\n\nThe first and most prominent was the popularization of the mystical lore of Kabbalah. For several centuries, an esoteric teaching practiced surreptitiously by few, it was transformed into almost household knowledge by a mass of cheap printed pamphlets. The kabbalistic inundation was a major influence behind the rise of the heretical [[Sabbatean]] movement, led by [[Sabbatai Zevi]], who declared himself [[Messiah]] in 1665. The propagation of Kabbalah made the Jewish masses susceptible to Hasidic ideas, themselves in essence a popularized version of the teaching \u2013 indeed, Hasidism actually emerged when its founders determined to openly practice it instead of remaining a secret circle of ascetics as was the manner of almost all past kabbalists. The correlation between publicizing the lore and Sabbateanism did not escape the rabbinic elite, and caused vehement opposition to the new movement.\n\nAnother factor was the decline of the traditional authority structures. Jewish autonomy remained quite secured; later research debunked [[Simon Dubnow]]'s claim that the [[Council of Four Lands]]' demise in 1746 was a culmination of a long process which destroyed judicial independence and paved the way for the Hasidic ''rebbes'' to serve as leaders (another long-held explanation for the sect's rise advocated by [[Raphael Mahler]], that the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] effected economic impoverishment and despair, was also refuted). However, the [[Szlachta|magnates and nobles]] held much sway over the nomination of both rabbis and communal elders, to such a degree that the masses often perceived them as mere lackeys of the land owners. Their ability to serve as legitimate arbiters in disputes \u2013 especially those concerning the regulation of leasehold rights over alcohol distillation and other monopolies in the estates \u2013 was severely diminished. The reduced prestige of the establishment, and the need for an alternative source of authority to pass judgement, left a vacuum which Hasidic charismatics eventually filled. They transcended old communal institutions, to which all the Jews of a locality were subordinate, and had groups of followers in each town across vast territories. Often supported by rising strata outside the traditional elite, whether nouveau riche or various low-level religious functionaries, they created a modern form of leadership.\n\nHistorians discerned other influences. The formative age of Hasidism coincided with the rise of numerous religious revival movements across the world, including the [[First Great Awakening]] in [[New England]], German [[Pietism]], [[Wahhabism]] in Arabia and the Russian [[Old Believers]] who opposed the established church. They all rejected the existing order, decrying it as stale and overly hierarchic. They offered what they described as more spiritual, candid and simple substitutes. [[Gershon David Hundert]] noted the considerable similarity between the Hasidic conceptions and this general background, rooting both in the growing importance attributed to the individual's consciousness and choices.<ref>Glenn Dynner, ''Men of Silk: The Hasidic Conquest of Polish Jewish Society'', Oxford University Press (2006). pp. 3\u201323.</ref>\n\n=== Israel ben Eliezer ===\n{{Main|Baal Shem Tov}}\n[[File:Besht Signature.jpg|thumb|right|Israel ben Eliezer's autograph.]]\n[[Israel ben Eliezer]] (ca. 1690\u20131760), known as the ''Baal Shem Tov'' (\"Master of the ''Good'' Name\", [[Acronym]]: \"Besht\"), is considered the founder of Hasidism. Born apparently south of the [[Prut]], in the northern frontier of [[Moldavia]], he earned a reputation as a [[Baal Shem]], \"Master of the Name\". These were common folk healers who employed mysticism, amulets and incantations at their trade. Little is known for certain on ben Eliezer. Though no scholar, he was sufficiently learned to become notable in the communal hall of study and marry into the rabbinic elite, his wife being the divorced sister of a rabbi; in his later years he was wealthy and famous, as attested by contemporary chronicles. Apart from that, most is derived from Hasidic hagiographic accounts. These claim that as a boy he was recognized by one \"Rabbi Adam Baal Shem Tov\" who entrusted him with great secrets of the [[Torah]] passed in his illustrious family for centuries. the Besht later spent a decade in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] as a hermit, where he was visited by the Biblical prophet [[Ahijah the Shilonite]] who taught him more. At the age of thirty-six, he was granted heavenly permission to reveal himself as a great kabbalist and miracle worker.\n\nBy the 1740s, it is verified that he relocated to the town of [[Medzhybizh]] and became recognized and popular in all [[Podolia]] and beyond. It is well attested that he did emphasize several known kabbalistic concepts, formulating a teaching of his own to some degree. The Besht stressed the immanence of God and His presence in the material world, and that therefore, physical acts, such as eating, have actual influence on the spiritual sphere and may serve to hasten the achievement of communion with the divine (''devekut''). He was known to pray ecstatically and with great [[Kavanah|intention]], again in order to provide channels for the [[Ohr|divine light]] to flow into the earthly realm. The Besht stressed the importance of joy and contentment in the worship of God, rather than the abstinence and self-mortification deemed essential to become a pious mystic, and of fervent and vigorous prayer as a means of spiritual elation instead of severe aestheticism<ref name=\"Ros1\"/> \u2013 though many of his immediate disciples reverted in part to the older doctrines, especially in disavowing sexual pleasure even in marital relations.<ref>David Biale, ''The Lust for Asceticism in the Ha-sidic Movement'', in: Jonathan Magonet, ''Jewish Explorations of Sexuality'' . Oxford University Press (1995). pp. 53-55.</ref> In that, the \"Besht\" laid the foundation for a popular movement, offering a far less rigorous course for the masses to gain a significant religious experience. And yet, he remained the guide of a small society of elitists, in the tradition of former kabbalists, and never led a large public as his successors did. While many later figures cited him as the inspiration behind the full-fledged Hasidic doctrine, the Besht himself did not practice it in his lifetime.<ref name=\"Ros1\">Moshe Rosman, ''[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Baal_Shem_Tov Ba\u2018al Shem Tov]'', [[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]].</ref>\n\n=== Consolidation ===\n[[File:Isroel Hopsztajn.jpg|thumb|Rabbi [[Yisroel Hopsztajn]], one of the greatest promulgators of Hasidism in Poland, blessing acolytes. Circa 1800.|300px]]\nIsrael ben Eliezer gathered a considerable following, drawing to himself disciples from far away. They were largely of elitist background, yet adopted the populist approach of their master. The most prominent was Rabbi [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch|Dov Ber]] the ''[[Maggid]]'' (preacher). He succeeded the former upon his death, though other important acolytes, mainly [[Jacob Joseph of Polonne]], did not accept his leadership. Establishing himself in [[Mezhirichi]], the Maggid turned to greatly elaborate the Besht's rudimentary ideas and institutionalize the nascent circle into an actual movement. Ben Eliezer and his acolytes used the very old and common epithet ''[[hasidim]]'', \"pious\"; in the latter third of the 18th century, a clear differentiation arose between that sense of the word and what was at first described as \"New Hasidism\", propagated to a degree by the Maggid and especially his successors.<ref name=\"Ros\">Moshe Rosman, ''Founder of Hasidism: A Quest for the Historical Ba'al Shem Tov''. University of California Press (1996). pp. 37-38.</ref>\n\nDoctrine coalesced as Jacob Joseph, Dov Ber and the latter's disciple Rabbi [[Elimelech of Lizhensk]] composed the three magna opera of early Hasidism, respectively: the 1780 ''Toldot Ya'akov Yosef'', the 1781 ''Maggid d'varav le-Ya'akov'' and the 1788 ''No'am Elimelekh''. Other books were also published. Their new teaching had many aspects. The importance of devotion in prayer was stressed to such degree that many waited beyond the prescribed time to properly prepare; the Besht's recommendation to \"elevate and sanctify\" impure thoughts rather than simply repress them during the service was expanded by Dov Ber into an entire precept, depicting prayer as a mechanism to transform thoughts and feelings from a primal to a higher state in a manner parallel to the unfolding of the ''[[Sephirot]]''. But the most important was the notion of the ''Tzaddiq'' \u2013 later designated by the general rabbinic honorific [[Rebbe#The hasidic rebbe|''Admor'' (our master, teacher and rabbi) or by the colloquial ''Rebbe'']] \u2013 the Righteous One, the mystic who was able to elate and achieve communion with the divine, but unlike kabbalists past, did not practice it in secret, but as leader of the masses. He was able to bring down prosperity and guidance from the higher ''Sephirot'', and the common people who could not attain such a state themselves would achieve it by \"clinging\" to and obeying him. The ''Tzaddiq'' served as a bridge between the spiritual realm and the ordinary folk, as well as a simple, understandable embodiment of the esoteric teachings of the sect, which were still beyond the reach of most just as old-style Kabbalah before.\n\nThe various Hasidic ''Tzaddiqim'', mainly the Maggid's disciples, spread across Eastern Europe with each gathering adherents among the people and learned acolytes who could be initiated as leaders. The Righteous' \"courts\" in which they resided, attended by their followers to receive blessing and council, became the institutional centers of Hasidism, serving as its branches and organizational core. Slowly, various rites emerged in them, like the Sabbath ''[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|Tisch]]'' or \"table\", in which the Righteous would hand out food scraps from their meals, considered blessed by the touch of ones imbued with godly Light during their mystical ascensions.<ref>Dyner, pp. 34-39, 42.</ref> Another potent institution was the ''[[Shtibel]]'', the private prayer gatherings opened by adherents in every town which served as a recruiting mechanism. The ''Shtibel'' differed from the established synagogues and study halls, allowing their members greater freedom to worship when they pleased and also serving recreational and welfare purposes. Combined with its simplified message, more appealing to the common man, its honed organizational framework accounted for the exponential growth of Hasidic ranks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Stampfer, Why Hasidism Spreaf|last=Stampfer|first=Shaul|publisher=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem|year=|isbn=|location=Jerusalem|pages=203\u2013207}}</ref> Having ousted the old communal model and replaced it with a less-hierarchical structure and more individually-oriented religiosity, Hasidism was in fact the first great modern \u2013 albeit not modernist; its self-understanding was grounded in a traditional mindset \u2013 Jewish movement.<ref>For exampe: Murray Rosman, ''[https://www.academia.edu/19681639 Hasidism \u2013 Traditional Modernization]'', Simon Dubnow Institute Yearbook 6 (2007).</ref>\n\nFrom its original base in [[Podolia]] and [[Volhynia]], the movement was rapidly disseminated during the Maggid's lifetime and after his 1772 death. Twenty or so of Dov Ber's prime disciples each brought it to a different region, and their own successors followed: [[Aharon of Karlin (I)]], [[Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk]] and [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] were the emissaries to the former [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] in the far north, while [[Menachem Nachum Twersky]] headed to [[Chernobyl]] in the east and [[Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev]] remained nearby. Elimelech of Lizhensk, his brother [[Zusha of Hanipol]] and [[Yisroel Hopsztajn]] established the sect in [[Polish Crown|Poland proper]]. Vitebsk and [[Abraham Kalisker]] later led a small ascension to the [[Land of Israel]], establishing a Hasidic presence in the [[Galilee]].\n\nThe spread of Hasidism also incurred organized opposition. Rabbi [[Elijah of Vilna|Elijah of Vilnius]], one the greatest authorities of the generation and a ''hasid'' and secret kabbalist of the old style, was deeply suspicious of their emphasis on mysticism rather than mundane Torah study, threat to established communal authority, resemblance to the Sabbatean movement and other details he considered infractions. In April 1772, He and the Vilnius community wardens launched a systematic campaign against the sect, placing an [[Herem (censure)|anathema]] upon them, banishing their leaders and sending letters denouncing the movement. Further excommunication followed in [[Brody]] and other cities. In 1781, during a second round of hostilities, the books of Jacob Joseph were burned in Vilnius. Another cause for strife emerged when the Hasidim adopted the [[Lurianic]] prayer rite, which they revised somewhat to [[Nusach Sefard]]; the first edition in Eastern Europe was printed in 1781 and received approbation from the anti-Hasidic scholars of Brody, but the sect quickly embraced the Kabbalah-infused tome and popularized it, making it their symbol. Their rivals, named ''[[Misnagdim]]'', \"opponents\" (a generic term which acquired an independent meaning as Hasidism grew stronger) soon accused them of abandoning the traditional [[Nusach Ashkenaz]].\n\nIn 1798, Opponents made accusations of espionage against [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] and he was imprisoned by the Russian government for two months. Excoriatory polemics were printed and anathemas declared in the entire region. But Elijah's death in 1797 denied the ''Misnagdim'' their powerful leader. In 1804, [[Alexander I of Russia]] allowed independent prayer groups to operate, the chief vessel through which the movement spread from town to town. The failure to eradicate Hasidism, which acquired a clear self-identity in the struggle and greatly expanded throughout it, convinced its adversaries to adopt a more passive method of resistance, as exemplified by [[Chaim of Volozhin]]. The growing conservatism of the new movement \u2013 which at some occasions drew close to Kabbalah-based antinomian phraseology, as did the Sabbateans, but never crossed the threshold and remained thoroughly observant \u2013 and the rise of common enemies slowly brought a rapprochement, and by the second half of the 19th century both sides basically considered each other legitimate.\n\nThe turn of the century saw several prominent new, fourth-generation ''tzaddiqim''. Upon Elimelech's death in the [[Partitions of Poland|now-partitioned Poland]], his place in [[Habsburg Galicia]] was assumed by [[Menachem Mendel of Rimanov]], who was deeply hostile to the modernization the Austrian rulers attempted to force on the traditional Jewish society (though this same process also allowed his sect to flourish, as communal authority was severely weakened). The rabbi of Rimanov hearkened the alliance the hasidim would form with the most conservative elements of the Jewish public. In Central Poland, the new leader was Jacob Isaac Horowiz, the \"[[Seer of Lublin]]\", who was of a particularly populist bent and appealed to the common folk with miracle working and little strenuous spiritual demands. The Seer's senior acolyte, [[Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz|Jacob Isaac Rabinovitz]] the \"Holy Jew\" of [[Przysucha]], gradually dismissed his mentor's approach as overly vulgar and adopted a more aesthetic and scholarly approach, virtually without theurgy to the masses. The Holy Jew's \"Przysucha School\" was continued by his successor [[Simcha Bunim]] and especially the reclusive, morose [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk]]. The most controversial fourth-generation ''tzaddiq'' was the Podolia-based [[Nachman of Breslov]], who denounced his peers for becoming too institutionalized, much like the old establishment their predecessors challenged decades before, and espoused an anti-rationalist, pessimistic spiritual teaching, very different from the prevalent stress on joy.\n\n=== Routinization ===\n[[File:Sadigura rebbe's palace.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Palace of the Ruzhin dynasty in [[Sadhora]].]]\n\nThe opening of the 19th century saw the Hasidic sect transformed. Once a rising force outside the establishment, the ''tzaddiqim'' now became an important and often dominant power in most of Eastern Europe. The slow process of encroachment, which mostly begun with forming an independent ''Shtibel'' and culminated in the Righteous becoming an authority figure (either alongside or above the official rabbinate) for the entire community, overwhelmed many towns even in ''Misnagdic'' stronghold of Lithuania, far more so in [[Congress Poland]] and the vast majority in Podolia, Volhynia and Galicia. It began to make inroads into [[Bukovina]], [[Bessarabia]] and the westernmost frontier of autochthonic pre-WWII Hasidism, in [[Unterlander Jews|northeastern Hungary]], where the Seer's disciple [[Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel)|Moses Teitelbaum (I)]] was appointed in [[Ujhely]].\n\nLess than three generations after the Besht's death, the sect grew to encompass hundreds of thousands by 1830. As a mass movement, a clear stratification emerged between the court's functionaries and permanent residents (''yoshvim'', \"sitters\"), the devoted followers who would often visit the Righteous on Sabbath, and the large public which prayed at Sefard Rite synagogues and was minimally affiliated.\n\nAll this was followed by a more conservative approach and power bickering among the Righteous. Since the Maggid's death, none could claim the overall leadership. Among the several dozens active, each ruled over his own turf, and local traditions and customs began to emerge in the various courts which developed their own identity. The high mystical tension typical of a new movement subsided, and was soon replaced by more hierarchical, orderly atmosphere.\n\nThe most important aspect of the routinization Hasidism underwent was the adoption of dynasticism. The first to claim legitimacy by right of descent from the Besht was his grandson, [[Boruch of Medzhybizh]], appointed 1782. He held a lavish court with [[Hershel of Ostropol]] as jester, and demanded the other Righteous acknowledge his supremacy. Upon the death of [[Menachem Nachum Twersky]] of [[Chernobyl]], his son [[Mordechai Twersky]] succeeded him. The principle was conclusively affirmed in the great dispute after Liadi's demise in 1813: his senior acolyte [[Aharon HaLevi of Strashelye]] was defeated by his son, [[Dovber Schneuri]], whose offspring [[Chabad|retained the title for 181 years]].\n\nBy the 1860s, virtually all courts were dynastic. Rather than single ''tzaddiqim'' with followings of their own, each sect would command a base of rank-and-file hasidim attached not just to the individual leader, but to the bloodline and the court's unique attributes. [[Israel Friedman of Ruzhyn]] insisted on royal splendour, resided in a palace and his six sons all inherited some of his followers. With the constraints of maintaining their gains replacing the dynamism of the past, the Righteous or ''Rebbe''s/''Admorim'' also silently retreated from the overt, radical mysticism of their predecessors. While populist miracle working for the masses remained a key theme in many dynasties, a new type of \"Rebbe-Rabbi\" emerged, one who was both a completely traditional ''[[halakhic]]'' authority as well as a spiritualist. The tension with the ''Misnagdim'' subsided significantly.<ref name=\"RAD\">Benjamin Brown, [https://www.academia.edu/4900677/ The Two Faces of Religious Radicalism - Orthodox Zealotry and Holy Sinning in Nineteenth Century Hasidism in Hungary and Galicia].</ref><ref>Stephen Sharot, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1386127 Hasidism and the Routinization of Charisma], Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1980</ref>\n\nBut it was an external threat, more than anything else, that mended relations. While traditional Jewish society remained well entrenched in backward Eastern Europe, reports of the rapid acculturation and religious laxity in the West troubled both camps. When the ''[[Haskalah]]'', the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], appeared in Galicia and Congress Poland in the 1810s, it was soon perceived as a dire threat. The ''maskilim'' themselves detested Hasidism as an anti-rationalist and barbaric phenomenon, as did Western Jews of all shades, including the most right-wing Orthodox such as Rabbi [[Azriel Hildesheimer]].<ref>[[David Ellenson]], ''Rabbi Esriel Hildesheimer and the Creation of a Modern Jewish Orthodoxy''. University of Alabama Press, 1990. p. 44.</ref> In Galicia especially, hostility towards it defined the ''Haskalah'' to a large extent, from the staunchly observant Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes]] and [[Joseph Perl]] to the radical anti-Talmudists like [[Osias Schorr]]. The Enlightened, who [[Revival of the Hebrew language|revived Hebrew grammar]], often mocked their rivals' lack of eloquence in the language. While a considerable proportion of the ''Misnagdim'' were not adverse to at least some of the ''Haskala'''s goals, the ''Rebbe''s were unremittingly hostile.\n\nThe most distinguished Hasidic leader in Galicia in the era was [[Chaim Halberstam]], who combined talmudic erudition and the status of a major [[posek|decisor]] with his function as ''tzaddiq''. He symbolized the new era, brokering peace between the small Hasidic sect in Hungary to its opponents. At that country, where modernization and assimilation were much more imminent than in the East, the local Righteous joined forces with those now termed [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] against the rising liberals. Rabbi [[Moses Sofer]] of [[Pressburg]], while no friend to Hasidism, tolerated it as he combated the forces which sought modernization of the Jews; a generation later, in the 1860s, the ''Rebbe''s and the zealot ultra-Orthodox [[Hillel Lichtenstein]] allied closely.\n\nAround the mid-19th century, over a hundred dynastic courts related by marriage were the main religious power in the territory enclosed between Hungary, former Lithuania, Prussia and inner Russia, with considerable presence in the former two. In Central Poland, the pragmatist, rationalist Przysucha school thrived: [[Yitzchak Meir Alter]] founded the [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|court of Ger]] in 1859, and in 1876 [[Jechiel Danziger]] established [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Alexander]]. In Galicia and Hungary, apart from Halberstam's House of [[Sanz]], [[Tzvi Hirsh of Zidichov]]'s descendants each pursued a mystical approach in the dynasties of [[Zidichov (Hasidic dynasty)|Zidichov]], [[Komarno (Hasidic dynasty)|Komarno]] and so forth. In 1817, [[Sholom Rokeach]] became the first ''Rebbe'' of [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]]. At [[Bukovina]], the Hager line of [[Kosov (Hasidic dynasty)|Kosov]]-[[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz]] was the largest court.\n\nThe ''Haskalah'' was always a minor force, but the [[Jewish national movements (disambiguation)|Jewish national movements]] which emerged in the 1880s, as well as Socialism, proved much more appealing to the young. Progressive strata condemned Hasidism as a primitive relic, strong, but doomed to disappear, as Eastern European Jewry underwent slow yet steady secularization. The gravity of the situation was attested to by the foundation of Hasidic [[yeshiva]]s (in the modern, boarding school-equivalent sense) to enculturate the young and preserve their loyalty: The first was established at [[Nowy Wi\u015bnicz]] by Rabbi [[Shlomo Halberstam (I)]] in 1881. These institutions were originally utilized by the ''Misnagdim'' to inoculate their youth from Hasidic influence, but now, the latter faced a similar crisis. One of the most contentious issues in this respect was [[Zionism]]; the Ruzhin dynasties were quite favourably disposed toward it, while Hungarian and Galician courts reviled it.\n\n=== Calamity and renaissance ===\nOutside pressure was mounting in the early 20th century. In 1912, many Hasidic leaders partook in the creation of the [[World Agudath Israel|Agudas Israel]] party, a political instrument intended to safeguard what was now named [[Orthodox Judaism]] even in the relatively traditional East; the more hard-line dynasties, mainly Galician and Hungarian, opposed the Aguda as too lenient. Mass immigration to America, urbanization, [[World War I]] and the subsequent [[Russian Civil War]] uprooted the ''[[shtetl]]''s in which the local Jews lived for centuries and were the bedrock of Hasidism. In the new [[Soviet Union]], civil equality first achieved and a harsh repression of religion caused a rapid secularization. Few remaining Hasidim, especially of [[Chabad]], continued to practice underground for decades. In the new states of the [[Interbellum]] era, the process was only somewhat slower. On the eve of [[World War II]], strictly observant Jews were estimated to constitute no more than a third of the total Jewish population in Poland, the world's most Orthodox country.<ref>Jaff Schatz, ''Jews and the Communist Movement in Interwar Poland'', in: ''Dark Times, Dire Decisions : Jews and Communism''. Oxford University Press (2005). p. 36.</ref> While the Rebbes still had a vast base of support, it was aging and declining.\n\nThe [[Holocaust]] hit the Hasidim, easily identifiable and almost unable to disguise themselves among the larger populace due to cultural insularity, particularly hard. Hundreds of leaders perished with their flock, while the flight of many notable ones as their followers were being exterminated \u2013 especially [[Aharon Rokeach]] of Belz and [[Joel Teitelbaum]] of Satmar \u2013 elicited bitter recrimination. In the immediate post-war years, the entire movement seemed to teeter on the precipice of oblivion. In Israel, the United States, and Western Europe, the survivors' children were at best becoming [[Modern Orthodox]]. While a century earlier the ''Haskalah'' depicted it as a medieval, malicious power, now it was so weakened that the popular cultural image was sentimental and romantic, what [[Joseph Dan]] termed \"Frumkinian Hasidism\" for it began with the short stories of [[Michael Levi Rodkinson]] (Frumkin). [[Martin Buber]] was the major contributor to this trend, portraying the sect as a model of a healthy folk consciousness. \"Frumkinian\" style was very influential, later inspiring the so-called \"[[Neo-Hasidism]]\", and also utterly ahistorical.<ref name=\"Dan\">Joseph Dan, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23364585 The End of the Frumkinian Hasidism]'', Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought, Volume 15, pp. 261-274.</ref>\n\nYet, the movement proved more resilient than expected. Talented and charismatic Hasidic masters emerged, who reinvigorated their following and drew new crowds. In New York, the [[Satmar Rebbe]] Joel Teitelbaum formulated a fiercely anti-Zionist [[Holocaust theology]] and founded an insular, self-sufficient community which attracted many immigrants from Greater Hungary; already by 1961, 40% of families were newcomers.<ref>Israel Rubin. ''Satmar: Two Generations of an Urban Island''. P. Lang (1997). p. 42</ref> [[Yisrael Alter]] of [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]] created robust institutions, fortified his court's standing in ''Agudas Israel'' and held ''tisch'' every week for 29 years. He halted the hemorrhage of his followers and retrieved many Litvaks (the contemporary, less adverse epithet for ''Misnagdim'') and [[Religious Zionists]] whose parents were Gerrer Hasidim before the war. Chaim Meir Hager similarly restored [[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz]]. Moses Isaac Gewirtzman founded the new [[Pshevorsk (Hasidic dynasty)]] in [[Antwerp]].\n\nThe most explosive growth was experienced in [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], whose head [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] adopted a modern (he and his disciples ceased wearing the customary [[Shtreimel]]) and outreach-centered orientation. At a time when most Orthodox and Hasidim in particular rejected proselytization, he turned his sect into a mechanism devoted almost solely to it, blurring the difference between actual Hasidim and loosely affiliated supporters until researchers could scarcely define it as a regular Hasidic group. Another phenomenon was the revival of [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], which remained without an acting ''Tzaddiq'' since the rebellious [[Rebbe Nachman]]'s 1810 death. Its complex, existentialist philosophy drew many to it.\n\nExorbitant fertility rates, increasing tolerance and [[multiculturalism]] on behalf of surrounding society, and the great wave of [[Baal teshuva movement|newcomers to Orthodox Judaism]] which began in the 1970s all cemented the movement's status as very much alive and thriving. The clearest indication for that, noted Joseph Dan, was the disappearance of the \"Frumkinian\" narrative which inspired much sympathy towards it from non-Orthodox Jews and others, as actual Hasidism returned to the fore. It was replaced by apprehension and concern due to the growing presence of the reclusive, strictly religious Hasidic lifestyle in the public sphere, especially in Israel.<ref name=\"Dan\"/> As numbers grew, \"courts\" were again torn apart by schisms between Rebbes' sons vying for power, a common occurrence during the golden age of the 19th century.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=60em}}\n*{{Cite book\n\n |last= Elior\n |first=Rachel\n |title=The Mystical Origins of Hasidism\n |year=2006\n |publisher=Littman Library of Jewish Civilization\n |isbn=978-1-904113-04-1\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n\n |last=Buber\n |first=Martin\n| authorlink = Martin Buber\n |others=translated by Olga Marx; foreword by [[Chaim Potok]]\n |title=Tales of the Hasidim\n |origyear=1947\n| edition = Paperback: 2 volumes in 1\n |date= July 23, 1991\n |publisher=[[Schocken Books]]\n |location=New York\n |isbn=0-8052-0995-6 |lccn=90052921\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n\n |last= Berger\n |first=Joseph\n |title=The Pious Ones: The World of Hasidim and Their Battle with America\n |year=2014\n |publisher=Harper Perennial\n |isbn=978-0-06-212334-3\n}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscategory}}\n* {{Cite NIE|wstitle=Chasidim |year=1905 |short=x}}\n* [http://www.routledge.com/textbooks/0415236614/resources/maps/map50.jpg Map of the spread of Hasidism from 1730 and 1760\u201375, and its encroachment on the Lithuanian centre of Rabbinic opposition]\n\n{{Hasidic dynasties}}\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hasidic Judaism| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish movements]]", "sha1": "dcs43qfyu55mg195702lrd1o2aue2wr"}}, {"title": "Harmonic series (music)", "ns": "0", "id": "14439", "revision": {"id": "860093158", "parentid": "850049049", "timestamp": "2018-09-18T08:51:23Z", "contributor": {"username": "Joefromrandb", "id": "13568690"}, "comment": "article is already disambiguated", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[Image:Harmonic partials on strings.svg|thumb|250px|Harmonics of a string showing the periods of the harmonics (period = 1/frequency)]]\n\nA '''harmonic series''' is the sequence of sounds<ref>IEV 1994, sound: http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&ievref=801-21-01 .</ref>&mdash;pure tones, represented by sinusoidal waves&mdash;in which the frequency<ref>IEV 1994, fundamental: http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&ievref=801-30-01\n .</ref> of each sound is an [[integer]] multiple of the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]], the lowest frequency.<ref>IEV 1994, harmonic series of sounds: http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&ievref=801-30-04 .</ref>\n\n[[Definite pitch|Pitched]] [[musical instrument]]s are often based on an acoustic [[resonator]] such as a string or a column of air, which oscillates at numerous modes simultaneously. At the frequencies of each vibrating mode, waves travel in both directions along the string or air column, reinforcing and canceling each other to form [[standing wave]]s. Interaction with the surrounding air causes audible [[sound waves]], which travel away from the instrument. Because of the typical spacing of the [[resonance]]s, these frequencies are mostly limited to integer multiples, or [[harmonic]]s, of the lowest frequency, and such multiples form the harmonic series (see [[harmonic series (mathematics)]]).\n\nThe musical [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of a note is usually perceived as the lowest [[#Partial|partial]] present (the fundamental frequency), which may be the one created by [[vibration]] over the full length of the string or air column, or a higher harmonic chosen by the player. The musical [[timbre]] of a steady tone from such an instrument is strongly affected by the relative strength of each harmonic.\n\n== Terminology {{anchor|Partial}} ==\n\n===Partial, harmonic, fundamental, inharmonicity, and overtone===\n\nA \"complex tone\" (the sound of a note with a timbre particular to the instrument playing the note) \"can be described as a combination of many simple periodic waves (i.e., [[sine wave]]s) or ''partials,'' each with its own frequency of vibration, amplitude, and [[Phase (waves)|phase]].\"<ref>{{cite book | title = Music, Thought, and Feeling: Understanding the Psychology of Music | author = William Forde Thompson | isbn = 978-0-19-537707-1 | page = 46 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Psychology/CognitivePsychology/?view=usa&ci=9780195377071 }}</ref> (See also, [[Fourier analysis]].)\n\nA '''''partial''''' is any of the sine waves (or \"simple tones\", as Ellis calls them when translating Helmholtz) of which a complex tone is composed, not necessarily with an integer multiple of the lowest harmonic.\n\nA '''''harmonic''''' is any member of the harmonic series, an ideal set of frequencies that are positive integer multiples of a common [[fundamental frequency]]. The '''''fundamental''''' is obviously a harmonic because it is 1 times itself. A '''''harmonic partial''''' is any real partial component of a complex tone that matches (or nearly matches) an ideal harmonic.<ref>{{cite book | title = Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound | author = [[John R.

''[[Inharmonicity]]'' is a measure of the deviation of a partial from the closest ideal harmonic, typically measured in [[cent (music)|cents]] for each partial.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Historical Harpsichord Volume Two: The Metallurgy of 17th- and 18th- Century Music Wire | author = [[Martha Goodway]] and Jay Scott Odell | publisher = Pendragon Press | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-918728-54-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sE1mk8ed1dkC&pg=PA93&dq=inharmonicity+defined+partial+frequencies}}</ref>\n\nMany [[Definite pitch|pitched]] acoustic instruments are designed to have partials that are close to being whole-number ratios with very low inharmonicity; therefore, in music theory, and in instrument design, it is convenient, although not strictly accurate, to speak of the partials in those instruments' sounds as \"harmonics\", even though they may have some degree of inharmonicity. The piano, one of the most important instruments of western tradition, contains a certain degree of inharmonicity among the frequencies generated by each string. Other pitched instruments, especially certain [[percussion]] instruments, such as [[marimba]], [[vibraphone]], [[tubular bell]]s, [[timpani]], and [[singing bowl]]s contain mostly inharmonic partials, yet may give the ear a good sense of pitch because of a few strong partials that resemble harmonics. Unpitched, or indefinite-pitched instruments, such as cymbals, gongs, or tam-tams make sounds (produce spectra) that are rich in inharmonic partials and may give no impression of implying any particular pitch.\n\nAn '''''[[overtone]]''''' is any partial above the lowest partial. The term overtone does not imply harmonicity or inharmonicity and has no other special meaning other than to exclude the fundamental. It is mostly the relative strength of the different overtones that give an instrument its particular timbre, tone color, or character. When writing or speaking of overtones and partials numerically, care must be taken to designate each correctly to avoid any confusion of one for the other, so the second overtone may not be the third partial, because it is the second sound in a series.<ref>\nRiemann by Shedlock 1876, p. 143:<br> \n\u00ablet it be understood, the second overtone is not the third tone of the series, but the second\u00bb\n</ref>\n \nSome electronic instruments, such as [[synthesizer]]s, can play a pure frequency with no overtones (a sine wave). Synthesizers can also combine pure frequencies into more complex tones, such as to simulate other instruments. Certain flutes and ocarinas are very nearly without overtones.\n\n==Frequencies, wavelengths, and musical intervals in example systems==\n[[File:Harmonic series to 32.png|350px|thumb|String harmonics to 32]]\n\nThe simplest case to visualise is a vibrating string, as in the illustration; the string has fixed points at each end, and each harmonic [[normal mode|mode]] divides it into 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., equal-sized sections resonating at increasingly higher frequencies.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Physics and Psychophysics of Music | author = Juan G. Roederer | isbn = 0-387-94366-8 | page = 106 | year = 1995 }}</ref> Similar arguments apply to vibrating air columns in wind instruments (for example, \"the French horn was originally a valveless instrument that could play only the notes of the harmonic series\"<ref>Kostka, Stefan and Payne, Dorothy (1995). ''Tonal Harmony'', p.102. Third edition. McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-035874-5}}.</ref>), although these are complicated by having the possibility of anti-nodes (that is, the air column is closed at one end and open at the other), [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] as opposed to [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] [[bore (wind instruments)|bore]]s, or end-openings that run the gamut from no flare, cone flare, or exponentially shaped flares (such as in various bells).\n\nIn most pitched musical instruments, the fundamental (first harmonic) is accompanied by other, higher-frequency harmonics. Thus shorter-wavelength, higher-frequency [[wave]]s occur with varying prominence and give each instrument its characteristic tone quality. The fact that a string is fixed at each end means that the longest allowed wavelength on the string (which gives the fundamental frequency) is twice the length of the string (one round trip, with a half cycle fitting between the nodes at the two ends). Other allowed  wavelengths are 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, etc. times that of the fundamental.\n\nTheoretically, these shorter wavelengths correspond to [[vibrations]] at frequencies that are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc., times the fundamental frequency. Physical characteristics of the vibrating medium and/or the resonator it vibrates against often alter these frequencies. (See [[inharmonicity]] and [[stretched tuning]] for alterations specific to wire-stringed instruments and certain electric pianos.) However, those alterations are small, and except for precise, highly specialized tuning, it is reasonable to think of the frequencies of the harmonic series as integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.\n\nThe harmonic series is an [[arithmetic series]] (1\u00d7f, 2\u00d7f, 3\u00d7f, 4\u00d7f, 5\u00d7f, ...). In terms of frequency (measured in cycles per second, or [[hertz]] (Hz) where f is the fundamental frequency), the difference between consecutive harmonics is therefore constant and equal to the fundamental. But because human ears respond to sound nonlinearly, higher harmonics are perceived as \"closer together\" than lower ones. On the other hand, the [[octave]] series is a [[geometric progression]] (2\u00d7f, 4\u00d7f, 8\u00d7f, 16\u00d7f, ...), and people hear these distances as \"the same\" in the sense of musical interval. In terms of what one hears, each octave in the harmonic series is divided into increasingly \"smaller\" and more numerous intervals.\n\nThe second harmonic, whose frequency is twice of the fundamental, sounds an octave higher; the third harmonic, three times the frequency of the fundamental, sounds a [[perfect fifth]] above the second harmonic. The fourth harmonic vibrates at four times the frequency of the fundamental and sounds a [[perfect fourth]] above the third harmonic (two octaves above the fundamental). Double the harmonic number means double the frequency (which sounds an octave higher).\n\n<!--image shown wider than 400px to display detail-->\n[[Image:Harmonic Series.png|thumb|center|800px|An illustration of the harmonic series in musical notation.

This objective structure is augmented by psychoacoustic phenomena. For example, a perfect fifth, say 200 and 300&nbsp;Hz (cycles per second), causes a listener to perceive a [[combination tone]] of 100&nbsp;Hz (the difference between 300&nbsp;Hz and 200&nbsp;Hz); that is, an octave below the lower (actual sounding) note. This 100&nbsp;Hz first-order combination tone then interacts with both notes of the interval to produce second-order combination tones of 200 (300&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;100) and 100 (200&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;100) Hz and all further nth-order combination tones are all the same, being formed from various subtraction of 100, 200, and 300. When one contrasts this with a dissonant interval such as a [[tritone]](not tempered) with a frequency ratio of 7:5 one gets, for example, 700&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;500&nbsp;=&nbsp;200 (1st order combination tone) and 500&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;200&nbsp;=&nbsp;300 (2nd order). The rest of the combination tones are octaves of 100&nbsp;Hz so the 7:5 interval actually contains 4&nbsp;notes: 100&nbsp;Hz (and its octaves), 300&nbsp;Hz, 500&nbsp;Hz and 700&nbsp;Hz. Note that the lowest combination tone (100&nbsp;Hz) is a 17th (2&nbsp;octaves and a [[major third]]) below the lower (actual sounding) note of the [[tritone]]. All the intervals succumb to similar analysis as has been demonstrated by [[Paul Hindemith]] in his book ''The Craft of Musical Composition'', although he rejected the use of harmonics from the 7th and beyond.<ref name=\"Hindemith\"/>\n\nThe [[Mixolydian mode|mixolydian mode]] is consonant with the first 10 harmonics of the harmonic series (the 11th harmonic, a tritone, is not in the mixolydian mode).  The [[Ionian mode|ionian mode]] is consonant with only the first 6 harmonics of the series (the 7th harmonic, a minor seventh, is not in the ionian mode).\n\n== Timbre of musical instruments ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe relative [[amplitude]]s (strengths) of the various harmonics primarily determine the [[timbre]] of different instruments and sounds, though onset [[transient (acoustics)|transients]], [[formant]]s, [[noise]]s, and inharmonicities also play a role. For example, the [[clarinet]] and [[saxophone]] have similar [[mouthpiece (woodwind)|mouthpiece]]s and [[reed (music)|reeds]], and both produce sound through [[resonance]] of air inside a chamber whose mouthpiece end is considered closed. Because the clarinet's resonator is cylindrical, the even-numbered harmonics are less present. The saxophone's resonator is conical, which allows the even-numbered harmonics to sound more strongly and thus produces a more complex tone. The [[inharmonicity|inharmonic]] ringing of the instrument's metal resonator is even more prominent in the sounds of brass instruments.\n\nHuman ears tend to group phase-coherent, harmonically-related frequency components into a single sensation. Rather than perceiving the individual partials\u2013harmonic and inharmonic, of a musical tone, humans perceive them together as a tone color or timbre, and the overall [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is heard as the fundamental of the harmonic series being experienced. If a sound is heard that is made up of even just a few simultaneous sine tones, and if the intervals among those tones form part of a harmonic series, the brain tends to group this input into a sensation of the pitch of the fundamental of that series, [[Missing fundamental|even if the fundamental is not present]].\n\nVariations in the frequency of harmonics can also affect the ''perceived'' fundamental pitch. These variations, most clearly documented in the [[piano]] and other stringed instruments but also apparent in [[brass instrument]]s, are caused by a combination of metal stiffness and the interaction of the vibrating air or string with the resonating body of the instrument.\n\n==Interval strength==\n\n[[David Cope]] (1997) suggests the concept of [[Interval (music)#Consonant and dissonant|interval strength]],<ref name=\"Cope\">[[David Cope|Cope, David]] (1997). ''Techniques of the Contemporary Composer'', p. 40\u201341. New York, New York: Schirmer Books. {{ISBN|0-02-864737-8}}.</ref> in which an interval's strength, consonance, or stability (see [[consonance and dissonance]]) is determined by its approximation to a lower and stronger, or higher and weaker, position in the harmonic series. See also: [[Lipps\u2013Meyer law]].\n\nThus, an equal-tempered perfect fifth ({{Audio|perfect fifth on C.mid|play}}) is stronger than an equal-tempered [[minor third]] ({{Audio|minor third on C.mid|play}}), since they approximate a just perfect fifth ({{Audio|just perfect fifth on C.mid|play}}) and just minor third ({{Audio|just minor third on C.mid|play}}), respectively. The just minor third appears between harmonics 5 and 6 while the just fifth appears lower, between harmonics 2 and 3.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Harmonic series}}\n*[[Fourier series]]\n*[[Inharmonicity]]\n*[[Klang (music)]]\n*[[Lesiba]]\n*[[Otonality and Utonality]]\n*[[Piano acoustics]]\n*[[Scale of harmonics]]\n*[[Stretched tuning]]\n*[[Subharmonic]]\n*[[Undertone series]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web|last=Coul|first=Manuel Op de|title=List of intervals (Compiled)\n|url=http://www.huygens-fokker.org/docs/intervals.html|accessdate=2016-06-15|year=|publisher=Huygens-Fokker Foundation centre for microtonal music|language=|quote=}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Datta A.

In classic [[Rabbinic literature]] it differs from \"[[Tzadik]]\"-\"righteous\", by instead denoting one who goes beyond the legal requirements of ritual and ethical [[Halacha|Jewish observance]] in daily life. The literal meaning of \"Hasid\" derives from [[Chesed]]-\"kindness\", the outward expression of love for God and other people. This spiritual devotion motivates pious conduct beyond everyday limits. The devotional nature of its description lent itself to a few Jewish movements in history being known as \"Hasidim\". Two of these derived from the Jewish [[Jewish mysticism|mystical tradition]], as it could tend towards piety over legalism.\n\nAs a personal honorific, both \"Hasid\" and \"Tzadik\" could be applied independently to the same individual with both different qualities. The 18th-century [[Vilna Gaon]], for instance, at that time the chief [[Misnagdim|opponent]] of the new Jewish mystical movement that became known as \"[[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]\", was renowned for his righteous life. In tribute to his scholarship, he became popularly honored with the formal title of \"[[Gaon (Hebrew)|Genius]]\", while amongst the Hasidic movement's leadership, despite his fierce opposition to their legalistic tendencies, he was respectfully referred to as \"The [[Gaon (Hebrew)|Gaon]], the Hasid from Vilna\".\n\nIn the aggregate, it may refer to members of any of the following Jewish movements:\n* [[Hasideans]], pietists or \"Jewish Puritans\" of the Maccabean period, around the 2nd century BCE\n* [[Chassidei Ashkenaz]], ascetic German mystical-ethical pietists of the 12th and 13th centuries\n\n[[Category:Hebrew words and phrases]]", "sha1": "g0h48pao0fzm44sbzpjkbkjlvp43wcb"}}, {"title": "History of post-communist Rusia", "ns": "0", "id": "14442", "redirect": {"title": "History of Russia (1991\u2013present)"}, "revision": {"id": "716091280", "parentid": "379171526", "timestamp": "2016-04-19T20:59:06Z", "contributor": {"username": "Xqbot", "id": "8066546"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Bot: Fixing double redirect to [[History of Russia (1991\u2013present)]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[History of Russia (1991\u2013present)]]", "sha1": "7fgu208m16zpvbgfydee699ehysph0x"}}, {"title": "Hoosier Hysteria", "ns": "0", "id": "14443", "revision": {"id": "851215470", "parentid": "850905461", "timestamp": "2018-07-20T20:53:42Z", "contributor": {"username": "Dale Arnett", "id": "25667"}, "comment": "/* Local basketball stars */ OG Anunoby: Played at IU.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Hoosier Hysteria''' is the state of excitement surrounding [[basketball]] in [[Indiana]], or more specifically the [[Indiana High School Boy's Basketball Tournament|Indiana high school basketball tournament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihigh.com/100/article_23210.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713005802/http://www.ihigh.com/100/article_23210.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}</ref> In part, the excitement stemmed from the inclusion of all tournament entrants into the same tournament, where a small town's [[David]] might knock off a large city's [[Goliath]]. The most famous example occurred in 1954, when [[1954 Milan High School basketball team|Milan]] (enrollment 161) defeated [[Muncie Central High School|Muncie Central]] (enrollment over 1,600) to win the State title. The plot of the now famous movie, ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]'', was based on the story of the 1954 Milan team and seems to typify the hysteria related to basketball in the state of Indiana.\n\nIndiana's passion for basketball was observed and written about by basketball's inventor, [[James Naismith]]. In 1925, Naismith visited an Indiana basketball state finals game along with 15,000 screaming fans and later wrote, that while it was invented in [[Massachusetts]], \"basketball really had its origin in Indiana, which remains the center of the sport.\" [[Hoosier]]s have a traditional love for basketball similar to that of [[White Southerners|Southerners]] or [[Ohio]]ans for [[American football|football]], [[Pennsylvania]]ns for [[Collegiate Wrestling|wrestling]], and [[Minnesota]]ns for [[ice hockey]].\n\n== High school basketball ==\n\n===Homegrown talent===\nIndiana high schools boast a tradition of producing top caliber basketball players.  Through the 2009-2010 NBA season, 152 Hoosier athletes have played professional basketball in the world's top league.  Considering the size of the state (population 6.4 million),<ref name=09CenEst>{{cite web | title = Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2009 | publisher = United States Census Bureau | accessdate = 2010-01-04 | url = https://www.census.gov/popest/states/tables/NST-EST2009-01.csv}}</ref> this makes Indiana high schools by far the most successful at developing NBA players per capita.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/high_schools.cgi?state=IN |title=NBA & ABA Players Who Attended High School in Indiana |website=Basketball-Reference.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2017-03-27}}</ref>  Today there are 22 Hoosiers in the NBA - more than one for every 150,000 male residents. The state's unparalleled ability to produce NBA talent, both statewide and specifically in smaller towns, is featured in this [http://deadspin.com/infographics-where-do-pro-basketball-players-come-from-513261549 Deadspin article]. In 2017, Indiana natives won the NBA and D-league Dunk Contests, NBA and D-league 3-pont contests, and won runner-up in the NBA Skills Challenge.\n\n===One-class tradition===\nHistorically, each of the several hundred small towns of Indiana had its own small school system. Before consolidation of many of these rural school districts in the last half of the twentieth century, Indiana high schools had fewer students than those of most other states; basketball was a natural game for these schools since it only required five starters and a few reserves. Even one or two great basketball players could make a high school team a powerhouse, and nearly every Indiana town dreamt of such glory.\n\nThe [[Franklin Wonder Five]] was the first team to win the state championship in three consecutive years, from 1920-1922.  This accomplishment would not be matched for over six decades.  The team was led by [[Fuzzy Vandivier]].\n\nAfter Milan's Miracle in the 1950s, no school with an enrollment of less than 500 won another boys' State title under the all-comers format. As [[school]] consolidation became more common and as more [[rural]] residents migrated to cities making large high schools grow even larger, smaller high schools had only a mismatch to look forward to come [[tournament]] time, as success concentrated in Indiana's large [[Urban area|urban]] and [[suburban]] schools. Starting with the 1997-1998 season, Indiana established a controversial four-class system for its basketball championship, although many other sports remain single-class. The state's move to this new system has, to some extent, diminished the phenomenon and public opinion is widely split on the merits of \"class basketball.\"\n\nAside from the \"Milan Miracle,\" the story of [[Crispus Attucks High School]] ranks as one of the greatest in Indiana high school basketball tradition. In 1955, the year after Attucks had lost in the semistate final (state quarterfinals) to Milan's championship team, Attucks gained fame by winning the Indiana state championship, becoming the first all-black school in the nation to win a state title open to all schools regardless of race. Crispus Attucks repeated as champions in 1956, becoming the first Indiana high school team to complete a season undefeated. The Attucks teams of 1954 through 1956 were led by [[Oscar Robertson]]. Both stories, Milan and Crispus Attucks, are memorialized for their accomplishments and tradition at the [[Indiana State Museum]] as well as at the [[Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame]] in [[New Castle, Indiana]].\n\nA highlight of the single-class tournament was the 1990 State Championship game, in which the paid attendance was over 40,000 fans.  This phenomenal turnout of fans who witnessed [[Damon Bailey]]'s Bedford-North Lawrence Stars win the State Championship stands as the largest crowd ever to witness a high school basketball game.\n\nAfter the 1997 season (when Bloomington North won the final single-class State Championship), the IHSAA controversially did away with the single-class system, ending the run of single-class champions in Indiana.  There are many in Indiana who lament this loss, and who know that Hoosier Hysteria has been dramatically and significantly lessened thereby. Hoosier Hysteria has not completely diminished however. For example, in 2003, DeKalb High School (1200 students) nearly defeated Pike High School (3000) students).  Also, the Indiana tournament is still the most attended in the nation, with final four games for the two larger divisions regularly selling out [[Bankers Life Fieldhouse]] (formerly Conseco Fieldhouse).\n\n===High school gymnasiums===\n{{see also|Largest high school gyms in the United States}}\nPerhaps one of the more telling signs of the passion and commitment to basketball at the high school level is the number and size of large basketball [[gym]]nasiums in the state. With considerable cost and effort, Indiana boasts nine of the ten largest high school gyms in the country,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/basketball/2004-02-25-ten-great-hoops-newcastle_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Sal | last1=Ruibal | title=High school hoops cathedral | date=2004-02-27}}</ref> and a purported eighteen of the top twenty.

In [[NCAA]] Division I basketball, Indiana's colleges and universities have a storied past. [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] rivals [[Purdue University]] and [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] are the most notable, with national and conference championships to boast. Smaller schools such as the [[University of Notre Dame]], [[Indiana State University]], [[Ball State University]], [[Butler University]], the [[University of Evansville]], [[IUPUI]], [[Purdue University Fort Wayne|Purdue Fort Wayne]], and [[Valparaiso University]] add to the mix. [[Vincennes University]] boasts an outstanding national tradition in the junior college ranks.  And in Division II [[St. Joseph's College (Indiana)|St. Joseph's]], [[University of Indianapolis]] and [[University of Southern Indiana]] have added their own successes to the legend of Indiana basketball. [[Wabash College]] won the Men's Division III NCAA Championship in 1982 and their 1905 24-0 team was considered World Champions; [[DePauw University]] and [[Manchester College (Indiana)|Manchester College]] were Div III National Finalists. It is safe to say that the terms \"[[Final Four]]\" and \"[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|March Madness]]\" have grown out of the tradition of Hoosier Hysteria.\n\n===Ball State Cardinals===\n{{main|Ball State Cardinals men's basketball}}\nThe [[Ball State Cardinals]] have won several conference championships and earned a number of NCAA Tournament berths over the years, including:\n*Seven [[Mid-American Conference]] Season Championships\n*Seven Mid-American Conference (MAC) Tournament Championships (and subsequent NCAA Tournament appearances)\n*[[Bonzi Wells]], a [[Muncie, Indiana]] native, was a four-year letterwinner at Ball State, finishing his career as the [[Mid-American Conference]]'s all-time leading scorer, and leading the NCAA in steals.\n*Ball State's highest finish in the NCAA Tournament came in [[1990 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1990]], when they defeated [[Gary Payton]]'s [[Oregon State Beavers]] and Coach [[Denny Crum]]'s [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals]] before falling to eventual champion [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|UNLV]] by 2, 69-67.\n\n===Butler Bulldogs===\n{{main|Butler Bulldogs men's basketball}}\n* Home of the legendary [[Hinkle Fieldhouse]], the largest basketball arena in the world from 1928-1950 (including professional arenas).

Further, as a reward for his leadership in North Africa and Italy, Alexander, along with a number of other prominent British Second World War military leaders, was elevated to the [[peerage]] on 1 March 1946 by [[George VI|King George VI]]; he was created Viscount Alexander of [[Tunis]] and [[Mount Errigal|Errigal]] in the [[County Donegal|County of Donegal]].<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=37407| date=28 December 1945|page=1| supp=y}}</ref>\n\nBrooke felt that Alexander needed an able chief of staff \"to think for him\",<ref name=\"G&B35-6\">{{Harvnb| Graham| Bidwell| 1986| pp=35\u20136}}</ref> while Montgomery (Alexander's subordinate in Africa and Italy) claimed to think of Alexander as \"incompetent\" and success was attained in Tunisia only because Montgomery lent Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks]], the commander of [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]], to organise the coup de grace.<ref name=\"G&B35-6\"/> However, [[Harold Macmillan]] was impressed by Alexander's calm and style, conducting dinners in his mess like those at an [[Oxbridge]] high table, discussing architecture and the campaigns of [[Belisarius]], rather than the current war.<ref name=\"G&B35-6\"/> Macmillan thought Alexander's urbane manner and willingness to discuss and compromise were a sensible way to maintain inter-Allied cooperation, but Alexander's reserve was such that some thought him empty of strategic ideas and unable to make decisions.{{#tag:ref|British diplomat [[David Hunt (diplomat)|David Hunt]], who, during the Second World War, served as an intelligence officer in Greece, North Africa and Italy, and who after the war was a member of the British Committee of Historians of the Second World War,<ref>{{Harvnb| Hunt| 1990| p=xxvi}}</ref> wrote in his war memoirs of Alexander's \"brilliant grasp of manoeuvre and deception\" and \"very sound understanding of the realities of military supply and administration\".<ref>{{Harvnb| Hunt| 1990| p=xxv}}</ref> He also noted that Alexander was, by the almost universal judgement of \"men of experience in senior stations\", the \"foremost British commander of the war\". This was, to his personal knowledge, the case with three British prime ministers: [[Clement Attlee]], Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan.{{sfn| Hunt| 1990| pp=xxiv, xxv}} Hunt also quotes Omar Bradley as writing \"He not only showed the shrewd tactical judgement that was to make him the outstanding general's general of the European war but was easily able to comport the nationally-minded and jealous Allied personalities of his command. In each successive Mediterranean campaign he had won the adulation of his American subordinates\".{{sfn| Hunt| 1990| pp=xxv, xxvi}}|group=n}} Graham and Bidwell, however, wrote that Alexander's impenetrable reserve made it hard to judge whether or not he had any military ideas, but that he was \"unable or unwilling\" to assert his will over his army commanders, and that Mark Clark, who often referred to him scornfully as a \"peanut\" and a \"feather duster\", exploited this weakness.<ref name=\"G&B35-6\"/>\n\n==Governor General of Canada==\nWith the cessation of hostilities, Alexander was under serious consideration for appointment to the post of [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], the British Army's most senior position beneath the sovereign. He was invited, though, by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian prime minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] to be his recommendation to the King for the post of [[Governor General of Canada]]. Alexander thus chose to retire from the army and take up the new position, in anticipation of which he was on 26 January 1946 appointed [[Order of St Michael and St George|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George]]<ref name=LGazGCMG>{{London Gazette| issue=37453 |date=1 February 1946 |page=767}}</ref> and created Viscount Alexander of Tunis, of Errigal in the County of Donegal on 1 March.<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=37491 |date=5 March 1946 |page=1241 }}</ref> On 21 March 1946, the commission under the [[royal sign-manual]] and [[Seal (device)#Signet rings|signet]] appointing Alexander was issued.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?image_id_nbr=363348&document_id_nbr=9853&f=g&PHPSESSID=omradmq984eog5u83o6e6d5p06 |title=Canada Gazette, volume 80, number 16|date=20 April 1946| page= 2431|accessdate=19 April 2017}}</ref> Alexander was subsequently sworn-in during a ceremony in the [[Senate of Canada|Senate chamber]] on 12 April that year.<ref>{{Harvnb| Coucill| 1998| p=86}}</ref>\n[[File:Alexander-arrives.jpg|thumb|left|The Viscount and Viscountess Alexander of Tunis are greeted by [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]] upon the viceregal couple's arrival in [[Ottawa]], 12 April 1946]]\n\nAlexander took his duties as the viceroy quite seriously, feeling that, as governor general, he acted as a connection between Canadians and their King, and spent considerable time traveling Canada during his term; he eventually logged no less than 294,500&nbsp; km (184,000&nbsp; mi) during his five years as governor general. On these trips, he sought to engage with Canadians through various ceremonies and events; he was keenly interested in his role as [[Scouts Canada#Organizational Structure|Chief Scout of Canada]] and, in preparation for his kicking of the opening ball in the 1946 [[Grey Cup]] final, practised frequently on the grounds of the royal and viceregal residence, [[Rideau Hall]]. Also, in commemoration of Alexander being named the first non-aboriginal chief of the [[Kwakiutl]] tribe, he was given a [[totem pole]] on 13 July 1946; crafted by [[Mungo Martin]], it remains on the grounds of Rideau Hall today.<ref name=GGAlex/> By the end of the year, Alexander was also distinguished with his induction as a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Order of the Garter]].<ref name=LGazKG>{{London Gazette| issue=37807| date=3 December 1946|page=5945| supp=y}}</ref>\n\nIn 1947, the King issued [[Letters Patent, 1947|letters patent]] granting his Canadian governor general permission to exercise all those powers belonging to the monarch in respect of Canada and, at the [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers Conference]] of 1949, the decision was reached to use the term ''member of the Commonwealth'' instead of ''[[Dominion]]'' to refer to the non-British member states of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. That same year, Alexander oversaw the admission of the [[Dominion of Newfoundland|British crown colony of Newfoundland]] into [[Canadian Confederation]] and toured the new province that summer. Then, during a later visit to [[Alberta]], the Governor General was admitted to the [[Blackfoot]] tribe as Chief Eagle Head. However, though the post-war period saw a boom in prosperity for Canada, the country was again at war by 1950, with Alexander, in his role as acting [[Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces|commander-in-chief]], deploying to the [[Korean War]] soldiers, sailors, and airmen, whom he would visit prior to their departure for north-east Asia.<ref name=GGAlex/>\n[[File:Alexander-NFLD.jpg|thumb|right|In the Governor General's study at [[Rideau Hall]], Alexander (centre) receives for his signature the bill finalising the union of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Canada]], 31 March 1949{{#tag:ref|The other figures present are (left to right) [[Leader of the Government in the Senate (Canada)|Leader of the Government in the Senate]] [[Wishart McLea Robertson]], [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Louis St. Laurent]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker of the House of Commons]] [[Gaspard Fauteux]] and [[Speaker of the Senate of Canada|Speaker of the Senate]] [[James Horace King]].|group=n|name=Capt}}]]\n\nThe Viscount travelled abroad on official trips\u2014in 1947 visiting [[President of the United States|US president]] [[Harry S.

Costello]], in 1948 caused Alexander some embarrassment when Costello chose the occasion to announce that most of [[Ireland]] were leaving the Commonwealth ([[Northern Ireland]] would remain a constituent part of the [[United Kingdom]]). Although the decision had been taken in principle sometime before, the sudden announcement caused a diplomatic storm and Costello, to deflect criticism, claimed that he had been provoked into making the announcement by a series of diplomatic snubs by Lord Alexander. In his memoirs, Costello was to admit that Alexander's behaviour had in fact been perfectly civil and could have had no bearing on a decision which had already been made to declare the [[Republic of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite book| last=McCullagh| first=David| title=Reluctant Taoiseach| publisher=Gill and Macmillan| year=2010| pages=207\u2013212}}</ref>\n\nThe Alexanders' relatively informal lifestyle at [[Rideau Hall]] was demonstrated when, during the Canadian tour of [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] and her husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]], the Viscount and Viscountess hosted a [[square dance]] in the palace's ballroom. Alexander painted (creating a personal studio in the former dairy at Rideau Hall and mounting classes in art at the [[National Gallery of Canada]]<ref name=GGAlex/>), partook in a number of sports (including [[golf]], [[ice hockey]], and [[rugby football|rugby]]), and enjoyed the outdoors, particularly during [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]'s [[maple syrup]] harvest, himself overseeing the process on Rideau Hall's grounds.<ref name=GGAlex/> The Viscount was known to escape from official duties to partake in his most favourite pastime of [[fishing]], once departing from the 1951 royal tour of Princess Elizabeth to take in a day's fishing at Griffin Island, in [[Georgian Bay]], and granting a day off for students in the town of [[Drayton, Ontario]], where his train briefly stopped.<ref name=WA>{{Cite news| last=Thorning| first=Stephen | title=Valuing Our History| newspaper=The Wellington Adviser| url=http://www.wellingtonadvertiser.com/index.cfm?page=colDetail&itmno=245| accessdate=26 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nAmong Canadians, Alexander proved to be a popular viceroy, despite the calls for a Canadian-born governor general that had preceded his appointment.<ref name=Mead46/> Not only did he have a much praised military reputation\u2014he was considered to be the best military strategist since [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the 1st Duke of Wellington]]<ref name=WA/>\u2014but he was also a charismatic figure with an easy ability to communicate with people.<ref name=GGAlex/> Others, however, did not fully approve of Alexander; editor Hugh Templin, from [[Fergus, Ontario]], met with Alexander during Templin's time as a special correspondent with the [[Canadian Press]] during the Second World War, and he said of the encounter: \"Lord Alexander impressed us considerably, if not too favourably.

This stemmed from his development of [[Moseley's law]] in [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectra]].\n\nMoseley's law advanced atomic physics, nuclear physics and quantum physics by providing the first experimental evidence in favour of [[Bohr model|Niels Bohr's theory]], aside from the hydrogen atom spectrum which the Bohr theory was designed to reproduce. That theory refined [[Ernest Rutherford]]'s and [[Antonius van den Broek]]'s model, which proposed that the [[atom]] contains in its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] a number of positive [[nuclear charge]]s that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rutherford|first1=E.|title=The scattering of \u03b1 and \u03b2 particles by matter and the structure of the atom|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1911|volume=21|issue=125|pages=669\u2013688|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015024088547;view=1up;seq=681|series=6th series}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Broek|first1=A. van den|title=Die Radioelemente, das periodische System und die Konstitution der Atome|journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift|date=1913|volume=14|pages=32\u201341|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015021268936;view=1up;seq=68|trans-title=Radio-elements, the periodic system, and the constitution of atoms|language=German}}</ref> This remains the accepted model today.\n\nWhen [[World War I]] broke out in [[Western Europe]], Moseley left his research work at the [[University of Oxford]] behind to volunteer for the [[Royal Engineers]] of the [[British Army]]. Moseley was assigned to the force of [[British Empire]] soldiers that invaded the region of [[Gallipoli]], Turkey, in April 1915, as a [[telecommunications]] officer. Moseley was shot and killed during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] on 10 August 1915, at the age of 27. Experts have speculated that Moseley could have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1916, if he had not been killed.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=35125|first=Ernest|last=Rutherford|title=Moseley, Henry Gwyn Jeffreys}}</ref><ref>Isaac Asimov (1972), ''Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and technology'', New York:  Doubleday, p. 921.  {{ISBN|0-385-17771-2}}.</ref> As a consequence, the British government instituted new policies for eligibility for combat duty.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Biography==\nHenry G.

Moseley discovered a systematic mathematical relationship between the [[wavelength]]s of the X-rays produced and the atomic numbers of the metals that were used as the targets in X-ray tubes. This has become known as [[Moseley's law]].\n\nBefore Moseley's discovery, the atomic numbers (or elemental number) of an [[chemical element|element]] had been thought of as a semi-arbitrary sequential number, based on the sequence of [[atomic mass]]es, but modified somewhat where chemists found this modification to be desirable, such as by the Russian chemist, [[Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev]]. In his invention of the [[Periodic Table of the Elements]], Mendeleev had interchanged the orders of a few pairs of elements in order to put them in more appropriate places in this table of the elements. For example, the metals [[cobalt]] and [[nickel]] had been assigned the atomic numbers 27 and 28, respectively, based on their known chemical and physical properties, even though they have nearly the same atomic masses. In fact, the atomic mass of cobalt is slightly larger than that of nickel, which would have placed them in backwards order if they had been placed in the Periodic Table blindly according to atomic mass. Moseley's experiments in X-ray spectroscopy showed directly from their physics that cobalt and nickel have the different atomic numbers, 27 and 28, and that they are placed in the Periodic Table correctly by Moseley's objective measurements of their atomic numbers. Hence, Moseley's discovery demonstrated that the atomic numbers of elements are not just rather arbitrary numbers based on chemistry and the intuition of chemists, but rather, they have a firm experimental basis from the physics of their X-ray spectra.\n\nIn addition, Moseley showed that there were gaps in the atomic number sequence at numbers 43, 61, 72, and 75. These spaces are now known, respectively, to be the places of the radioactive synthetic elements [[technetium]] and [[promethium]], and also the last two quite rare naturally occurring stable elements [[hafnium]] (discovered 1923) and [[rhenium]] (discovered 1925). Nothing was known about these four elements in Moseley's lifetime, not even their very existence. Based on the intuition of a very experienced [[chemist]], Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted the existence of a missing element in the Periodic Table, which was later found to be filled by technetium, and [[Bohuslav Brauner]] had predicted the existence of another missing element in this Table, which was later found to be filled by promethium. Henry Moseley's experiments confirmed these predictions, by showing exactly what the missing atomic numbers were, 43 and 61. In addition, Moseley predicted the existence of two more undiscovered elements, those with the atomic numbers 72 and 75, and gave very strong evidence that there were no other gaps in the Periodic Table between the elements [[aluminium]] (atomic number 13) and [[gold]] (atomic number 79).\n\nThis latter question about the possibility of more undiscovered (\"missing\")  elements had been a standing problem among the chemists of the world, particularly given the existence of the large family of the [[lanthanide]] series of [[rare earth element]]s. Moseley was able to demonstrate that these lanthanide elements, i.e. [[lanthanum]] through [[lutetium]], must have exactly 15 members \u2013 no more and no less. The number of elements in the lanthanides had been a question that was very far from being settled by the chemists of the early 20th Century. They could not yet produce pure samples of all the rare-earth elements, even in the form of their [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, and in some cases they were unable to distinguish between mixtures of two very similar (adjacent) rare-earth elements from the nearby pure metals in the Periodic Table. For example, there was a so-called \"element\" that was even given the chemical name of \"[[didymium]]\". \"Didymium\" was found some years later to be simply a mixture of two genuine rare-earth elements, and these were given the names [[neodymium]] and [[praseodymium]], meaning \"new twin\" and \"green twin\". Also, the method of separating the rare-earth elements by the method of [[ion exchange]] had not been invented yet in Moseley's time.\n\nMoseley's method in early X-ray spectroscopy was able to sort out the above chemical problems promptly, some of which had occupied chemists for a number of years. Moseley also predicted the existence of element 61, a lanthanide whose existence was previously unsuspected. Quite a few years later, this element 61 was created artificially in [[nuclear reactor]]s and was named [[promethium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en.html|title=American Chemical Society|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Contribution to understanding of the atom===\nBefore Moseley and his law, atomic numbers had been thought of as a semi-arbitrary ordering number, vaguely increasing with atomic weight but not strictly defined by it. Moseley's discovery showed that atomic numbers were not arbitrarily assigned, but rather, they have a definite physical basis. Moseley postulated that each successive element has a nuclear charge exactly one unit greater than its predecessor. Moseley redefined the idea of atomic numbers from its previous status as an ''ad hoc'' numerical tag to help sorting the elements into an exact sequence of ascending atomic numbers that made the Periodic Table exact. (This was later to be the basis of the [[Aufbau principle]] in atomic studies.) As noted by Bohr, [[Moseley's law]] provided a reasonably complete experimental set of data that supported the (new from 1911) conception by [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Antonius van den Broek]] of the atom, with a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged [[electron]]s in which the atomic number is understood to be the exact physical number of positive charges (later discovered and called [[proton]]s) in the central atomic nuclei of the elements. Moseley mentioned the two scientists above in his research paper, but he did not actually mention Bohr, who was rather new on the scene then. Simple modification of Rydberg's and Bohr's formulas were found to give theoretical justification for  Moseley's empirically derived law for determining atomic numbers.\n\n===Use of X-ray spectrometer===\n[[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectrometers]] are the foundation-stones of [[X-ray crystallography]]. The X-ray spectrometers as Moseley knew them worked as follows. A glass-bulb [[Vacuum tube|electron tube]] was used, similar to that held by Moseley in the photo at the top of this article. Inside the evacuated tube, electrons were fired at a metallic substance (i.e. a sample of pure element in Moseley's work), causing the [[ionization]] of [[electron]]s from the inner [[electron shell]]s of the element. The rebound of electrons into these holes in the inner shells next causes the emission of X-ray [[photon]]s that were led out of the tube in a semi-beam, through an opening in the external X-ray shielding. These are next diffracted by a standardized salt crystal, with angular results read out as [[photograph]]ic lines by the exposure of an X-ray film fixed at the outside the vacuum tube at a known distance. Application of [[Bragg's law]] (after some initial guesswork of the mean distances between atoms in the metallic crystal, based on its density) next allowed the wavelength of the emitted -rays to be calculated.\n\nMoseley participated in the design and development of early X-ray spectrometry equipment, learning some techniques from [[William Henry Bragg]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]] at the [[University of Leeds]], and developing others himself. Many of the techniques of [[X-ray spectroscopy]] were inspired by the methods that are used with [[light|visible light]] [[spectroscope]]s and [[spectrogram]]s, by substituting crystals, ionization chambers, and photographic plates for their analogs in light [[spectroscopy]]. In some cases, Moseley found it necessary to modify his equipment to detect particularly soft [lower [[frequency]]] X-rays that could not penetrate either air or paper, by working with his instruments in a [[vacuum chamber]].\n\n==Death and aftermath==\nSometime in the first half of 1914, Moseley resigned from his position at Manchester, with plans to return to Oxford and continue his physics research there. However, [[World War I]] broke out in August 1914, and Moseley turned down this job offer to instead enlist with the Royal Engineers of the [[British Army]]. His family and friends tried to persuade him not to join, but he thought it was his duty.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reynosa|first1=Peter|title=An Ode to Henry Moseley|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-reynosa/an-ode-to-henry-moseley_b_8924690.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=January 7, 2016}}</ref> Moseley served as a technical officer in communications during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], in [[Turkey]], beginning in April 1915, where he was [[killed in action]] on 10 August 1915.

[[Niels Bohr]] said in 1962 that Rutherford's work \"was not taken seriously at all\" and that the \"great change came from Moseley.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/4517_1.html | title = Oral History Transcript \u2014 Niels Bohr | publisher = [[American Institute of Physics]] | accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Millikan]] wrote, \"In a research which is destined to rank as one of the dozen most brilliant in conception, skillful in execution, and illuminating in results in the history of science, a young man twenty-six years old threw open the windows through which we can glimpse the sub-atomic world with a definiteness and certainty never dreamed of before.

Additional credence is given to this idea by noting the recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics in the two preceding years, 1914 and 1915, and in the following year, 1917. In 1914, [[Max von Laue]] of [[Germany]] won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the [[diffraction]] of X-rays by crystals, which was a crucial step towards the invention of [[X-ray spectroscopy]]. Then, in 1915, [[William Henry Bragg]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]], a British father-son pair, shared this Nobel Prize for their discoveries in the reverse problem \u2014 determining the structure of crystals using X-rays (Robert Charles Bragg, William Henry Bragg's other son, had also been killed at Gallipoli, on 2 September 1915<ref>{{cwgc |id=680754 |name=Bragg, Robert Charles}}</ref>). Next, Moseley used the diffraction of X-rays by known crystals in measuring the X-ray spectra of metals. This was the first use of X-ray spectroscopy and also one more step towards the creation of [[X-ray crystallography]]. In addition, Moseley's methods and analyses substantially supported the concept of [[atomic number]], placing it on a firm, physics-based foundation. Moreover, [[Charles Barkla]] of [[Great Britain]] was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1917 for his experimental work in using X-ray spectroscopy in discovering the [[X-ray fluorescence|characteristic X-ray frequencies]] emitted by the various elements, especially the metals.  \"[[Karl Siegbahn|Siegbahn]], who carried on Moseley's work, received one [the 1924 Nobel Prize in Physics].\"<ref>Isaac Asimov, \"Moseley, Henry Gwyn-Jeffreys\", in ''Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology:  The Lives and Achievements of 1510 Great Scientists from Ancient Times to the Present Chronologically Arranged'' (1982), Garden City, NY:  Doubleday, Second Revised Edition.</ref> Moseley's discoveries were thus of the same scope as those of his peers, and in addition, Moseley made the larger step of demonstrating the actual foundation of atomic numbers. Ernest Rutherford commented that Moseley's work, \"Allowed him to complete during two years at the outset of his career a set of researches that would surely have brought him a Nobel prize\".<ref>{{citation|last=Rutherford|first=Ernest|title=Moseley, Henry Gwyn Jeffreys (1887\u20131915)|series=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35125|accessdate=5 Jan 2013}}</ref>\n\nMemorial plaques to Moseley were installed at Manchester and Eton, and a [[Royal Society]] scholarship, established by his will, had as its second recipient the physicist [[P.

The [[METAR]] reporting code for hail {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} or greater is '''GR''', while smaller hailstones and graupel are coded '''GS'''.\n\nHail is possible within most [[thunderstorm]]s as it is produced by [[cumulonimbus]],<ref name=\"gloss\"/> and within {{convert|2|nmi|km}} of the parent storm.  Hail formation requires environments of strong, upward motion of air with the parent thunderstorm (similar to [[tornadoes]]) and lowered heights of the freezing level. In the [[mid-latitude]]s, hail forms near the [[continental climate|interiors of continents]], while in the [[tropics]], it tends to be confined to high [[elevation]]s.\n\nThere are methods available to detect hail-producing thunderstorms using [[weather satellite]]s and [[weather radar]] imagery. Hailstones generally fall at higher speeds as they grow in size, though complicating factors such as melting, friction with air, wind, and interaction with rain and other hailstones can slow their descent through [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Severe weather warnings are issued for hail when the stones reach a damaging size, as it can cause serious damage to human-made structures and, most commonly, farmers' crops.\n\n==Definition==\nAny thunderstorm which produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=Hailstorm|title=Hailstorm|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|accessdate=2009-08-29|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606103908/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=Hailstorm|archivedate=2011-06-06|df=}}</ref>  Hail has a diameter of {{convert|5|mm|in}} or more.<ref name=\"gloss\">{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=hail1|title=Hail|year=2009|accessdate=2009-07-15|author=Glossary of Meteorology|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725142407/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=hail1|archivedate=2010-07-25|df=}}</ref> Hailstones can grow to {{convert|15|cm|in|0}} and weigh more than {{convert|0.5|kg|lb|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/nssl0001.htm|title=Aggregate hailstone|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2007-04-23|accessdate=2009-07-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810182627/http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/nssl0001.htm|archivedate=2009-08-10|df=}}</ref>\n\nUnlike ice pellets, hailstones are layered and can be irregular and clumped together.

As the droplets rise and the temperature goes below freezing, they become [[supercooled]] [[water]] and will freeze on contact with [[condensation nuclei]]. A cross-section through a large hailstone shows an onion-like structure.  This means the hailstone is made of thick and translucent layers, alternating with layers that are thin, white and opaque.  Former theory suggested that hailstones were subjected to multiple descents and ascents, falling into a zone of humidity and refreezing as they were uplifted.  This up and down motion was thought to be responsible for the successive layers of the hailstone.  New research, based on theory as well as field study, has shown this is not necessarily true.\n\nThe storm's [[updraft]], with upwardly directed wind speeds as high as {{convert|110|mph|km/h}},<ref name=\"ncar\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncar.ucar.edu/research/meteorology/storms/hail.php|title=Hail|year=2008|accessdate=2009-07-18|author=National Center for Atmospheric Research|publisher=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527170048/http://www.ncar.ucar.edu/research/meteorology/storms/hail.php|archivedate=2010-05-27|df=}}</ref> blows the forming hailstones up the cloud. As the hailstone ascends it passes into areas of the cloud where the concentration of humidity and supercooled water droplets varies.  The hailstone\u2019s growth rate changes depending on the variation in humidity and supercooled water droplets that it encounters.  The accretion rate of these water droplets is another factor in the hailstone\u2019s growth.  When the hailstone moves into an area with a high concentration of water droplets, it captures the latter and acquires a translucent layer.  Should the hailstone move into an area where mostly water vapour is available, it acquires a layer of opaque white ice.<ref name=Nelson/>\n\nFurthermore, the hailstone\u2019s speed depends on its position in the cloud\u2019s updraft and its mass.  This determines the varying thicknesses of the layers of the hailstone.  The accretion rate of supercooled water droplets onto the hailstone depends on the relative velocities between these water droplets and the hailstone itself. This means that generally the larger hailstones will form some distance from the stronger updraft where they can pass more time growing.<ref name=Nelson/>  As the hailstone grows it releases [[latent heat]], which keeps its exterior in a liquid phase. Because it undergoes 'wet growth', the outer layer is ''sticky'' (i.e. more adhesive), so a single hailstone may grow by collision with other smaller hailstones, forming a larger entity with an irregular shape.<ref name=\"Brimlow\">{{cite journal|title=Modeling Maximum Hail Size in Alberta Thunderstorms|journal=Weather and Forecasting|author1=Julian C.

Hail forming in this manner appears [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] due to small air bubbles that become trapped in the stone during rapid freezing. These bubbles coalesce and escape during the 'wet growth' mode, and the hailstone is more clear. The mode of growth for a hailstone can change throughout its development, and this can result in distinct layers in a hailstone's cross-section.<ref name=rauber>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9_8YLgEACAAJ&dq=severe+%26+hazardous+weather|title=Severe & Hazardous Weather|isbn=9780757597725|author1=Rauber|first1=Robert M|last2=Walsh|first2=John E|last3=Charlevoix|first3=Donna Jean|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nThe hailstone will keep rising in the thunderstorm until its mass can no longer be supported by the updraft.  This may take at least 30 minutes based on the force of the updrafts in the hail-producing thunderstorm, whose top is usually greater than 10&nbsp;km high.  It then falls toward the ground while continuing to grow, based on the same processes, until it leaves the cloud.

However, radar data has to be complemented by a knowledge of current atmospheric conditions which can allow one to determine if the current atmosphere is conducive to hail development.\n\nModern radar scans many angles around the site. Reflectivity values at multiple angles above ground level in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the [[Vertically Integrated Liquid]] or VIL, gives the [[liquid water content]] in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm is related to the evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hgx/projects/hail_study.htm|title=VIL density and Associated Hail Size Along the Northwest Gulf Coast|author1=Charles A.

Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground.\n\nCertain patterns of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The [[three body scatter spike]] is an example. This is the result of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went directly from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.\n\nMore recently, the [[Dual polarization|polarization]] properties of weather radar returns have been analyzed to differentiate between hail and heavy rain.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=K. |last1=Aydin |first2=T.A. |last2=Seliga |first3=V. |last3=Balaji |date=October 1986 |title=Remote Sensing of Hail with a Dual Linear Polarization Radar |journal=Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1475\u201314 |doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1986)025<1475:RSOHWA>2.0.CO;2 |issn=1520-0450|bibcode = 1986JApMe..25.1475A  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chill.colostate.edu/w/Hail_signature_development|title=Hail Signature Development|author=[[Colorado State University]]-CHILL National Radar Facility|publisher=[[Colorado State University]]|date=2007-08-22|accessdate=2009-08-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107012923/http://chill.colostate.edu./w/Hail_signature_development|archivedate=2009-01-07|df=}}</ref> The use of differential reflectivity (<math>Z_{dr}</math>), in combination with horizontal reflectivity (<math>Z_{h}</math>) has led to a variety of hail classification algorithms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chill.colostate.edu/w/Hydrometeor_classification_example|title=Hydrometeor classification example|author=[[Colorado State University]]-CHILL National Radar Facility|publisher=[[Colorado State University]]|date=2008-08-25|accessdate=2009-08-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624185402/http://chill.colostate.edu/w/Hydrometeor_classification_example|archivedate=2010-06-24|df=}}</ref>  Visible satellite imagery is beginning to be used to detect hail, but false alarm rates remain high using this method.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0169-8095(96)00032-4|date=1998-07-25|title=Satellite data based detection and prediction of hail|last1=Bauer-Messmer|first1=Bettina|last2=Waldvogel|first2=Albert|journal=Atmospheric Research|volume=43|issue=3|page=217|bibcode = 1997AtmRe..43..217B }}</ref>\n\n== Size and terminal velocity ==\n[[File:Hailstones.jpg|right|thumb|210px|right|Hailstones ranging in size from few millimetres to over a centimetre in diameter.]] \n[[File:Hagelkorn mit Anlagerungsschichten.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Large hailstone with concentric rings]]\n\nThe size of hailstones is best determined by measuring their diameter with a ruler.

In most variants, [[proper noun]]s, such as names, places, and brands, are not allowed. Slang words, sometimes referred to as informal or shortened words, are also not allowed. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man [[stick figure]] as a [[Tally marks|tally mark]].\n\nThe player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram. On the other hand, if the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over, this time with the guesser losing. However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters or numbers that appears in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Classroom game of hangman.jpg|thumb|left|A classroom game of Hangman]]\nAs the name of the game suggests, the [[diagram]] is designed to look like a [[hanging]] man. Although debates have arisen about the questionable taste of this picture,<ref>[http://www.japanprobe.com/2010/07/23/foreign-english-teacher-under-attack-for-playing-hangman-game/ Foreign English Teacher Under Attack For Playing Hangman Game] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225154041/http://www.japanprobe.com/2010/07/23/foreign-english-teacher-under-attack-for-playing-hangman-game/ |date=2010-12-25 }}, ''Japan Probe'', July 23, 2010</ref> it is still in use today. A common alternative for teachers is to draw an [[apple tree]] with ten apples, erasing or crossing out the [[apple]]s as the guesses are used up.\n\nThe exact nature of the diagram differs; some players draw the [[gallows]] before play and draw parts of the man\u2019s body (traditionally the [[head]], then the [[torso]], then the [[arm]]s and [[leg]]s one by one). Some players begin with no diagram at all, and drawing the individual elements of the gallows as part of the game, effectively giving the guessing players more chances. The amount of detail on the man can also vary, affecting the number of chances. Some players include a [[face]] on the head, either all at once or one feature at a time.\n\nSome modifications to game play ([[house rule]]s) to increase the difficulty level are sometimes implemented, such as limiting guesses on high-frequency [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s. Another alternative is to give the definition of the word; this can be used to facilitate the learning of a [[foreign language]].\n\n==Strategy==\nThe fact that the twelve most commonly occurring letters in the [[English language]] are [[Etaoin shrdlu|e-t-a-o-i-n-s-h-r-d-l-u]] (from most to least), along with other [[Letter frequency|letter-frequency]] lists, are used by the guessing player to increase the odds when it is their turn to guess. On the other hand, the same lists can be used by the puzzle setter to stump their opponent by choosing a word which deliberately avoids common letters (e.g. ''rhythm'' or ''zephyr'') or one that contains rare letters (e.g. ''jazz'').\n\nAnother common strategy is to guess vowels first, as [[English language|English]] only has five vowels ([[a]], [[e]], [[i]], [[o]], and [[u]], while [[y]] may sometimes, but rarely, be used as a vowel) and [[English words without vowels|almost every word has at least one]].\n\nAccording to a 2010 study conducted by Jon McLoone for [[Wolfram Research]], the most difficult words to guess include ''jazz'', ''buzz'', ''hajj'', ''faff'', ''fizz'', ''fuzz'' and variations of these.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nowiknow.com/hangmans-most-difficult-word/|date=August 17, 2010|title=Hangman\u2019s hardest word}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBLm9P-ph6U|publisher=BBC|title=QI}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.wolfram.com/2010/08/13/25-best-hangman-words/|title=Jon McLoone 25 Best Hangman Words|last=McLoone|first=Jon|date=13 August 2010|publisher=[[Wolfram Research]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815092214/http://blog.wolfram.com/2010/08/13/25-best-hangman-words/ |archive-date=15 August 2010|dead-url=no|access-date=14 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Derivations==\nThe game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' is based on Hangman but with the addition of multiple-word puzzles, a [[roulette]]-styled wheel, and cash awards.\n\n[[Brazil]] also had a show in the 1960s and again from 2012\u20132013 called ''Let\u2019s Play Hangman'', hosted by the legendary [[Silvio Santos]]. Brazil would later get its own version of ''Wheel of Fortune'', running from 1980 to 1993, again from 2003 to 2012 (during which the new ''Let\u2019s Play Hangman'' aired), and again since 2013 to the present.  These shows were also hosted by Santos.\n\n==Example game==\nThe following example game illustrates a player trying to guess the word ''hangman'' using a strategy based solely on letter frequency.

Typically, it is appropriate for situations when the average of [[rate (mathematics)|rate]]s is desired.\n\nThe harmonic mean can be expressed as the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the [[arithmetic mean]] of the reciprocals of the given set of observations. As a simple example, the harmonic mean of 1, 4, and 4 is\n: <math>\\left(\\frac{1^{-1} + 4^{-1} + 4^{-1}}{3}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{3}{\\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{3}{1.5} = 2\\,.</math>\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe harmonic mean ''H'' of the positive [[real number]]s\n<math>x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n</math> is defined to be\n\n:<math>H = \\frac{n}{\\frac1{x_1} + \\frac1{x_2} + \\cdots + \\frac1{x_n}} = \\frac{n}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\frac1{x_i}} = \\left(\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n x_i^{-1}}{n}\\right)^{-1}.</math>\n\nThe third formula in the above equation expresses the harmonic mean as the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals.\n\nFrom the following formula:\n\n:<math>H = \\frac{n\\cdot \\prod\\limits_{j=1}^n x_j}{ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\left\\{\\frac{1}{x_i}{\\prod\\limits_{j=1}^n x_j}\\right\\}}.</math>\n\nit is more apparent that the harmonic mean is related to the [[arithmetic mean|arithmetic]] and [[geometric mean]]s. It is the reciprocal [[dual (mathematics)|dual]] of the [[arithmetic mean]] for positive inputs:\n\n:<math>1/H(1/x_1 \\ldots 1/x_n) = A(x_1 \\ldots x_n)</math>\n\nThe harmonic mean is a [[Schur-concave]] function, and dominated by the minimum of its arguments, in the sense that for any positive set of arguments, <math>\\min(x_1 \\ldots x_n) \\le H(x_1 \\ldots x_n) \\le n \\min(x_1 \\ldots x_n)</math>. Thus, the harmonic mean cannot be made [[arbitrarily large]] by changing some values to bigger ones (while having at least one value unchanged).\n\n==Relationship with other means==\nThe harmonic mean is one of the three [[Pythagorean means]]. For all ''positive'' data sets ''containing at least one pair of nonequal values'', the harmonic mean is always the least of the three means,<ref>Da-Feng Xia, Sen-Lin Xu, and Feng Qi, \"A proof of the arithmetic mean-geometric mean-harmonic mean inequalities\", RGMIA Research Report Collection, vol. 2, no. 1, 1999, http://ajmaa.org/RGMIA/papers/v2n1/v2n1-10.pdf</ref> while the [[arithmetic mean]] is always the greatest of the three and the [[geometric mean]] is always in between. (If all values in a nonempty dataset are equal, the three means are always equal to one another; e.g., the harmonic, geometric, and arithmetic means of {2,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2} are all&nbsp;2.)\n\nIt is the special case ''M''<sub>\u22121</sub> of the [[power mean]]:\n\n:<math>H\\left(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\right) = M_{-1}\\left(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\right) = \\frac{n}{x_1^{-1} + x_2^{-1} + \\cdots + x_n^{-1}}</math>\n\nSince the harmonic mean of a list of numbers tends strongly toward the least elements of the list, it tends (compared to the arithmetic mean) to mitigate the impact of large outliers and aggravate the impact of small ones.\n\nThe arithmetic mean is often mistakenly used in places calling for the harmonic mean.<ref>*''Statistical Analysis'', Ya-lun Chou, Holt International, 1969, {{ISBN|0030730953}}</ref> In the speed example [[#Examples|below]] for instance, the arithmetic mean of 50 is incorrect, and too big.\n\nThe harmonic mean is related to the other Pythagorean means, as seen in the equation below. This can be seen by interpreting the denominator to be the arithmetic mean of the product of numbers ''n'' times but each time omitting the ''j''-th term. That is, for the first term, we multiply all ''n'' numbers except the first; for the second, we multiply all ''n'' numbers except the second; and so on. The numerator, excluding the ''n'', which goes with the arithmetic mean, is the geometric mean to the power&nbsp;''n''. Thus the ''n''-th harmonic mean is related to the ''n''-th geometric and arithmetic means. The general formula is\n\n:<math>H\\left(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\right) =\n  \\frac{\\left(G\\left(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\right)\\right)^n}\n       {A\\left(x_2 x_3 \\cdots x_n, x_1 x_3 \\cdots x_n, \\ldots, x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_{n-1}\\right)} =\n  \\frac{\\left(G\\left(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\right)\\right)^n}\n       {A\\left(\n         \\frac{1}{x_1} {\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n x_i},\n         \\frac{1}{x_2} {\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n x_i},\n         \\ldots,\n         \\frac{1}{x_n} {\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n x_i}\n       \\right)}.\n</math>\n\nIf a set of non-identical numbers is subjected to a [[mean-preserving spread]] \u2014 that is, two or more elements of the set are \"spread apart\" from each other while leaving the arithmetic mean unchanged \u2014 then the harmonic mean always decreases.<ref>Mitchell, Douglas W., \"More on spreads and non-arithmetic means,\" ''[[The Mathematical Gazette]]'' 88, March 2004, 142\u2013144.</ref>\n\n==Harmonic mean of two or three numbers==\n\n===Two numbers===\n[[File:MathematicalMeans.svg|thumb|right|A geometric construction of the three [[Pythagorean means]] of two numbers, ''a'' and ''b''.

For instance, if a vehicle travels a certain distance ''d'' outbound at a speed ''x'' (e.g. 60 km/h) and returns the same distance at a speed ''y'' (e.g. 20 km/h), then its average speed is the harmonic mean of ''x'' and ''y'' (30 km/h) &ndash; not the arithmetic mean (40 km/h). The total travel time is the same as if it had traveled the whole distance at that average speed. This can be proven as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://learningpundits.com/module-view/48-averages/1-tips-on-averages/|title=Average: How to calculate Average, Formula, Weighted average|author=|date=|website=learningpundits.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229231610/https://learningpundits.com/module-view/48-averages/1-tips-on-averages/|archivedate=29 December 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\nAverage speed for the entire journey\n:= <big>{{sfrac|Total distance traveled|Total time taken}}</big>\n:= <big>{{sfrac|2''d''|{{sfrac|''d''|''x''}} + {{sfrac|''d''|''y''}} }}</big>\n:= <big>{{sfrac|2''d''|{{sfrac|''yd'' + ''xd''|''xy''}} }}</big>\n:= <big>{{sfrac|2''dxy''|''d''(''x'' + ''y'')}}</big>\n:= <big>{{sfrac|2''xy''|''x'' + ''y''}}</big> (harmonic mean of ''x'' and ''y'')\n\nHowever, if the vehicle travels for a certain amount of ''time'' at a speed ''x'' and then the same amount of time at a speed ''y'', then its average speed is the [[arithmetic mean]] of ''x'' and ''y'', which in the above example is 40 km/h. The same principle applies to more than two segments: given a series of sub-trips at different speeds, if each sub-trip covers the same ''distance'', then the average speed is the ''harmonic'' mean of all the sub-trip speeds; and if each sub-trip takes the same amount of ''time'', then the average speed is the ''arithmetic'' mean of all the sub-trip speeds. (If neither is the case, then a [[#Weighted harmonic mean|weighted harmonic mean]] or [[weighted arithmetic mean]] is needed. For the arithmetic mean, the speed of each portion of the trip is weighted by the duration of that portion, while for the harmonic mean, the corresponding weight is the distance.  In both cases, the resulting formula reduces to dividing the total distance by the total time.)\n\nHowever one may avoid the use of the harmonic mean for the case of \"weighting by distance\". Pose the problem as finding \"slowness\" of the trip where \"slowness\" (in hours per kilometre) is the inverse of speed. When trip slowness is found, invert it so as to find the \"true\" average trip speed. For each trip segment i, the slowness s<sub>i</sub> = 1/speed<sub>i</sub>. Then take the weighted [[arithmetic mean]] of the s<sub>i</sub>'s weighted by their respective distances (optionally with the weights normalized so they sum to 1 by dividing them by trip length). This gives the true average slowness (in time per kilometre). It turns out that this procedure, which can be done with no knowledge of the harmonic mean, amounts to the same mathematical operations as one would use in solving this problem by using the harmonic mean. Thus it illustrates why the harmonic mean works in this case.\n\n====Density====\nSimilarly, if one wishes to estimate the density of an [[alloy]] given the densities of its constituent elements and their mass fractions (or, equivalently, percentages by mass), then the predicted density of the alloy (exclusive of typically minor volume changes due to atom packing effects) is the weighted harmonic mean of the individual densities, weighted by mass, rather than the weighted arithmetic mean as one might at first expect. To use the weighted arithmetic mean, the densities would have to be weighted by volume. Applying [[dimensional analysis]] to the problem while labelling the mass units by element and making sure that only like element-masses cancel, makes this clear.\n\n====Electricity====\nIf one connects two electrical [[resistor]]s in parallel, one having resistance ''x'' (e.g., 60 [[Ohm|\u03a9]]) and one having resistance ''y'' (e.g., 40 \u03a9), then the effect is the same as if one had used two resistors with the same resistance, both equal to the harmonic mean of ''x'' and ''y'' (48 \u03a9): the equivalent resistance, in either case, is 24 \u03a9 (one-half of the harmonic mean). This same principle applies to [[capacitor]]s in series or to [[inductor]]s in parallel.\n\nHowever, if one connects the resistors in series, then the average resistance is the arithmetic mean of ''x'' and ''y'' (with total resistance equal to the sum of x and y). As with the previous example, the same principle applies when more than two resistors are connected, provided that all are in parallel or all are in series.\n\nThe \"conductivity effective mass\" of a semiconductor is also defined as the harmonic mean of the effective masses along the three crystallographic directions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bart/book/effmass.htm|title=Effective mass in semiconductors|author=|date=|website=ecee.colorado.edu|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020040802/http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bart/book/effmass.htm|archivedate=20 October 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\n===In finance===\nThe weighted harmonic mean is the preferable method for averaging multiples, such as the [[price\u2013earnings ratio]] (P/E), in which price is in the numerator.

That is the appropriate average for the two types of pump is the harmonic mean, and with one pair of pumps (two pumps), it takes half this harmonic mean time, while with two pairs of pumps (four pumps) it would take a quarter of this harmonic mean time.\n\nIn [[hydrology]], the harmonic mean is similarly used to average [[hydraulic conductivity]] values for a flow that is perpendicular to layers (e.g., geologic or soil) - flow parallel to layers uses the arithmetic mean. This apparent difference in averaging is explained by the fact that hydrology uses conductivity, which is the inverse of resistivity.\n\nIn [[sabermetrics]], a player's [[Power\u2013speed number]] is the harmonic mean of their [[home run]] and [[stolen base]] totals.\n\nIn [[population genetics]], the harmonic mean is used when calculating the effects of fluctuations in generation size on the effective breeding population. This is to take into account the fact that a very small generation is effectively like a [[wikt: bottleneck|bottleneck]] and means that a very small number of individuals are contributing disproportionately to the [[gene pool]], which can result in higher levels of [[inbreeding]].\n\nWhen considering [[fuel economy in automobiles]] two measures are commonly used \u2013 miles per gallon (mpg), and litres per 100&nbsp;km. As the dimensions of these quantities are the inverse of each other (one is distance per volume, the other volume per distance) when taking the mean value of the fuel economy of a range of cars one measure will produce the harmonic mean of the other \u2013 i.e., converting the mean value of fuel economy expressed in litres per 100&nbsp;km to miles per gallon will produce the harmonic mean of the fuel economy expressed in miles-per-gallon.\n\nIn [[chemistry]] and [[nuclear physics]] the average mass per particle of a mixture consisting of different species (e.g., molecules or isotopes) is given by the harmonic mean of the individual species' masses weighted by their respective mass fraction.\n\n==Beta distribution==\n[[File:Harmonic mean for Beta distribution for alpha and beta ranging from 0 to 5 - J.

Like most salamanders, it has short legs with four toes on the front legs and five on its back limbs, and its tail is keeled for propulsion. The hellbender has working lungs, but gill slits are often retained, although only immature specimens have true gills; the hellbender absorbs oxygen from the water through capillaries of its side frills.<ref name=fws1/> It is blotchy brown or red-brown in color, with a paler underbelly.\n\nBoth males and females grow to an adult length of {{convert|24|to|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} from snout to [[cloaca|vent]], with a total length of {{convert|30|to|74|cm|in|abbr=on}}, making them the third-largest aquatic salamander species in the world (after the [[Chinese giant salamander]] and the [[Japanese giant salamander]]) and the largest amphibian in North America.<ref name=amphibiaweb1/> An adult weighs {{convert|1.5|to|2.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, making them the fourth heaviest living amphibian in the world after their Chinese and Japanese cousins and the [[goliath frog]], while the largest [[cane toad]]s may also weigh as much as a hellbender. Hellbenders reach sexual maturity at about five years of age, and may live 30 years in captivity.<ref name=fws1>Mayasich, J.; Grandmaison, D.; Phillips, C.

They found three equally divergent genetic units within the genus: ''C. a. alleganiensis'', and two distinct eastern and western populations of ''C. a.  bishopi''. These three groups were shown to be isolated, and are considered to most likely be \"diverging on different evolutionary paths\".<ref name=cryptobranchus2/>\n\n==Distribution==\nHellbenders are present in a number of Eastern US states, from southern [[New York (state)|New York]] to northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]],<ref name=cryptobranchus291>{{cite journal|last=Peterson|first=C.L |author2=Metter, D.E.|author3=Miller, B.T.|author4=Wilkinson, R.F.|author5=Topping, M.S.|title=Demography of the Hellbender ''Cryptobranchus alleganiensis'' in the Ozarks|journal=American Midland Naturalist|date=April 1988|volume=199|issue=2|pages=291\u2013303|jstor=2425812|doi=10.2307/2425812}}</ref> including parts of [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[West Virginia]], [[Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Arkansas]], [[Missouri]], and even a small bit of [[Oklahoma]] and [[Kansas]]. The subspecies (or species, depending on the source) ''C. a. bishopi'' is confined to the [[Ozarks]] of northern Arkansas and southern Missouri, while ''C. a. alleganiensis'' is found in the rest of these states.<ref name=hellbender94/>\n\nSome hellbender populations\u2014namely a few in Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee\u2014have historically been noted to be quite abundant, but several man-made maladies have converged on the species such that it has seen a serious population decline throughout its range. Hellbender populations were listed in 1981 as already extinct or endangered in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Maryland, decreasing in Arkansas and Kentucky, and generally threatened as a species throughout their range by various human activities and developments.<ref name=hellbender94/>\n\n==Ecology==\nThe hellbender salamander, considered a \"habitat specialist\", has adapted to fill a specific niche within a very specific environment, and is labeled as such \"because its success is dependent on a constancy of dissolved oxygen, temperature and flow found in swift water areas\", which in turn limits it to a narrow spectrum of stream/river choices.<ref name=cryptobranchus291/> As a result of this specialization, hellbenders are generally found in areas with large, irregularly shaped, and intermittent rocks and swiftly moving water, while they tend to avoid wider, slow-moving waters with muddy banks and/or slab rock bottoms. This specialization likely contributed to the decline in their populations, as collectors could easily identify their specific habitats.<ref name=cryptobranchus291/> One collector noted, at one time, \"one could find a specimen under almost every suitable rock\", but after years of collecting, the population had declined significantly.<ref name=pennsylvania362>{{cite journal |last=Swanson |first=P.L. |title=Notes on the Amphibians of Venango County, Pennsylvania |journal=American Midland Naturalist |date=September 1948 |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=362\u2013371 |doi=10.2307/2421606|jstor=2421606 }}</ref> The same collector noted, he \"never found two specimens under the same rock\", corroborating the account given by other researchers that hellbenders are generally solitary; they are thought to gather only during the mating season.<ref name=pennsylvania362/><ref name=cryptobranchus604>{{cite journal |last=Humphries |first=W.J. |last2=Pauley |first2=T.K. |title=Seasonal Changes in Nocturnal Activity of the Hellbender, ''Cryptobranchus alleganiensis'', in West Virginia |journal=Journal of Herpetology |date=December 2000 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=604\u2013607 |jstor=1565279 |doi=10.2307/1565279}}</ref>\n\nBoth subspecies, ''C. a. alleganiensis'' and ''C. a. bishopi'' undergo a [[metamorphosis]] after around a year and a half of life.<ref name=cryptobranchus291/> At this point, when they are roughly 13.5&nbsp;cm long, they lose the gills present during their larval stage. Until then, they are easily confused with mudpuppies, and can be differentiated often only through toe number.<ref name=fws1/> After this metamorphosis, hellbenders must be able to absorb oxygen through the folds in their skin, which is largely behind the need for fast-moving, oxygenated water. If a hellbender ends up in an area of slow-moving water, not enough of it will pass over its skin in a given time, making it difficult to garner enough oxygen to support necessary respiratory functions. A below-favorable oxygen content can make life equally difficult.<ref name=pennsylvania362/>\n\nHellbenders are preyed upon by diverse predators, including various fish and reptiles (including both snakes and turtles). [[Cannibalism (zoology)|Cannibalism]] of eggs is also considered a common occurrence.<ref name=amphibiaweb1/>\n\n==Life history and behavior==\n===Behavior===\nOnce a hellbender finds a favorable location, it generally does not stray too far from it\u2014except occasionally for breeding and hunting\u2014and will protect it from other hellbenders both in and out of the breeding season.<ref name=\"cryptobranchus604\"/> While the range of two hellbenders may overlap, they are noted as rarely being present in the overlapping area when the other salamander is in the area. The species is at least somewhat nocturnal, with peak activity being reported by one source as occurring around \"two hours after dark\" and again at dawn (although the dawn peak was recorded in the lab and could be misleading as a result).<ref name=\"cryptobranchus604\"/><ref name=fws1/> Nocturnal activity has been found to be most prevalent in early summer, perhaps coinciding with highest water depths.\n\n===Diet===\n''C. alleganiensis'' feeds primarily on [[crayfish]] and small fish. One report, written by a commercial collector in the 1940s, noted a trend of more crayfish predation in the summer during times of higher prey activity, whereas fish made up a larger part of the winter diet, when crayfish are less active. There seems to be a specific temperature range in which hellbenders feed, as well: between 45 and 80&nbsp;\u00b0F. Cannibalism\u2014mainly on eggs\u2014has been known to occur within hellbender populations. One researcher claimed perhaps density is maintained, and density dependence in turn created, in part by [[intraspecific]] predation.<ref name=\"cryptobranchus604\"/><ref name=cryptobranchus291/><ref name=fws1/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe hellbenders' [[breeding season]] begins in late August or early- to mid-September and can continue as late as the end of November, depending on region. They exhibit no [[sexual dimorphism]], except during the fall mating season, when males have a bulging ring around their [[cloaca]]l glands. Unlike most salamanders, the hellbender performs [[external fertilization]]. Before mating, each male excavates a brood site, a saucer-shaped depression under a rock or log, with its entrance positioned out of the direct current, usually pointing downstream. The male remains in the brood site awaiting a female. When a female approaches, the male guides or drives her into his burrow and prevents her from leaving until she [[Oviposition|oviposits]].<ref name=fws1/>\n\nFemale hellbenders lay 150\u2013200 eggs over a two- to three-day period; the eggs are 18\u201320&nbsp;mm in diameter, connected by five to 10 cords. As the female lays eggs, the male positions himself alongside or slightly above them, spraying the eggs with sperm while swaying his tail and moving his hind limbs, which disperses the sperm uniformly. The male often tempts other females to lay eggs in his nest, and as many as 1,946<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|author=Chris Mattison|year=2005|page=23|publisher=The Brown Reference Group}}</ref> eggs have been counted in a single nest. [[Cannibalism]], however, leads to a much lower number of eggs in hellbender nests than would be predicted by egg counts.<ref name=fws1/>\n\nAfter oviposition, the male drives the female away from the nest and guards the eggs. Incubating males rock back and forth and undulate their lateral skin folds, which circulates the water, increasing oxygen supply to both eggs and adult. Incubation lasts from 45 to 75 days, depending on region.<ref name=fws1/>\n\nHatchling hellbenders are 25\u201333&nbsp;mm long, have a [[yolk sac]] as a source of energy for the first few months of life, and lack functional limbs.<ref name=fws1/>\n\n==Adaptations==\nHellbenders are superbly adapted to the shallow, fast-flowing, rocky streams in which they live. Their flattened shape offers little resistance to the flowing water, allowing them to work their way upstream and also to crawl into narrow spaces under rocks. Although their eyesight is relatively poor, they have light-sensitive cells all over their bodies. Those on their tails are especially finely tuned and may help them position safely under rocks without their tails poking out to give themselves away. They have a good sense of smell and move upstream in search of food such as dead fish, following the trail of scent molecules. Smell is possibly their most important sense when hunting. They also have a [[lateral line]] similar to those of fish, with which they can detect vibrations in the water.<ref name=Mattison2>{{cite book|last=Mattison|first=Chris|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|year=2005|publisher=Grange Books|location=Rochester, Kent|isbn=1-84013-794-0|page=22|chapter=What is an amphibian?}}</ref>\n[[File:Hellbender Salamander.JPG|thumb|Hellbender on display at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park, Washington, DC]]\n\n==Conservation status==\nResearch throughout the range of the hellbender has shown a dramatic decline in populations in the majority of locations. Many different [[wikt:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] sources have helped to create this decline, including the [[siltation]] and sedimentation, blocking of dispersal/migration routes, and destruction of riverine habitats created by dams and other development, as well as pollution, disease and overharvesting for commercial and scientific purposes.<ref name=hellbender94/><ref name=phylogeography1235/> As many of these detrimental effects have irreversibly damaged hellbender populations, it is important to conserve the remaining populations through protecting habitats and\u2014perhaps in places where the species was once endemic and has been extirpated\u2014by augmenting numbers through [[reintroduction]].<ref name=hellbender94/>\n\nDue to sharp decreases seen in the Ozark subspecies, researchers have been trying to differentiate ''C. a. alleganiensis'' and ''C. a. bishopi'' into two management units. Indeed, researchers found significant genetic divergence between the two groups, as well as between them and another isolated population of ''C. a. alleganiensis''. This could be reason enough to ensure work is done on both subspecies, as preserving extant [[genetic diversity]] is of crucial ecological importance.<ref name=hellbender94/>\n\nThe Ozark hellbender has been listed as an endangered species under the [[Endangered Species Act]] by the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] since October 5, 2011. This hellbender subspecies inhabits the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] and Spring River systems in southern Missouri and northern Arkansas, and its population has declined an estimated 75% since the 1980s, with only about 590 individuals remaining in the wild. Degraded water quality, habitat loss resulting from impoundments, ore and gravel mining, sedimentation, and collection for the [[pet trade]] are thought to be the main factors resulting in the amphibian's decline.<ref>{{cite press release |title=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Lists the Ozark Hellbender as Endangered and Moves to Include Hellbenders in Appendix III of CITES |publisher=U.

His father was a lawyer, journalist, author and orator and served as the assistant attorney general of Nebraska from 1911 to 1915. Edgerton grew up in [[Aurora, Nebraska]].  He also spent some of his childhood years in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Lincoln, Nebraska]].\n\n===Education===\nIn 1925 Edgerton received a bachelor's degree in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] where he became a member of [[Acacia Fraternity]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Acacia Fraternity: Notable Acacians|author=Acacia Fraternity|url=http://www.acacia.org/about_notables.php|accessdate=2008-10-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204223942/http://www.acacia.org/about_notables.php|archivedate=2012-02-04|df=}}</ref> He earned an [[Master of Science|S.M.]] in electrical engineering from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1927.  Edgerton used stroboscopes to study synchronous motors for his [[Doctor of Science|Sc.D.]] thesis in electrical engineering at MIT, awarded in 1931. He credited [[Charles Stark Draper]] with inspiring him to photograph everyday objects using electronic flash; the first was a stream of water from a faucet.\n\n===Career===\n[[File:Tumbler Snapper rope tricks moire cancelled.jpg|thumb|alt=Blog of light seemingly mounted on a wire tower|Nuclear explosion captured by Edgerton's Rapatronic camera]]\n[[File:Shockwave.jpg|thumb|[[Shadowgraph]] of bullet in flight using Edgerton's equipment and [[stroboscope]]]]\nIn 1937 Edgerton began a lifelong association with [[photographer]] [[Gjon Mili]], who used stroboscopic equipment, in particular, multiple studio electronic flash units, to produce strikingly beautiful photographs, many of which appeared in [[Life Magazine]]. When taking multiflash photographs this strobe light equipment could flash up to 120 times a second. Edgerton was a pioneer in using short duration electronic flash in photographing fast events [[photography]], subsequently using the technique to capture images of balloons at different stages of their bursting, a bullet during its impact with an apple, or using multiflash to track the motion of a [[devil stick]], for example. He was awarded a bronze medal by the Royal Photographic Society in 1934, the [[Howard N.

Germeshausen to do consulting for industrial clients. Later Herbert Grier joined them. The company name \"Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier\" was changed to [[EG&G]] in 1947. EG&G became a prime contractor for the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and had a major role in photographing and recording nuclear tests for the US through the fifties and sixties. For this role Edgerton and Charles Wykoff and others at EG&G developed and manufactured the [[Rapatronic camera]].\n\nHis work was instrumental in the development of [[side-scan sonar]] technology, used to scan the sea floor for wrecks. Edgerton worked with undersea explorer [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau|Jacques Cousteau]], by first providing him with custom-designed underwater photographic equipment featuring electronic flash, and then by developing sonar techniques used to discover the [[HMHS Britannic|Britannic]]. Edgerton participated in the discovery of the [[American Civil War]] battleship [[USS Monitor]]. While working with Cousteau, he acquired the nickname in photographic circles: \"Papa Flash\". In 1974 Doc Edgerton worked with Paul Kronfield in Greece on a sonar search for the lost city of Helike, believed to be the basis for the legend of Atlantis (www.helike.org).\n\nEdgerton co-founded EG&G, Inc., which manufactured advanced electronic equipment including side-scan sonars, subbottom profiling equipment.   EG&G also invented and manufactured the [[Krytron]], the detonation device for the hydrogen bomb, and an EG&G division supervised many of America's nuclear testing.\n\nIn addition to having the scientific and engineering acumen to perfect [[strobe light]]ing commercially, Edgerton is equally recognized for his visual aesthetic: many of the striking images he created in illuminating phenomena that occurred too fast for the naked eye adorn art museums worldwide. In 1940, his high speed stroboscopic short film ''[[Quicker'n a Wink]]'' won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edgerton-digital-collections.org/docs-life/popular-interest |accessdate=2009-11-28 |title=Popular Interest: 1932\u20131941 \u00ab Harold \"Doc\" Edgerton |date=2009-11-28 |website=edgerton-digital-collections.org}}</ref>\n\nEdgerton was appointed a professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1934.<ref>http://web.mit.edu/museum/exhibitions/edgerton.html</ref> In 1956, Edgerton was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter E|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterE.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref> He was especially loved by MIT students for his willingness to teach and his kindness: \"The trick to education\", he said, \"is to teach people in such a way that they don't realize they're learning until it's too late\". His last undergraduate class, taught during fall semester 1977, was a freshman seminar titled \"Bird and Insect Photography\". One of the [[List of MIT graduate dormitories#Edgerton House|graduate student dormitories]] at MIT carries his name.\n\nIn 1962, Edgerton appeared on ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', where he demonstrated strobe flash photography by shooting a bullet into a playing card and photographing the result.\n\nEdgerton's work was featured in an October 1987 ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' article entitled \"Doc Edgerton: the man who made time stand still\".\n\n===Family===\nAfter graduating from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Edgerton married Esther May Garrett<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/edgerton-0313.html \"Esther Edgerton, widow of 'Doc' Edgerton and benefactor of the Institute, dies at 98\"], ''MIT News'', March 13, 2002</ref> in 1928. She was born in [[Aurora, Nebraska]] on September 8, 1903 and died on March 9, 2002 in [[Charlestown, South Carolina]]. She received a bachelor's degree in mathematics, music and education from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  A skilled pianist and singer, she attended the [[New England Conservatory of Music]] and taught in public schools in Aurora, Nebraska and [[Boston]].  During their marriage they had three children: Mary Louise (4/21/1931), William Eugene (8/9/1933), Robert Frank (5/10/1935). His sister, Mary Ellen Edgerton, was the wife of [[L. Welch Pogue]] (1899\u20132003) a pioneering aviation attorney and Chairman of the old [[Civil Aeronautics Board]]. [[David Pogue]], a technology writer, journalist and commentator, is his great nephew.\n\n===Death===\nEdgerton remained active throughout his later years, and was seen on the MIT campus many times after his official retirement. He died suddenly on January 4, 1990 at the MIT Faculty Club at the age of 86, and is buried in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite news |first= Andy|last= Grundberg|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= H.

It was designated as a \"teaching museum,\" that would preserve Doc's work and artifacts, as well as feature the \"Explorit Zone\" where people of all ages could participate in hands-on exhibits and interact with live science demonstrations. After five years of private and community-wide fund-raising, as well as individual investments by Doc's surviving family members, the '''Edgerton Explorit Center''' was officially dedicated on September 9, 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edgerton.org/about/dr_edgerton.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827040712/http://www.edgerton.org/about/dr_edgerton.htm |archivedate=2012-08-27 |df= }} Edgerton Explorit Center</ref>\n\nAt MIT, the '''Edgerton Center''', founded in 1992, is a hands-on laboratory resource for undergraduate and graduate students, and also conducts educational outreach programs for high school students and teachers.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/edgerton/ Edgerton Center], MIT</ref>\n\n==Works==\n*''Flash!

Among other things such as making the first [[phosphaalkenes]] (compounds with carbon phosphorus double bonds), his doctoral studies included unpublished research on [[carbon suboxide]], O=C=C=C=O, and this led to a general interest in [[molecule]]s containing chains of carbon atoms with numerous multiple bonds. He started his work with an interest in [[organic chemistry]], but when he learned about [[spectroscopy]] it inclined him towards [[quantum chemistry]]; he later developed an interest in [[astrochemistry]].<ref name=\"Nobel Autobiography\" />\n\nAfter obtaining his PhD, Kroto spent two-years in a postdoctoral position at the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in Ottawa, Canada carrying out further work in molecular spectroscopy, and also spent the subsequent year at [[Bell Laboratories]] in New Jersey (1966\u20131967) carrying out Raman studies of liquid phase interactions and worked on quantum chemistry.<ref name=\"Nobel Autobiography\" />\n\n===Research at the University of Sussex===\nIn 1967, Kroto began teaching and research at the [[University of Sussex]] in England.  During his time at Sussex from 1967 to 1985, he carried out research mainly focused on the spectroscopic studies of new and novel unstable and semi-stable species.  This work resulted in the birth of the various fields of new chemistry involving carbon multiply bonded to second and third row elements e.g. S, Se and P. A particularly important breakthrough (with Sussex colleague John Nixon) was the creation of several new phosphorus species detected by microwave spectroscopy.  This work resulted in the birth of the field(s) of phosphaalkene and phosphaalkyne chemistry.  These species contain carbon double and triple bonded to phosphorus (C=P and C\u2261P).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The detection of unstable molecules by microwave spectroscopy: phospha-alkenes|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications|year=1976|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1976/c3/c39760000513#!divAbstract | doi = 10.1039/C39760000513|page=513|issue=13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, he became a full professor of Chemistry. This coincided with laboratory microwave measurements with Sussex colleague David Walton on long linear carbon chain molecules, leading to radio astronomy observations with Canadian astronomers revealing the surprising fact that these unusual carbonaceous species existed in relatively large abundances in interstellar space as well as the outer atmospheres of certain stars \u2013 the carbon-rich red giants.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Detection of the Heavy Interstellar Molecule Cyanodiacetylene|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|year=1976|bibcode=1976ApJ...205L.173A |doi=10.1086/182117|volume=205|pages=L173}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Harold Kroto: University of Sussex|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/1523|publisher=University of Sussex|accessdate=2 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309212213/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/1523|archivedate=9 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Discovery of buckminsterfullerene===\n[[File:C60 Image for Cover cropped 3.png|thumb|Buckminsterfullerene, C60]]\nIn 1985, on the basis of the Sussex studies and the stellar discoveries, laboratory experiments (with co-workers [[James R.

It was written in [[Old Norse]] in [[Iceland]] by the poet and historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] (1178/79\u20131241) ca. 1230. The name ''Heimskringla'' was first used in the 17th century, derived from the first two words of one of the manuscripts (''kringla heimsins'', \"the circle of the world\").\n\n''Heimskringla'' is a collection of [[saga]]s about the [[List of Norwegian monarchs|Norwegian kings]], beginning with the saga of the legendary [[Sweden|Swedish]] dynasty of the [[Yngling]]s, followed by accounts of historical Norwegian rulers from [[Harald Fairhair]] of the 9th century up to the death of the pretender [[Eystein Meyla]] in 1177. The exact sources of his work are disputed, but included earlier kings' sagas, such as [[Morkinskinna]], [[Fagrskinna]] and the twelfth century Norwegian synoptic histories and oral traditions, notably many [[skald]]ic poems. Snorri had himself visited [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. For events of the mid-12th century, Snorri explicitly names the now-lost work ''[[Hryggjarstykki]]'' as his source. The composition of the sagas is Snorri's.\n\n==Manuscript history==\nThe earliest parchment copy of the work is referred to as ''Kringla''.

The stories are told with a life and freshness, giving a picture of human life in all its reality. The saga is a prose epic, relevant to the history not only of Scandinavia but the regions included in the wider medieval [[Viking expansion|Scandinavian diaspora]]. The first part of the ''Heimskringla'' is rooted in [[Norse mythology]]; as the collection proceeds, fable and fact intermingle, but the accounts become increasingly historically reliable.\n\nThe first section tells of the mythological prehistory of the Norwegian royal dynasty, tracing [[Odin]], described here as a mortal man, and his followers from the East, from Asaland and [[Asgard]], its chief city, to their settlement in [[Scandinavia]] (more precisely to east-central Sweden, according to Snorri). The subsequent sagas are (with few exceptions) devoted to individual rulers, starting with [[Halfdan the Black]].\n\nA version of [[\u00d3l\u00e1fs saga helga|''\u00d3l\u00e1fs saga helga'']], about the saint [[Olaf II of Norway]], is the main and central part of the collection: Olaf's 15-year-long reign takes up about one third of the entire work.\n\nThereafter, the saga of [[Harald Hardrada]] narrates Harald's expedition to the East, his brilliant exploits in [[Constantinople]], [[Syria]], and [[Sicily]], his skaldic accomplishments, and his battles in [[England]] against [[Harold Godwinson]], the son of [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]], where he fell at the battle [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] in 1066 only a few days before Harold himself fell at the [[Battle of Hastings]]. After presenting a series of other kinds, the saga ends with [[Magnus V of Norway]].\n\n===Contents===<!-- This section is linked from [[History of Stockholm]] -->\n''Heimskringla'' contains the following sagas (see also [[List of Norwegian monarchs]]):\n# [[Ynglinga saga|''Ynglinga saga'']]\n# Saga of [[Halfdan the Black|Halfdanr svarti]] (\"the Black\")\n# Saga of [[Harald I of Norway|Haraldr h\u00e1rfagi]] (\"finehair\") (died ca. 931)\n# Saga of [[Haakon I of Norway|H\u00e1kon g\u00f3\u00f0i]] (\"the Good\") (died 961)\n# Saga of King [[Harald II of Norway|Haraldr gr\u00e1feldr]] (\"Greycloak\") (died 969)\n# [[\u00d3l\u00e1fs saga Tryggvasonar|''Saga of King \u00d3l\u00e1fr Tryggvason'']] (died 1000)\n# [[\u00d3l\u00e1fs saga helga|''Saga of King \u00d3l\u00e1fr Haraldsson'']] (died 1030), excerpt from ''conversion of [[Dale-Gudbrand]]''\n# Saga of [[Magnus the Good|Magn\u00fas g\u00f3\u00f0i]] (\"the Good\") (died 1047)\n# Saga of [[Harald III of Norway|Haraldr har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i]] (\"Hardruler\") (died 1066)\n# Saga of [[Olaf III of Norway|\u00d3l\u00e1fr Haraldsson kyrri]] (\"the Gentle\") (died 1093)\n# Saga of [[Magnus Barefoot|Magn\u00fas berf\u0153ttr]] (\"Barelegs\") (died 1103)\n# Saga of [[Sigurd Jorsalfar|Sigur\u00f0r J\u00f3rsalafari]] (\"Jerusalem-traveller\") (died 1130) and his brothers\n# Saga of [[Magnus IV of Norway|Magn\u00fas blindi]] (\"the Blind\") (dethroned 1135) and of [[Harald Gilli|Haraldr Gilli]] (died 1136)\n# Saga of [[Sigurd Haraldson|Sigur\u00f0r]] (died 1155), [[Eystein Haraldson|Eysteinn]] (died 1157) and [[Inge Haraldson|Ingi]] (died 1161), the sons of Haraldr\n# Saga of [[Hakon II of Norway|H\u00e1kon her\u00f0ibrei\u00f0s]] (\"the Broadshouldered\") (died 1162)\n# Saga of [[Magnus V of Norway|Magn\u00fas Erlingsson]] (died 1184)\n\n==Sources==\n\nSnorri explicitly mentions a few prose sources, now mostly lost in the form that he knew them: ''[[Hryggjarstykki]]'' ('spine pieces') by Eir\u00edkr Oddsson (covering events 1130-61), ''[[Skj\u01ebldunga saga]]'', an unidentified saga about Kn\u00fatr inn gamli, and a text called ''Jarlas\u01ebgurnar'' ('sagas of the jarls', which seems to correspond to the saga now known as ''Orkneyinga saga'').<ref>Snorri Sturluson, ''Heimskringla'', trans. by Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes, 3 vols (London: Viking Society for Northern Research, 2011-15) (second edition 2016-), [http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/Heimskringla%20I%20revised.pdf vol 1 (2nd edn)] (p. xi).</ref>\n\nSnorri may have had access to a wide range of the early Scandinavian historical texts known today as the 'synoptic histories', but made most use of:<ref>Snorri Sturluson, ''Heimskringla'', trans. by Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes, 3 vols (London: Viking Society for Northern Research, 2011-15) (second edition 2016-), [http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/Heimskringla%20I%20revised.pdf vol 1 (2nd edn)] (pp. xii-xiii).</ref>\n* ''[[\u00c1grip af N\u00f3regs konunga s\u01ebgum]]'' (copying its account of Harald Fairhair's wife [[Sn\u00e6fr\u00ed\u00f0r]] almost unchanged).\n* ''[[Morkinskinna]]'' (the main source for the years 1030\u20131177, which he copied almost verbatim except for removing many of the anecdotal ''[[\u00fe\u00e6ttir]]'').\n* Possibly ''[[Fagrskinna]]'', itself based on ''Morkinskinna'', but the much shorter.\n* His own ''[[Separate saga of St \u00d3l\u00e1fr]]'', which he incorporated bodily into ''Heimskringla''. This text was apparently based primarily on a saga of Olaf from about 1220 by Styrmir K\u00e1rason, now mostly lost.\n* [[Oddr Snorrason]]'s ''Life of \u00d3l\u00e1fr Tryggvason'', and possibly a Latin life of the same figure by [[Gunnlaugr Leifsson]].\n\nSnorri also made extensive use of [[skaldic verse]] which he believed to have been composed at the time of the events portrayed and transmitted orally from that time onwards, and clearly made us of other oral accounts, though it is uncertain to what extent.<ref>Snorri Sturluson, ''Heimskringla'', trans. by Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes, 3 vols (London: Viking Society for Northern Research, 2011-15) (second edition 2016-), [http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/Heimskringla%20I%20revised.pdf vol 1 (2nd edn)] (pp. ix-xi).</ref>\n\n==Historical reliability==\n\nThe value of ''Heimskringla'' as a historical source has been estimated in different ways during recent times. The historians of mid-19th century put great trust in the factual truth of Snorri's narrative, as well as other old Norse sagas. In the early 20th century, this trust was largely abandoned with the advent of ''saga criticism'', pioneered by [[Curt Weibull|Curt]] and [[Lauritz Weibull]]. These historians pointed out that Snorri's work had been written several centuries after most of the events it describes. In Norway, the historian [[Edvard Bull, Sr.|Edvard Bull]] famously proclaimed that \"we have to give up all illusions that Snorri's mighty epic bears any deeper resemblance to what actually happened\" in the time it describes.<ref>Edvard Bull, ''Det norske folks liv og historie gjennom tidene bd. 2'' (Oslo, 1931)</ref> A school of historians has come to believe that the motives Snorri and the other saga writers give to their characters owe more to conditions in the 13th century than in earlier times. ''Heimskringla'' has, however, continued to be used as a historical source, though with more caution. It is not common to believe in the detailed accuracy of the historical narrative and historians tend to see little to no historical truth behind the first few sagas, however, they are still seen by many as a valuable source of knowledge about the society and politics of medieval Norway.<ref>e.g. Sverre Bagge, ''Society and Politics in Snorri Sturlusons Heimskringla'' (Berkeley, 1991).</ref> The factual content of the work tends to be deemed more credible where it discusses more recent times, as the distance in time between the events described and the composition of the saga was shorter, allowing traditions to be retained in a largely accurate form, and because in the twelfth century the first contemporary written sources begin to emerge in Norway.\n\n==Influence==\nWhereas prior to ''Heimskringla'' there seems to have been a diversity of efforts to write histories of kings, Snorri's ''Heimskringla'' seems thereafter to have been the basis for Icelandic writing about Scandinavian kings, and was expanded by scribes rather than entirely revised. ''[[Flateyjarb\u00f3k]]'', from the end of the fourteenth century, is the most extreme example of expansion, interweaving Snorri's text with many ''\u00fe\u00e6ttir'' and other whole sagas, prominently ''Orkneyinga saga'', ''F\u00e6reyinga saga'', and ''F\u00f3stbr\u0153\u00f0ra saga''.<ref>Snorri Sturluson, ''Heimskringla'', trans. by Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes, 3 vols (London: Viking Society for Northern Research, 2011-15) (second edition 2016-), [http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/Heimskringla%20I%20revised.pdf vol 1 (2nd edn)] (p. xiii).</ref>\n\nThe text is also referenced in ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' by [[Jules Verne]]; the work is the one Professor Liedenbrock finds Arne Saknussem's note in.\n\n==Editions and translations==\n===History of translations===\nBy the mid-16th century, the Old Norse language was unintelligible to Norwegian, Swedish or Danish readers. At that time several translations of extracts were made in Norway into the Danish language, which was the literary language of Norway at the time.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} The first complete translation was made around 1600 by Peder Clauss\u00f8n Friis, and printed in 1633. This was based on a manuscript known as ''Jofraskinna''.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\nSubsequently, the Stockholm manuscript was translated into Swedish and Latin by [[Johan Peringski\u00f6ld]] (by order of [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]]) and published in 1697 at Stockholm under the title ''Heimskringla'', which is the first known use of the name. This edition also included the first printing of the text in Old Norse. A new Danish translation with the text in Old Norse and a Latin translation came out in 1777\u201383 (by order of [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederick VI]] as crown prince). An English translation by [[Samuel Laing (travel writer)|Samuel Laing]] was finally published in 1844, with a second edition in 1889. Other English translations followed.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\nIn the 19th century, as Norway was achieving independence after centuries of union with Denmark and Sweden, the stories of the independent Norwegian medieval kingdom won great popularity in Norway. Heimskringla, although written by an Icelander, became an important national symbol for Norway during the period of [[romantic nationalism]].{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} In 1900, the Norwegian parliament, the [[Stortinget|Storting]], subsidized the publication of new translations of Heimskringla into both Norwegian written forms, [[nynorsk|landsm\u00e5l]] and [[bokm\u00e5l|riksm\u00e5l]], \"in order that the work may achieve wide distribution at a low price\".<ref>''\"forat verket ved en lav pris kan faa almindelig udbredelse\".''

Norway|county]], Norway.  It is part of the [[Districts of Norway|traditional region]] of [[Hedmarken]].  The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Hamar.  The municipality of Hamar was separated from [[Vang, Hedmark|Vang]] as a town and municipality of its own in 1849. Vang was merged back into Hamar on 1 January 1992.\n\nThe town is located on the shores of [[Mj\u00f8sa]], Norway's largest lake, and is the principal city of Hedmark county. It is bordered to the northwest by the municipality of [[Ringsaker]], to the north by [[\u00c5mot]], to the east by [[L\u00f8ten]], and to the south by [[Stange]].\n\n==General information==\n\n===Name===\nThe municipality (originally the town) is named after the old ''Hamar'' farm ([[Old Norse]]: ''Hamarr''); the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town was built on its ground.  The name is identical with the word ''hamarr'' which means \"rocky hill\".\n\n===Coat-of-arms===\nThe [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] shows a [[Black Grouse]] sitting in the top of a [[pine]] tree on a white background. It was first described in the anonymous [[Hamar Chronicle]], written in 1553.\n\n{| style=\"float: center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Number of minorities (1st and 2nd generation) in Hamar by country of origin in 2017'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/selectvarval/Define.asp?subjectcode=&ProductId=&MainTable=FolkInnvkatLand&nvl=&PLanguage=1&nyTmpVar=true&CMSSubjectArea=befolkning&KortNavnWeb=innvbef&StatVariant=&checked=true |title=Immigrants and Norwegian-born to immigrant parents, by immigration category, country background and percentages of the population |language=English |publisher=ssb.no |accessdate=26 June 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702101705/https://www.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/selectvarval/Define.asp?subjectcode=&ProductId=&MainTable=FolkInnvkatLand&nvl=&PLanguage=1&nyTmpVar=true&CMSSubjectArea=befolkning&KortNavnWeb=innvbef&StatVariant=&checked=true |archivedate=2 July 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n \n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Ancestry\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Number\n|-\n| {{flag|Somalia}}||335\n|-\n| {{flag|Poland}}||312\n|-\n| {{flag|Sweden}}||217\n|-\n| {{flag|Iraq}}||202\n|-\n| {{flag|Iran}}||177\n|-\n| {{flag|Kosovo}}||156\n|-\n| {{flag|Eritrea}}||154\n|-\n| {{flag|Vietnam}}||145\n|-\n| {{flag|Denmark}}||134\n|-\n| {{flag|Afghanistan}}||107\n|-\n| {{flag|Romania}}||105\n|-\n| {{flag|Myanmar}}||97\n|}\n\n==History==\nBetween 500 and 1000 [[Anno Domini|AD]], Aker farm was one of the most important power centres in Norway, located just a few kilometres away from today's Hamar. Three coins found in [[Ringerike (traditional district)|Ringerike]] in 1895 have been dated to the time of [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardr\u00e5de]] and are inscribed ''Olafr a Hamri''.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nAt some point, presumably after 1030 but clearly before 1152, the centre was moved from Aker to the [[List of peninsulas|peninsula]] near Rosenlundvika, what we today know as Domkirkeodden. There are some indications [[Harald Hardr\u00e5de]] initiated this move because he had property at the new site.\n\nMuch of the information about medieval Hamar is derived from the Hamar Chronicles, dated to about 1550. The town is said to have reached its apex in the early 14th century, dominated by the [[Cathedral Ruins in Hamar|Hamar cathedral]], bishop's manor, and fortress, and surrounding urbanization. The town was known for its fragrant apple [[orchard]]s, but there were also merchants, craftsmen, and fishermen in the town.\n\nAfter the [[Christianization]] of Norway in 1030, Hamar began to gain influence as a centre for trade and religion, until the episcopal representative [[Pope Adrian IV|Nikolaus Breakspear]] in 1152 founded [[Ancient Diocese of Hamar|Hamar Kaupangen]] as one of five [[diocese]]s in medieval Norway. This diocese included [[Hedemarken]] and [[Oppland|Christians Amt]], being separated in 1152 from the former [[diocese of Oslo]]. The first [[Ancient Diocese of Hamar|bishop of Hamar]] was Arnold, Bishop of [[Gardar, Greenland]] (1124\u20131152). He began to build the now ruined cathedral of Christ Church, which was completed about the time of Bishop Paul (1232\u20131252). Bishop [[Thorfinn of Hamar|Thorfinn]] (1278\u20131282) was exiled and died at [[List of Christian religious houses in Belgium|Ter Doest abbey]] in Flanders, and was later [[canonised]]. Bishop J\u00f6rund (1285\u20131286) was transferred to [[Trondheim]]. A provincial council was held in 1380. Hamar remained an important religious and political centre in Norway, organized around the cathedral and the bishop's manor until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] 1536-1537, when it lost its status as a bishopric after the last Catholic bishop, [[Mogens Lauritss\u00f8n]] (1513\u20131537), was taken prisoner in his castle at Hamar by [[Truid Ulfstand]], a [[Danish nobility|Danish noble]], and sent to [[Antvorskov]] in Denmark, where he was mildly treated until his death in 1542. There were at Hamar a cathedral chapter with ten canons, a school, a Dominican Priory of St. Olaf, and a [[monastery]] of the [[Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony|Canons Regular of St. Anthony of Vienne]].<ref>{{Catholic|wstitle=Ancient See of Hamar|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nHamar, like most of Norway, was severely diminished by the [[Black Plague]] in 1349, and by all accounts continued this decline until the Reformation, after which it disappeared.\n\nThe Reformation in Norway took less than 10 years to complete, from 1526 to 1536. The fortress was made into the residence of the sheriff and renamed [[Hamarhus]] fortress. The cathedral was still used but fell into disrepair culminating with the [[Sweden|Swedish]] army's siege and attempted demolition in 1567, during the [[Northern Seven Years' War]], when the manor was also devastated.\n\n===Reformation and decline===\nBy 1587, merchants in [[Oslo]] had succeeded in moving all of Hamar's market activities to Oslo. Though some regional and seasonal trade persisted into the 17th century, Hamar as a town ceased to exist by then. In its place, the area was used for agriculture under the farm of Storhamar, though the ruins of the cathedral, fortress, and lesser buildings became landmarks for centuries since then.\n\nThe King made Hamarhus a feudal seat until 1649, when [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] transferred the property known as Hammer to [[Hannibal Sehested (governor)|Hannibal Sehested]], making it private property. In 1716, the estate was sold to Jens Gr\u00f8nbech (1666\u20131734). With this, a series of construction projects started, and the farm became known as Storhamar, passing through several owners until [[Norwegian nobility]] was abolished in 1831, when Erik Anker took over the farm.<ref name=Ramseth>{{Cite book|first=Christian|last=Ramseth|title=Hamar bys historie: til 50 \u00e5rs jubil\u00e6et 21 mars 1899|publisher=Hamar Historical Society|year=1991|language=no}}</ref>\n\n===The founding of modern Hamar===\n[[File:Original city map for Hamar Norway 1848.png|thumb|300px|City plan for Hamar 1848]]\nAs early as 1755, the Danish government in [[Copenhagen]] expressed an interest in establishing a trading center on [[Mj\u00f8sa]]. [[Elverum]] was considered a frontier town with frequent unrest, and there was even talk of encouraging the dissenting [[Hans Nielsen Hauge]] to settle in the area{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Bishop [[Fredrik Julius Bech]], one of the most prominent officials of his time, proposed establishing a town at or near Storhamar, at the foot of Furuberget.\n\nIn 1812, negotiations started in earnest, when the regional governor of [[Oppland|Kristians Amt]], proposed establishing a market on Mj\u00f8sa. A four-person commission was named on 26 July 1814, with the mandate of determining a suitable site for a new town along the shore. On 8 June 1815, the commission recommended establishing such a town at [[Lillehammer]], then also a farm, part of [[F\u00e5berg]].\n\nActing on objections to this recommendation, the department of the interior asked two professors, [[Ludvig Stoud Platou]] and [[Gregers Fougner Lundh]], to survey the area and develop an alternative recommendation. It appears that Lundh in particular put great effort into this assignment, and in 1824 he presented to the [[Storting]] a lengthy report, that included maps and plans for the new town.\n\nLundh's premise was that the national economic interest reigned supreme, so he based his recommendation on the proposed town's ability to quickly achieve self-sustaining growth. He proposed that the name of the new town be called ''Carlshammer'' and proposed it be built along the shore just north of Storhamar and eastward. His plans were detailed, calling for streets 20 meters broad, rectangular blocks with 12 buildings in each, 2 meters separating each of them. He also proposed tax relief for 20 years for the town's first residents, that the state relinquish property taxes in favor of the city, and that the city be given monopoly rights to certain trade. He even proposed that certain types of foreigners be allowed to settle in the town to promote trade, in particular, the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]].\n\nHis recommendation was accepted in principle by the government, but the parliamentary committee equivocated on the location. It left the determination of the actual site to the king so as to not slow down things further. Another commission was named in June 1825, consisting of [[Johan Caspar Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg|Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg]], professor Lundh, and other prominent Norwegians. After surveying the entire lake, it submitted another report that considered eleven different locations, including sites near today's [[Eidsvoll]], [[Minnesund]], [[Tangen]] in [[Stange]], Aker, Storhamar, [[Brumunddal]], [[Nes, Hedmark|Nes]], [[Moelv]]en, [[Lillehammer]], [[Gj\u00f8vik]], and [[Toten]]. Each was presented with pros and cons. The commission itself was split between Lillehammer and Storhamar. The parliament finally decided on Lillehammer, relegating Hamar once more, it seemed, to be a sleepy agricultural area.\n\nAs [[steamboat]]s were introduced on the lake, the urban elite developed an interest in the medieval Hamar, and in 1841, editorials appeared advocating the reestablishment of a town at Storhamar. By then the limitations of Lillehammer's location had also become apparent, in particular those of its shallow [[harbor]]. After a few more years of discussions and negotiations both regionally and nationally, member of parliament [[Frederik Stang]] put on the table once more the possibility of a town in or near Storhamar. The governor at the time, [[Frederik Hartvig Johan Heidmann]], presented a thorough deliberation of possible specific locations, and ended up proposing the current site, at Gammelhusbukten.\n\nOn 26 April 1848, the king signed into law the establishment of Hamar on the grounds of the farms of Storhamar and Holset, along the shores of Mj\u00f8sa. The law stated that the town will be founded on the date its borders are settled, which turned out to be 21 March 1849, known as the merchant town of Hamar, with a trading zone within five kilometers ({{convert|5|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) of its borders.<ref name=Ramseth/>\n\n===Building a city===\n[[File:Hamar lindahl 3.jpg|thumb|300px|View of Hamar in the 1890s]]\nThe area of the new town covered 400 m\u00e5l which is the equivalent to today's {{convert|40|ha|acre}} (40 hectare).  An [[Military engineer|army engineer]], R\u00f8yem, drafted the initial plan. There would be three thoroughfares, at Strandgata, Torggata, and Gr\u00f8nnegate (the latter the name of a medieval road) and a grid system of streets between them. The orientation of the town was toward the shore. R\u00f8yem set aside space for three parks and a public square, and also room for a church just outside the town's borders.\n\nThere were critics of the plan, pointing out that the terrain was hilly and not suitable for the proposed rigid grid. Some adjustments were made, but the plan was largely accepted and is evident in today's Hamar. There were also lingering concerns about the town's vulnerability to [[flood]]ing.\n\nNo sooner had the ink dried on the new law, and building started in the spring of 1849. The first buildings were much like sheds, but there was great enthusiasm, and by the end of 1849, ten buildings were insured in the new town. None of these are standing today; the last two were adjacent buildings on Skappelsgate. By 1850, there were 31 insured houses, and 1852, 42; and in 1853, 56. Building slowed down for a few years and then picked up again in 1858, and by the end of 1860 there were 100 insured houses in the town. The shore side properties were obliged to grow gardens, setting the stage for a leafy urban landscape.\n\nRoads quickly became a challenge \u2013 in some places, it was necessary to [[ford (crossing)|ford]] creeks in the middle of town. The road inspector found himself under considerable stress, and it was not until 1869 street names were settled. Highways in and out of the city also caused considerable debate, especially when it came to financing their construction.\n\nThe first passenger terminal in Hamar was in fact a crag in the lake, from which travelers were rowed into the city. In 1850, another pier was built with a two-storey terminal building. All this was complicated by the significant seasonal variations in water levels. In 1857 a canal was built around a basin that would allow freight ships to access a large warehouse. Although the canal and basin still were not deep enough to accommodate passenger steamships, the area became one of the busiest areas in the town and the point around which the harbor was further developed.<ref name=Pederson/>\n\nThe [[Diocese of Hamar]] was established in 1864, and the [[Hamar Cathedral]] was consecrated in 1866 and remains a central point in the city.\n\nA promenade came into being from the harbor area, past the gardens on the shore, and north toward the site of the old town.\n\n===Establishment of government===\n[[File:Hamar kommunekart.png|thumb|right|150px|Map of Hamar municipality]]\nThe first executive of Hamar was Johannes Bay, who arrived in October 1849 to facilitate an election of a board of supervisors and representatives. The town's [[Royal Charter]] called for the election of 3 supervisors and 9 representatives, and elections were announced in the paper and through town crier. Of the 10 eligible town citizens, three supervisors were elected, and the remaining six were elected by consent to be representatives, resulting in a shortfall of 3 on the board. The first mayor of Hamar was Christian Borchgrevink.\n\nThe first order of business was the allocation of [[liquor license]]s and the upper limit of alcohol that could be sold within the town limits. The board quickly decided to award licenses to both applicants and set the upper limit to 12,000 \"pots\" of liquor, an amount that was for all intents and purposes limitless.\n\nThe electorate increased in 1849 to 26, including merchants and various craftsmen, and the empty representative posts were filled in November. In 1850, the board allowed for unlimited exercise of any craft for which no citizenship had been taken out, which led to much unregulated craftsmanship. Part-time policemen were hired, and the town started setting taxes and a budget by the end of 1849. In 1850, a new election was held for the town board.\n\nThe painter Jakobsen had early on offered his house for public meetings and assembly, and upon buying a set of solid locks, his basement also became the town prison. One merchant was designated as the town's firefighter and was given two buckets with equipment, and later a simple hose, but by 1852 a full-time fire chief was named. There was also some controversy around the watchman who loudly reported the time to all the town's inhabitants every half-hour, every night. Hamar also had a scrupulously enforced ordnance against smoking (pipe) without a lid in public or private.\n\nIn Hamar's early days, the entire population consisted of young entrepreneurs, and little was needed in the way of social services. After a few years, a small number of indigent people needed support, and a poorhouse was erected.<ref name=Pederson/>\n\n===Fires, floods and other disasters===\nIn 1878, as the [[firefighting]] capabilities of the young town were upgraded, a fire broke out in a bakery that was put out without doing too much damage. In February 1879 at 2:00 in the morning another fire broke out after festivities, burning down an entire building that housed many historical items from town's history. This was followed by a series of fires that left entire blocks in ashes that seemed to come to an end in 1881, when a professional fire corps was hired.\n\nIn 1860, concerns about flooding were vindicated when a late and sudden spring caused the lake to flood, peaking on about 24 June, when the street-level floor of the front properties was completely inundated. This was the worst flood recorded since 1789. By 9 July, the floods had receded. But it was not to prove the end of the calamities. In August, massive rainfall led to flash flooding in the area, putting several streets under water. This was immediately followed by unseasonably cold weather, freezing the potato crops and inconveniencing Hamar's residents. And then, mild weather melted all the ice and accumulated snow, leading to another round of flooding. By the time a particularly cold and snow-filled winter set in, there was mostly relief about getting some stability.\n\nIn 1876, the town was scandalized by the apprehension of one Kristoffer Svartb\u00e6kken, arrested for the cold-blooded murder of 19-year-old Even Nilsen D\u00e6hlin. Svartb\u00e6kken was convicted for the murder and executed the year after in the neighboring rural community of [[L\u00f8ten]] in what must have been a spectacle with an audience of 3,000 locals, presumably most of Hamar's population at the time.\n\nThen in 1889, there were riots in Hamar over the arrest of one of their own constables, one sergeant Huse, who had been insubordinate while on a military drill at the cavalry camp at [[Gardermoen]]. In an act of poor judgment, Huse's superior sent him to Hamar's prison in place of military stockades. Partly led and partly tolerated by other constables, the town's population engaged in demonstrations, marches, and other unlawful but non-violent acts that were effectively ended when a company of soldiers arrived from the camp at [[Terningmoen]] near Elverum.<ref name=Pederson>{{Cite book|first=Ragnar|last=Pedersen|title=Den adelige frie sedeg\u00e5rd Storhamar (Fra Kaupang og Bygd)|year=1990|publisher=Hedmarksmuseet og Domkirkeodden|isbn=82-990752-7-0|language=no}}</ref>\n{{Wide image|Hamar.jpg|700px|Panorama of Hamar}}\n\n==Cityscape==\n[[File:Koigen og Mj\u00f8sa.jpg|thumb|The clock tower and Koigen island, Lake Mj\u00f8sa]]\nThe [[Hedmark museum]], located on [[Domkirkeodden]], is an important historical landmark in Hamar, an outdoor museum with remains of the medieval church, in a protective glass housing, the episcopal fortress and a collection of old farm houses. The institution is a combined medieval, ethnological and archaeological museum, and has received architectural prizes for its approach to conservation and exhibition. It also houses a vast photographic archive for the Hedmark region.\n\nAdditionally, Hamar is known for its indoor [[long track speed skating]] and [[bandy]] arena, the ''Olympia Hall'', better known as [[Vikingskipet Olympic Arena|Vikingskipet]] (\"The [[Viking]] ship\") for its shape. It was built to host the speed skating competitions of the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] that were held in nearby [[Lillehammer]]. Already in 1993 it hosted the [[Bandy World Championship]]. The Vikingskipet Olympic Arena was later used in the winter of 2007 as the service park for Rally Norway, the second round of the 2007 [[World Rally Championship]] season. It has been the host for the world's second largest computer party [[The Gathering (computer party)|The Gathering]] starting on the Wednesday in Easter each year, for the last 13 years.\n\nAlso situated in Hamar is the [[Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre]] which hosted the [[figure skating]] and [[short track speed skating]] events of the 1994 Winter Olympics. The figure skating competition was highly anticipated. It featured [[Nancy Kerrigan]] and [[Tonya Harding]], who drew most of the media attention, however the gold medal was won by [[Oksana Baiul]] of [[Ukraine]].\n\nThe centre of Hamar is the pedestrian walkway in the middle of town, with the library, cinema and farmer's market on Stortorget (the big square) on the western side, and \u00d8stre Torg (the eastern square), which sits on top of an underground multi-story carpark, on the eastern side.\n\n== Transport ==\nHamar is an important railway junction between two different lines to [[Trondheim]]. [[R\u00f8rosbanen]], the old railway line, branches off from the mainline [[Dovre Line]]. The [[Norwegian Railway Museum]] (''Norsk Jernbanemuseum'') is also in Hamar.\n[[File:Hamar Railway Station.jpg|thumb|Hamar Railway Station]]\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{Maincat|People from Hamar}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F032086-0003, Kanzleramt, Brandt gibt Sommerfest cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|Rut Brandt in 1970]]\n* [[Anders Baasmo Christiansen]], actor (b. 1976)\n* [[Rut Brandt]], writer, second wife of [[Willy Brandt]] (1920\u20131986)\n* [[Irene Dalby]], former top swimmer (b. 1971)\n* [[Egil Danielsen]], Olympic [[gold medal]]ist, [[Javelin throw|javelin]] (b. 1933)\n* [[Rikka Deinboll]], librarian and translator (1897\u20131973)\n* [[Sigurd Evensmo]], author (1912\u20131978)\n* [[Knut Faldbakken]], writer (b. 1941)\n* [[Kirsten Flagstad]], opera singer (1895\u20131962)\n* [[Hulda Garborg]], writer (1862\u20131934)\n* [[Rolf Jacobsen (poet)|Rolf Jacobsen]], Poet (1907\u20131994)\n* [[Olaf Johannessen (sport shooter)|Olaf Johannessen]], shooter (1890\u20131977)\n* [[\u00d8ivind Bergh]], Norwegian violinist and orchestral leader (1909-1987)\n* [[Erik Kristiansen]], former [[ice hockey]] player (b. 1963)\n* [[Terje Kojedal]], former professional [[Association football|footballer]] (b. 1957)\n* [[Torill Kove]], award-winning [[animator]] (b. 1958)\n* [[Katti Anker M\u00f8ller]], civil rights activist (1868\u20131945)\n* [[Vegard Skogheim]], former professional footballer (b. 1966)\n* [[Patrick Thoresen]], professional ice hockey player (b. 1983)\n* [[Anette Trettebergstuen]], politician (b. 1981)\n* [[Petter Vaagan Moen]], footballer (b. 1984)\n* [[Even Wetten]], former [[speed skating|speed skater]] (b. 1982)\n* [[Ole Edvard Antonsen]],  [[trumpet player]] (b. 1962)\n* [[Thorstein Helstad]], [[footballer]]\n* [[Marcus Pedersen]], [[footballer]]\n* [[Ole B\u00f8rud]], singer, song-writer, and instrumentalist (b. 1976)}}\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:1994 Winter Olympics venue map.svg|thumb|Map of the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] venues]]\n[[File:Vikingskipet, Hamar, Norway.jpg|thumb|[[Vikingskipet]], an Olympic venue  of 1994]]\n\n===Team sports===\nHamar boasts several teams at the Norwegian top level in various sports:\n* [[Hamarkameratene]] (Ham-Kam) is a [[Association football|football]] (soccer) team that plays in the [[Adeccoligaen]] after being relegated from the [[Tippeligaen]] in 2008.\n* [[Storhamar Ishockey]] is an [[ice hockey]] team which is currently playing in the Norwegian [[GET-ligaen]].

The book continues the history of the [[Nephite]]s and the [[Lamanites]] \"according to the records of [[Helaman, son of Helaman|Helaman]], who was the son of [[Helaman]], and also according to the records of his sons, even down to the coming of [[Christ]]\" (''The Book of Helaman'', preface). According to footnotes, the book covers the time period between c. 52 BC and 1 BC.\n\n== Narrative ==\nIn 52 BC the Nephites had trouble over the succession to Pahoran as judge among his sons. He had many sons, but among these, Pahoran Jr., Paanchi and Pacumeni wanted the seat. They stirred up trouble among the people as they campaigned for the position. The people selected Pahoran by acclaim, and Pacumeni assented.\n\nBut Paanchi had the backing of the minority and he sought to instigate a rebellion. Before he could make much headway, he was arrested and tried, convicted of sedition, and sentenced to death. The minority sent a hitman named Kishkumen to kill Pahoran as he sat on the bench. The assassination was done in disguise so no one could accuse Kishkumen.\n\nMen loyal to Pahoran gave chase, but Kiskkumen evaded them, and returned to the minority. They all swore to God never to utter a word that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran. Still, some of the conspirators were found and sentenced to death.  Pacumeni was elevated to Judge in place of Pahoran.\n\nIn 51 BC the Lamanites came against the Nephites with a mighty host led by a large man named Coriantumr, descendant of Zarahemla. He was dispatched by Tubaloth, king of the Lamanites. The political turmoil surrounding the succession of Pahoran caused the city of Zarahemla to drop its guard somewhat. Coriantumr slew the guards at the gates, marched inside with his whole army, slew all who opposed them and took possession of the city. Pacumeni was personally slain by Coriantumr against the walls of Zarahemla.\n\nCoriantumr, fresh from this victory, prepared a second phase of his campaign against the land of Zarahemla at large. His next goal was the city of Bountiful in the north of the land. The Nephites in the countryside were not able to assemble themselves into a large enough force to oppose the Lamanites, so they were picked off in detail.\n\nBut Moronihah had removed the bulk of the Nephite forces to the border regions, forming a hard crust while leaving the heart of the land largely undefended. Coriantumr was misled by the relative ease of his drive. After learning of the fall of Zarahemla, Moroniahah dispatched Lehi with an army to intercept the Lamanites before they came to Bountiful. In the great battle that followed, even Coriantumr was slain.\n\nWhen the Lamanites found themselves surrounded on every side by Nephites, and their leader slain, they surrendered. Moronihah re-occupied Zarahemla, and allowed the captured Lamanite soldiers to depart the land in peace.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Book of Mormon}}\n*[[Aminadab]] in the Book of Helaman\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Citation\n | last=Nyman \n | first=Monte\n | author-link=Monte S.

It is located in [[Bures-sur-Yvette]] just south of [[Paris]]. It is now part of the federal [[University of Paris-Saclay]] as an advanced studies institute.\n\n==History==\nThe IH\u00c9S, was founded in 1958 by businessman and mathematical physicist [[L\u00e9on Motchane]] with the help of [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Jean Dieudonn\u00e9]] as a research centre in France, modeled on the renowned [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, United States.<ref name=\"50th anniversary\">{{cite web |title=On the occasion of receiving the Seki Takakazu Prize |url=http://mathsoc.jp/publication/tushin/1203/IHES12-3.pdf |publisher=[[Mathematical Society of Japan]]}}</ref>\n\t\n{{quotation|[[IH\u00c9S]] explicitly draws inspiration from the model of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (IAS). ... IH\u00c9S adopted its basic characteristics - the intellectual ones - as a high level institute dedicated to basic research - and certain practical ones - such as the tradition of tea being served daily, conducive to exchanges of views. Of equal importance was the relationship between Oppenheimer and L\u00e9on Motchane (1900-1990), the founder and first director of IH\u00c9S. As life member of the scientific committee, advisor to the director, frequent visitor and regular correspondent, Oppenheimer played a major role in the crucial early years at IH\u00c9S. ... Oppenheimer and Motchane ... exchanged long letters and short telegrams on all aspects of life at IH\u00c9S. ... Visits by Oppenheimer were cleverly orchestrated by L\u00e9on Motchane and reported in the press. Oppenheimer\u2019s presence was an event in itself and his coming to lH\u00c9S gave the Institute important official recognition. Oppenheimer was to come to IH\u00c9S three times: from 16 to 19 September 1959, on 17 and 18 October 1961 (in Bures, although the Institute had not moved there yet), and from 14 to 17 May 1963. His last visit, planned for 1965, was cancelled for health reasons.<ref>[http://www.ihes.fr/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?document_id=3810&portlet_id=1026 IHES \u2013 Oppenheimer and IH\u00c9S (1958-1967)]</ref>}}\n\nThe strong personality of [[Alexandre Grothendieck]] and the broad sweep of his revolutionizing theories were a dominating feature of the first ten years at the IH\u00c9S.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Ren\u00e9 Thom]] received an invitation from IH\u00c9S in 1963 and after his appointment remained there until his death in 2002.<ref>{{cite book |last=edited by Lawrence D.

Reykjav\u00edk and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population.\n\nIceland is [[High island|volcanically]] and [[geothermal (geology)|geologically active]]. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and [[lava field]]s, [[mountains]], and [[glacier]]s, and many [[river|glacial rivers]] flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]] and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the [[Arctic Circle]]. Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a [[tundra climate]].\n\nAccording to the ancient manuscript ''[[Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k]]'', the [[settlement of Iceland]] began in 874 AD when the [[Norway|Norwegian]] chieftain [[Ing\u00f3lfr Arnarson]] became the first permanent settler on the island.<ref name = tomasson/> In the following centuries, [[Norwegians]], and to a lesser extent other [[Scandinavia]]ns, emigrated to Iceland, bringing with them [[thrall]]s (i.e., slaves or serfs) of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] origin. The island was governed as an [[Icelandic Commonwealth|independent commonwealth]] under the [[Althing]], one of the world's oldest functioning legislative assemblies. Following a [[Age of Sturlungs|period of civil strife]], Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century. The establishment of the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. Iceland thus followed Norway's integration into that union, coming under Danish rule after Sweden's secession from the union in 1523. Although the Danish kingdom introduced [[Lutheranism]] forcefully in 1550, Iceland remained a distant semi-colonial territory in which Danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence. In the wake of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Iceland's struggle for independence took form and culminated in [[Danish\u2013Icelandic Act of Union|independence in 1918]] and the founding of a [[Founding of the Republic of Iceland|republic in 1944]]. Until the 20th century, Iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture, and was among the poorest countries in Europe. Industrialisation of the fisheries and [[Marshall Plan]] aid following [[World War II]] brought prosperity and Iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world. In 1994, it became a part of the [[European Economic Area]], which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance, biotechnology, and manufacturing.\n\nIceland has a [[market economy]] with relatively low taxes, compared to other [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/60/0,2340,en_2649_34533_1942460_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=OECD Tax Database |website=Oecd.org |accessdate=26 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125144548/http://www.oecd.org/document/60/0%2C2340%2Cen_2649_34533_1942460_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It maintains a [[Nordic model|Nordic social welfare system]] that provides [[universal health care]] and tertiary education for its citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borg.hi.is/ChildWelfare |title=The Icelandic Welfare State and the Conditions of Children |last=\u00d3lafsson |first=Stef\u00e1n |date=12 May 2004 |website=borg.hi.is |accessdate=22 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050818131819/http://www.borg.hi.is/ChildWelfare |archivedate=18 August 2005 }}</ref> Iceland ranks high in economic, political, and social stability and equality.

The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark carry out on its behalf certain defence and foreign affairs matters, subject to consultation with the [[Althing]]. Danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags: those of the Kingdom of Denmark and those of the [[Kingdom of Iceland]]. Iceland's legal position became comparable to those of countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Nations such as Canada whose sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nDuring World War II, Iceland joined Denmark in asserting neutrality. After the [[German occupation of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940, the Althing replaced the King with a regent and declared that the Icelandic government would take control of its own defence and foreign affairs. A month later, British armed forces [[Operation Fork|invaded and occupied the country]], violating Icelandic [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].

The cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the Althing; however, the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how to distribute its seats, under the condition that it has a majority support in the Althing. Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally. This has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 regent [[Sveinn Bj\u00f6rnsson]], who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941, appointed a non-parliamentary government.

The most famous of these include ''[[Nj\u00e1ls saga]]'', about an epic blood feud, and ''[[Gr\u00e6nlendinga saga]]'' and ''[[Saga of Erik the Red|Eir\u00edks saga]]'', describing the discovery and settlement of Greenland and Vinland (modern [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]). ''[[Egils saga]]'', ''[[Laxd\u00e6la saga]]'', ''[[Grettis saga]]'', ''[[G\u00edsla saga]]'' and ''[[Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu]]'' are also notable and popular Icelanders' sagas.\n\nA translation of the Bible was published in the 16th century. Important compositions since the 15th to the 19th century include sacred verse, most famously the [[Passion Hymns]] of [[Hallgr\u00edmur P\u00e9tursson]], and ''[[r\u00edmur]]'', rhyming epic poems. Originating in the 14th century, ''r\u00edmur'' were popular into the 19th century, when the development of new literary forms was provoked by the influential, [[Romantic nationalism|National-Romantic]] writer [[J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson]]. In recent times, Iceland has produced many great writers, the best-known of whom is arguably [[Halld\u00f3r Laxness]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1955 (the only Icelander to win a Nobel Prize thus far). [[Steinn Steinarr]] was an influential modernist poet during the early 20th century who remains popular.\n\nIcelanders are avid consumers of literature, with the highest number of bookstores per capita in the world.

Several other Icelandic men and women artists studied at [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] at that time, including [[\u00c1sgr\u00edmur J\u00f3nsson]], who together with \u00de\u00f3rarinn created a distinctive portrayal of Iceland's landscape in a romantic naturalistic style. Other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of \u00de\u00f3rarinn and \u00c1sgr\u00edmur. These included [[J\u00f3hannes Sveinsson Kjarval|J\u00f3hannes Kjarval]] and [[J\u00fal\u00edana Sveinsd\u00f3ttir]]. Kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic [[volcanic rock]] that dominates the Icelandic environment. [[Einar H\u00e1konarson]] is an expressionistic and figurative painter who by some is considered to have brought the figure back into Icelandic painting. In the 1980s, many Icelandic artists worked with the subject of the new painting in their work.\n\nIn the recent years artistic practice has multiplied, and the Icelandic art scene has become a setting for many large scale projects and exhibitions. The artist run gallery space Kling og Bang, members of which later ran the studio complex and exhibition venue Klink og Bank, has been a significant part of the trend of self-organised spaces, exhibitions and projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://this.is/klingogbang/text.php?lang=en&|title=Kling & Bang Gallery, This.is|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> [[The Living Art Museum]], Reykjav\u00edk Municipal Art Museum, [[Reykjav\u00edk Art Museum]] and the [[National Gallery of Iceland]] are the larger, more established institutions, curating shows and festivals.\n\n<center>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nThorarinn thingvellir.jpg|''[[\u00deingvellir]]'' by [[\u00de\u00f3rarinn B. \u00deorl\u00e1ksson]]\nThorfinn Karlsefni 1918.jpg|Statue of [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]] by Icelandic sculptor [[Einar J\u00f3nsson]] in [[Philadelphia]]\nLaxness portrett einar hakonarson 1984.jpg|The writer [[Halld\u00f3r Laxness]] by [[Einar H\u00e1konarson]], 1984\nGrassodenh\u00e4user.jpg|Traditional [[Icelandic turf house]]s.

Notable Icelandic music acts include medieval music group [[Voces Thules]], alternative and indie rock acts such as [[The Sugarcubes]], [[S\u00f3ley]] and [[Of Monsters and Men]], jazz fusion band [[Mezzoforte (band)|Mezzoforte]], pop singers such as [[Hafd\u00eds Huld]], [[Emil\u00edana Torrini]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]], solo ballad singers like [[Bubbi Morthens]], and [[post-rock]] bands such as [[Amiina]] and [[Sigur R\u00f3s]]. [[Independent music]] is strong in Iceland, with bands such as [[m\u00fam]] and solo artists.\n\nTraditional Icelandic music is strongly religious. Hymns, both religious and secular, are a particularly well-developed form of music, due to the scarcity of musical instruments throughout much of Iceland's history. Hallgr\u00edmur P\u00e9tursson wrote many Protestant hymns in the 17th century. Icelandic music was modernised in the 19th century, when Magn\u00fas Stephensen brought pipe organs, which were followed by [[Pump organ|harmoniums]]. Other vital traditions of Icelandic music are epic alliterative and rhyming ballads called r\u00edmur. R\u00edmur are epic tales, usually [[a cappella]], which can be traced back to [[skald]]ic poetry, using complex metaphors and elaborate rhyme schemes.<ref>Cronshaw, Andrew. (1999) \"Iceland\". In ''World Music: The Rough Guide''.

A modern revitalisation of the tradition began in 1929 with the formation of I\u00f0unn.{{Clarify|reason = What is I\u00f0unn?

[[\u00deorramatur]] is a selection of traditional cuisine consisting of many dishes, and is usually consumed around the month of [[Month#Germanic calendar|\u00deorri]], which begins on the first Friday after 19 January. Traditional dishes also include [[skyr]] (a yoghurt-like cheese), [[h\u00e1karl]] (cured shark), cured ram, singed sheep heads, and [[black pudding]], Flatkaka (flat bread), dried fish and dark rye bread traditionally baked in the ground in geothermal areas.<ref name=\"Icelandic delicacies\">{{cite web|last1=Thorkelsdottir|first1=Nina|title=The ultimate guide to Icelandic delicacies, part one|url=https://www.travelade.com/iceland/stories/the-ultimate-guide-to-icelandic-delicacies-part-one/|website=Travelade|publisher=Nina Thorkelsdottir|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref> [[Puffin]] is considered a local delicacy that is often prepared through broiling.\n\nBreakfast usually consists of pancakes, cereal, fruit, and coffee, while lunch may take the form of a [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord]]. The main meal of the day for most Icelanders is dinner, which usually involves fish or lamb as the main course. Seafood is central to most Icelandic cooking, particularly [[cod]] and [[haddock]] but also [[salmon]], [[herring]], and [[halibut]]. It is often prepared in a wide variety of ways, either smoked, pickled, boiled, or dried. Lamb is by far the most common meat, and it tends to be either smoke-cured (known as ''[[hangikj\u00f6t]]'') or salt-preserved (''saltkj\u00f6t''). Many older dishes make use of every part of the sheep, such as ''[[sl\u00e1tur]]'', which consists of [[offal]] (internal organs and entrails) minced together with blood and served in sheep stomach. Additionally, boiled or mashed potatoes, pickled cabbage, green beans, and rye bread are prevalent side dishes.\n\nCoffee is a popular beverage in Iceland, with the country being third placed by per capita consumption worldwide in 2016,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|title=Coffee: Who grows, drinks and pays the most?|last=Jones|first=Lora|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-GB}}</ref> and is drunk at breakfast, after meals, and with a light snack in mid-afternoon.

It is a type of [[schnapps]] made from distilled potatoes and flavoured with either [[caraway]] seeds or [[angelica]]. Its potency<!-- in combination with the fact that it had a white scull on the black label, as a warning, according to the wp article, but that needs sources --> has earned it the nickname ''svarti dau\u00f0i'' (\"Black Death\"). Modern distilleries on Iceland produce [[vodka]] ([[Reyka]]), [[gin]] (\u00cdsafold), [[moss]] schnapps (Fjallagrasa), and a [[birch]]-flavoured schnapps and [[liqueur]] (Foss Distillery's Birkir and Bj\u00f6rk). Martin Miller blends Icelandic water with its England-distilled gin on the island. Strong beer was [[Prohibition in Iceland|banned until 1989]], so ''bj\u00f3rl\u00edki'', a mixture of legal, low-alcohol [[pilsner]] beer and vodka, became popular.

Italy covers an area of {{convert|301340|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and has a largely [[Temperate climate|temperate seasonal]] and [[Mediterranean climate]]. With around 61 million inhabitants, it is the [[List of European Union member states by population|fourth-most populous EU member state]] and the most populous country in [[southern Europe]].\n\nDue to its central geographic location in Europe and the Mediterranean, Italy has historically been home to a myriad of peoples and cultures. In addition to the various [[List of ancient peoples of Italy|ancient Italian tribes]] and [[Italic peoples]] dispersed throughout the [[Italian Peninsula]] and [[insular Italy]], beginning from the [[Classical antiquity|classical]] era, [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] and [[Magna Graecia|Greeks]] established settlements in the [[Southern Italy|south of Italy]], with [[Etruscans]] and [[Celts]] inhabiting the [[Central Italy|centre]] and the [[Northern Italy|north]] of Italy respectively. The Italic tribe known as the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] formed the [[Roman Kingdom]] in the 8th century BC, which eventually became a [[Roman Republic|republic]] that [[Roman conquest of Italy|conquered]] and [[Romanization (cultural)|assimilated]] its neighbours. In the first century BC, the [[Roman Empire]] emerged as the dominant power in the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and became the leading cultural, political and religious [[Caput Mundi|centre]] of [[Western world|Western civilisation]]. The [[legacy of the Roman Empire]] is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of [[civilian law]], [[republican government]]s, [[History of Christianity|Christianity]] and the [[Latin script]].\n\nDuring the [[Early Middle Ages]], Italy endured [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|sociopolitical collapse]] and [[barbarian invasions]], but by the 11th century, numerous rival [[Italian city-states|city-states]] and [[maritime republics]], mainly in the northern and central regions of Italy, rose to great prosperity through shipping, commerce and banking, laying the groundwork for modern capitalism.<ref>{{cite web|last=S\u00e9e|first=Henri|title=Modern Capitalism Its Origin and Evolution|url=http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf|work=University of Rennes|publisher=Batoche Books|accessdate=29 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007010542/http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf|archivedate=7 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These mostly independent statelets served as Europe's main trading hubs with Asia and the Near East, often enjoying a greater degree of democracy than the larger [[feudalism|feudal]] monarchies that were consolidating throughout Europe; however, part of central Italy was under the control of the [[theocratic]] [[Papal States]], while [[Southern Italy]] remained largely feudal until the 19th century, partially as a result of a succession of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Arab]], [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman]], [[House of Valois-Anjou|Angevin]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Spanish]] conquests of the region.<ref name=natgeo>{{cite book|last1=Jepson|first1=Tim|title=National Geographic Traveler: Italy|date=2012|publisher=National Geographic Books,|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f2jihJ0bq4EC&pg=PA28&q=trade%20routes%20italy%20new%20world|isbn=9781426208614}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]], [[Renaissance science|science]], [[Renaissance exploration|exploration]] and [[Renaissance art|art]].

In the context of the [[revolutions of 1848|1848 liberal revolutions]] that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful [[First Italian War of Independence|war]] was declared on [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]].

In 1860\u20131861, general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily,<ref>Mack Smith, Denis (1997). ''Modern Italy; A Political History''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|0-472-10895-6}}</ref> while the House of Savoy troops occupied the central territories of the Italian peninsula, except Rome and part of Papal States. This allowed the Sardinian government led by [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861. The capital of Italy was moved from Turin to Florence. In 1866, [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waging the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] which allowed Italy to annexe [[Veneto|Venetia]]. Finally, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap by [[Capture of Rome|taking over the Papal States]].

The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy participated as part of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] forces during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China. On 7 September 1901, a [[Italian concession of Tientsin|concession in Tientsin]] was ceded to the country, and on 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by a [[Consul (representative)|consul]].\n\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|The [[Altare della Patria]] in Rome, built in honor of [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], the first king of a unified Italy.

The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. In October 1922 the [[Blackshirts]] of the National Fascist Party attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] (the \"[[March on Rome]]\") which failed but at the last minute, King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a [[Totalitarianism|dictatorship]]. These actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Francoist Spain]].\n\nIn 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Ethiopia]] and founded the [[Italian East Africa]], resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]; Italy [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi Germany]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of Japan]] and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish civil war]].

In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from [[humid subtropical]] to [[humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. In particular, the climate of the [[Po valley]] geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers.<ref>Adriana Rigutti, ''Meteorologia'', Giunti, p. 95, 2009.</ref><ref>Thomas A.

Conditions on peninsular coastal areas can be very different from the interior's higher ground and valleys, particularly during the winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers, although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer. Average winter temperatures vary from {{convert|0|C|lk=on}} on the Alps to\n{{convert|12|C}} in Sicily, like so the average summer temperatures range from {{convert|20|C}} to over {{convert|25|C}}. Winters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold, foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder, sunnier conditions in the south. Summers can be hot and humid across the country, particularly in the south while northern and central areas can experience occasional strong thunderstorms from spring to autumn.<ref>{{cite web|title=Climate Atlas of Italy|url=http://clima.meteoam.it/atlanteClimatico.php?ling=eng|publisher=Network of the Air Force Meteorological Service|accessdate=30 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114223307/http://clima.meteoam.it/atlanteClimatico.php?ling=eng|archivedate=14 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\n{{Main|Politics of Italy}}\n\nItaly has been a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] since 2 June 1946, when the monarchy was abolished by a [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|constitutional referendum]]. The [[President of Italy]] (''Presidente della Repubblica''), currently [[Sergio Mattarella]] since 2015, is Italy's [[head of state]]. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the [[Parliament of Italy]] and some regional voters in [[joint session]]. Italy has a written democratic [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]], resulting from the work of a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] formed by the representatives of all the [[anti-fascist]] forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the [[Italian Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>Smyth, Howard McGaw Italy: From Fascism to the Republic (1943\u20131946) ''The Western Political Quarterly'' vol. 1 no. 3 (pp. 205\u2013222), September 1948.{{jstor|442274}}</ref>\n\n=== Government ===\n{{multiple image\n| align    = right\n| image1   = Presidente Mattarella.jpg\n| width1   = 143\n| caption1 = <center>[[Sergio Mattarella]]<br><small>[[President of Italy]]<br>since 2015</small></center>\n| image2   = Giuseppe Conte Official.jpg\n| width2   = 137\n| caption2 = <center>[[Giuseppe Conte]]<br><small>[[Prime Minister of Italy]]<br>since 2018</small></center>\n}}\n\nItaly has a parliamentary government based on a mixed [[proportional representation|proportional]] and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly [[bicameral]]: the two houses, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] that meets in [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], and the [[Senate of Italy|Senate of the Republic]] that meets in [[Palazzo Madama]], have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]] (''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri''), is Italy's [[head of government]]. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic of Italy and must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. To remain the Prime Minister  has to pass also eventual further votes of confindence or no confidence in Parliament.\n\n[[File:Giuramento Mattarella Montecitorio.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] is the lower house of Italy.]]\n\nThe prime minister is the President of the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Council of Ministers]]\u2014which holds effective executive power\u2014 and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is similar to those in most other [[parliamentary system]]s, but the leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the [[Parliament of Italy]].\n\nAnother difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: co-ordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security; apply and protect State secrets; authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, in violation of the law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html|title=About us \u2013 Sistema di informazione per la sicurezza della Repubblica|website=www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329090926/http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html|archivedate=29 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA peculiarity of the [[Italian Parliament]] is the representation given to [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]] permanently living abroad: 12 Deputies and 6 Senators elected in four distinct [[Parliament of Italy#Overseas constituency|overseas constituencies]].

During the [[Renaissance]] Italian polymaths such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452\u20131519), [[Michelangelo]] (1475\u20131564) and [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404\u201372) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]].<br>\nOther astronomers suchs as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625\u20131712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835\u20131910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]]. In mathematics, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736\u20131813) was active before leaving Italy. [[Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 \u2013 c. 1250), and [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501\u201376) made fundamental advances in mathematics. [[Luca Pacioli]] established [[accounting]] to the world. Physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901\u201354), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and was one of the key figures in the creation of the [[nuclear weapon]]. He, [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] (1905\u201389) who discovered the elements [[technetium]] and [[astatine]], and the [[antiproton]]), [[Bruno Rossi]] (1905\u201393) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by [[Italian Racial Laws|Fascist laws against Jews]],.<ref>Lucia Orlando, \"Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the\" New Tasks\" of Physics in Italy.\" ''Historical studies in the physical and biological sciences'' (1998): 141\u2013181. {{jstor|27757806}}</ref>\n\nOther prominent physicists include: [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (most noted for his contributions to [[molecular theory]], in particular the [[Avogadro's law]] and the [[Avogadro constant]]), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (inventor of [[barometer]]), [[Alessandro Volta]] (inventor of [[electric battery]]), [[Guglielmo Marconi]] (inventor of [[radio]]), [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Antonio Pacinotti]], pioneers of the induction motor, [[Alessandro Cruto]], pioneer of light bulb and [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics, [[Ettore Majorana]] (who discovered the [[Majorana fermion]]s), [[Carlo Rubbia]] (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the [[W and Z particles]] at [[CERN]]).

Several of the finest works in Western architecture, such as the [[Colosseum]], the [[Milan Cathedral]] and [[Florence cathedral]], the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] and the building designs of [[Venice]] are found in Italy.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Canal Grande Chiesa della Salute e Dogana dal ponte dell Accademia.jpg|The city of [[Venice]], built on 117 islands\nFile:Pisa - Campo Santo - Campanile 2 - 2005-08-08 10-23 2005.JPG|The [[Leaning Tower of Pisa|Leaning Tower]] and the [[Duomo di Pisa|Duomo]] of [[Pisa]]\nFile:Reggia di Caserta, prospettiva dalla fontana di Venere e Adone - panoramio.jpg|The [[Royal Palace of Caserta]]\nFile:Castel del Monte BW 2016-10-14 12-26-11 r.jpg|[[Castel del Monte, Apulia|Castel del Monte]], built by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]\nFile:Agrigent BW 2012-10-07 13-09-13.jpg|[[Temple of Concordia, Agrigento|Temple of Concordia]] in the [[Valle dei Templi|Valley of the Temples]], [[Agrigento]]\n</gallery>\n\nItalian architecture has also widely influenced the architecture of the world.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main \"styles\" or periods<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726163006/http://art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |archivedate=26 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'\u0153il]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}</ref>\n\nPanel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons. Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]]. From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative. They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture.\n\n[[File:Michelangelo's David 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.9|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David]]'' (1501\u20131504), [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], Florence]]\n\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] is said by many to be the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy. In Italy artists like [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Masaccio]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Giorgione]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]'', ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]''. Other prominent Renaissance sculptors include [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], [[Luca Della Robbia]], [[Donatello]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].\n\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' (1484-86), [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]], Florence]]\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylised art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. In the 17th century, among the greatest painters of [[Italian Baroque]] are [[Caravaggio]], [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Carlo Saraceni]] and [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]]. Subsequently, in the 18th century, [[Italian Rococo art|Italian Rococo]] was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Canaletto]]. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with [[Antonio Canova]]'s nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.\n\nIn the 19th century, major Italian [[Romantic painting|Romantic]] painters were [[Francesco Hayez]], [[Giuseppe Bezzuoli]] and [[Francesco Podesti]]. [[Impressionism]] was brought from France to Italy by the ''[[Macchiaioli]]'', led by [[Giovanni Fattori]], and [[Giovanni Boldini]]; [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] by [[Gioacchino Toma]] and [[Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo]]. In the 20th century, with [[Futurism]], primarily through the works of [[Umberto Boccioni]] and [[Giacomo Balla]], Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture. Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of [[Giorgio de Chirico]], who exerted a strong influence on the [[Surrealists]] and generations of artists to follow.\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Literature of Italy}}\n\nItalian literature began after the founding of Rome in 753 BC. Latin literature was, and still is, highly influential in the world, with numerous writers, poets, philosophers, and historians, such as [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Pliny the Younger]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Propertius]], [[Ovid]] and [[Livy]]. The Romans were also famous for their oral tradition, poetry, drama and epigrams.<ref>{{Cite book|title=''Poetry and Drama: Literary Terms and Concepts.''|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|date=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHA_SydyKOYC&pg=PA39|accessdate=18 October 2011|isbn=9781615304905}}</ref> In early years of the 13th century, St. [[Francis of Assisi]] was considered the first Italian poet by literary critics, with his religious song ''[[Canticle of the Sun]]''.<ref>{{Cite book | chapter=2 \u2013 Poetry.

At the court of Emperor Frederick II, who ruled the Sicilian kingdom during the first half of the 13th century, lyrics modelled on Proven\u00e7al forms and themes were written in a refined version of the local vernacular. The most important of these poets was the notary [[Giacomo da Lentini]], inventor of the [[sonnet]] form, though the most famous early sonneteer was [[Petrarch]].<ref>Ernest Hatch Wilkins, ''The invention of the sonnet, and other studies in Italian literature'' (Rome: Edizioni di Storia e letteratura, 1959), 11\u201339</ref>\n\n[[Guido Guinizelli]] is considered the founder of the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]'', a school that added a philosophical dimension to traditional love poetry. This new understanding of love, expressed in a smooth, pure style, influenced [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and the [[Florence|Florentine]] poet [[Dante Alighieri]], who established the basis of the modern [[Italian language]]; his greatest work, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', is considered among the foremost literary statements produced in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]; furthermore, the poet invented the difficult ''[[terza rima]]''. The two great writers of the 14th century, Petrarch and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], sought out and imitated the works of antiquity and cultivated their own artistic personalities. Petrarch achieved fame through his collection of poems, ''[[Il Canzoniere]]''. Petrarch's love poetry served as a model for centuries.

Another important work of the period, [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', continuation of [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]]'s unfinished romance ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'', is perhaps the greatest chivalry poem ever written.

The works by [[Alessandro Manzoni]], the leading Italian Romantic, are a symbol of the Italian unification for their patriotic message and because of his efforts in the development of the modern, unified Italian language; his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' was the first Italian historical novel to glorify Christian values of justice and Providence, and it has been called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language.<ref name=\"Archibald Colquhoun 1954\">Archibald Colquhoun.

The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energising effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage. As with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists was heavily influenced or tended to adapt from the Greek. For example, Seneca's ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'' was based on that of [[Euripides]], and many of the comedies of [[Plautus]] were direct translations of works by [[Menander]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theatre and Drama in the Making|last=Gassner|first=John |publisher=Applause Theatre Books|year=1992|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 16th century and on into the 18th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] was a form of [[improvisational theatre]], and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]] and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called ''[[canovaccio]]''.  Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called [[lazzi]], which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The characters of the ''commedia'' usually represent fixed social types and [[stock character]]s, each of which has a distinct [[Costumes in commedia dell'arte|costume]], such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false [[bravery|bravado]].

The basic concepts of this music includes ''[[Shruti (music)|shruti]]'' (microtones), ''[[swaras]]'' (notes), ''[[alankar]]'' (ornamentations), ''[[raga]]'' (melodies improvised from basic grammars), and ''[[Tala (music)|tala]]'' (rhythmic patterns used in percussion). Its tonal system divides the octave into 22 segments called Shrutis, not all equal but each roughly equal to a quarter of a whole tone of the Western music.\n\n===Hindustani music===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n{{Main article|Hindustani classical music}}\nThe tradition of Hindustani music dates back to Vedic times where the hymns in the Sama Veda, an ancient religious text, were sung as Samagana and not chanted. It diverged from Carnatic music around the 13th-14th centuries CE, primarily due to Islamic influences.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Developing a strong and diverse tradition over several centuries, it has contemporary traditions established primarily in India but also in Pakistan and Bangladesh. In contrast to Carnatic music, the other main Indian classical music tradition originating from the South, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, historical [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic philosophy]] and native Indian sounds but also enriched by the [[Persian traditional music|Persian]] performance practices of the [[Mughal era|Mughals]]. Classical genres are [[dhrupad]], [[dhamar (music)|dhamar]], [[khyal]], [[tarana]] and [[sadra (music)|sadra]], and there are also several semi-classical forms.\n\n===Carnatic music===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Main article|Carnatic music}}\n\nCarnatic music can be traced to the 14th - 15th centuries AD and thereafter. It originated in South India during the rule of [[Vijayanagar Empire]]. Like Hindustani music, it is [[Melodic music|melodic]], with improvised variations, but tends to have more fixed compositions. It consists of a composition with improvised embellishments added to the piece in the forms of ''[[Alapana|Raga Alapana]]'', ''[[Kalpanaswaram]]'', ''[[Niraval|Neraval]]'' and, in the case of more advanced students, Raga, Tala, Pallavi. The main emphasis is on the vocals as most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in a singing style (known as ''g\u0101yaki''). Around 300 [[raga]]ms are in use today.\n[[Annamayya]] is the first known composer in Carnatic music. He is widely regarded as the Andhra Pada kavit\u0101 Pit\u0101maha (Godfather of Telugu song-writing).\n[[Purandara Dasa]] is considered the father of Carnatic music, while the later musicians [[Tyagaraja]], [[Shyama Shastry]] and [[Muthuswami Dikshitar]] are considered the trinity of Carnatic music.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nNoted artists of Carnatic music include [[Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar]] (the father of the current concert format), [[Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer]], [[Alathur Brothers]], [[MS Subbulakshmi]], [[Lalgudi Jayaraman]] and more recently [[Balamuralikrishna]], [[TN Seshagopalan]], [[K J Yesudas]], [[N. Ramani]], [[Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman]], [[Sanjay Subrahmanyan]], [[TM Krishna]], [[Bombay Jayashri]], [[T S Nandakumar]], [[Aruna Sairam]], and [[Mysore Manjunath]].\n\nEvery December, the city of [[Chennai]] in India has its eight-week-long [[Madras Music Season|Music Season]], which is the world's largest cultural event.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nCarnatic music has served as the foundation for most music in South India, including folk music, festival music and has also extended its influence to film music in the past 100\u2013150 years or so.\n\n==Light classical music==\nThere are many types of music which comes under the category of light classical or semi-classical. Some of the forms are [[Thumri]], [[Dadra]], [[Ghazal]], [[Chaiti]], [[Kajri]], [[Tappa]], [[Natya Sangeet]] and [[Qawwali]]. These forms place emphasis on explicitly seeking emotion from the audience, as opposed to the classical forms.\n\n==Folk music==\n[[File:Hira Devi Waiba.jpg|thumb|Hira Devi Waiba, pioneer of Nepali folk songs in India]]\n[[File:Jodhpur RIFF.jpg|right|thumb|Group of Dharohar [[Indian folk music|folk music]]ians performing in [[Mehrangarh Fort]], [[Jodhpur]], India]]\n{{Main article|Indian folk music}}\n\n=== Tamang Selo ===\n{{Main article|Tamang Selo}}\n\nThis is a genre of [[Music of Nepal|Nepali folk song]] of the [[Tamang people]] and popular amongst the Nepali speaking community in West Bengal, Sikkim and around the world.

The folk songs of [[Uttarakhand]] are a reflection of the cultural heritage and the way people live their lives in the Himalayas. Musical instruments used in [[Uttarakhand]] music include the Dhol, Damoun, Turri, Ransingha, Dholki, Daur, Thali, Bhankora and Masakbhaja. [[Tabla]] and [[Harmonium]] are also sometimes used, especially in recorded folk music from the 1960s onwards. Generic Indian and global musical instruments have been incorporated in modern popular folks by singers like Narendra Singh Negi, Mohan Upreti, Gopal Babu Goswami, and Chandra Singh Rahi.\n\n===Lavani===\n{{Main article|Lavani}}\n\n[[Lavani]] comes from the word ''Lavanya'' which means \"beauty\". This is one of the most popular forms of dance and music that is practiced all over [[Maharashtra]]. It has, in fact, become a necessary part of the Maharashtrian folk dance performances. Traditionally, the songs are sung by female artists, but male artists may occasionally sing [[Lavani]]s. The dance format associated with [[Lavani]] is known as [[Tamasha]]. Lavani is a combination of traditional song and dance, which particularly performed to the enchanting beats of 'Dholaki', a drum-like instrument. The dance is performed by attractive women wearing nine-yard saris. They are sung in a quick tempo. Lavani originated in the arid region of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.\n\n===Rajasthan===\n{{main article|Music of Rajasthan}}\n\n[[Rajasthan]] has a very diverse cultural collection of musician [[caste]]s, including [[Langha (tribe)|Langa]]s, [[Sapera]], [[Bhopa]], [[Jogi]] and [[Manganiyar]] (lit. \"the ones who ask/beg\"). ''Rajasthan Diary'' quotes it as a soulful, full-throated music with harmonious diversity. The melodies of Rajasthan come from a variety of instruments. The stringed variety includes the [[Sarangi]], [[Ravanahatha]], Kamayacha, Morsing and Ektara. Percussion instruments come in all shapes and sizes from the huge Nagaras and Dhols to the tiny Damrus. The Daf and Chang are a favorite of [[Holi]] (the festival of colours) revelers. Flutes and bagpipers come in local flavors such as Shehnai, Poongi, Algoza, Tarpi, Been and Bankia.\n\nRajasthani music is derived from a combination of string instruments, percussion instruments and wind instruments accompanied by renditions of folk singers. It enjoys a respectable presence in Bollywood music as well.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Popular music==\n\n===Filmi music===\n{{Main article|Filmi|Music of Bollywood}}\n\n\n[[file:Basi_Basistha_Jabali_Bamadeba.ogg|left|thumb|Sample of Odissi performance art with the 17th Canto from the 17th century Odia poet Upendra Bhanja's 'Baidehisha Bilasa' being sung.

Music composers, like [[R. D. Burman]], [[Shankar Jaikishan]], [[S. D. Burman]], [[Madan Mohan (music director)|Madan Mohan]], [[Bhupen Hazarika]], [[Naushad Ali]], [[O. P. Nayyar]], [[Hemant Kumar]], [[C. Ramchandra]], [[Salil Chowdhury]], [[Kalyanji Anandji]], [[Ilaiyaraaja]], [[A. R.

Viswanathan]], [[K. V. Mahadevan]], [[Ghantasala (singer)|Ghantasala]] and [[S. D. Batish]] employed the principles of harmony while retaining classical and folk flavor. Reputed names in the domain of Indian classical music like [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Vilayat Khan]], [[Ali Akbar Khan]] and [[Ram Narayan]] have also composed music for films. Traditionally, in Indian films, the voice for the songs is not provided by the actors, they are provided by the professional [[playback singer]]s, to sound more developed, melodious and soulful, while actors lipsynch on the screen. In the past, only a handful of singers provided the voice in Hindi films. These include [[Kishore Kumar]],[[K. J. Yesudas]], [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]], [[S.P. Balasubrahmanyam]], [[T.M. Soundararajan]], [[Hemant Kumar]], [[Manna Dey]], [[P. Susheela]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Asha Bhonsle]], [[K.S. Chitra]], [[Geeta Dutt]], [[S. Janaki]], [[Shamshad Begum]], [[Suraiya]], [[Noorjahan]] and [[Suman Kalyanpur]]. Recent playback singers include [[Udit Narayan]], [[Kumar Sanu]], [[Kailash Kher]], [[Alisha Chinai]], [[KK (singer)|KK]], [[Shaan (singer)|Shaan]], [[Madhushree]], [[Shreya Ghoshal]], [[Nihira Joshi]], [[Kavita Krishnamurthy]], [[Hariharan (singer)]], [[Ilaiyaraaja]], [[A.R. Rahman]], [[Sonu Nigam]], [[Sukhwinder Singh]], [[Kunal Ganjawala]], [[Anu Malik]], [[Sunidhi Chauhan]], [[Anushka Manchanda]], [[Raja Hasan]], [[Arijit Singh]] and [[Alka Yagnik]]. Rock bands like [[Indus Creed]], [[Indian Ocean (band)|Indian Ocean]], [[Silk Route (band)|Silk Route]] and [[Euphoria (Indian band)|Euphoria]] have gained mass appeal with the advent of cable music television.\n\n===Interaction with non-Indian music===\n{{see also|Indo jazz|Raga rock|Psychedelic music|Indo-Caribbean music|Asian Underground|Bhangra (music)}}\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[rock and roll]] fusions with Indian music were well known throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. [[Ali Akbar Khan]]'s 1955 performance in the [[United States]] was perhaps the beginning of this trend.\n\n[[Jazz]] pioneers such as [[John Coltrane]]\u2014who recorded a composition entitled 'India' during the November 1961 sessions for his album [[Village Vanguard|''Live At The Village Vanguard'']] (the track was not released until 1963 on [[John Coltrane|Coltrane]]'s album ''[[Impressions (John Coltrane album)|Impressions]]'')\u2014also embraced this fusion. [[George Harrison]] (of [[the Beatles]]) played the [[sitar]] on the song \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\" in 1965, which sparked interest from Shankar, who subsequently took Harrison as his apprentice. [[Jazz]] innovator [[Miles Davis]] recorded and performed with musicians like Khalil Balakrishna, Bihari Sharma, and Badal Roy in his post-1968 electric ensembles. Virtuoso jazz guitarist John McLaughlin spent several years in Madurai learning Carnatic music and incorporated it into many of his acts including Shakti which featured prominent Indian musicians. Other Western artists such as the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Incredible String Band]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Move]] and [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] soon incorporated Indian influences and instruments, and added Indian performers.\nLegendary Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia joined guitarist Sanjay Mishra on his classic CD \"Blue Incantation\" (1995). Mishra also wrote an original score for French Director Eric Heumann for his film ''Port Djema'' (1996) which won best score at Hamptons film festival and The Golden Bear at Berlin. in 2000 he recorded ''Rescue'' with drummer Dennis Chambers (Carlos Santana, John McLaughlin et al.) and in 2006 Chateau Benares with guests DJ Logic and Keller Williams (guitar and bass).\n\nThough the Indian music craze soon died down among mainstream audiences, die-hard fans and immigrants continued the fusion. In 1985, a beat-oriented, Raga Rock hybrid called Sitar Power by [[Ashwin Batish]] reintroduced sitar in western nations. Sitar Power drew the attention of a number of record labels and was snapped up by Shanachie Records of New Jersey to head their World Beat Ethno Pop division.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Indian-British artists fused Indian and Western traditions to make the [[Asian Underground]]. Since the 1990s, Canadian born musician [[Nadaka]] who has spent most of his life in India, has been creating music that is an acoustic fusion of Indian classical music with western styles. One such singer who has merged the Bhakti sangeet tradition of India with the western non-Indian music is [[Krishna Das (singer)|Krishna Das]] and sells music records of his musical [[sadhana]]. Another example is the Indo-Canadian musician [[Vandana Vishwas]] who has experimented with western music in her 2013 album ''Monologues''.\n\nIn the new millennium, American [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] has featured Indian filmi and bhangra. Mainstream hip-hop artists have sampled songs from Bollywood movies and have collaborated with Indian artists.  Examples include [[Timbaland]]'s \"Indian Flute\", [[Erick Sermon]] and [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]]'s \"React\", Slum Village's \"Disco\", and [[Truth Hurts]]' hit song \"Addictive\", which sampled a [[Lata Mangeshkar]] song, and [[The Black Eyed Peas]] sampled [[Asha Bhosle]]'s song \"Yeh Mera Dil\" in their hit single \"[[Don't Phunk With My Heart]]\". In 1997, the British band [[Cornershop (band)|Cornershop]] paid tribute to [[Asha Bhosle]] with their song ''[[Brimful of Asha]]'', which became an international hit. [[United Kingdom|British]]-born Indian artist [[Panjabi MC]] also had a Bhangra hit in the U.S. with \"Mundian To Bach Ke\" which featured rapper [[Jay-Z]]. [[Asian Dub Foundation]] are not huge mainstream stars, but their politically charged [[hip hop music|rap]] and [[punk rock]] influenced sound has a multi-racial audience in their native UK. In 2008, international star [[Snoop Dogg]] appeared in a song in the film [[Singh Is Kinng]]. In 2007, hip-hop producer [[Madlib]] released [[Beat Konducta Vol 3\u20134: Beat Konducta in India]]; an album which heavily samples and is inspired by the music of India.\n\nSometimes, the music of India will fuse with the traditional music of other countries. For example, [[Delhi 2 Dublin]], a band based in Canada, is known for fusing Indian and [[music of Ireland|Irish]] music, and [[Bhangraton]] is a fusion of [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]] music with [[reggaeton]], which itself is a fusion of hip hop, reggae, and traditional [[Latin American music]].<ref>[http://www.reggaetonline.net/luny-tunes-04262006_inside-reggaeton reggaetonline.net]</ref>\n\nIn a more recent example of Indian-British fusion, [[Laura Marling]] along with [[Mumford and Sons]] collaborated in 2010 with the [[Dharohar Project]] on a four-song EP.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC review |title=A triumphant experiment that feels surprisingly authentic |first= Colin |last=Irwin |date=2010-09-03 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/rqzb}}</ref> The British band [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] also sampled the song \"[[Nagin (1954 film)#Soundtrack|Man Dole Mera Tan Dole]]\" for their single \"[[So Long, See You Tomorrow (album)|Feel]]\".<ref>{{cite news | publisher= ''Indian Express'' |title= A Little This, A Little That |first= Pallavi |last= Pundir | date= March 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Indian pop music===\n{{main article|Indian pop}}\n{{see also|Asian Underground|Bhangra (music)|Bhangragga}}\n\nIndian pop music is based on an amalgamation of Indian folk and classical music, and modern beats from different parts of the world. Pop music really started in the [[South Asian]] region with the playback singer [[Ahmed Rushdi]]'s song \u2018''Ko Ko Korina''\u2019 in 1966, followed initially by [[Mohammad Rafi]] in the late 1960s and then by [[Kishore Kumar]] in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"CITEREFSocPolHistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chowk.com/articles/8459|title=Socio-political History of Modern Pop Music in Pakistan|publisher=[[Chowk.com|Chowk]]|accessdate=2008-06-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618091924/http://www.chowk.com/articles/8459|archivedate=2010-06-18|df=}}</ref>\n\nAfter that, much of Indian Pop music comes from the [[Indian Film Industry]], and until the 1990s, few singers like [[Usha Uthup]], [[Sharon Prabhakar]], and [[Penaz Masani|Peenaz Masani]] outside it were popular.

Raga and other forms of classical Indian music began to influence many rock groups during the 1960s; most famously [[the Beatles]].

The band is known for being the pioneer of [[metal music]] in [[Central India]].]]\n\nThe rock music \"scene\" in India is small compared to the filmi or fusion musicality \"scenes\" but as of recent years has come into its own, achieving a cult status of sorts. Rock music in India has its origins in the 1960s when international stars such as [[the Beatles]] visited India and brought their music with them. These artists' collaboration with Indian musicians such as [[Ravi Shankar]] and [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]] have led to the development of [[raga rock]]. International shortwave radio stations such as The Voice of America, BBC, and Radio Ceylon played a major part in bringing Western pop, folk, and rock music to the masses. Indian rock bands began to gain prominence only much later, around the late 1980s.\n\nIt was around this time that the rock band [[Indus Creed]] formerly known as The Rock Machine got itself noticed on the international stage with hits like ''Rock N Roll Renegade''. Other bands quickly followed. As of now, the rock music scene in India is quietly growing day by day and gathering more support. With the introduction of MTV in the early 1990s, Indians began to be exposed to various forms of rock such as grunge and speed metal. This influence can be clearly seen in many Indian bands today. The cities of the North Eastern Region, mainly Guwahati and [[Shillong]], [[Kolkata]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Bangalore]] have emerged as major melting pots for rock and metal enthusiasts. Bangalore has been the hub for rock and metal movement in India. Some prominent bands include [[Nicotine (band)|Nicotine]], [[Voodoo Child (band)|Voodoo Child]], [[Indian Ocean (band)|Indian Ocean]], [[Kryptos (band)|Kryptos]], [[Thermal and a Quarter]], [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Motherjane]], [[Avial (band)|Avial]], and [[Parikrama (band)|Parikrama]]. The future looks encouraging thanks to entities such as [[DogmaTone]] Records and [[Eastern Fare Music Foundation]] that are dedicated to promoting and supporting Indian rock.\n\nFrom Central India, [[Nicotine (band)|Nicotine]], an Indore-based metal band, is widely credited of being the pioneer of [[metal music]] in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dnasyndication.com/dna/article/DNIND3926|title=Does Indore have the mettle for metal?    - DNA - English News & Features - Art & Culture - dnasyndication.com<|work=dnasyndication.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationinsider.net/detail_news.php?id=731|title=Metal mania|work=educationinsider.net|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://epaper.dnaindia.com/story.aspx?id=42518&boxid=63886&ed_date=2014-01-06&ed_code=820076&ed_page=1|title=Indore has a bandtastic time!|work=dnaindia.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinlung.com/2011/01/10-famous-rock-bands-of-india.html|title=The 10 Famous Rock Bands of India - Sinlung|work=sinlung.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaonline.in/About/Culture/Best-Rock-Bands-In-India.html|title=Best Rock Bands In India|work=indiaonline.in|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkthroughindia.com/hot-trends/the-10-famous-rock-bands-of-india/|title=The 10 Famous Rock Bands of India|work=walkthroughindia.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2013/07/almost-there-6-awesome-indian-music-bands-to-look-forward-to/|title=Almost There: 6 Awesome Indian Music Bands To Look Forward To|work=Youth Ki Awaaz|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.witty9.com/list-of-top-10-famous-rock-bands-who-gave-a-new-defination-to-the-music/|title=# 12 Prominent Indian Rock Bands Who Gave a New Definition To The Music.|work=Witty9|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.india.com/articles/12-cities-home-awesome-bands-probably-dint-know/|title=12 Cities That are Home to Awesome Bands and You Probably Din't Know It!|work=Travel India|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toplisthub.com/top-10-rock-bands-in-india/|title=Top 10 Rock Bands in India|author=Neelima K|work=Top List Hub|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://epaper.dnaindia.com/epapermain.aspx?pgNo=4&edcode=820076&eddate=2013-6-26|title=DNA E-Paper - Daily News & Analysis -Mumbai, India|work=dnaindia.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Dance music===\n{{Main article|Dance in India|Hindi Dance Music|Music of Bollywood|Goa trance|Psychedelic trance|Charanjit Singh (musician)|Electronica}}\n\n==Jazz and blues==\n{{main article|Jazz in India|Indian blues}}\n\n==Western classical music==\nThe spread and following of Western classical music in India is almost entirely non-existent.

Western keyboard, drums and guitar instruction being an exception as it has found some interest; mainly in an effort to create musicians to service contemporary popular Indian music. Many reasons have been cited for the obscurity of Western classical music in India, a country rich in its musical heritage by its own right, however, the two main reasons are an utter lack of exposure and a passive disinterest in what is considered esoteric at best.

It is a variety of [[UNIX System V]] with [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] extensions. IRIX is the first operating system to include the [[XFS]] file system.\n\nThe last major version of IRIX is IRIX 6.5, which was released in May 1998. New minor versions of IRIX 6.5 were released every quarter until 2005; since then there have been four further minor releases. Through version 6.5.22, there are two branches of each release: a [[maintenance release]] (identified by an ''m'' suffix to the version number) that includes only fixes to the original IRIX 6.5 code, and a ''feature'' release (with an ''f'' suffix) that includes improvements and enhancements. An overlay upgrade from 6.5.x to the 6.5.22 maintenance release is available as a free download, whereas versions 6.5.23 and higher require an active Silicon Graphics support contract.\n\n==History==\nThe IRIX name was first used around the time of release 3.0 of the operating system for SGI's IRIS 4D series of workstations and servers, in 1988. Previous releases are identified only by the release number prefixed by \"4D1-\", e.g. \"4D1-2.2\". The 4D1- prefix continued to be used in official documentation to prefix IRIX release numbers.\n\nIRIX 3.x is based on [[UNIX System V]] Release 3 with [[4.3BSD]] enhancements, and incorporates the 4Sight [[windowing system]], based on [[NeWS]] and [[IRIS GL]]. SGI's own [[Extent File System]] (EFS) replaces the System V filesystem.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web\n|url=http://ryan.tliquest.net/sgi/irix_versions.html\n|title=History of IRIX\n|accessdate=2007-11-02\n|date=2007-01-18\n}}</ref>\n\nIRIX 4.0, released in 1991, replaces 4Sight with the [[X Window System]] (X11R4), the [[4Dwm]] [[window manager]] providing a similar look and feel to 4Sight.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIRIX 5.0, released in 1993, incorporates certain features of UNIX System V Release 4, including [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] executables. IRIX 5.3 introduced the [[XFS]] [[journaling file system]].\n\nIn 1994, IRIX 6.0 added support for the 64-bit MIPS [[R8000]] processor, but is otherwise similar to IRIX 5.2. Later 6.x releases support other members of the MIPS processor family in 64-bit mode. IRIX 6.3 was released for the [[SGI O2]] workstation only.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.sgistuff.net/software/irixhistory/index.html\n|title=SGIstuff : Software : Irix Versions\n|accessdate=2007-11-02\n}}</ref>  IRIX 6.4 improved [[multiprocessor]] scalability for the [[SGI Octane|Octane]], [[SGI Origin 2000|Origin 2000]], and [[SGI Onyx2|Onyx2]] systems. The Origin 2000 and Onyx2 IRIX 6.4 was marketed as \"Cellular IRIX\", although it only incorporates some features from the original Cellular IRIX [[distributed operating system]] project. IRIX development stabilized with IRIX 6.5, released in 1998. The last version of IRIX is 6.5.30, released in August 2006.\n\nA 2001 ''[[Computerworld]]'' review found IRIX in a \"critical\" state. SGI had been moving its efforts to [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]],{{efn|See [[SGI Visual Workstation]].}} but MIPS/IRIX customers convinced SGI to continue to support their platform through 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2584450/operating-systems/vital-signs-for-unix.html|title=Vital Signs for Unix|author=Tom Yager|newspaper=[[Computerworld]]|date=November 19, 2001|accessdate=June 6, 2015}}</ref> On September 6 of that year, an SGI press release announced the end of the MIPS/IRIX product line.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.sgi.com/support/mips_irix.html\n|title=SGI - Services & Support: End of General Availability for MIPS IRIX Products\n|accessdate=2007-11-02\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071019230510/http://www.sgi.com/support/mips_irix.html |archivedate = 2007-10-19}}</ref> Production ended on December 29, 2006, with last deliveries in March 2007, except by special arrangement.

IRIX is one of the first Unix versions to feature a [[graphical user interface]] for the main desktop environment. IRIX was widely used for the whole decade of 1990, continuing into the 2000s, in the [[computer animation]] industry and for [[scientific visualization]] due to its large application base. It still is relevant in a few legacy applications.\n\nIn the early 1990s, IRIX was a leader in [[Symmetric multiprocessing|Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP)]], scalable from 1 to greater than 1024 processors with a single system image.\n\nIRIX uses the [[Indigo Magic Desktop]], which by default uses the [[4Dwm]] [[X window manager]] with a custom look designed using the [[Motif (software)|Motif widget toolkit]].\n\nIRIX uses the [[Open64|MIPSPro]] 7.4 Compiler for both its front end and back end.  The compiler is designed to support parallel [[POSIX]] programming in C/C++, Fortran 77/90, and Ada. The Workshop GUI IDE is used for development.  Other tools include Speedshop for performance tuning, and [[Performance Co-Pilot]].<ref>[http://docs.cray.com/books/S-6504-631/html-S-6504-631/platforms/SGI.html docs.cray.com, SGI IRIX 6.x MIPS]</ref>\n\nIRIX also supports [[OpenGL]] for graphics chips and Image processing libraries.\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:IRIX software|IRIX software]]\n* [[Silicon Graphics Image]] format about <code>.iris</code>\n* [[SGI O2]]\n* [[SGI Indy]]\n* [[Cray]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.sgi.com/products/software/irix/ Overview of information related to the IRIX operating system]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/19990908040522/http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/init.cgi Technical Publications Library]\n* [http://www.siliconbunny.com/ Silicon Bunny - IRIX software and information]\n* [http://www.irix.cc/ Irix Network - IRIX software, information, forums, and archive]\n* [http://www.nekochan.net/ Nekochan - IRIX open source software, information and forums]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060818192713/http://www.cepba.upc.es/docs/sgi_doc/SGI_Admin/books/IA_BakSecAcc/sgi_html/index.html IRIX Admin: Backup, Security, and Accounting] Document Number: 007-2862-004 February 1999\n\n{{Silicon Graphics}}\n{{unix-like}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Irix}}\n[[Category:Discontinued operating systems]]\n[[Category:IRIX| ]]\n[[Category:MIPS operating systems]]\n[[Category:UNIX System V]]", "sha1": "2aez8jfsztx2mtgeuqmvu81c22mckif"}}, {"title": "Internet", "ns": "0", "id": "14539", "revision": {"id": "864552363", "parentid": "861828408", "timestamp": "2018-10-17T23:37:32Z", "contributor": {"username": "Kbrose", "id": "3938795"}, "comment": "sp", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the worldwide computer network}}\n{{distinguish|text=the [[World Wide Web]]}}\n{{pp-semi-indef}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Internet}}\n{{Area networks}}\n\n[[File:Internet users per 100 and GDP per capita.jpg|thumb|Internet users per 100 population members and [[GDP]] per capita for selected countries.]]\n<!-- The Internet and the WWW are different concepts \u2013 please do not muddle them in this article :) -->\nThe '''Internet''' is the global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s that use the [[Internet protocol suite]] (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.

Although the Internet was widely used by [[academia]] since the 1980s, the [[commercialization of the Internet|commercialization]] incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.\n\nMost traditional communications media, including telephony, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as [[email]], [[Internet telephony]], [[Internet television]], [[online music]], digital newspapers, and [[video streaming]] websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to [[Web site|website]] technology, or are reshaped into [[blogging]], [[web feed]]s and online [[news aggregator]]s. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through [[instant messaging]], [[Internet forum]]s, and [[social network service|social networking]]. [[Online shopping]] has grown exponentially both for major retailers and [[small business]]es and [[entrepreneur]]s, as it enables firms to extend their \"[[brick and mortar]]\" presence to serve a larger market or even [[Online store|sell goods and services entirely online]].  [[Business-to-business]] and [[financial services]] on the Internet affect [[supply chain]]s across entire industries.\n\nThe Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies.<ref>[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/who-owns-internet.htm \"Who owns the Internet?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619070159/http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/who-owns-internet.htm |date=19 June 2014 }}, Jonathan Strickland, ''How Stuff Works''.

The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain interoperability, the principal [[name space]]s of the Internet are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet.  This role of ICANN distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet.<ref>Klein, Hans. (2004).

End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the [[tier 1 network]]s, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speed [[fibre optic cable]]s and governed by [[peering]] agreements. [[Tier 2 network|Tier 2]] and lower level networks buy [[Internet transit]] from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement [[multihoming]] to achieve redundancy and load balancing. [[Internet exchange point]]s are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as [[GEANT]], [[GLORIAD]], [[Internet2]], and the UK's [[national research and education network]], [[JANET]].

The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/ |title=IETF Home Page |publisher=Ietf.org |accessdate=20 June 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618032558/http://www.ietf.org/ |archivedate=18 June 2009 |df= }}</ref> The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting contributions and standards are published as ''[[Request for Comments]]'' (RFC) documents on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the [[Internet Standard]]s. Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.\n\nThe Internet standards describe a framework known as the [[Internet protocol suite]]. This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols, originally documented in {{IETF RFC|1122}} and {{IETF RFC|1123}}. The layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the [[application layer]], space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the [[client-server]] application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a [[peer-to-peer]] paradigm. Below this top layer, the [[transport layer]] connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods.\n\nUnderlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. The [[Internet layer]] enables computers to identify and locate each other via [[IP address|Internet Protocol (IP) addresses]], and routes their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks. Last, at the bottom of the architecture is the [[link layer]], which provides logical connectivity between hosts on the same network link, such as a [[local area network]] (LAN) or a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]]. The model, also known as [[TCP/IP]], is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware used for the physical connections, which the model does not concern itself with in any detail. Other models have been developed, such as the [[OSI model]], that attempt to be comprehensive in every aspect of communications. While many similarities exist between the models, they are not compatible in the details of description or implementation. Yet, TCP/IP protocols are usually included in the discussion of OSI networking.\n\n[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|As user data is processed through the protocol stack, each abstraction layer adds encapsulation information at the sending host. Data is transmitted ''over the wire'' at the link level between hosts and routers. Encapsulation is removed by the receiving host. Intermediate relays update link encapsulation at each hop, and inspect the IP layer for routing purposes.]]\n\nThe most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides addressing systems, including [[IP address]]es, for computers on the network. IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) is the initial version used on the first generation of the Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ~4.3 billion (10<sup>9</sup>) hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], which entered its final stage in 2011,<ref>{{cite web|last=Huston |first=Geoff |title=IPv4 Address Report, daily generated |url=http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html |accessdate=20 May 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401001902/http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html |archivedate=1 April 2009 |df= }}</ref> when the global address allocation pool was exhausted.  A new protocol version, IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. [[IPv6]] is currently in growing [[IPv6 deployment|deployment]] around the world, since Internet address registries ([[Regional Internet registry|RIRs]]) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arin.net/knowledge/about_resources/ceo_letter.pdf |title=Notice of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Address Depletion |format=PDF |accessdate=7 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107095025/https://www.arin.net/knowledge/about_resources/ceo_letter.pdf |archivedate=7 January 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIPv6 is not directly interoperable by design with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., [[peering agreement]]s, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.\n\n== Services ==\nThe Internet carries many [[network service]]s, most prominently [[mobile app]]s such as [[social media]] apps, the [[World Wide Web]], [[electronic mail]], [[multiplayer online game]]s, [[Internet telephony]], and [[file sharing]] services.\n\n=== World Wide Web ===\n{{Main|World Wide Web}}\n[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|This [[NeXT Computer]] was used by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]] and became the world's first [[Web server]].]]\n\nMany people use, erroneously, the terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'', or just the ''Web'', interchangeably, but the two terms are not synonymous.

[[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web.

Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial [[cost]] and many cost-free services are available. However, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies and groups use ''web logs'' or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage [[employees|staff]] to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.\n\n[[Online advertising|Advertising]] on popular web pages can be lucrative, and [[e-commerce]], which is the sale of products and services directly via the Web, continues to grow. Online advertising is a form of [[marketing]] and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver [[promotion (marketing)|promotional]] marketing messages to consumers.  It includes email marketing, [[search engine marketing]] (SEM), social media marketing, many types of [[display advertising]] (including [[web banner]] advertising), and [[mobile advertising]]. In 2011, Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of [[cable television]] and nearly exceeded those of [[broadcast television]].<ref name=\"IAB2012\">{{cite web |url= http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Internet_Advertising_Revenue_Report_FY_2012_rev.pdf |title= IAB internet advertising revenue report: 2012 full year results |date = April 2013 |publisher = PricewaterhouseCoopers, Internet Advertising Bureau |accessdate = 12 June 2013 }}</ref>{{rp|19}} Many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation.\n\nWhen the Web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in [[HTML]], complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating a flexible design, layout, and content. Websites are often created using [[content management]] software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form. There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.\n\n=== Communication ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}\n\n[[Email]] is an important communications service available on the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the Internet. Pictures, documents, and other files are sent as [[email attachment]]s. Emails can be [[Carbon copy|cc-ed]] to multiple [[email address]]es.\n\n[[Internet telephony]] is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the Internet. [[VoIP]] stands for Voice-over-[[Internet Protocol]], referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with [[walkie-talkie]]-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as [[Cable modem|cable]] or [[ADSL]]. VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.\n\nVoice quality can still vary from call to call, but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include [[emergency telephone number]] dialing and reliability. Currently, a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. Older traditional phones with no \"extra features\" may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure; VoIP can never do so without a [[uninterruptible power supply|backup power source]] for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include [[Ventrilo]] and [[Teamspeak]]. Modern video game consoles also offer VoIP chat features.\n\n=== Data transfer ===\n[[File sharing]] is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A [[computer file]] can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a \"shared location\" or onto a [[file server]] for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of \"[[Web mirror|mirror]]\" servers or [[peer-to-peer]] networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user [[authentication]], the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by [[encryption]], and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed \u2013 usually fully encrypted \u2013 across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by [[digital signature]]s or by [[MD5]] or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.\n\n[[Streaming media]] is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet \"broadcasters\" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical [[webcast]]s to on-demand popular multimedia services. [[Podcast]]ing is a variation on this theme, where \u2013 usually audio \u2013 material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a [[portable media player]] to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.\n\nDigital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth.  For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morrison |first=Geoff |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40241749/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets |title=What to know before buying a 'connected' TV \u2013 Technology & science \u2013 Tech and gadgets \u2013 Tech Holiday Guide |publisher=MSNBC |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628201811/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40241749/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets |archivedate=28 June 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[Webcam]]s are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the [[Panama Canal]], traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video [[chat rooms]] and [[video conferencing]] are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with a vast number of users. It uses a HTML5 based web player by default to stream and show video files.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html|title=YouTube now defaults to HTML5 <video>|work=YouTube Engineering and Developers Blog|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US}}</ref> Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. [[YouTube]] claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily.\n\n== Social impact ==\nThe Internet has enabled new forms of social interaction, activities, and social associations.

Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and were more likely to be broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email).

The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through [[mobile Internet device]]s. Mobile phones, [[datacard]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[cellular router]]s allow users to connect to the Internet [[wireless]]ly. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.\n\nEducational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from [[CBeebies]], through school and high-school revision guides and [[Virtual university|virtual universities]], to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of [[Google Scholar]]. For [[distance education]], help with [[homework]] and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the [[World Wide Web]] in particular are important enablers of both [[Education|formal]] and [[informal education]]. Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.<ref>Reips, U.-D.

Retrieved 22 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills have made [[collaboration|collaborative]] work dramatically easier, with the help of [[collaborative software]]. Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the [[free software movement]], which has produced, among other things, [[Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] (later forked into [[LibreOffice]]). Internet chat, whether using an [[IRC]] chat room, an [[instant messaging]] system, or a [[social networking]] website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day.  Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.\n\n[[Content management]] systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and [[computer literacy]] spread.\n\nThe Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with [[computer security]], i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can [[audit]] the books of a company based in another country, on a [[server (computing)|server]] situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private [[leased line]]s would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using [[cloud computing]], or open a [[Remote Desktop Protocol|remote desktop]] session into their office PC using a secure [[virtual private network]] (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among [[system administrator]]s as the Virtual Private Nightmare,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Virtual Private Nightmare: VPN |url=http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |publisher=Librenix |accessdate=21 July 2010 |date=4 August 2004 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515152637/http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df= }}</ref> because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.\n\n=== Social networking and entertainment ===\n{{See also|Social networking service#Social impact}}\nMany people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests. People use [[online chat|chat]], messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. [[Social network service|Social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Myspace]] have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like [[LinkedIn]] foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and [[Flickr]] specialize in users' videos and photographs. While social networking sites were initially for individuals only, today they are widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to \"[[Viral marketing|go viral]]\". \"Black hat\" social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as [[Spamming|spam]] accounts and [[astroturfing]].\n\nA risk for both individuals and organizations writing posts (especially public posts) on social networking websites, is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other Internet users. This is also a risk in relation to controversial ''offline'' behavior, if it is widely made known. The nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and [[hate speech]], to, in extreme cases, rape and death [[Computer crime#Threats|threats]]. The [[online disinhibition effect]] describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person. A significant number of [[feminist]] women have been the target of various forms of [[harassment]] in response to posts they have made on social media, and Twitter in particular has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |title=Twitter 'report abuse' button calls after rape threats |last=Moore |first=Keith |date=27 July 2013 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=7 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904014545/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |archivedate=4 September 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nFor organizations, such a backlash can cause overall [[public relations|brand damage]], especially if reported by the media. However, this is not always the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others. Furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash.\n\nSome websites, such as [[Reddit]], have rules forbidding the posting of [[personal information]] of individuals (also known as [[doxxing]]), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be [[censored]] in Facebook [[screenshots]] posted to Reddit. However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts they disagree with.\n\nChildren also face dangers online such as [[cyberbullying]] and [[Child grooming|approaches by sexual predators]], who sometimes pose as children themselves. Children may also encounter material which they may find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable [[Content-control software|Internet filtering]], and/or supervise their children's online activities, in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet.

Websites, such as [[DonorsChoose]] and [[GlobalGiving]], allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice. A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of [[peer-to-peer lending]] for charitable purposes. [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary [[microfinance]] organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay.

In 2009, the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] tapped into this trend to offer the first person-to-person microfinance platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without intermediaries. Members can fund loans for as little as a dollar, which the borrowers then use to develop business activities that improve their families' incomes while repaying loans to the members with interest. Borrowers access the Internet via public cybercafes, donated laptops in village schools, and even smart phones, then create their own profile pages through which they share photos and information about themselves and their businesses. As they repay their loans, borrowers continue to share updates and dialogue with lenders via their profile pages. This direct web-based connection allows members themselves to take on many of the communication and recording tasks traditionally performed by local organizations, bypassing geographic barriers and dramatically reducing the cost of microfinance services to the entrepreneurs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228000309/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia|title=\"Zidisha Set to \"Expand\" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance\"|publisher=Microfinance Focus|date=7 February 2010|archivedate=28 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\n{{Main|Internet security}}\nInternet resources, hardware, and software components are the target of criminal or malicious attempts to gain unauthorized control to cause interruptions, commit fraud, engage in blackmail or access private information.\n\n===Malware===\n{{main|Malware}}\nMalicious software used and spread on the Internet includes [[computer virus]]es which copy with the help of humans, [[computer worm]]s which copy themselves automatically, software for [[denial of service attack]]s, [[ransomware]], [[botnet]]s, and [[spyware]] that reports on the activity and typing of users.

The mechanized [[assembly line]] was introduced to assemble parts in a repeatable fashion, with individual workers performing specific steps during the process. This led to significant increases in efficiency, lowering the cost of the end process. Later [[automation]] was increasingly used to replace human operators. This process has accelerated with the development of the [[computer]] and the [[robot]].\n\n== Deindustrialisation ==\n{{main|Deindustrialisation}}\n[[File:Clark's Sector Model.png|thumb|upright=2.05|Colin Clark (economist)|[[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]]'s sector model of an economy undergoing technological change. In later stages, the [[Quaternary sector of the economy]] grows.]]\n\nHistorically certain manufacturing industries have gone into a decline due to various economic factors, including the development of replacement technology or the loss of competitive advantage. An example of the former is the decline in [[carriage]] manufacturing when the [[automobile]] was mass-produced.\n\nA recent trend has been the migration of prosperous, industrialized nations towards a [[post-industrial society]]. This is manifested by an increase in the [[service sector]] at the expense of manufacturing, and the development of an information-based economy, the so-called [[informational revolution]]. In a post-industrial society, manufacturers relocate to more profitable locations through a process of [[off-shoring]].\n\nMeasurements of manufacturing industries outputs and economic effect are not historically stable. Traditionally, success has been measured in the number of jobs created. The reduced number of employees in the manufacturing sector has been assumed to result from a decline in the competitiveness of the sector, or the introduction of the [[lean manufacturing]] process.\n\nRelated to this change is the upgrading of the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of the product being manufactured. While it is possible to produce a low-technology product with low-skill labour, the ability to manufacture high-technology products well is dependent on a highly skilled staff.\n\n== Society ==\n{{main|Industrial society}}\nAn [[industrial society]] is a society driven by the use of [[technology]] to enable [[mass production]], supporting a [[Population growth|large population]] with a high capacity for [[division of labour]]. Today, industry is an important part of most societies and nations. A government must have some kind of [[industrial policy]], regulating industrial placement, [[pollution|industrial pollution]], [[financing]] and [[industrial labour]].\n\n== Industrial labour ==\n[[File:Worker 9.JPG|thumb|An industrial [[worker]] amidst heavy steel components (KINEX BEARINGS, [[Byt\u010da]], [[Slovakia]], c. 1995\u20132000)]]\n{{main|Industrial labour}}\n{{further|industrial sociology|industrial and organizational psychology|industrial district|industrial park}}\nIn an industrial society, industry employs a major part of the population. This occurs typically in the manufacturing sector. A labour union is an organization of workers who have banded together to achieve common goals in key areas such as wages, hours, and other working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members ([[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] members) and negotiates labour contracts with employers. This [[labour movement|movement]] first rose among industrial workers.\n\n== War ==\n{{main|Industrial warfare}}\n[[File:Airacobra P39 Assembly LOC 02902u.jpg|thumb|The assembly plant of the [[Bell Aircraft Corporation]] ([[Wheatfield, New York]], United States, 1944) producing [[P-39 Airacobra]] fighters]]\nThe Industrial Revolution changed warfare, with [[mass-produced]] weaponry and supplies, machine-powered transportation, [[mobilization]], the [[total war]] concept and [[weapons of mass destruction]].

They are medium- to large-sized [[lemur]]s, with only four teeth in the toothcomb instead of the usual six. '''Indriids''', like all lemurs, live exclusively on the island of [[Madagascar]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe 10 extant Indriidae species vary considerably in size. Not counting the length of their tails, the [[woolly lemur|avahis]] are only {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, while the [[indri]] is the largest extant strepsirrhine. The tail of the indri is only a stub, while avahi and the [[sifaka]] tails are as long as their bodies. Their fur is long and mostly from whitish over reddish up to grey. Their black faces, however, are always bald. The hind legs are longer than their fore limbs, their hands are long and thin, and their thumbs cannot be opposed to the other fingers correctly.\n\nAll species are [[arboreal]], though they do come to the ground occasionally. When on the ground, they stand upright and move with short hops forward, with their arms held high. In the trees, though, they can make extraordinary leaps and are extremely agile, able to change direction from tree to tree. Like most leaf eaters, they adjust for the low nutrient content of their food by long rests. Often, they can be seen lying stretched on trees sunning themselves. Indriidae live together in family federations up to 15 animals, communicating with roars and facial expressions.\n\nIndriidae are [[herbivore]]s, eating mostly leaves, fruits, and flowers.

The stories originally appeared in the American magazines ''[[Super Science Stories]]'' and ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'' between 1940 and 1950 and were then compiled into a book for stand-alone publication by [[Gnome Press]] in 1950, in an initial edition of 5,000 copies.  The stories are woven together by a [[framing narrative]] in which the fictional Dr. [[Susan Calvin]] tells each story to a reporter (who serves as the narrator) in the 21st century.  Although the stories can be read separately, they share a theme of the interaction of humans, [[robot]]s, and [[morality]], and when combined they tell a larger story of Asimov's fictional history of [[robotics]].\n\nSeveral of the stories feature the character of Dr. Calvin, chief [[robopsychology|robopsychologist]] at [[U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men]], Inc., the major manufacturer of robots. Upon their publication in this collection, Asimov wrote a [[framing sequence]] presenting the stories as Calvin's reminiscences during an interview with her about her life's work, chiefly concerned with aberrant behaviour of robots and the use of \"[[robopsychology]]\" to sort out what is happening in their [[positronic brain]]. The book also contains the short story in which Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics]] first appear, which had large influence on later science fiction and had impact on thought on [[ethics of artificial intelligence]] as well. Other characters that appear in these short stories are [[Powell and Donovan]], a field-testing team which locates flaws in USRMM's prototype models.\n\nThe collection shares a title with the 1939 short story \"[[I, Robot (short story)|I, Robot]]\" by [[Eando Binder]] (pseudonym of Earl and [[Otto Binder]]), which greatly influenced Asimov. Asimov had wanted to call his collection ''Mind and Iron'', and initially objected when the publisher made the title the same as Binder's. In his introduction to the story in ''Isaac Asimov Presents the Great SF Stories'' (1979), Asimov wrote:\n{{quote|It certainly caught my attention. Two months after I read it, I began 'Robbie', about a sympathetic robot, and that was the start of my positronic robot series. Eleven years later, when nine of my robot stories were collected into a book, the publisher named the collection ''I, Robot'' over my objections. My book is now the more famous, but Otto's story was there first.}}\n\n==Contents==\n# \"Introduction\" (the initial portion of the framing story or linking text)\n# \"[[Robbie (short story)|Robbie]]\" (1940, 1950)\n# \"[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]\" (1942)\n# \"[[Reason (short story)|Reason]]\" (1941)\n# \"[[Catch That Rabbit]]\" (1944)\n# \"[[Liar!

The first was a 1962 episode of ''[[Out of This World (UK TV series)|Out of this World]]'' hosted by [[Boris Karloff]] called \"[[Little Lost Robot]]\" with [[Maxine Audley]] as [[Susan Calvin]]. Two short stories from the collection were made into episodes of ''[[Out of the Unknown]]'': \"The Prophet\" (1967), based on \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\"; and \"[[Liar!

The most notable attempt was one by [[Harlan Ellison]], who collaborated with Asimov himself to create a version which captured the spirit of the original. Asimov is quoted as saying that this screenplay would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile science fiction movie ever made.\"\n\nEllison's script builds a framework around Asimov's short stories that involves a reporter named Robert Bratenahl tracking down information about Susan Calvin's alleged former lover Stephen Byerly. Asimov's stories are presented as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s that differ from the originals in their stronger emphasis on Calvin's character. Ellison placed Calvin into stories in which she did not originally appear and fleshed out her character's role in ones where she did. In constructing the script as a series of flashbacks that focused on character development rather than action, Ellison used the film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' as a model.<ref name=\"WeeilWolf\">{{cite book |last=Weil |first=Ellen |author2=Wolfe, Gary K. |title=Harlan Ellison: The Edge of Forever |publisher=Ohio State University Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |page=126 |isbn=0-8142-0892-4}}</ref>\n\nAlthough acclaimed by critics, the screenplay is generally considered to have been unfilmable based upon the technology and average film budgets of the time.<ref name=\"WeeilWolf\" /> Asimov also believed that the film may have been scrapped because of a conflict between Ellison and the producers: when the producers suggested changes in the script, instead of being diplomatic as advised by Asimov, Ellison \"reacted violently\" and offended the producers.<ref>Isaac Asimov, \"Hollywood and I\". In ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'', May 1979.</ref> The script was serialized in ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'' magazine in late 1987, and eventually appeared in book form under the title ''I, Robot: The Illustrated Screenplay'', in 1994 (reprinted 2004, {{ISBN|1-4165-0600-4}}).\n\n====2004 film====\n{{main|I, Robot (film)}}\nThe film [[I, Robot (film)|''I, Robot'']], starring [[Will Smith]], was released by [[Twentieth Century Fox]] on July 16, 2004 in the United States. Its plot incorporates elements of \"[[Little Lost Robot]],\"<ref name=\"topel\"/> some of Asimov's character names and the ''Three Laws''. However, the plot of the movie is mostly original work adapted from a screenplay ''Hardwired'' by [[Jeff Vintar]] completely unlinked to Asimov's stories<ref name=\"topel\">{{cite web |last=Topel |first=Fred |title=\"Jeff Vintar was Hardwired for I,ROBOT\" (interview with Jeff Vintar, script writer) |work=Screenwriter's Utopia |publisher=Christopher Wehner |date=2004-08-17 |url=http://www.screenwritersutopia.com/article/d19127d8 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}</ref> and has been compared to Asimov's ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', which revolves around the murder of a roboticist (although the rest of the film's plot is not based on that novel or other works by Asimov).

One example of this is in the technology industry. The name of the real-life modem manufacturer named [[U.S. Robotics]] was directly inspired by ''I, Robot''.

The 1977 album ''[[I Robot (album)|I Robot]]'', by [[The Alan Parsons Project]], was inspired by Asimov's ''I, Robot''. In its original conception, the album was to follow the themes and concepts presented in the short story collection. The Alan Parsons Project were not able to obtain the rights in spite of Asimov's enthusiasm; he had already assigned the rights elsewhere.

The others are the [[secondary sector]] (approximately the same as [[manufacturing]]), and the [[primary sector]] ([[raw material]]s).\n\nThe service sector consists of the production of [[Service (economics)|services]] instead of [[Product (business)|end products]].  Services (also known as \"intangible goods\") include attention, advice, access, experience, and   [[affective labor]].  The [[information economy|production of information]] has long been regarded as a service, but some economists now attribute it to a fourth sector, the [[quaternary sector]].\n\nThe tertiary sector of industry involves the provision of services to other businesses as well as final consumers. Services may involve the [[transport]], [[distribution (economics)|distribution]] and sale of goods from producer to a consumer, as may happen in [[wholesaler|wholesaling]] and [[retailer|retailing]], [[pest control]] or [[entertainment]]. The goods may be transformed in the process of providing the service, as happens in the [[restaurant]] industry. However, the focus is on people interacting with people and serving the customer rather than transforming physical goods.\n\n[[File:Medical evacuation after car accident Kawartha Lakes Ontario.jpg|right|thumb|Ambulance service.]]\n[[File:Works Progress Administration maid poster edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Housemaid]]\n[[File:A working SBI employee.jpg|thumb|Banker at work]]\n\n== Difficulty of definition ==\n\nIt is sometimes hard to define whether a given company is part and parcel of the secondary or tertiary sector. And it is not only companies that have been classified as part of that sector in some schemes; government and its services such as police or military, and non-profit organizations such as charities or research associations can also be seen as part of that sector.<ref name=\"Lakhe2001\">{{cite book|author=R.P. Mohanty & R.R. Lakhe|title=TQM in the Service Sector|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASwLRRY6vIAC&pg=PT33|accessdate=1 May 2013|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7224-953-3|pages=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\nIn order to classify a business as a service, one can use classification systems such as the [[United Nations]]' [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] standard, the [[United States]]' [[Standard Industrial Classification]] (SIC) code system and its new replacement, the [[North American Industrial Classification System]] (NAICS), the [[Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community]] (NACE) in the EU and similar systems elsewhere. These governmental classification systems have a first-level hierarchy that reflects whether the economic goods are tangible or intangible.\n\nFor purposes of [[finance]] and [[market research]], [[Market (economics)|market]]-based classification systems such as the [[Global Industry Classification Standard]] and the [[Industry Classification Benchmark]] are used to classify businesses that participate in the service sector. Unlike governmental classification systems, the first level of market-based classification systems divides the economy into functionally related markets or industries. The second or third level of these hierarchies then reflects whether goods or services are produced.\n\n== Theory of progression ==\nFor the last 100 years, there has been a substantial shift from the primary and secondary sectors to the tertiary sector in industrialised countries. This shift is called '''tertiarisation'''.<ref name=eurofound>[http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/GREECE/TERTIARIZATION-GR.htm Definition by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720074155/http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/GREECE/TERTIARIZATION-GR.htm |date=July 20, 2014 }}</ref> The tertiary sector is now the largest sector of the economy in the [[Western world]], and is also the fastest-growing sector.\nIn examining the growth of the service sector in the early Nineties, the [[Globalism|globalist]] [[Kenichi Ohmae]] noted that:\n:\"In the United States 70 percent of the workforce works in the service sector; in Japan, 60 percent, and in Taiwan, 50 percent. These are not necessarily busboys and live-in maids. Many of them are in the professional category. They are earning as much as manufacturing workers, and often more.\u201d<ref>The Borderless World: Power and Strategy in the Interlinked Economy.</ref>\n\nEconomies tend to follow a developmental progression that takes them from a heavy reliance on agriculture and mining, toward the development of [[manufacturing]] (e.g. automobiles, textiles, shipbuilding, steel) and finally toward a more service-based structure. The first economy to follow this path in the modern world was the [[United Kingdom]]. The speed at which other economies have made the transition to service-based (or \"[[Post-industrial economy|post-industrial]]\") economies has increased over time.\n\nHistorically, manufacturing tended to be more open to [[international trade]] and competition than services. However, with dramatic cost reduction and speed and reliability improvements in the transportation of people and the communication of information, the service sector now includes some of the most intensive international competition, despite residual [[protectionism]].\n\n== Issues for service providers ==\n[[File:FirstIncision.JPG|thumb|Surgery team at work]]\n[[File:Risci\u00f2-in-avorio.jpg|thumb|Transport service]]\n[[File:Automatic Telephone Exchange- Communications in Wartime, London, England, UK, 1945 D23700.jpg|thumb|right|Testing telephone lines in [[London]] in 1945.]]\nService providers face obstacles selling services that goods-sellers rarely face.  Services are intangible, making it difficult for potential customers to understand what they will receive and what value it will hold for them. Indeed, some, such as [[consultants]] and providers of [[investment]] services, offer no guarantees of the value for price paid.\n\nSince the quality of most services depends largely on the quality of the individuals providing the services, \"people costs\" are usually a high fraction of service costs.

This sector is often divided into [[light industry]] and [[heavy industry]]. Many of these industries consume large quantities of energy and require factories and machinery to convert the raw materials into goods and products. They also produce [[waste]] materials and [[waste heat]] that may cause environmental problems or cause [[pollution]]. The secondary sector supports both the primary and [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]].\n\nSome economists contrast wealth-producing sectors in an economy such as manufacturing with the service sector which tends to be wealth-consuming.[1] Examples of service may include retail, insurance, and government. These economists contend that an economy begins to decline as its wealth-producing sector shrinks.[2] Manufacturing is an important activity to promote economic growth and development. Nations that export manufactured products tend to generate higher marginal GDP growth which supports higher incomes and marginal tax revenue needed to fund the quality of life initiatives such as health care and infrastructure in the economy. The field is an important source for engineering job opportunities. Among developed countries, it is an important source of well paying jobs for the middle class to facilitate greater social mobility for successive generations on the economy. \n\n{{Bar chart|float=center\n| title       = Largest countries by industrial output according to [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]], 2016\n| table_width = 70\n| bar_width   = 50 <!-- must be an unformatted number -->\n| data_max    = 5,000<!-- Upper bound on the values in the data fields -->\n| label_type  = Economy\n| data_type   = {{center|Countries by industrial output in 2016 (billions in [[United States dollar|USD]])}}\n| label1      = (01) '''{{CHN}}''' | data1 = 4,566\n| label2      = (\u2014) '''''{{EU}}''''' | data2 = 4,184\n| label3      = (02) '''{{USA}}''' | data3 = 3,602\n| label4      = (03) '''{{JPN}}''' | data4 = 1,368\n| label5      = (04) '''{{DEU}}''' | data5 = 1,050\n| label6      = (05) '''{{IND}}''' | data6 = 672\n| label7      = (06) '''{{KOR}}''' | data7 = 531\n| label8      = (07) '''{{GBR}}''' | data8 = 505\n| label9      = (08) '''{{FRA}}''' | data9 = 478\n| label10    = (09) '''{{ITA}}''' | data10 = 442\n| label11    = (10) '''{{RUS}}''' | data11 = 424\n| label12    = (11) '''{{CAN}}''' | data12 = 424\n| label13    = (12) '''{{BRA}}''' | data13 = 392\n| label14    = (13) '''{{IDN}}''' | data14 = 376\n| label15    = (14) '''{{AUS}}''' | data15 = 355\n| label16    = (15) '''{{MEX}}''' | data16 = 346\n| label17    = (16) '''{{ESP}}''' | data17 = 312\n| label18    = (17) '''{{SAU}}''' | data18 = 276\n| label19    = (18) '''{{TUR}}''' | data19 = 232\n| label20    = (19) '''{{TWN}}''' | data20 = 191\n| label21    = (20) '''{{POL}}''' | data21 = 180\n| caption = {{resize|88%|The twenty largest countries by industrial output in 2016, according to the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]].}}\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{empty section|date=September 2014}}\n\n[[Category:Industry]]\n[[Category:Economic sectors]]\n\n\n{{industry-stub}}", "sha1": "k66a9gu3zyawkod8mkpgt5t87yxuagh"}}, {"title": "Imaginary number", "ns": "0", "id": "14554", "revision": {"id": "866653346", "parentid": "865943497", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T17:46:40Z", "contributor": {"username": "JamesBWatson", "id": "1909773"}, "comment": "The linked article doesn't really contain any information relevant to imaginary numbers.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{redirect2|Imaginary Number|Imaginary numbers|the 2013 EP by The Maine|Imaginary Numbers (EP)}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n|{{math|...}} (repeats the pattern<br />from blue area)\n|-\n|{{math|1=''i''<sup>\u22123</sup> = ''i''}}\n|-\n|{{math|1=''i''<sup>\u22122</sup> = \u22121}}\n|-\n|{{math|1=''i''<sup>\u22121</sup> = \u2212''i''}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:#cedff2;\" | {{math|1=''i''<sup>0</sup> = 1}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:#cedff2;\" | {{math|1=''i''<sup>1</sup> = ''i''}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:#cedff2;\" | {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:#cedff2;\" | {{math|1=''i''<sup>3</sup> = \u2212''i''}}\n|-\n|{{math|1=''i''<sup>4</sup> = 1}}\n|-\n|{{math|1=''i''<sup>5</sup> = ''i''}}\n|-\n|{{math|1=''i''<sup>6</sup> = \u22121}}\n|-\n|{{math|1=''i''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''i''<sup>''n''([[Modular arithmetic|mod]] 4)</sup>}}\n|}\n\nAn '''imaginary number''' is a [[complex number]] that can be written as a [[real number]] multiplied by the [[imaginary unit]] {{mvar|i}},<ref group=note>''j'' is usually used in Engineering contexts where ''i'' has other meanings (such as electrical current)</ref> which is defined by its property {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}.<ref>{{cite book\n |title= Fundamentals of waves & oscillations\n |first= K.\n |last= Uno Ingard\n |publisher= Cambridge University Press\n |year= 1988\n |isbn= 0-521-33957-X\n |chapter= Chapter 2\n |page= 38\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SGVfGIewvxkC&pg=PA38}}\n</ref> The [[square (algebra)|square]] of an imaginary number {{mvar|bi}} is {{math|\u2212''b''<sup>2</sup>}}.

This idea first surfaced with the articles by [[James Cockle (lawyer)|James Cockle]] beginning in 1848.<ref>James Cockle (1848) \"On Certain Functions Resembling Quaternions and on a New Imaginary in Algebra\", London-Dublin-Edinburgh [[Philosophical Magazine]], series 3, 33:435&ndash;9 and Cockle (1849) \"On a New Imaginary in Algebra\", Philosophical Magazine 34:37\u201347</ref>\n\n==Geometric interpretation==\n[[File:Rotations on the complex plane.svg|thumb|90-degree rotations in the complex plane]]\n\nGeometrically, imaginary numbers are found on the vertical axis of the [[Complex plane|complex number plane]], allowing them to be presented [[perpendicular]] to the real axis. One way of viewing imaginary numbers is to consider a standard [[number line]], positively increasing in magnitude to the right, and negatively increasing in magnitude to the left. At 0 on this {{mvar|x}}-axis, a {{mvar|y}}-axis can be drawn with \"positive\" direction going up; \"positive\" imaginary numbers then increase in magnitude upwards, and \"negative\" imaginary numbers increase in magnitude downwards. This vertical axis is often called the \"imaginary axis\" and is denoted {{math|''i''\u211d}}, <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathbb{I}</math>, or {{math|\u2111}}.\n\nIn this representation, multiplication by&nbsp;{{math|\u20131}} corresponds to a [[rotation]] of 180 degrees about the origin. Multiplication by {{mvar|i}} corresponds to a 90-degree rotation in the \"positive\" direction (i.e., counterclockwise), and the equation {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}} is interpreted as saying that if we apply two 90-degree rotations about the origin, the net result is a single 180-degree rotation. Note that a 90-degree rotation in the \"negative\" direction (i.e. clockwise) also satisfies this interpretation. This reflects the fact that {{math|\u2212''i''}} also solves the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}. In general, multiplying by a complex number is the same as rotating around the origin by the complex number's [[Arg (mathematics)|argument]], followed by a scaling by its magnitude.\n\n==Square roots of negative numbers==\nCare must be used when working with imaginary numbers expressed as the [[principal value]]s of the [[square root]]s of negative numbers.

The requirement of an indictment has not been [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporated]] against the states; therefore, although the federal government uses grand juries and indictments, not all U.S. states do.<ref>{{cite court |litigants= [[Hurtado v. California]] |vol= 110 |reporter= U.S. |opinion= 516 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1884 |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/110/516/case.html |accessdate= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn many, but not all, [[United States]] jurisdictions that use grand juries, prosecutors often have a choice between seeking an indictment from a [[grand jury]] and filing a charging document directly with the court. Such a document is usually called an ''[[Information (formal criminal charge)|information]]'', ''accusation'', or ''complaint'', to distinguish it from a grand-jury indictment.  To protect the suspect's [[Due process|due-process]] rights in felony cases (where the suspect's interest in liberty is at stake), there is usually a [[preliminary hearing]], at which a judge determines whether there was probable cause to arrest the suspect who is in custody.  If the judge finds such probable cause, he or she binds, or holds over, the suspect for trial.\n\nThe substance of an indictment or other charging instrument is usually the same, regardless of the jurisdiction: it consists of a short and plain statement of where, when, and how the defendant allegedly committed the offense. Each offense usually is set out in a separate ''count''. Indictments for complex crimes, particularly those involving [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] or numerous counts, may run to hundreds of pages. However, in other cases an indictment for a crime as serious as [[murder]], may consist of a single sheet of paper.\n\nIndictable offenses are normally tried by [[jury]], unless the accused waives the right to a jury trial. Although the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] mandates the right to a jury trial in any criminal prosecution, the vast majority of criminal cases in the United States are resolved by the [[Plea bargain|plea-bargaining]] process.\n\n== Direct indictment (Canada) ==\nA direct indictment is one in which the case is sent directly to trial before a preliminary inquiry is completed or when the accused has been discharged by a preliminary inquiry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_XIX_1::bo-ga:l_XX//en?page=13&isPrinting=false#codese:577|title=Criminal Code, Revised Statutes of Canada 1985, c.

Saint Patrick is the only one commonly recognised as the patron saint. [[Saint Patrick's Day]] is celebrated on 17 March in Ireland and abroad as the Irish national day, with parades and other celebrations.\n\nAs with other predominantly Catholic European states, Ireland underwent a period of legal secularisation in the late twentieth century. In 1972, the article of the Constitution naming specific religious groups was deleted by the [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Fifth Amendment]] in a referendum. Article 44 remains in the Constitution: \"The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God.

Following the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] invasion in the 12th century, and gradual British conquest and colonisation beginning in the 16th century, Ireland became influenced by English and Scottish culture. Subsequently, Irish culture, though distinct in many aspects, shares characteristics with the [[Anglosphere]], [[Catholic Europe]], and other Celtic regions. The [[Irish diaspora]], one of the world's largest and most dispersed, has contributed to the globalisation of Irish culture, producing many prominent figures in art, music, and science.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Irish literature}}\n[[File:Jonathan Swift by Charles Jervas detail.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jonathan Swift]] (1667\u20131745)]]\nIreland has made a significant contribution to world literature in both the English and Irish languages. Modern [[Irish fiction]] began with the publishing of the 1726 novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]]. Other writers of importance during the 18th century and their most notable works include [[Laurence Sterne]] with the publication of ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' and [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]''. Numerous [[List of Irish novelists|Irish novelists]] emerged during the 19th century, including [[Maria Edgeworth]], [[John Banim]], [[Gerald Griffin]], [[Charles Kickham]], [[William Carleton]], [[George A. Moore|George Moore]], and [[Somerville and Ross]]. [[Bram Stoker]] is best known as the author of the 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]''.\n\n[[James Joyce]] (1882\u20131941) published his most famous work ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' in 1922, which is an interpretation of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' set in Dublin. [[Edith Anna Somerville|Edith Somerville]] continued writing after the death of her partner [[Violet Florence Martin|Martin Ross]] in 1915. Dublin's [[Annie M. P. Smithson]] was one of several authors catering for fans of romantic fiction in the 1920s and 1930s. After the Second World War, popular novels were published by, among others, Brian O'Nolan, who published as [[Flann O'Brien]], [[Elizabeth Bowen]], and [[Kate O'Brien (novelist)|Kate O'Brien]]. During the final decades of the 20th century, [[Edna O'Brien]], [[John McGahern]], [[Maeve Binchy]], [[Joseph O'Connor]], [[Roddy Doyle]], [[Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn]], and [[John Banville]] came to the fore as novelists.\n\n[[File:Yeats1923.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[W. B.

Well known Irish poets include [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[Thomas McCarthy (poet)|Thomas McCarthy]], [[Dermot Bolger]], and [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] laureates [[W. B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] (born in Northern Ireland but resided in Dublin). Prominent writers in the Irish language are [[P\u00e1draic \u00d3 Conaire]], [[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]], [[S\u00e9amus \u00d3 Grianna]], and [[Nuala N\u00ed Dhomhnaill]].\n\nThe history of [[Irish theatre]] begins with the expansion of the English administration in Dublin during the early 17th century, and since then, Ireland has significantly contributed to English drama. In its early history, theatrical productions in Ireland tended to serve political purposes, but as more theatres opened and the popular audience grew, a more diverse range of entertainments were staged. Many Dublin-based theatres developed links with their London equivalents, and British productions frequently found their way to the Irish stage. However, most Irish playwrights went abroad to establish themselves. In the 18th century, [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] were two of the most successful playwrights on the London stage at that time. At the beginning of the 20th century, theatre companies dedicated to the staging of Irish plays and the development of writers, directors and performers began to emerge, which allowed many Irish playwrights to learn their trade and establish their reputations in Ireland rather than in Britain or the United States. Following in the tradition of acclaimed practitioners, principally [[Oscar Wilde]], Literature Nobel Prize laureates [[George Bernard Shaw]] (1925) and [[Samuel Beckett]] (1969), playwrights such as [[Se\u00e1n O'Casey]], [[Brian Friel]], [[Sebastian Barry]], [[Brendan Behan]], [[Conor McPherson]] and [[Billy Roche]] have gained popular success.<ref>{{cite book|last =Houston|first =Eugenie|title =Working and Living in Ireland|publisher =Working and Living Publications|year =2001|isbn=0-9536896-8-9}}</ref> Other Irish playwrights of the 20th century include [[Denis Johnston]], [[Thomas Kilroy]], [[Tom Murphy (playwright)|Tom Murphy]], [[Hugh Leonard]], [[Frank McGuinness]], and [[John B. Keane]].\n\n===Music and dance===\n{{Main|Irish music|Irish dance}}\n[[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]] has remained vibrant, despite globalising cultural forces, and retains many traditional aspects. It has influenced various music genres, such as American country and roots music, and to some extent modern rock. It has occasionally been blended with styles such as rock and roll and punk rock. Ireland has also produced many internationally known artists in other genres, such as rock, pop, jazz, and blues. Ireland's best selling musical act is the rock band [[U2]], who have sold 170 million copies of their albums worldwide since their formation in 1976.<ref name=\"170sales\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/u2-what-theyre-still-looking-for/3/|title=U2: What they're still looking for|work=[[CBS News]]|first=Anthony|last=Mason|date=24 May 2015|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:U2 on Joshua Tree Tour 2017 Brussels 8-1-17.jpg|thumb|right|Dublin-based rock group [[U2]].]]\n\nThere are a number of classical music ensembles around the country, such as the [[RT\u00c9 Performing Groups]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmc.ie/links/index.html |title=Contemporary Music Ireland |publisher=Contemporary Music Centre \u2013 Links |accessdate=9 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224073202/http://www.cmc.ie/links/index.html |archivedate=24 February 2009 |df= }}</ref> Ireland also has three opera organisations.

Irish social dance can be divided into ''c\u00e9il\u00ed'' and set dancing. Irish [[set dance]]s are [[quadrilles]], danced by 4 couples arranged in a square, while [[Ceili dance|c\u00e9il\u00ed dances]] are danced by varied [[Formation dance|formations]] of couples of 2 to 16 people. There are also many stylistic differences between these two forms. Irish social dance is a living tradition, and variations in particular dances are found across the country. In some places dances are deliberately modified and new dances are choreographed. Performance dance is traditionally referred to as [[step dance|stepdance]]. [[Irish stepdance]], popularised by the show ''[[Riverdance]]'', is notable for its rapid leg movements, with the body and arms being kept largely stationary. The solo stepdance is generally characterised by a controlled but not rigid upper body, straight arms, and quick, precise movements of the feet. The solo dances can either be in \"soft shoe\" or \"hard shoe\".\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of Ireland}}\n[[File:Monasterboice North Church and West Cross West Face 2013 09 27.jpg|thumb|left|The ruins of [[Monasterboice]] in [[County Louth]] are of early Christian settlement.]]\n\nIreland has a wealth of structures,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithomania.com/|publisher=Megalithomania|title=The Megalithic Monuments of Ireland|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> surviving in various states of preservation, from the [[Neolithic]] period, such as ''[[Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne]]'', [[Poulnabrone dolmen]], [[Castlestrange stone]], [[Turoe stone]], and [[Drombeg stone circle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://goireland.about.com/od/historyculture/qt/prehistoric.htm|publisher=About.com|title=The Prehistoric Monuments of Ireland|accessdate=19 October 2009}}</ref> As the Romans never conquered Ireland, architecture of [[Greco-Roman]] origin is extremely rare.

This is more than the population of Ireland at its historical peak in the 1840s of 8.5 million. The poorest of them went to Great Britain, especially [[Liverpool]]; those who could afford it went further, including almost 5 million to the United States.<ref>[[J.

Family and friends of emigrants would accompany them as far as the bridge before saying goodbye, while the emigrants would continue on to [[Derry Port]].]]\nThe term Irish diaspora is open to many interpretations. The [[diaspora]], broadly interpreted, contains all those known to have Irish ancestors, i.e., over 100 million people, which is more than fifteen times the population of the island of [[Ireland]], which was about 6.4 million in 2011. It has been argued the idea of an Irish diaspora, as distinct from the old identification of Irishness with Ireland itself, was influenced by the perceived advent of global mobility and modernity. Irishness could now be identified with dispersed individuals and groups of Irish descent. But many of those individuals were the product of complex ethnic intermarriage in America and elsewhere, complicating the idea of a single line of descent. \"Irishness\" might then rely primarily on individual identification with an Irish diaspora.<ref>Nash, Catherine (2008), ''Of Irish Descent: Origin Stories, Genealogy, and the Politics of Belonging'', Syracuse University Press, pp. 33\u201350. {{ISBN|9780815631590}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Government of Ireland]] defines the Irish diaspora as all persons of [[Irish nationality]] who habitually reside outside of the island of Ireland. This includes Irish citizens who have emigrated abroad and their children, who are Irish citizens by descent under [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Irish law]]. It also includes their grandchildren in cases where they were registered as Irish citizens in the [[Foreign Births Register]] held in every [[Irish diplomatic missions|Irish diplomatic mission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/moving-country/irish-citizenship/irish_citizenship_through_birth_or_descent|title=Irish Citizens Information Board|website=Citizensinformation.ie|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref> Under this legal definition, the Irish diaspora is considerably smaller\u2014some 3 million persons, of whom 1.2 million are Irish-born emigrants. This is still a large ratio for any country.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n[[File:Road from Falcarragh SE to R251 - Stone monument - geograph.org.uk - 1185262.jpg|270px|thumb|A plaque commemorating ''The Bridge of Tears'', which reads, ''\"Fad leis seo a thagadh cairde agus lucht gaoil an t\u00e9 a bh\u00ed ag imeacht chun na coigrithe. B'anseo an scaradh. Seo Droichead na nDeor\"'' (Family and friends of the person leaving for foreign lands would come this far. Here was the separation. This is the Bridge of Tears).]]\nHowever, the usage of ''Irish diaspora'' is generally not limited by citizenship status, thus leading to an estimated (and fluctuating) membership of up to 80 million persons\u2014the second and more emotive definition. The Irish Government acknowledged this interpretation\u2014although it did not acknowledge any legal obligations to persons in this larger diaspora\u2014when Article 2 of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was amended in 1998 to read ''\"[f]urthermore, the Irish nation cherishes its special affinity with people of Irish ancestry living abroad who share its cultural identity and heritage.\"''\n\nThe right to register as an Irish citizen terminates at the third generation (except as noted above). This contrasts with citizenship law in [[Italian nationality law|Italy]], [[Law of Return|Israel]], Japan and other countries which practice [[jus sanguinis]] or otherwise permit members of the diaspora to register as citizens.\n\nThere are people of Irish descent abroad (including [[Irish language|Irish speakers]]) who reject inclusion in an Irish \"diaspora\" and who designate their identity in other ways. They may see the diasporic label as something used by the Irish government for its own purposes.<ref>{{cite web|title='Diasp\u00f3ra \u00e9igin,' ''An L\u00faib\u00edn''|date=22 May 2015|url=http://www.gaeilgesanastrail.com/newsletter-ir.php|quotation=\"Os a choinne sin, tig le daoine \u00e1irithe a r\u00e1 gur de shliocht \u00c9ireannach iad ach nach daoine d'aon Diasp\u00f3ra iad.

The [[Attacotti]], who were similarly recruited into the Roman army, may also have been Irish settlers in Britain (the movement between Ireland and the classical Britain may have been two-way as similarities between the Medieval accounts of [[T\u00faathal Techtmar#Romans in Ireland?g|T\u00faathal Teachtmar]] and archaeological evidence indicate that the Romans may have supported the invasion and conquest of Ireland by Irish exiles from Britain with the hopes of establishing a friendly ruler who could halt the raiding of Britain by the Irish. Some historians have also suggested that the [[Cruthin]] of the North of Ireland may have been [[Picts]].).<ref>''Tuathal Techtmar: A Myth or Ancient Literary Evidence for a Roman Invasion?'' By R. 8. Warner, The [[Ulster Museum]].</ref> Following the withdrawal of the Roman army, the Irish began increasing their footholds in Britain, with part of the north-West of the island annexed within the Irish kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]]. In time, the Irish colonies became independent, merged with the [[Pict]]ish kingdom, and formed the basis of modern [[Scotland]].\n\nThe traditionally [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking areas of Scotland (the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands and Hebrides]]) are still referred to in the Gaelic language as ''a' Gh\u00e0idhealtachd'' (\"''the Gaeldom''\"). Irish monks, and the [[Celtic church]], pioneered a wave of Irish emigration into Great Britain, and continental Europe (and they were possibly the first inhabitants of the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Iceland]]).<ref>The 9th-century Irish monk and geographer [[Dicuil]] describes Iceland in his work [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Dicuil/De_mensura_orbis_terrae/text*.html ''Liber de Mensura Orbis Terrae''].</ref> Throughout early Medieval times Britain and continental Europe experienced Irish immigration of varying intensity, mostly from clerics and scholars who are collectively known as ''peregrini''.<ref name=\"On Google Books\"/> Irish emigration to western Europe, and especially to Great Britain, has continued at a greater or lesser pace since then. Today, the ethnic-Irish are the single largest minority group in both England and Scotland, most of whom eventually made it back to Ireland.\n\nThe dispersal of the Irish has been mainly to Britain or to countries colonised by Britain. England's political connection with Ireland began in 1155 when [[Pope Adrian IV]] issued a [[papal bull]] (known as ''[[Laudabiliter]]'') that gave [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] permission to invade Ireland as a means of strengthening the Papacy's control over the [[Celtic Christian|Irish Church]]. This was followed in 1169 by the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] led by the general [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]], a.k.a. ''Strongbow''.\n\nThe English Crown did not attempt to assert full control of the island until after [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s repudiation of [[Papacy|paprebelal]] authority over the [[Church in England]] and subsequent rebellion of the [[Earl of Kildare]] in Ireland in 1534 threatened English [[hegemony]] there. Until the break with [[Holy See|Rome]], it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere [[fiefdom]] to the English king, so in 1541 Henry VIII asserted England's claim to Ireland free from the Papal overlordship by proclaiming himself [[King of Ireland]].\n\nFollowing the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594 to 1603) political power rested in the hands of a [[Protestant Ascendancy]] minority and was marked by a Crown policy of [[Plantations of Ireland|plantation]], involving the arrival of thousands of English and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Protestant]] settlers, and the consequent displacement of the pre-plantation [[Catholicism in Ireland|Roman Catholic]] landholders. As the military and political defeat of [[Gaelic Ireland]] became more pronounced in the early seventeenth century, [[sectarian]] conflict became a recurrent theme in Irish history.\n\nRoman Catholics and members of [[Nonconformism|dissenting]] Protestant denominations suffered severe political and economic privations from [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]]. The [[Irish House of Commons|Irish Parliament]] was abolished in 1801 in the wake of the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|United Irishmen Rebellion]] and Ireland became an integral part of a new [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] under the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]].\n\nThe [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine of Ireland]] during the 1840s saw a significant number of people flee from the island to all over the world. Between 1841 and 1851 as a result of death and mass emigration (mainly to Great Britain and North America) Ireland's population fell by over 2 million. In [[Connacht]] alone the population fell by almost 30%.\n\n[[Robert E. Kennedy (University president)|Robert E. Kennedy]] explains, however, that the common argument of the mass emigration from Ireland being a \"flight from famine\" is not entirely correct: firstly, the Irish had been coming to build canals in Great Britain since the 18th century, and once conditions were better emigration did not slow down. After the famine was over the four following years produced more emigrants than during the four years of the blight. Kennedy argues that the famine was considered the final straw to convince people to move and that there were several other factors in the decision making.\n\nBy 1900 the population of Ireland was about half of its 1840 high and continued to fall during the 20th century.\n\nIrish people at home were facing discrimination from Great Britain based on the former's religion. Evictions only increased after the repeal of the British [[Corn Laws]] in 1846 and the new [[Encumbered Estates' Court|Encumbered Estates]] Act being passed in 1849 as well as the removal of existing civil rights. There had been agrarian terrorism against landlords which these new laws were implemented to stop the retribution. Any hope for change was squashed with the death of [[Daniel O'Connell]] in 1847, the political leader championing for Ireland, and the failed rising of the [[Young Ireland]]ers in 1848. More was to be gained by immigrating to America from Ireland and the [[California Gold Rush|1848 discovery of gold]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] lured away more.<ref>Kennedy, Robert E.

It is estimated that as many as six million people living in the UK have an Irish-born grandparent (around 10% of the UK population).<ref name=accordingtotheGuardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/13/britishidentity.travelnews|title=More Britons applying for Irish passports|first1=Owen|last1=Bowcott|first2=Ireland|last2=correspondent|date=13 September 2006|accessdate=11 January 2018|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2001 UK Census]] states that 869,093 people born in Ireland are living in Great Britain.\nMore than 10% of those born in the United Kingdom have at least one grandparent born in Ireland.<ref name=\"guardian-2006\" /> The article \"More Britons applying for Irish passports\" states that 6 million Britons have either an Irish grandfather or grandmother and are thus able to apply for Irish citizenship.<ref name=\"guardian-2006\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/britain/article/0,,1871753,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Owen | last=Bowcott | title=More Britons applying for Irish passports | date=13 September 2006}}</ref> Almost a quarter claimed some Irish ancestry in one survey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1224611.stm|title=One in four Britons claim Irish roots|date=16 March 2001|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Irish have traditionally been involved in the building trade and transport particularly as dockers, following an influx of Irish workers, or [[navvies]], to build the British canal, road and rail networks in the 19th century. This is largely due to the flow of [[emigrants]] from Ireland during [[Great Famine (Ireland)|the Great Famine]] of 1845\u20131849. Many Irish servicemen, particularly sailors, settled in Britain: During the 18th and 19th century a third of the Army and Royal Navy were Irish. The Irish still represent the largest contingent of foreign volunteers to the British military, with more Irishmen serving in British uniforms than Irish ones.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Since the 1950s and 1960s in particular, the Irish have become assimilated into the British population. Emigration continued into the next century; over half a million Irish went to Britain in World War II to work in industry and serve in the [[British armed forces]]. In the post-war reconstruction era, the numbers of immigrants began to increase, many settling in the larger cities and towns of Britain. According to the 2001 census, around 850,000 people in Britain were born in Ireland.\n\nThe largest Irish communities in Britain are located predominantly in the cities and towns: in London, in particular [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] (which has one of the largest Irish-born communities outside Ireland) out to the west and north west of the city, in the large port cities such as [[Liverpool]] (which elected the first Irish Nationalist members of parliament), [[Glasgow]], [[Bristol]], [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] and [[Portsmouth]]. Big industrial cities such as [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Manchester]], [[Luton]], [[Coventry]], [[Birmingham]], [[Sheffield]], [[Wolverhampton]], [[Cardiff]] and parts of [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Nottingham]] also have large diaspora populations due to the Industrial Revolution and, in the case of the first three, the strength of the motor industry in the 1960s and 1970s.

In Edinburgh [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] were founded in 1875 and in 1909 another club with Irish links, [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], was formed.

[[Brioc|Saint Brieuc]] founded the city that bears his name in [[Brittany]], [[Columbanus|Saint Colm\u00e1n]] founded the great monastery of [[Bobbio]] in northern Italy and one of his monks was [[Saint Gall]] for whom the Swiss town of [[St. Gallen|St Gallen]] and [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Canton of St. Gallen|St Gallen]] are named.\n\nDuring the [[Counter-Reformation]], Irish religious and political links with Europe became stronger. An important centre of learning and training for Irish priests developed in [[Leuven]] (L\u00fabhan in Irish and ''Louvain'' historically in English) in the [[Duchy of Brabant]], now in [[Flanders]] (northern Belgium). The [[Flight of the Earls]], in 1607, led much of the Gaelic nobility to flee the country, and after the wars of the 17th century many others fled to Spain, France, Austria, and other Roman Catholic lands. The lords and their retainers and supporters joined the armies of these countries, and were known as the [[Flight of the Wild Geese|Wild Geese]]. Some of the lords and their descendants rose to high ranks in their adoptive countries, such as the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] general and politician [[Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetuan]], who became the [[president of the Government of Spain]] or the [[French people|French]] general and politician [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Duke of Magenta]], who became the [[president of the French Republic]]. The French [[Cognac]] [[brandy]] maker, [[Hennessy|James Hennessy and Co.]], is named for an Irishman. In Spain and its territories, many Irish descendants can be found with the name ''Obreg\u00f3n'' (''O'Brien'', [[Irish language|Irish]], ''\u00d3 Briain''), including Madrid-born actress ''Ana Victoria Garc\u00eda Obreg\u00f3n''.\n\nDuring the 20th century, certain Irish intellectuals made their homes in continental Europe, particularly [[James Joyce]], and later [[Samuel Beckett]] (who became a courier for the [[French Resistance]]). [[Eoin O'Duffy]] led a brigade of 700 Irish volunteers to fight for [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], and Frank Ryan led the Connolly column who fought on the opposite side, with the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] [[International Brigades]]. [[William Joyce]] became an [[English language|English-language]] propagandist for the [[Third Reich]], known colloquially as [[Lord Haw-Haw]].\n\n==Americas==\n\nWith its newly established trans-Atlantic empire, England needed labour. After the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], the Kingdom of England began to pacify Ireland through [[ethnic cleansing]], transporting large numbers of Irish, often forced into indentured servitude, to the New World. This increased following the [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131651) and the [[Cromwellian invasion of Ireland]] (1649\u20131653). [[Cromwell]] took Irish land both to repay investors who had financed the invasion and as payment for his soldiers, and the ethnic Irish were ordered to move to [[Connaught]] or die. Between 1641 and 1652, over 550,000 Irish died from famine and other war-related causes. The Irish population of Ireland fell from 1,466,000 to 616,000. Between 1652 and 1659, 50,000 Irish men, women and children were sent to the West Indies, Virginia and Bermuda.\n\n===Argentina===\n{{Main|Irish settlement in Argentina}}\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, over 38,000 Irish immigrated to [[Argentina]].<ref name=\"Argentina\">{{cite web |url=http://www.westernpeople.ie/news/story.asp?j=36054 |title=Flying the Irish flag in Argentina |publisher=[[Western People]] |date=14 March 2008 |accessdate=4 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014183725/http://westernpeople.ie/news/story.asp?j=36054 |archive-date=14 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Very distinct Irish communities and schools existed until the Per\u00f3n era in the 1950s.\n\nToday there are an estimated 1,000,000 people of Irish ancestry in Argentina,<ref name=\"Argentina\"/> approximately 15.5% of the Republic of Ireland's current population; however, these numbers may be far higher, given that many Irish newcomers declared themselves to be British, as Ireland at the time was still part of the United Kingdom and today their descendants integrated into Argentine society with mixed bloodlines.\n\nDespite the fact that Argentina was never the main destination for Irish emigrants it does form part of the Irish diaspora. The Irish-Argentine [[William Bulfin]] remarked as he travelled around Westmeath in the early 20th century that he came across many locals who had been to Buenos Aires.

This was meant to pacify Ireland, easing English rule, and to clear land for settlement by English soldiers. The Puritan English government officials also expressed the opinion that they were saving the souls of the Roman Catholic Irish by settling them in Protestant territories where they would inevitably be converted to the true faith. Smaller numbers of Scottish prisoners were also sent to Bermuda following Cromwell's invasion of Scotland.\n\nRelations between the involuntary Irish immigrants and the local English population were strained. The Irish and Scots were ostracised by the English, ultimately intermarrying with Black and Native American minority groups to create a single demographic (''coloured'', which in Bermuda included anyone not able to be described as wholly of European ancestry. Today, the term has been replaced by ''Black'', in which wholly sub-Saharan African ancestry is erroneously implicit). The Irish quickly proved troublesome, and Bermudian slave owners were instructed ''that those that hath the Irish servants should take care that they straggle not night nor day as is too common with them''. In 1658, three Irishmen \u2013 John Shehan, David Laragen and Edmund Malony \u2013 were lashed for breaking [[curfew]] and being suspected of stealing a boat.

Little survived of the non-English cultures. Catholicism was outlawed in Bermuda, as with the rest of English territory, and all islanders were required by law to attend services of the established [[Church of England]]. Some surnames that were common in Bermuda at this period, however, give lingering evidence of the Irish presence. By example, the area to the east of Bailey's Bay, in Hamilton Parish, is named ''Callan Glen'' for a Scottish-born shipwright, ''Claude MacCallan'', who settled in Bermuda after the vessel in which he was a passenger was wrecked off the North Shore in 1787. MacCallan swam to a rock from which he was rescued by a Bailey's Bay fisherman named ''Daniel Seon'' (''Sheehan''). A later Daniel Seon was appointed Clerk of the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]] and Prothonotary of the Court of General Assize in 1889 (he was also the Registrar of the Supreme Court, and died in 1909).\n\nIn 1803, Irish poet [[Thomas Moore]] arrived in Bermuda, having been appointed registrar to the [[Admiralty]] there. Robert Kennedy, born in [[Cultra]], [[County Down]], was the [[Government of Bermuda]]'s ''Colonial Secretary'', and was the acting [[Governor of Bermuda]] on three occasions (1829, 1830 and 1835\u20131836).<ref>Gentleman's Magazine. See ''American Vital Records from the Gentleman's Magazine, 1731-1868'', by David Dobson, Page 160.</ref> Irish prisoners were again sent to Bermuda in the 19th century, including participants in the ill-fated [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848]] and Nationalist journalist and politician [[John Mitchel]]. Alongside English convicts, they were used to build the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] on Ireland Island.<ref>[http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d7219230030099&sectionId=126 British military presence in Bermuda]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]'', 3 February 2007</ref> Conditions for the convicts were harsh, and discipline was draconian. In April, 1830, convict James Ryan was shot and killed during rioting of convicts on Ireland Island. Another five convicts were given death sentences for their parts in the riots, with those of the youngest three being commuted to transportation (to [[Australia]]) for life. In June, 1849, convict James [[Cronin]], on the hulk [[HMS Medway (1812)|Medway]] at Ireland Island, was placed in solitary confinement from the 25th to the 29th for fighting. On release, and being returned to work, he refused to be cross-ironed. He ran onto the breakwater, brandishing a poker threateningly. For this, he was ordered to receive punishment (presumably flogging) on Tuesday, 3 July 1849, with the other convicts aboard the hulk assembled behind a rail to witness. When ordered to strip, he hesitated. Thomas Cronin, his older brother, addressed him and, while brandishing a knife, rushed forward to the separating rail. He called out to the other prisoners in [[Irish language|Irish]] and many joined him in attempting to free the prisoner and attack the officers. The officers opened fire. Two men were killed and twelve wounded. Punishment of James Cronin was then carried out. Three-hundred men of the [[42nd Regiment of Foot]], in barracks on Ireland Island, responded to the scene under arms.<ref>''Bermuda Sampler 1815-1850'', by William Zuill.

As the most important British naval and military base in the Western Hemisphere following US independence, large numbers of Irish Roman Catholic soldiers served in the British Army's [[Bermuda Garrison]] (the Royal Navy had also benefitted from a shipload of Irish emigres wrecked on Bermuda, with most being recruited into the navy there). The first Roman Catholic services in Bermuda were conducted by British Army chaplains early in the 19th Century. Mount Saint Agnes Academy, a private school operated by the Roman Catholic Church of Bermuda, opened in 1890 at the behest of officers of the [[86th (Royal County Down) Regiment of Foot]] (which was posted to Bermuda from 1880 to 1883), who had requested from the [[Archbishop]] of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], a school for the children of Irish Roman Catholic soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bermuda-online.org/britarmy.htm|title=British Army in Bermuda from 1701 to 1977|first=Keith Archibald|last=Forbes|website=bermuda-online.org|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msa.bm/index.php/about-us/2011-05-06-15-24-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821052104/http://www.msa.bm/index.php/about-us/2011-05-06-15-24-05|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 August 2013|title=Mount St. Agnes Academy website: History|website=Msa.bm|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nNot all Irish soldiers in Bermuda had happy lives there. Private Joseph McDaniel of the [[30th Regiment of Foot]] (who was born in the [[East Indies]] to an Irish father and a [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] mother) was convicted of the murder of Mary Swears in June, 1837, after he had been found with a self-inflicted wound and her lifeless body. Although he maintained his innocence throughout the trial, after his conviction he confessed that they had made a pact to die together. Although he had succeeded in killing her, he had failed to kill himself. He was put to death on Wednesday, 29 November 1837. Private Patrick Shea of the [[20th Regiment of Foot]] was sentenced to death in June, 1846, for discharging his weapon at Sergeant John Evans. His sentence was commuted to transportation (to [[Australia]]) for life. In October, 1841, [[County Carlow, Ireland|County Carlow]]-born Peter Doyle had also been transported to Australia for fourteen years for shooting at a picket.

Several prominent businesses in Bermuda have a clear Irish influence, such as the Irish Linen Shop, Tom Moore's Tavern and Flanagan's Irish Pub and Restaurant.\n\nA succession of Irish [[Masonic lodge]]s have existed in Bermuda, beginning with ''Military Lodge #192'', established by soldiers of the [[47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot|47th Regiment of Foot]], and operating in Bermuda from 1793 to 1801. This was an ambulatory or traveling lodge, as with other military lodges, moving with its members. Irish Lodges #220 (also a military travelling lodge) was active in Bermuda from 1856 to 1861, and Irish Lodge #209 was established in Bermuda in 1881. Minder Lodge #63 of the Irish Constitution was in Bermuda with the 20th Regiment of Foot from 1841 to 1847. The Hannibal Lodge #224 of the Irish Constitution was warranted in 1867, and still exists, meeting in the Masonic Hall on Old Maid's Lane, [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]].

It is estimated that about 80% of Newfoundlanders have Irish ancestry on at least one side of their family tree. The family names, the predominant Roman Catholic religion, the prevalence of Irish music \u2013 even the accents of the people \u2013 are so reminiscent of rural Ireland that Irish author [[Tim Pat Coogan]] has described Newfoundland as ''\"the most Irish place in the world outside Ireland\"''.<ref name=\"Wherever Green Is Worn\">[[Tim Pat Coogan]], \"Wherever Green Is Worn: The Story of the Irish Diaspora\", Palgrave Macmillan, 2002.</ref> [[Newfoundland Irish]], the dialect of the [[Irish language]] specific to the island was widely spoken until the mid-20th century. It is very similar to the language heard in the southeast of Ireland centuries ago, due to mass emigration from the counties [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]], [[Waterford]], [[Wexford]], [[County Kerry]] and [[County Cork|Cork]].\n\n[[Saint John, New Brunswick]], claims the distinction of being Canada's most Irish city, according to census records. There have been Irish settlers in [[New Brunswick]] since at least the late 18th century, but during the peak of the [[Great Irish Famine]] (1845\u20131847), thousands of Irish emigrated through Partridge Island in the port of Saint John. Most of these Irish were Roman Catholic, who changed the complexion of the Loyalist city. A large, vibrant Irish community can also be found in the [[Miramichi Valley|Miramichi]] region of [[New Brunswick]].\n\n[[Guysborough County]], Nova Scotia has many rural Irish villages. Erinville (which means Irishville), Salmon River, Ogden, Bantry (named after [[Bantry Bay]], [[County Cork]], Ireland but now abandoned and grown up in trees) among others, where Irish last names are prevalent and the accent is reminiscent of the [[Irish people|Irish]] as well as the music, traditions, religion ([[Roman Catholic]]), and the love of Ireland itself. Some of the Irish counties from which these people arrived were [[County Kerry]] ([[Dingle Peninsula]]), [[County Cork]], and [[County Roscommon]], along with others.\n\nIn [[Antigonish County]], next to [[Guysborough County]] in Nova Scotia there are a few rural Irish villages despite the predominance of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] in most of that County. Some of these villages names are Ireland, Lochaber and Cloverville. [[Antigonish]] Town is a fairly even mix of Irish and Scottish, and the Irish presence contributes to Nova Scotia's [[Celts|Celtic]] cultural character. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n[[Quebec]] is also home to a large Irish community, especially in [[Montreal]], where the Irish [[shamrock]] is featured on the [[flag of Montreal|municipal flag]]. This is not a sign of homage to the Irish but of the conquest of French speaking Qu\u00e9bec by British who use the symbols of France, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland bounded within the English [[St George's Cross|cross of St. George]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Notably, thousands of Irish emigrants during the Famine passed through [[Grosse Isle]] near Qu\u00e9bec City, where many succumbed to [[typhus]]. Most of the Irish who settled near Qu\u00e9bec City are now French speakers.\n\n[[Ontario]] has over 2 million people of Irish descent, who in greater numbers arrived in the 1820s and the decades that followed to work on colonial infrastructure and to settle land tracts in Upper Canada, the result today is a countryside speckled with the place names of Ireland. Ontario received a large number of those who landed in Quebec during the Famine years, many thousands died in Ontario's ports. Irish-born became the majority in [[Toronto]] by 1851.\n\n===Caribbean===\nFrom the 1620s, many of the Irish Roman Catholic merchant class in this period migrated voluntarily to the West Indies to avail of the business opportunities there occasioned by the trade in sugar, tobacco and cotton. They were followed by landless Irish indentured labourers, who were recruited to serve a landowner for a specified time before receiving freedom and land. The descendants of some Irish immigrants are known today in the West Indies as [[redlegs]]. Most descendants of these Irishmen moved off the islands as [[African slavery]] was implemented and blacks began to replace whites.

One of the most important industries of the island was the sugar industry. Among the successful businessmen in this industry were Miguel Conway, who owned a plantation in the town of [[Hatillo, Puerto Rico|Hatillo]] and Juan Nagle whose plantation was located in [[R\u00edo Piedras]]. General [[Alexander O'Reilly]], \"Father of the Puerto Rican Militia\", named Tomas O'Daly chief engineer of modernising the defences of San Juan, this included the fortress of [[Fort San Crist\u00f3bal (Puerto Rico)|San Crist\u00f3bal]].<ref name = \"Irish\"/> Tomas O'Daly and Miguel Kirwan were partners in the \"Hacienda San Patricio\", which they named after the [[patron saint]] of Ireland, [[Saint Patrick]]. A relative of O'Daly, [[Demetrio O'Daly]], succeeded Captain [[Ramon Power y Giralt]] as the island's delegate to the Spanish Courts. The plantation no longer exists, however the land in which the plantation was located is now a San Patricio suburb with a shopping mall by the same name.

[[Bernardo O'Higgins]] was the first [[President of Chile|Supreme director]] of [[Chile]]. When Chilean troops occupied [[Lima]] during the War of the Pacific in 1881, they put in charge certain [[Patricio Lynch]], whose grandfather came from Ireland to Argentina and then moved to Chile.

Many communities also existed in [[Mexican Texas]] until the [[Texas Revolution|revolution]] there, when they sided with Roman Catholic Mexico against Protestant pro-US elements. The ''[[Saint Patrick's Battalion|Batall\u00f3n de San Patricio]]'', a battalion of US troops who deserted and fought alongside the [[Mexican Army]] against the United States in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] of 1846\u20131848, is well known in [[History of Mexico|Mexican history]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n[[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]] (possibly O'Brian or O'Brien){{citation needed|date=February 2018}} was [[List of Presidents of Mexico|president of Mexico]] during 1920\u201324 and [[Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n|Obreg\u00f3n city]] and [[Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n International Airport|airport]] are named in his honour. Mexico also has a large number of people of Irish ancestry, among them the actor [[Anthony Quinn]]. There are monuments in Mexico City paying tribute to those Irish who fought for Mexico in the 19th century. There is a monument to Los Patricios in the fort of Churubusco. During the Potato Famine, thousands of Irish immigrants entered the country. Other Mexicans of Irish descent are: [[Romulo O'Farril]], [[Juan O'Gorman]], [[Edmundo O'Gorman]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Alejo Bay]] (Governor of the state of [[Sonora]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Irish Americans}}\n\nThe diaspora to the United States was immortalised in the words of many songs including the famous Irish [[ballad]], \"The Green Fields of America\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nSo pack up your sea-stores, consider no longer,\nTen dollars a week is not very bad pay,\nWith no taxes or tithes to devour up your wages,\nWhen you're on the green fields of Americay.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe experience of Irish immigrants in the United States has not always been harmonious. The US did not have a good relationship with most of the incoming Irish because of their Roman Catholic faith, as the majority of the population was Protestant and had been originally formed by offshoots of the Protestant faith, many of whom were from Northern Ireland (Ulster).<ref>Patricia I.

In modern times, in the United States, the Irish are largely perceived as hard workers. Most notably they are associated with the positions of police officer, [[firefighter]], [[Roman Catholic Church]] leaders and politicians in the larger [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] metropolitan areas. Irish Americans number over 35 million, making them the second largest reported ethnic group in the country, after [[German American]]s.

Half of these Irish Americans were descended from Ulster people, and half were descended from the people of Connacht, Leinster and Munster.\n\nAccording to US Census figures from 2000, 41,000,000 Americans claim to be wholly or partly of Irish ancestry, a group that represents more than one in five white Americans.

While most of the early Irish came as traders, some also came as soldiers. However, the majority of these traders and soldiers were from the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. Prominent among them were the generals [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] (1769\u20131852) who became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in 1834 and his brother [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]] (1760\u20131842), who was [[Governor-General of India]] (1798\u20131805) and a great-great-great grandfather of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. Later in the Victorian period, many thinkers, philosophers and Irish nationalists from the Roman Catholic majority too made it to India, prominent among the nationalists being the theosophist [[Annie Besant]].\n\nIt is widely believed that there existed a secret alliance between the Irish and Indian independence movements. Some Indian intellectuals like [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[V. V. Giri]] were certainly inspired by Irish nationalists when they studied in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Indian revolutionary group known as the [[Bengal Volunteers]] took this name in emulation of the [[Irish Volunteers]].\n\n*[[Derek O'Brien (quizmaster)|Derek O'Brien]], quiz master turned MP in Indian state of [[West Bengal]].\n*[[Michael John O'Brian]] is an eminent Air Vice-Marshall of [[Pakistan Air Force]].\n\n==Australia==\n[[File:Australian Census 2011 demographic map - Australia by SLA - BCP field 1120 Irish Total Responses.svg|thumb|right|300px|People with Irish ancestry as a percentage of the population in Australia divided geographically by statistical local area, as of the 2011 census]]\n{{Main|Irish Australian}}\n'''Irish Australians''' form the second largest [[ethnic group]] in Australia, numbering 2,087,800 or 10.4 per cent of respondents in the 2011 Census.\n\nIt is not clear whether the Irish-born are considered \"[[Irish Australians]]\" or if the term only refers to their Australian-born descendants. The 2001 Census recorded 50,320 Irish-born in Australia, although this is a minimal figure as it only includes those who wrote in \"Ireland\" or \"Republic of Ireland\" as their country of birth. Responses which mentioned \"Northern Ireland\" as birthplace were coded as \"United Kingdom\". This interpretation may omit as few as 21,500 Irish-born present in the country, as many as 29,500, or possibly even more.

The Irish first came over in large numbers as [[convicts]] (50,000 were transported between 1791 and 1867), to be used as free labour; even larger numbers of [[free settlers]] came during the 19th century, partly due to the [[Donegal Relief Fund]]. Irish immigrants accounted for one-quarter of Australia's overseas-born population in 1871. Their descendants played a definitive role in shaping Australian history, society and culture. It has been argued that the Irish language was the source of a significant number of words in [[Australian English]].<ref>See the discussion in Lonergan, Dymphna, ''Sounds Irish: The Irish Language in Australia'', Lythrum Press, 2004; {{ISBN|1 921013 00 1}}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Patrick O'Farrell]] noted in ''The Irish in Australia'' (1987) that the term \"Australia first\" became \"what amounted to the Australian Irish Catholic slogan\". These Australians of Irish background did not tend to regard Ireland as their \"mother country\" \u2013 primarily because few had a wish to return to a home they had left in search of a better life. Rather, they tended to identify themselves as Australians.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}<!-- EDIT NOTE: It is not clear what anti-Irish bias in Australia is being referenced (if any such reference exists) in the quote previously provided from Ned Kelly -->\n\nAccording to census data released by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] in 2004, Irish Australians are, by religion, 46.2% [[Roman Catholic]], 15.3% [[Anglican]], 13.5% other Christian denomination, 3.6% other religions, and 21.5% as \"No Religion\". The high percentage of Roman Catholics is largely the result of descendants of Irish immigrants.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nApproximately 20% of Australian school students are currently{{when|date=December 2011}} enrolled in Roman Catholic schools that were, in large part, established by Irish Catholic religious orders. Large numbers of Irish priests, nuns and brothers followed other Irish immigrants to Australia from the earliest years of European settlement to provide education to the children of those immigrants.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==South Africa==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nIrish communities can be found in [[Cape Town]], [[Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape|Port Elizabeth]], [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], and [[Johannesburg]], with smaller communities in [[Pretoria]], [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]], [[Durban]] and [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]]. A third of the Cape's governors were Irish, as were many of the judges and politicians. Both the Cape Colony and the [[Colony of Natal]] had Irish prime ministers: Sir [[Thomas Upington]], \"The [[Afrikaner]] from [[Cork (city)|Cork]]\"; and [[Albert Henry Hime|Sir Albert Hime]], from [[Kilcoole]] in [[County Wicklow]]. Irish Cape Governors included [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]], [[Du Pre Alexander, 2nd Earl of Caledon|Lord Caledon]] and [[Sir John Francis Cradock]].\n\nHenry Nourse, a shipowner at the Cape, brought out a small party of Irish settlers in 1818. In 1823, John Ingram brought out 146 Irish from Cork. Single Irish women were sent to the Cape on a few occasions. Twenty arrived in November 1849 and 46 arrived in March 1851. The majority arrived in November 1857 aboard the ''Lady Kennaway''. A large contingent of Irish troops fought in the [[Second Boer War|Anglo-Boer War]] on both sides and a few of them stayed in South Africa after the war. Others returned home but later came out to settle in South Africa with their families. Between 1902 and 1905, there were about 5,000 Irish immigrants. Places in South Africa named after Irish people include [[Upington, Northern Cape|Upington]], [[Porterville, Western Cape|Porterville]], [[Caledon, Western Cape|Caledon]], [[Cradock, Eastern Cape|Cradock]], [[Sir Lowry's Pass]], the Biggarsberg Mountains, [[Donnybrook, KwaZulu-Natal|Donnybrook]], [[Himeville]] and [[Belfast, Mpumalanga|Belfast]].\n\n==New Zealand==\n{{Main|Irish New Zealanders}}\nThe Diaspora population of Ireland also got a fresh start on the islands of [[New Zealand]] during the later half of the 19th century. The ideology of striking it rich in the gold mines caused many Irish people to flock to the docks; risking their lives on the long voyage to potential freedom and more importantly self-sufficiency. Most famous places including both [[Gabriel's Gully]] and [[Otago Gold Rush|Otago]] are examples of mining sites which, with the funding of large companies, allowed for the creation of wages and the appearance of mining towns. Women found jobs as housemaids cleaning the shacks of the single men at work thereby providing a second income to the Irish family household. The subsequent money accumulated with regards to this would allow for [[chain migration]] for the rest of the family left behind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunedinlibraries.govt.nz/kids/homework-zone/early-dunedin-and-otago/otago-gold-rush|title=Youth|first=Dunedin Public|last=Libraries|website=Dunedinlibraries.govt.nz|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Transition to New Zealand was made easier due to the overexposure that the Irish had previously had with colonialism. They ventured upwards to the British ports, settling temporarily to accumulate the necessary finances before moving onwards towards the banks of the far away island. In doing so, they not only exposed themselves to the form of British form of government but likewise to capitalism. This aided to further the simplicity of the transition for the dispersed population.<ref>Fraser, Lyndon. \"Structure and agency: Comparative perspectives on Catholic Irish experiences in New Zealand and the U.S\" (December 1995) Vol 14 No 2. pp 93. Kenny, Kevin. \"A global Irish Case Study\" (June 2003) vol.90 No 1.pp.&nbsp;153.</ref>\n\nThe government aided through the use of both promissory notes and land grants. By promising to pay for the passage of a family the government ensured that the island would be populated and a British colony would be formed. Free passage was installed for women first between the ages of 15-35, while males between the ages of 18\u201340 years of age would be promised a certain amount of acres of land upon arrival in the New World. This was attributed to the installment of the New Zealand Land act. To further aid with the financial burden, free passage to any immigrant was granted after 1874.<ref>\nCarthy, Angela. \"Personal letters and the Organization of Irish Migrants to and from New Zealand 1848-1925\"(May 2003) Vol. 33 no. 131 pp.&nbsp;303</ref>\n\nA final note with regards to importance of the Irish diaspora population in New Zealand deals with the diminished amount of prejudice present for the Roman Catholic population upon arrival. The lack of embedded hierarchy and social structure in the New World allowed for previous sectarian tensions to be dissolved. This can also be attributed to the sheer amount of distance between the respective religions due to the sparseness of the unpopulated area and the sheer size of the islands.<ref>Nolan, Melanie \"Kith, Kirk and the Working class of [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]]: A transfer of Ulster Scots culture to New Zealand\" vol 209 (2004) pp 21.</ref>\n\n== List of countries by population of Irish heritage ==\n:{{cleanup section|time=2015-10-07|reason=questionable pop. and % figures|date=October 2015}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=width:40% | Country || Population || % of country || Criterion\n|-\n| ''Irish in North America'' || || ||\n|-\n| {{flagicon|USA}} [[Irish American]] || align=\"right\" | 33,348,049 || align=\"right\" | 10.50%\n||\nSelf-identified \"Irish\"<br />33,348,049<ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk \"Selected Social Characteristics in the United States (DP02): 2013 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6gpGlyhlr?url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk |date=17 April 2016 }}</ref><br /><small>10.50% of the US population (2013)</small><br />Scotch-Irish Americans<br />27 to 30 million<ref name=\"BFFF\">James Webb, ''Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America'' (New York: Broadway Books, 2004), front flap: 'More than 27 million Americans today can trace their lineage to the Scots, whose bloodline was stained by centuries of continuous warfare along the border between England and Scotland, and later in the bitter settlements of England's Ulster Plantation in Northern Ireland.' {{ISBN|0-7679-1688-3}}</ref><ref name=\"Secret\">James Webb, [http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110005798 Secret GOP Weapon: The Scots Irish Vote], ''Wall Street Journal'' (23 October 2004).

The establishment of an 'Irish Episcopal Empire' involved three transnational entities \u2013 the British Empire, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Irish diaspora. Irish clergy, notably Cullen, made particular use of the reach of the British Empire to spread their influence. From the 1830s until his death in 1878, Cullen held several key positions near the top of the Irish hierarchy and influenced Rome's appointment of Irish bishops on four continents.<ref>Colin Barr, \"'Imperium in Imperio': Irish Episcopal Imperialism in the Nineteenth Century\", ''English Historical Review'' 2008 123(502): pp. 611\u201350.</ref>\n\nWalker (2007) compares Irish immigrant communities in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Great Britain respecting issues of identity and 'Irishness.' Religion remained the major cause of differentiation in all Irish diaspora communities and had the greatest impact on identity, followed by the nature and difficulty of socio-economic conditions faced in each new country and the strength of continued social and political links of Irish immigrants and their descendants with Ireland.\n\nIn the United States specifically, Irish immigrants were persecuted because of their religion. The Know Nothing Movement sprung up during the time of the Irish's arrival.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Maha|first=Sorin-Stefan|date=December 2011|title=The Migration of Europeans to the United States at the Middle of the 19th Century - the Irish and German Wave |journal=Centre for European Studies Working Papers |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=556\u2013562 |url=http://www.ceswp.uaic.ro/articles/CESWP2011_III4_MAH.pdf |accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref> The Know Nothing Party was formed by Protestants and was the first political party in American history to push against Catholic immigration to the United States, particularly targeting Irish and German immigrants. The Know Nothings fought&nbsp; to limit immigration from traditional Catholic countries, prohibit non-English language speaking on US territory, and create a policy where you must spend 21 years in the US before gaining citizenship.<ref name=\":0\" /> The party faded out of existence relatively quickly, but they are a reminder of the persecution Irish immigrants faced. During the third and fourth waves of immigration, new arrivals faced similar discrimination and the now settled Irish would take part in this persecution of other groups.\n\nFrom the late 20th century onward, Irish identity abroad became increasingly cultural, non-denominational, and non-political, although many emigrants from Northern Ireland stood apart from this trend. However, Ireland as religious reference point is now increasingly significant in [[neopaganism|neopagan]] contexts.<ref>Catherine Maignant, \"Irish base, global religion: the Fellowship of Isis\". 262\u2013280 in Olivia Cosgrove et al.

Like the natural numbers, {{math|'''Z'''}} is [[Countable set|countably infinite]].\n\nThe integers form the smallest [[Group (mathematics)|group]] and the smallest [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] containing the [[natural number]]s. In [[algebraic number theory]], the integers are sometimes qualified as '''rational integers''' to distinguish them from the more general [[algebraic integer]]s. In fact, the (rational) integers are the algebraic integers that are also [[rational number]]s.\n\n==Symbol==\n\nThe symbol {{math|'''Z'''}} can be annotated to denote various sets, with varying usage amongst different authors: {{math|'''Z'''<sup>+</sup>}}, {{math|'''Z'''<sub>+</sub>}} or {{math|'''Z'''<sup>></sup>}} for the positive integers, {{math|'''Z'''<sup>\u2265</sup>}} for non-negative integers, {{math|'''Z'''<sup>\u2260</sup>}} for non-zero integers. Some authors use {{math|'''Z'''<sup>*</sup>}} for non-zero integers, others use it for non-negative integers, or for {{math|{\u20131, 1}{{void}}}}. Additionally, {{math|'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is used to denote either the set of [[integers modulo n|integers modulo {{math|''p''}}]], i.e., a set of [[congruence relation|congruence classes]] of integers, or the set of [[p-adic integer|{{math|''p''}}-adic integers]].<ref name=edexcelc1>Keith Pledger and Dave Wilkins, \"Edexcel AS and A Level Modular Mathematics: Core Mathematics 1\" Pearson 2008</ref><ref>LK Turner, FJ BUdden, D Knighton, \"Advanced Mathematics\", Book 2, Longman 1975.</ref><ref>{{MathWorld |title=Z^* |id=Z^*}}</ref>\n\n== Algebraic properties ==\n[[File:Number-line.svg|right|thumb|300px|Integers can be thought of as discrete, equally spaced points on an infinitely long [[number line]]. In the above, non-[[Sign (mathematics)#Terminology for signs|negative]] integers are shown in purple and negative integers in red.]]\n\nLike the [[natural numbers]], {{math|'''Z'''}} is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the [[binary operation|operations]] of addition and [[multiplication]], that is, the sum and product of any two integers is an integer. However, with the inclusion of the negative natural numbers, and, importantly,&nbsp;{{num|0}}, {{math|'''Z'''}} (unlike the natural numbers) is also closed under [[subtraction]]. The integers form a [[unital ring]] which is the most basic one, in the following sense: for any unital ring, there is a unique [[ring homomorphism]] from the integers into this ring. This [[universal property]], namely to be an [[initial object]] in the [[category of rings]], characterizes the ring&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}}.\n\n{{math|'''Z'''}} is not closed under [[division (mathematics)|division]], since the quotient of two integers (e.g.,&nbsp;1 divided by&nbsp;2), need not be an integer. Although the natural numbers are closed under [[exponentiation]], the integers are not (since the result can be a fraction when the exponent is negative).\n\nThe following lists some of the basic properties of addition and multiplication for any integers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}}.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Properties of addition and multiplication on integers\n!\n!scope=\"col\" |Addition \n!scope=\"col\" |Multiplication\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Closure (mathematics)|Closure]]: \n|{{math|''a'' + ''b''}}{{pad|1em}}is an integer \n|{{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b''}}{{pad|1em}}is an integer\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Associativity]]: \n|{{math|''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}\n|{{math|''a'' \u00d7 (''b'' \u00d7 ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' \u00d7 ''b'') \u00d7 ''c''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Commutativity]]: \n|{{math|''a'' + ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' + ''a''}}\n|{{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' \u00d7 ''a''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Existence of an [[identity element]]: \n|{{math|''a'' + 0 {{=}} ''a''}} \n|{{math|''a'' \u00d7 1 {{=}} ''a''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Existence of [[inverse element]]s: \n|{{math|''a'' + (\u2212''a'') {{=}} 0}} \n|The only invertible rational integers (called units) are {{math|\u22121}} and&nbsp;{{math|1}}.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Distributivity]]: \n|colspan=2 align=center |{{math|''a'' \u00d7 (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' \u00d7 ''b'') + (''a'' \u00d7 ''c'')}}{{pad|1em}}and{{pad|1em}}{{math|(''a'' + ''b'') \u00d7 ''c'' {{=}} (''a'' \u00d7 ''c'') + (''b'' \u00d7 ''c'')}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |No [[zero divisor]]s: \n| || | If {{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b'' {{=}} 0}}, then {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''b'' {{=}} 0}} (or both)\n|}\n\nIn the language of [[abstract algebra]], the first five properties listed above for addition say that {{math|'''Z'''}} under addition is an [[abelian group]]. It is also a [[cyclic group]], since every non-zero integer can be written as a finite sum {{nowrap|1 + 1 + \u2026 + 1}} or {{nowrap|(\u22121) + (\u22121) + \u2026 + (\u22121)}}. In fact, {{math|'''Z'''}} under addition is the ''only'' infinite cyclic group, in the sense that any infinite cyclic group is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to {{math|'''Z'''}}.\n\nThe first four properties listed above for multiplication say that {{math|'''Z'''}} under multiplication is a [[commutative monoid]]. However, not every integer has a multiplicative inverse; e.g., there is no integer {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|2''x'' {{=}} 1,}} because the left hand side is even, while the right hand side is odd. This means that {{math|'''Z'''}} under multiplication is not a group.\n\nAll the rules from the above property table, except for the last, taken together say that {{math|'''Z'''}} together with addition and multiplication is a [[commutative ring]] with [[multiplicative identity|unity]]. It is the prototype of all objects of such [[algebraic structure]]. Only those [[equality (mathematics)|equalities]] of [[algebraic expression|expressions]] are true in&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}} [[for all]] values of variables, which are true in any unital commutative ring. Note that certain non-zero integers map to [[additive identity|zero]] in certain rings.\n\nThe lack of [[zero divisor]]s in the integers (last property in the table) means that the commutative ring&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}} is an [[integral domain]].\n\nThe lack of multiplicative inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that {{math|'''Z'''}} is not closed under division, means that {{math|'''Z'''}} is ''not'' a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. The smallest field containing the integers as a [[subring]] is the field of [[rational number]]s. The process of constructing the rationals from the integers can be mimicked to form the [[field of fractions]] of any integral domain. And back, starting from an [[algebraic number field]] (an extension of rational numbers), its [[ring of integers]] can be extracted, which includes {{math|'''Z'''}} as its [[subring]].\n\nAlthough ordinary division is not defined on {{math|'''Z'''}}, the division \"with remainder\" is defined on them. It is called [[Euclidean division]] and possesses the following important property: that is, given two integers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} with {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}, there exist unique integers {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''r''}} such that {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''q'' \u00d7 ''b'' + ''r''}} and {{math|0 \u2264 ''r'' <  {{!}}&thinsp;''b''&thinsp;{{!}}}}, where {{math|{{!}}&thinsp;''b''&thinsp;{{!}}}} denotes the [[absolute value]] of {{math|''b''}}. The integer {{math|''q''}} is called the ''quotient'' and {{math|''r''}} is called the ''[[remainder]]'' of the division of {{math|''a''}} by {{math|''b''}}. The [[Euclidean algorithm]] for computing [[greatest common divisor]]s works by a sequence of Euclidean divisions.\n\nAgain, in the language of abstract algebra, the above says that '''Z''' is a [[Euclidean domain]]. This implies that {{math|'''Z'''}} is a [[principal ideal domain]] and any positive integer can be written as the products of [[prime number|primes]] in an essentially unique way.<ref>{{citation | last=Serge|first = Lang |authorlink=Serge Lang |title = Algebra |edition=3rd| publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-201-55540-9|pp =86\u201387}}</ref> This is the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].\n\n==Order-theoretic properties==\n{{math|'''Z'''}} is a [[total order|totally ordered set]] without upper or lower bound.

Zero is defined as neither negative nor positive.\n\nThe ordering of integers is compatible with the algebraic operations in the following way:\n#if {{math|''a'' < ''b''}} and {{math|''c'' < ''d''}}, then {{math|''a'' + ''c'' < ''b'' + ''d''}}\n#if {{math|''a'' < ''b''}} and {{math|0 < ''c''}}, then {{math|''ac'' < ''bc''}}.\n\nIt follows that {{math|'''Z'''}} together with the above ordering is an [[ordered ring]].\n\nThe integers are the only nontrivial totally ordered abelian group whose positive elements are [[well-ordered]].<ref>{{citation|title=Modern Algebra|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first=Seth|last=Warner|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=2012|isbn=9780486137094|at=Theorem 20.14, p.&nbsp;185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqHDAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA185}}.</ref> This is equivalent to the statement that any [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[valuation ring]] is either a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] or a [[discrete valuation ring]].\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Relative numbers representation.svg|thumb|alt=Representation of equivalence classes for the numbers \u22125 to 5\n|Red points represent ordered pairs of [[natural number]]s.

The natural number {{math|''n''}} is identified with the class {{math|[(''n'',0)]}} (in other words the natural numbers are [[embedding|embedded]] into the integers by map sending {{math|''n''}} to {{math|[(''n'',0)]}}), and the class {{math|[(0,''n'')]}} is denoted {{math|\u2212''n''}} (this covers all remaining classes, and gives the class {{math|[(0,0)]}} a second time since {{math|\u22120 {{=}} 0.}}\n\nThus, {{math|[(''a'',''b'')]}} is denoted by\n:<math>\\begin{cases} a - b, & \\mbox{if }  a \\ge b  \\\\ -(b - a),  & \\mbox{if } a < b. \\end{cases}</math>\n\nIf the natural numbers are identified with the corresponding integers (using the embedding mentioned above), this convention creates no ambiguity.\n\nThis notation recovers the familiar [[group representation|representation]] of the integers as  {{math|{\u2026, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, \u2026}}}.\n\nSome examples are:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n 0 &= [(0,0)] &= [(1,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k)] \\\\\n 1 &= [(1,0)] &= [(2,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k+1,k)] \\\\\n-1 &= [(0,1)] &= [(1,2)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k+1)] \\\\\n 2 &= [(2,0)] &= [(3,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k+2,k)] \\\\\n-2 &= [(0,2)] &= [(1,3)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k+2)].\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn theoretical computer science, other approaches for the construction of integers are used by [[Automated theorem proving|automated theorem provers]] and [[Rewriting|term rewrite engines]]. \nIntegers are represented as [[Term algebra|algebraic terms]] built using a few basic operations  (such as '''zero''', '''succ''', '''pred''', etc.) and, possibly, using [[Natural number|natural numbers]], which are assumed to be already constructed (e.g., using the Peano approach).\n\nThere exist at least ten such constructions of signed integers.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Garavel |first=Hubert |title=On the Most Suitable Axiomatization of Signed Integers |conference=Post-proceedings of the 23rd International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques (WADT'2016) |year=2017 |publisher=Springer |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=10644 |pages=120-134 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-72044-9_9 |url= https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01667321}}</ref> These constructions differ in several ways: the number of basic operations used for the construction, the number (usually, between 0 and 2) and the types of arguments accepted by these operations; the presence or absence of natural numbers as arguments of some of these operations, and the fact that these operations are free constructors or not, i.e., that the same integer can be represented using only one or many algebraic terms.\n\nThe technique for the construction of integers presented above in this section corresponds to the particular case where there is a single basic operation '''pair'''<math>(x,y)</math> that takes as arguments two natural numbers <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, and returns an integer (equal to <math>x-y</math>). This operation is not free since the integer 0 can be written '''pair'''(0,0), or '''pair'''(1,1), or '''pair'''(2,2), etc. This technique of construction is used by the [[proof assistant]] [[Isabelle_(proof_assistant)|Isabelle]]; however, many other tools use alternative construction techniques, notable those based upon free constructors, which are simpler and can be implemented more efficiently in computers.\n\n==Computer science==\n{{Main|Integer (computer science)}}\nAn integer is often a primitive [[data type]] in [[computer language]]s. However, integer data types can only represent a [[subset]] of all integers, since practical computers are of finite capacity. Also, in the common [[two's complement]] representation, the inherent definition of [[sign (mathematics)|sign]] distinguishes between \"negative\" and \"non-negative\" rather than \"negative, positive, and&nbsp;0\". (It is, however, certainly possible for a computer to determine whether an integer value is truly positive.) Fixed length integer approximation data types (or subsets) are denoted ''int'' or Integer in several programming languages (such as [[Algol68]], [[C (computer language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Object Pascal|Delphi]], etc.).\n\nVariable-length representations of integers, such as [[bignum]]s, can store any integer that fits in the computer's memory. Other integer data types are implemented with a fixed size, usually a number of bits which is a power of&nbsp;2 (4, 8, 16, etc.) or a memorable number of decimal digits (e.g., 9 or&nbsp;10).\n\n==Cardinality==\nThe [[cardinality]] of the set of integers is equal to {{math|\u2135{{sub|0}}}} ([[Aleph number|aleph-null]]). This is readily demonstrated by the construction of a [[bijection]], that is, a function that is [[injective]] and [[surjective]] from {{math|'''Z'''}} to {{math|'''N'''}}.\nIf {{math|'''N''' {{=}} <nowiki>{</nowiki>0, 1, 2, \u2026&#125;}} then consider the function:\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases} 2|x|,  & \\mbox{if } x \\leq 0\\\\ 2x-1, & \\mbox{if }  x > 0. \\end{cases} </math>\n{{math|<nowiki>{\u2026</nowiki> (\u22124,8) (\u22123,6) (\u22122,4) (\u22121,2) (0,0) (1,1) (2,3) (3,5) \u2026&#125;}}\n\nIf {{math|'''N''' {{=}} <nowiki>{</nowiki>1, 2, 3, ...&#125;}} then consider the function:\n:<math>g(x) = \\begin{cases} 2|x|,  & \\mbox{if } x < 0 \\\\ 2x+1, & \\mbox{if }  x \\ge 0. \\end{cases} </math>\n{{math|{\u2026 (\u22124,8) (\u22123,6) (\u22122,4) (\u22121,2) (0,1) (1,3) (2,5) (3,7) \u2026&#125;}}\n\nIf the domain is restricted to {{math|'''Z'''}} then each and every member of {{math|'''Z'''}} has one and only one corresponding member of '''N''' and by the definition of cardinal equality the two sets have equal cardinality.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n*[[0.999...]]\n*[[Canonical representation of a positive integer]]\n*[[Hyperinteger]]\n*[[Integer-valued function]]\n*[[Integer lattice]]\n*[[Integer part]]\n*[[Integer sequence]]\n*[[Profinite integer]]\n* [[Mathematical symbols]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*[[Eric Temple Bell|Bell, E.T.]], ''[[Men of Mathematics]].''

Ravel wrote, \"this impressionism is certainly very different from that of present-day composers...Mr. Fanelli's impressionism derives more directly from Berlioz.\" He added that Fanelli's alleged priority does not in any way diminish the achievements of later composers: \"the investigations of the young Fanelli could not have diminished those of his colleagues...It is peculiar that these investigations suddenly assume importance because their embryo is discovered in a work written 30 years ago.\"<ref name = \"adr\">Maurice Ravel, ''A Ravel Reader: Correspondence, Articles, Interviews'', compiled and edited by [[Arbie Orenstein]] (New York: Columbia University Press, 1990): pp. 349\u201342.{{Clarify|date=December 2017|reason=That page range is baffling.}} {{ISBN|9780231049627}}.

While international trade has existed throughout history (for example [[Uttarapatha]], [[Silk Road]], [[Amber Road]], [[scramble for Africa]], [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[salt road]]s), its economic, social, and political importance has been on the rise in recent centuries. Carrying out trade at an international level is a more complex process than domestic trade. Trade takes place between two or more nations. Factors like the economy, government policies, markets, laws, judicial system, currency, etc. influence the trade. The political relations between two countries also influences the trade between them. Sometimes, the obstacles in the way of trading affect the mutual relationship adversly. To avoid this, international economic and trade organisations came up. To smoothen and justify the process of trade between countries of different economic standing, some international economic organisations were formed. These organisations work towards the facilitation and growth of international trade.\n\n==Characteristic of global trade==\n\nTrading globally gives consumers and countries the opportunity to be exposed to new markets and products. Almost every kind of product can be found in the international market: food, clothes, spare parts, oil, jewelry, wine, stocks, currencies, and water. Services are also traded: tourism, banking, consulting, and transportation. A product that is sold to the global market is an [[export]], and a product that is bought from the global market is an [[import]]. Imports and exports are accounted for in a country's current account in the balance of payments.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bop.asp|title=Balance Of Payments (BOP)|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-25|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Silkroutes.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Ancient [[Silk Road]] [[trade routes]] across [[Eurasia]]]]\n\n[[Industrialization]], advanced technology, including [[transport]]ation, [[globalization]], [[multinational corporation]]s, and [[outsourcing]] are all having a major impact on the international trade system. Increasing international trade is crucial to the continuance of globalization. Nations would be limited to the goods and services produced within their own borders without international trade. International trade is, in principle, not different from [[domestic trade]] as the motivation and the behavior of parties involved in a trade do not change fundamentally regardless of whether trade is across a border or not. The main difference is that international trade is typically more costly than domestic trade. This is due to the fact that a border typically imposes additional costs such as [[tariff]]s, time costs due to border delays, and costs associated with country differences such as language, the legal system, or culture.\n\nAnother difference between domestic and '''international trade''' is that [[factors of production]] such as capital and [[Labour economics|labor]] are typically more mobile within a country than across countries. Thus, international trade is mostly restricted to trade in goods and services, and only to a lesser extent to trade in capital, labour, or other factors of production. Trade in goods and services can serve as a substitute for trade in factors of production. Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of that factor of production and thus embody it. An example of this is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China. Instead of importing Chinese labor, the United States imports goods that were produced with Chinese labor. One report in 2010 suggested that international trade was increased when a country hosted a network of immigrants, but the trade effect was weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into their new country.<ref name=twsA36>{{cite news\n |author= Kusum Mundra\n |title= Immigrant Networks and U.S. Bilateral Trade: The Role of Immigrant Income\n |publisher= ''papers.ssrn''\n |quote= Mundra, Kusum, Immigrant Networks and U.S. Bilateral Trade: The Role of Immigrant Income.

In simple problems, this method is unlikely to be used, as linear interpolation (see below) is almost as easy, but in higher-dimensional [[multivariate interpolation]], this could be a favourable choice for its speed and simplicity.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Linear interpolation===\n[[File:Interpolation example linear.svg|right|thumb|230px|Plot of the data with linear interpolation superimposed]]\n{{Main|Linear interpolation}}\nOne of the simplest methods is [[linear]] interpolation (sometimes known as lerp). Consider the above example of estimating ''f''(2.5). Since 2.5 is midway between 2 and 3, it is reasonable to take ''f''(2.5) midway between ''f''(2) = 0.9093 and ''f''(3) = 0.1411, which yields 0.5252.\n\nGenerally, linear interpolation takes two data points, say (''x''<sub>''a''</sub>,''y''<sub>''a''</sub>) and (''x''<sub>''b''</sub>,''y''<sub>''b''</sub>), and the interpolant is given by:\n:<math> y = y_a + \\left( y_b-y_a \\right) \\frac{x-x_a}{x_b-x_a} \\text{ at the point } \\left( x,y \\right) </math>\n\n\n:<math> \\frac{y-y_a}{y_b-y_a} = \\frac{x-x_a}{x_b-x_a} </math>\n\n\n:<math> \\frac{y-y_a}{x-x_a} = \\frac{y_b-y_a}{x_b-x_a} </math>\n\n\nThis previous equation states that the slope of the new line between <math> (x_a,y_a) </math> and <math> (x,y) </math> is the same as the slope of the line between <math> (x_a,y_a) </math> and <math> (x_b,y_b) </math>\n\nLinear interpolation is quick and easy, but it is not very precise. Another disadvantage is that the interpolant is not [[derivative|differentiable]] at the point ''x''<sub>''k''</sub>.\n\nThe following error estimate shows that linear interpolation is not very precise. Denote the function which we want to interpolate by ''g'', and suppose that ''x'' lies between ''x''<sub>''a''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''b''</sub> and that ''g'' is twice continuously differentiable. Then the linear interpolation error is\n\n:<math> |f(x)-g(x)| \\le C(x_b-x_a)^2 \\quad\\text{where}\\quad C = \\frac18 \\max_{r\\in[x_a,x_b]} |g''(r)|. </math>\n\nIn words, the error is proportional to the square of the distance between the data points. The error in some other methods, including polynomial interpolation and spline interpolation (described below), is proportional to higher powers of the distance between the data points. These methods also produce smoother interpolants.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Polynomial interpolation===\n[[File:Interpolation example polynomial.svg|right|thumb|230px|Plot of the data with polynomial interpolation applied]]\n{{Main|Polynomial interpolation}}\nPolynomial interpolation is a generalization of linear interpolation. Note that the linear interpolant is a [[linear function]]. We now replace this interpolant with a [[polynomial]] of higher [[degree of a polynomial|degree]].\n\nConsider again the problem given above. The following sixth degree polynomial goes through all the seven points:\n:<math> f(x) = -0.0001521 x^6 - 0.003130 x^5 + 0.07321 x^4 - 0.3577 x^3 + 0.2255 x^2 + 0.9038 x. </math>\n<!-- Coefficients are 0, 0.903803333333334, 0.22549749999997, -0.35772291666664, 0.07321458333332, -0.00313041666667, -0.00015208333333. -->\nSubstituting ''x'' = 2.5, we find that ''f''(2.5) = 0.5965.\n\nGenerally, if we have ''n'' data points, there is exactly one polynomial of degree at most ''n''&minus;1 going through all the data points. The interpolation error is proportional to the distance between the data points to the power ''n''. Furthermore, the interpolant is a polynomial and thus infinitely differentiable. So, we see that polynomial interpolation overcomes most of the problems of linear interpolation.\n\nHowever, polynomial interpolation also has some disadvantages. Calculating the interpolating polynomial is computationally expensive (see [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]]) compared to linear interpolation. Furthermore, polynomial interpolation may exhibit oscillatory artifacts, especially at the end points (see [[Runge's phenomenon]]).\n\nPolynomial interpolation can estimate local maxima and minima that are outside the range of the samples, unlike linear interpolation. For example, the interpolant above has a local maximum at ''x'' \u2248 1.566, ''f''(''x'') \u2248 1.003 and a local minimum at ''x'' \u2248 4.708, ''f''(''x'') \u2248 \u22121.003. However, these maxima and minima may exceed the theoretical range of the function\u2014for example, a function that is always positive may have an interpolant with negative values, and whose inverse therefore contains false [[division by zero|vertical asymptotes]].\n\nMore generally, the shape of the resulting curve, especially for very high or low values of the independent variable, may be contrary to commonsense, i.e. to what is known about the experimental system which has generated the data points. These disadvantages can be reduced by using spline interpolation or restricting attention to [[Chebyshev polynomials]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Spline interpolation===\n[[File:Interpolation example spline.svg|right|thumb|230px|Plot of the data with spline interpolation applied]]\n{{Main|Spline interpolation}}\n\nRemember that linear interpolation uses a linear function for each of intervals [''x''<sub>''k''</sub>,''x''<sub>''k+1''</sub>]. Spline interpolation uses low-degree polynomials in each of the intervals, and chooses the polynomial pieces such that they fit smoothly together. The resulting function is called a [[spline (mathematics)|spline]].\n\nFor instance, the [[natural cubic spline]] is [[piecewise]] cubic and twice continuously differentiable. Furthermore, its second derivative is zero at the end points. The natural cubic spline interpolating the points in the table above is given by\n\n: <math> f(x) = \\begin{cases}\n-0.1522 x^3 + 0.9937 x, & \\text{if } x \\in [0,1], \\\\\n-0.01258 x^3 - 0.4189 x^2 + 1.4126 x - 0.1396, & \\text{if } x \\in [1,2], \\\\\n0.1403 x^3 - 1.3359 x^2 + 3.2467 x - 1.3623, & \\text{if } x \\in [2,3], \\\\\n0.1579 x^3 - 1.4945 x^2 + 3.7225 x - 1.8381, & \\text{if } x \\in [3,4], \\\\\n0.05375 x^3 -0.2450 x^2 - 1.2756 x + 4.8259, & \\text{if } x \\in [4,5], \\\\\n-0.1871 x^3 + 3.3673 x^2 - 19.3370 x + 34.9282, & \\text{if } x \\in [5,6].\n\\end{cases} </math>\n\nIn this case we get ''f''(2.5)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5972.\n\nLike polynomial interpolation, spline interpolation incurs a smaller error than linear interpolation and the interpolant is smoother. However, the interpolant is easier to evaluate than the high-degree polynomials used in polynomial interpolation. However, the global nature of the basis functions leads to ill-conditioning. This is completely mitigated by using splines of compact support, such as are implemented in Boost.Math and discussed in Kress.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kress|first1=Rainer|title=Numerical Analysis|year=1998}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Via Gaussian processes==\n[[Gaussian process]] is a powerful non-linear interpolation tool. Many popular interpolation tools are actually equivalent to particular Gaussian processes. Gaussian processes can be used not only for fitting an interpolant that passes exactly through the given data points but also for regression, i.e., for fitting a curve through noisy data. In the geostatistics community Gaussian process regression is also known as [[Kriging]].\n\n==Other forms==\nOther forms of interpolation can be constructed by picking a different class of interpolants. For instance, rational interpolation is '''interpolation''' by [[rational function]]s using [[Pad\u00e9 approximant]], and [[trigonometric interpolation]] is interpolation by [[trigonometric polynomial]]s using [[Fourier series]]. Another possibility is to use [[wavelet]]s.\n\nThe [[Whittaker\u2013Shannon interpolation formula]] can be used if the number of data points is infinite.\n\nSometimes, we know not only the value of the function that we want to interpolate, at some points, but also its derivative. This leads to [[Hermite interpolation]] problems.\n\nWhen each data point is itself a function, it can be useful to see the interpolation problem as a partial [[advection]] problem between each data point. This idea leads to the [[displacement interpolation]] problem used in [[Transportation theory (mathematics)|transportation theory]].\n\n==In higher dimensions==\n{{comparison_of_1D_and_2D_interpolation.svg|250px|}}\n{{main|Multivariate interpolation}}\nMultivariate interpolation is the interpolation of functions of more than one variable. \nMethods include [[bilinear interpolation]] and [[bicubic interpolation]] in two dimensions, and [[trilinear interpolation]] in three dimensions.\nThey can be applied to gridded or scattered data.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Nearest2DInterpolExample.png|Nearest neighbor\nImage:BilinearInterpolExample.png|Bilinear\nImage:BicubicInterpolationExample.png|Bicubic\n</gallery>\n\n==In digital signal processing==\nIn the domain of digital signal processing, the term interpolation refers to the process of converting a sampled digital signal (such as a sampled audio signal) to that of a higher sampling rate ([[Upsampling]]) using various digital filtering techniques (e.g., convolution with a frequency-limited impulse signal). In this application there is a specific requirement that the harmonic content of the original signal be preserved without creating aliased harmonic content of the original signal above the original Nyquist limit of the signal (i.e., above fs/2 of the original signal sample rate). An early and fairly elementary discussion on this subject can be found in Rabiner and Crochiere's book ''Multirate Digital Signal Processing''.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Multirate-Digital-Signal-Processing-Crochiere/dp/0136051626 R.E. Crochiere and L.R. Rabiner. (1983). Multirate Digital Signal Processing. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice\u2013Hall.]</ref>\n\n==Related concepts==\nThe term ''[[extrapolation]]'' is used to find data points outside the range of known data points.\n\nIn [[curve fitting]] problems, the constraint that the interpolant has to go exactly through the data points is relaxed. It is only required to approach the data points as closely as possible (within some other constraints).  This requires parameterizing the potential interpolants and having some way of measuring the error.  In the simplest case this leads to [[least squares]] approximation.\n\n[[Approximation theory]] studies how to find the best approximation to a given function by another function from some predetermined class, and how good this approximation is. This clearly yields a bound on how well the interpolant can approximate the unknown function.\n\n==Generalization==\nIf we consider <math>x</math> as a variable in a [[topological space]], with and the function <math>f(x)</math> mapping to a [[Banach space]], then the problem is treated as \"interpolation of operators\".<ref>Colin Bennett, Robert C. Sharpley, ''Interpolation of Operators'', Academic Press 1988</ref> The classical results about interpolation of operators are the [[Riesz\u2013Thorin theorem]] and the [[Marcinkiewicz theorem]]. There are also many other subsequent results.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Barycentric coordinate system (mathematics)|Barycentric coordinates \u2013 for interpolating within on a triangle or tetrahedron]]\n* [[Bilinear interpolation]]\n* [[Brahmagupta's interpolation formula]]\n* [[Extrapolation]]\n* [[Imputation (statistics)]]\n* [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrange interpolation]]\n* [[Missing data]]\n* [[Multivariate interpolation]]\n* [[Newton\u2013Cotes formulas]]\n* [[Polynomial interpolation]]\n* [[Simple rational approximation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* Online tools for [http://tools.timodenk.com/linear-interpolation linear], [http://tools.timodenk.com/quadratic-interpolation quadratic], [http://tools.timodenk.com/cubic-spline-interpolation cubic spline], and [http://tools.timodenk.com/polynomial-interpolation polynomial] interpolation with visualisation and [[JavaScript]] source code.\n* [http://sol.gfxile.net/interpolation/index.html Sol Tutorials - Interpolation Tricks]\n* [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/cubic_b.html Compactly Supported Cubic B-Spline interpolation in Boost.Math]\n* [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/barycentric.html Barycentric rational interpolation in Boost.Math]\n* [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/sf_poly/chebyshev.html Interpolation via the Chebyshev transform in Boost.Math]\n[[Category:Interpolation| ]]\n[[Category:Video]]\n[[Category:Video signal]]", "sha1": "227v496kl7y9u86achn25o7sd38yjev"}}, {"title": "Intension", "ns": "0", "id": "14570", "revision": {"id": "861537467", "parentid": "849310596", "timestamp": "2018-09-28T04:40:37Z", "contributor": {"username": "Spacemarine10", "id": "20501809"}, "minor": "", "comment": "no one karyotyped Aristotle's sister", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|referential context|the identically pronounced term referring to a future commitment|Intention|the state of having intension|intentionality|the song \"Intension\" by Tool|10,000 Days (Tool album)}}\n<!--Note that an italicized letter ''s'' or ''t'' is sometimes used for distinction-->\n\nIn [[linguistics]], [[logic]], [[philosophy]], and other fields, an '''intension''' is any [[Property (philosophy)|property]] or [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] [[Connotation|connoted]] by a [[word]], [[phrase]], or another symbol.<ref>{{cite book|page=117|author=[[Antony Flew]]|date=1979|title=Dictionary of Philosophy}}</ref> In the case of a word, the word's [[definition]] often implies an intension. For instance, intension of the word ''[[plant]]'' includes properties like \"being composed of [[cellulose]]\" and \"alive\" and \"organism\", among others. ''[[comprehension (logic)|Comprehension]]'' is the collection of all such intensions.\n\nThe meaning of a word can be thought of as the bond between the ''idea the word means'' and the ''physical form of the word''. Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857\u20131913) contrasts three concepts:\n\n# the ''signifier'' \u2013 the \"sound image\" or the string of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] on a page that one recognizes as the form of a [[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]\n# the ''signified'' \u2013 the meaning, the [[concept]] or [[idea]] that a sign expresses or evokes\n# the ''referent'' \u2013 the actual [[Object (philosophy)|thing]] or set of things a sign refers to. See ''[[Sign (semiotics)#Dyadic signs|Dyadic signs]]'' and ''[[Reference#Semantics|Reference (semantics)]]''.\n\nWithout intension of some sort, a word has no meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Hilary|date=1973|title=Meaning and Reference|jstor=2025079|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=70|issue=19|pages=699\u2013711|doi=10.2307/2025079}}</ref> For instance, the terms ''rantans'' or ''[[Jabberwocky|brillig]]'' have no intension and hence no meaning. Such terms may be suggestive, but a term can be ''suggestive'' without being meaningful. For instance, ''ran tan'' is an archaic onomatopoeia for chaotic noise or din and may suggest to English speakers a din or meaningless noise, and ''brillig'' though made up by [[Lewis Caroll]] may be suggestive of 'brilliant' or 'frigid'. Such terms, it may be argued, are always intensional since they connote the property 'meaningless term', but this is only an apparent paradox and does not constitute a counterexample to the claim that without intension a word has no meaning.  Part of its intension is that it has no extension.  Intension is analogous to the signified in the Saussurean system, [[Extension (semantics)|extension]] to the referent.\n\nIn philosophical arguments about [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] versus [[monism]], it is noted that thoughts have intensionality and physical objects do not (S. E. Palmer, 1999), but rather have extension in space and time.\n\n==Statement forms==\n\nA statement-form is simply a form obtained by putting blanks into a sentence where one or more expressions with extensions occur\u2014for instance, \"The quick brown ___ jumped over the lazy ___'s back.\" An instance of the form is a statement obtained by filling the blanks in.\n\n=== Intensional statement form ===\n\nAn ''intensional statement-form'' is a statement-form with at least one instance such that substituting co-extensive expressions into it does not always preserve [[logical value]]. An ''intensional statement'' is a statement that is an instance of an intensional statement-form. Here co-extensive expressions are expressions with the same [[extension (semantics)|extension]].\n\nThat is, a statement-form is intensional if it has, as one of its instances, a statement for which there are two co-extensive expressions (in the relevant language) such that one of them occurs in the statement, and if the other one is put in its place (uniformly, so that it replaces the former expression wherever it occurs in the statement), the result is a (different) statement with a different logical value. An intensional statement, then, is an instance of such a form; it has the same form as a statement in which substitution of co-extensive terms fails to preserve logical value.\n\n==== Examples ====\n#Everyone who has read ''Huckleberry Finn'' knows that Mark Twain wrote it.\n#It is possible that Aristotle did not tutor Alexander the Great.\n#Aristotle was pleased that he had a sister.\n\nTo see that these are intensional, make the following substitutions: (1) \"Mark Twain\" \u2192 \"The author of 'Corn-pone Opinions'\"; (2) \"Aristotle\" \u2192 \"the tutor of Alexander the Great\"; (3) can be seen to be intensional given \"had a sister\" \u2192 \"had a female sibling.\"\n\nIt will be noted that the intensional statements above feature expressions like \"knows\", \"possible\", and \"pleased\". Such expressions always, or nearly always, produce intensional statements when added (in some intelligible manner) to an extensional statement, and thus they (or more complex expressions like \"It is possible that\") are sometimes called ''intensional operators''. A large class of intensional statements, but by no means all, can be spotted from the fact that they contain intensional operators.\n\n=== Extensional statement form ===\n\nAn ''extensional'' statement is a non-intensional statement. Substitution of co-extensive expressions into it always preserves logical value. A language is intensional if it contains intensional statements, and extensional otherwise. All natural languages are intensional.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The only extensional languages are artificially constructed languages used in [[mathematical logic]] or for other special purposes and small fragments of natural languages.\n\n==== Examples ====\n#Mark Twain wrote ''Huckleberry Finn''.\n#Aristotle had a sister.\n\nNote that if \"Samuel Clemens\" is put into (1) in place of \"Mark Twain\", the result is as true as the original statement. It should be clear that no matter what is put for \"Mark Twain\", so long as it is a singular term picking out the same man, the statement remains true. Likewise, we can put in place of the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] any other predicate belonging to Mark Twain and only to Mark Twain, without changing the logical value. For (2), likewise, consider the following substitutions: \"Aristotle\" \u2192 \"The tutor of Alexander the Great\"; \"Aristotle\" \u2192 \"The author of the 'Prior Analytics'\"; \"had a sister\" \u2192 \"had a sibling with two X-chromosomes\"; \"had a sister\" \u2192 \"had a parent who had a non-male child\".\n\n=== Significance ===\nIntensional languages cannot be given an adequate [[semantics]] in terms of the extensions of expressions in them, since the extensions themselves do not suffice to determine a logical value.  (If they did, then one could not change the logical value by substituting co-extensive expressions.)  On the other hand, for the first half of the 20th century the only known systems of formal semantics worked by assigning extensions to expressions and used a [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]-style truth-definition of statements constructed from the primitive expressions of the language under analysis.  Hence, these semantical methods were pathetically inadequate for understanding the semantics of any but a few small artificial languages or mutilated fragments of natural languages.\n\nThis situation changed in the 1960s with the invention of possible-world or \"intensional\" semantics, the main form of which is due to [[Saul Kripke]]. Though this has enabled improvements in the semantic modelling of natural languages, much work remains to be done.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Description logic]]\n* [[Extension (predicate logic)]]\n* [[Extensionality]]\n* [[Intensional definition]]\n* [[Intensional logic]]\n* [[Set-builder notation]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]''.

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction in 1952, co-authoring a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and the first-season episode \"[[Datalore]]\" called the positronic brain \"Asimov's dream\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Science fiction ===\n{{quote|I began as a science fiction writer, and for the first eleven years of my literary career I wrote nothing but science fiction stories<!-- Original quote has no period here -->|Asimov, 1972<ref name=\"earlyyears1\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/n11/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last= Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, New York |page= 1}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:GXY5101 0000fc.jpg|thumb|right|The first installment of Asimov's ''Tyrann'' was the cover story in the fourth issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1951.

His first published work was a humorous item on the birth of his brother for Boys High School's literary journal in 1934. In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" (now lost), that year. On 17 May 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Asimov visited its publisher [[Street & Smith Publications]]. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on 19 June 1938 and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949;{{r|earlyyears560_564}} Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford, England]] |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |pages=12\u201313, 20}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, \"[[The Callistan Menace|Stowaway]]\".

In 1968 the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] voted \"[[Nightfall (Asimov short story)|Nightfall]]\" the best science fiction short story ever written.<ref name=\"earlyyears335_339\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/334/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=335\u2013339}}</ref><ref name=obit /> In ''[[Nightfall and Other Stories]]'' Asimov wrote, \"The writing of 'Nightfall' was a watershed in my professional career.....

Asimov expected to make chemistry his career, and was paid $2,600 annually at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, enough to marry his girlfriend; he did not expect to make much more from writing than the $1,788.50 he had earned from 28 stories sold over four years.

They promulgated a set of rules of [[ethics]] for robots (see [[Three Laws of Robotics]]) and intelligent machines that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject. Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) that he was largely inspired by the almost relentless tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a [[Frankenstein]] plot in which they destroyed their creators.\n\nThe robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977, [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote a screenplay of ''I, Robot'' that Asimov hoped would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile [[science fiction film]] ever made\". The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994. The 2004 movie ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', starring [[Will Smith]], was based on an unrelated script by [[Jeff Vintar]] titled ''Hardwired'', with Asimov's ideas incorporated later after the rights to Asimov's title were acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/bottom/56.html |title=The Bottom of Things |first=Michael |last=Sampson |date=January 14, 2004 |accessdate=January 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212180512/http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/bottom/56.html |archivedate=February 12, 2007 |df= }}</ref> (The title was not original to Asimov but had previously been used for [[I, Robot (short story)|a story]] by [[Eando Binder]].)

At the time, Asimov was preparing his own doctoral [[dissertation]], and for the oral examination to follow that. Fearing a prejudicial reaction from his graduate school evaluation board at [[Columbia University]], Asimov asked his editor that it be released under a pseudonym, yet it appeared under his own name. Asimov grew concerned at the scrutiny he would receive at his oral examination, in case the examiners thought he wasn't taking science seriously. At the end of the examination, one evaluator turned to him, smiling, and said, \"What can you tell us, Mr. Asimov, about the thermodynamic properties of the compound known as thiotimoline\".

McCartney had a vague idea for the plot and a small scrap of dialogue; he wished to make a film about a rock band whose members discover they are being impersonated by a group of extraterrestrials. The band and their impostors would likely be played by McCartney's group [[Wings (band)|Wings]], then at the height of their career. Intrigued by the idea, although he was not generally a fan of rock music, Asimov quickly produced a \"treatment\" or brief outline of the story. He adhered to McCartney's overall idea, producing a story he felt to be moving and dramatic. However, he did not make use of McCartney's brief scrap of dialogue, and probably as a consequence, McCartney rejected the story. The treatment now exists only in the Boston University archives.<ref>Asimov, I.

It was first introduced in the five short stories (1942\u20131944) which would later be collected as the 1951 novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Psychohistory |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=4\u20138 |publisher=Davis Publications |date=July 1988 |issn=0162-2188}}</ref> Somewhat later, the term \"[[psychohistory]]\" was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history.\n\n=== Other writings ===\nIn addition to his interest in science, Asimov was interested in history. Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, including ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Greeks: A Great Adventure |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1965 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Republic'' (1966),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Republic |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1966 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Empire'' (1967),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Egyptians'' (1967)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Egyptians |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968),\n<ref>{{cite book |title=The Near East: 10,000 Years of History |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1968 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> and ''[[Asimov's Chronology of the World]]'' (1991).<ref>{{cite book |title=Asimov's Chronology of the World |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1991 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nHe published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes\u2014covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969\u2014and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970), ''Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost'' (1974), and ''The Annotated Gulliver's Travels'' (1980).<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' chapter 112</ref>\n\nAsimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''. He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii\u2013xiii |nopp=true |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\">{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1971 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn=0-395-12665-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\">{{cite book |title=Asimov Laughs Again |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=0-06-016826-9}}</ref>\n\nParticularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'' (by \"J\") and ''[[The Sensuous Man]]'' (by \"M\"), Asimov published ''The Sensuous Dirty Old Man'' under the byline \"Dr. 'A{{'\"}}<ref>''In Joy Still Felt'' p. 569</ref> (although his full name was printed on the paperback edition, first published 1972).

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek's'' scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar.

I'll write as I please and let the critics do the analyzing.|Asimov, 1973{{r|asimov1973}}}}\n\n=== Characteristics ===\nAsimov wrote a typed first draft composed at the keyboard. He imagined an ending first, then a beginning, then \"let everything in-between work itself out as I come to it\". (Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes. After disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent..... The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp.222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories. See ''In Memory Yet Green'' for details of that time period.) Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of \"kyrt\"</ref> Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. Asimov's tendency to contort his timelines is perhaps most apparent in his later novel ''Nemesis'', in which one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novella \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book |title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=109\u2013138}}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author. The answer is, \"Not necessarily\u2014\" And yet one ought to add another short phrase \"\u2014but usually.\"|Asimov, 1969<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/nightfallotherst00asim#page/164/mode/2up|title=Nightfall, and other stories|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|pages=165}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Religion ===\nIsaac Asimov was an [[Atheism|atheist]], a [[Humanism|humanist]], and a [[Rationalism|rationalist]].<ref name=\"Popper\">Isaac Asimov, \"The Way of Reason\", in ''In Pursuit of Truth: Essays on the Philosophy of Karl Popper on the Occasion of his 80th Birthday,,'' ed.

During his childhood, his father and mother observed [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] traditions, though not as stringently as they had in Petrovichi; they did not, however, force their beliefs upon young Isaac. Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I. Asimov: A Memoir |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=Bantam |location=New York |isbn=0-553-56997-X |pages=11\u201314}}</ref> When he was 13, he chose not to have a [[bar mitzvah]].<ref>''In Memory Yet Green'', p. 121</ref> As his books ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' and ''Asimov Laughs Again'' record, Asimov was willing to tell jokes involving God, [[Satan]], the [[Garden of Eden]], [[Jerusalem]], and other religious topics, expressing the viewpoint that a good joke can do more to provoke thought than hours of philosophical discussion.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\"/><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\"/>\n\nFor a brief while, his father worked in the local synagogue to enjoy the familiar surroundings and, as Isaac put it, \"shine as a learned scholar\"<ref>Asimov, Isaac. ''In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920\u20131954''. Doubleday, 1979.</ref> versed in the sacred writings. This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8. Davis Publishing, 1991.</ref>\n\nWhen asked in an interview in 1982 if he was an atheist, Asimov replied,\n\n{{quote|I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally I am an atheist. I don't have the evidence to prove that God doesn't exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn't that I don't want to waste my time.<ref>Isaac Asimov on Science and the Bible (Free Inquiry&nbsp;\u2013 Spring 1982)</ref>}}\nLikewise he said about religious education: \"I would not be satisfied to have my kids choose to be religious without trying to argue them out of it, just as I would not be satisfied to have them decide to smoke regularly or engage in any other practice I consider detrimental to mind or body.\"<ref>{{Cite web |publisher=Corvallis Secular Society |year=1997 |title=Isaac Asimov on religion |url=http://css.peak.org/newsletter/1997/aug97/asimov.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127124434/http://css.peak.org/newsletter/1997/aug97/asimov.html |archivedate=November 27, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn his last volume of autobiography, Asimov wrote,\n\n{{quote|If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

An unsympathetic reader might think that I am \"burlesquing\" Christianity, but I am not. Then too, it is impossible to write science fiction and really ignore religion.<ref>{{cite book |first=Isaac |last=Asimov |title=Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection |year=1995 |pages=297\u2013302}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Politics ===\nAsimov became a staunch supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] during the [[New Deal]], and thereafter remained a political [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]]. He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, New York |isbn=0-385-15544-1}}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign. Asimov was dismayed over the pardon extended to Nixon by [[Gerald Ford|his successor]]: \"I was not impressed by the argument that it has spared the nation an ordeal.

''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing. You have to set up, you have to set up times for each person, you have to bang at the door, aren't you through yet, and so on. And in the same way, democracy cannot survive overpopulation.

I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}} The feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/books/isaac-asimov-faq/part3/ |title=Isaac Asimov FAQ, Part 3, 5.5 |date=February 9, 2001 |accessdate=January 17, 2007}}</ref> Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model. In my opinion, her mysteries are the best ever written, far better than the Sherlock Holmes stories, and [[Hercule Poirot]] is the best detective fiction has seen. Why should I not use as my model what I consider the best?\"<ref>''I.

Each province has its own legislature (''Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah'', DPRD) and an elected governor. The provinces are subdivided into regencies (''[[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|kabupaten]]'') and cities (''[[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|kota]]''), led by regents (''bupati'') and mayors (''walikota'') respectively and also their own legislature (''DPRD Kabupaten/Kota''). These are further subdivided into [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan'' or ''distrik'' in [[Western New Guinea|Papua]]), and again into administrative villages (either ''desa'', ''kelurahan'', ''kampung'', ''nagari'' in West Sumatra, or ''gampong'' in Aceh). This number has evolved over time, the most recent change being the split of [[North Kalimantan]] from [[East Kalimantan]] in October 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/house-agrees-on-creation-of-indonesias-34th-province-north-kalimantan/|title=House Agrees on Creation of Indonesia's 34th Province: 'North Kalimantan'|publisher=The Jakarta Globe|date=22 October 2012|accessdate=16 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816153022/http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/house-agrees-on-creation-of-indonesias-34th-province-north-kalimantan/|archivedate=16 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe village is the lowest level of government administration. Furthermore, it is divided into several community groups (''rukun warga'', RW) which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (''rukun tetangga'', RT). In Java, the village (''desa'') is divided further into smaller units called ''dusun'' or ''dukuh'' (hamlets), these units are the same as RW. Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, the regencies and cities have become key administrative units, responsible for providing most government services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen's daily life and handles matters of a village or neighbourhood through an elected village chief (''lurah'' or ''kepala desa'').\n\n[[Aceh]], [[Jakarta]], [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]], [[Papua (province)|Papua]], and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces.

North of [[50th parallel south|50\u00b0 south latitude]], 86% of the main basin is covered by [[pelagic]] sediments, of which more than half is [[globigerina]] ooze. The remaining 14% is layered with [[terrigenous]] sediments. Glacial outwash dominates the extreme southern latitudes.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe major choke points include [[Bab el Mandeb]], [[Strait of Hormuz]], the [[Lombok Strait]], the [[Strait of Malacca]] and the [[Palk Strait]].

Strong north-east winds blow from October until April; from May until October south and west winds prevail. In the Arabian Sea the violent Monsoon brings rain to the Indian subcontinent. In the southern hemisphere, the winds are generally milder, but summer storms near Mauritius can be severe. When the monsoon winds change, cyclones sometimes strike the shores of the Arabian Sea and the [[Bay of Bengal]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe Indian Ocean is the warmest ocean in the world.

Research indicates that human induced [[greenhouse warming]], and changes in the frequency and magnitude of [[El Ni\u00f1o]] events are a trigger to this strong warming in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Oceanography==\n{{unsourced|section|date=April 2018}}\nAmong the few large rivers flowing into the Indian Ocean are the [[Zambezi]], [[Shatt al-Arab]], [[Indus River|Indus]], [[Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]],  [[Narmada]], [[Ganges River|Ganges]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]]. The ocean's [[Ocean current|currents]] are mainly controlled by the monsoon. Two large [[gyre]]s, one in the northern hemisphere flowing clockwise and one south of the equator moving anticlockwise (including the [[Agulhas Current]] and [[Agulhas Return Current]]), constitute the dominant flow pattern. During the winter monsoon, however, currents in the north are reversed.\n\nDeep water circulation is controlled primarily by inflows from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Red Sea]], and Antarctic currents. North of [[20th parallel south|20\u00b0 south latitude]] the minimum surface temperature is {{convert|22|C}}, exceeding {{convert|28|C}} to the east. Southward of [[40th parallel south|40\u00b0 south latitude]], temperatures drop quickly.\n\nPrecipitation and evaporation leads to [[salinity]] variation in all oceans, and in the Indian Ocean salinity variations are driven by: (1) river inflow mainly from the [[Bay of Bengal]], (2) fresher water from the [[Indonesian Throughflow]]; and (3) saltier water from the [[Red Sea]] and [[Persian Gulf]].<ref name=Han/>\nSurface water salinity ranges from 32 to 37 parts per 1000, the highest occurring in the Arabian Sea and in a belt between southern Africa and south-western Australia. Pack ice and icebergs are found throughout the year south of about [[65th parallel south|65\u00b0 south latitude]]. The average northern limit of icebergs is [[45th parallel south|45\u00b0 south latitude]].\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Indian Ocean bathymetry srtm.png|thumb|[[Bathymetry|Bathymetric]] map of the Indian Ocean]]\n{{Main category|Landforms of the Indian Ocean}}\nAs the youngest of the major oceans,<ref name=Stow/> the Indian Ocean has active spreading ridges that are part of the worldwide system of [[mid-ocean ridge]]s.  In the Indian Ocean these spreading ridges meet at the [[Rodrigues Triple Point]] with the [[Central Indian Ridge]], including the [[Carlsberg Ridge]], separating the [[African Plate]] from the [[Indian Plate]]; the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]] separating the African Plate from the [[Antarctic Plate]]; and the [[Southeast Indian Ridge]] separating the [[Australian Plate]] from the [[Antarctic Plate]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The [[Central Indian Ridge|Central]] Ridge runs north on the in-between across of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Africa]] into the [[Mediterranean Sea]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nA series of ridges and [[seamount chain]]s produced by [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] pass over the Indian Ocean.  The [[R\u00e9union hotspot]] (active 70\u201340 million years ago) connects [[R\u00e9union]] and the [[Mascarene Plateau]] to the [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge]] and the [[Deccan Traps]] in north-western India; the [[Kerguelen hotspot]] (100\u201335 million years ago) connects the [[Kerguelen Islands]] and [[Kerguelen Plateau]] to the [[Ninety East Ridge]] and the [[Rajmahal Traps]] in north-eastern India; the Marion hotspot (100\u201370 million years ago) possibly connects [[Prince Edward Islands]] to the [[Eighty Five East Ridge]].<ref name=Muller/> These hotspot tracks have been broken by the still active spreading ridges mentioned above.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Marine life==\nAmong the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of [[phytoplankton]] blooms in summer, due to the strong [[monsoon]] winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean [[upwelling]], which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable [[tuna]] catch.<ref name=\"FAO-2016\"/> Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from [[Russia]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]] also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for [[shrimp]] and tuna.<ref name=\"CIAWFB-1994\"/>\n\nResearch indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.<ref name=\"Roxy-2016\" />\n\nEndangered marine species include the [[dugong]], [[seal (mammal)|seals]], [[turtle]]s, and [[whale]]s.<ref name=\"CIAWFB-1994\" />\n\nAn [[Indian Ocean garbage patch]] was discovered in 2010 covering at least {{Convert|5|e6km2|abbr=off}}. Riding the southern [[Indian Ocean Gyre]], this vortex of [[Plastic pollution|plastic garbage]] constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the [[Mozambique Channel]], and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2016, UK researchers from [[Southampton University]] identified six new animal species at [[hydrothermal vents]] beneath the Indian Ocean. These new species were a \"Hoff\" crab, a \"giant peltospirid\" snail, a whelk-like snail, a limpet, a scaleworm and a polychaete worm.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-38305989 |title=New marine life found in deep sea vents |date=15 December 2016 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The economically important [[Silk Road]] was blocked from Europe by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in {{circa}} 1453 with the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Civilizations soon arose in [[Iran|Persia]] (beginning with [[Elam]]) and later in [[Southeast Asia]] (beginning with [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nDuring [[Egypt]]'s first dynasty ({{circa}} 3000&nbsp;BCE), sailors were sent out onto its waters, journeying to [[Punt (region)|Punt]], thought to be part of present-day [[Somalia]]. Returning ships brought gold and myrrh. The earliest known maritime trade between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley (c. 2500 BC) was conducted along the Indian Ocean. [[Phoenicia]]ns of the late 3rd millennium BCE may have entered the area, but no settlements resulted.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe Indian Ocean's relatively calmer waters opened the areas bordering it to trade earlier than the Atlantic or [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans. The powerful monsoons also meant ships could easily sail west early in the season, then wait a few months and return eastwards.

Like the Indonesian peoples above, the western sailors used the monsoon to cross the ocean. The unknown author of the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' describes this route, as well as the commodities that were traded along various commercial ports on the coasts of the Horn of Africa and India circa 1&nbsp;CE. Among these trading settlements were [[Mosylon]] and [[Opone]] on the Red Sea littoral.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nUnlike the Pacific Ocean where the civilization of the [[Polynesians]] reached most of the far flung islands and atolls and populated them, almost all the islands, archipelagos and atolls of the Indian Ocean were uninhabited until colonial times.

The European ships, armed with heavy cannon, quickly dominated trade. [[Portugal]] achieved pre-eminence by setting up forts at the important straits and ports. Their hegemony along the coasts of Africa and Asia lasted until the mid 17th century. Later, the Portuguese were challenged by other European powers. The [[Dutch East India Company]] (1602\u20131798) sought control of trade with the East across the Indian Ocean. [[France]] and Britain established trade companies for the area. From 1565 [[Spain]] established a major trading operation with the [[Manila Galleons]] in the [[Philippines]] and the [[Spanish East Indies|Pacific]]. Spanish trading ships purposely avoided the Indian Ocean, following the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] with Portugal. By 1815, Britain became the principal power in the Indian Ocean.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Industrial era===\nThe opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 revived European interest in the East, but no nation was successful in establishing trade dominance.
