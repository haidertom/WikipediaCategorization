It began as a philosophical concept in ancient Greece and entered the scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of atoms.\n\nThe word ''atom'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] adjective ''atomos'', meaning \"indivisible\".<ref name=\"SEP\">Berryman, Sylvia, \"Ancient Atomism\", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/atomism-ancient/]</ref> 19th century chemists began using the term in connection with the growing number of irreducible chemical elements. Around the turn of the 20th century, through various experiments with [[electromagnetism]] and [[radioactivity]], physicists discovered that the so-called \"uncuttable atom\" was actually a conglomerate of various [[subatomic particle]]s (chiefly, [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) which can exist separately from each other. In fact, in certain extreme environments, such as [[neutron star]]s, extreme temperature and pressure prevents atoms from existing at all.\n\nSince atoms were found to be divisible, physicists later invented the term \"[[elementary particle]]s\" to describe the \"uncuttable\", though not indestructible, parts of an atom. The field of science which studies subatomic particles is [[particle physics]], and it is in this field that physicists hope to discover the true fundamental nature of matter.\n\n==History==\n\n===Philosophical atomism===\n{{main|Atomism}}\nThe idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old idea, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India.

The first was the [[conservation of mass|law of conservation of mass]], closely associated with the work of [[Antoine Lavoisier]], which states that the total mass in a chemical reaction remains constant (that is, the reactants have the same mass as the products).<ref name=\"Lavoisier\">{{cite web|author=Weisstein, Eric W. |url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Lavoisier.html |title=Lavoisier, Antoine (1743-1794) |publisher=scienceworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=2009-08-01}}</ref> The second was the [[law of definite proportions]]. First established by the French chemist [[Joseph Louis Proust]] in 1799,<ref name=\"proust\">Proust, Joseph Louis. \"[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/proust.html Researches on Copper]\", excerpted from ''Ann. chim.'' 32, 26-54 (1799) [as translated and reproduced in Henry M. Leicester and Herbert S. Klickstein, ''A Source Book in Chemistry'', 1400\u20131900 (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard, 1952)]. Retrieved on August 29, 2007.</ref> this law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent chemical elements, then the masses of the constituents will always have the same proportions by weight, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance.\n\n[[John Dalton]] studied and expanded upon this previous work and defended a new idea, later known as the [[law of multiple proportions]]: if the same two elements can be combined to form a number of different compounds, then the ratios of the masses of the two elements in their various compounds will be represented by small whole numbers.  For example, Proust had studied [[tin oxide (disambiguation)|tin oxide]]s and found that there is one type of tin oxide that is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and another type that is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (these are [[tin(II) oxide]] and [[tin dioxide]] respectively). Dalton noted from these percentages that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen; 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2. Dalton found several examples of such instances of integral multiple combining proportions, and asserted that the pattern was a general one.  Most importantly, he noted that an atomic theory of matter could elegantly explain this law, as well as Proust's law of definite proportions. For example, in the case of Proust's tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms to form either the first or the second oxide of tin.<ref name=\"From AtomosToAtom\">{{cite book|author=Andrew G. van Melsen |year=1952 |title=From Atomos to Atom |isbn= 978-0-486-49584-2 |publisher=Dover Publications |p=137}}</ref>\n\nDalton believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbed different gases in different proportions - for example, he found that water absorbed [[carbon dioxide]] far better than it absorbed [[nitrogen]].<ref name = \"Dalton_1803_paper\">Dalton, John. \"[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/dalton52.html On the Absorption of Gases by Water and Other Liquids]\", in ''Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester''. 1803. Retrieved on August 29, 2007.</ref> Dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences in mass and complexity of the gases' respective particles. Indeed, carbon dioxide molecules (CO<sub>2</sub>) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N<sub>2</sub>).\n\nDalton proposed that each chemical element is composed of atoms of a single, unique type, and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means, they can combine to form more complex structures ([[chemical compound]]s). This marked the first truly scientific theory of the atom, since Dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination of the results in an empirical fashion.\n\n[[File:Daltons symbols.gif|right|thumb|Various atoms and molecules as depicted in [[John Dalton]]'s ''A New System of Chemical Philosophy'' (1808).]]\nIn 1803 Dalton orally presented his first list of relative atomic weights for a number of substances. This paper was published in 1805, but he did not discuss there exactly how he obtained these figures.<ref name = \"Dalton_1803_paper\"/> The method was first revealed in 1807 by his acquaintance [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]], in the third edition of Thomson's textbook, ''A System of Chemistry''. Finally, Dalton published a full account in his own textbook, ''A New System of Chemical Philosophy'', 1808 and 1810.\n\nDalton estimated the atomic weights according to the mass ratios in which they combined, with the hydrogen atom taken as unity. However, Dalton did not conceive that with some elements atoms exist in molecules\u2014e.g. pure oxygen exists as O<sub>2</sub>. He also mistakenly believed that the simplest compound between any two elements is always one atom of each (so he thought water was HO, not H<sub>2</sub>O).<ref>{{cite news|author=Johnson, Chris |url=http://www.bulldog.u-net.com/avogadro/avoga.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020710224229/http://www.bulldog.u-net.com/avogadro/avoga.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-07-10 |title=Avogadro - his contribution to chemistry |accessdate=2009-08-01 }}</ref> This, in addition to the crudity of his equipment, flawed his results. For instance, in 1803 he believed that oxygen atoms were 5.5 times heavier than hydrogen atoms, because in water he measured 5.5&nbsp;grams of oxygen for every 1&nbsp;gram of hydrogen and believed the formula for water was HO.  Adopting better data, in 1806 he concluded that the atomic weight of oxygen must actually be 7 rather than 5.5, and he retained this weight for the rest of his life.  Others at this time had already concluded that the oxygen atom must weigh 8 relative to hydrogen equals 1, if one assumes Dalton's formula for the water molecule (HO), or 16 if one assumes the modern water formula (H<sub>2</sub>O).<ref name=\"Chemical Atomism in the Nineteenth Century\">{{cite book|author=Alan J. Rocke |year=1984 |title=Chemical Atomism in the Nineteenth Century |publisher=Ohio State University Press |location=Columbus}}</ref>\n\n===Avogadro===\nThe flaw in Dalton's theory was corrected in principle in 1811 by [[Amedeo Avogadro]]. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain equal numbers of molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles does not affect the volume that it occupies).<ref name=\"avogadro\">{{cite journal|author=Avogadro, Amedeo|url=http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/avogadro.html |title=Essay on a Manner of Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies, and the Proportions in Which They Enter into These Compounds|year=1811 |journal=Journal de Physique|volume=73|pages=58\u201376}}</ref> [[Avogadro's law]] allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms.\n\n===Brownian Motion===\nIn 1827, the British botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] observed that dust particles inside pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about for no apparent reason. In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] theorized that this [[Brownian motion]] was caused by the water molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a hypothetical mathematical model to describe it.<ref name=\"einstein\">{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=A.|title=\u00dcber die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der W\u00e4rme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Fl\u00fcssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=322|pages=549\u2013560|year=1905|doi=10.1002/andp.19053220806|bibcode = 1905AnP...322..549E|issue=8 |hdl=10915/2785}}</ref> This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist [[Jean Perrin]], thus providing additional validation for particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).\n\n===Discovery of subatomic particles===\n{{Main|Electron|Plum pudding model}}\n{{multiple image\n  |direction = horizontal\n  |align     = right\n  |width     = 300\n  |footer    =\n  |image1    = JJ_Thomson_Crookes_Tube_Replica.jpg\n  |alt1      =\n  |caption1  = \n  |image2    = JJ Thomson Cathode Ray 2 explained.svg\n  |alt2      =\n  |caption2  = The cathode rays (blue) were emitted from the cathode, sharpened to a beam by the slits, then deflected as they passed between the two electrified plates.\n}}\n\nAtoms were thought to be the smallest possible division of matter until 1897 when [[J.J.

He concluded that these rays, rather than being a form of light, were composed of very light [[electric charge|negatively charged]] particles he called \"[[corpuscularianism|corpuscles]]\" (they would later be renamed electrons by other scientists).  He measured the mass-to-charge ratio and discovered it was 1800 times smaller than that of hydrogen, the smallest atom.

To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.\n\nThis led Rutherford to propose a [[Rutherford model|planetary model]] in which a cloud of electrons surrounded a small, compact nucleus of positive charge. Only such a concentration of charge could produce the electric field strong enough to cause the heavy deflection.<ref name=\"rutherford\">{{cite journal|author=Rutherford, Ernest|title=The Scattering of \u03b1 and \u03b2 Particles by Matter and the Structure of the Atom|journal=Philosophical Magazine|year=1911|volume=21|page=669|url=http://www.ffn.ub.es/luisnavarro/nuevo_maletin/Rutherford%20(1911),%20Structure%20atom%20.pdf|bibcode=2012PMag...92..379R|doi=10.1080/14786435.2011.617037|issue=4}}</ref>\n\n===First steps toward a quantum physical model of the atom===\n{{Main|Bohr model}}\nThe planetary model of the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating [[electric charge]] is known to emit [[electromagnetic wave]]s according to the [[Larmor formula]] in [[classical electromagnetism]]. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in a small fraction of a second. The second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked [[Emission spectrum|emission]] and [[Absorption spectrum|absorption spectra]] of atoms that were observed.\n\n[[File:Bohr atom animation 2.gif|thumb|right|The [[Bohr model]] of the atom]] \n[[Quantum mechanics|Quantum theory]] revolutionized physics at the beginning of the 20th century, when [[Max Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein]] postulated that light energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete amounts known as [[Quantum|quanta]] (singular, ''quantum''). In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] incorporated this idea into his [[Bohr model]] of the atom, in which an electron could only orbit the nucleus in particular circular orbits with fixed [[angular momentum]] and energy, its distance from the nucleus (i.e., their radii) being proportional to its energy.<ref name=\"NBohr\">{{cite journal|author=Bohr, Niels|title=On the constitution of atoms and molecules|url=http://www.ffn.ub.es/luisnavarro/nuevo_maletin/Bohr_1913.pdf|journal=Philosophical Magazine|year=1913|volume=26|pages=476\u2013502|doi=10.1080/14786441308634993|issue=153 }}</ref> Under this model an electron could not spiral into the nucleus because it could not lose energy in a continuous manner; instead, it could only make instantaneous \"[[Atomic electron transition|quantum leap]]s\" between the fixed [[energy level]]s.<ref name=\"NBohr\"/> When this occurred, light was emitted or absorbed at a frequency proportional to the change in energy (hence the absorption and emission of light in discrete spectra).<ref name=\"NBohr\"/>\n\nBohr's model was not perfect. It could only predict the [[spectral line]]s of hydrogen; it couldn't predict those of multielectron atoms. Worse still, as [[Spectrophotometry|spectrographic technology]] improved, additional spectral lines in hydrogen were observed which Bohr's model couldn't explain. In 1916, [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] added elliptical orbits to the Bohr model to explain the extra emission lines, but this made the model very difficult to use, and it still couldn't explain more complex atoms.\n\n===Discovery of isotopes===\n{{Main|Isotope}}\nWhile experimenting with the products of [[radioactive decay]], in 1913 [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Frederick Soddy]] discovered that there appeared to be more than one element at each position on the [[periodic table]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1921/soddy-bio.html\n|title=Frederick Soddy, The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1921 \n|publisher=Nobel Foundation \n|accessdate=2008-01-18\n}}</ref> The term [[isotope]] was coined by [[Margaret Todd (doctor)|Margaret Todd]] as a suitable name for these elements.\n\nThat same year, [[J.J. Thomson]] conducted an experiment in which he channeled a stream of [[neon]] [[ion]]s through magnetic and electric fields, striking a photographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the plate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was because some of the neon ions had a different mass.<ref name=\"thompson3\">{{cite journal|author=Thomson, J.J. |url=http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/canal.html | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1913.0057 |title=Rays of positive electricity|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|year=1913|volume=A 89|pages=1\u201320|bibcode = 1913RSPSA..89....1T|issue=607 }} [as excerpted in Henry A.

Rutherford concluded that the hydrogen nuclei emerged from the nuclei of the nitrogen atoms themselves (in effect, he had split a nitrogen).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rutherford, Ernest|url=http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/rutherford.html |title=Collisions of alpha Particles with Light Atoms.

This, coupled with the [[atomic mass]] of many elements being [[Prout's law|roughly equivalent]] to an integer number of hydrogen atoms - then assumed to be the lightest particles - led him to conclude that hydrogen nuclei were singular particles and a basic constituent of all atomic nuclei. He named such particles [[proton]]s. Further experimentation by Rutherford found that the nuclear mass of most atoms exceeded that of the protons it possessed; he speculated that this surplus mass was composed of previously-unknown neutrally charged particles, which were tentatively dubbed \"[[neutron]]s\".\n\nIn 1928, [[Walter Bothe]] observed that [[beryllium]] emitted a highly penetrating, electrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles. It was later discovered that this radiation could knock hydrogen atoms out of [[paraffin wax]]. Initially it was thought to be high-energy [[gamma radiation]], since gamma radiation had a similar effect on electrons in metals, but [[James Chadwick]] found that the [[ionization]] effect was too strong for it to be due to electromagnetic radiation, so long as energy and momentum were conserved in the interaction. In 1932, Chadwick exposed various elements, such as hydrogen and nitrogen, to the mysterious \"beryllium radiation\", and by measuring the energies of the recoiling charged particles, he deduced that the radiation was actually composed of electrically neutral particles which could not be massless like the gamma ray, but instead were required to have a mass similar to that of a proton. Chadwick now claimed these particles as Rutherford's neutrons.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chadwick, James|year=1932|url=http://web.mit.edu/22.54/resources/Chadwick.pdf |title=Possible Existence of a Neutron|doi=10.1038/129312a0|journal=Nature|page=312|volume=129|bibcode = 1932Natur.129Q.312C|issue=3252}}</ref> For his discovery of the neutron, Chadwick received the Nobel Prize in 1935.\n\n===Quantum physical models of the atom===\n{{Main|Atomic orbital}}\n[[File:S-p-Orbitals.svg|right|thumb|The five filled atomic orbitals of a neon atom separated and arranged in order of increasing energy from left to right, with the last three orbitals being [[Degenerate energy level|equal in energy]].

[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]], fascinated by this idea, explored whether or not the movement of an electron in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than as a particle.

The [[Atomic orbital model|modern model of the atom]] describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its [[atomic orbital]].

From 2012 to 2016 she was an [[member of parliament|MP]] for [[Kawhmu Township]] to the [[House of Representatives (Myanmar)|House of Representatives]].\n\nThe youngest daughter of [[Aung San]], [[Father of the Nation]] of modern-day Myanmar, and [[Khin Kyi]], Aung San Suu Kyi was born in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]]. After graduating from the [[University of Delhi]] in 1964 and the [[University of Oxford]] in 1968, she worked at the [[United Nations]] for three years. She married [[Michael Aris]] in 1972, with whom she had two children. Aung San Suu Kyi rose to prominence in the [[8888 Uprising|1988 Uprisings]], and became the General Secretary of the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD), which she had newly formed with the help of several retired army officials who criticized the military junta. In the [[Burmese general election, 1990|1990 elections]], NLD won 81% of the seats in Parliament, but the results were nullified, as the [[State Peace and Development Council|military]] refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. She had, however, already been detained under [[house arrest]] before the elections. She remained under house arrest for almost 15 of the 21 years from 1989 to 2010, becoming one of the world's most prominent [[political prisoner]]s.\n\nHer party boycotted the [[Myanmar general election, 2010|2010 elections]], resulting in a decisive victory for the military-backed [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]]. Aung San Suu Kyi became a [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] while her party won 43 of the 45 vacant seats in the [[Burmese by-elections, 2012|2012 by-elections]]. In the [[Myanmar general election, 2015|2015 elections]], her party won a [[landslide victory]], taking 86% of the seats in the [[Assembly of the Union]] \u2013 well more than the 67 percent [[supermajority]] needed to ensure that its preferred candidates were elected [[President of Myanmar|President]] and [[Vice President of Myanmar|Second Vice President]] in the [[Presidential Electoral College]]. Although she was prohibited from becoming the President due to a clause in [[Constitution of Myanmar|the constitution]] \u2013 her late husband and children are foreign citizens \u2013 she assumed the newly created role of [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]], a role akin to a [[Prime Minister of Myanmar|Prime Minister]] or a [[head of government]].

23, 1972) was a Polish-born American [[rabbi]] and one of the leading [[Judaism|Jewish]] theologians and Jewish philosophers of the 20th century. Heschel, a professor of [[Jewish mysticism]] at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], authored a number of widely read books on [[Jewish philosophy]] and was active in the [[civil rights movement]].<ref>[http://www.tikkun.org/nextgen/the-legacy-of-abraham-joshua-heschel \"The Legacy of Abraham Joshua Heschel.\"] ''Tikkun''.

Accessed May 25, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nAbraham Joshua Heschel was born in 1907 as the youngest of six children of Moshe Mordechai and Reizel Perlow. He was descended from preeminent European [[rabbi]]s on both sides of his family.<ref name=\"vzexea\"/> His paternal great-great-grandfather and namesake was [[Rebbe]] [[Avraham Yehoshua Heshel]] of [[Opat\u00f3w|Apt]] in present-day Poland. His mother was also a descendant of Avraham Yehoshua Heshel and other [[Hasidic dynasties]]. His siblings were Sarah, Dvora Miriam, Esther Sima, Gittel, and Jacob. Their father Moshe died of [[influenza]] in 1916 when Abraham was nine.\n\nAfter a traditional [[yeshiva]] education and studying for Orthodox rabbinical ordination [[semicha]], Heschel pursued his doctorate at the [[University of Berlin]] and a liberal rabbinic ordination at the [[Hochschule f\u00fcr die Wissenschaft des Judentums]]. There he studied under some of the finest Jewish educators of the time: [[Hanoch Albeck|Chanoch Albeck]], [[Ismar Elbogen]], [[Julius Guttmann]], and [[Leo Baeck]]. His mentor in Berlin was [[David Koigen]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=hAntzKMXVwkC&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=david+koigen+professor&source=bl&ots=MxVp4KblKF&sig=SX-FpbCZpriRHMQL6_oQDS0LKGU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjltaf5yZjPAhXkCMAKHVidBHEQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&q=david%20koigen%20professor&f=true Abraham Joshua Heschel: Prophetic Witness, Edward Kaplan]</ref> Heschel later taught [[Talmud]] at the Hochschule. He joined a [[Yiddish]] poetry group, Jung Vilna, and in 1933, published a volume of Yiddish poems, ''Der Shem Hamefoyrosh: Mentsch,'' dedicated to his father.<ref name=\"vzexea\">[http://home.versatel.nl/heschel/Susannah.htm Abraham Joshua Heschel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231326/http://home.versatel.nl/heschel/Susannah.htm |date=September 26, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn late October 1938, when Heschel was living in a rented room in the home of a Jewish family in [[Frankfurt]], he was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and deported to Poland. He spent ten months lecturing on [[Jewish philosophy]] and [[Torah]] at Warsaw's [[Institute for Jewish Studies]].<ref name = \"vzexea\"/> Six weeks before the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u201345)|German invasion of Poland]], Heschel left Warsaw for London with the help of [[Julian Morgenstern]], president of [[Hebrew Union College]], who had been working to obtain visas for Jewish scholars in Europe.<ref name = \"vzexea\"/>\n\nHeschel's sister Esther was killed in a German bombing. His mother was murdered by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], and two other sisters, Gittel and Devorah, died in [[Nazi concentration camps]]. He never returned to Germany, Austria or Poland. He once wrote, \"If I should go to Poland or Germany, every stone, every tree would remind me of contempt, hatred, murder, of children killed, of mothers burned alive, of human beings asphyxiated.\"<ref name = \"vzexea\"/>\n\nHeschel arrived in New York City in March 1940.<ref name = \"vzexea\"/> He served on the faculty of [[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), the main seminary of [[Reform Judaism]], in [[Cincinnati]] for five years. In 1946, he took a position at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTS) in New York City, the main seminary of [[Conservative Judaism]]. He served as professor of [[Jewish ethics]] and [[Kabbalah|Mysticism]] until his death in 1972.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nHeschel married Sylvia Straus, a concert pianist, on December 10, 1946, in Los Angeles. Their daughter, [[Susannah Heschel]], became a Jewish scholar in her own right.<ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20071122 Interview with Susannah Heschel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506000817/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20071122 |date=May 6, 2009 }}</ref> Heschel's papers are held in the [[Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library]] at [[Duke University]].<ref>[http://today.duke.edu/2012/08/heschel Duke to Acquire Papers of Rabbi Heschel, Influential Religious Leader], Duke University, August 2012</ref>\n\n==Ideology==\n[[File:SelmaHeschelMarch.jpg|thumb|Heschel (2nd from right) in the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma Civil Rights march]] with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] (4th from right). Heschel later wrote, \"When I marched in Selma, my feet were praying.\"]]\nHeschel explicated many facets of Jewish thought, including studies on medieval Jewish philosophy, [[Kabbalah]], and [[Hasidic philosophy]]. According to some scholars, he was more interested in spirituality than in critical text study; the latter was a specialty of many scholars at JTS. He was not given a graduate assistant for many years and was relegated to teach mainly in the education school or Rabbinical school, not in the academic graduate program. Heschel became friendly with his colleague [[Mordecai Kaplan]]. Though they differed in their approach to Judaism, they had a very cordial relationship and visited each other's homes from time to time.\n\nHeschel believed the teachings of the Hebrew prophets were a clarion call for social action in the United States and worked for African Americans' [[civil rights]] and against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dreier|first1=Peter|title='Selma's' Missing Rabbi|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-dreier/selmas-missing-rabbi_b_6491368.html/|accessdate=March 13, 2015|publisher=Huffington Post|date=January 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe also specifically criticized what he called \"pan-halakhism\", or an exclusive focus upon religiously compatible behavior to the neglect of the non-legalistic dimension of rabbinic tradition.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Influence outside Judaism===\n[[File:Abraham Heschel with MLK.jpg|thumb|Heschel, left, presenting the Judaism and World Peace Award to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], December 7, 1965]]\nHeschel is a widely read Jewish theologian whose most influential works include ''Man Is Not Alone'', ''God in Search of Man'', ''The Sabbath,'' and ''The Prophets''. At the [[Vatican Council II]], as representative of [[American Jews]], Heschel persuaded the [[Catholic Church]] to eliminate or modify passages in its liturgy that demeaned the Jews, or referred to an expected conversion to Christianity. His theological works argued that religious experience is a fundamentally human impulse, not just a Jewish one. He believed that no religious community could claim a monopoly on religious truth.<ref>{{cite book | last=Gillman | first=Neil | authorlink =Neil Gillman| title=Conservative Judaism: The New Century | year=1993 | publisher=Behrman House Inc. | page = 163 }}</ref>\n\n==Published works==\n\n===''The Sabbath'' (1951)===\n''The Sabbath: Its Meaning for Modern Man'' is a work on the nature and celebration of [[Shabbat]], the Jewish Sabbath. This work is rooted in the thesis that Judaism is a religion of time, not space, and that the Sabbath symbolizes the sanctification of time.\n\n===''Man Is Not Alone'' (1951)===\n''Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion'' offers Heschel's views on how people can comprehend God. Judaism views God as being radically different from humans, so Heschel explores the ways that Judaism teaches that a person may have an encounter with the ineffable. A recurring theme in this work is the radical amazement that people feel when experiencing the presence of the Divine. Heschel then goes on to explore the problems of doubts and faith; what Judaism means by teaching that God is one; the essence of humanity and the problem of human needs; the definition of religion in general and of Judaism in particular; and human yearning for spirituality. He offers his views as to Judaism being a pattern for life.\n\n===''God in Search of Man'' (1955)===\n''[[God in Search of Man|God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism]]'' is a companion volume to ''Man Is Not Alone''. In this book Heschel discusses the nature of religious thought, how thought becomes faith, and how faith creates responses in the believer. He discusses ways that people can seek God's presence, and the radical amazement that we receive in return. He offers a criticism of nature worship; a study of humanity's metaphysical loneliness, and his view that we can consider God to be in search of humanity. The first section concludes with a study of [[Jews as a chosen people]]. Section two deals with the idea of [[revelation]], and what it means for one to be a prophet. This section gives us his idea of revelation as an event, as opposed to a process. This relates to Israel's commitment to God. Section three discusses his views of how a Jew should understand the nature of Judaism as a religion. He discusses and rejects the idea that mere faith (without law) alone is enough, but then cautions against rabbis he sees as adding too many restrictions to Jewish law. He discusses the need to correlate ritual observance with spirituality and love, the importance of [[Kavanah]] (intention) when performing [[mitzvot]]. He engages in a discussion of religious behaviorism\u2014when people strive for external compliance with the law, yet disregard the importance of inner devotion.\n\n===''The Prophets'' (1962)===\nThis work started out as his PhD thesis in German, which he later expanded and translated into English. Originally published in a two-volume edition, this work studies the books of the Hebrew prophets. It covers their lives and the historical context that their missions were set in, summarizes their work, and discusses their psychological state. In it Heschel puts forward what would become a central idea in his theology: that the prophetic (and, ultimately, Jewish) view of God is best understood not as anthropomorphic (that God takes human form) but rather as anthropopathic\u2014that God has human feelings.\n\nIn his book ''The Prophets'', Abraham Joshua Heschel describes the unique aspect of the Jewish prophets as compared to other similar figures. Whereas other nations have soothsayers and diviners who attempt to discover the will of their gods, according to Heschel the Hebrew prophets are characterized by their experience of what he calls theotropism\u2014God turning towards humanity. Heschel argues for the view of Hebrew prophets as receivers of the \"Divine [[Pathos]]\", of the wrath and sorrow of God over his nation that has forsaken him. In this view, prophets do not speak for God so much as they remind their audience of God's voice for the voiceless, the poor and oppressed.\n\nHe writes:\n{{Quote|Prophecy is the voice that God has lent to the silent agony, a voice to the plundered poor, to the profane riches of the world. It is a form of living, a crossing point of God and man. God is raging in the prophet's words.<ref>''The Prophets Ch.&nbsp;1</ref>}}\n\n===''Torah min HaShamayim'' (1962)===\nMany consider Heschel's ''Torah min HaShamayim BeAspaklariya shel HaDorot'', (''Torah from Heaven in the mirror of the generations'') to be his masterwork. The three volumes of this work are a study of classical rabbinic theology and [[aggadah]], as opposed to [[halakha]] (Jewish law.) It explores the views of the rabbis in the [[Mishnah]], [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]] about the nature of [[Torah]], the revelation of God to mankind, prophecy, and the ways that Jews have used scriptural exegesis to expand and understand these core Jewish texts. In this work, Heschel views the 2nd century sages [[Rabbi Akiva]] and [[Ishmael ben Elisha]] as paradigms for the two dominant world-views in Jewish theology\n\nTwo Hebrew volumes were published during his lifetime by [[Soncino Press]], and the third Hebrew volume was published posthumously by JTS Press in the 1990s. An English translation of all three volumes, with notes, essays and appendices, was translated and edited by Rabbi [[Gordon Tucker]], entitled ''Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations''. In its own right it can be the subject of intense study and analysis, and provides insight into the relationship between God and Man beyond the world of Judaism and for all Monotheism.\n\n===''Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets'' (1966)===\nHeschel wrote a series of articles, originally in Hebrew, on the existence of prophecy in Judaism after the destruction of the Holy [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE. These essays were translated into English and published as ''Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets: Maimonides and Others'' by the American Judaica publisher [[KTAV Publishing House|Ktav]].\n\nThe publisher of this book states, \"The standard Jewish view is that prophecy ended with the ancient prophets, somewhere early in the Second Temple era. Heschel demonstrated that this view is not altogether accurate. Belief in the possibility of continued prophetic inspiration, and in its actual occurrence appear throughout much of the medieval period, and even in modern times. Heschel's work on prophetic inspiration in the Middle Ages originally appeared in two long Hebrew articles. In them he concentrated on the idea that prophetic inspiration was possible even in post-Talmudic times, and, indeed, had taken place at various times and in various schools, from the [[Geonim]] to [[Maimonides]] and beyond.\"\n\n==Commemoration==\n[[Image:AJ Heschel school 270 W89 jeh.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Abraham Joshua Heschel School]] in [[Manhattan]]]]\nFour schools have been named for Heschel, in the [[Upper West Side]] of New York City, [[Northridge, California]], [[Agoura Hills, California]], and [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. In 2009, a highway in Missouri was named \"Dr. Abraham Joshua Heschel Highway\" after a [[Springfield, Missouri]] area Neo-Nazi group cleaned the stretch of highway as part of an \"Adopt-A-Highway\" plan. Heschel's daughter, Susannah, has objected to the adoption of her father's name in this context.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/us/23heschel.html?ref=us | work=The New York Times | title=Daughter Against Use of Father's Name to Subvert Neo-Nazis | first=Michael | last=Cooper | date=June 23, 2009 | accessdate=March 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n* ''The Earth Is the Lord's: The Inner World of the Jew in Eastern Europe''. 1949. {{ISBN|1-879045-42-7}}\n* ''Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion''. 1951. {{ISBN|0-374-51328-7}}\n* ''The Sabbath: Its Meaning for Modern Man''. 1951. {{ISBN|1-59030-082-3}}\n* ''Man's Quest for God: Studies in Prayer and Symbolism''. 1954. {{ISBN|0-684-16829-4}}\n* ''God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism''. 1955. {{ISBN|0-374-51331-7}}\n* ''The Prophets''. 1962. {{ISBN|0-06-093699-1}}\n* ''Who Is Man?'' 1965. {{ISBN|0-8047-0266-7}}\n* ''Israel: An Echo of Eternity''. 1969. {{ISBN|1-879045-70-2}}\n* ''A Passion for Truth''. 1973. {{ISBN|1-879045-41-9}}\n* ''Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations''. 2005. {{ISBN|0-8264-0802-8}}\n* ''Torah min ha-shamayim be'aspaklariya shel ha-dorot; Theology of Ancient Judaism''.

It was created on 12 August 1980 by the '''1980 Montevideo Treaty''',<ref>[http://wits.worldbank.org/GPTAD/PDF/archive/LAIA-ALADI.pdf 1980 Montevideo Treaty] {{en icon}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aladi.org/nsfaladi/juridica.nsf/vtratadoweb/tm80 1980 Montevideo Treaty] {{es icon}}</ref> replacing the Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA / ALALC). Currently, it has 13 member countries, and any of the Latin American States may apply for accession.\n\n== Objectives ==\nThe development of the  integration process developed within the framework of the ALADI aims at promoting the harmonious and balanced socio-economic development of the region, and its long-term objective is the gradual and progressive establishment of a Latin-American [[Common Market]].\n\n== Basic Functions ==\n* Promotion and regulation of reciprocal trade\n* Economic complementation\n* Development of economic cooperation actions contributing to the markets extension.\n\n== General Principles ==\n* Pluralism in political and economic matters; \n* Progressive convergence of partial actions for the establishment of a Latin-American Common Market; \n* Flexibility; \n* Differential treatments based on the development level of the member countries; and \n* Multiple forms of trade agreements.\n\n== Integration Mechanisms ==\nThe ALADI promotes the establishment of an area of economic preferences within the region, in order to create a Latin-American common market, through three mechanisms:\n* A '''Regional Tariff Preference''' applied to goods from the member countries compared to tariffs in-force for third countries.\n* '''Regional Scope Agreements''', those in which all member countries participate.\n* '''Partial Scope Agreements''', those wherein two or more countries of the area participate.\n\nThe '''Relatively Less Economically Developed''' Countries of the region (Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay) benefit from a preferential system, through the lists of markets opening offered by the countries in favor of the Relatively Less Economically Developed Countries; special programs of cooperation (business rounds, pre-investment, financing, technological support); and countervailing measures in favor of the land-locked countries, the full participation of such countries in the integration process is sought.\nThe ALADI includes in its legal structure the strongest sub-regional, plurilateral and bilateral integration agreements arising in growing numbers in the continent. As a result, the ALADI \u2013 as an institutional and legal framework or \u201cumbrella\u201d of the regional integration- develops actions in order to support and foster these efforts for the progressive establishment of a common economic space.\n\n== Member states ==\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!State Members\n!Join Date\n!Population\n!Land Surface\n!Exclusive Economic Zone\n!Platform\n!Capital City\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Country|Argentina}} \n| Founder\n|  {{nts|40117096}}\n| {{nts|2780400}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|1084386}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|856346}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| [[Buenos Aires]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Country|Bolivia}}  \n| Founder\n| {{nts|10426160}}\n| {{nts|1098581}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| Landlocked\n|\n| [[Sucre]] & [[La Paz]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Country|Brazil}}  \n| Founder\n| {{nts|190732694}}\n| {{nts|8514877}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|3660955}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|774563}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| [[Brasilia]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Country|Chile}} \n| Founder\n| {{nts|17094275}}\n| {{nts|756096.3}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|3681989}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|252947}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| [[Santiago de Chile]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Country|Colombia}} \n| Founder\n| {{nts|45656937}}\n| {{nts|1141748}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|817816}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|53691}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| [[Bogot\u00e1]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Country|Cuba}} \n| 1999\n| {{nts|11242621}}\n| {{nts|110860}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|350751}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|61525}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| [[Havana]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Country|Ecuador}} \n| Founder\n| {{nts|14306876}}\n| {{nts|283561}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|1072533}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|41034}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| [[Quito]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Country|Mexico}}  \n| Founder\n| {{nts|112322757}}\n| {{nts|1972550}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|3177593}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|419102}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| [[Mexico City]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Country|Paraguay}} \n| Founder\n| {{nts|7030917}}\n| {{nts|406752}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| Landlocked\n|\n| [[Asunci\u00f3n]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Country|Panama}} \n| 2011\n| {{nts|3405813}}\n| {{nts|78200}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|335646}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|53404}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| [[Panama City]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Country|Peru}} \n| Founder\n| {{nts|29885340}}\n| {{nts|1285215.6}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|906454}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|82000}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| [[Lima]] \n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Country|Uruguay}} \n| Founder\n| {{nts|3424595}}\n| {{nts|176215}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|142166}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|75327}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| [[Montevideo]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Country|Venezuela}}  \n| Founder\n| {{nts|30102382}} \n| {{nts|916445}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|860000}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|98500}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| [[Caracas]]\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:#f0f0f0\"\n| Total:\n|\n| {{nts|521213563}}\n| {{nts|19651873}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|16214170}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n| {{nts|2839313}}&nbsp;km\u00b2\n|\n|}\n\n== Accession of other Latin-American countries ==\n{{Supranational American Bodies|size=400px|align=right}}\n\nThe 1980 Montevideo Treaty is open to the accession of any Latin-American country. \nOn 26 August 1999, the first accession to the 1980 Montevideo Treaty was executed, with the incorporation of the Republic of Cuba as a member country of the ALADI. \nOn 10 May 2012, the Republic of Panama became the thirteenth member country of the ALADI. \nLikewise, the accession of the Republic of Nicaragua was accepted in the Sixteenth Meeting of the Council of Ministers (Resolution 75 (XVI)), held on 11 August 2011. Currently, Nicaragua moves towards the fulfillment of conditions for becoming a member country of the ALADI.\nThe ALADI opens its field of actions for the rest of Latin America through multilateral links or partial agreements with other countries and integration areas of the continent (Article 25).\nThe Latin-American Integration Association also contemplates the horizontal cooperation with other integration movements in the world and partial actions with third developing countries or their respective integration areas (Article 27).\n\n== Institutional Structure ==\n[[File:ALADI - Institutional Structure.png|thumb|600px|center|ALADI - Institutional Structure]]\n\n;Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs\nThe Council of Ministers is the supreme body of the ALADI, and adopts the decisions for the superior political management of the integration process. \nIt is constituted by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the member countries. Notwithstanding, when one of such member countries assigns the competence of the integration affairs to a different Minister or Secretary of State, the member countries may be represented, with full powers, by the respective Minister or Secretary. It is convened by the Committee of Representatives, meets and makes decisions with the presence of all the member countries.\n\n;Evaluation and Convergence Conference\nIt is in charge, among others, of analyzing the functioning of the integration process in all its aspects, promoting the convergence of the partial scope agreements seeking their progressive multilateralization, and promoting greater scope actions as regards economic integration. It is made up of Plenipotentiaries of the member countries.\n\n;Committee of Representatives\nIt is the permanent political body and negotiating forum of the ALADI, where all the initiatives for the fulfillment of the objectives established by the 1980 Montevideo Treaty are analyzed and agreed on. It is composed of a Permanent  Representative of each member country with right to one vote and an Alternate Representative.  It meets regularly every 15 days and its Resolutions are adopted by the affirmative vote of two thirds of the member countries.\n\n;General Secretariat \nIt is the technical body of the ALADI, and it may propose, evaluate, study and manage for the fulfillment of the objectives of the ALADI. It is composed of technical and administrative personnel, and directed by a Secretary-General, who has the support of two Undersecretaries, elected for a three-year period, renewable for the same term.\n\n[[File:ALADI Fachada.jpg|thumb|centre|500px|[[Montevideo]], ALADI's site.]]\n\n== Secretaries General ==\n{{div col|colwidth=33em}}\n* 1980&ndash;1984 {{flagicon|PAR}} Julio C\u00e9sar Schupp (Paraguay)\n* 1984&ndash;1987 {{flagicon|URU}}  Juan Jos\u00e9 Real (Uruguay)\n* 1987&ndash;1990 {{flagicon|ARG}} Norberto Bertaina (Argentina)\n* 1990&ndash;1993 {{flagicon|COL}} Jorge Luis Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez (Colombia)\n* 1993&ndash;1999 {{flagicon|BRA}} Ant\u00f4nio Jos\u00e9 de Cerqueira Antunes (Brasil)\n* 2000&ndash;2005 {{flagicon|VEN}} Juan Francisco Rojas Penso (Venezuela) <ref name=\"secgral\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aladi.org/nsfaladi/prensa.nsf/c58ebfec3291eb91032574a2006afe80/52ad96dec823919383256934005ebe85?OpenDocument |title=20th Anniversary of the Treaty of Montevideo |date=2000-08-07 |publisher=ALADI |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n* 2005&ndash;2008 {{flagicon|URU}} [[Didier Opertti]] (Uruguay) <ref name=\"25 aniv\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aladi.org/nsfaladi/prensa.nsf/c58ebfec3291eb91032574a2006afe80/683de92cdc8e98910325705a005a5db9?OpenDocument |title=25th Anniversary of the Treaty of Montevideo |date=2005-08-11 |publisher=ALADI |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n* 2008&ndash;2009 {{flagicon|PAR}} Bernardino Hugo Saguier-Caballero (Paraguay)\n* 2009&ndash;2011 {{flagicon|PAR}} [[Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Fern\u00e1ndez Estigarribia]] (Paraguay) <ref name=\"30 aniv\">{{cite web \n|url=http://www.aladi.org/nsfaladi/prensa.nsf/c58ebfec3291eb91032574a2006afe80/cc1f4db4d6a3652a032577840054d757?OpenDocument |title=30th Anniversary of the Treaty of Montevideo |date=2010-08-19 |publisher=ALADI |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n* 2011&ndash;''2014'' {{flagicon|ARG}} [[Carlos \u00c1lvarez (politician)|Carlos \u00c1lvarez]] (Argentina)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Free trade]]\n* [[Free trade area]]\n* [[International trade]]\n* [[Central America Free Trade Agreement]]\n* [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]]\n* [[Latin American economy]]\n* [[Trade bloc]]\n* [[Mercosur]]\n* [[Andean Community of Nations]]\n* [[Union of South American Nations]]\n* [[Central American Integration System]]\n* [[Caribbean Community]]\n* [[Latin American Economic System]]\n* [[Latin American Parliament]]\n* [[PetroCaribe]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Commonscat|Latin American Integration Association}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Pan-Americanism}}\n\n[[Category:Latin America]]\n[[Category:Trade blocs]]\n[[Category:United Nations General Assembly observers]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Montevideo]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1980]]\n[[Category:Palermo, Montevideo]]", "sha1": "ohe6okty2c4z9qptvcp0aqo6bxedl7u"}}, {"title": "Aircraft spotting", "ns": "0", "id": "2858", "revision": {"id": "864341719", "parentid": "862667225", "timestamp": "2018-10-16T16:05:17Z", "contributor": {"username": "J 1982", "id": "777667"}, "comment": "/* External links */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2016}}\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2014}}\n[[File:KrasAir Ilyushin Il-96 spotting Mishin.jpg|thumb|300px|A group of spotters at [[Domodedovo International Airport]] taking photos of a [[KrasAir]] [[Ilyushin Il-96-300]] in 2008.]]\n\n'''Aircraft spotting''' or '''plane spotting''' is a hobby of tracking the movement of aircraft, which is often accomplished by photography. Besides monitoring aircraft, aircraft spotting enthusiasts (who are usually called plane spotters) also record information regarding [[airports]], [[air traffic control]] communications and airline routes.\n\n==History and evolution==\nAviation enthusiasts have been watching airplanes and other aircraft ever since they were invented. However, plane spotting was not considered a distinct hobby until the second half of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} \n\nDuring [[World War II]] and the subsequent [[Cold War]] some countries encouraged their citizens to become \"plane spotters\" in an \"observation corps\" or similar public body for reasons of public security. Britain had the [[Royal Observer Corps]] which operated between 1925 and 1995. A journal called ''The Aeroplane Spotter'' was published in January 1940. The publication included a glossary that was refined in 2010 and published online.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aeroplanemonthly.co.uk/glossary/ |title={title} |access-date=15 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212121117/http://www.aeroplanemonthly.co.uk/glossary/ |archive-date=12 February 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe development of technology and global resources enabled a revolution in spotting.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} [[Point and shoot camera]]s, [[DSLR]]s & [[walkie talkie]]s significantly changed the hobby. With the help of the internet, websites such as [[FlightAware]] and [[Flightradar24]] have made it possible for spotters to track and locate specific aircraft from all across the world. Websites specifically for aircraft, such as [[airliners.net]], and [[social networking]] websites, such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]], allow spotters to record their sightings and upload their shots or see pictures of aircraft spotted by other people from all over the world. People can upload videos to [[YouTube]], including inflight videos.\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:thunderbolt.a10.fairford.arp.jpg|thumb|right|The high engine position on this [[USAF]] [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] is an easily observed distinguishing feature of this aircraft.]]\nWhen spotting aircraft, observers generally notice the key attributes of an aircraft, such as a distinctive noise from its engine or the number of vapour trails it is leaving. Observers assess the size of the aircraft and the number, type and position of its engines.  Another distinctive attribute is the position of wings relative to the fuselage and the degree to which they are swept rearwards. The wings may be above the fuselage, below it, or fixed at midpoint. The number of wings indicate whether it is a monoplane, [[biplane]] or [[triplane]]. The position of the tailplane relative to the fin(s) and the shape of the fin are other attributes. The configuration of the [[landing gear]] can be distinctive, as well.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://disciplesofflight.com/tricycles-versus-taildraggers/|title=Tricycles versus Taildraggers|work=disciplesofflight.com|last=Belz|first=John |date=October 11, 2014|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:SXMDanger.jpg|thumb|Warning sign at [[Maho Beach]] for runway 10 approach to [[Princess Juliana International Airport]].]]\nOther features include the speed, cockpit placement, colour scheme or special equipment that changes the silhouette of the aircraft.  Taken together these traits will enable the identification of an aircraft. If the observer is familiar with the airfield being used by the aircraft and its normal traffic patterns, he or she is more likely to leap quickly to a decision about the aircraft's identity \u2013 they may have seen the same type of aircraft from the same angle many times. This is particularly prevalent if the aircraft spotter is spotting commercial aircraft, operated by airlines that have a limited fleet.  {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n[[File:malaysia airlines b747-400 specialcolours arp.jpg|thumb|right|Spotters and photographers enjoy seeing aircraft in special colour schemes. This is a [[Boeing 747-400]] of [[Malaysia Airlines]].]]\nSpotters use equipment such as [[ADS-B]] decoders to track the movements of aircraft. The two most famous devices used are the [[AirNav Systems RadarBox]] and Kinetic Avionics SBS series. Both of them read and process the radar data and show the movements on a computer screen. Most of the decoders also allow the exporting of logs from a certain route or airport.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD4vEE0uYR0&t=1m59s \"Plane Spotters at Dublin Airport\"] ''AustrianAviationNet'' ''[[YouTube]]''                    1 May 2011 Retrieved 17 July 2017</ref>\n\n==Spotting styles==\n[[File:Emirates Airbus A380 on finals to runway 23 at Toronto Pearson.jpg|thumb|right|Spotters opposite the [[Petro-Canada]] location on [[Airport Road (Ontario)|Airport Road]] in [[Mississauga]] photographing an [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] [[Airbus A380]] on final to [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] (March 2014).]]\nSome spotters will note and compile the markings, a [[Military aircraft insignia|national insignia]] or [[aircraft livery|airline livery]] or logo, a squadron badge or code letters in the case of a military aircraft. Published manuals allow more information to be deduced, such as the delivery date or the manufacturer's construction number. [[Camouflage]] markings differ, depending on the surroundings in which that aircraft is expected to operate.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn general, most spotters attempt to see as many aircraft of a given type, a particular airline, or a particular subset of aircraft such as [[business jet]]s, commercial [[airliner]]s, military and/or [[general aviation]] aircraft. Some spotters attempt to see every airframe and are known as \"frame spotters.\" Others are keen to see every registration worn by each aircraft. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n[[File:Qantas Boeing 747-400 VH-OJU over Starbeyevo Kustov.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Qantas]] [[Boeing 747-400]] flying over Starbeyevo, Moscow at an altitude of 11,000 metres. The photographer used a 1200mm telescope and 2x [[Barlow lens]] in order to take this photo from the ground.]]\nAncillary activities might include listening-in to [[air traffic control]] transmissions (using [[radio scanner]]s, where that is legal), liaising with other \"spotters\" to clear up uncertainties as to what aircraft have been seen at specific times or in particular places. Several [[internet mailing list]] groups have been formed to help communicate aircraft seen at airports, queries and anomalies. These groups can cater to certain regions, certain aircraft types, or may appeal to a wider audience. Many of these groups originated from the original Oxford.vax group which pioneered this type of communication. The result is that information on aircraft movements can be delivered worldwide in a real-time fashion to spotters.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe hobbyist might travel long distances to visit different airports, to see an unusual aircraft, or to view the remains of aircraft withdrawn from use. [[Air show]]s usually draw large numbers of spotters as it is a chance to enter [[airfield]]s and [[air base]]s worldwide that are usually closed to the public and to see displayed aircraft at close range. Some aircraft may be placed in the care of museums (see [[Aviation archaeology]]) \u2013 or perhaps be cannibalized in order to repair a similar aircraft already preserved.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nAircraft registrations can be found in books, with online resources, or in monthly magazines from enthusiast groups. Most spotters maintained books of different aircraft fleets and would underline or check each aircraft seen. Each year, a revised version of the books would be published and the spotter would need to re-underline every aircraft seen. With the development of commercial aircraft databases spotters were finally able to record their sightings in an electronic database and produce reports that emulated the underlined books.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Legal ramifications==\nThe legal repercussions of the hobby were dramatically shown in November 2001 when fourteen aircraft spotters (twelve British, two Dutch) were arrested by [[Hellenic Police|Greek police]] after being observed at an open day at the [[Greek Air Force]] base at [[Kalamata]]. They were charged with espionage, and faced a possible 20-year prison sentence if found guilty. After being held for six weeks, they were eventually released on \u00a39,000 bail, and the charges reduced to the [[misdemeanor]] charge of illegal information collection. Confident of their innocence they returned for their trial in April 2002 and were stunned to be found guilty, with eight of the group sentenced to three years, the rest for one year. At their appeal a year later all were acquitted.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1950198.stm \"Plane-spotters 'ignored warnings'.\"] ''BBC News'', 25 April 2002. Retrieved 14 March 2007.

[[Non-commercial]] entities that advertise more than consumer products or services include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies.

Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers ([[town crier]]s) to announce their whereabouts.

These early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the printing press; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after. However, [[false advertising]] and so-called \"[[Quackery|quack]]\" advertisements became a problem, which ushered in the regulation of advertising content.\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\n[[File:Edo period advertising in Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Edo period]] LEL flyer from 1806 for a traditional medicine called ''Kinseitan'']]\n[[Thomas J.

He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that \"tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different \u2013 it hits the present taste.\"<ref name=\"mat\" />\n\nAs the economy expanded across the world during the 19th century, advertising grew alongside. In the United States, the success of this advertising format eventually led to the growth of mail-order advertising.\n\nIn June 1836, French newspaper ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'' was the first to include paid advertising in its pages, allowing it to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] and the formula was soon copied by all titles. Around 1840, [[Volney B. Palmer]] established the roots of the modern day advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad \u2013 the copy, layout, and artwork \u2013 was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed when the first full-service advertising agency of N.W. Ayer & Son was founded in 1869 in Philadelphia. Ayer & Son offered to plan, create, and execute complete advertising campaigns for its customers. By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.\n<ref name=\"eskilson-pg58\">{{Cite book|title=Graphic Design: A New History |last=Eskilson |first=Stephen J. |year=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Connecticut |isbn=978-0-300-12011-0 |page=58 }}</ref> Around the same time, in France, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] extended the services of his news agency, [[Havas]] to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to organize.

Previously, DuMont had trouble finding sponsors for many of their programs and compensated by selling smaller blocks of advertising time to several businesses. This eventually became the standard for the commercial television industry in the United States. However, it was still a common practice to have single sponsor shows, such as [[The United States Steel Hour]]. In some instances the sponsors exercised great control over the content of the show \u2013 up to and including having one's advertising agency actually writing the show.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The single sponsor model is much less prevalent now, a notable exception being the [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==== Cable television from the 1980s ====\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of cable television and particularly [[MTV]].

The word \"infomercial\" is a [[portmanteau]] of the words \"information\" and \"commercial\". The main objective in an infomercial is to create an [[impulse purchase]], so that the target sees the presentation and then immediately buys the product through the advertised [[toll-free telephone number]] or website.

While radio has the limitation of being restricted to sound, proponents of radio advertising often cite this as an advantage. Radio is an expanding medium that can be found on air, and also online.

Although many Internet users search for ideas and products using search engines and mobile phones, a large number of users around the world still use the address bar. They will type a keyword into the address bar such as \"geraniums\" and add \".com\" to the end of it. Sometimes they will do the same with \".org\" or a country-code Top Level Domain (TLD such as \".co.uk\" for the United Kingdom or \".ca\" for Canada).

For example, in a film, the main character can use an item or other of a definite brand, as in the movie ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', where [[Tom Cruise]]'s character John Anderton owns a phone with the ''[[Nokia]]'' logo clearly written in the top corner, or his watch engraved with the ''[[Bulgari]]'' logo. Another example of advertising in film is in ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', where main character played by [[Will Smith]] mentions his ''[[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]'' shoes several times, calling them \"classics\", because the film is set far in the future. ''I, Robot'' and ''[[Spaceballs]]'' also showcase futuristic cars with the ''[[Audi]]'' and ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'' logos clearly displayed on the front of the vehicles. [[Cadillac]] chose to advertise in the movie ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', which as a result contained many scenes in which Cadillac cars were used. Similarly, product placement for [[Omega SA|Omega Watches]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[VAIO]], [[BMW]] and [[Aston Martin]] cars are featured in recent [[James Bond]] films, most notably ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. In \"[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]\", the main transport vehicle shows a large [[Dodge]] logo on the front. ''[[Blade Runner]]'' includes some of the most obvious product placement; the whole film stops to show a [[Coca-Cola]] billboard.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n;Print: Print advertising describes advertising in a printed medium such as a newspaper, magazine, or trade journal. This encompasses everything from media with a very broad readership base, such as a major national newspaper or magazine, to more narrowly targeted media such as local newspapers and trade journals on very specialized topics. One form of print advertising is [[classified advertising]], which allows private individuals or companies to purchase a small, narrowly targeted ad paid by the word or line. Another form of print advertising is the display ad, which is generally a larger ad with design elements that typically run in an article section of a newspaper.<ref name=\"Bovee\" />{{rp|14}}\n\n;Outdoor: [[Billboard]]s, also known as hoardings in some parts of the world, are large structures located in public places which display advertisements to passing pedestrians and motorists. Most often, they are located on main roads with a large amount of passing motor and pedestrian traffic; however, they can be placed in any location with large numbers of viewers, such as on mass transit vehicles and in stations, in shopping malls or office buildings, and in stadiums. The form known as street advertising first came to prominence in the UK by Street Advertising Services to create outdoor advertising on street furniture and pavements. Working with products such as [[Reverse Graffiti]], [[air dancer]]s and 3D pavement advertising, for getting brand messages out into public spaces.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Sheltered outdoor advertising combines outdoor with indoor advertisement by placing large mobile, structures ([[tents]]) in public places on temporary bases. The large outer advertising space aims to exert a strong pull on the observer, the product is promoted indoors, where the creative decor can intensify the impression.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Mobile billboard]]s are generally vehicle mounted [[billboard]]s or digital screens. These can be on dedicated vehicles built solely for carrying advertisements along routes preselected by clients, they can also be specially equipped cargo trucks or, in some cases, large banners strewn from planes. The billboards are often lighted; some being [[Backlight|backlit]], and others employing spotlights. Some billboard displays are static, while others change; for example, continuously or periodically rotating among a set of advertisements. Mobile displays are used for various situations in metropolitan areas throughout the world, including: target advertising, one-day and long-term campaigns, conventions, sporting events, store openings and similar promotional events, and big advertisements from smaller companies.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Redeye Sailboat.jpg|thumb|The ''[[RedEye]]'' newspaper advertised to its target market at [[North Avenue Beach]] with a sailboat billboard on [[Lake Michigan]].]]\n\n;Point-of-sale: In-store advertising is any advertisement placed in a retail store. It includes placement of a product in visible locations in a store, such as at eye level, at the ends of aisles and near checkout counters (a.k.a. POP \u2013 point of purchase display), eye-catching displays promoting a specific product, and advertisements in such places as shopping carts and in-store video displays.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n;Novelties: Advertising printed on small tangible items such as coffee mugs, T-shirts, pens, bags, and such is known as [[Novelty item|novelty advertising]]. Some printers specialize in printing novelty items, which can then be distributed directly by the advertiser, or items may be distributed as part of a cross-promotion, such as ads on fast food containers. {{citation needed| date= January 2017}}\n\n;Celebrity endorsements: Advertising in which a celebrity endorses a product or brand leverages celebrity power, fame, money, popularity to gain recognition for their products or to promote specific stores' or products. Advertisers often advertise their products, for example, when celebrities share their favorite products or wear clothes by specific brands or designers. Celebrities are often involved in advertising campaigns such as television or print adverts to advertise specific or general products. The use of celebrities to endorse a brand can have its downsides, however; one mistake by a celebrity can be detrimental to the [[public relations]] of a brand. For example, following his performance of eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, swimmer [[Michael Phelps]]' contract with [[Kellogg's]] was terminated, as Kellogg's did not want to associate with him after he was photographed smoking marijuana.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Celebrities such as [[Britney Spears]] have advertised for multiple products including Pepsi, Candies from Kohl's, Twister, NASCAR, and Toyota.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n;[[Aerial advertising|Aerial]]: Using aircraft, [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] or [[airship]]s to create or display advertising media.

Unlike search, which requires someone to be aware of a need, display advertising can drive awareness of something new and without previous knowledge. Display works well for direct response. Display is not only used for generating awareness, it's used for direct response campaigns that link to a landing page with a clear 'call to action'.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nAs the mobile phone became a new mass medium in 1998 when the first paid downloadable content appeared on mobile phones in Finland,<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Brief History of Science with Levity|last=Bennet|first=Mike|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978 1784622954|location=|pages=301|via=}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[mobile advertising]] followed, also first launched in Finland in 2000.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} By 2007 the value of mobile advertising had reached $2 billion and providers such as [[Admob]] delivered billions of mobile ads.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nMore advanced mobile ads include banner ads, coupons, [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] picture and video messages, advergames and various [[engagement marketing]] campaigns. A particular feature driving mobile ads is the [[2D barcode]], which replaces the need to do any typing of web addresses, and uses the camera feature of modern phones to gain immediate access to web content. 83 percent of Japanese mobile phone users already are active users of 2D barcodes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nSome companies have proposed placing messages or corporate logos on the side of booster [[rocket]]s and the [[International Space Station]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nUnpaid advertising (also called \"publicity advertising\"), can include personal recommendations (\"bring a friend\", \"sell it\"), spreading buzz, or achieving the feat of equating a brand with a common noun (in the United States, \"[[Xerox]]\" = \"[[photocopier]]\", \"[[Kleenex]]\" = [[Facial tissue|tissue]], \"[[Vaseline]]\" = [[petroleum jelly]], \"[[The Hoover Company|Hoover]]\" = [[vacuum cleaner]], and \"[[Band-Aid]]\" = [[adhesive bandage]]). However, some companies{{which|date=December 2014}} oppose the use of their brand name to label an object.

Pop-up, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], banner, pop-under, [[advergaming]], and email advertisements (all of which are often unwanted or spam in the case of email) are now commonplace. Particularly since the rise of \"entertaining\" advertising, some people may like an advertisement enough to wish to watch it later or show a friend.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In general, the advertising community has not yet made this easy, although some have used the Internet to widely distribute their ads to anyone willing to see or hear them. In the last three quarters of 2009, mobile and Internet advertising grew by 18% and 9% respectively, while older media advertising saw declines: \u221210.1% (TV), \u221211.7% (radio), \u221214.8% (magazines) and \u221218.7% (newspapers).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Between 2008 and 2014, U.S. newspapers lost more than half their print advertising revenue.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=Jason|title=Will John Henry Save the Globe?|url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/|publisher=Boston Magazine|date=March 2014|page=133}}</ref>\n\n=== Niche marketing ===\n\nAnother significant trend regarding future of advertising is the growing importance of the [[niche market]] using niche or targeted ads. Also brought about by the Internet and the theory of the [[long tail]], advertisers will have an increasing ability to reach specific audiences. In the past, the most efficient way to deliver a message was to blanket the largest [[mass market]] audience possible.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} However, usage tracking, customer profiles and the growing popularity of niche content brought about by everything from blogs to social networking sites, provide advertisers with audiences that are smaller but much better defined,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} leading to ads that are more relevant to viewers and more effective for companies' marketing products. Among others, [[Comcast Spotlight]] is one such advertiser employing this method in their [[video on demand]] menus. These advertisements are targeted to a specific group and can be viewed by anyone wishing to find out more about a particular business or practice, from their home. This causes the viewer to become proactive and actually choose what advertisements they want to view.<ref>[http://www.comcastspotlight.com/sites/Default.aspx?pageid=7608&siteid=62&subnav=3 \"Interactive \u2013 VOD\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326200208/http://www.comcastspotlight.com/sites/Default.aspx?pageid=7608&siteid=62&subnav=3 |date=March 26, 2009 }} \"Comcast Spotlight website\". Retrieved October 5, 2006.</ref>\nNiche marketing could also be helped by bringing the issue of colour into advertisements. Different colours play major roles when it comes to marketing strategies, for example, seeing the blue can promote a sense of calmness and gives a sense of security which is why many social networks such as Facebook use blue in their logos.   \n[[Google AdSense]] is an example of niche marketing. Google calculates the primary purpose of a website and adjusts ads accordingly; it uses keywords on the page (or even in emails) to find the general ideas of topics disused and places ads that will most likely be clicked on by viewers of the email account or website visitors.\n\n=== Crowdsourcing ===\n{{Main|Crowdsourcing}}\n\nThe concept of crowdsourcing has given way to the trend of [[user-generated]] advertisements. User-generated ads are created by people, as opposed to an advertising agency or the company themselves, often resulting from brand sponsored advertising competitions. For the 2007 Super Bowl, the Frito-Lays division of [[PepsiCo]] held the \"Crash the Super Bowl\" contest, allowing people to create their own [[Doritos]] commercials.<ref name=\"Advertising Age\">{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |title=Who's Buying What at Super Bowl 2007 |publisher=Advertising Age |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218070122/http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |archivedate=February 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Chevrolet]] held a similar competition for their Tahoe line of SUVs.<ref name=\"Advertising Age\" /> Due to the success of the Doritos user-generated ads in the 2007 Super Bowl, Frito-Lays relaunched the competition for the 2009 and 2010 Super Bowl. The resulting ads were among the most-watched and most-liked Super Bowl ads. In fact, the winning ad that aired in the 2009 Super Bowl was ranked by the [[USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter]] as the top ad for the year while the winning ads that aired in the 2010 Super Bowl were found by Nielsen's BuzzMetrics to be the \"most buzzed-about\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |title=Do-It-Yourself Super Ads |publisher=New York Times |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |first=Stuart |last=Elliott |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217050431/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |archivedate=February 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |title='Two nobodies from nowhere' craft winning Super Bowl ad |publisher=USA Today |date=December 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |first=Bruce |last=Horovitz |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227030845/http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |archivedate=December 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Another example of companies using crowdsourcing successfully is the beverage company [[Jones Soda]] that encourages consumers to participate in the label design themselves.\n\nThis trend has given rise to several online platforms that host user-generated advertising competitions on behalf of a company.

For [[Global marketing|global advertisers]], there are four, potentially competing, business objectives that must be balanced when developing worldwide advertising: building a brand while speaking with one voice, developing [[economies of scale]] in the creative process, maximising local effectiveness of ads, and increasing the company's speed of implementation. Born from the evolutionary stages of global marketing are the three primary and fundamentally different approaches to the development of global advertising executions: exporting executions, producing local executions, and importing ideas that travel.<ref>Global marketing Management, 2004, pp. 13\u20138</ref>\n\nAdvertising research is key to determining the success of an ad in any country or region. The ability to identify which elements and/or moments of an ad contribute to its success is how [[economies of scale]] are maximized. Once one knows what works in an ad, that idea or ideas can be imported by any other market. [[Market research]] measures, such as [[Wikt:flow of attention|Flow of Attention]], [[Wikt:flow of emotion|Flow of Emotion]] and [[Wikt:branding moment|branding moments]] provide insight into what is working in an ad in any country or region because the measures are based on the visual, not verbal, elements of the ad.<ref>Young, p.131</ref>\n\n=== Foreign public messaging ===\n{{See also|Soft power|International tourism advertising}}\n\nForeign governments,{{which|date=December 2014}} particularly those that own marketable commercial products or services, often promote their interests and positions through the advertising of those goods because the target audience is not only largely unaware of the forum as a vehicle for foreign messaging but also willing to receive the message while in a mental state of absorbing information from advertisements during television commercial breaks, while reading a periodical, or while passing by billboards in public spaces. A prime example of this messaging technique is advertising campaigns to promote international travel. While advertising foreign destinations and services may stem from the typical goal of increasing revenue by drawing more tourism, some travel campaigns carry the additional or alternative intended purpose of promoting good sentiments or improving existing ones among the target audience towards a given nation or region. It is common for advertising promoting foreign countries to be produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads often carry political statements and/or depictions of the foreign government's [[Perception management|desired international public perception]]. Additionally, a wide range of foreign airlines and travel-related services which advertise separately from the destinations, themselves, are owned by their respective governments; examples include, though are not limited to, the [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates airline]] ([[Dubai]]), [[Singapore Airlines]] (Singapore), [[Qatar Airways]] ([[Qatar]]), [[China Airlines]] ([[Taiwan]]/[[Republic of China]]), and [[Air China]] (People's Republic of China). By depicting their destinations, airlines, and other services in a favorable and pleasant light, countries market themselves to populations abroad in a manner that could mitigate prior public impressions.\n\n=== Diversification ===\n\nIn the realm of [[advertising agencies]], continued industry diversification has seen observers note that \"big global clients don't need big global agencies any more\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Howard |first=Theresa |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |title=USA Today, October 9, 2005 |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=October 10, 2005 |accessdate=April 20, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327010633/http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |archivedate=March 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This is reflected by the growth of non-traditional agencies in various global markets, such as Canadian business [[TAXI (advertising agency)|TAXI]] and [[SMART (advertising agency)|SMART]] in Australia and has been referred to as \"a revolution in the ad world\".<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/12/12/8363132/index.htm\n |title       = Madison Ave. Lights Up\n |first       = Devin\n |last        = Leonard\n |publisher   = [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]\n |date        = December 12, 2005\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090606210859/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/12/12/8363132/index.htm\n |archivedate = June 6, 2009\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n=== New technology ===\n\nThe ability to record shows on [[digital video recorder]]s (such as TiVo) allow watchers to record the programs for later viewing, enabling them to fast forward through commercials. Additionally, as more seasons of pre-recorded [[box set]]s are offered for sale of television programs; fewer people watch the shows on TV. However, the fact that these sets are '''sold''', means the company will receive additional profits from these sets.\n\nTo counter this effect, a variety of strategies have been employed. Many advertisers have opted for product placement on TV shows like [[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]. Other strategies include integrating advertising with internet-connected [[EPG]]s, advertising on companion devices (like smartphones and tablets) during the show, and creating [[TV apps]]. Additionally, some like brands have opted for [[social television]] sponsorship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2011/05/09/survivor-jeff-probst-says-product-placement-is-here-to-stay/|title=Reality TV|website=realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419064602/http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2011/05/09/survivor-jeff-probst-says-product-placement-is-here-to-stay/|archivedate=April 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe emerging technology of [[drone display]]s has recently been used for advertising purposes.<ref>http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2016/11/intel-launches-500-drones-into-sky-and-breaks-world-record-in-spectacular-style-449886</ref>\n\n=== Advertising education ===\n\nIn recent years there have been several media literacy initiatives, and more specifically concerning advertising, that seek to empower citizens in the face of media advertising campaigns.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Britt|last2=Schellens|first2=Tammy|last3=Valcke|first3=Martin|date=2017|title=Promoting Adolescents\u2019 Moral Advertising Literacy in Secondary Education|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C52-2017-09|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=93\u2013103|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-09|issn=1134-3478}}</ref>\n\n[[Advertising education]] has become popular with bachelor, master and doctorate degrees becoming available in the emphasis.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A surge in advertising interest is typically attributed to the strong relationship advertising plays in cultural and technological changes, such as the advance of online social networking.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A unique model for teaching advertising is the [[student-run advertising agency]], where advertising students create campaigns for real companies.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED351711&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED351711\n |title       = Student-Run Advertising Agency: A Showcase for Student Work.\n |first       = James\n |last        = Avery\n |date        = 1992-08-01\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090724163231/http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true\n |archivedate = July 24, 2009\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> Organizations such as the [[American Advertising Federation]] establish companies with students to create these campaigns.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n== Purposes ==\nAdvertising is at the front of delivering the proper message to customers and prospective customers.

It entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologies. Advertising research includes pre-testing (also known as [[copy testing]]) and post-testing of ads and/or campaigns.\n\nPre-testing includes a wide range of qualitative and quantitative techniques, including: focus groups, in-depth target audience interviews (one-on-one interviews), small-scale quantitative studies and physiological measurement. The goal of these investigations is to better understand how different groups respond to various messages and visual prompts, thereby providing an assessment of how well the advertisement meets its communications goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.copytesting.org|title=CopyTesting.org|website=www.copytesting.org|access-date=2017-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425021551/http://copytesting.org/|archivedate=April 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nPost-testing employs many of the same techniques as pre-testing, usually with a focus on understanding the change in awareness or attitude attributable to the advertisement. With the emergence of digital advertising technologies, many firms have begun to continuously post-test ads using real-time data. This may take the form of A/B split-testing or multivariate testing.\n\nContinuous [[ad tracking]] and the [[Communicus]] System are competing examples of post-testing advertising research types.<ref>Peeter Verlegh, Hilde Voorveld, and Martin Eisend, eds.

Advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within [[brand names]], [[logos]], package designs, print advertisements, and [[television advertisements]]. Semiotics aims to study and interpret the message being conveyed in (for example) advertisements. Logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels \u2013 known as the surface level and the underlying level. The surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for a product.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} These signs can be images, words, fonts, [[color]]s, or slogans. The underlying level is made up of hidden meanings. The combination of images, words, [[color]]s, and slogans must be interpreted by the audience or consumer.<ref>{{cite book|last= Beasley|first= Ron|title= Persuasive Signs: The Semiotics of Advertising|year= 2002|publisher= Walter deGruyter GmbH & KG|location= Berlin, Germany|isbn= 3-11-017341-7}}</ref> The \"key to advertising analysis\" is the signifier and the signified.

They placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing. However, the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white iPod through white headphones.

When considering [[Gender advertisement|gender roles in advertising]], individuals are influenced by three categories. Certain characteristics of stimuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the message (if the product is perceived as [[feminine]] or [[masculine]]). Second, the characteristics of individuals can affect [[attention]] and elaboration of the message ([[tradition]]al or non-traditional [[gender role]] orientation).

Later research by a Danish team<ref>Vestergaard and Schr\u00f8der, ''The Language of Advertising'', 75</ref> found that advertising attempts to persuade men to improve their appearance or performance, whereas its approach to women aims at [[transformation (disambiguation)|transformation]] toward an impossible ideal of female presentation. In Paul Suggett's article \"The Objectification of Women in Advertising\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|title=Advertising Sets Impossible Standards for Women|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-05-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326082225/https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|archivedate=March 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> he discusses the negative impact that these women in advertisements, who are too perfect to be real, have on women, as well as men, in real life. Advertising's manipulation of women's aspiration to these ideal types as portrayed in film, in erotic art, in advertising, on stage, within music videos, and through other media exposures requires at least a conditioned rejection of female reality, and thereby takes on a highly ideological cast. Studies show that these expectations of women and young girls negatively impact their views about their bodies and appearances. These advertisements are directed towards men. Not everyone agrees: one critic viewed this monologic, gender-specific interpretation of advertising as excessively skewed and politicized.<ref>Splendora, \"Discourse\", Review of Vestergaard and Schr\u00f8der, ''The Language of Advertising'' in ''Language in Society,'' 449</ref>{{qn|date=February 2017}} There are some companies, however, like [[Dove Beauties|Dove]] and [[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]] that are creating commercials to portray more natural women, with less [[image manipulation|post production manipulation]], so more women and young girls are able to relate to them.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} These commercials give more natural beauty standards.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nMore recent research by Martin (2003) reveals that males and females differ in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of exposure to the ads, and on the affective tone of the advertising. When feeling sad, males prefer happy ads to boost their mood. In contrast, females prefer happy ads when they are feeling happy. The television programs in which ads are embedded influence a viewer's mood state.<ref>\nMartin, Brett A. S.

It must be able to follow the author's argument, so it must have some ability to [[artificial intelligence#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]. It must have extensive [[commonsense knowledge|world knowledge]] so that it knows what is being discussed \u2014 it must at least be familiar with all the same commonsense facts that the average human translator knows. Some of this knowledge is in the form of facts that can be explicitly represented, but some knowledge is unconscious and closely tied to the human body: for example, the machine may need to understand how an ocean makes one ''feel'' to accurately translate a specific metaphor in the text. It must also model the authors' goals, intentions, and emotional states to accurately reproduce them in a new language. In short, the machine is required to have wide variety of human intellectual skills, including [[artificial intelligence#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]], [[commonsense knowledge]] and the intuitions that underlie [[robotics|motion and manipulation]], [[machine perception|perception]], and [[artificial intelligence#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]. [[Machine translation]], therefore, is believed to be AI-complete: it may require strong AI to be done as well as humans can do it.\n\n==Software brittleness==\n{{main|Software brittleness}}\nCurrent AI systems can solve very simple and/or restricted versions of AI-complete problems, but never in their full generality. When AI researchers attempt to \"scale up\" their systems to handle more complicated, real world situations, the programs tend to become excessively [[brittle (software)|brittle]] without [[commonsense knowledge]] or a rudimentary understanding of the situation: they fail as unexpected circumstances outside of its original problem context begin to appear.  When human beings are dealing with new situations in the world, they are helped immensely by the fact that they know what to expect: they know what all things around them are, why they are there, what they are likely to do and so on. They can recognize unusual situations and adjust accordingly. A machine without strong AI has no other skills to fall back on.<ref>{{Citation | last=Lenat | first=Douglas |  last2=Guha | first2=R.

By definition it does not cover problems whose solution is unknown or has not been characterised formally.  Since many AI problems have no formalisation yet, conventional complexity theory does not allow the definition of AI-completeness.\n\nTo address this problem, a complexity theory for AI has been proposed.<ref name=\"ucl.ac.uk\">Dafna Shahaf and Eyal Amir (2007) [http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2007/SS-07-05/SS07-05-026.pdf Towards a theory of AI completeness].

Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with [[historical astronomy]], the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the [[history of astronomy]], which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice.[[File:Equinozio da Pizzo Vento,tramonto fondachelli fantina, sicilia.JPG|thumb| the sunset at the [[equinox]] seen from the prehistoric site of Pizzo Vento at [[Fondachelli-Fantina|Fondachelli Fantina]], [[Sicily]]]]\n\nArchaeoastronomy uses a variety of methods to uncover evidence of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers.<ref>Iwaniszewski 2003, 7-10</ref> Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in [[landscape archaeology]] and [[cognitive archaeology]]. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into [[Paganism|beliefs about the cycles of nature]], such as [[Maya civilization#Astronomy|Mayan astronomy]] and its relationship with agriculture.<ref>Aveni 1980</ref> Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.<ref>Chiu & Morrison 1980</ref><ref>Magli 2008</ref>\n\nArchaeoastronomy can be applied to all cultures and all time periods. The meanings of the sky vary from culture to culture; nevertheless there are scientific methods which can be applied across cultures when examining ancient beliefs.<ref>McCluskey 2005</ref> It is perhaps the need to balance the social and scientific aspects of archaeoastronomy which led Clive Ruggles to describe it as: ''\"...[A] field with academic work of high quality at one end but uncontrolled speculation bordering on lunacy at the other\"''.<ref>Carlson 1999</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{quote|In his short history of 'Astro-archaeology' John Michell argued that the status of research into ancient astronomy had improved over the past two centuries, going 'from lunacy to heresy to interesting notion and finally to the gates of orthodoxy.' Nearly two decades later, we can still ask the question: Is archaeoastronomy still waiting at the gates of orthodoxy or has it gotten inside the gates?|Todd Bostwick quoting John Michell<ref>Bostwick 2006:13</ref>}}\n\nTwo hundred years before Michell wrote the above, there were no archaeoastronomers and there were no [[Archaeology#History of archaeology|professional archaeologists]], but there were astronomers and [[Antiquarianism|antiquarians]]. Some of their works are considered precursors of archaeoastronomy; antiquarians interpreted the astronomical orientation of the ruins that dotted the English countryside as [[William Stukeley]] did of [[Stonehenge]] in 1740,<ref>Michell, 2001:9-10</ref> while [[John Aubrey]] in 1678<ref>Johnson, 1912:225</ref> and [[Henry Chauncy]] in 1700 sought similar astronomical principles underlying the orientation of churches.<ref>Hoskin, 2001:7</ref>  Late in the nineteenth century astronomers such as [[Richard Proctor]] and [[Charles Piazzi Smyth]] investigated the astronomical orientations of [[Egyptian pyramids|the pyramids]].<ref>Michell, 2001:17-18</ref>\n\nThe term ''archaeoastronomy'' was first used by Elizabeth Chesley Baity (at the suggestion of Euan MacKie) in 1973,<ref>Sinclair 2006:17</ref> but as a topic of study it may be much older, depending on how archaeoastronomy is defined. Clive Ruggles<ref>Ruggles 2005:312-3</ref> says that [[Heinrich Nissen]], working in the mid-nineteenth century was arguably the first archaeoastronomer. Rolf Sinclair<ref>Sinclair 2006:8</ref> says that [[Norman Lockyer]], working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could be called the 'father of archaeoastronomy'. Euan MacKie<ref>Mackie 2006:243</ref> would place the origin even later, stating: \"...the genesis and modern flowering of archaeoastronomy must surely lie in the work of [[Alexander Thom]] in Britain between the 1930s and the 1970s\".\n\n[[Image:Auglish.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Early archaeoastronomers surveyed Megalithic constructs in the British Isles, at sites like [[Auglish]] in [[County Londonderry]], in an attempt to find statistical patterns.]]\nIn the 1960s the work of the engineer Alexander Thom and that of the astronomer [[Gerald Hawkins]], who proposed that [[Stonehenge]] was a [[Neolithic]] computer,<ref>Hawkins 1976</ref> inspired new interest in the astronomical features of ancient sites. The claims of Hawkins were largely dismissed,<ref>Atkinson 1966</ref> but this was not the case for Alexander Thom's work, whose survey results of [[megalith]]ic sites hypothesized widespread practice of accurate astronomy in the British Isles.<ref>Thom 1988:9-10</ref>  Euan MacKie, recognizing that Thom's theories needed to be tested, excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter's prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct. There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom's long alignment hypothesis (Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate [[winter solstice]] site) led him to check Thom's geometrical theories at the Cultoon [[stone circle]] in Islay, also with a positive result. MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom's conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain.<ref name = \"zkuawc\">MacKie 1977</ref> In contrast a re-evaluation of Thom's fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom's claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence.<ref>Gingerich 2000</ref> Nevertheless, Thom's legacy remains strong, Krupp<ref>Krupp 1979:18</ref> wrote in 1979, \"Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeo-astronomical fieldwork and interpretation, and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades.\" His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy.<ref>Hicks 1993</ref><ref>Iwaniszewski 1995</ref>\n\n[[Image:Uxmal01-panorama.jpg|thumb|left|250px|It has been proposed that [[Maya civilization|Maya]] sites such as [[Uxmal]] were built in accordance with astronomical alignments.]]The approach in the [[New World]], where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in [[Amerindian]] civilizations, was markedly different. They had access to sources that the [[prehistory]] of Europe lacks such as [[ethnography|ethnographies]]<ref>Zeilik 1985</ref><ref>Zeilik 1986</ref> and the historical records of the early [[Colonization of the Americas|colonizers]]. Following the pioneering example of Anthony Aveni,<ref>Milbraith 1999:8</ref><ref>Broda 2000:233</ref> this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation. The concentration on historical data led to some claims of high accuracy that were comparatively weak when compared to the statistically led investigations in Europe.<ref>Hoskin 1996</ref>\n\nThis came to a head at a meeting sponsored by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) in [[Oxford]] in 1981.<ref>Ruggles 1993:ix</ref> The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes.<ref>Aveni 1982</ref><ref>Heggie 1982</ref> Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research,<ref>Aveni, 1989a:xi\u2013xiii</ref> which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky.\n\n== Relations to other disciplines ==\n{{quote|...[O]ne of the most endearing characteristics of archaeoastronomy is its capacity to set academics in different disciplines at loggerheads with each other.|Clive Ruggles<ref>Ruggles 2000</ref>}}\n\nArchaeoastronomy has long been seen as an interdisciplinary field that uses written and unwritten evidence to study the astronomies of other cultures.  As such, it can be seen as connecting other disciplinary approaches for investigating ancient astronomy: astroarchaeology (an obsolete term for studies that draw astronomical information from the alignments of ancient architecture and landscapes), [[history of astronomy]] (which deals primarily with the written textual evidence), and ethnoastronomy (which draws on the ethnohistorical record and contemporary ethnographic studies).<ref>Aveni 1981: 1-2</ref><ref>Aveni 2003: 150</ref>\n\nReflecting Archaeoastronomy's development as an interdisciplinary subject, research in the field is conducted by investigators trained in a wide range of disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work as concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. Only rarely did they describe their work as astronomical, and then only as a secondary category.<ref>McCluskey 2004</ref>\n\nBoth practicing archaeoastronomers and observers of the discipline approach it from different perspectives. George Gummerman and Miranda Warburton view archaeoastronomy as part of an archaeology informed by [[cultural anthropology]] and aimed at understanding a \"group's conception of themselves in relation to the heavens', in a word, its cosmology.<ref>Gummerman & Warburton 2005</ref>  Todd Bostwick argued that \"archaeoastronomy is anthropology \u2013 the study of human behavior in the past and present.\"<ref>Bostwick 2006:3</ref>  [[Paul Bahn]] has described archaeoastronomy as an area of cognitive archaeology.<ref>Bahn 1996:49</ref> Other researchers relate archaeoastronomy to the history of science, either as it relates to a culture's observations of nature and the conceptual framework they devised to impose an order on those observations<ref>McCluskey 2001</ref> or as it relates to the political motives which drove particular historical actors to deploy certain astronomical concepts or techniques.<ref>Broda 2006</ref><ref>Aldana 2007:14-15</ref>  Art historian Richard Poss took a more flexible approach, maintaining that the astronomical rock art of the North American Southwest should be read employing \"the hermeneutic traditions of western art history and art criticism\"<ref>Poss 2005:97</ref> Astronomers, however, raise different questions, seeking to provide their students with identifiable [[Precursorism|precursors]] of their discipline, and are especially concerned with the important question of how to confirm that specific sites are, indeed, intentionally astronomical.<ref>Schaefer 2006a:30</ref>\n\nThe reactions of professional archaeologists to archaeoastronomy have been decidedly mixed. Some expressed incomprehension or even hostility, varying from a rejection by the archaeological mainstream of what they saw as an archaeoastronomical fringe to an incomprehension between the cultural focus of archaeologists and the quantitative focus of early archaeoastronomers.<ref>Ruggles 1999: 3-9</ref>  Yet archaeologists have increasingly come to incorporate many of the insights from archaeoastronomy into archaeology textbooks<ref>Fisher 2006</ref> and, as mentioned above, some students wrote archaeology dissertations on archaeoastronomical topics.\n\nSince archaeoastronomers disagree so widely on the characterization of the discipline, they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy to the study of culture, using the term ''Astronomy in Culture'' or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees an important part of the discipline as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of the discipline ''Archaeotopography.''<ref>Hoskin 2001:13-14.</ref> Ruggles and Saunders proposed ''Cultural Astronomy'' as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies.<ref>Ruggles & Saunders 1993:1-31</ref> Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are [[cosmology|cosmologies]] and people who object to the use of [[logos]] have suggested adopting the Spanish ''cosmovisi\u00f3n''.<ref>Ruggles 2005:115-117</ref>\n\nWhen debates polarise between techniques, the methods are often referred to by a colour code, based on the colours of the bindings of the two volumes from the first Oxford Conference, where the approaches were first distinguished.<ref name = \"jgswke\">Aveni 1986</ref> Green ([[Old World]]) archaeoastronomers rely heavily on statistics and are sometimes accused of missing the cultural context of what is a social practice. Brown ([[New World]]) archaeoastronomers in contrast have abundant ethnographic and historical evidence and have been described as 'cavalier' on matters of measurement and statistical analysis.<ref>Hoskin 2001:2</ref> Finding a way to integrate various approaches has been a subject of much discussion since the early 1990s.<ref>Ruggles & Saunders. 1993</ref><ref>Iwaniszewski 2001</ref>\n\n== Methodology ==\n{{quote|For a long time I have believed that such diversity requires the invention of some all-embracing theory. I think I was very na\u00efve in thinking that such a thing was ever possible.|Stanislaw Iwaniszewski<ref>Iwaniszewski 2003:7</ref>}}\n\nThere is no one way to do Archaeoastronomy. The divisions between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.\n\n===Green archaeoastronomy===\n\nGreen Archaeoastronomy is named after the cover of the book ''Archaeoastronomy in the Old World''.<ref>Aveni 1989:1</ref> It is based primarily on statistics and is particularly apt for prehistoric sites where the social evidence is relatively scant compared to the historic period. The basic methods were developed by Alexander Thom during his extensive surveys of British megalithic sites.\n\nThom wished to examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He believed that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge on the other side for a '[[double sunset]]'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a [[hypothetical]] site, one the day before the [[summer solstice]] and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset.\n\n<center>[[File:Doublesunset.ogg]]</center>\n\nTo test this idea he surveyed hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but he planned to show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing that there was an astronomical intent to the orientation of at least some of the alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two [[solstice]]s, the two [[equinox]]es and four [[cross-quarter day]]s, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar.<ref>Thom 1967: 107-117</ref> While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.\n\nEuan MacKie has supported Thom's analysis, to which he added an archaeological context by comparing [[Neolithic Britain]] to the [[Mayan civilization]] to argue for a stratified society in this period.<ref name = \"zkuawc\"/> To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland. [[Kintraw]] is a site notable for its four-meter high standing stone. Thom proposed that this was a foresight to a point on the distant horizon between Beinn Shianaidh and Beinn o'Chaolias on [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]].<ref>Ruggles 1999:25-29</ref> This, Thom argued, was a notch on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter. However, from ground level, this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape, and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters: another observation platform was needed. This was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones. The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the petrofabric analysis was inconclusive, but further research at [[Maes Howe]]<ref name=\"MacKie 1997\">MacKie 1997</ref> and on the [[Bush Barrow]] Lozenge<ref>MacKie 2006:362</ref> led MacKie to conclude that while the term 'science' may be anachronistic, Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high-accuracy alignments.<ref>MacKie 2009</ref>\n\nIn contrast [[Clive Ruggles]] has argued that there are problems with the selection of data in Thom's surveys.<ref>Ruggles 1999:19-29</ref><ref>Ruggles and Barclay 2000: 69-70</ref> Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in [[Atmospheric refraction|refraction]] near the horizon.<ref>Schaefer and Liller 1990</ref> A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer ''whether'' there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer ''why'' people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: \"To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn\u2019t inform the current interpretive questions.\"<ref>Kintigh 1992</ref>  Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.<ref>Hoskin 2001</ref>\n\n=== Brown archaeoastronomy ===\n\nIn contrast to the largely alignment-oriented statistically led methods of Green archaeoastronomy, Brown archaeoastronomy has been identified as being closer to the [[history of astronomy]] or to [[cultural history]], insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual.<ref name = \"jgswke\"/> The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.<ref>Aveni 1989</ref>\n\nOne famous site where historical records have been used to interpret sites is [[Chichen Itza]]. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]ns and then sought archaeological correlates. One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet [[Venus]]. This interest is attested to by the [[Dresden codex]] which contains tables with information about the Venus's appearances in the sky.<ref name = \"mlxqkn\">Kelley and Milone 2005:369-370</ref> These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with [[Quetzalcoatl]] or [[Xolotl]].<ref>Kelley and Milone 2005:367-8</ref> Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and probably some other Mesoamerican sites.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La estrella de Quetzalc\u00f3atl: El planeta Venus en Mesoam\u00e9rica|last=\u0160prajc|first=Ivan|publisher=Editorial Diana|year=1996|isbn=978-968-13-2947-1|location=Mexico City|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Chichen Itza Observatory 2 1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|\"El Caracol\" a possible observatory temple at Chichen Itza.]]The Temple of the Warriors bears iconography depicting feathered serpents associated with Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. This means that the building's alignment towards the place on the horizon where Venus first appears in the evening sky (when it coincides with the rainy season) may be meaningful.<ref>Milbraith 1988:70-71</ref> However, since both the date and the azimuth of this event change continuously, a solar interpretation of this orientation is much more likely.<ref>{{cite book|last1=S\u00e1nchez Nava|first1=Pedro Francisco|last2=\u0160prajc|first2=Ivan|title=Orientaciones astron\u00f3micas en la arquitectura maya de las tierras bajas|date=2015|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia|location=Mexico City|isbn=978-607-484-727-7}}</ref>\n\nAveni claims that another building associated with the planet Venus in the form of Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the [[Caracol]].<ref>Aveni 2006:60-64</ref> This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star.<ref>Aveni 1979:175-183</ref> However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing a suitable place to view out.<ref>Aveni 1997:137-138</ref>\n\nAveni states that one of the strengths of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the [[Inca]]s as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ''ceques'' radial routes emanating from the capital at [[Cusco]]. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year.<ref>Aveni 1989:5</ref><ref>Bauer and Dearborn 1995</ref> In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the [[Han dynasty]], in the second century BC.<ref>Xu ''et al.'' 2000:1-7</ref>\n\nA criticism of this method is that it can be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are.<ref>Schaefer 2006a:42-48</ref><ref>Schaefer 2006b</ref> Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy.<ref>Iwaniszewski 2003</ref> Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies are more likely to be considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like [[analogy]] and [[homology (anthropology)|homology]] and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda|first1=A.

This is based on the assumption that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.\n\nAn alignment is calculated by measuring the [[azimuth]], the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces<ref>Ruggles, 2005:112-113</ref> The azimuth is usually measured using a [[theodolite]] or a [[compass]]. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its [[magnetic declination]] must be taken into account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brunton.com/manuals/current/Compasses/Transit.pdf |format=PDF|title=Brunton Pocket Transit Instruction Manual|page=22|accessdate=2008-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304060347/http://www.brunton.com/manuals/current/Compasses/Transit.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-04}}</ref>\n\nA theodolite can be considerably more accurate if used correctly, but it is also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be [[calibration|calibrated]] using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun.<ref>Ruggles 2005:423-425</ref> Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a [[clinometer]].\n\n=== Artifacts ===\n\n[[Image:NAMA Machine d'Anticyth\u00e8re 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Antikythera mechanism (main fragment)]]For artifacts such as the [[Nebra skydisk|Sky Disc of Nebra]], alleged to be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos,<ref>Scholsser 2002</ref><ref>Meller 2004</ref> the analysis would be similar to typical [[Archaeology#Post-excavation analysis|post-excavation analysis]] as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is examined and attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.\n\nA more mundane example is the presence of [[astrological symbol]]s found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings.<ref>van Driel-Murray 2002</ref> This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice and with the historical records of the time.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAnother well-known artefact with an astronomical use is the [[Antikythera mechanism]]. In this case analysis of the artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device. The argument is bolstered by the presence of symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.<ref>T. Freeth ''et al.'' 2006</ref>\n\n=== Art and inscriptions ===\n\n[[Image:Fajadadiagram.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Diagram showing the location of the sun daggers on the [[Fajada Butte]] petroglyph on various days]]Art and inscriptions may not be confined to artefacts, but also appear painted or inscribed on an archaeological site. Sometimes inscriptions are helpful enough to give instructions to a site's use. For example, a Greek inscription on a stele (from [[Itanos (city)|Itanos]]) has been translated as:\"Patron set this up for Zeus Epopsios. Winter solstice. Should anyone wish to know: off \u2018the little pig\u2019 and the stele the sun turns.\"<ref>Inscriptiones Creticae III iv 11; Isager and Skydsgaard 1992:163</ref> From Mesoamerica come [[Maya codices|Mayan]] and [[Aztec codices]]. These are folding books made from [[Amatl]], processed tree bark on which are [[glyph]]s in [[Maya script|Mayan]] or [[Aztec script]]. The [[Dresden codex]] contains information regarding the Venus cycle, confirming its importance to the Mayans.<ref name = \"mlxqkn\"/>\n\nMore problematic are those cases where the movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with [[petroglyph]]s.<ref>Williamson 1987:109-114</ref> A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of [[Fajada Butte]] at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph.<ref>Sofaer 2008</ref> The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico.<ref>Fountain 2005</ref><ref>Robins & Ewing 1989</ref> It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices.<ref>Preston & Preston 2005: 115-118</ref> The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor [[lunar standstill]]s of the moon's 18.6 year cycle.<ref>Science Mag, Sofaer et al. 1979: 126</ref><ref name=\"Cambridge\">Cambridge U, 1982 sofaer et al.: 126</ref> In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon.<ref>Sofaer and Sinclair: 1987. UNM, ABQ</ref> Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.<ref>Sofaer 1998: Lekson Ed, u of utah: 165</ref>\n\nIf no ethnographic nor historical data are found which can support this assertion then acceptance of the idea relies upon whether or not there are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance. It is helpful when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. This allows ethnoastronomers to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols.\n\n=== Ethnographies ===\n\nAs well as the materials left by peoples themselves, there are also the reports of other who have encountered them. The historical records of the [[Conquistadores]] are a rich source of information about the pre-Columbian Americans. [[Ethnography|Ethnographers]] also provide material about many other peoples.\n\nAveni uses the importance of zenith passages as an example of the importance of ethnography. For peoples living between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn there are two days of the year when the noon Sun passes directly overhead and casts no shadow. In parts of Mesoamerica this was considered a significant day as it would herald the arrival of rains, and so play a part in the cycle of agriculture. This knowledge is still considered important amongst Mayan Indians living in Central America today. The ethnographic records suggested to archaeoastronomers that this day may have been important to the ancient Mayans. There are also shafts known as 'zenith tubes' which illuminate subterranean rooms when the sun passes overhead found at places like [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]]  and [[Xochicalco]]. It is only through the ethnography that we can speculate that the timing of the illumination was considered important in Mayan society.<ref>Aveni 1980:40-43</ref> Alignments to the sunrise and sunset on the day of the zenith passage have been claimed to exist at several sites. However, it has been shown that, since there are very few orientations that can be related to these phenomena, they likely have different explanations.<ref>\u0160prajc and S\u00e1nchez 2013</ref>\n\nEthnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At a site in [[Chaco Canyon]] can be found a [[pictograph]] with a star, crescent and hand. It has been argued by some astronomers that this is a record of the [[SN 1054|1054 Supernova]].<ref>Brandt and Williamson 1979</ref> However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general<ref>Krupp. et al. 2010: 42</ref> and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The [[Zuni people]], who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.<ref>Ruggles 2005:89</ref>\n\nEthnoastronomy is also an important field outside of the Americas. For example, anthropological work with Aboriginal Australians is producing much information about their [[Aboriginal astronomy|Indigenous astronomies]]<ref>Cairns 2005</ref><ref>Hamacher 2012</ref> and about their interaction with the modern world.<ref>Saethre 2007</ref>\n\n== Recreating the ancient sky ==\n{{quote|...[A]lthough different ways to do science and different scientific results do arise in different cultures, this provides little support for those who would use such differences to question the sciences' ability to provide reliable statements about the world in which we live.|Stephen McCluskey<ref>McCluskey 2005:78</ref>}}\n\nOnce the researcher has data to test, it is often necessary to attempt to recreate ancient sky conditions to place the data in its historical environment.\n\n=== Declination ===\n{{Main|Declination}}\n\nTo calculate what astronomical features a structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If you were to go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90\u00b0 if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or \u221290\u00b0 if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole.<ref name = \"byuqqi\">Ruggles 1999:18</ref> The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as ''declination''. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0\u00b0. The visible declinations vary depending where you are on the globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n[[Image:Decdiag600.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Diagram of the visible portions of sky at varying latitudes.]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Solar positioning ===\n\nWhile the stars are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not. The rising point of the Sun varies throughout the year. It swings between two limits marked by the solstices a bit like a [[pendulum]], slowing as it reaches the extremes, but passing rapidly through the midpoint. If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5\u00b0 then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice.<ref>A.F. Aveni 1997:23-27</ref> For more information see [[History of solar observation]].\n\n=== Lunar positioning ===\n\nThe Moon's appearance is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits \u2014 known as [[Lunar standstill|''luni''stices]] rather than ''sol''stices. However, its travel between lunistices is considerably faster. It takes a [[Sidereal month#Sidereal month|sidereal month]] to complete its cycle rather than the year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking the limits of the Moon's movement move on [[Lunar standstill|an 18.6 year cycle]]. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the limits of the range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the ''[[Lunar phase|phase]]'' of the Moon. The cycle from one [[New Moon]] to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the [[Synodic month]].<ref>Ruggles 1999:36-37</ref> Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See [[Moon]] for more details.\n\n=== Stellar positioning ===\n{{Main|Precession of the equinoxes}}\n\n[[Image:Earth precession.jpg|thumb|right|Precessional movement.]]Finally there is often a need to correct for the apparent movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a [[spinning top]]. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble.<ref>Ruggles 2005:345-347</ref> The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around [[Polaris]] as they do now. In the case of the [[Egyptian pyramids]], it has been shown they were aligned towards [[Thuban]], a faint star in the constellation of [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].<ref>Ruggles 2005:354-355</ref> The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation [[Capricornus|Capricorn]]. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].\n\n=== Transient phenomena ===\n\n[[Image:Bayeux Tapestry scene32 Halley comet.jpg|thumb|left|Halley's Comet depicted on the [[Bayeux tapestry]]]]Additionally there are often transient phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like [[eclipse]]s. In the case of [[solar eclipse]]s these can be used to date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by [[Herodotus]] enables us to date a battle between the [[Medes]] and the [[Lydia]]ns, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC.<ref>{{cite book|author=Herodotus|authorlink=Herodotus|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+1.74.1|title=The Histories I.74|accessdate=2008-03-22}}</ref> Other easily calculated events are [[supernova]]e whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.\n\nSome [[comet]]s are predictable, most famously [[Halley's Comet]]. Yet as a class of object they remain unpredictable and can appear at any time. Some have extremely lengthy [[orbital period]]s which means their past appearances and returns cannot be predicted. Others may have only ever passed through the [[Solar System]] once and so are inherently unpredictable.<ref>[http://www.space.com/spacewatch/050701_bright_comets.html Predicting the next bright comet], Space.com.</ref>\n\n[[Meteor shower]]s should be predictable, but some [[meteor]]s are cometary debris and so require calculations of orbits which are currently impossible to complete.<ref>Steel 1999</ref> Other events noted by ancients include [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]], [[sun dog]]s and [[rainbow]]s all of which are as impossible to predict as the ancient weather, but nevertheless may have been considered important phenomena.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Major topics of archaeoastronomical research ==\n{{quote|What has astronomy brought into the lives of cultural groups throughout history? The answers are many and varied...|Von Del Chamberlain and M. Jane Young<ref>Chamberlain & Young 2005:xi</ref>}}\n\n=== The use of calendars ===\n\nA common justification for the need for astronomy is the need to develop an accurate [[calendar]] for [[agriculture|agricultural]] reasons. Ancient texts like [[Hesiod]]'s Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with [[ecology|ecological]] signs, such as [[bird migration]]s to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the [[Mursi people|Mursi]] of [[Ethiopia]] shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times in some parts of the world.<ref>Turton & Ruggles 1978</ref> All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.\n\nAn example of a non-agricultural calendar is the ''[[Tzolk'in]]'' calendar of the [[Maya civilization]] of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], which is a cycle of 260 days. This count is based on an [[260-day Mesoamerican calendar|earlier calendar and is found throughout Mesoamerica]]. This formed part of a more comprehensive system of [[Maya calendar]]s which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles.<ref>Aveni 1989b</ref>\n\nOther peculiar calendars include ancient [[Hellenic calendar|Greek calendars]]. These were nominally [[Lunar calendar|lunar]], starting with the [[New Moon]]. In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates by both the civic calendar and ''ton theoi'', by the [[moon]].<ref>McCluskey 2000</ref> The lack of any universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as [[Panhellenic Games|games]] or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism may have been used as a politically neutral form of timekeeping.<ref>Salt & Boutsikas 2005</ref> Orientation measurements in Greek temples and Byzantine churches have been associated to deity's name day, festivities, and special events.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Liritzis | first1 = I | last2 = Vassiliou | first2 = H | date = 2002 | title = Astronomical orientations of ancient temples at Rhodes and Attica with a tentative interpretation | journal = Mediterranean Archaeology & Archaeometry | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 69\u201379 | bibcode = 2002MAA.....2...69L }}</ref><ref>Liritzis.I and Vassiliou.H (2006) Were Greek temples oriented towards aurora?

A preliminary study.

In these cultures [[mythology|myth]] was a tool for achieving this and the explanations, while not reflecting the standards of modern [[science]], are [[cosmology|cosmologies]].\n\nThe [[Inca]]s arranged their empire to demonstrate their cosmology. The capital, [[Cusco]], was at the centre of the empire and connected to it by means of ceques, conceptually straight lines radiating out from the centre.<ref>Bauer & Dearborn 1995</ref> These ceques connected the centre of the empire to the four ''suyus'', which were regions defined by their direction from Cusco. The notion of a quartered cosmos is common across the [[Andes]]. Gary Urton, who has conducted fieldwork in the Andean villagers of Misminay, has connected this quartering with the appearance of the [[Milky Way]] in the night sky.<ref>Urton 1981</ref> In one season it will bisect the sky and in another bisect it in a [[perpendicular]] fashion.\n\nThe importance of observing cosmological factors is also seen on the other side of the world. The [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]] is laid out to follow cosmic order though rather than observing four directions. The Chinese system was composed of five directions: [[North]], [[South]], [[East]], [[West]] and [[Centre (geometry)|Centre]]. The Forbidden City occupied the centre of ancient Beijing.<ref>Krupp 1997a:196\u20139</ref> One approaches the Emperor from the south, thus placing him in front of the [[Circumpolar constellation|circumpolar stars]]. This creates the situation of the heavens revolving around the person of the Emperor. The Chinese cosmology is now better known through its export as [[feng shui]].\n\nThere is also much information about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the [[constellation]]s. The Barasana of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees.<ref>Hoskin 1999:15\u20136</ref> The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.<ref>Hugh-Jones 1982:191-3</ref>\n\nA more well-known source of constellation myth are the texts of the Greeks and Romans. The origin of their constellations remains a matter of vigorous and occasionally fractious debate.<ref>Schaefer 2002</ref><ref>Blomberg 2003, esp page 76</ref>\n\nThe loss of one of the sisters, Merope, in some Greek myths may reflect an astronomical event wherein one of the stars in the Pleiades disappeared from view by the naked eye.<ref>[http://www.pleiade.org/pleiades_02.html ''The Pleiades in mythology''], Pleiade Associates, Bristol, United Kingdom, accessed June 7, 2012</ref>\n\n[[Giorgio de Santillana]], professor of the History of Science in the School of Humanities at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], along with Hertha von Dechend believed that the old mythological stories handed down from antiquity were not random fictitious tales but were accurate depictions of celestial [[cosmology]] clothed in tales to aid their oral transmission. The chaos, monsters and violence in ancient myths are representative of the forces that shape each age. They believed that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate [[astronomy]] that became lost with the rise of the Greco-Roman civilization. Santillana and von Dechend in their book ''Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time'' (1969) clearly state that ancient myths have no historical or factual basis other than a cosmological one encoding astronomical phenomena, especially the [[precession of the equinoxes]].<ref>Giorgio de Santillana & Hertha von Dechend, ''Hamlet's Mill'', David R Godine: Boston, 1977.</ref> Santillana and von Dechend's approach is not widely accepted.\n\n=== Displays of power ===\n\n[[Image:1st Pylon Karnak Temple.JPG|thumbnail|250px|left|The [[Precinct of Amun-Re]] was aligned on the midwinter solstice.]]\n\nBy including celestial motifs in clothing it becomes possible for the wearer to make claims the power on Earth is drawn from above. It has been said that the Shield of [[Achilles]] described by [[Homer]] is also a catalogue of constellations.<ref>Hannah 1994</ref> In North America shields depicted in [[Comanche]] [[petroglyph]]s appear to include Venus symbolism.<ref>Krupp 1997a:252\u20133</ref>\n\n[[Solstice|Solsticial]] alignments also can be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the [[Isla del Sol|Island of the Sun]] (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in [[Lake Titicaca]], the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the [[Inca]] ruling elite. Ordinary [[Pilgrimage|pilgrims]] stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.<ref>Dearborn, Seddon & Bauer, 1998</ref>\n\nIn Egypt the temple of [[Amun-Re]] at [[Karnak]] has been the subject of much study. Evaluation of the site, taking into account the change over time of the [[obliquity of the ecliptic]] show that the Great Temple was aligned on the rising of the midwinter sun.<ref>Krupp 1988</ref> The length of the corridor down which sunlight would travel would have limited illumination at other times of the year.\n\nIn a later period the [[Serapeum]] in [[Alexandria]] was also said to have contained a [[Sun|solar]] alignment so that, on a specific sunrise, a shaft of light would pass across the lips of the statue of [[Serapis]] thus symbolising the [[Sun]] saluting the god.<ref>Rufinus</ref>\n\n== Major sites of archaeoastronomical interest ==\n{{Main|List of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country}}\n\n[[Clive Ruggles]] and [[Michel Cotte]] recently edited a book on heritage sites of astronomy and archaeoastronomy that provides a list of the main sites around the world.<ref>Clive Ruggles and Michel Cotte (ed.), Heritage Sites of Astronomy and Archaeoastronomy.

Instead it enters via a hollow box above the main doorway discovered by Michael O'Kelly.<ref>O'Kelly 1982:123-124</ref> It is this roofbox which strongly indicates that the tomb was built with an astronomical aspect in mind.

The observation of lunar cycles is also evident.\n\n=== El Castillo ===\n{{Main|El Castillo, Chichen Itza}}\n\nEl Castillo, also known as Kukulc\u00e1n's Pyramid, is a [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Mesoamerican step-pyramid]] built in the centre of [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n center of [[Chichen Itza]] in Mexico. Several architectural features have suggested astronomical elements. Each of the stairways built into the sides of the pyramid has 91 steps. Along with the extra one for the platform at the top, this totals 365 steps, which is possibly one for each day of the year (365.25) or the number of lunar orbits in 10,000 rotations (365.01).\n\n[[Image:Serpent head at the base of El Castillo.jpg|left|thumb|Plumed Serpent]]\nA visually striking effect is seen every March and September as an unusual shadow occurs around the equinoxes. A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade of the northern stairway. The visual effect is of a serpent descending the stairway, with its head at the base in light. Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May, traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season.<ref>Krupp 1997a:267-269</ref> The intended alignment was, however, likely incorporated in the northern (main) facade of the temple, as it corresponds to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, recorded also by the central axis of Castillo at Tulum.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=\u0160prajc |first1=Ivan |last2=S\u00e1nchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=Astronom\u00eda en la arquitectura de Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1: una reevaluaci\u00f3n |journal=Estudios de Cultura Maya |date=2013 |volume=XLI |pages=31\u201360}}</ref> The two dates are separated by 65 and 300 days, and it has been shown that the solar orientations in Mesoamerica regularly correspond to dates separated by calendrically significant intervals (multiples of 13 and 20 days).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=\u0160prajc|first1=I.|title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica|journal=Journal of Archaeological Research|volume=26|issue=2|pages=197\u2013251|date=2018|doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Stonehenge ===\n[[Image:Summer Solstice Sunrise over Stonehenge 2005.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The sun rising over [[Stonehenge]] at the 2005 Summer [[Solstice]].]]\n\n{{Main|Archaeoastronomy and Stonehenge}}\n\nMany astronomical alignments have been claimed for Stonehenge, a complex of [[megalith]]s and [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]]s in the [[Salisbury Plain]] of England. The most famous of these is the midsummer alignment, where the Sun rises over the Heel Stone. However, this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter alignment, where the viewer is outside Stonehenge and sees the sun setting in the henge, is the more significant alignment, and the midsummer alignment may be a coincidence due to local topography.<ref>Parker Pearson ''et al.'' 2007</ref>\n\nAs well as solar alignments, there are proposed lunar alignments.

In the 1990s further investigations were carried out to discover whether this was an accurate or an approximate solar alignment. Several new aspects of the site were discovered. In the first place the entrance passage faces the hills of the island [[Hoy]], about 10 miles away. Secondly, it consists of two straight lengths, angled at a few degrees to each other. Thirdly, the outer part is aligned towards the midwinter sunset position on a level horizon just to the left of Ward Hill on Hoy.  Fourthly the inner part points directly at the Barnhouse standing stone about 400m away and then to the right end of the summit of Ward Hill, just before it dips down to the notch between it at Cuilags to the right. This indicated line points to  sunset on the first Sixteenths of the solar year (according to A. Thom) before and after the winter solstice and the notch at the base of the right slope of the Hill is at the same declination. Fourthly a similar 'double sunset' phenomenon is seen at the right end of Cuilags, also on Hoy; here the date is the first Eighth of the year before and after the winter solstice, at the beginning of November and February respectively \u2013 the Old Celtic festivals of [[Samhain]] and [[Imbolc]]. This alignment is not indicated by an artificial structure but gains plausibility from the other two indicated lines.   Maeshowe is thus an extremely sophisticated calendar site which must have been positioned carefully in order to use the horizon foresights in the ways described.<ref name=\"MacKie 1997\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Uxmal ===\n[[Image:Uxmal-Palace-of-the-Governor.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Palace of the Governor at Uxmal.]]\n\n{{Main|Uxmal}}\n\nUxmal is a Mayan city in the Puuc Hills of [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]], Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal is often used as an exemplar of why it is important to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an [[azimuth]] of 118\u00b0 on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius ''et cetera''? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in [[glyph]]s which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations.<ref>Ruggles 2005:163-165</ref> Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.<ref>\u0160prajc 2015</ref>\n\n=== Chaco Canyon ===\n[[Image:Chaco Canyon Chetro Ketl great kiva plaza NPS.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Great Kiva at Chaco Canyon.]]\n\nIn Chaco Canyon, the center of the ancient Pueblo culture in the American Southwest, numerous solar and lunar light markings and architectural and road alignments have been documented.

During the 1930s, Otto S. Reuter compiled a study entitled ''Germanische Himmelskunde'', or \"Teutonic Skylore\". The astronomical orientations of ancient monuments claimed by Reuter and his followers would place the ancient Germanic peoples ahead of the [[Ancient Near East]] in the field of astronomy, demonstrating the intellectual superiority of the \"[[Aryan race|Aryans]]\" (Indo-Europeans) over the [[Semitic people|Semites]].<ref>Pedersen 1982:269</ref>\n\nSince the 19th century, numerous scholars have sought to use [[Archaeoastronomy and Vedic chronology|archaeoastronomical calculations]] to demonstrate the antiquity of Ancient Indian Vedic culture, computing the dates of astronomical observations ambiguously described in ancient poetry to as early as 4000 BCE.<ref>Witzel 2001</ref>  [[David Pingree]], a historian of Indian astronomy, condemned \"the scholars who perpetrate wild theories of prehistoric science and call themselves archaeoastronomers.\"<ref>Pingree 1982:554-563, esp. p. 556</ref>\n\nMore recently Gallagher,<ref>Gallagher 1983</ref> Pyle,<ref>Pyle 1983</ref> and [[Barry Fell|Fell]]<ref>Fell 1983</ref> interpreted inscriptions in West Virginia as a description in Celtic [[Ogham]] alphabet of the supposed winter solstitial marker at the site.

Subsequent analyses criticized its cultural inappropriateness, as well as its linguistic and archeaoastronomical<ref>Wise 2003</ref> claims, to describe it as an example of \"[[Pseudoarchaeology|cult archaeology]]\".<ref>Lesser, 1983</ref>\n\nArchaeoastronomy is sometimes related to the fringe discipline of [[Archaeocryptography]], when its followers attempt to find underlying mathematical orders beneath the proportions, size, and placement of archaeoastronomical sites such as Stonehenge and the Pyramid of Kukulc\u00e1n at Chichen Itza.<ref>{{citation | last = Schmeh | first = Klaus| title = The Pathology of Cryptology\u2014A Current Survey | journal = Cryptologia | volume= 36 | date = 2012 | pages = 14\u201345 | doi = 10.1080/01611194.2011.632803 | postscript = , at pp. 19-20.}}</ref>\n\n== Archaeoastronomical organisations and publications ==\n\nThere are currently three academic organisations for scholars of archaeoastronomy.

He started his literary career as a translator, in particular, of science fiction. He says he wrote his first [[short story]], \"[[The Witcher]]\" (\"Wied\u017amin\", also translated \"The Hexer\" or \"Spellmaker\") on a whim, in order to enter a contest by Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine ''[[Fantastyka]]''. In an interview he said that being a businessman at the time and thus familiar with marketing, he knew how to sell, and indeed, he won the 3rd prize.<ref>[http://www.mirf.ru/Articles/art934.htm \u041d\u041e \u041c\u042b \u0416\u0415 \u0421\u041b\u0410\u0412\u042f\u041d\u0415! \u0420\u0410\u0417\u0413\u041e\u0412\u041e\u0420 \u0421 \u0410\u041d\u0414\u0416\u0415\u0415\u041c \u0421\u0410\u041f\u041a\u041e\u0412\u0421\u041a\u0418\u041c], An interview with Sapkowski for Russian monthly magazine \"World of Fatnastics\"</ref> The story was published in ''Fantastyka'' in 1986 and  was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a [[Novel sequence|cycle of tales]] based on the world of \"The Witcher\", comprising three collections of short stories and five novels. This cycle and his many other works have made him one of the best-known [[fantasy author]]s in Poland in the 1990s.<ref name=mo/>\n\nThe main character of \"The Witcher\" is [[Geralt of Rivia]], a monster hunter trained for this since childhood. Geralt exists in a morally ambiguous universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics.

Electric currents are measured in [[ampere]]s (A), hence the name. Instruments used to measure smaller currents, in the milliampere or microampere range, are designated as ''milliammeters'' or ''microammeters''. Early ammeters were laboratory instruments which relied on the Earth's magnetic field for operation. By the late 19th century, improved instruments were designed which could be mounted in any position and allowed accurate measurements in [[electric power system]]s. It is generally represented by letter 'A' in a circle. Ammeters have very low resistance and are always connected in series in any circuit.\n\n==History==\nThe relation between electric current, magnetic fields and physical forces was first noted by [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] who, in 1820, observed a [[compass]] needle was deflected from pointing North when a current flowed in an adjacent wire. The [[Galvanometer#Tangent_galvanometer|tangent galvanometer]] was used to measure currents using this effect, where the restoring force returning the pointer to the zero position was provided by the Earth's magnetic field. This made these instruments usable only when aligned with the Earth's field. Sensitivity of the instrument was increased by using additional turns of wire to multiply the effect \u2013 the instruments were called \"multipliers\".<ref>L. A. Geddes, ''Looking back: how measuring electric current has improved through the ages'', ''IEEE Potentials'', Feb/Mar 1996, pages 40-42</ref>\n\nThe word ''rheoscope'' as a detector of electrical currents was coined by Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]] about 1840 but is no longer used to describe electrical instruments.  The word makeup is similar to that of ''[[rheostat]]'' (also coined by Wheatstone) which was a device used to adjust the current in a circuit.  Rheostat is a historical term for a variable resistance, though unlike rheoscope may still be encountered.<ref>Brian Bowers (ed.), ''Sir Charles Wheatstone FRS: 1802-1875'', IET, 2001 {{ISBN|0-85296-103-0}} pp.104-105</ref><ref>{{LSJ|r(e/os|\u1fe5\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}}, {{LSJ|i(/sthmi|\u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9|ref}}.</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n=== Moving-coil ===\nThe [[D'Arsonval galvanometer]] is a moving coil ammeter. It uses [[magnetism|magnetic]] [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]], where current passing through a coil placed in the [[magnetic field]] of a permanent magnet causes the coil to move. The modern form of this instrument was developed by [[Edward Weston (chemist)|Edward Weston]], and uses two spiral springs to provide the restoring force. The uniform air gap between the iron core and the permanent magnet poles make the deflection of the meter linearly proportional to current. These meters have linear scales.  Basic meter movements can have full-scale deflection for currents from about 25 [[microampere]]s to 10 [[milliampere]]s.<ref name=Spitzer72/>\n\nBecause the magnetic field is polarised, the meter needle acts in opposite directions for each direction of current. A DC ammeter is thus sensitive to which way round it is connected; most are marked with a positive terminal, but some have centre-zero mechanisms<ref group=\"note\" >The needle's resting position is in the centre of the scale and the restoring spring can act equally well in either direction.</ref> and can display currents in either direction. A moving coil meter indicates the average (mean) of a varying current through it,<ref group=\"note\" >provided that its frequency is faster than the meter can respond to</ref> which is zero for AC. For this reason moving-coil meters are only usable directly for DC, not AC.\n\nThis type of meter movement is extremely common for both ammeters and other meters derived from them, such as [[voltmeter]]s and [[ohmmeter]]s.\n\n=== Moving magnet ===\n\nMoving magnet ammeters operate on essentially the same principle as moving coil, except that the coil is mounted in the meter case, and a permanent magnet moves the needle. Moving magnet Ammeters are able to carry larger currents than moving coil instruments, often several tens of Amperes, because the coil can be made of thicker wire and the current does not have to be carried by the hairsprings.\nIndeed, some Ammeters of this type do not have hairsprings at all, instead using a fixed permanent magnet to provide the restoring force.\n\n=== Electrodynamic ===\nAn electrodynamic movement uses an electromagnet instead of the permanent magnet of the d'Arsonval movement. This instrument can respond to both alternating and direct current<ref name=Spitzer72/> and also indicates [[true RMS]] for AC.  See [[Wattmeter]] for an alternative use for this instrument.\n\n=== Moving-iron ===\nMoving iron ammeters use a piece of [[iron]] which moves when acted upon by the electromagnetic force of a fixed coil of wire. The moving-iron meter was invented by [[Austria]]n engineer [[Friedrich Drexler]] in 1884.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technischesmuseum.at/objekt/fragebogen-aus-der-personenmappe-friedrich-drexler-1858-1945|title=Fragebogen aus der Personenmappe Friedrich Drexler (1858 - 1945)|publisher=Technisches Museum Wien|accessdate=2013-07-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201512/http://www.technischesmuseum.at/objekt/fragebogen-aus-der-personenmappe-friedrich-drexler-1858-1945|archivedate=2013-10-29|df=}}</ref> This type of meter responds to both [[direct current|direct]] and [[alternating current]]s (as opposed to the moving-coil ammeter, which works on [[direct current]] only). The iron element consists of a moving vane attached to a pointer, and a fixed vane, surrounded by a coil. As alternating or direct current flows through the coil and induces a magnetic field in both vanes, the vanes repel each other and the moving vane deflects against the restoring force provided by fine helical springs.<ref name=Spitzer72/> The deflection of a moving iron meter is proportional to the square of the current.  Consequently, such meters would normally have a non linear scale, but the iron parts are usually modified in shape to make the scale fairly linear over most of its range.  Moving iron instruments indicate the [[Root mean square|RMS]] value of any AC waveform applied. Moving iron ammeters are commonly used to measure current in industrial frequency AC circuits.\n\n=== Hot-wire ===\nIn a hot-wire ammeter, a current passes through a wire which expands as it heats. Although these instruments have slow response time and low accuracy, they were sometimes used in measuring radio-frequency current.<ref name=Spitzer72>Frank Spitzer and Barry Howarth, Principles of Modern Instrumentation, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York, 1972, {{ISBN|0-03-080208-3}} chapter 11</ref>  These also measure true RMS for an applied AC.\n\n=== Digital ===\nIn much the same way as the analogue ammeter formed the basis for a wide variety of derived meters, including voltmeters, the basic mechanism for a digital meter is a digital voltmeter mechanism, and other types of meter are built around this.\n\nDigital ammeter designs use a [[shunt resistor]] to produce a calibrated voltage proportional to the current flowing. This voltage is then measured by a digital voltmeter, through use of an [[analog to digital converter]] (ADC); the digital display is calibrated to display the current through the shunt. Such instruments are often calibrated to indicate the RMS value for a sine wave only, but many designs will indicate true RMS within limitations of the wave [[crest factor]].\n\n=== Integrating ===\n[[File:DC Electric Meter.JPG|thumb|An integrating current meter calibrated in Ampere-hours or charge]]\nThere is also a range of devices referred to as integrating ammeters.<ref>http://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/lc/local/notes/dr/Wiggler/Wigrad_BK.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dit.upc.es/lpdntt/biblio/BREUS/LEE97a.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720145617/http://dit.upc.es/lpdntt/biblio/BREUS/LEE97a.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}</ref> In these ammeters the current is summed over time, giving as a result the product of current and time; which is proportional to the electrical charge transferred with that current. These can be used for metering energy (the charge needs to be multiplied by the voltage to give energy) or for estimating the charge of a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[capacitor]].\n\n==Picoammeter==\nA picoammeter, or pico ammeter, measures very low electric current, usually from the picoampere range at the lower end to the milliampere range at the upper end. Picoammeters are used for sensitive measurements where the current being measured is below the theoretical limits of sensitivity of other devices, such as [[Multimeter]]s.\n\nMost picoammeters use a \"virtual short\" technique and have several different measurement ranges that must be switched between to cover multiple [[Decade (log scale)|decades of measurement]]. Other modern picoammeters use [[Logarithmic scale|log compression]] and a \"current sink\" method that eliminates range switching and associated [[voltage spike]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ix Innovations, LLC\n|url = http://pocketpico.com/pdf/pp_theoryofoperation.pdf\n|accessdate = 2014-07-11|title=PocketPico Ammeter Theory of Operation}}</ref> Special design and usage considerations must be observed in order to reduce leakage current which may swamp measurements such as special insulators and [[driven shield]]s. [[Triaxial cable]] is often used for probe connections.\n\n==Application==\nThe majority of ammeters are either connected in series with the circuit carrying the current to be measured (for small fractional amperes), or have their shunt resistors connected similarly in series. In either case, the current passes through the meter or (mostly) through its shunt. Ammeters must not be connected directly across a voltage source since their internal resistance is very low and excess current would flow. Ammeters are designed for a low [[voltage drop]] across their terminals, much less than one volt; the extra circuit losses produced by the ammeter are called its \"burden\" on the measured circuit. \n\nOrdinary Weston-type meter movements can measure only milliamperes at most, because the springs and practical coils can carry only limited currents. To measure larger currents, a [[resistor]] called a ''[[shunt (electrical)#Use in current measuring|shunt]]'' is placed in [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]] with the meter. The resistances of shunts is in the integer to fractional milliohm range. Nearly all of the current flows through the shunt, and only a small fraction flows through the meter. This allows the meter to measure large currents. Traditionally, the meter used with a shunt has a full-scale deflection (FSD) of {{nowrap|50 mV}}, so shunts are typically designed to produce a voltage drop of {{nowrap|50 mV}} when carrying their full rated current.\n\n[[File:Ayrton-shunt.jpg|thumb|Ayrton shunt switching principle]]\nTo make a multi-range ammeter, a selector switch can be used to connect one of a number of shunts across the meter. It must be a make-before-break switch to avoid damaging current surges through the meter movement when switching ranges.\n\nA better arrangement is the [[Ayrton shunt]] or universal shunt, invented by [[William E. Ayrton]], which does not require a make-before-break switch. It also avoids any inaccuracy because of contact resistance. In the figure, assuming for example, a movement with a full-scale voltage of 50 mV and desired current ranges of 10 mA, 100 mA, and 1 A, the resistance values would be: R1=4.5 ohms, R2=0.45 ohm, R3=0.05 ohm. And if the movement resistance is 1000 ohms, for example, R1 must be adjusted to 4.525 ohms.\n\nSwitched shunts are rarely used for currents above 10 amperes.\n\nZero-center ammeters are used for applications requiring current to be measured with both polarities, common in scientific and industrial equipment. Zero-center ammeters are also commonly placed in series with a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. In this application, the charging of the battery deflects the needle to one side of the scale (commonly, the right side) and the discharging of the battery deflects the needle to the other side. A special type of zero-center ammeter for testing high currents in cars and trucks has a pivoted bar magnet that moves the pointer, and a fixed bar magnet to keep the pointer centered with no current. The magnetic field around the wire carrying current to be measured deflects the moving magnet.\n\nSince the ammeter [[Shunt_(electrical)#Use_in_current_measuring|shunt]] has a very low resistance, mistakenly wiring the ammeter in parallel with a voltage source will cause a [[short circuit]], at best blowing a fuse, possibly damaging the instrument and wiring, and exposing an observer to injury.\n\nIn AC circuits, a [[current transformer]] converts the magnetic field around a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] into a small AC current, typically either {{nowrap|1 A}} or {{nowrap|5 A}} at full rated current, that can be easily read by a meter. In a similar way, accurate AC/DC non-contact ammeters have been constructed using [[Hall effect]] magnetic field sensors. A portable hand-held [[clamp meter|clamp-on ammeter]] is a common tool for maintenance of industrial and commercial electrical equipment, which is temporarily clipped over a wire to measure current. Some recent types have a parallel pair of magnetically soft probes that are placed on either side of the conductor.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Clamp meter]]\n*[[Class of accuracy in electrical measurements]]\n*[[Electric circuit]]\n*[[Electrical measurements]]\n*[[Electronics]]\n*[[List of electronics topics]]\n*[[Measurement category]]\n*[[Multimeter]]\n*[[Ohmmeter]]\n*[[Rheoscope]]\n*[[Voltmeter]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note|liststyle=lower-roman}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Ammeters}}\n* [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/DC/DC_8.html ''DC Metering Circuits''] chapter from [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/DC/index.html ''Lessons In Electric Circuits Vol 1 DC''] free ebook and [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/ ''Lessons In Electric Circuits''] series.\n\n{{Electrical and electronic measuring equipment}}\n\n[[Category:Electrical meters]]\n[[Category:Electronic test equipment]]\n[[Category:Flow meters]]", "sha1": "54mgwgszxxpodq824vdqx0fxy4t6ndk"}}, {"title": "Amanda Hesser", "ns": "0", "id": "2868", "revision": {"id": "863923476", "parentid": "860909804", "timestamp": "2018-10-14T00:00:59Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* top */[[WP:GenFixes]] on, [[WP:AWB/T|typo(s) fixed]]: t\u2019s \u2192 t's (2)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox person\n| name          = \n| image         = Amanda Hesser by James Ransom.jpg\n| alt           = \n| caption       = Amanda Hesser in the offices of Food52\n| birth_name    = \n| birth_date    =  {{birth year and age|1971}}\n| birth_place   = \n| death_date    = <!-- {{Death date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|YYYY|MM|DD}} (death date then birth date) -->\n| death_place   = \n| nationality   = [[United States|American]]\n| other_names   = \n| occupation    = \n| years_active  = \n| known_for     = \n| notable_works = \n}}\n'''Amanda Hesser''' (born 1971) is an American food writer, editor, cookbook author and entrepreneur.

Like barbiturates, therapeutic doses produce sedation and significant overdoses may be fatal. In the US, meprobamate has generally been replaced with benzodiazepines while the drug is now withdrawn in many European countries and Canada.

They have a very high potential for abuse and have one of the highest addiction rates for all drugs.  Many people become addicted to these drugs because they are so effective at blocking emotional pain, including anxiety.  Similarly to alcohol, people with anxiety disorders are more likely to become addicted to opioids due to their anxiolytic effect.  These drugs range from the commonly prescribed [[hydrocodone]], to the often illegal [[Diamorphine]], and all the way to much more potent varieties like [[fentanyl]] often used in trauma or end of life pain management. Most people purchasing these drugs illegally are seeking them out to get a euphoric like high, but many others seek them out because they are so effective at reducing both physical pain and emotional pain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heroin addiction and anxiety disorder|url=http://www.dualdiagnosis.org/heroin-and-anxiety-disorder|website=DualDiagnosis|accessdate=16 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nBecause of their potential for abuse, prescribing opioids for mental health issues is uncommon and frowned upon within the medical community. Those opioids which are less likely to be abused, have other drug interactions, and to result in overdose are being examined for their anxiolytic properties. Given that anxiety sufferers are prone to both alcohol and opioid addiction, the danger in prescribing opioids is obvious. Benzodiazepines have effects similar to those of alcohol and although anxiety sufferers are at risk of becoming addicted to them, they are still prescribed.  The same logic is being used to have opioids used for anxiety treatment. Opioids and benzodiazepines used  together are dangerous and are one of the most common reasons for accidental mixed drug overdose in the United States, so caution must be taken if opioid prescriptions for anxiety become more accepted.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIt appears that [[buprenorphine]] is gaining some acceptability within the medical community for treating  anxiety, OCD, and depression.  Buprenorphine is similar to methadone in that it is used in opioid replacement therapy as well as pain management.  It is safer than methadone and other opioids and has a very long half-life leading to less compulsive use among those who attempt to abuse it or have become dependant on it.  There has been research into more commonly abused opioids being prescribed for anxiety disorder, but given that these drugs produce more euphoria and require more constant dosing when compared to buprenorphine, there is a much higher danger for abuse and overdose.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/2045125312462233 |pmid=23983988 |pmc=3736962 |title=Buprenorphine augmentation in the treatment of refractory obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder |journal=Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=15\u20139 |year=2013 |last1=Liddell |first1=Malcolm B. |last2=Aziz |first2=Victor |last3=Briggs |first3=Patrick |last4=Kanakkehewa |first4=Nimalee |last5=Rawi |first5=Omar }}</ref>\n\n=== Antidepressants ===\nAntidepressant medications can reduce anxiety, and several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been [[Food and Drug Administration|USFDA]] approved to treat various anxiety disorders.

This means that dopamine released in these pathways has less effect. Excess release of dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] has been linked to psychotic experiences. Decreased dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, and excess dopamine release in other pathways, are associated with psychotic episodes in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pickar D, Litman RE, Konicki PE, Wolkowitz OM, Breier A | title = Neurochemical and neural mechanisms of positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia | journal = Modern Problems of Pharmacopsychiatry | volume = 24 | issue =  | pages = 124\u201351 | year = 1990 | pmid = 1970851 | doi =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liemburg EJ, Knegtering H, Klein HC, Kortekaas R, Aleman A | title = Antipsychotic medication and prefrontal cortex activation: a review of neuroimaging findings | journal = European Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 387\u2013400 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22300864 | doi = 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2011.12.008 }}</ref>\nIn addition to the antagonistic effects of dopamine, antipsychotics (in particular atypical neuroleptics) also antagonize [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors]].

Blocking D<sub>2</sub> receptors in these other pathways is thought to produce some unwanted [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] that the typical antipsychotics can produce (see above). They were commonly classified on a spectrum of low potency to high potency, where potency referred to the ability of the drug to bind to dopamine receptors, and not to the effectiveness of the drug. High-potency antipsychotics such as [[haloperidol]], in general, have doses of a few milligrams and cause less sleepiness and calming effects than low-potency antipsychotics such as [[chlorpromazine]] and [[thioridazine]], which have dosages of several hundred milligrams. The latter have a greater degree of anticholinergic and antihistaminergic activity, which can counteract dopamine-related side-effects.\n\n[[Atypical antipsychotic]] drugs have a similar blocking effect on D<sub>2</sub> receptors, however, most also act on serotonin receptors, especially [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] and [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]] receptors. Both clozapine and quetiapine appear to bind just long enough to elicit antipsychotic effects but not long enough to induce extrapyramidal side effects and prolactin hypersecretion.<ref name=Atypicality>{{cite journal|last=Stahl|first=SM|title=Describing an Atypical Antipsychotic: Receptor Binding and Its Role in Pathophysiology|journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry|year=2003|volume=5|issue=Suppl. 3|pages=9\u201313|url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v05s03/v05s0302.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016080356/http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v05s03/v05s0302.pdf|archivedate=16 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> antagonism increases dopaminergic activity in the [[nigrostriatal pathway]], leading to a lowered extrapyramidal side effect liability among the atypical antipsychotics.<ref name = Atypicality /><ref>{{cite book|name-list-format=vanc|last1=Gross|first1=Gerhard|last2=Geyer|first2=Mark A.|title=Current Antipsychotics|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-25761-2|pages=88\u201389|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-25761-2/page/1|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131013075059/http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-25761-2/page/1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-10-13|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-25761-2}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison of medications==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"font-size:small; width:100%;\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | Overview\n|-\n!

'Thorazine' is especially effective when the psychotic episode is triggered by delusions or hallucinations. At the outset of treatment, Thorazine's combination of antipsychotic and sedative effects provides both emotional and physical calming. Assaultive or destructive behavior is rapidly controlled. As therapy continues, the initial sedative effect gradually disappears. But the antipsychotic effect continues, helping to dispel or modify delusions, hallucinations and confusion, while keeping the patient calm and approachable. SMITH KLINE AND FRENCH LABORATORIES leaders in psychopharmaceutical research.\"</ref>]]\n\nThe original antipsychotic drugs were happened upon largely by chance and then tested for their effectiveness. The first, [[chlorpromazine]], was developed as a surgical [[anesthetic]]. It was first used on psychiatric patients because of its powerful calming effect; at the time it was regarded as a non-permanent \"pharmacological [[lobotomy]]\".<ref name=pieters>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pieters T, Majerus B | title = The introduction of chlorpromazine in Belgium and the Netherlands (1951-1968); tango between old and new treatment features | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 443\u201352 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22035718 | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsc.2011.05.003 | url = http://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/2251 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170709194021/http://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/2251 | df = dmy-all | deadurl = no | archivedate = 9 July 2017 }}</ref> Lobotomy at the time was used to treat many behavioral disorders, including psychosis, although its effect was to markedly reduce behavior and mental functioning of all types. However, chlorpromazine proved to reduce the effects of psychosis in a more effective and specific manner than lobotomy, even though it was known to be capable of causing severe sedation. The underlying [[neurochemistry]] involved has since been studied in detail, and subsequent antipsychotic drugs have been discovered by an approach that incorporates this sort of information.\n\nThe discovery of chlorpromazine's psychoactive effects in 1952 led to further research that resulted in the development of [[antidepressant]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s, and the majority of other drugs now used in the management of psychiatric conditions. In 1952, [[Henri Laborit]] described chlorpromazine only as inducing indifference towards what was happening around them in nonpsychotic, nonmanic patients, and [[Jean Delay]] and [[Pierre Deniker]] described it as controlling manic or psychotic agitation. The former claimed to have discovered a treatment for agitation in anyone, and the latter team claimed to have discovered a treatment for psychotic illness.<ref>Healy, D. 2005.

September 1771{{snd}}30 April 1847) was an [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]n field-marshal, the third son of [[Emperor Leopold II]]<nowiki/> and his wife, [[Maria Luisa of Spain]]. He was also the younger brother of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Despite being [[epilepsy|epileptic]], Charles achieved respect both as a commander and as a reformer of the Austrian army. He was considered one of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon's]] more formidable opponents.<ref>[[Eugene Tarle]], Napoleon.</ref>\n\nHe began his career fighting the revolutionary armies of France. Early in the wars of the [[First Coalition]], he saw victory at [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Neerwinden]] in 1793, before being defeated at [[Battle of Wattignies|Wattignies]] 1793 and [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] 1794. In 1796, as chief of all Austrian forces on the [[Rhine]], Charles defeated [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] at [[Battle of Amberg|Amberg]] and [[Battle of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]], and then won a victory at [[Battle of Emmendingen|Emmendingen]] that forced [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau]] to withdraw across the Rhine. He also defeated opponents at [[First Battle of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]], [[Battle of Ostrach|Ostrach]], [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach]], and [[Battle of Messkirch|Messkirch]] in 1799. He reformed Austria's armies to adopt the nation-at-arms principle. In 1809, he entered the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]] and inflicted Napoleon's first major setback at [[Battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern-Essling]], before suffering a defeat at the bloody [[Battle of Wagram]]. After Wagram, Charles saw no more significant action in the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nAs a military strategist, Charles was able to successfully execute complex and risky maneuvers of troops. However, his contemporary [[Carl von Clausewitz]] criticize his rigidity and adherence to \"geographic\" strategy.\n\nAustrians nevertheless remember Charles as a hero of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.\n\n==Youth and early career==\n[[File:Charles, Archduke of Austria - Lawrence 1819.jpg|thumb|Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen]]\nCharles was born in [[Florence]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]]. His father, then Grand Duke of Tuscany, generously permitted Charles's childless aunt [[Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen|Archduchess Marie Christine of Austria]] and her husband [[Albert of Saxe-Teschen]] to adopt and raise the boy in Vienna. Charles spent his youth in [[Tuscany]], at [[Vienna]] and in the Austrian Netherlands, where he began his career of military service in the [[French Revolutionary Wars|wars of the French Revolution]]. He commanded a brigade at the [[Battle of Jemappes]] (1792), and in the campaign of 1793 distinguished himself at the [[Battle of Aldenhoven (1794)|Action of Aldenhoven]] and the [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Battle of Neerwinden]]. In this year he became [[List of governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands]], an office he lost with the  occupation of the Low Countries by the French revolutionaries in 1794. The year he became Governor he also received the army rank of [[Lieutenant Field Marshal]]. Shortly thereafter another promotion saw him made ''[[Feldzeugmeister]]'' (equivalent of Lieutenant General). In the remainder of the war in the [[Low Countries]] he held high commands, and was present at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]] (1794).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=935}}\n\nIn 1795 he served on the Rhine, and in the following year, he was entrusted with chief control of all the Austrian forces on that river. His conduct of the operations against [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]] and [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]] in 1796 marked him out at once as one of the greatest generals in Europe. At first falling back carefully and avoiding a decision, he finally marched away, leaving a mere screen in front of Moreau. Falling upon Jourdan, he beat him in the battles of [[Battle of Amberg|Amberg]] (August) and [[Battle of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]] (September), and drove him over the Rhine with great loss. He then turned upon Moreau's army, which he defeated and forced out of Germany ([[Battle of Emmendingen]], October).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=935}}\n\n==Napoleonic Wars==\n[[File:Johann Peter Krafft 003.jpg|thumb|300px|Victorious Archduke Charles of Austria during the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] (21\u201322 May 1809).]]\n{{See also|Imperial and Royal Army during the Napoleonic Wars}}\n\nIn 1797 he was sent to arrest the victorious march of [[Napoleon|General Bonaparte]] in Italy, and he conducted the retreat of the over-matched Austrians with the highest skill. In the campaign of 1799 he once more opposed [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]], whom he defeated in the battles of [[Battle of Ostrach|Ostrach]] and [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach]], following up his success by invading [[Helvetic Republic|Switzerland]] and defeating [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na|Mass\u00e9na]] in the [[First Battle of Zurich]], after which he re-entered Germany and drove the French once more over the Rhine.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=935}}<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Gunther E.

The result of the [[Battle of Hohenlinden]] had, however, foredoomed the attempt, and the archduke had to make the armistice of [[Steyr]]. His popularity was now such that the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg]], which met in 1802, resolved to erect a statue in his honor and to give him the title of savior of his country, but Charles refused both distinctions.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=935}}\n\nIn the short and disastrous war of 1805 Archduke Charles commanded what was intended to be the main army in Italy, but events made Germany the decisive theatre of operations; Austria sustained defeat on the [[Danube]], and the archduke was defeated by Massena in the [[Battle of Caldiero (1805)|Battle of Caldiero]]. With the conclusion of peace he began his active work of army reorganization, which was first tested on the field in 1809.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=935}}\n\nIn 1806 Francis II (now Francis I of Austria) named the Archduke Charles, already a [[Field Marshal (Germany)|field marshal]], as Commander in Chief of the Austrian army and Head of the [[Council of War (Austria)|Council of War]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Supported by the prestige of being the only general who had proved capable of defeating the French, he promptly initiated a far-reaching scheme of reform, which replaced the obsolete methods of the 18th century. The chief characteristics of the new order were the adoption of the nation in arms principle and the adoption of French war organization and tactics. The army reforms were not yet completed by the war of 1809, in which Charles acted as commander in chief, yet even so it proved a far more formidable opponent than the old and was only defeated after a desperate struggle involving Austrian victories and large loss of life on both sides.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=935}}\n\nIts initial successes were neutralized by the reverses of [[Battle of Abensberg|Abensberg]], [[Battle of Landshut (1809)|Landshut]] and [[Battle of Eckm\u00fchl|Eckm\u00fchl]] but, after the evacuation of Vienna, the archduke won a strong victory at the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] but soon afterwards lost at the [[Battle of Wagram]]. At the end of the campaign the archduke gave up all his military offices.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=935}}\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Karl AustriaTeschen Henriette NassauWeilburg.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Archduke Charles with family.]]\n\nWhen Austria joined the ranks of the allies during the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], Charles was not given a command and the post of commander-in-chief of the allied Grand Army of Bohemia went to the [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Prince of Schwarzenberg]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Charles spent the rest of his life in retirement, except for a short time in 1815 when he was military governor of the [[Fortress Mainz]]. In 1822 he succeeded to the duchy of Saxe-Teschen.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=935}}\n\nOn 15 September/17 September 1815 in [[Weilburg]], Charles married Princess [[Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg]] (1797\u20131829). She was a daughter of [[Frederick William of Nassau-Weilburg]] (1768\u20131816) and his wife [[Burgravine Louise Isabelle of Kirchberg]].\n\nFrederick William was the eldest surviving son of [[Karl Christian of Nassau-Weilburg]] and [[Princess Wilhelmine Carolina of Orange-Nassau]].\n\nWilhelmine Carolina was a daughter of [[William IV, Prince of Orange]] and [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange]]. Anne was in turn the eldest daughter of [[George II of Great Britain]] and [[Caroline of Ansbach]].\n\nCharles died at [[Vienna]] on 30 April 1847. He is buried in tomb 122 in the [[Imperial Crypt Vaults#The New Vault|New Vault]] of the [[Imperial Crypt]] in Vienna.<ref>[http://www.napoleon-empire.com/personalities/archiduc_charles.php Archduke Charles' short biography] in Napoleon & Empire website, displaying a photograph of his tomb in Vienna</ref> An equestrian statue was erected to his memory on the [[Heldenplatz]] in Vienna in 1860.\n\n==Assessment of his achievements==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{POV section|date=February 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\n}}\nThe caution which the [[archduke]] preached so earnestly in his strategic works, he displayed in practice only when the situation seemed to demand it, though his education certainly prejudiced him in favor of the defensive at all costs. He was at the same time capable of forming and executing the most daring offensive strategy, and his tactical skill in the handling of troops, whether in wide turning movements, as at W\u00fcrzburg and Z\u00fcrich, or in masses, as at Aspern and Wagram, was certainly equal to that of any leader of his time, with only a few exceptions.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=935}}\n\n[[File:Archduke Charles at Battle of Ostrach.JPG|left|thumb|230px|Archduke Charles at the Battle of Ostrach]]\nAccording to the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], his [[military campaign|campaign]] of 1796 is considered almost faultless. That he sustained defeat in 1809 was due in part to the great numerical superiority of the French and their allies, and in part to the condition of his newly reorganized troops. His six weeks' inaction after the victory of Aspern is, however, open to unfavorable criticism. As a military writer, his position in the evolution of the art of war is very important, and his doctrines had naturally the greatest weight. Nevertheless, they cannot but be considered antiquated even in 1806. Caution and the importance of strategic points are the chief features of his system. The rigidity of his geographical strategy may be gathered from the prescription that \"this principle is never to be departed from.\"{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=935}}\n\nAgain and again he repeated the advice that nothing should be hazarded unless one's army is completely secure, a rule which he himself neglected with such brilliant results in 1796. Strategic points, he says, not the defeat of the enemy's army, decide the fate of one's own country, and must constantly remain the general's main concern, a [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] which was never more remarkably disproved than in the war of 1809. The editor of the archduke's work is able to make but a feeble defense against [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]]'s reproach that Charles attached more value to ground than to the annihilation of the foe. In his tactical writings the same spirit is conspicuous. His reserve in battle is designed to \"cover a retreat.\"{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=935-936}}\n\n[[File:Archduke Charles Statue.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Statue of Archduke Charles on the [[Heldenplatz]] in Vienna]]\n\nThe baneful influence of these antiquated principles was clearly shown in the maintenance of [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz|K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz-Josefstadt]] in 1866 as a strategic point, which was preferred to the defeat of the separated Prussian armies, and in the strange plans produced in Vienna for the campaign of 1859, and in the almost unintelligible [[Battle of Montebello (1859)|Battle of Montebello]] in the same year. The theory and the practice of Archduke Charles form one of the most curious contrasts in military history. In the one he is unreal, in the other he displayed, along with the greatest skill, a vivid activity which made him for long the most formidable opponent of Napoleon.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=936}}\n\nHe was the 831st [[Knight]] of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in [[Austrian Empire|Austria]].\n\n===Creation of the Austrian Staff===\n\nWhen [[Karl Mack von Leiberich]] became chief of staff of the army under [[Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] in the Netherlands, he issued the ''Instruktionspunkte fur die gesamte Herren Generals'', the last of 19 points setting out the roles of staff officers, dealing with offensive and defensive operations, while helping the Commander-in-chief. In 1796, Archduke Charles augmented these with his own ''Observationspunkte'', writing of the Chief of Staff: \u201che is duty bound to consider all possibilities related to operations and not view himself as merely carrying out those instructions\u201d.<ref>Osterreichische Milit\u00e4rische Zeitschrift (Streffleur, Vienna) 1860 III, 229-233</ref>  On 20 March 1801, Feldmarschalleutnant Duka became the world's first peacetime ''Generalquartiermeister'' at the head of the staff and the wartime role of the Chief of Staff was now focused on planning and operations to assist the Commander. Archduke Charles produced a new Dienstvorschrift on 1 September 1805,<ref>Regele, O.: Generalstabschefs aus vier Jahrhunderten  (Vienna) 1966,  p.55</ref> which divided the staff into three: 1) Political Correspondence; 2) the Operations Directorate, dealing with planning and intelligence; 3) the Service Directorate, dealing with administration, supply and military justice. The Archduke set out the position of a modern Chief of Staff: \u201cThe Chief of Staff stands at the side of the Commander-in-Chief and is completely at his disposal. His sphere of work connects him with no specific unit\u201d. \u201cThe Commander-in-Chief decides what should happen and how; his chief assistant works out these decisions, so that each subordinate understands his allotted task\u201d. With the creation of the Korps in 1809, each had a staff, whose chief was responsible for directing operations and executing the overall headquarters plan.\n\n==Issue==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"250\" | Name\n! width=\"125\" | Birth\n! width=\"125\" | Death\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n| [[Maria Theresa of Austria (1816-1867)|Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria]] || 31 July 1816 || 8 August 1867|| Married [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies]], had issue.\n|-\n| [[Archduke Albert, Duke of Teschen]] || 3 August 1817 || 2 February 1895 || Married [[Princess Hildegard of Bavaria]], had issue.\n|-\n| [[Karl Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Karl Ferdinand]] || 29 July 1818 || 20 November 1874 || Married [[Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria]], had issue.\n|-\n| [[Archduke Frederick Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Frederick Ferdinand]] || 14 May 1821 || 5 October 1847 || Died unmarried.\n|-\n| Archduke Rudolph of Austria || 25 September 1822 || 11 October 1822 || Died in childhood.\n|-\n|[[Archduchess Maria Karoline of Austria (1825-1915)|Archduchess Maria Karoline of Austria]] || 10 September 1825 || 17 July 1915 || Married her first cousin [[Archduke Rainer Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Rainer of Austria]], third son of [[Archduke Rainer Joseph of Austria|Archduke Rainer of Austria]] and Princess Elisabeth of Savoy-Carignano.\n|-\n| [[Archduke Wilhelm Franz of Austria (1827-1894)|Archduke Wilhelm of Austria]] || 21 April 1827 || 29 July 1894 || Died unmarried.\n|}\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center |ref=<ref>{{cite book|title=Genealogie ascendante jusqu'au quatrieme degre inclusivement de tous les Rois et Princes de maisons souveraines de l'Europe actuellement vivans| trans-title=Genealogy up to the fourth degree inclusive of all the Kings and Princes of sovereign houses of Europe currently living |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AINPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA109|year=1768|publisher=Frederic Guillaume Birnstiel|location=Bourdeaux|language=fr|page=109}}</ref>\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

He is considered the \"Apostle to the English\" and a founder of the [[Catholic Church in England]], and by consequence traced as the founder of the [[Church of England]].<ref name=DictSaint>Delaney ''Dictionary of Saints'' pp. 67\u201368</ref>\n\nAugustine was the [[prior]] of a monastery in [[Rome]] when Pope [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] chose him in 595 to lead a mission, usually known as the [[Gregorian mission]], to Britain to [[Christianization|Christianize]] King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent|\u00c6thelberht]] and his [[Kingdom of Kent]] from [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]]. Kent was probably chosen because \u00c6thelberht had married a Christian princess, [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], daughter of [[Charibert I]] the [[List of Frankish kings|King of Paris]], who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. Before reaching Kent, the missionaries had considered turning back, but Gregory urged them on, and in 597, Augustine landed on the [[Isle of Thanet]] and proceeded to \u00c6thelberht's main town of [[Canterbury]].\n\nKing \u00c6thelberht converted to Christianity and allowed the missionaries to preach freely, giving them land to found a monastery outside the city walls. Augustine was consecrated as a [[bishop]] and converted many of the king's subjects, including thousands during a mass baptism on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] in 597. Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601, along with encouraging letters and gifts for the churches, although attempts to persuade the native British bishops to submit to Augustine's authority failed. Roman bishops were established at [[London]], and [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in 604, and a school was founded to train [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] priests and missionaries. Augustine also arranged the [[consecration]] of his successor, [[Laurence of Canterbury]]. The archbishop probably died in 604 and was soon revered as a [[saint]].\n\n== Background to the mission ==\nAfter the withdrawal of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman legion|legions]] from their province of [[Britannia]] in 410, the inhabitants were left to defend themselves against the attacks of the [[Saxons]]. Before the Roman withdrawal, Britannia had been converted to Christianity and produced the [[ascetic]] [[Pelagius]].<ref name=Hindley3/><ref name=Mayr78/> Britain sent three bishops to the [[Synod of Arles (314)|Council of Arles]] in 314, and a [[Roman Gaul|Gaulish]] bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters.<ref name=Frend80>Frend \"Roman Britain\" ''Cross Goes North'' pp. 80\u201381</ref> Material remains testify to a growing presence of Christians, at least until around 360.<ref name=Frend82>Frend \"Roman Britain\" ''Cross Goes North'' pp. 82\u201386</ref> After the Roman legions departed, pagan tribes settled the southern parts of the island while western Britain, beyond the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, remained Christian. This native [[Celtic Christianity|British Church]] developed in isolation from Rome under the influence of missionaries from Ireland<ref name=Hindley3>Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 3\u20139</ref><ref name=Mayr78/> and was centred on monasteries instead of bishoprics. Other distinguishing characteristics were its calculation of the date of [[Easter]] and the style of the [[tonsure]] haircut that clerics wore.<ref name=Mayr78>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 78\u201393</ref><ref name=Yorke115>Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' pp. 115\u2013118 discusses the issue of the \"Celtic Church\" and what exactly it was.</ref> Evidence for the survival of Christianity in the eastern part of Britain during this time includes the survival of the cult of [[Saint Alban]] and the occurrence in place names of ''eccles'', derived from the Latin ''ecclesia'', meaning \"church\".<ref name=Yorke121>Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 121</ref> There is no evidence that these native Christians tried to convert the Anglo-Saxons.<ref name=ASE102>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 102</ref><ref name=Harting32>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 32\u201333</ref> The invasions destroyed most remnants of Roman civilisation in the areas held by the Saxons and related tribes, including the economic and religious structures.<ref name=Kirby23>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 23</ref>\n\nIt was against this background that Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission, often called the Gregorian mission, to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity in 595.<ref name=ASE104>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 104\u2013105</ref><ref name=Jones>Jones \"Gregorian Mission\" ''Speculum''</ref> The Kingdom of Kent was ruled by \u00c6thelberht, who married a Christian princess named Bertha before 588,<ref name=ASE105>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 105\u2013106</ref> and perhaps earlier than 560.<ref name=Kirby24>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' pp. 24\u201325</ref> Bertha was the daughter of Charibert I, one of the [[Merovingian]] kings of the [[Franks]]. As one of the conditions of her marriage, she brought a bishop named [[Liudhard]] with her to Kent.<ref name=DNBBertha>Nelson \"Bertha\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> Together in Canterbury, they restored a church that dated to Roman times<ref name=Hindley33>Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 33\u201336</ref>\u2014possibly the current [[St Martin's Church, Canterbury|St Martin's Church]]. \u00c6thelberht was a pagan at this point but allowed his wife freedom of worship. One biographer of Bertha states that under his wife's influence, \u00c6thelberht asked Pope Gregory to send missionaries.<ref name=DNBBertha/> The historian [[Ian N. Wood]] feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen.<ref name=Wood10>Wood \"Mission of Augustine of Canterbury\" ''Speculum'' pp. 9\u201310</ref> Other historians, however, believe that Gregory initiated the mission, although the exact reasons remain unclear. [[Bede]], an 8th-century monk who wrote a history of the English church, recorded a famous story in which Gregory saw fair-haired Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people.{{efn|Supposedly Gregory inquired about who the slaves were. He was told they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels.<ref>Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 99\u2013100</ref>}}<ref name=Harting57>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 57\u201359</ref> More practical matters, such as the acquisition of new provinces acknowledging the primacy of the papacy, and a desire to influence the emerging power of the Kentish kingdom under \u00c6thelberht, were probably involved.<ref name=Hindley33/> The mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the [[Lombards]] who, as pagans and [[Arian]] Christians, were not on good relations with the Catholic church in Rome.<ref name=DNB>Mayr-Harting \"Augustine\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>\n\nAside from \u00c6thelberht's granting of freedom of worship to his wife, the choice of Kent was probably dictated by a number of other factors. Kent was the dominant power in southeastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King [[Ceawlin of Wessex]] in 592, \u00c6thelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to \u00c6thelberht as having [[imperium]] (overlordship) south of the [[Humber|River Humber]]. Trade between the Franks and \u00c6thelberht's kingdom was well established, and the [[language barrier]] between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area.<ref name=Brooks7>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 6\u20137</ref> There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Bertha's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence was not merely political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well.<ref name=Kirby27>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 27</ref>\n\nIn 595, Gregory chose Augustine, who was the prior of the [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio|Abbey of St Andrew's]] in Rome, to head the mission to Kent.<ref name=ASE104/> The pope selected monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish royalty and clergy in a series of letters, of which some copies survive in Rome. He wrote to King [[Theuderic II]] of [[Burgundy]] and to King [[Theudebert II]] of [[Austrasia]], as well as their grandmother [[Brunhilda of Austrasia|Brunhild]], seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King [[Chlothar II]] of [[Neustria]] for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and Frankish priests to accompany the mission.<ref name=Brooks4>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 4\u20135</ref> By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to assure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as \u00c6thelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission which visibly had the support of his wife's relatives and people.<ref name=Brooks6>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 6</ref> Moreover, the Franks appreciated the chance to participate in mission that would extend their influence in Kent. Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.<ref name=Wood9>Wood \"Mission of Augustine of Canterbury\" ''Speculum'' p. 9</ref>\n\nSources make no mention of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission. Pope Gregory once wrote to \u00c6thelberht complimenting Augustine's knowledge of the [[Bible]], so Augustine was evidently well educated. Other qualifications included administrative ability, for Gregory was the abbot of St Andrews as well as being pope, which left the day-to-day running of the abbey to Augustine, the prior.<ref name=Fletcher116>Fletcher ''Barbarian Conversion'' pp. 116\u2013117</ref>\n\n== Arrival and first efforts ==\n[[File:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|330px|left|thumb|Map of the general outlines of some of the British kingdoms about 600|alt=Map showing the kingdoms of Dyfed, Powys, and Gwynedd in the west central part of the island of Great Britain.

They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return. Gregory refused and sent Augustine back with letters encouraging the missionaries to persevere.<ref name=Blair116>Blair ''Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 116\u2013117</ref> In 597, Augustine and his companions landed in Kent.<ref name=ASE105/> They achieved some initial success soon after their arrival:<ref name=DNB/><ref name=\"Fletcher116\" /> \u00c6thelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury where they used the church of St Martin's for services.<ref name=Brooks8/> Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of \u00c6thelberht's conversion,<ref name=Woods11>Wood \"Mission of Augustine of Canterbury\" ''Speculum'' p. 11</ref> but it probably took place in 597.<ref name=Brooks8/>{{efn|However, Bede's chronology may be a bit off, as he gives the king's death as occurring in February 616, and says the king died 21 years after his conversion, which would date the conversion to 595. This would be before Augustine's mission, and directly contradicts Bede's statement that the king's conversion was due to Augustine's mission.<ref name=\"Kirby24\" /> However, as Gregory in his letter of 601 to the king and queen strongly implies that the queen was unable to effect the conversion of her husband, the problem of the dating is likely a chronological error on Bede's part.<ref name=Kirby28/>}} In the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] period, large-scale conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and Augustine is recorded as making large numbers of converts within a year of his arrival in Kent.<ref name=Brooks8/> Also, by 601, Gregory was writing to both \u00c6thelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism.{{efn|The letter, as translated in Brooks' ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'', p. 8, says \"preserve the grace he had received\". ''Grace'' in this context meant the grace of baptism.}} A [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler [[Thomas Elmham]], gives the date of the king's conversion as [[Pentecost|Whit Sunday]], or 2 June 597; there is no reason to doubt this date, although there is no other evidence for it.<ref name=Brooks8>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 8\u20139</ref> Against a date in 597 is a letter of Gregory's to Patriarch [[Eulogius of Alexandria]] in June 598, which mentions the number of converts made by Augustine, but does not mention any baptism of the king. However, it is clear that by 601 the king had been converted.<ref name=Kirby28>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 28</ref> His baptism likely took place at Canterbury.<ref name=Convert56>Higham ''Convert Kings'' p. 56</ref>\n\nAugustine established his [[episcopal see]] at Canterbury.<ref name=DNB/> It is not clear when and where Augustine was consecrated as a bishop. Bede, writing about a century later, states that Augustine was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop \u00c6therius of [[Arles]], Gaul (France) after the conversion of \u00c6thelberht. Contemporary letters from Pope Gregory, however, refer to Augustine as a bishop before he arrived in England. A letter of Gregory's from September 597 calls Augustine a bishop, and one dated ten months later says Augustine had been consecrated on Gregory's command by bishops of the German lands.<ref name=Brooks5>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 5</ref> The historian R. A. Markus discusses the various theories of when and where Augustine was consecrated, and suggests he was consecrated before arriving in England, but argues the evidence does not permit deciding exactly where this took place.<ref name=Markus24>Markus \"Chronology of the Gregorian Mission\" ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' pp. 24\u201329</ref>\n\nSoon after his arrival, Augustine founded the [[monastery]] of Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], which later became [[St Augustine's Abbey]],<ref name=DNB/> on land donated by the king.<ref name=Blair61>Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' pp. 61\u201362</ref> This foundation has often been claimed as the first Benedictine abbey outside Italy, and that by founding it, Augustine introduced the [[Rule of St. Benedict]] into England, but there is no evidence the abbey followed the Benedictine Rule at the time of its foundation.<ref name=Monasticism55>Lawrence ''Medieval Monasticism'' p. 55</ref> In a letter Gregory wrote to the [[patriarch of Alexandria]] in 598, he claimed that more than 10,000 Christians had been baptised; the number may be exaggerated but there is no reason to doubt that a mass conversion took place.<ref name=ASE105/><ref name=Fletcher116/> However, there were probably some Christians already in Kent before Augustine arrived, remnants of the Christians who lived in Britain in the later Roman Empire.<ref name=\"Harting32\" /> Little literary traces remain of them, however.<ref name=Frend79>Frend \"Roman Britain\" ''Cross Goes North'' p. 79</ref> One other effect of the king's conversion by Augustine's mission was that the Frankish influence on the southern kingdoms of Britain was decreased.<ref name=Kirby29>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 29</ref>\n\nAfter these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with a report of his success, along with questions about the mission.<ref name=ASE106>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 106</ref> Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]''; this section of the ''History'' is usually known as the ''[[Libellus responsionum]]''.<ref name=Laurentius>Lapidge \"Laurentius\" ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref><ref name=Bede71/> Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.<ref name=Bede71>Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 71\u201383</ref>\n\nFurther missionaries were sent from Rome in 601. They brought a [[pallium]] for Augustine and a present of sacred vessels, [[vestment]]s, [[relic]]s, and books.{{efn|What happened to these items in later years is unknown. [[Thomas Elmham]], a 15th-century chronicler at Canterbury, gave a number of theories of how most of these objects were lost, including being hidden and never recovered during the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Danish attacks]] in the 9th and 10th centuries, hidden and lost after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066, or used for the ransom of King [[Richard I of England]] in the 1190s.<ref name=Dodwell10>Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' p. 10</ref> The surviving [[St Augustine Gospels]], ([[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] manuscript (MS) 286) which is a 6th-century Italian-illuminated [[Gospel Book]], may be one of the works sent to Augustine. Traditionally, it has been associated with the [[Gregorian mission]].<ref name=Dodwell96>Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' pp. 96 and 276 footnote 66</ref> Another possible survivor is a copy of the ''[[Rule of St Benedict]]'', now MS Oxford [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] Hatton 48.<ref name=Colgrave27>Colgrave \"Introduction\" ''Earliest Life of Gregory the Great'' pp. 27\u201328</ref> Yet another possible survival is a Gospel, in an Italian hand, and closely related to the Augustine Gospels, now MS Oxford Bodelian Auctarium D.2.14, which shows evidence of being held in Anglo-Saxon hands during the right time frame. Lastly, a fragment of a work by Gregory the Great, now held by the [[British Library]] as part of MS [[Cotton library|Cotton]] Titus C may have arrived with the missionaries.<ref name=Library24>Lapidge ''Anglo-Saxon Library'' pp. 24\u201325</ref>}} The pallium was the symbol of [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] status, and signified that Augustine was now an archbishop unambiguously associated with the Holy See. Along with the pallium, a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to consecrate 12 [[suffragan bishop]]s as soon as possible and to send a bishop to [[York]]. Gregory's plan was that there would be two metropolitans, one at York and one at London, with 12 suffragan bishops under each archbishop. As part of this plan, Augustine was expected to transfer his archiepiscopal see to London from Canterbury. The move from Canterbury to London never happened; no contemporary sources give the reason,<ref name=Brooks9>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 9\u201311</ref> but it was probably because London was not part of \u00c6thelberht's domains. Instead, London was part of the [[kingdom of Essex]], ruled by \u00c6thelberht's nephew [[Saebert of Essex]], who converted to Christianity in 604.<ref name=Hindley33/><ref name=Fletcher453>Fletcher ''Barbarian Conversion'' p. 453</ref> The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see was indeed moved to London, and that it was only with the abandonment of London as a see after the death of \u00c6thelberht that Canterbury became the archiepiscopal see.

Archaeological evidence seems to support the latter interpretation; in 1973 the remains of an aisled building dating from the [[Romano-British]] period were uncovered just south of the present [[Canterbury Cathedral]].<ref name=Brooks50>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 50</ref> The historian Ian Wood argues that the existence of the ''Libellus'' points to more contact between Augustine and the native Christians because the topics covered in the work are not restricted to conversion from paganism, but also dealt with relations between differing styles of Christianity.<ref name=Wood170>Wood \"Augustine and Aidan\" ''L'\u00c9glise et la Mission'' p. 170</ref>\n\nAugustine failed to extend his authority to the Christians in Wales and [[Dumnonia]] to the west. Gregory had decreed that these Christians should submit to Augustine and that their bishops should obey him,<ref name=Harting70>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 70\u201372</ref> apparently believing that more of the Roman governmental and ecclesiastical organisation survived in Britain than was actually the case.<ref name=Conversion118>Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 118</ref> According to the narrative of Bede, the Britons in these regions viewed Augustine with uncertainty, and their suspicion was compounded by a diplomatic misjudgement on Augustine's part.<ref name=ASE110>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 110\u2013111</ref> In 603, Augustine and \u00c6thelberht summoned the British bishops to a meeting south of the Severn. These guests retired early to confer with their people,<ref name=Hindley8/> who, according to Bede, advised them to judge Augustine based upon the respect he displayed at their next meeting. When Augustine failed to rise from his seat on the entrance of the British bishops,<ref name=Bede100>Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 100\u2013103</ref> they refused to recognise him as their archbishop.<ref name=Hindley8>Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 8\u20139</ref><ref name=Harting72/> There were, however, deep differences between Augustine and the British church that perhaps played a more significant role in preventing an agreement. At issue were the tonsure, the observance of Easter, and practical and deep-rooted differences in approach to asceticism, missionary endeavours, and how the church itself was organised.<ref name=ASE110/> Some historians believe that Augustine had no real understanding of the history and traditions of the British church, damaging his relations with their bishops.<ref name=Harting72>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 72\u201373</ref> Also, there were political dimensions involved, as Augustine's efforts were sponsored by the Kentish king, and at this period the Wessex and Mercian kingdoms were expanding to the west, into areas held by the Britons.<ref name=Conversion119>Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 119</ref>\n\n== Further success ==\nGregory also instructed Augustine on other matters. Temples were to be consecrated for Christian use,<ref name=Thomson8>Thomson ''Western Church'' p. 8</ref> and feasts, if possible, moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers were unaware of details of the martyr's life or death. They may have been native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman [[Pope Sixtus II|St Sixtus]].<ref name=Blair24>Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' p. 24</ref>\n\nGregory legislated on the behaviour of the laity and the clergy. He placed the new mission directly under papal authority and made it clear that English bishops would have no authority over Frankish counterparts nor vice versa. Other directives dealt with the training of native clergy and the missionaries' conduct.<ref name=ASE107>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 107\u2013108</ref>\n\n[[The King's School, Canterbury]] claims Augustine as its founder, which would make it the world's oldest existing school, but the first documentary records of the school date from the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kings-school.co.uk/document_1.aspx?id=1:31887&id=1:31658&id=1:31637 |title=597 and all that: A Brief History of the King's School, Canterbury |accessdate=31 March 2008 |publisher=The King's School, Canterbury |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928010901/http://www.kings-school.co.uk/document_1.aspx?id=1%3A31887&id=1%3A31658&id=1%3A31637 |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}</ref> Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the [[East Anglia]]n mission.<ref name=Brooks94>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 94\u201395</ref> Augustine received [[liturgical book]]s from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown.

Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales, no efforts had been made to try to convert the Saxon invaders. Augustine was sent to convert the descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the decisive influence in Christianity in the British Isles.<ref name=ASE110/><ref name=Collins185>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 185</ref> Much of his success came about because of Augustine's close relationship with \u00c6thelberht, which gave the archbishop time to establish himself.<ref name=Harting249>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' p. 249</ref> Augustine's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.<ref name=Harting264>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 265\u2013266</ref><ref name=Wood8>Wood \"Mission of Augustine of Canterbury\" ''Speculum'' p. 8</ref>\n\nAugustine's body was originally buried in the portico of what is now St Augustine's, Canterbury,<ref name=\"Blair61\" /> but it was later exhumed and placed in a tomb within the abbey church, which became a place of pilgrimage and veneration. After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] the cult of St Augustine was actively promoted.<ref name=DNB/> After the Conquest, his [[shrine]] in St Augustine's Abbey held a central position in one of the axial chapels, flanked by the shrines of his successors Laurence and Mellitus.<ref name=Nilson67>Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 67</ref> King [[Henry I of England]] granted St. Augustine's Abbey a six-day [[fair]] around the date on which Augustine's relics were [[Translation (relics)|translated]] to his new shrine, from 8 September through 13 September.<ref name=Shrines>Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 93</ref>\n\nA life of Augustine was written by [[Goscelin]] around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a different light than Bede's account.

He came from a rather wealthy country family. He studied at the University of Paris and became a master of arts sometime before 1210.<ref>Cullen,p.105</ref> He began to read theology in 1212 or 1213, and became a regent master in 1220 or 1221. He introduced the [[Sentences]] of Peter Lombard as the basic textbook for the study of theology. During the University strike of 1229, Alexander participated in an embassy to Rome to discuss the place of Aristotle in the curriculum. Having held a prebend at Holborn (prior to 1229) and a canonry of St. Paul's in London (1226-1229), he visited England in 1230 and received a canonry and an archdeaconry in Coventry and Lichfield, his native diocese. He taught at Paris in the academic year 1232-33, but was appointed to a delegation by Henry III of England in 1235, along with Simon Langton and Fulk Basset, to negotiate for the renewal of the peace between England and France.\n\nIn 1236 or 1237, aged about 50, Alexander made the surprising step of entering the [[Franciscan]] Order, thus becoming the first Franciscan friar to hold a University chair. His doctrinal positions became the starting point for the Franciscan school of theology. He continued to teach and to represent the University, and participated in the [[First Council of Lyon]] in the winter of 1245.\n\nAfter returning to Paris, Alexander fell ill, probably due to an epidemic then sweeping the city. Shortly before his death, he passed his chair on to [[John of La Rochelle]], setting the precedent for that chair to be held by a Franciscan.<ref>Principe p.14</ref> Alexander died at Paris on 21 August 1245.\n\nAs the first [[Franciscan]] to hold a chair at the [[University of Paris]], Alexander had many significant disciples. He was called ''Doctor Irrefragibilis'' (Irrefutable Teacher) and ''Doctor Doctorum'' (Teacher of Teachers).<ref>Brown and Flores, p.10</ref> The latter title is especially suggestive of his role in forming several Franciscans who later became influential thinkers in the faculty, among them [[Saint Bonaventure]], John of La Rochelle, Odo Rigaldus, William of Middleton and [[Richard Rufus of Cornwall]].<ref>Brown and Flores, p.10</ref> Bonaventure, who may not have sat under Alexander directly, nevertheless referred to Alexander as his \"father and master\" and wished to \"follow in his footsteps.\"<ref>Cullen,p.105</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[Image:Alexander - Summa universae theologiae - 4316508.tif|thumb|''Summa universae theologiae'']]\n{{Catholic philosophy}}\nAlexander is known for reflecting the works of several other Middle Age thinkers, especially those of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]] and [[Saint Augustine]]. He was also known to quote thinkers such as [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]] and [[Richard of Saint-Victor]]. He differs from those in his genre as he is known to reflect his own interests and those of his generation.<ref>Studies in Scholoasticism</ref> When using the works of his authorities, Alexander does not only review their reasoning but also gives conclusions, expands on them, and offers his agreements and disagreement with them.<ref>Studies in Scholasticism</ref> He was also different in that he appeals to Pre-Lombardian figures, and in his use of [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], whose works were not cited as frequently by other 12th-century scholastics.<ref>Studies in Scholasticism</ref> Aristotle is also quite frequently quoted in Alexander's works. Alexander was fascinated by the Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchy of angels and in how their nature can be understood, given Aristotelian [[metaphysics]].<ref>Studies in Scholasticism</ref>\n\nAmong the doctrines which were specially developed and, so to speak, fixed by Alexander of Hales, are the ''thesaurus supererogationis perfectorum'' (treasury of supererogatory merits) and the ''[[character indelibilis]]'' (sacramental character) of [[baptism]], [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]], and [[Holy Orders|ordination]]. That doctrine had been written about much earlier by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and was eventually defined a [[dogma]] by the [[Council of Trent]]. He also posed an important question about the cause of the [[Incarnation]]: would Christ have been incarnated if humanity had never sinned? The question eventually became the focal point for a philosophical issue (the theory of possible worlds) and a theological topic on the distinction between God's absolute power (''potentia absoluta'') and His ordained power (''potentia ordinata'').\n\n===Summa Universae Theologiae===\nHe had written the summary/commentary of Peter Lombard's four books of the ''Sentences''. It had exposed the trinitarian theology of the Greeks.<ref>Backus,p.301</ref> This had been the most important writing that Alexander had claimed, and it had been the earliest in the genre. While it is common for scholars to state that Alexander was the first to write a commentary on the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]], it is not quite accurate. Authorship is more contentious for this work; although he started this work, he died before it could be finished, and it most likely was more a product of people other than Alexander.<ref>Beiting p.5</ref> There were a number of \"commentaries\" on the ''Sentences'', but Alexander's appears to have been the first magisterial commentary. Although it was Alexander's most significant writing, it had not been completed, therefore leaving historians with many questions on the reliability and quality of the writing. This was taken into consideration when the ''Summa'' had been examined by Father Victorin Doucet for different editions of them. The sources has seem to be the resulting problem of the ''Summa'', \"counted there were 4814 explicit quotations and 1372 implicit quotations from [[Augustine]], more than one quarter of texts were cited in the body of the ''Summa''.<ref>\"Backus,p.&nbsp;303</ref>{{Incomprehensible inline|date=March 2016}}\n\nOf Alexander's ''Summa'', which was on one occasion proclaimed by an assembly of seventy doctors to be infallible, [[Roger Bacon]] declared that, though it was as heavy as the weight of a horse, it was full of errors and displayed ignorance of physics, of metaphysics, and even of logic.<ref>[[Francis Seymour Stevenson]], ''Robert Grosseteste: Bishop of Lincoln'' (1899) citing Roger Bacon's ''Opus Minus'' ed. Brewer pp. 325-327 & ''Opus Tertium'' p. 30</ref>\n\n===Other historical works===\nAlexander also influenced and sometimes is confused with [[Alexander Carpenter]], Latinized as ''Fabricius'' (fl. 1429), who was the author of the ''Destructorium viciorum'', a religious work popular in the 15th and 16th centuries.<ref>Gerald Robert Owst: ''The Destructorium viciorum of Alexander Carpenter'', Church Historical Society, [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], London, 1952, 40 pp.</ref> Carpenter also authored other works, such as \"''Homiliae eruditae''\" (\"Learned Sermons\").<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Carpenter, Alexander |volume=9|page=153}}</ref><ref>George Watson (ed.): ''The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, Volume 1, 600-1660''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974, p. 803.</ref>\n\n==Historiographical contribution==\nAlexander was said to have been among the earliest scholastics to engage with Aristotle's newly translated writings.<ref>Cullen,p.104</ref> Between 1220 and 1227, he wrote ''Glossa in quatuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi'' (''A Gloss on the [[Sentences|Four Books of the Sentences]] of [[Peter Lombard]]'') (composed in the mid-12th century), which was particularly important because it was the first time that a book other than the Bible was used as a basic text for theological study.<ref>Brown and Flores,p.10</ref> This steered the development of scholasticism in a more systematic direction,<ref>Brown and Flores, p.10</ref> inaugurating an important tradition of writing commentaries on the ''Sentences'' as a fundamental step in the training of master theologians.\n\n===A medieval scholastic===\nIn doing so, he elevated Lombard's work from a mere theological resource to the basic framework of questions and problems from which masters could teach. The commentary (or more correctly titled a ''Gloss'') survived in student reports from Alexander's teaching in the classroom and so it provides a major insight into the way theologians taught their discipline in the 1220s. As is the case with ''Glossa'' and ''Quaestiones Disputatae'', much of his work is probably written in the form of notes on his oral teachings by students, though the content is definitely his.<ref>Principe 20</ref>\n\nFor his contemporaries, however, Alexander's fame was his inexhaustible interest in disputation.  His disputations prior to his becoming a Franciscan cover over 1,600 pages in their modern edition.  His disputed questions after 1236 remain unpublished.  Alexander was also one of the first scholastics to participate in the ''Quodlibetal'', a university event in which a master had to respond to any question posed by any student or master over a period of three days.  Alexander's ''Quodlibetal questions'' also remain unedited.\n\n===Theologian===\nAt the beginning of 1236, he entered the Franciscan order (he was at least 50) and was the first Franciscan to hold a chair at the University of Paris.<ref>Cullen, p.104</ref> He held this post until shortly before his death in Paris in 1245.<ref>Principe, p.14</ref> When he became a Franciscan and thus created a formal Franciscan school of theology at Paris, it was soon clear that his students lacked some of the basic tools for the discipline.  Alexander responded by beginning a ''Summa theologiae'' that is now known as the ''Summa fratris Alexandri''.  Alexander drew mainly from his own disputations, but also selected ideas, arguments and sources from his contemporaries.  It treats in its first part the doctrines of [[God]] and his attributes; in its second, those of [[creation myth|creation]] and [[sin]]; in its third, those of [[Salvation|redemption]] and [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]; and, in its fourth and last, those of the [[sacrament]]s. This massive text, which [[Roger Bacon]] would later sarcastically describe as weighing as much as a horse, was unfinished at his death; his students, William of Middleton and John of Rupella, were charged with its completion.  It was certainly read by the Franciscans at Paris, including [[Bonaventure]].\n\nAlexander was an innovative theologian. He was part of the generation that first grappled with the writings of [[Aristotle]].  While there was a ban on using Aristotle's works as teaching texts, theologians like Alexander continued to exploit his ideas in their theology.  Two other uncommon sources were promoted by Alexander: [[Anselm of Canterbury]], whose writings had been ignored for almost a century, gained an important advocate in Alexander and he used Anselm's works extensively in his teaching on [[Christology]] and [[soteriology]]; and, [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], whom Alexander used in his examination of the theology of Orders and ecclesiastical structures.\n\nThough he also continued the tradition of Aristotle- and Augustine-focused thought in the Franciscan school, he did so through an [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]-directed lens.<ref>Cullen 104</ref> In fact, Alexander was one of the major influences for the advancement of Anselmian thought in the 13th century.<ref>Cullen,p.104</ref> One such example is the idea of original sin as a lack of justice. Alexander believed that original sin is both a punishment as well as a cause for punishment.<ref>Beiting p.13</ref> That is to say, the body is corrupt, but the soul is clean. Alexander advances the idea that it would not be God's fault to create a being that would bind the \u2018corrupt\u2019 with the \u2018clean\u2019.<ref>Beiting p.7</ref> He advanced a highly original response that the soul naturally desires the body.<ref>Beiting p.8</ref> Consequently, God is both merciful in giving the soul what it wants, as well as just in punishing the soul for binding with the corrupt flesh. Either the soul knew that the body was corrupt, or it did not (in which case it would be \u201claboring under ignorance\u201d); both of these considerations are cause for divine punishment.<ref>Beiting p.8</ref>\n\nAlexander is also known for rejecting the idea that there are many things in God's mind, instead claiming that it is more perfect to know just one thing.<ref>Wood p.8</ref> He did not start off with this view, though. In the ''Glossa'', he openly suggests the idea of the multiplicity of divine ideas.<ref>Wood p.8</ref> In his later work, ''Quaestio disputata antequam erat Frater 46'', he finally rejects the plurality of divine ideas, and this theme continues through the rest of his works.<ref>Wood p.9</ref> Specifically, in one of his last works, ''De scientia divina'', he concludes that the idea of [[wikt:plurality|plurality]] itself is strictly temporal, a human notion.<ref>Wood p.13</ref>\n\nOne of his more famous works, the ''Summa'', is important because of its system for determining if a war is just.<ref>Russell p.602</ref> There are six requirements for determining this: authority and attitude (in reference to who declares the war), intention and condition (in reference to the soldiers), merit (of the enemy) and just cause.<ref>Russell p.602</ref> Just cause becomes the overarching moral principle for declaring war in three ways: the relief of good people, coercion of the wicked, and peace for all.<ref>Russell p.603</ref> It is important to note that Alexander put \u2018peace for all\u2019 at the end of the list to amplify its importance.<ref>Russell p.603</ref>\n\n==Writings==\n*Alexander of Hales.

The ASP interpreter reads and executes all script code between <% and %> tags, the result of which is content generation. These scripts were written using [[VBScript]], [[JScript]], or [[PerlScript]]. The <code>@Language</code> directive, the {{tag|script|s|params=language=\"manu\" runat=\"server\"}} syntax or server configuration can be used to select the language. In the example below, Response.Write Now() is in an [[HTML]] page; it would be dynamically replaced by the current time of the server.\n{|\n! Server side !!

Pages with the ''.aspx'' extension use compiled [[ASP.NET]]; however, ASP.NET pages may still include some ASP scripting.

It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better-absorbed, following oral administration, than other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. \nIn general, ''[[Streptococcus]], [[Bacillus subtilis]], [[Enterococcus]], [[Haemophilus]], [[Helicobacter]],'' and ''[[Moraxella]]'' are susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas ''[[Citrobacter]], [[Klebsiella]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' are resistant to it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amoxicillin spectrum of bacterial susceptibility and Resistance|url=http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Amoxicillin%20sodium%20salt.pdf |accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> Some ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and most clinical strains of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' have developed resistance to amoxicillin to varying degrees.\n\n==Adverse effects==\n[[Adverse drug reaction|Side effect]]s are similar to those for other [[\u03b2-lactam antibiotic]]s,  including [[nausea]], vomiting, rashes, and antibiotic-associated [[colitis]]. Loose bowel movements (diarrhea) may also occur. Rarer side effects include mental changes, lightheadedness, insomnia, confusion, anxiety, sensitivity to lights and sounds, and unclear thinking. Immediate medical care is required upon the first signs of these side effects.\n\nThe onset of an allergic reaction to amoxicillin can be very sudden and intense; emergency medical attention must be sought as quickly as possible. The initial phase of such a reaction often starts with a change in mental state, skin rash with intense itching (often beginning in fingertips and around groin area and rapidly spreading), and sensations of fever, nausea, and vomiting. Any other symptoms that seem even remotely suspicious must be taken very seriously.  However, more mild allergy symptoms, such as a rash, can occur at any time during treatment, even up to a week after treatment has ceased.  For some people allergic to amoxicillin, the side effects can be fatal due to [[anaphylaxis]].\n\nUse of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination for more than one week has caused mild [[hepatitis]] in some patients. Young children having ingested acute overdoses of amoxicillin manifested [[lethargy]], vomiting, and [[Renal failure|renal dysfunction]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid-induced hepatitis | journal = Am.

The rash can also occur in adults.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe rash is described as [[maculopapular]] or morbilliform ([[Measles|measles-like]]; therefore, in medical literature, it is called \"amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rash\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2654598 |title=Role of delayed cellular hypersensitivity and adhesion molecules in amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rashes |publisher=Cat.inist.fr |accessdate=2010-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229151904/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2654598 |archivedate=2011-12-29 |df= }}</ref>). It starts on the trunk and can spread from there. This rash is unlikely to be a true allergic reaction and is not a contraindication for future amoxicillin usage, nor should the current regimen necessarily be stopped.

Le Guin]] and first published by the [[small press]] Parnassus in 1968. It is regarded as a classic of fantasy and children's literature and has been widely influential within the genre.\n\nThe story is set in the fictional [[archipelago]] of [[Earthsea (universe)|Earthsea]] and centers around a young [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]] named [[Ged (Earthsea)|Ged]], born in a village on the island of Gont. He displays great power while still a boy and joins the school of wizardry, where his prickly nature drives him into conflict with one of his fellows. During a magical duel, Ged's spell goes awry and releases a shadow creature that attacks him. The novel follows his journey as he seeks to be free of the creature.\n\nThe book has often been described as a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' or coming-of-age story, as it explores Ged's process of learning to cope with power and come to terms with death. The novel also carries [[Taoism|Taoist]] themes about a fundamental balance in the universe of Earthsea, which wizards are supposed to maintain, closely tied to the idea that language and names have power to affect the material world and alter this balance. The structure of the story is similar to that of a traditional epic, although critics have also described it as subverting this genre in many ways, such as by making the protagonist [[Person of color|dark-skinned]] in contrast to more typical [[White people|white-skinned]] heroes.\n\n''A Wizard of Earthsea'' received highly positive reviews, initially as a work for children and later among a general audience, as well. It won the [[Boston Globe\u2013Horn Book Award]] in 1969 and was one of the final recipients of the [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]] in 1979. [[Margaret Atwood]] called it one of the \"wellsprings\" of fantasy literature.{{sfn|Russell|2014}} Le Guin wrote five subsequent books that are collectively referred to as the ''[[Earthsea|Earthsea Cycle]]'', together with ''A Wizard of Earthsea'': ''[[The Tombs of Atuan]]'' (1971), ''[[The Farthest Shore]]'' (1972), ''[[Tehanu]]'' (1990), ''[[The Other Wind]]'' (2001), and ''[[Tales from Earthsea]]'' (2001). [[George Slusser]] has described the series as a \"work of high style and imagination\",{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32\u201335}} while [[Amanda Craig]] said that ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' was \"the most thrilling, wise, and beautiful children's novel ever\".{{sfn|Craig|2003}}\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Ursula K Le Guin.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Refer to caption|Le Guin giving a reading in 2008]]\n\nEarly concepts for the Earthsea setting were developed in two short stories, \"[[The Rule of Names]]\" (1964) and \"[[The Word of Unbinding]]\" (1964), both published in ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=80\u201381}} The stories were later collected in Le Guin's anthology ''[[The Wind's Twelve Quarters]]'' (1975).{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=111}} Earthsea was also used as the setting for a story Le Guin wrote in 1965 or 1966, which was never published.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=25}} In 1967, Herman Schein (the publisher of Parnassus Press and the husband of [[Ruth Robbins]], the illustrator of the book){{sfn|Schein|1962}} asked Le Guin to try writing a book \"for older kids\", giving her complete freedom over the subject and the approach.{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=xi}} Le Guin had no previous experience specifically with the genre of young adult literature, which rose in prominence during the late 1960s.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=9\u201311}} Drawing from her short stories, Le Guin began work on ''A Wizard of Earthsea''. Le Guin has said that the book was in part a response to the image of wizards as ancient and wise, and to her wondering where they come from.{{sfn|Le Guin|Wood|1980|p=41}} Le Guin later said that she chose the medium of fantasy, and the theme of coming of age, with her intended adolescent audience in mind.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=22}}\n\nThe short stories published in 1964 introduced the world of [[Earthsea]] and important concepts in it, such as Le Guin's [[Earthsea (universe)#Magic in Earthsea|treatment of magic]]. It also introduced Yevaud, a dragon who featured briefly in ''A Wizard of Earthsea''.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=80}} Le Guin's depiction of Earthsea was influenced by her familiarity with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] legends as well as [[Norse mythology]].{{sfn|Griffin|1996}}{{sfn|Spivack|1984a|p=2}} Her knowledge of myths and legends, as well as her familial interest in anthropology, have been described by scholar Donna White as allowing her to create \"entire cultures\" for the islands of Earthsea.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=9\u201311}} The influence of Norse lore in particular can be seen in the characters of the Kargs, who are blonde and blue-eyed, and worship two gods who are brothers.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} The influence of [[Taoism|Taoist thought]] on Le Guin's writing is also visible in the idea of a cosmic \"balance\" in the universe of Earthsea.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}}\n\n== Book ==\n\n===Setting===\n{{Quote box\n| quote= \"Only in silence the word, <br> only in dark the light, <br> only in dying life: <br> bright the hawk's flight <br> on the empty sky.\"\n| source=From the ''Creation of \u00c9a'', with which ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' begins.{{sfn|Le Guin|2012}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=87}}\n| align=right\n| width=12em\n}}\nEarthsea itself is an [[archipelago]] or group of islands. In the fictional history of this world, the islands were raised from the ocean by Segoy, an ancient deity or hero. The world is inhabited by both humans and dragons, and several among the humans are sorcerers or wizards.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=8}} The world is shown as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody in each of the original trilogy of novels.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=9\u201310}} The setting of Earthsea is [[Pre-industrial society|preindustrial]], and has many cultures within the widespread archipelago. Most of the characters of the story are of the Hardic peoples, who are dark-skinned, and who populate most of the islands.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=97}} Some of the Eastern islands are populated by the white-skinned [[Karg]]ish people, who see the Hardic folk as evil sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are viewed by the Hardic as barbarians. The far western regions of the archipelago are where the dragons live.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=97}}\n\n=== Plot summary ===\nThe novel follows a young boy called [[Ged (Earthsea)|Duny]], nicknamed \"Sparrowhawk\", born on the island of Gont. Discovering that the boy has great innate power, his aunt teaches him the little magic she knows.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=80}} When his village is attacked by Kargish raiders, Duny summons a fog to conceal the village and its inhabitants, enabling the residents to drive off the Kargs.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} Hearing of this, the powerful mage [[Aihal|Ogion]] takes him as an apprentice, giving him his \"true name\"\u2014Ged.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=80}} Ogion tries to teach Ged about the \"equilibrium\", the concept that magic can upset the natural order of the world if used improperly. In an attempt to impress a girl, however, Ged searches Ogion's spell books and inadvertently summons a strange shadow, which has to be banished by Ogion. Sensing Ged's eagerness to act and impatience with his slow teaching methods, Ogion sends him to the renowned school for wizards on the island of Roke.\n\nAt the school, Ged's skills inspire admiration even among the teachers. He is befriended by an older student named Vetch, but generally remains aloof from his fellows. Another student, Jasper, acts condescendingly towards Ged and provokes the latter's proud nature. After Jasper needles Ged during a feast, Ged challenges him to a duel of magic.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} Ged casts a powerful spell intended to raise the spirit of a legendary dead woman, but the spell goes awry and instead releases a shadow creature, which attacks him and scars his face. The Archmage Nemmerle drives the shadow away, but at the cost of his life.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=80}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=97}}\n\nGed spends many months healing before resuming his studies. The new Archmage, Gensher, describes the shadow as an ancient evil that wishes to [[demonic possession|possess]] Ged, and warns him that the creature has no name. Ged eventually receives his wizard's staff,{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} and takes up residence in the Ninety Isles, providing the poor villagers protection from the dragons that have seized and taken up residence on the nearby island of Pendor, but discovers that he is still being sought by the shadow. Knowing that he cannot guard against both threats at the same time, he sails to Pendor and gambles his life on a guess of the adult dragon's true name. When he is proved right, the dragon offers to tell him the name of the shadow, but Ged instead extracts a promise that the dragon and his offspring will never threaten the archipelago.\n\nChased by the shadow, Ged flees to Osskil, having heard of the stone of the Terrenon. He is attacked by the shadow, and barely escapes into the Court of Terrenon. Serret, the lady of the castle, shows him the stone, and urges Ged to speak to it, claiming it can give him limitless knowledge and power. Recognizing that the stone harbors one of the Old Powers\u2014ancient, powerful, malevolent beings\u2014Ged refuses. He flees and is pursued by the stone's minions, but [[Shapeshifting|transforms]] into a swift falcon and escapes.\n\nGed flies back to Ogion on Gont. Unlike Gensher, Ogion insists that all creatures have a name and advises Ged to confront the shadow.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} Ogion is proved right; when Ged seeks out the shadow, it flees from him. Ged pursues it in a small sailboat, until it lures him into a fog where the boat is wrecked on a [[reef]]. Ged recovers with the help of an elderly couple marooned on a small island since they were children; the woman gives Ged part of a broken bracelet as a gift. Ged patches his boat and resumes his pursuit of the creature into the East Reach. On the island of Iffish, he meets his friend Vetch, who insists on joining him.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=97}} They journey east far beyond the last known lands before they finally come upon the shadow. Naming it with his own name, Ged merges with it and joyfully tells Vetch he is healed and whole.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=80}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|pp=98\u201399}}\n\n=== Illustrations ===\n\n[[File:Robbins Wizard of Earthsea 10 The Open Sea.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=a man with black skin standing with a staff in the stern of a small sailing boat, which has eyes either side of the bows; he wears a cloak.

''[[The Farthest Shore]]'' was written as a third volume after further consideration, and was published in 1972.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=80\u201381}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=9, 24}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=110}} ''The Tombs of Atuan'' tells of the story of Ged's attempt to make whole the ring of Erreth Akbe, half of which is buried in the tombs of Atuan in the Kargish lands, from where he must steal it. There, he meets the child priestess Tenar, on whom the book focuses.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=80\u201381}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=110}} In ''The Farthest Shore'', Ged, who has become Archmage, tries to combat a dwindling of magic across Earthsea, accompanied by Arren, a young prince.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=80\u201381}} The first three books are together seen as the \"original trilogy\";{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=80\u201381}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=110}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=9}} in each of these, Ged is shown as trying to heal some imbalance in the world.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=110}} They were followed by ''[[Tehanu]]'' (1990), ''[[Tales from Earthsea]]'' (2001), and ''[[The Other Wind]]'' (2001), which are sometimes referred to as the \"second trilogy\".{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=110}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=6, 7, 89, 96}}\n\n== Reception ==\n\n===As children's literature===\nInitial recognition for the book was from children's-book critics, among whom it garnered acclaim.{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=81}} ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' received an even more positive response in the United Kingdom when it was released there in 1971, which, according to White, reflected the greater admiration of British critics for children's fantasy.{{sfn|White|1999|p=11}} In her 1975 annotated collection ''Fantasy for Children'', British critic [[Naomi Lewis]] described it in the following terms: \"[It is not] the easiest book for casual browsing, but readers who take the step will find themselves in one of the most important works of fantasy of our time.\"{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}} Similarly, literary scholar Margaret Esmonde wrote in 1981 that \"Le Guin has&nbsp;... enriched children's literature with what may be its finest high fantasy\",{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}} while a review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' by author and journalist [[Amanda Craig]] said it was \"The most thrilling, wise and beautiful children's novel ever, [written] in prose as taut and clean as a ship's sail.\"{{sfn|Craig|2003}} In discussing the book for a gathering of children's librarians [[Eleanor Cameron]] praised the world building in the story, saying \"it is as if [Le Guin] herself has lived on the archipelago.\"{{sfn|White|1999|p=12}} Author David Mitchell called the titular character Ged a \"superb creation\", and argued that he was a more relatable wizard than those featured in prominent works of fantasy at the time. According to him, characters such as [[Gandalf]] were \"variants on the archetype of Merlin, a Caucasian scholarly aristocrat amongst sorcerers\" with little room to grow, whereas Ged developed as a character through his story.{{sfn|Mitchell|2015}} Mitchell also praised the other characters in the story, who he said seemed to have a \"fully thought-out inner life\" despite being fleeting presences.{{sfn|Mitchell|2015}} The 1995 ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' said that the Earthsea books had been considered the finest science fiction books for children in the post-World War II period.{{sfn|Nicholls|1995a}}\n\n===As fantasy===\nCommentators have noted that the Earthsea novels in general received less critical attention because they were considered children's books. Le Guin herself took exception to this treatment of [[children's literature]], describing it as \"adult chauvinist piggery\".{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}} In 1976, literary scholar George Slusser criticized the \"silly publication classification designating the original series as 'children's literature'\".{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=96}} Barbara Bucknall stated that \"Le Guin was not writing for young children when she wrote these fantasies, nor yet for adults. She was writing for 'older kids.' But in fact she can be read, like Tolkien, by ten-year-olds and by adults. These stories are ageless because they deal with problems that confront us at any age.\"{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=96}} Only in later years did ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' receive attention from a more general audience.{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}} Literary scholar T. A. Shippey was among the first to treat ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' as serious literature, assuming in his analysis of the volume that it belonged alongside works by [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], among others.{{sfn|White|1999|p=23}} Margaret Atwood said that she saw the book as \"a fantasy book for adults\",{{sfn|Russell|2014}} and added that the book could be categorized as either young adult fiction or as fantasy, but since it dealt with themes such as \"life and mortality and who are we as human beings\", it could be read and enjoyed by anybody older than twelve.{{sfn|Russell|2014}} The ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' echoed this view, saying the series's appeal went \"far beyond\" the young adults for whom it was written.{{sfn|Nicholls|1995a}} It went on to praise the book as \"austere but vivid\", and said the series was more thoughtful than the ''[[Narnia]]'' books by C. S. Lewis.{{sfn|Nicholls|1995b}} In his 1980 history of fantasy, [[Brian Attebery]] called the Earthsea trilogy \"the most challenging and richest American fantasy to date\".{{sfn|White|1999|p=37}} Slusser described the Earthsea cycle as a \"work of high style and imagination\",{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32\u201335}} and the original trilogy of books a product of \"genuine epic vision\".{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=86}} In 1974, critic [[Robert Scholes]] compared Le Guin's work favorably to that of [[C. S. Lewis]], saying, \"Where C. S. Lewis worked out a specifically Christian set of values, Ursula LeGuin works not with a theology but with an ecology, a cosmology, a reverence for the universe as a self-regulating structure.\"{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}} He added that Le Guin's three Earthsea novels were themselves a sufficient legacy for anybody to leave.{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}} In 2014 David Pringle called it \"a beautiful story\u2014poetic, thrilling, and profound\".{{sfn|Pringle|2014|loc=chpt. 39}}\n\n===Accolades===\n''A Wizard of Earthsea'' won or contributed to several notable awards for Le Guin.

[[Margaret Atwood]] has called ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' one of the \"wellsprings\" of fantasy literature,{{sfn|Russell|2014}} illustrating Le Guin's influence within the genre. ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' has been compared to major works of [[high fantasy]] such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''{{sfn|Craig|2003}}{{sfn|Kuznets|1985}} and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. The notion that names can exert power is also present in [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s 2001 film ''[[Spirited Away]]''; critics have suggested that that idea originated with Le Guin's Earthsea series.{{sfn|Reider|2005}} Novelist [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]], author of books such as ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'', described ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' as having a strong influence on him, and said that he felt a desire to \"wield words with the same power as Ursula Le Guin\".{{sfn|Kerridge|2015}}\n\nModern writers have credited ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' for introducing the idea of a \"wizard school\", which would later be made famous by the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of books,{{sfn|Craig|2003}} and with popularizing the trope of a boy wizard, also present in ''Harry Potter''.{{sfn|Power|2016}} Reviewers have also commented that the basic premise of ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', that of a talented boy going to a wizard's school and making an enemy with whom he has a close connection, is also the premise of ''Harry Potter''.{{sfn|Power|2016}} Ged also receives a scar from the shadow, which hurts whenever the shadow is near him, just as Harry Potter's scar from [[Voldemort]]. Commenting on the similarity, Le Guin said that she did not feel that [[J. K. Rowling]] \"ripped her off\", but that Rowling's books received too much praise for supposed originality, and that Rowling \"could have been more gracious about her predecessors. My incredulity was at the critics who found the first book wonderfully original. She has many virtues, but originality isn't one of them. That hurt.\"{{sfn|Jaggi|2005}}\n\n== Themes ==\n\n===Coming of age===\n''A Wizard of Earthsea'' focuses on Ged's adolescence and coming of age,{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=80}} and along with the other two works of the original Earthsea trilogy forms a part of Le Guin's dynamic portrayal of the process of growing old.{{sfn|Spivack|1984b}} The three novels together follow Ged from youth to old age, and each of them also follow the coming of age of a different character.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=9}} The novel is frequently described as a ''[[Bildungsroman]]''.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=97}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=91}} [[Mike Cadden]] stated that the book is a convincing tale \"to a reader as young and possibly as headstrong as Ged, and therefore sympathetic to him\".{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=91}} Ged's coming of age is also intertwined with the physical journey he undertakes through the novel.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=99}}\n\nGed is depicted as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=92\u201393}} Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually realize that there is a price to be paid for his actions,{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=92\u201393}} as he learns to discipline his magical powers.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=30}} Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=97}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=31\u201332}}\n\nThe passage at the end of the novel, wherein Ged finally accepts the shadow as a part of himself and is thus released from its terror, has been pointed to by reviewers as a [[rite of passage]]. Jeanne Walker, for example, wrote that the rite of passage at the end was an analogue for the entire plot of ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', and that the plot itself plays the role of a rite of passage for an adolescent reader.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=99\u2013100}}{{sfn|White|1999|pp=34\u201335}} Walker goes on to say, \"The entire action of A Wizard of Earthsea&nbsp;... portrays the hero's slow realization of what it means to be an individual in society and a self in relation to higher powers.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=99\u2013100}} Many readers and critics have commented on similarities between Ged's process of growing up and ideas in [[Self in Jungian psychology|Jungian psychology]]. The young Ged has a scary encounter with a [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow creature]], which he later realizes is the dark side of himself. It is only after he recognizes and merges with the shadow that he becomes a whole person.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=28\u201329}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=100}} Le Guin claimed never to have read [[Carl Jung|Jung]] before writing the Earthsea novels.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=28\u201329}}{{sfn|White|1999|p=17}}\n\nLe Guin described coming of age as the main theme of the book, and wrote in a 1973 essay that she chose that theme since she was writing for an adolescent audience. She stated that \"Coming of age&nbsp;... is a process that took me many years; I finished it, so far as I ever will, at about age thirty-one; and so I feel rather deeply about it. So do most adolescents. It's their main occupation, in fact.\"{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=22}} She also said that fantasy was best suited as a medium for describing coming of age, because exploring the subconscious was difficult using the language of \"rational daily life\".{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=22}} The coming of age that Le Guin focused on included not just psychological development, but moral changes as well.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=24}} Ged needs to recognize the balance between his power and his responsibility to use it well, a recognition which comes as he travels to the stone of Terrenon and sees the temptation that that power represents.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=99}}\n\n===Equilibrium and Taoist themes===\nThe world of Earthsea is depicted as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody in each of the original trilogy of novels. This includes an equilibrium between land and sea (implicit in the name Earthsea), and between people and their natural environment.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=9\u201310}} In addition to physical equilibrium, there is a larger cosmic equilibrium, which everybody is aware of, and which wizards are tasked with maintaining.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=25\u201326}} Describing this aspect of Earthsea, Elizabeth Cummins wrote, \"The principle of balanced powers, the recognition that every act affects self, society, world, and cosmos, is both a physical and a moral principle of Le Guin's fantasy world.\"{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=26}} The concept of balance is related to the novel's other major theme of coming of age, as Ged's knowledge of the consequences of his own actions for good or ill is necessary for him to understand how the balance is maintained.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=28\u201329}} While at the school of Roke, the Master Hand tells him: {{quote|But you must not change one thing, one pebble, one grain of sand, until you know what good and evil will follow on that act. The world is in balance, in Equilibrium. A wizard's power of Changing and of Summoning can shake the balance of the world. It is dangerous, that power. It is most perilous. It must follow knowledge, and serve need. To light a candle is to cast a shadow.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}}{{sfn|Le Guin|2012|p=51}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=32}}}}\n\nThe influence of Taoism on Le Guin's writing is evident through much of the book, especially in her depiction of the \"balance\". At the end of the novel, Ged, may be seen to embody the Taoist way of life, as he has learned not to act unless absolutely necessary.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} He has also learned that seeming opposites, like light and dark or good and evil, are actually interdependent.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} Light and dark themselves are recurring images within the story.{{sfn|White|1999|p=37}} Reviewers have identified this belief as evidence of a conservative ideology within the story, shared with much of fantasy. In emphasizing concerns over balance and equilibrium, scholars have argued, Le Guin essentially justifies the status quo, which wizards strive to maintain.{{sfn|White|1999|p=36}} This tendency is in contrast to Le Guin's science fiction writing, in which change is shown to have value.{{sfn|White|1999|p=36}}\n\nThe nature of human evil forms a significant related theme through ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' as well as the other Earthsea novels.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32\u201335}} As with other works by Le Guin, evil is shown as a misunderstanding of the balance of life. Ged is born with great power in him, but the pride that he takes in his power leads to his downfall; he tries to demonstrate his strength by bringing a spirit back from the dead, and in performing this act against the laws of nature, releases the shadow that attacks him.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32\u201336}} Slusser suggests that although he is provoked into performing dangerous spells first by the girl on Gont and then by Jasper, this provocation exists in Ged's mind. He is shown as unwilling to look within himself and see the pride that drives him to do what he does.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32\u201336}} When he accepts the shadow into himself, he also finally accepts responsibility for his own actions,{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32\u201336}} and by accepting his own mortality he is able to free himself.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|p=37}} His companion Vetch describes the moment by saying {{quote|that Ged had neither lost nor won but, naming the shadow of his death with his own name, had made himself whole: a man: who, knowing his whole true self, cannot be used or possessed by any power other than himself, and whose life therefore is lived for life's sake and never in the service of ruin, or pain, or hatred, or the dark.{{sfn|Le Guin|2012|p=214}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=37}}}}\n\nThus, although there are several dark powers in Earthsea (like the dragon, and the stone of Terrenon) the true evil was not one of these powers, or even death, but Ged's actions that went against the balance of nature.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=37\u201338}} Although evil is present in the books, it is a non-Christian understanding of evil: evil is a \"misunderstanding of the dynamics of life\".{{sfn|White|1999|p=18}} This is contrary to conventional Western storytelling, in which light and darkness are often considered opposites, and are seen as symbolizing good and evil, which are constantly in conflict.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=34}} On two different occasions, Ged is tempted to try to defy death and evil, but eventually learns that neither can be eliminated: instead, he chooses not to serve evil, and stops denying death.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=36}}\n\n===True names===\nIn Le Guin's fictional universe, to know the [[true name]] of an object or a person is to have power over it.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=111}}{{sfn|Slusser|1976|p=37}} Each child is given a true name when they reach puberty, a name which they share only with close friends.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=27}} Several of the dragons in the later Earthsea novels, like Orm Embar and Kalessin, are shown as living openly with their names, which do not give anybody power over them.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=111}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=108\u2013109}} In ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', however, Ged is shown to have power over Yevaud. Cadden writes that this is because Yevaud still has attachment to riches and material possessions, and is thus bound by the power of his name.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=108\u2013109}} Wizards exert their influence over the equilibrium through the use of names, thus linking this theme to Le Guin's depiction of a cosmic balance. According to Cummins, this is Le Guin's way of demonstrating the power of language in shaping reality. Since language is the tool we use for communicating about the environment, she argues that it also allows humans to affect the environment, and the wizards' power to use names symbolizes this.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=11}} Cummins went on to draw an analogy between the a wizard's use of names to change things with the creative use of words in fictional writing.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=27}} Shippey wrote that Earthsea magic seems to work through what he called the \"Rumpelstiltskin theory\", in which names have power. He argued that this portrayal was part of Le Guin's effort to emphasize the power of words over objects, which, according to Shippey, was in contrast to the ideology of other fantasy writers, such as [[James Frazer]] in ''[[The Golden Bough]]''.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=21\u201322}} Esmonde argued that each of the first three Earthsea books hinged on an act of trust. In ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', Vetch trusts Ged with his true name when the latter is at his lowest ebb emotionally, thus giving Ged complete power over himself. Ged later offers Tenar the same gift in ''The Tombs of Atuan'', thereby allowing her to learn trust.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n== Style and structure ==\n===Language and mood===\n''A Wizard of Earthsea'' and other novels of the Earthsea cycle differ notably from Le Guin's early [[Hainish cycle]] works, although they were written at a similar time.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32\u201335}} George Slusser described the Earthsea works as providing a counterweight to the \"excessive pessimism\" of the Hainish novels.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32\u201335}} He saw the former as depicting individual action in a favorable light, in contrast to works such as \"[[Vaster than Empires and More Slow]]\".{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32\u201335}} The ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' said the book was pervaded by a \"grave joyfulness\".{{sfn|Nicholls|1995b}} In discussing the style of her fantasy works, Le Guin herself said that in fantasy it was necessary to be clear and direct with language, because there is no known framework for the reader's mind to rest upon.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32\u201335}}\n\nThe story often appears to assume that readers are familiar with the geography and history of Earthsea, a technique which allowed Le Guin to avoid [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]]:{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=86\u201388}} a reviewer wrote that this method \"gives Le Guin's world the mysterious depths of Tolkien's, but without his tiresome back-stories and versifying\".{{sfn|Craig|2003}} In keeping with the notion of an epic, the narration switches from looking ahead into Ged's future and looking back into the past of Earthsea.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=86\u201388}} At the same time, Slusser described the mood of the novel as \"strange and dreamlike\", fluctuating between objective reality and the thoughts in Ged's mind; some of Ged's adversaries are real, while others are phantoms.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=35\u201338}} This narrative technique, which Cadden characterizes as \"free indirect discourse\" makes the narrator of the book seem sympathetic to the protagonist, and does not distance his thoughts from the reader.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=91\u201393}}\n\n===Myth and epic===\n''A Wizard of Earthsea'' has strong elements of an [[epic (genre)|epic]]; for instance, Ged's place in Earthsea history is described at the very beginning of the book in the following terms: \"some say the greatest, and surely the greatest voyager, was the man called Sparrowhawk, who in his day became both dragonlord and Archmage.\"{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=86\u201388}} The story also begins with words from the Earthsea song \"The Creation of \u00c9a\", which forms a ritualistic beginning to the book.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=86\u201388}} The teller of the story then goes on to say that it is from Ged's youth, thereby establishing context for the rest of the book.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=86\u201388}} In comparison with the protagonists of many of Le Guin's other works, Ged is superficially a typical hero, a mage who sets out on a quest.{{sfn|Rochelle|2001|p=48}} Reviewers have compared ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' to epics such as ''[[Beowulf]]''.{{sfn|White|1999|p=24}} Scholar Virginia White argued that the story followed a structure common to epics in which the protagonist begins an adventure, faces trials along the way, and eventually returns in triumph. White went on to suggest that this structure can be seen in the series as a whole, as well as in the individual volumes.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nLe Guin subverted many of the tropes typical to such \"monomyths\"; the protagonists of her story were all [[Person of color|dark-skinned]], in comparison to the [[White people|white-skinned]] heroes more traditionally used; the Kargish antagonists, in contrast, were white-skinned, a switching of race roles that has been remarked upon by multiple critics.{{sfn|Kuznets|1985}}{{sfn|Rochelle|2001|pp=48, 53}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=107}} Critics have also cited her use of characters from multiple class backgrounds as a choice subversive to conventional Western fantasy.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=107}} At the same time, reviewers questioned Le Guin's treatment of gender in ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', and the original trilogy as a whole. Le Guin, who later became known as a [[Feminism|feminist]], chose to restrict the use of magic to men and boys in the first volume of Earthsea.{{sfn|Craig|2003}} Initial critical reactions to ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' saw Ged's gender as incidental.{{sfn|Nodelman|1995|p=182}} In contrast, ''The Tombs of Atuan'' saw Le Guin intentionally tell a female coming-of-age story, which was nonetheless described as perpetuating a male-dominated model of Earthsea.{{sfn|Butler|2012}} ''Tehanu'' (1990), published as the fourth volume of ''Earthsea'' 18 years after the third, has been described both by Le Guin and her commentators as a feminist re-imagining of the series, in which the power and status of the chief characters are reversed, and the patriarchal social structure questioned.{{sfn|Hollindale|2003}}{{sfn|Hatfield|1993|p=43}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=98}} Commenting in 1993, Le Guin wrote that she could not continue [Earthsea after 1972] until she had \"wrestled with the angels of the feminist consciousness\".{{sfn|Hollindale|2003}}\n\nSeveral critics have argued that by combining elements of epic, ''Bildungsroman'', and young adult fiction, Le Guin succeeded in blurring the boundaries of conventional genres.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=99}} In a 1975 commentary Francis Molson argued that the series should be referred to as \"ethical fantasy\", a term which acknowledged that the story did not always follow the tropes of heroic fantasy, and the moral questions that it raised. The term did not become popular.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=25\u201327}} A similar argument was made by children's literature critic Cordelia Sherman in 1985; she argued that ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' and the rest of the series sought \"to teach children by dramatic example what it means to be a good adult\".{{sfn|White|1999|p=38}}\n\n== Adaptations ==\nA condensed, illustrated version of the first chapter was printed by [[World Books]] in the third volume of ''[[Childcraft]]'' in 1989.<ref>{{cite book|title=Childcraft: Stories and poems|year=1989|publisher=World Book, Inc.|pages=176\u2013187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yzkKAAAAIAAJ&q=Earthsea#search_anchor|chapter=The Boy Who Became A Wizard}}</ref> Multiple audio versions of the book have been released.

An original mini-series titled ''[[Legend of Earthsea]]'' was broadcast in 2005 on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]. It is based very loosely on ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' and ''The Tombs of Atuan''. In an article published in ''Salon'', Le Guin expressed strong displeasure at the result. She stated that by casting a \"petulant white kid\" as Ged (who has red-brown skin in the book) the series \"[[Whitewashing in film|whitewashed]] Earthsea\", and had ignored her choice to write the story of a non-white character, a choice she said was central to the book.{{sfn|Le Guin|2004}} This sentiment was shared by a review in ''The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', which said that ''Legend of Earthsea'' \"totally missed the point\" of Le Guin's novels, \"ripping out all the subtlety, nuance and beauty of the books and inserting boring cliches, painful stereotypes and a very unwelcome 'epic' war in their place\".{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=145}}\n\n[[Studio Ghibli]] released an adaptation of the series in 2006 titled ''[[Tales from Earthsea (film)|Tales from Earthsea]]''.{{sfn|Hairston|2010|p=183}} The film very loosely combines elements of the first, third, and fourth books into a new story. Le Guin commented with displeasure on the film-making process, saying that she had acquiesced to the adaptation believing [[Hayao Miyazaki]] would be producing the film himself, which was eventually not the case. Le Guin praised the imagery of the film, but disliked the use of violence. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the portrayal of morality, and in particular the use of a villain who could be slain as a means of resolving conflict, which she said was antithetical to the message of the book.{{sfn|Le Guin|2011}} The film received generally mixed responses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gedo_senki_tales_from_earthsea|title=Gedo Senki (Tales From Earthsea)|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book | title=Ursula K.

Both interested in music, they decided to form a band. Lifeson was primarily a self-taught guitarist with the only formal instruction coming from a high school friend in 1971 who taught classical guitar lessons. This training lasted for roughly a year and a half.\n\nLifeson recalls what inspired him to play guitar in a 2008 interview:\n\n{{quote|My brother-in-law played flamenco guitar.

''Vapor Trails'' is the first Rush album since the 1970s to lack keyboards\u2014as such, Lifeson used over 50 different guitars in what [[Shawn Hammond]] of ''Guitar Player'' called \"his most rabid and experimental playing ever.\" Geddy Lee was amenable to leaving keyboards off the album due in part to Lifeson's ongoing concern about their use. Lifeson's approach to the guitar tracks for the album eschewed traditional guitar riffs and solos in favour of \"tonality and harmonic quality.\"<ref name=Hammond/>\n\nDuring live performances, he is still responsible for cuing various guitar effects, the use of bass pedal synthesizers, and backing vocals.\n\n===''Victor''===\nWhile the bulk of&nbsp;Lifeson's work in music has been with Rush, his first major outside work was his solo project, ''[[Victor (album)|Victor]]'', released in 1996. ''Victor'' was attributed as a self-titled work (i.e. ''Victor'' is attributed as the ''artist'' as well as the ''album title''). This was done deliberately as an alternative to issuing the album explicitly under Lifeson's name. The title track is from the [[W.&nbsp;H. Auden]] poem, also entitled \"Victor\". Both son Adrian and wife Charlene also contributed to the album. A follow-up album, possibly including vocals by [[Sarah McLachlan]], was rumoured in the late 1990s, but was apparently shelved due to Atlantic Records' lack of support for the first album.<ref>{{cite web |author=Eric Hansen |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/VIClyrics.htm |title=Alex Lifeson's \"Victor\" linernotes and lyrics from Power Windows |publisher=2112.net |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702083720/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/VIClyrics.htm |archivedate=2 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Side projects===\n{{main article|List of songs recorded by Rush#Alex Lifeson}}\nLifeson has also contributed to a body of work outside his involvement with the band in the form of instrumental contributions to other musical outfits.

Later, in 1990, he appeared on [[Lawrence Gowan]]'s album, ''[[Lost Brotherhood]]'' to play guitar. In 1995, he guested on two tracks on [[Tom Cochrane]]'s ''[[Ragged Ass Road]]'' album and then in 1996 on [[I Mother Earth]]'s \"Like a Girl\" from the ''[[Scenery and Fish]]'' album.

Lifeson made a guest appearance on the 2007 album ''[[Fear of a Blank Planet]]'' by UK progressive rock band, [[Porcupine Tree]], contributing a solo during the song ''[[Anesthetize]]''. He also appeared on the 2008 album ''[[Tiles (band)#About \"Fly Paper\"|Fly Paper]]'' by Detroit progressive rockers [[Tiles (band)|Tiles]]. He plays on the track \"Sacred and Mundane\". Outside band related endeavours, Lifeson composed the theme for the first season of the science-fiction TV series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]''.

In 2003, he was featured in an episode titled \"[[Closer to the Heart]]\", playing a partly fictional version of himself. In the story, he is kidnapped by [[Robb Wells|Ricky]] and held as punishment for his inability (or refusal) to provide the main characters with free tickets to a Rush concert. In the end of the episode, Alex reconciles with the characters, and performs a duet of \"Closer to the Heart\" with [[Mike Smith (actor)|Bubbles]] at the trailer park. In 2006, Lifeson appeared in ''[[Trailer Park Boys: The Movie]]'' as a traffic cop in the opening scene and in 2009 he appeared in their follow up movie, ''[[Trailer Park Boys: Countdown to Liquor Day]]'', as an undercover vice cop in drag.

He had a [[Fender Stratocaster]] with a [[Bill Lawrence (guitar maker)|Bill Lawrence]] humbucker and [[Floyd Rose]] vibrato bridge as backup \"and for a different sound.\"<ref name=\"cohen\"/> For the ''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'' sessions, Lifeson began using a [[Gibson EDS-1275]] for songs like \"[[Xanadu (Rush song)|Xanadu]]\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Alex Lifeson Double Neck|url=http://www.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/2015/Custom/Alex-Lifeson-Double-Neck.aspx}}</ref> and his main guitar became a white [[Gibson ES-355]].<ref name=cohen/> During this period Lifeson used [[Hiwatt]] amplifiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/prime-cuts-rush |title=Prime Cuts: Rush |publisher=Guitar World |date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> He played a [[Gibson B series#B-45|twelve-string Gibson B-45]] on songs like \"[[Closer to the Heart]].\"<ref name=cohen/>\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nFrom 1980 to 1986, Lifeson used four identically modified Stratocasters, all of them equipped with the Floyd Rose bridge. As a joke, he called these Hentor Sportscasters \u2013 a made-up name inspired by Peter Henderson's name, who was the producer of ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Grace Under Pressure Tourbook |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/GUPtourbook.htm |website=Power Windows |access-date=10 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224014536/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/GUPtourbook.htm |archive-date=24 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He would start using them again twenty years later.<ref name=WesInterview>{{cite web |last1=Prasad |first1=Anil |title=John Wesley - Dose of Reality |url=https://www.innerviews.org/inner/wesley.html |website=Innerviews |publicationdate=2015| accessdate=18 July 2018}}</ref> He also played a Gibson Howard Roberts Fusion and an Ovation Adamas acoustic/electric guitar.<ref name=cohen/> By 1987, Lifeson switched to Signature guitars (Canadian-made) which, while \"awful to play\u2014very uncomfortable--...had a particular sound I liked.\"<ref name=cohen/> Lifeson primarily used [[PRS Guitars|PRS guitars]] in the later-half of the 1990 Presto tour, and again during the recording of ''[[Roll The Bones]]'' in 1990/1991.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Interview: Alex Lifeson|url = http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Interview_Alex_Lifeson?page=2|website = www.premierguitar.com|access-date = 2016-02-15}}</ref> He would continue to play PRS for the next sixteen years through the recording and touring of ''[[Counterparts (album)|Counterparts]]'', ''[[Test for Echo]]'' and ''[[Vapor Trails]]'' as well as the R30 tour.\n\n===2000s onward: Return to Gibson guitars===\nIn 2011, Lifeson said that for the past few years he \"...used Gibson almost exclusively. There's nothing like having a low-slung Les Paul over my shoulder.\"\n\n====Gibson \"Alex Lifeson Axcess\"====\nIn early 2011, Gibson introduced the \"Alex Lifeson Axcess\", a guitar specially designed for him. These are custom made Les Pauls with [[Floyd Rose| Floyd Rose tremolo]] systems and [[Pickup (music technology)#Piezoelectric pickups|piezoacoustic pick-ups]]. He used these two custom Les Pauls on the [[Time Machine Tour]]. These guitars are also available through Gibson, in a viceroy Brown or Crimson colour. Lifeson used these two guitars heavily on the tour.<ref name=cohen/>\n\nFor the 2012-2013 Clockwork Angels tour, Gibson built an Alex Lifeson Axcess model in black which became Lifeson's primary guitar for much of the show.  For all acoustic work, he played one of his Axcess guitars using the piezo pick-ups; no acoustic guitars were used at all in the Clockwork Angels show.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n====Paul Reed Smith acoustic signature guitar====\nFor the 2015 R40 Tour, Lifeson used his signature acoustic guitar model by [[PRS Guitars|Paul Reed Smith]].

Mike also introduced the Antique White as a new color from Gibson for this Custom (note: Gibson names this color as 'Classic White' on their web site which may be an error due to other Gibson reps labeling it as Antique White). Alex played this Custom on the last Rush tour.\n\n===Amplification===\nIn 2005, Hughes & Kettner introduced an Alex Lifeson signature series amplifier; Lifeson donates his royalties from the sale of these signature models to [[UNICEF]].<ref>{{cite web|title=TriAmp MKII Alex Lifeson |url=http://www.hughes-and-kettner.com/products.php5?id=97&prod=TriAmp%20MKII%20Alex%20Lifeson |publisher=Hughes-and-kettner.com |accessdate=14 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825202747/http://www.hughes-and-kettner.com/products.php5?id=97&prod=TriAmp%20MKII%20Alex%20Lifeson |archivedate=25 August 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Lifeson abandoned his signature Triamps in favour for custom-built Lerxst Omega [[Marshall Amplification|Silver Jubilee]] clones, handmade by Mojotone in Burgaw, NC and [[Mesa Boogie Mark Series|Mesa/Boogie Mark V]] heads.

(Prior to this, Lifeson used [[Moog Taurus]] Bass Pedals before they were replaced by Korg MIDI pedals in the 1980s.) Lifeson and his bandmates share a desire to accurately depict songs from their albums when playing live performances. Toward this goal, beginning in the late 1980s the band equipped their live performances with a capacious rack of samplers. The band members use these samplers in real-time to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, [[accompaniment]]s, vocal [[harmonies]], and other sound \"events\" that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s).<ref name=\"onstagemag.com\" />\n\n==Influence==\nSome artists have cited Lifeson as an influence, including [[Paul Gilbert]] of [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]],<ref>{{ cite web | accessdate = February 28, 2017 | url = http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/paulgilbert-May2004.htm | title = Interview With Paul Gilbert | first = Keith | last = McDonald | quote = ''Q'': Who were your guitar influences?<br />''Paul Gilbert'': Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen, Alex Lifeson [...] | date = May 2004 | website = [[Metal Rules]]}}</ref> [[John Petrucci]] of [[Dream Theater]],<ref>{{ cite web | accessdate = April 4, 2017 | quote = [...] When they played the song \u2018La Villa Strangiato,\u2019 the solo that Alex [Lifeson] played really had a huge influence on me.

File archivers may employ [[lossless data compression]] in their [[archive format]]s to reduce the size of the archive.\n\nBasic archivers just take a list of files and concatenate their contents sequentially into archives. The archive files need to store [[metadata]], at least the names and lengths of the original files, if proper reconstruction is possible. More advanced archivers store additional metadata, such as the [[Timestamping (computing)|original timestamps]], [[file attribute]]s or [[access control list]]s.\n\nThe process of making an archive file is called ''archiving'' or ''packing''. Reconstructing the original files from the archive is termed ''unarchiving'', ''unpacking'' or ''extracting''.\n\n==History==\nAn early archiver was the [[Multics]] command ''archive'', descended from the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]] command of the same name, which was a basic archiver and performed no compression. Multics also had a \"tape_archiver\" command, abbreviated ''ta'', which was perhaps the forerunner of unix' ''tar''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Van Vleck|first1=Tom|title=Multics Glossary - A|url=http://www.multicians.org/mga.html|website=multicians.org|accessdate=Jan 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Unix archivers==\nThe [[Unix]] tools ''[[ar (Unix)|ar]]'', ''[[tar (file format)|tar]]'', ''[[cpio]]'' act as archivers but not compressors. Users of the Unix tools use additional compression tools, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], or [[xz]], to compress the archive file after packing or remove compression before unpacking the archive file. The [[filename extension]]s are successively added at each step of this process. For example, archiving a collection of files with ''tar'' and then compressing the resulting archive file with ''gzip'' results a file with <code>.tar.gz</code> extension.\n\nThis approach has two goals:\n#It follows the [[Unix philosophy]] that each program should accomplish a single task to perfection, as opposed to attempting to accomplish everything with one tool. As compression technology progresses, users may use different compression programs without having to modify or abandon their archiver.\n#The archives use [[solid compression]]. When the files are combined, the compressor can exploit redundancy across several archived files and achieve better compression than a compressor that compresses each files individually.\n\nThis approach, however, has disadvantages too:\n#Extracting or modifying one file is difficult. Extracting one file requires decompressing an entire archive, which can be time- and space-consuming. Modifying one means the file needs to be put back into archive and the archive recompressed again. This operation requires additional time and disk space.\n#The archive becomes damage-prone. If the area holding shared data for several files is damaged, all those files are lost.\n#It's impossible to take advantage of redundancy between files unless the compression window is larger than the size of an individual file.

However, in terms of parentage, all accounts agree that she was the daughter of Zeus and [[Leto]] and that she was the twin sister of Apollo.\n\nAn account by [[Callimachus]] has it that Hera forbade Leto to give birth on either terra firma (the mainland) or on an island. Hera was angry with her husband Zeus because he had impregnated Leto but the island of [[Delos]] disobeyed Hera and Leto gave birth there.\n\nAccording to the [[Homeric Hymn]] to Artemis the island where Leto gave birth was [[Ortygia]].<ref>Hammond. ''Oxford Classical Dictionary.'' 597-598.</ref>\n\nIn ancient Cretan history Leto was worshipped at [[Phaistos]] and, in Cretan mythology, Leto gave birth to Apollo and Artemis on the islands known today as [[Paximadia (islands)|Paximadia]].\n\nA ''[[scholium]]'' of [[Servius]] on ''[[Aeneid]]'' iii. 72 accounts for the island's archaic name Ortygia<ref>Or as a separate island birthplace of Artemis\u2014 \"Rejoice, blessed Leto, for you bare glorious children, the lord Apollon and Artemis who delights in arrows; her in Ortygia, and him in rocky Delos,\" says the [[Homeric Hymn]]; the etymology ''Ortygia'', \"Isle of Quail\", is not supported by modern scholars.</ref> by asserting that Zeus transformed Leto into a [[quail]] (''ortux'') in order to prevent Hera from finding out about his infidelity, and Kenneth McLeish suggested further that in quail form Leto would have given birth with as few birth-pains as a mother quail suffers when it lays an egg.<ref>McLeish, Kenneth. ''Children of the Gods'' pp 33f; Leto's birth-pangs, however, are graphically depicted by ancient sources.</ref>\n\nThe myths also differ as to whether Artemis was born first, or Apollo. Most stories depict Artemis as born first, becoming her mother's midwife upon the birth of her brother Apollo.\n\n=== Childhood ===\nThe childhood of Artemis is not fully related in any surviving myth. The ''[[Iliad]]'' reduced the figure of the dread goddess to that of a girl, who, having been thrashed by [[Hera]], climbs weeping into the lap of Zeus.<ref>''Iliad'' XXI 505-13</ref>\n\nA poem by [[Callimachus]] to the goddess \"who amuses herself on mountains with archery\" imagines some charming vignettes. Artemis, while sitting on the knee of her father, Zeus, asked him to grant her several wishes:\n\n# to always remain a virgin\n# to have many names to set her apart from her brother Phoebus ([[Apollo]])\n# to have a bow and arrow made by the Cyclops\n# to be the Phaesporia or Light Bringer\n# to have a knee-length tunic so that she could hunt\n# to have sixty \"daughters of [[Okeanos]]\", all nine years of age, to be her choir\n# to have twenty Amnisides Nymphs as handmaidens to watch her dogs and bow while she rested\n# to rule all the mountains\n# any city\n# to have the ability to help women in the pains of childbirth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/CallimachusHymns1.html#3|title=Callimachus \u2013 Hymn III to Artemis 1-27}}</ref>\n\nArtemis believed that she had been chosen by [[Moirai|the Fates]] to be a midwife, particularly since she had assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin brother, Apollo.<ref>[http://www.katinkahesselink.net/other/artemis.html On-line English translation].</ref> All of her companions remained virgins, and Artemis closely guarded her own chastity. Her symbols included the golden bow and arrow, the hunting dog, the stag, and the moon. Callimachus tells<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Callimachus \u2013 Hymn III to Artemis 46</ref> how Artemis spent her girlhood seeking out the things that she would need to be a huntress, how she obtained her bow and arrows from the isle of [[Lipari|Lipara]], where [[Hephaestus]] and the [[Cyclops]] worked.\n\nOceanus' daughters were filled with fear, but the young Artemis bravely approached and asked for bow and arrows. Callimachus then tells how Artemis visited [[Pan (god)|Pan]], the god of the forest, who gave her seven bitches and six dogs. She then captured six golden-horned deer to pull her chariot. Artemis practiced with her bow first by shooting at trees and then at wild beasts.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Intimacy ===\nAs a virgin, Artemis had interested many gods and men, but only her hunting companion, [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], won her heart. Orion was accidentally killed either by Artemis or by Gaia.\n\nThe river god [[Alpheus (mythology)|Alpheus]] was in love with Artemis, but as he realizes that he can do nothing to win her heart, he decides to capture her. Artemis, who is with her companions at Letrenoi, goes to Alpheus, but, suspicious of his motives, she covers her face with mud so that the river god does not recognize her. In another story, Alphaeus tries to rape Artemis' attendant [[Arethusa (mythology)|Arethusa]]. Artemis pities Arethusa and saves her by transforming Arethusa into a spring in Artemis' temple, [[Artemis Alphaea]] in Letrini, where the goddess and her attendant drink.\n\nBouphagos, the son of the Titan Iapetus, sees Artemis and thinks about raping her. Reading his sinful thoughts, Artemis strikes him at Mount Pholoe.\n\n{{anchor|Siproites}} Siproites is a boy, who, either because he accidentally sees Artemis bathing or because he attempts to rape her, is turned into a girl by the goddess.\n\n=== Actaeon ===\nMultiple versions of the Actaeon myth survive, though many are fragmentary. The details vary but at the core, they involve a great hunter, [[Actaeon]] who Artemis turns into a stag for a transgression and who is then killed by hunting dogs.<ref>Heath, \"The Failure of Orpheus\", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''124''' (1994:163-196) p. 196.</ref><ref>[[Walter Burkert]], ''Homo Necans'' (1972), translated by Peter Bing (University of California Press) 1983, p 111.</ref> Usually, the dogs are his own, who no longer recognize their master. Sometimes they are Artemis' hounds.\n\nAccording to the standard modern text on the work, Lamar Ronald Lacey's ''The Myth of Aktaion: Literary and Iconographic Studies'', the most likely original version of the myth is that Actaeon was the hunting companion of the goddess who, seeing her naked in her sacred spring, attempts to force himself on her. For this hubris, he is turned into a stag and devoured by his own hounds. However, in some surviving versions, Actaeon is a stranger who happens upon her. According to the Latin version of the story told by the Roman [[Ovid]]<ref>Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' iii.131; see also pseudo-Apollodorus' ''Bibliotheke'' iii. 4</ref> having accidentally seen Artemis (Diana) on [[Mount Cithaeron]] while she was bathing, he was changed by her into a stag, and pursued and killed by his fifty hounds.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Different tellings also diverge in the hunter's transgression, which is sometimes merely seeing the virgin goddess naked, sometimes boasting he is a better hunter than she,<ref>Lacy, \"Aktaion and a Lost 'Bath of Artemis'\" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''110''' (1990:26-42)</ref> or even merely being a rival of Zeus for the affections of [[Semele]].\n\n=== Adonis ===\n[[File:Giuseppe-Mazzuoli-The-Death-of-Adonis-hermitag.jpg|thumb|right|''The Death of Adonis'', by [[Giuseppe Mazzuoli (1644\u20131725)|Giuseppe Mazzuoli]], 1709 \u2013 ''[[Hermitage Museum]]''.]]\nIn some versions of the story of [[Adonis]], who was a late addition to Greek mythology during the Hellenistic period, Artemis sent a [[Boar|wild boar]] to kill Adonis as punishment for his hubristic boast that he was a better hunter than her.\n\nIn other versions, Artemis killed Adonis for revenge. In later myths, Adonis had been related as a favorite of [[Aphrodite]], and Aphrodite was responsible for the death of [[Hippolytus (mythology)#Hippolytus as Virbius|Hippolytus]], who had been a favorite of Artemis. Therefore, Artemis killed Adonis to avenge Hippolytus\u2019s death.\n\nIn yet another version, Adonis was not killed by Artemis, but by Ares, as punishment for being with Aphrodite.\n\n=== Orion ===\n[[Orion (mythology)|Orion]] was Artemis' hunting companion. In some versions, he is killed by Artemis, while in others he is killed by a [[Scorpius#Mythology|scorpion]] sent by [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. In some versions, Orion tries to seduce Opis,<ref>\"Another name for Artemis herself\", [[Karl Kerenyi]] observes, ''The Gods of the Greeks'' (1951:204).</ref> one of Artemis' followers, and she kills him. In a version by [[Aratus]],<ref>Aratus, 638</ref> Orion takes hold of Artemis' robe and she kills him in [[self-defense]].\n\nIn yet another version, Apollo sends the scorpion. According to [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]<ref>Hyginus, ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'', ii.34, quoting the Greek poet Istrus.</ref> Artemis once loved Orion (in spite of the late source, this version appears to be a rare remnant of her as the pre-Olympian goddess, who took consorts, as [[Eos]] did), but was tricked into killing him by her brother Apollo, who was \"protective\" of his sister's maidenhood.\n\n=== The Aloadae ===\nThe twin sons of [[Poseidon]] and [[Iphidemia]], Otos and Ephialtes, grew enormously at a young age. They were aggressive, great hunters, and could not be killed unless they killed each other. The growth of the [[Aloadae]] never stopped, and they boasted that as soon as they could reach heaven, they would kidnap Artemis and [[Hera]] and take them as wives. The gods were afraid of them, except for Artemis who captured a fine deer (or in another version of the story, she changed herself into a doe) and jumped out between them. The Aloadae threw their spears and so mistakenly killed each other.\n\n=== Callisto ===\n\n[[File:Tizian 015.jpg|thumb|''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' by [[Titian]]]]\n\n[[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] was the daughter of Lycaon, King of Arcadia and also was one of Artemis's hunting attendants. As a companion of Artemis, she took a vow of chastity. Zeus appeared to her disguised as Artemis, or in some stories Apollo gained her confidence and took advantage of her or, according to [[Ovid]], raped her. As a result of this encounter, she conceived a son, Arcas.\n\nEnraged, Hera or Artemis (some accounts say both) changed her into a bear. Arcas almost killed the bear, but Zeus stopped him just in time. Out of pity, Zeus placed Callisto the bear into the heavens, thus the origin of Callisto the Bear as a constellation. Some stories say that he placed both Arcas and Callisto into the heavens as bears, forming the [[Ursa Minor]] and [[Ursa Major]] constellations.\n\n=== Iphigenia and the Taurian Artemis ===\nArtemis punished [[Agamemnon]] after he killed a sacred stag in a [[sacred grove]] and boasted that he was a better hunter than the goddess. When the Greek fleet was preparing at [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] to depart for [[Troy]] to begin the [[Trojan War]], Artemis becalmed the winds. The seer [[Calchas]] advised Agamemnon that the only way to appease Artemis was to sacrifice his daughter [[Iphigenia]]. Artemis then snatched Iphigenia from the altar and substituted a deer. Various myths have been told about what happened after Artemis took her. Either she was brought to Tauros and led the priests there or became Artemis' immortal companion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisFavour.html#Iphigeneia |title=FAVOUR OF ARTEMIS : Greek mythology |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |author=Aaron J. Atsma |accessdate=2011-01-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Niobe ===\nA Queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]], [[Niobe]] boasted of her superiority to Leto because while she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven boys and seven girls, Leto had only one of each. When Artemis and Apollo heard this impiety, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, and Artemis shot her daughters, who died instantly without a sound. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions two of the Niobids were spared, one boy and one girl. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, killed himself. A devastated Niobe and her remaining children were turned to stone by Artemis as they wept. The gods themselves entombed them.\n\n=== Chione ===\nChione was a princess of Pokis. She was beloved by two gods, [[Hermes]] and [[Apollo]], and boasted that she was prettier than Artemis because she made two gods fall in love with her at once. Artemis was furious and killed Chione with her arrow or struck her dumb by shooting off her tongue. However, some versions of this myth say Apollo and Hermes protected her from Artemis' wrath.\n\n=== Atalanta, Oeneus and the Meleagrids ===\n[[File:Artemis libation Louvre CA599.jpg|thumb|right|Artemis pouring a libation, c. 460-450 BC.]]\nArtemis saved the infant [[Atalanta]] from dying of exposure after her father abandoned her. She sent a female bear to suckle the baby, who was then raised by hunters. In some stories, Artemis later sent a bear to hurt Atalanta because others claimed Atlanta was a superior hunter.\n\nAmong other adventures, Atalanta participated in the hunt for the [[Calydonian Boar]], which Artemis had sent to destroy [[Calydon]] because King [[Oeneus]] had forgotten her at the harvest sacrifices. In the hunt, Atalanta drew the first blood and was awarded the prize of the skin. She hung it in a sacred grove at [[Tegea]] as a dedication to Artemis.\n\n[[Meleager]] was a hero of Aetolia. King [[Oeneus]] had him gather heroes from all over Greece to hunt the [[Calydonian Boar]]. After the death of [[Meleager]], Artemis turned his grieving sisters, the [[Meleagrids]] into [[guineafowl]] that Artemis loved very much.\n\n=== Aura ===\nIn [[Nonnus]] ''[[Dionysiaca]]'',<ref>Aura does not appear elsewhere in surviving literature and appears to have been offered no [[Cult (religion)|cult]].</ref> [[Aura (mythology)|Aura]] was the daughter of [[Lelantos]] and [[Periboia]]. She was a virgin huntress, just like Artemis and proud of her maidenhood. One day, she claimed that the body of Artemis was too womanly and she doubted her virginity. Artemis asked [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] for help to avenge her dignity and caused the rape of Aura by [[Dionysus]]. Aura became a mad and dangerous killer. When she bore twin sons, she ate one of them while the other one, [[Iacchus]], was saved by Artemis. Iacchus later became an attendant of [[Demeter]] and the leader of [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].\n\n=== Polyphonte ===\n\n[[Polyphonte]] was a young woman who fled home preferring the idea of a virginal life with Artemis to the conventional life of marriage and children favoured by Aphrodite. As a punishment Aphrodite cursed her, causing her to have children by a bear. The resulting offspring, Agrius and Oreius, were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus. Ultimately the entire family were transformed into birds and more specifically ill portents for mankind.<ref>[[Antoninus Liberalis]], Metamorphoses, 21</ref>\n\n=== Trojan War ===\nArtemis may have been represented as a supporter of Troy because her brother [[Apollo]] was the patron god of the city and she herself was widely worshipped in western Anatolia in historical times. In the ''[[Iliad]]''<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'' 21.470 ff).</ref> she came to blows with Hera, when the divine allies of the Greeks and Trojans engaged each other in conflict. Hera struck Artemis on the ears with her own quiver, causing the arrows to fall out. As Artemis fled crying to Zeus, Leto gathered up the bow and arrows.\n\nArtemis played quite a large part in this war. Like her mother and brother, who was widely worshipped at Troy, Artemis took the side of the Trojans. At the Greek's journey to Troy, Artemis becalmed the sea and stopped the journey until an oracle came and said they could win the goddess' heart by sacrificing [[Iphigenia]], [[Agamemnon]]'s daughter. Agamemnon once promised the goddess he would sacrifice the dearest thing to him, which was Iphigenia, but broke that promise. Other sources{{which|date=November 2010}} said he boasted about his hunting ability and provoked the goddess' anger. Artemis saved Iphigenia because of her bravery. In some versions of the myth,{{which|date=November 2010}} Artemis made Iphigenia her attendant or turned her into [[Hecate]], goddess of night, witchcraft, and the underworld.\n\n[[Aeneas]] was helped by Artemis, Leto, and Apollo. Apollo found him wounded by Diomedes and lifted him to heaven. There, the three of them secretly healed him in a great chamber.\n\n== Worship ==\n[[File:Jerash Temple of Artemis.jpg|thumb|''Roman Temple of Artemis'' in [[Jerash, Jordan]], built during the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]].]]\n\n{{Main|Brauronia}}\n\nArtemis, the goddess of forests and hills, was worshipped throughout [[ancient Greece]].<ref>\u201c. . . a goddess universally worshipped in historical Greece, but in all likelihood pre-Hellenic.\u201d Hammond, ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 126.</ref> Her best known [[Cult (religious practice)|cults]] were on the island of [[Delos]]\n(her birthplace), in Attica at [[Brauron]] and Mounikhia (near [[Piraeus]]), and in [[Sparta]]. She was often depicted in paintings and statues in a forest setting, carrying a bow and arrows and accompanied by a deer.\n\nThe ancient Spartans used to sacrifice to her as one of their patron goddesses before starting a new [[military campaign]].\n\n[[Athenian festivals]] in honor of Artemis included [[Elaphebolia]], [[Mounikhia]], Kharisteria, and [[Brauronia]]. The festival of [[Artemis Orthia]] was observed in [[Sparta]].\n\nPre-pubescent and adolescent Athenian girls were sent to the [[sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron]] to serve the Goddess for one year. During this time, the girls were known as ''arktoi'', or little she-bears. A myth explaining this servitude states that a bear had formed the habit of regularly visiting the town of Brauron, and the people there fed it, so that, over time, the bear became tame. A girl teased the bear, and, in some versions of the myth, it killed her, while, in other versions, it clawed out her eyes. Either way, the girl's brothers killed the bear, and Artemis was enraged. She demanded that young girls \"act the bear\" at her sanctuary in atonement for the bear's death.<ref>[[Mark Golden|Golden, M.]], ''Children and Childhood in Classical Athens'' ([[Baltimore]]: [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LvV0CQAAQBAJ&pg=PT84&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 84].</ref>\n\nVirginal Artemis was worshipped as a fertility/childbirth goddess in some places, assimilating [[Ilithyia]], since, according to some myths, she assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin.

Artemis also assimilated [[Caryatis]] ([[Carya (goddess)|Carya]]).\n\n=== Epithets ===\n[[File:Artemis found in Pompeii.jpg|thumb|right|Color reconstruction of a first-century AD statue of Artemis found in [[Pompeii]], reconstructed using analysis of trace pigments - imitation of Greek statues of the sixth century BC (part of [[Gods in Color]])]]\n{{Coin image box 1 double\n| header =\n| image = File:Amfipolis+.jpg\n| caption_left = '''[[Obverse and reverse|O:]]''' bare head of [[Augustus]]\n[[Caesar (title)|\u039a\u0391\u0399\u03a3\u0391\u03a1]] / [[Son of God|\u0398\u0395\u039f\u03a5 \u03a5\u0399\u039f\u03a3]] \n| caption_right = '''[[Obverse and reverse|R:]]''' Artemis Tauropolos riding [[bull]]\n[[Amphipolis|AM\u03a6\u0399\u03a0O\u039bE\u0399\u03a4\u03a9\u039d]]\n| width = 400\n| footer = [[bronze]] [[coin]] struck by [[Augustus]] in [[Amphipolis]] 31 - 27 BC; ref.: RPC 1626\n| position = right| margin = 4\n}}\n\nAs '''Aeginaea''', she was worshipped in [[Sparta]]; the name means either huntress of [[chamois]], or the wielder of the javelin ({{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f30\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03b1}}).<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], iii. 14. \u00a7&nbsp;2.</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Schmitz |first=Leonhard |author-link =  |contribution=Aeginaea |editor-last=Smith | editor-first=William |title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |page=26 |publisher= |place=Boston |year=1867 |contribution-url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0035.html |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref>\nAlso in Sparta, Artemis ''Lygodesma'' was worshipped.

He was a grandson of the Emperors [[Moctezuma I]] and [[Itzcoatl]]. He was a descendant of the king [[Cuauhtototzin]].\n\nHe was a successor of Moctezuma and his brothers were Emperors [[Tizoc]] and [[Ahuitzotl]] and his sister was the Queen [[Chalchiuhnenetzin]]. He was an uncle of the Emperor [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]] and father of Emperors [[Moctezuma II]] and [[Cuitl\u00e1huac]].\n\n===Rise to power===\nDuring his youth, his military prowess gained him the favor influential figures such as [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]] and [[Tlacaelel I]], and thus, upon the death of [[Moctezuma I]] in 1469, he was chosen to ascend to the throne, much to the displeasure of his two older brothers, [[Tizoc]] and [[Ahuitzotl]].\n\nIt is also important that the [[Aztec calendar stone|Great Sun Stone]], also known as the Aztec Calendar, was carved under his leadership. In the year 1475 there was a major earthquake that destroyed many homes in Tenochtitl\u00e1n.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://staging.doaks.org/research/publications/doaks-online-publications/palaces-of-the-ancient-new-world/isbn-0-88402-300-1.pdf#page=16 |title=Palaces of the Ancient New World |last=Evans |first=Susan Toby |last2=Pillsbury |first2=Joanne |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection |year=1998 |isbn=0-88402-300-1 |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=16}}</ref>\n\n===Military actions and death===\nUsing as a pretext the insulting behavior of a few Tlatelolcan citizens, Axayacatl invaded his neighbor, killed its ruler, [[Moquihuix]], and replaced him with a military governor.

Albinism is associated with a number of vision defects, such as [[photophobia]], [[nystagmus]], and [[amblyopia]]. Lack of skin pigmentation makes for more susceptibility to sunburn and skin cancers. In rare cases such as [[Ch\u00e9diak\u2013Higashi syndrome]], albinism may be associated with deficiencies in the transportation of melanin granules.

The skin that would have been exposed upon general body hair loss in these early hominins would have most likely been non-pigmented, reflecting the pale skin underlying the hair of our chimpanzee relatives.

The positive advantage, however, would have had to be strong enough so as to produce a significantly higher reproductive fitness in those who produced more melanin. The cause of a selective pressure strong enough to cause this shift is an area of much debate.

One study found that 89% of people diagnosed with albinism are between 0 and 30 years of age, while the other found that 77% of albinos were under the age of 20.<ref name=\"biomedcentral.com\" />\n\n==Diagnosis==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2007}}\n[[Genetic testing]] can confirm albinism and what variety it is, but offers no medical benefits except in the cases of non-OCA disorders that cause albinism ''along with'' other medical problems which may be treatable. There is no 'cure' for Albinism.   The ''symptoms'' of albinism can be assisted by various methods.\n\n==Management==\nSince there is no cure for albinism, it is managed through lifestyle adjustments. People with albinism need to take care not to get sunburnt and should have regular healthy skin checks by a dermatologist.\n\nFor the most part, treatment of the eye conditions consists of visual rehabilitation. Surgery is possible on the [[Extraocular muscles|extra-ocular muscles]] to decrease [[strabismus]].<ref name=\"Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis\" /> [[Nystagmus]]-damping surgery can also be performed, to reduce the \"shaking\" of the eyes back and forth.<ref name=\"Surgical management of nystagmus\">{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=J. |title=Surgical management of nystagmus |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=238\u201341 |date=May 2002 |pmid=11983764 |pmc=1279676 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.5.238}}</ref> The effectiveness of all these procedures varies greatly and depends on individual circumstances.\n\n[[Glasses]], low vision aids, [[large-print]] materials, and bright angled reading lights can help individuals with albinism.

Diab, at the age of six, had his first shot at fame when he sang the [[Egypt|Egyptian National Anthem]] \"[[Bilady, Bilady, Bilady]]\" at the annual 23 July Festival in Port Said in the presence of the late [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. As a result, he was rewarded with a guitar from the governor of Port Said, and began to become recognised nationally.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Diab graduated with a bachelor's degree in Arabic Music from the Cairo Academy of Arts in 1986.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ecelebrityfacts.com/amr-diab-biography|title=Amr Diab Biography|last=eCelebrityFacts|work=eCelebrityFacts.com|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} \nAmr Diab Is married to Zeina Ashour Who is From Saudi Arabia And has 4 child the first one daughter Nour from first marriage to actress Shereen reda and one son Abdallah and two daughters Kinzy and Jana from marriage with Zeina Ashour\n\n==Music career==\nDiab released his first album entitled ''Ya Tareeq'' in 1983.

In the group was an emcee named [[Ya Kid K]] from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] who later led the group into international fame with hits like \"Pump up the Jam\" and \"Shake That Body\". In 1990, she also joined the group Hi-Tek 3 who were heard on the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' movie [[soundtrack]]. \n\nHowever, the first major pop rapper from Belgium was [[Benny B]], who had a very mainstream and commercial sound.  According to the European Music Office's report on ''Music in Europe'', this was the first of many pop acts that helped inspire a backlash and the creation of an underground hip hop scene.\n\nAlso in the late 1980s in the [[Wallonia|Walloon south]] of the country, French speaking/rapping [[Starflam]] was the biggest name in hip hop.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Morgan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/dec/04/baloji-rapper-congo-sorcerer-interview |title=Baloji: 'I want to make music that is very African and very modern' &#124; Music &#124; The Observer |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}</ref> In the [[Flanders|Flemish]] north Dutch speaking/rapping groups like [['t Hof van Commerce]], Krapoel In Axe, St Andries MC's, and ABN were popular, rapping in their regional [[dialect]]s. \nTo find out more about today's Belgian hip hop scene, check out [http://www.belgianhiphop.be/ The Belgian Hip Hop Channel] and [http://www.vlaamserap.be/ vlaamserap.be]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{hiphop}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Belgian Hip Hop}}\n[[Category:Belgian hip hop|*]]", "sha1": "gban5ukunbuxbp9n1nn5wmnl7xo9c3m"}}, {"title": "Dutch hip hop", "ns": "0", "id": "2917", "revision": {"id": "859108726", "parentid": "857186675", "timestamp": "2018-09-11T19:34:33Z", "contributor": {"ip": "213.46.39.234"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2015}}\n{{Review|date=January 2008}}\n'''Dutch hip hop''' or '''Nederhop''', is [[hip hop music]] created by musicians in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1980s===\nBetween 1980 and 1985 a few Dutch Hip Hop records had already been released, but in 1986 Dutch rap duo [[MC Miker G & DJ Sven]] (Lucien Witteveen and Sven van Veen) had a major top 10 hit (often #1) across Europe with their \"Holiday Rap\", which sampled [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna's]] \"Holiday\". That same year Dutch rapper [[Extince]] released his first record: Rap Around The Clock. Another 1980s group was the [[Osdorp Posse]], who first started to record tracks in Dutch. But there is disagreement about who started rapping in Dutch between Blonnie B, Alex and the CityCrew, Dynamic Rockers, Def Rhymes and Osdorp Posse.\n\nNotable in the late 1980s were All Star Fresh of [[King Bee (hip hop group)|King Bee]] topping charts with: \"Back by Dope Demand\" in early 1990 and Rudeboy of [[Urban Dance Squad]] who, at the time, were arguably more widely known in New York City than the Netherlands. DJ and Producer All Star Fresh Started as a Pro in 1979. After winning the Dutch Mixing Championships (DMC) in 1988, he was invited for The World Mix Championships in the London Royal Hall and won third place in a fierce competition. He was invited by Dave Funkenklein to enter the lions hole in New York. He made history in the Big Apple of Hiphop by being the first non -American to fly into the finals of The World Supremacy Battle of DJs. He gained the highly respected second place of this prestigious DJ contest). The impression that he made that year, resulted in many invitations to perform with world known artists like Public Enemy, Stetsasonic, Ice T and Ultra Magnetic MCs.\n\nAll Star Fresh. As performer and producer he is very well known as KING BEE. With his second floor filler Back By Dope Demand he scored one of the biggest hiphop hits. In the Netherlands it resulted in a Top 3 position. Best Dance Product by The Edison Awards in the Netherlands. (The Edison Awards is an award by the Dutch Music Industry.) This also meant that with this title, he was the first black artist to win this award in the Netherlands. After that he appeared as supporting act for Madonnas show in the Netherlands. All Star Fresh kept entering the dance floors. The last titles mentioned were also worldwide hits, selling over 2.4&nbsp;million copies. He didn't only work within projects like King Bee or Capella, but also was featuring famous production teams like Snap (I Got the Power). This teamwork resulted in the single Lets Get Busy (Clubland Quarts feat Snap {{sic|introductin}} King Bee). This record ended up No 01 in the Billboard Dance Charts (United States). Other productions were Deepzone \"It's Gonna Be All right\", a straight up club anthem even until today. Kellee- my love, Ty Holden- you're my Inspiration and His Royal Freshness- They don't understand are a couple of other productions in this line.\n\nUrban Dance Squad was a Dutch rap rock band formed after what was originally intended as a one-time jam-session at a festival in Utrecht on 20 December 1986[1]. Band members were rapper Rudeboy Remington (Patrick Tilon), guitarist Tres Manos (Ren\u00e9 van Barneveld), bassist Sil (Silvano Matadin), drummer Magic Stick (Michel Schoots) and DJ DNA (DoNotAsk) (Arjen de Vreede). The band's music is described as a blend of genres, including hard rock, funk, soul, hip hop, reggae, jazz and ska and is often compared to that of Rage Against the Machine, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone. They are widely known for their hit single \"Deeper Shade of Soul\", which charted at number 21 in the United States on Billboard Hot 100. It is a well known fact that Rage Against the Machine was inspired by the Urban Dance Squad.\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1992, Osdorp Posse released their debut album ''Osdorp Stijl'', which was the first-ever hip hop in Dutch language<ref>{{cite web|last1=Keys|first1=Kelsea|title=Osdorp Posse's Biography|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Osdorp+Posse/+wiki|website=last.fm|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>.They started out translating [[N.W.A]] songs to [[Dutch language|Dutch]], though later wrote their own rhymes in Dutch. Their beats, created by producer Seda on Amiga 500 with Protracker, have a familiar heavy sound and are similar to U.S. old-school hip hop. Frontman Def-P describes it as [[hardcore rap]]. In the 17 years of de Osdorp Posse's existence, the crew hasn't changed their style and are still making hardcore hip hop.\n\nAfter the first Osdorp Posse demo cassette they toured around the Netherlands. In Deventer they found the first followers and the first Dutch language hip hop scene. The first hip hop groups after Osdorp Posse were Zuid-Oost Posse and Maasstraat Mannen. These groups did concerts all over the Netherlands. Maasstraat became famous as the first group combining reggae with Dutch lyrics, inspiring acts like Postmen, for example.\n\nAnother Dutch-language rapper is Extince, who in 1995 took Nederhop to a new commercial level. With two of his singles ''Spraakwater'' and ''Kaal of Kammen'' being major hits in the mid-1990s, Extince was the first Dutch rapper making the MegaCharts. Other notable acts include Ali B (who has been featured on other artists' tracks, most significantly with Marco Borsato on the song \"Wat zou je doen?\" for the charity [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] who achieved solo success with \"Leipe mocro flavour\". Together with his cousin Yes-R he made an international remix of \"[[Ghetto (Akon song)|Ghetto]]\" together with Akon.; the duo Lange Frans & Baas B with their patriotic but introspective \"[[Het land van (song)|Het Land Van]]\"; and [[Yes-R]]. Other notable groups are \"Opgezwolle\" (consisting of rapper Sticky Steez, rapper Phreaco Rico and DJ Delic) and Brainpower.\n\nThere were two styles dominating the Dutch hip hop landscape: [[Extince]], known for his easy flows, catchy songs and funky tunes, while hardcore performers like [[Westklan]] and [[Osdorp Posse]] found their own niche group of fans.\n\nIn the mid-1990s [[The Postmen]] were topping the charts with their rap/[[reggae]] mix.\n\n===2000s===\nIn the early 2000s the MC fronted band [[Relax (band)|Relax]] got much airplay, as did de Spookrijders.\n\nA combination of these two styles gave birth to de Spookrijders, a three-man hip-hop group founded in 1996. With MCs Stefan and Clyde rapping about their personal lives and life in Amsterdam as a black man, de Spookrijders even gained respect from non-hip-hop musicians and fans. Most people admired the work of producer/DJ Cliff 'the Jazz' Nille after releasing Spookrijders debut album ''De Echte Shit''. In 1999 de Spookrijders hit the charts twice with the hits \"Klokkenluiders\" and \"Ik ben de man.\" Both these songs appeared on the second album, ''Klokkenluiders van Amsterdam''. After some personal arguments among the three crewmembers, de Spookrijders split up in 2003, after releasing their and final third album ''Hee... Spookies!!''\n\nDef Rhymz, Spookrijders & Brainpower really helped develop the game. Def Rhymz & Brainpower dropped multiple hit records. With at least 8 Top 100 album/EP projects Brainpower is one of the most successful Dutch MC's ever and remains a prolific bilingual lyricist (in Dutch & in English) to this day.\n\n[[Opgezwolle]], a group from [[Zwolle]]'s latest album, ''[[Eigen Wereld]]'' (Own World) appeared in the 'Album Top 100' at number 4; the highest notation of a Dutch rap album ever. [[Opgezwolle]] split up on 30 November 2007. Members Rico & Sticks formed a new group, [[Fakkelbrigade]] with [[MC Typhoon]], [[Mick 2dope Murray]], [[MC James]] and beatmaker [[A.R.T. (musician)|ART]]. In 2009, they released the album ''[[Colucci Era]]''.\n\nIn the mid-2000s [[Cilvaringz]], [[Ali B]] and [[Raymzter]] have commercially been successful and [[Lange Frans & Baas B]] have had multiple No. 1 hits. In 2005, [[De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig]] (\"Kids These Days\") were successful with \"[[Watskeburt]]?!\" (\"Wuzhappenin?!\").\n\nRapper [[Jawat]] won the \"[[Grote Prijs van Nederland]]\" 2006.\n\nAnother Dutch hip-hop duo are [[Pete Philly and Perquisite]] who are already well known in the Netherlands, Germany, and even in Japan.\n\nA famous Dutch rapper outside the Netherlands is Salah Edin. His album [[Nederlands Grootste Nachtmerrie]] (Biggest Nightmare of the Netherlands) won Best Album Award in 2007 and was fully produced by Dr. Dre's right-hand man Focus. He also shot three of the most expensive music videos ever in the history of Dutch Hip Hop and through a management deal with [[Cilvaringz]], performed in 34 countries worldwide.\n\n===2010s===\nThe year 2010 is considered an important year for Dutch hip-hop, with many albums and mixtapes released from the biggest Dutch rappers.\n\nAlso [[Mc Battles]] are having a large amount of popularity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nNederhop is growing fast. So are the recently Nederhop blogs as Nederhopofficial.nl and Puna.nl.\n\nIn 2016, album ''[[WOP!]]'' by [[Lil' Kleine]] was the first hip-hop album to reacher number 1 on the [[Album Top 100]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://3voor12.vpro.nl/artikelen/overzicht/2016/Februari/lil-kleine-wop-nummer-1-album-single-top-100.html|title=Lil' Kleine breekt records: heel WOP in de Single Top 100 \u2013 stories|work=[[3VOOR12]]|access-date=6 November 2017|language=nl-NL}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nu.nl/muziek/4217564/lil-kleine-breekt-meerdere-records-in-nederlandse-hitlijsten.html|title=Lil' Kleine breekt meerdere records in Nederlandse hitlijsten|work=[[NU.nl]]|access-date=6 November 2017|language=nl}}</ref>\n\n===Conflicts===\nThe Dutch hip-hop scene also saw many conflicts between rappers, followed by diss tracks. The following were among the biggest Dutch feuds in hip-hop:\n\n[Osdorp Posse] Vs [Extince], [Brain Power] Vs [Extince], [[T.H.C]] . Vs [[Negativ]], [[Kempi]] Vs [[Nino (rapper)|Nino]], [[Brainpower]] Vs [[Extince]], Yukkie B Vs Negativ, T.H.C. Vs Lexxxus, Baas B Vs Kimo, Kempi Vs Mini, Kempi Vs Bloedserieus, Heist Rockah Vs Negativ, and Regga Vs Lexxxus.\n\nThe feud between T.H.C. and Lexxxus resulted in a fistfight on a hip-hop event, when T.H.C. frontman rocks got into an argument with Lexxxus and then started the fistfight. Also many Dutch rappers got shot/stabbed, wounding or killing them. Bloedserieus rapper Sane got in a fight over drugs and was fatally stabbed at Eindhoven Central Station. Kane (another rapper of Bloedserieus and the twinbrother of Sane) made a song about this called \"Jonko voor Sane\" (Joint for Sane). Amsterdam rappers Lexxxus, Flex of T.H.C. and Mr. Probz got shot.\n\n== Genres in Dutch hip hop ==\n\n===Gangsta===\nDutch gangsta hip hop is currently a large scene together with underground hip-hop. Among the most notable groups are [[Tuindorp Hustler Click|THC]], [[Heinek'n]], [[Keizer (rapper)|Keizer]], [[Kempi]], Steen, Hef, Crooks, [[Adonis (rapper)|Adonis]] and [[Negativ]]. The rhythms are influenced by the American rap scene, and the [[lyrics]] are often about crime, [[drugs]], money, women and other criminal things.\nOften coming from Dutch [[ghetto]]s, lyrics often include themes occurring in these areas.\nDutch gangsta hip hop mostly comes from the five largest  cities: [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Den Haag]], [[Utrecht]] and [[Eindhoven]].\n\n===Commercial success===\nThe commercial success of Dutch hip hop is largely made by [[Brainpower]], [[Yes-R]], [[Ali B]], [[Lange Frans & Baas B]] and [[Extince]]. For a large part of the Dutch hip hop community Yes-R, Ali B and Lange Frans & Baas B are sometimes considered fake because they do a lot of work for children TV stations. [[Brainpower]] and [[Extince]] however both enjoy a great respect for bringing up hip hop in their native [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Other commercial rappers are [[De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig]], and one of the more popular artists in the Netherlands, Partysquad or The Partysquad. They are a 2-man group, having had success with hits such as \"Stuk\" (Broken), and \"Dat is Die Shit\" (That's the shit), with other popular songs in the background such as \"Non Stop\" ft. [[Brainpower]], \"We Gaan Los\" (we're going crazy {because of highness or drunkenness}) with Kempi, and \"Wat Wil Je Doen\" (What do you want to do?).\n\n===Dutch oldskool===\nThe Dutch [[Old school hip hop|oldskool]] exists out of three primary artists, [[LTH (musician)|LTH]], [[Osdorp Posse]], [[Extince]], [[Sugacane]] and [[Duvelduvel]]. [[Osdorp Posse]] make to what they themselves call hardcore rap and use beats that have much in common with [[N.W.A]]. Their lyrics are about racism, prostitution (not always negatively), police and other social subjects. Extince uses very different, more funky kind of beats than Osdorp Posse and uses a completely different rapstyle. Duvelduvel is known as a conceptual hip hop group.\n\n==Notable artists==\nThe Dutch hip hop scene is roughly divided by the Netherlands' (mostly) larger cities.\n* [[Alkmaar]] \u2013 [[Boef]], [[The Opposites]], Rambo\n* [[Almere]] \u2013 [[Ali B]], [[Josylvio]], [[Raymzter]], [[MC DRT]], \n* [[Amsterdam]] \u2013 [[Sevn Alias]] SMIB, [[Brainpower]], [[Osdorp Posse]], [[De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig]] (Incl.

Born to Cuban parents in [[France]], Nin was the daughter of composer [[Joaqu\u00edn Nin]] and Rosa Culmell, a classically trained singer. Nin spent her early years in  [[Spain]] and [[Cuba]], about sixteen years in Paris (1924\u20131940), and the remaining half of her life in the [[United States]], where she became an established author.\n\nBeginning at age eleven, Nin wrote [[diary|journal]]s prolifically for six decades and even up until her death. Her journals, many of which were published during her lifetime, detail her private thoughts and personal relationships, as well as her sexually abusive and incestuous relationship with her father.

Her  parents separated when she was two; her mother then moved Ana\u00efs and her two brothers, Thorvald Nin and [[Joaqu\u00edn Nin-Culmell]], to [[Barcelona]], and then to [[New York City]], where she attended high school. Nin would drop out of high school in 1919 at age sixteen,{{sfn|Nin|DuBow|1994|p=xxi}} and according to her diaries, ''Volume One, 1931\u20131934'', later began working as an artist's model. After being in the United States for several years, Nin had forgotten how to speak Spanish, but retained her French and became fluent in English.{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=183}}\n\nOn March 3, 1923, in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], Nin married her first husband, [[Hugh Parker Guiler]] (1898\u20131985), a banker and artist, later known as \"Ian Hugo\" when he became a maker of [[experimental film]]s in the late 1940s. The couple moved to Paris the following year, where Guiler pursued his [[banking]] career and Nin began to pursue her interest in writing; in her diaries she also mentions having trained as a [[flamenco]] dancer in Paris in the mid-to-late 1920s with [[Francisco Miralles Arnau]]. Her first published work was a critical evaluation of [[D. H. Lawrence]] called ''[[D. H.

Rank, she observes, helped her move back and forth between what she could verbalize in her journals and what remained unarticulated. She discovered the quality and depth of her feelings in the wordless transitions between what she could say and what she could not say.  \"As he talked, I thought of my difficulties with writing, my struggles to articulate feelings not easily expressed. Of my struggles to find a language for intuition, feeling, instincts which are, in themselves, elusive, subtle, and wordless.\"{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=276}}\n\nIn the late summer of 1939, when residents from overseas were urged to leave France due to the approaching [[Second World War|war]], Nin left Paris and returned to New York City with her husband. (Guiler was, according to his own wishes, all but edited out of the diaries published during Nin's lifetime; his role in her life is therefore difficult to gauge.)<ref>\"Several persons, when faced with the question of whether they wanted to remain in the diary 'as is' ... chose to be deleted altogether from the manuscript (including her husband and some members of her family).\" ''The Diary of Ana\u00efs Nin'', ed. by Gunther Stuhlmann.

She actually began to act as a psychoanalyst herself, seeing patients in the room next to Rank's, and having sex with her patients on the psychoanalytic couch.{{sfn|Nin|1967|pages=17\u201325}} She quit after several months, however, stating: \"I found that I wasn't good because I wasn't objective. I was haunted by my patients.

The published journals, which span several decades from 1933 onward, provide a deeply explorative insight into her personal life and relationships. Nin was acquainted, often quite intimately, with a number of prominent authors, artists, [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]], and other figures, and wrote of them often, especially [[Otto Rank]]. Moreover, as a female author describing a primarily masculine constellation of celebrities, Nin's journals have acquired importance as a counterbalancing perspective.\n\nIn the third volume of her unexpurgated journal, ''Incest'', she wrote about her father candidly and graphically (207\u201315), detailing his sexual abuse of her at age nine.<ref>{{cite web|work=A Psychotherapist in Paris|url=https://www.cherrychapman.com/2012/09/07/anais-nin-narcissism-and-deception/|title=Anais Nin & Narcissim and Deception|date=September 7, 2012|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\nPreviously unpublished works are coming to light in ''A Caf\u00e9 in Space, the Ana\u00efs Nin Literary Journal'', which includes \"Ana\u00efs Nin and Joaqu\u00edn Nin y Castellanos: Prelude to a Symphony\u2014Letters between a father and daughter.\"\n\nSo far sixteen volumes of her journals have been published.  All but the last five of her adult journals are in expurgated form.\n\n===Erotic writings===\nNin is hailed by many critics as one of the finest writers of [[Women's erotica|female erotica]]. She was one of the first women known to explore fully the realm of [[erotic literature|erotic writing]], and certainly the first prominent woman in the modern West known to write erotica. Before her, erotica acknowledged to be written by women was rare, with a few notable exceptions, such as the work of [[Kate Chopin]]. Nin often cited authors [[Djuna Barnes]] and D. H. Lawrence as inspirations, and she states in ''Volume One'' of her diaries that she drew inspiration from [[Marcel Proust]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=15}} [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=45}} [[Jean Cocteau]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|pages=60, 109}} [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=60}} and [[Arthur Rimbaud]].{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=29, 40}}\n\nAccording to ''Volume One'' of her diaries, ''1931\u20131934'', published in 1966, Nin first came across erotica when she returned to Paris with her husband, mother and two brothers in her late teens. They rented the apartment of an American man who was away for the summer, and Nin came across a number of French paperbacks: \"One by one, I read these books, which were completely new to me.  I had never read erotic literature in America\u2026 They overwhelmed me.  I was innocent before I read them, but by the time I had read them all, there was nothing I did not know about sexual exploits\u2026 I had my degree in erotic lore.\"{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=96}}\n\nFaced with a desperate need for money, Nin, Henry Miller and some of their friends began in the 1940s to write erotic and pornographic narratives for an anonymous \"collector\" for a dollar a page, somewhat as a joke.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gertzman, Jay A.|page=344|title=Bookleggers and Smuthounds: The Trade in Erotica, 1920-1940|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2011|edition=Reprint|isbn=978-0-812-20585-5}}</ref> (It is not clear whether Miller actually wrote these stories or merely allowed his name to be used.<ref>[[No\u00ebl Riley Fitch]], ''Ana\u00efs: The Erotic Life of Ana\u00efs Nin'' (Boston: [[Little, Brown and Company]], 1993) {{ISBN|0-316-28428-9}}</ref>)  Nin considered the characters in her erotica to be extreme caricatures and never intended the work to be published, but changed her mind in the early 1970s and allowed them to be published as ''[[Delta of Venus]]''<ref>{{cite book|last=  Kowaleski-Wallace |first=Elizabeth|title= Encyclopedia of Feminist Literary Theory|publisher= [[Taylor & Francis]]|year=1997|p=190|isbn=0-8153-0824-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Andrew|last= Gibson|title=Postmodernity, Ethics and the Novel: From Leavis to Levinas|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=0-415-19895-X|p=177}}</ref> and ''[[Little Birds]]''.

Her passionate love affair and friendship with Miller strongly influenced her both sexually and as an author. Claims that Nin was [[bisexual]] were given added circulation by the [[Philip Kaufman]] film ''[[Henry & June]]'' about [[Henry Miller]] and his second wife [[June Miller]]. The first unexpurgated portion of Nin's journal to be published, ''[[Henry and June]]'', makes it clear that Nin was stirred by June to the point of saying (paraphrasing), \"I have become June,\" though it is unclear whether she consummated her feelings for her sexually. To both Ana\u00efs and Henry, June was a femme fatale\u2014irresistible, cunning, erotic. Nin gave June money, jewelry, clothes, often leaving herself broke.\n\n===Novels and other publications===\nIn addition to her journals and collections of erotica, Nin wrote several novels, which were frequently associated by critics with [[Surrealism#Surrealist literature|surrealism]].<ref name=eb>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anais-Nin|title=Ana\u00efs Nin|author= The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|work= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=October 6, 2017}}</ref> Her first book of fiction, ''[[House of Incest]]'' (1936), contains heavily veiled allusions to a brief sexual relationship Nin had with her father in 1933: While visiting her estranged father in France, the then-thirty-year-old Nin had a brief incestual sexual relationship with him.<ref name=father>{{cite journal|publisher=Taylor & Francis Online|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14484528.2013.838732|author=Charnock, Ruth|date=September 30, 2013|title= Incest in the 1990s: Reading Ana\u00efs Nin's 'Father Story'|work=Life Writing|pages=55\u201368|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}</ref> In 1944, she published a collection of short stories titled ''[[Under a Glass Bell]]'', which were reviewed by [[Edmund Wilson]].<ref name=fraser/>\n\nNin was also the author of several works of non-fiction: Her first publication, written during her years studying psychoanalysis, was ''[[D.

Her husband Guiler is not mentioned anywhere in the published edition of the 1930s parts of her diary (Vol. 1\u20132) although the opening of Vol. 1 makes it clear that she is married, and the introduction suggests her husband refused to be included in the published diaries. The diaries edited by her second husband, after her death, tell that her union with Henry Miller was very passionate and physical, and that she believed that it was a pregnancy by him that she aborted in 1934.\n\nIn 1947, at the age of 44, she met former actor [[Rupert Pole]] in a Manhattan elevator on her way to a party.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/magazine/31pole.t.html?_r=1|work=New York Times|title=The Lover Who Always Stays|date=2006-12-31|accessdate=2011-02-16|author=Corbett, Sara}}</ref><ref name=\"pole\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5591676|work=National Public Radio (NPR)|title=Anais Nin Husband, Rupert Pole, Dies in L.A.|date=July 29, 2006|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> The two ended up dating and traveled to California together; Pole was sixteen years her junior.

There were several attempts from Microsoft to simultaneously log into their own and AIM's protocol servers. AOL were not happy about this and started blocking MSN Messenger from being able to access AIM.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/21/5635488/msn-messenger-vs-aol-aim-chat-wars|title=Inside Microsoft's '90s chat war with AOL|first=Tom|last=Warren|date=April 21, 2014|work=theverge.com|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nplusonemag.com/issue-19/essays/chat-wars/|title=Chat Wars|date=March 25, 2014|work=nplusonemag.com|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAIM went officially mobile in early 2008 when the application was released for [[Windows Mobile]] devices and allowed for all devices to send IMs via SMS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/aims-windows-mobile-chat-app-nails-a-bullseye/|title=AIM's Windows Mobile chat app nails a bullseye - The Download Blog - CNET Download.com|work=cnet.com|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}</ref> However AIM could already be used on various devices beforehand with third-party applications, and as early as 2002 on a [[Danger Hiptop|Sidekick]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bgr.com/2007/10/02/mobile-im-clients-sidekick-helio-ocean-blackberry-iphone-and-more/|title=Mobile IM clients: Sidekick, Helio Ocean, BlackBerry, iPhone, and more|first=Jonathan S.|last=Geller|date=October 2, 2007|work=bgr.com|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter 2012, stand-alone official AIM client software includes advertisements and was available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Windows Mobile]], [[Classic Mac OS]], [[macOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[BlackBerry OS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://products.aim.com/products |title=Products AIM |publisher=Products AIM |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Usage decline and product sunset===\nAround 2011, AIM started to lose popularity rapidly, partly due to the quick rise of [[Gmail]] and its built-in real-name [[Google Chat]] instant messenger integration in 2011 and because many people started purely moving onto [[Short Message Service|SMS]] [[text messaging]] and later [[social networking]] websites (in particular, [[Facebook Messenger]], which was released as a standalone app the same year) for instant messaging.\n\n{{As of|June 2011}}, one source reported AOL Instant Messenger market share had collapsed to 0.73%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opswat.com/sites/default/files/OPSWAT-Market-Share-Report-June-2011.pdf|title=OPSWAT Market Share Report June 2011|publisher=opswat.com|date=|accessdate=August 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102180321/http://www.opswat.com/sites/default/files/OPSWAT-Market-Share-Report-June-2011.pdf|archive-date=January 2, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, this number only reflects installed IM applications, and not active users.

AIM's popularity in the late 1990s and the 2000s led to the \"Running Man\" becoming a familiar brand on the Internet.

Most AOL-produced versions of AIM and popular third party AIM clients use this protocol. However, AOL also created a simpler protocol called [[TOC2 protocol|TOC]] that lacks many of OSCAR's features but was sometimes used for clients that only require basic chat functionality. The TOC/TOC2 protocol specifications were made available by AOL, while OSCAR is a closed protocol that third parties have had to reverse-engineer.\n\nIn January 2008, AOL introduced experimental [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol]] (XMPP) support for AIM,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://florianjensen.com/2008/01/17/aol-adopting-xmpp-aka-jabber/|title=AOL adopting XMPP aka Jabber|date=2008-01-17|accessdate=2008-01-17|author=Florian Jensen|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120143857/http://florianjensen.com/2008/01/17/aol-adopting-xmpp-aka-jabber/|archivedate=January 20, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> allowing AIM users to communicate using the standardized, open-source XMPP.

AIM accounts are available only for people over the age of 13;  children younger than that were not permitted access to AIM.<ref name=\"6 Facts About AIM's Privacy Policy\">{{cite web|url=http://im.about.com/od/promotingimsafety/a/aim-privacy.htm|title=AIM Privacy -- Terms of Service Policy -- AIM Privacy|author=Brandon De Hoyos|work=About.com Tech|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nUnder the AIM Privacy Policy, AOL had no rights to read or monitor any private communications between users. The profile of the user had no privacy.<ref name=\"6 Facts About AIM's Privacy Policy\"/>\n\nIf public content was accessed, it could be used for online, print or broadcast advertising, etc. This was outlined in the policy and terms of service: \"... you grant AOL, its parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, assigns, agents and licensees the irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to reproduce, display, perform, distribute, adapt and promote this Content in any medium\". This allowed anything users posted to be used without a separate request for permission.<ref name=\"6 Facts About AIM's Privacy Policy\"/>\n\nThe issue of AIM's security was called into question. AOL stated that it had taken great steps to insure that personal information will not be accessed by unauthorized members, but that it cannot guarantee that that will not happen.<ref name=\"6 Facts About AIM's Privacy Policy\"/>\n\nAIM was different from other clients, such as [[Yahoo! Messenger]], in that it did not require approval from users to be added to other users' buddy lists. As a result, it was possible for users to keep other unsuspecting users on their buddy list to see when they were online, read their status and away messages, and read their profiles. There was also a Web API to display one's status and away message as a widget on one's webpage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dev.aol.com/data_sheets/WebAIM_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf |title=Integrate Your Site with AIM in 3 Easy Steps |work=AOL Developer Network |publisher=AOL Inc |page=2 |format=PDF |accessdate=August 9, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726062640/http://dev.aol.com/data_sheets/WebAIM_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Though one could block a user from communicating with them and seeing their status, this did not prevent that user from creating a new account that would not automatically be blocked and therefore able to track their status. A more conservative privacy option was to select a menu feature that only allowed communication with users on one's buddy list; however, this option also created the side-effect of blocking all users who were not on one's buddy list.\n\n==Chat robots==\nAOL and various other companies supplied robots on AIM that could receive messages and send a response based on the bot's purpose. For example, bots could help with studying, like StudyBuddy. Some were made to relate to children and teenagers, like [[Spleak]], others gave advice, and others were for more general purposes, such as [[SmarterChild]]. The more useful chat bots had features like the ability to play games, get sport scores, weather forecasts or financial stock information. Users were able to talk to automated chat bots that could respond to natural human language. They were primarily put into place as a marketing strategy and for unique advertising options.  It was used by advertisers to market products or build better consumer relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/aol-tries-out-new-im-chat-bot/|title=tries out new IM chat bot |date=2003-01-27 |accessdate=2015-10-27|publisher=[[CNET]]}}</ref>\n\nBefore the inclusions of such bots, the other bots DoorManBot and AIMOffline provided features that were provided by AOL for those who needed it. [[ZolaOnAOL]] and [[ZoeOnAOL]] were short lived bots that ultimately retired their features in favor of SmarterChild.\n\n==URI scheme==\nAOL Instant Messenger's installation process automatically installed an extra [[URI scheme]] (\"protocol\") handler into some Web browsers, so URIs beginning \"<tt>aim:</tt>\" could open a new AIM window with specified parameters. This was similar in function to the <tt>mailto:</tt> URI scheme, which created a new e-mail message using the system's default mail program. For instance, a webpage might have included a link like the following in its HTML source to open a window for sending a message to the AIM user ''notarealuser'':\n <code>&lt;a href=\"aim:goim?screenname=notarealuser\"&gt;Send Message&lt;/a&gt;</code>\n\nTo specify a message body, the <code>message</code> parameter was used, so the link location would have looked like this:\n <code>aim:goim?screenname=notarealuser&message=This+is+my+message</code>\n\nTo specify an away message, the message parameter was used, so the link location would have looked like this:\n <code>aim:goaway?message=Hello,+my+name+is+Bill</code>\nWhen placing this inside a URL link, an AIM user could click on the URL link and the away message \"Hello, my name is Bill\" would instantly become their away message.\n\nTo add a buddy, the addbuddy message was used, with the screenname parameter\n <code>aim:addbuddy?screenname=notarealuser</code>\nThis type of link was commonly found on forum profiles to easily add contacts.\n\n==Vulnerabilities==\nAIM had security weaknesses that have enabled [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]] to be created that use third-party software to perform malicious acts on users' computers.<ref name=\"fileforum.betanews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/AOL-Instant-Messenger-for-Windows/929853714/1|title=Reviews of AOL Instant Messenger for Windows|date=2011-01-08|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref> Although most were relatively harmless, such as being kicked off the AIM service, others performed potentially dangerous actions such as sending [[computer virus|viruses]]. Some of these exploits relied on [[social engineering (computer security)|social engineering]] to spread by automatically sending instant messages that contained a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] accompanied by text suggesting the receiving user click on it, an action which leads to infection (i.e. a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]]). These messages could easily be mistaken as coming from a friend and contain a link to a Web address that installed software on the user's computer to restart the cycle.\n\nUsers also have reported sudden additions of toolbars and advertisements from third parties in the newer version of AIM. Multiple complaints about the lack of control of third party involvement have caused many users to stop using the service.<ref name=\"fileforum.betanews.com\"/>\n\n==Extra features==\n\n===iPhone application===\nOn March 6, 2008, during [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iPhone SDK]] event, AOL announced that they would be releasing an AIM application for [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] users. The application is available for free from the App Store, but the company also provides a paid version, which displays no advertisements. Both are available from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]. The AIM client for [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] supports standard AIM accounts as well as [[MobileMe]] accounts.  There is also an express version of AIM accessible through the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] browser on the iPhone and iPod Touch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2008/03/06/apple-releases-iphone-sdk-demos-spore-instant-messaging/ |title=Apple Releases iPhone SDK, Demos Spore, Instant Messaging |publisher=Mac Rumors |date=2008-03-06 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, AOL launched a massive overhaul of their Instant Messaging service. Included in the update was a brand new [[iOS]] application for [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] which incorporated all the latest features. A brand new icon was used for the application, featuring the new cursive logo for AIM. The user-interface was entirely redone for the features including: a new buddy list, group messaging, in-line photos and videos, as well as improved file-sharing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2396491,00.asp/ |title=AOL Overhauls AIM, Adds New iPhone App |publisher=PC Magazine |date=2011-11-16 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref>\n\nCurrently the application is in version 5.0.5, which was updated as of March 2012. In the latest iteration, it supports more social stream features, much like Facebook and Twitter, as well as the ability to send voice messages up to 60 seconds long.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://handheld.softpedia.com/get/Chat/AIM-for-iPhone-97755.shtml/ |title=AIM for iPhone 5.0.5 |publisher=Softpedia |date=2012-03-20 |accessdate=2012-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227011258/http://handheld.softpedia.com/get/Chat/AIM-for-iPhone-97755.shtml |archivedate=2011-12-27 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===iPad application===\nOn April 3, 2010, Apple released the first generation iPad. Along with this newly released device AOL released the AIM application for iPad. It was built entirely from scratch for the new version iOS with a specialized user-interface for the device. It supports geo location, Facebook status updates and chat, Myspace, Twitter, YouTube, Foursquare and many social networking platforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macstories.net/ipad/aim-for-ipad-approved-screenshot/ |title=AIM for iPad Approved, Screenshot |publisher=MacStories |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref>\n\n===AIM Express===\nAIM Express ran in a pop-up browser window. It was intended for use by people who are unwilling or unable to install a standalone application or those at computers that lack the AIM application. AIM Express supported many of the standard features included in the stand-alone client, but did not provide advanced features like file transfer, audio chat, video conferencing, or buddy info. It was implemented in [[Adobe Flash]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.com/products/express |title=www.aim.com/products/express |publisher=Aim.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101205062532/http://www.aim.com/products/express| archivedate=December 5, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It was an upgrade to the prior AOL Quick Buddy, which was later available for older systems that cannot handle Express before being discontinued. Express and Quick Buddy were similar to [[MSN Messenger#MSN Web Messenger|MSN Web Messenger]] and [[Yahoo! Messenger#Web Messenger|Yahoo! Web Messenger]]. This web version evolved into AIM.com's web-based messenger.\n\n===AIM Pages===\n{{Main article|AIM Pages}}\nAIM Pages was released in May 2006, allowing the 63 million AIM users to create an online, dynamic profile. The buddy list serves as the basis for the AIM Page [[social networking service]]. An AIM Page is built using modules following the ModuleT [[microformat]]. AIM Pages was discontinued in late 2007.\n\n===AIM for Mac===\nAOL released an all-new AIM for the [[Macintosh]] on September 29, 2008 and the final build on December 15, 2008. The redesigned AIM for Mac is a full [[universal binary]] [[Cocoa API]] application that supports both Tiger and Leopard \u2013 [[macOS|Mac OS X]] 10.4.8 (and above) or Mac OS X 10.5.3 (and above). On October 1, 2009, AOL released AIM 2.0 for Mac.\n\n===AIM real-time IM===\nThis feature is available for AIM 7 and allows for a user to see what the other is typing as it is being done. It was developed and built with assistance from Trace Research and Development Centre at [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and [[Gallaudet University]].

Sudan published the lesser-known [[Sudan function]], then shortly afterwards and independently, in 1928, Ackermann published his function <math>\\varphi</math> (the Greek letter ''[[phi]]''). Ackermann's three-argument function, <math>\\varphi(m, n, p)</math>, is defined such that for ''p'' = 0, 1, 2, it reproduces the basic operations of [[addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]] as\n:<math>\\varphi(m, n, 0) = m+n,</math>\n:<math>\\varphi(m, n, 1) = m\\cdot n,</math>\n:<math>\\varphi(m, n, 2) = m^n,</math>\nand for ''p'' > 2 it extends these basic operations in a way that can be compared to the [[hyperoperation]]s:\n:<math>\\varphi(m, n, 3) = m\\uparrow^2 (n+1),\\,\\!</math>\n:<math>\\varphi(m, n, p) \\gtrapprox m\\uparrow^{p - 1}(n+1)\\ \\ (p \\ge 4).\\,\\!</math>\n(Aside from its historic role as a total-computable-but-not-primitive-recursive function, Ackermann's original function is seen to extend the basic arithmetic operations beyond exponentiation, although not as seamlessly as do variants of Ackermann's function that are specifically designed for that purpose\u2014such as [[Reuben Goodstein|Goodstein's]] [[hyperoperation]] sequence.)\n\nIn ''On the Infinite'', David Hilbert hypothesized that the Ackermann function was not primitive recursive, but it was Ackermann, Hilbert's personal secretary and former student, who actually proved the hypothesis in his paper ''On Hilbert's Construction of the Real Numbers''.<ref name=\"Ack\"/><ref>von Heijenoort.

However, the recursion is bounded because in each recursive application either ''m'' decreases, or ''m'' remains the same and ''n'' decreases. Each time that ''n'' reaches zero, ''m'' decreases, so ''m'' eventually reaches zero as well. (Expressed more technically, in each case the pair (''m'', ''n'') decreases in the [[lexicographic order]] on pairs, which is a [[well-order]]ing, just like the ordering of single non-negative integers; this means one cannot go down in the ordering infinitely many times in succession.) However, when ''m'' decreases there is no upper bound on how much ''n'' can increase\u2014and it will often increase greatly.\n\nThe P\u00e9ter-Ackermann function can also be expressed in terms of various other versions of the Ackermann function:\n* the indexed version of [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] (extended to integer indices \u2265 \u22122):\n::<math>A(m,n)=2\\uparrow^{m-2} (n+3) - 3.</math>\n:The part of the definition {{nowrap|1=''A''(''m'', 0) = ''A''(''m'' \u2212 1, 1)}} corresponds to <math>2\\uparrow^{m+1} 3=2\\uparrow^m 4.</math>\n\n* [[Conway chained arrow notation]]:\n::<math>A(m,n)=(2\\rightarrow(n+3)\\rightarrow(m-2))-3</math> for <math>m\\geq3</math>\n:hence\n::<math>2\\rightarrow n\\rightarrow m=A(m+2,n-3)+3</math> for <math>n>2</math>.\n:({{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}} and {{Nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}} would correspond with {{nowrap|1=''A''(''m'', \u22122) = \u22121}} and {{nowrap|1=''A''(''m'', \u22121) = 1}}, which could logically be added.)\n* Also, {{nowrap|''A''(''m'', ''n'')}} can be expressed as {{nowrap|2[''m''](''n'' \u2212 3) \u2212 3}}, for {{nowrap|''m'' > 1}}.{{definition needed|notation|date=September 2018}}\n\nFor small values of ''m'' like 1, 2, or 3, the Ackermann function grows relatively slowly with respect to ''n'' (at most [[exponential growth|exponentially]]). For {{nowrap|''m'' \u2265 4}}, however, it grows much more quickly; even {{nowrap|''A''(4, 2)}} is about 2{{e|19728}}, and the decimal expansion of {{nowrap|''A''(4, 3)}} is very large by any typical measure.\n\nOne interesting aspect of the Ackermann function is that the only arithmetic operations it ever uses are addition and subtraction of 1. Its properties come solely from the power of unlimited recursion. This also implies that its running time is at least proportional to its output, and so is also extremely huge. In actuality, for most cases the running time is far larger than the output; see below.\n\nA single-argument version {{nowrap|1=''f''(''n'') = ''A''(''n'', ''n'')}} that increases both ''m'' and ''n'' at the same time dwarfs every primitive recursive function, including very fast-growing functions such as the [[exponential function]], the factorial function, multi- and [[superfactorial]] functions, and even functions defined using Knuth's up-arrow notation (except when the indexed up-arrow is used). It can be seen that ''f''(''n'') is roughly comparable to ''f''<sub>''\u03c9''</sub>(''n'') in the [[fast-growing hierarchy]]. This extreme growth can be exploited to show that ''f'', which is obviously computable on a machine with infinite memory such as a [[Turing machine]] and so is a [[computable function]], grows faster than any primitive recursive function and is therefore not primitive recursive.\n\nIn a category with [[Exponential object|exponentials]], using the isomorphism <math>((X \\times Y) \\rightarrow Z) \\cong (X \\rightarrow (Y \\rightarrow Z))</math> (in computer science, this is called [[currying]]), the Ackermann function may be defined via primitive recursion over higher-order functionals as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\n\\operatorname{Ack}(0) & = & \\operatorname{S} \\\\\n\\operatorname{Ack}(m+1) & = & \\operatorname{Iter}(\\operatorname{Ack}(m))\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nwhere {{math|S(''n'') {{=}} ''n'' + 1}} is the usual [[successor function]] and Iter denotes the [[functional power]] operator, defined by primitive recursion as well:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\n\\operatorname{Iter}(f)(0) & = & f(1) \\\\\n\\operatorname{Iter}(f)(n+1) & = & f(\\operatorname{Iter}(f)(n)).\n\\end{array}\n</math>\nThe function <math>\\mathrm{Ack}</math> defined in this way agrees with the Ackermann function <math>A</math> defined above: <math>\\mathrm{Ack}(m)(n)=A(m,n)</math>.\n\n==Example expansions==\nTo see how the Ackermann function grows so quickly, it helps to expand out some simple expressions using the rules in the original definition. For example, one can fully evaluate <math>A(1, 2)</math> in the following way:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nA(1,2) & = A(0, A(1, 1)) \\\\\n& = A(0, A(0, A(1, 0))) \\\\\n& = A(0, A(0, A(0, 1))) \\\\\n& = A(0, A(0, 2)) \\\\\n& = A(0, 3) \\\\\n& = 4.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTo demonstrate how <math>A(4, 3)</math>'s computation results in many steps and in a large number:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nA(4, 3) & = A(3, A(4, 2)) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(4, 1))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(4, 0)))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(3, 1)))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(3, 0))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(2, 1))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(2, 0)))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(1, 1)))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, A(1, 0))))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, A(0, 1))))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, 2)))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, 3))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(1, 2)))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(1, 1))))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, A(1, 0)))))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, A(0, 1)))))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, 2)) )) )) ) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, 3)))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, 4)))))  \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, 5)))) \\\\\n& = \\ldots \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, 13))) \\\\\n& = \\ldots \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, 65533)) \\\\\n& = \\ldots \\\\\n& = A(3, 2^{65536} - 3) \\\\\n& = \\ldots \\\\\n& = 2^{2^{ \\overset{65536}{} }} - 3. \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== Table of values ==\nComputing the Ackermann function can be restated in terms of an infinite table. First, place the natural numbers along the top row. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left. Then use that number to look up the required number in the column given by that number and one row up. If there is no number to its left, simply look at the column headed \"1\" in the previous row. Here is a small upper-left portion of the table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Values of ''A''(''m'',&nbsp;''n'')\n|-\n! ''m''\\''n''\n! 0\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n!

This number is constructed with a technique similar to applying the Ackermann function to itself recursively.\n\nThis is a repeat of the above table, but with the values replaced by the relevant expression from the function definition to show the pattern clearly:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Values of ''A''(''m'',&nbsp;''n'')\n|-\n!

The latter is achieved by showing that <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> contains the constant functions, the successor function, the projection functions and that it is closed under the operations of function composition and primitive recursion.\n\n== Inverse ==\nSince the function {{nowrap|1=&nbsp;''f''(''n'') = ''A''(''n'', ''n'')}} considered above grows very rapidly, its [[inverse function]], ''f''{{i sup|\u22121}}, grows very slowly. This '''inverse Ackermann function''' ''f''<sup>\u22121</sup> is usually denoted by '''''\u03b1'''''. In fact, ''\u03b1''(''n'') is less than 5 for any practical input size ''n'', since {{nowrap|''A''(4, 4)}} is on the order of <math>2^{2^{2^{2^{16}}}}</math>.\n\nThis inverse appears in the time [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] of some [[algorithm]]s, such as the [[disjoint-set data structure]] and [[Bernard Chazelle|Chazelle]]'s algorithm for [[minimum spanning tree]]s. Sometimes Ackermann's original function or other variations are used in these settings, but they all grow at similarly high rates. In particular, some modified functions simplify the expression by eliminating the \u22123 and similar terms.\n\nA two-parameter variation of the inverse Ackermann function can be defined as follows, where <math>\\lfloor x \\rfloor</math> is the [[floor function]]:\n:<math>\\alpha(m,n) = \\min\\{i \\geq 1 : A(i,\\lfloor m/n \\rfloor) \\geq \\log_2 n\\}.</math>\nThis function arises in more precise analyses of the algorithms mentioned above, and gives a more refined time bound. In the disjoint-set data structure, ''m'' represents the number of operations while ''n'' represents the number of elements; in the minimum spanning tree algorithm, ''m'' represents the number of edges while ''n'' represents the number of vertices.\nSeveral slightly different definitions of {{nowrap|''\u03b1''(''m'', ''n'')}} exist; for example, {{nowrap|log<sub>2</sub> ''n''}} is sometimes replaced by ''n'', and the floor function is sometimes replaced by a [[ceiling function|ceiling]].\n\nOther studies might define an inverse function of one where m is set to a constant, such that the inverse applies to a particular row.<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=15618233 An inverse-Ackermann style lower bound for the online minimum spanning tree verification problem] November 2002</ref>\n\n==Use as benchmark==\nThe Ackermann function, due to its definition in terms of extremely deep recursion, can be used as a benchmark of a [[compiler]]'s ability to optimize recursion.

Since many served under Greek commanders and served together with Greek stradioti, the process continued.

We can say that all in some way belong to a kind of ethnic category, and often more than one. As an example, I cite the case of Zadar Arbanasi. To understand the problem of the Albanians and their ethnolinguistic (ethnic and linguistic) identity, it is necessary to go into the history of their immigration that goes back to the beginning of the 18th century., etc more precisely: the period from the first migration of 1726, the period of the second migration of 1733, and until 1754, which is considered to be the final year of their immigration. All they moved from three villages from the area of Lake Scutari \u2013 Briska, \u0160estan and Livara. Fleeing from the Ottomans, plague and other troubles, the general provider Nicola Erizzo II allowed them to settle in the area of today's Arbanasa and Zemunik. One part of the population in Zemunik became assimilated with the local population, forgetting their language. These are for example, today's Prenda, \u0160estani, \u0106urkovi\u0107i, Paleke etc. The second part of the population tried to maintain their ethnic and linguistic identity during these 280 years. On May 10, 2006 marked the 280th anniversary of their arrival in the suburb of Zadar. It was not easy, especially in the beginning, because they did not have their own church, school, etc., and is the only way to maintain their identity and language was verbally.\"</ref><ref name=\"Novik261262\">{{harvnb|Novik|2015|pp=261\u2013262}}. \"Historical Facts. Four villages with Albanian population are located in the Ukraine: Karakurt (Zhovtnevoe) set up in 1811 (Odessa region), Tyushki (Georgievka), Dzhandran (Gammovka) and Taz (Devninskoe) set up in 1862 (Zaporizh\u2019a region). Before migrating to the territory of the Russian empire, Albanians had moved from the south-east of the present day Albania into Bulgaria (Varna region) because of the Osmanli invasion (\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043d, 1914, 1926, 1933, 1948, pp. 156\u2013169). Three hundred years later they had moved from Bulgaria to the Russian empire on account of Turkish-Russian opposition in the Balkan Peninsula. Ethnic Albanians also live in Moldova, Odessa and St. Petersburg. Present Day Situation. Nowadays, in the Ukraine and Russia there are an estimated 5000 ethnic Albanians. They live mainly in villages situated in the Odessa and Zaporizh\u2019a regions. The language and many elements of traditional culture are still preserved and maintained in four Albanian villages (\u0411\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430, 2000, pp. 239\u2013255; \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430, 2000, pp. 40\u201353). From the ethnolinguistic and linguistic point of view these Albanian villages are of particular interest and value since they are excellent examples of a \"melting pot\" (\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430, 1995, 1999). Bulgarians and Gagauzes live side by side with Albanians in Karakurt; Russians and Ukrainians share the same space with Albanians in the Azov Sea region. It is worth mentioning that in these multi-lingual environments, the Albanian patois retains original Balkan features.\"</ref>\n\n==Ethnonym==\n{{Further information|Names of the Albanians and Albania|Albania (toponym)|Shqiptar}}\n\nThe Albanians ({{lang-sq|Shqiptar\u00ebt}}) and their country Albania ({{lang-sq|Shqip\u00ebria}}) have been identified by many [[ethnonym]]s.

Until the fifteenth century the language was known as ''Arb\u00ebrisht'' or ''Arbnisht'', which is still the name used for the language in Italy and Greece. The Greeks refer to all the varieties of Albanian spoken in Greece as Arvanitika. In the second century AD, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer and geographer, used the name ''Albanoi'' to refer to an Illyrian tribe that used to live in what is now central Albania. During the Middle Ages the population of that area was referred to as ''Arbanori'' or ''Albanon''.

Hence, the self-ethnonym ''Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb'' of the present-day Italo-Albanians (numbering about 100,000) in southern Italy and Sicily, whose ancestors, in the wake of the Ottoman wars, emigrated from their homeland in the 14th century. These self-ethnonyms perhaps influenced the Byzantine Greek Arvanites for \u2018Albanians,\u2019 which was followed by similar ones in Bulgarian and Serbian (''Arbanasi''), Ottoman (''Arnaut''), Romanian (''Arb\u0103nas''), and Aromanian (''Arbine\u015f''). It is clear that scholars and Albanians themselves agree that they do not agree on any single etymology of the ethnonym \u2018Albanian.\u2019 A similar predicament is faced by the self-ethnonym ''Shqiptar\u00eb''. The most popular scholarly explanation is that it was formed by analogy to \u2018Slavs\u2019 (*''Slovene''), believed to be derived from ''slovo'' (\u2018word\u2019), and by extension, from *''sluti'' (\u2018to speak clearly.\u2019) The last explanation semantically contrasts with Slavic ''Niemiec'' (\u2018mute,\u2019\u2018stammering,\u2019\u2018babbling\u2019), and Greek \u2018barbarian\u2019 (from ''barbaros'' \u2018those who stammer, babble\u2019). Hence, ''Shqiptar\u00eb'' could be derived from Albanian ''shqipoi'' (from Latin ''excipere'') for \u2018to speak clearly, to understand.\u2019 The Albanian public favors the belief that their self-ethnonym stems from ''shqipe'' (\u2018eagle\u2019) found on the Albanian national flag.\"</ref> The new ethnonyms ''Shqip(\u00eb)tar\u00eb'' and ''Shqip\u00ebria'' emerged and replaced the older ethnonyms ''Arb\u00ebnesh\u00eb/Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb'' and ''Arb\u00ebnia/Arb\u00ebria'' between the late 17th and early 18th centuries.<ref name=\"Lloshi277\"/> That era brought about religious and other sociopolitical changes.<ref name=\"Lloshi277\"/> As such a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different Ottoman world emerging around them was a change in ethnonym.<ref name=\"Lloshi277\">{{harvnb|Lloshi|1999|p=277}}. \"The Albanians of today call themselves ''shqiptar\u00eb'', their country ''Shqip\u00ebri'', and their language ''shqipe''. These terms came into use between the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. Foreigners call them ''albanesi'' (Italian), ''Albaner'' (German), ''Albanians'' (English), ''Alvanos'' (Greek), and ''Arbanasi'' (old Serbian), the country ''Albania'', ''Albanie'', ''Albanien'', ''Alvania'', and ''Albanija'', and the language ''Albanese'', ''Albanisch'', ''Albanian'', ''Alvaniki'', and ''Arbanashki'' respectively. All these words are derived from the name ''Albanoi'' of an Illyrian tribe and their center ''Albanopolis'', noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD. ''Alban'' could be a plural of ''alb''- ''arb''-, denoting the inhabitants of the plains (\u00c7ABEJ 1976). The name passed over the boundaries of the Illyrian tribe in central Albania, and was generalised for all the Albanians. They called themselves ''arb\u00ebnesh'', ''arb\u00ebresh'', the country ''Arb\u00ebni'', ''Arb\u00ebri'', and the language ''arb\u00ebneshe'', ''arb\u00ebreshe''. In the foreign languages, the Middle Ages denominations of these names survived, but for the Albanians they were substituted by ''shqiptar\u00eb'', ''Shqip\u00ebri'' and ''shqipe''. The primary root is the adverb ''shqip'', meaning \"clearly, intelligibly\". There is a very close semantic parallel to this in the German noun ''Deutsche'', \"the Germans\" and \"the German language\" (Lloshi 1984) Shqip spread out from the north to the south, and ''Shqipni/Shqip\u00ebri'' is probably a collective noun, following the common pattern of ''Arb\u00ebni'', ''Arb\u00ebri''. The change happened after the Ottoman conquest because of the conflict in the whole line of the political, social, economic, religious, and cultural spheres with a totally alien world of the Oriental type. A new and more generalised ethnic and linguistic consciousness of all these people responded to this.\"</ref>\n\n== Distribution ==\n{{See also|Albanian diaspora}}\n\n=== Europe ===\n{{See also|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Arbanasi people|l1=Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb|l2=Arbanasi}}\n{{Further information|Albanians in Italy|Albanians in Germany|Albanians in Switzerland|Albanians of Croatia|Albanians in Sweden|Albanians in Ukraine|Albanians of Romania|Albanians in the United Kingdom|l2= Germany|l3= Switzerland|l4= Croatia|l5= Sweden|l6= Ukraine|l7= Romania|l8= the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Albanians in Europe.jpg|thumb|Albanians in [[Europe]].|upright=1.05]][[File:AlbaniansOutsideAlbania.png|thumb|upright=0.75|Distribution of Albanians in neighboring countries]]\n\nApproximately 7&nbsp;million Albanians are to be found within the [[Balkan Peninsula]] with about half this number residing in [[Albania]] and the other divided between [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Greece]] and to a much smaller extent [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Slovenia]].

Their attempts to use early Ottoman provincial surveys (tahrir defterleri) to gauge the ethnic make\u2014up of the population in the fifteenth century have proved little. Leaving aside questions arising from the dialects and pronunciation of the census scribes, interpreters, and even priests who baptized those recorded, no natural law binds ethnicity to name. Imitation, in which the customs, tastes, and even names of those in the public eye are copied by the less exalted, is a time\u2014tested tradition and one followed in the Ottoman Empire. Some Christian sipahis in early Ottoman Albania took such Turkic names as Timurta\u015f, for example, in a kind of cultural conformity completed later by conversion to Islam. Such cultural mimicry makes onomastics an inappropriate tool for anyone wishing to use Ottoman records to prove claims so modern as to have been irrelevant to the pre\u2014modern state. The seventeenth\u2014century Ottoman notable arid author Evliya \u00c7elebi, who wrote a massive account of his travels around the empire and abroad, included in it details of local society that normally would not appear in official correspondence; for this reason his account of a visit to several towns in Kosovo in 1660 is extremely valuable. Evliya confirms that western and at least parts of central Kosovo were \u2018Arnavud\u2019. He notes that the town of Vu\u010ditrn had few speakers of \u2018Bo\u015fnakca\u2019; its inhabitants spoke Albanian or Turkish. He terms the highlands around Tetovo (in Macedonia), Pe\u0107, and Prizren the \u2018mountains of Arnavudluk\u2019. Elsewhere, he states that \u2018the mountains of Pe\u0107\u2019 lay in Arnavudluk, from which issued one of the rivers converging at Mitrovica, just north-west of which he sites Kosovo's border with Bosna. This river, the Ibar, flows from a source in the mountains of Montenegro north\u2014north\u2014west of Pe\u0107, in the region of Rozaje to which the K\u00eblmendi would later be moved. He names the other river running by Mitrovica as the K\u0131lab and says that it, too, had its source in Aravudluk; by this he apparently meant the Lab, which today is the name of the river descending from mountains north\u2014east of Mitrovica to join the Sitnica north of Pri\u0161tina. As Evliya travelled south, he appears to have named the entire stretch of river he was following the K\u0131lab, not noting the change of name when he took the right fork at the confluence of the Lab and Sitnica. Thus, Evliya states that the tomb of Murad I, killed in the battle of Kosovo Polje, stood beside the K\u0131lab, although it stands near the Sitnica outside Pri\u0161tina. Despite the confusion of names, Evliya included in Arnavudluk not only the western fringe of Kosovo, but also the central mountains from which the Sitnica (\u2018K\u0131lab\u2019) and its first tributaries descend. Given that a large Albanian population lived in Kosovo, especially in the west and centre, both before and after the Habsburg invasion of 1689\u201390, it remains possible, in theory, that at that time in the Ottoman Empire, one people emigrated en masse and another immigrated to take its place.</ref> As the Serbs expelled many Albanians from the wider Toplica and Morava regions in Southern Serbia, which the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]] had given to the [[Principality of Serbia]], many of them settled in Kosovo.<ref name=\"Jagodic\">{{harvnb|Jagodi\u0107|1998}}. para. 1\u201371.</ref> In Kosovo, they and their descendants are known as ''Muhaxher'' (meaning ''the exiled'', from the Arabic muhajir).<ref name=\"Uka525354\">{{harvnb|Uka|2004d|p=52}}. \"Pra, k\u00ebtu n\u00eb vazhdim, pas d\u00ebbimit t\u00eb tyre me 1877\u20131878 do t\u00eb sh\u00ebnohen vet\u00ebm disa patronime (mbiemra) t\u00eb shqiptar\u00ebve t\u00eb Toplic\u00ebs dhe viseve tjera shqiptare t\u00eb Sanxhakut t\u00eb Nishit.

In many instances the Arvanites were invited by the Byzantine and Latin rulers of the time. They were employed to resettle areas that had been largely depopulated through wars, epidemics and other reasons, and they were employed as soldiers. Some later movements are also believed to have been motivated to evade Islamisation after the Ottoman conquest. The main waves of the Arvanite migration into southern Greece started around 1300, reached a peak some time during the 14th century, and ended around 1600. Arvanites first reached Thessaly, then Attica and finally the Peloponnese (Clogg. 2002). Regarding the number of Arvanites in Greece, the 1951 census (the last census in Greece that included a question about language) gives a figure of 23.000 Arvaiithka speakers. Sociohinguistic research in the 1970s in the villages of Attica and Biotia alone indicated a figure of at least 30.000 speakers (Trudgill and Tzavaras 1977), while Lunden (1993) suggests 50.000 for Greece as a whole.\"</ref> They are Greek Orthodox Christians, and though they traditionally speak a dialect of [[Tosk Albanian]] known as [[Arvanitika]], they have fully assimilated into the Greek nation and do not identify as Albanians.<ref name=\"Hall2829\">{{harvnb|Hall|1997|pp=28\u201329}}. \"The permeability of ethnic boundaries is also demonstrated in many of the Greek villages of Attiki and Viotia (ancient Attika and Boiotia), where Arvanites often form a majority) These Arvanites are descended from Albanians who first entered Greece between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries (though there was a subsequent wave of immigration in the second half of the eighteenth century). Although still regarded as ethnically distinct in the nineteenth century, their participation in the Greek War of Independence and the Civil War has led to increasing assimilation: in a survey conducted in the 1970s, 97 per crnt of Arvanite informants despite regularly speaking in Arvanitika, considered themselves to be Greek. A similar concern with being identified as Greek is exhibited by the bilingual Arvanites of the Eastern Argolid.\"</ref><ref name=\"Bintliff137138\">{{harvnb|Bintliff|2003|pp=137\u2013138}}. \"First, we can explain the astonishing persistence of Albanian village culture from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries through the ethnic and religious tolerance characteristic of Islamic empires and so lacking in their Christian equivalents. Ottoman control rested upon allowing local communities to keep their religion, language, local laws, and representatives, provided that taxes were paid (the millet system). There was no pressure for Greeks and Albanians to conform to each other's language or other behavior.\nClear signs of change are revealed in the travel diaries of the German scholar Ludwig Ross (1851), when he accompanied the Bavarian Otto, whom the Allies had foisted as king upon the newly freed Greek nation in the aftermath of the War of Independence in the 1830s. Ross praises the well-built Greek villages of central Greece with their healthy, happy, dancing inhabitants, and contrasts them specifically with the hovels and sickly inhabitants of Albanian villages. In fact, recent scholarship has underlined how far it was the West that built modem Greece in its own fanciful image as the land of a long-oppressed people who were the direct descendants of Pericles.\nThus from the late nineteenth century onward the children of the inhabitants of the new \"nation-state\" were taught in Greek, history confined itself to the episodes of pure Greekness, and the tolerant Ottoman attitude to cultural diversity yielded to a deliberate policy of total Hellenization of the populace\u2014effective enough to fool the casual observer. One is rather amazed at the persistence today of such dual-speaking populations in much of the Albanian colonization zone. However, apart from the provinciality of this essentially agricultural province, a high rate of illiteracy until well into this century has also helped to preserve Arvanitika in the Boeotian villagers (Meijs 1993).\"; p. 140. \"In contrast therefore to the more openly problematic issue of Slav speakers in northern Greece, Arvanitic speakers in central Greece lack any signs of an assertive ethnicity. I would like to suggest that they possess what we might term a ''passive ethnicity''. As a result of a number of historical factors, much of the rural population in central Greece was Albanian-speaking by the time of the creation of the modern Greek state in the 1830s. Until this century, most of these people were illiterate and unschooled, yet there existed sufficient knowledge of Greek to communicate with officials and townspeople, itinerant traders, and so on, to limit the need to transform rural language usage. Life was extremely provincial, with just one major carriage-road passing through the center of the large province of Boeotia even in the 1930s (beyond which horseback and cart took over; van Effenterre 1989). Even in the 1960s, Arvanitic village children could be figures of fun for their Greek peers in the schools of Thebes (One of the two regional towns) (K. Sarri, personal communication, 2000). It was not a matter of cultural resistance but simple conservatism and provinciality, the extreme narrowness of rural life, that allowed Arvanitic language and local historic memories to survive so effectively to the very recent period.\"</ref><ref name=\"VeremisKolipoulos2425\">{{harvnb|Veremis|Kolipoulos|2003|pp=24\u201325}}. \"For the time being, the Greeks of free Greece could indulge in defining their brethren of unredeemed Greece, primarily the Slav Macedonians and secondarily the Orthodox Albanians and the Vlachs. Primary school students were taught, in the 1880s, that \u2018Greeks [are] our kinsmen, of common descent, speaking the language we speak and professing the religion we profess\u2019.\" But this definition, it seems, was reserved for small children who could not possibly understand the intricate arguments of their parents on the question of Greek identity. What was essential to understand at that tender age was that modern Greeks descended from the ancient Greeks. Grown up children, however, must have been no less confused than adults on the criteria for defining modern Greek identity. Did the Greeks constitute a \u2018race\u2019 apart from the Albanians, the Slavs and the Vlachs? Yes and no. High school students were told that the \u2018other races\u2019, i.e. the Slavs, the Albanians and the Vlachs, \u2018having been Hellenized with the years in terms of mores and customs, are now being assimilated into the Greeks\u2019. On the Slavs of Macedonia there seems to have been no consensus. Were they Bulgars, Slavicized Greeks or early Slavs? They \u2018were\u2019 Bulgars until the 1870s and Slavicized Greeks, or Hellenized Slavs subsequently, according to the needs of the dominant theory. There was no consensus, either, on the Vlachs. Were they Latinized Greek mountaineers of late immigrants from Vlachia? As in the case of the Slavs of Macedonia, Vlach descent shifted from the southern Balkans to the Danube, until the Romanians claimed the Vlachs for their brethren; which made the latter irrevocably indigenous to the southern Balkan mountains. The Albanians or \u2018Arvanites\u2019, were readily \u2018adopted\u2019 as brethren of common descent for at least three reasons. Firstly, the Albanians had been living in southern Greece, as far south as the Peloponnese, in considerable numbers. Secondly, Christian Albanians had fought with distinction and in considerable numbers in the War of Independence. Thirdly, credible Albanian claims for the establishment of an Albanian nation state materialized too Late for Greek national theorists to abandon well-entrenched positions. Commenting on a geography textbook for primary schools in 1901, a state committee found it inadequate and misleading. One of its principal shortcomings concerned the Albanians, who were described as \u2018close kinsmen of the Greeks\u2019. \u2018These are unacceptable from the point of view of our national claims and as far as historical truth is concerned\u2019, commented the committee. \u2018it must have been maintained that they are of common descent with the Greeks (Pelasgians), that they speak a language akin to that of the Greeks and that they participated in all struggles for national liberation of the common fatherland.\u2019\"</ref> Arvanitika is in a state of attrition due to language shift towards Greek and large-scale internal migration to the cities and subsequent intermingling of the population during the 20th century.\n\nThe [[Cham Albanians]] were a group that formerly inhabited a region of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] known as [[Chameria]], nowadays [[Thesprotia]] in northwestern Greece.

The first category comprises descendants of Albanians who relocated to the Marmara and Aegean regions as part of the Ottoman Empire's administrative structure. Official Ottoman documents record the existence of Albanians living in and around Istanbul (Constantinople), Iznik (Nicaea), and Izmir (Smyrna). For example, between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries Albanian boys were brought to Istanbul and housed in Topkap\u0131 Palace as part of the ''dev\u015firme'' system (an early Ottoman practice of human tribute required of Christian citizens) to serve as civil servants and Janissaries. In the 1600s Albanian seasonal workers were employed by these Albanian Janissaries in and around Istanbul and Iznik, and in 1860 Kayserili Ahmet, the governor of Izmir, employed Albanians to fight the raiding Zeybeks. Today, the descendants of Ottoman Albanians do not form a community per se, but at least some still identify as ethnically Albanian. However, it is unknown how many, if any, of these Ottoman Albanians retain Albanian language skills. The second category of ethnic Albanians living in modern Turkey is composed of people who are the descendants of refugees from the Balkans who because of war were forced to migrate inwards towards Eastern Thrace and Anatolia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as the Ottoman Empire dissolved. These Balkan Albanians are the largest group of ethnic Albanians living in Turkey today, and can be subcategorized into those who ended up in actual Albanian-speaking communities and those who were relocated into villages where they were the only Albanian-speaking migrants. Not surprisingly, the language is retained by some of the descendants from those of the former, but not those of the latter. The third category of ethnic Albanians in Turkey comprises recent or twentieth century migrants from the Balkans. These recent migrants can be subcategorized into those who came from Kosovo in the 1950s\u20131970s, those who came from Kosovo in 1999, and those who came from the Republic of Albania after 1992. All of these in the third category know a variety of modern Albanian and are mostly located in the western parts of Turkey in large metropolitan areas. Our research focuses on the history of migration and community formation of the Albanians located in the Samsun Province in the Black Sea region around 1912\u20131913 who would fall into the second category discussed above (see Figure 1). Turkish census data between 1927 and 1965 recorded the presence of Albanian speakers in Samsun Province, and the fieldwork we have been conducting in Samsun since September 2005 has revealed that there is still a significant number of Albanians living in the city and its surrounding region. According to the community leaders we interviewed, there are about 30,000\u201340,000 ethnic Albanian Turkish citizens in Samsun Province. The community was largely rural, located in the villages and engaged in agricultural activities until the 1970s. After this time, gradual migration to urban areas, particularly smaller towns and nearby cities has been observed. Long-distance rural-to-urban migration also began in later years mostly due to increasing demand for education and better jobs. Those who migrated to areas outside of Samsun Province generally preferred the cities located in the west of Turkey, particularly metropolitan areas such as Istanbul, Izmir and Bursa mainly because of the job opportunities as well as the large Albanian communities already residing in these cities. Today, the size of the Albanian community in Samsun Province is considered to be much smaller and gradually shrinking because of outward migration. Our observation is that the Albanians in Samsun seem to be fully integrated into Turkish society, and engaged in agriculture and small trading businesses. As education becomes accessible to the wider society and modernization accelerates transportation and hence communication of urban values, younger generations have also started to acquire professional occupations. Whilst a significant number of people still speak Albanian fluently as the language in the family, they have a perfect command of the Turkish language and cannot be distinguished from the rest of the population in terms of occupation, education, dress and traditions. In this article, we are interested in the history of this Albanian community in Samsun. Given the lack of any research on the Albanian presence in Turkey, our questions are simple and exploratory. When and where did these people come from? How and why did they choose Samsun as a site of resettlement? How did the socio- cultural characteristics of this community change over time? It is generally believed that the Albanians in Samsun Province are the descendants of the migrants and refugees from Kosovo who arrived in Turkey during the wars of 1912\u201313. Based on our research in Samsun Province, we argue that this information is partial and misleading. The interviews we conducted with the Albanian families and community leaders in the region and the review of Ottoman history show that part of the Albanian community in Samsun was founded through three stages of successive migrations. The first migration involved the forced removal of Muslim Albanians from the Sancak of Nish in 1878; the second migration occurred when these migrants\u2019 children fled from the massacres in Kosovo in 1912\u201313 to Anatolia; and the third migration took place between 1913 and 1924 from the scattered villages in Central Anatolia where they were originally placed to the Samsun area in the Black Sea Region. Thus, the Albanian community founded in the 1920s in Samsun was in many ways a reassembling of the demolished Muslim Albanian community of Nish. This trajectory of the Albanian community of Nish shows that the fate of this community was intimately bound up with the fate of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans and the socio-cultural composition of modern Turkey still carries on the legacy of its historical ancestor.\"</ref> According to a 2008 report prepared for the [[National Security Council (Turkey)|National Security Council]] of Turkey by academics of three Turkish universities in eastern [[Anatolia]], there were approximately 1,300,000 people of Albanian descent living in Turkey.<ref>Milliyet, T\u00fcrkiyedeki K\u00fcrtlerin Say\u0131s\u0131. 2008-06-06.</ref> According to that study, more than 500,000 Albanian descendants still recognize their ancestry and or their language, culture and traditions.<ref name=\"Zamanheritage\">\"[http://www.todayszaman.com/national_albanians-in-turkey-celebrate-their-cultural-heritage_254383.html Albanians in Turkey celebrate their cultural heritage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031102644/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_albanians-in-turkey-celebrate-their-cultural-heritage_254383.html |date=31 October 2015 }}\".

The groups also publish a large number of specialized journals, magazines, and newsletters.\n\nACM also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]] (ICPC), and has sponsored some other events such as the chess match between [[Garry Kasparov]] and the [[IBM Deep Blue]] computer.\n\n==Services==\n\n===Publications===\n{{main cat|Association for Computing Machinery publications}}\nACM publishes over 50 journals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/publications/journals|title=Journals & Magazines|work=acm.org}}</ref> including the prestigious<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Paul Benjamin |last1=Lowry |first2=Denton |last2=Romans |first3=Aaron |last3=Curtis |title=Global Journal Prestige and Supporting Disciplines: A Scientometric Study of Information Systems Journals |journal=[[Journal of the Association for Information Systems]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=29\u201380 |year=2004 |ssrn=666145}}</ref> ''[[Journal of the ACM]]'', and two general magazines for computer professionals, ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' (also known as ''Communications'' or ''CACM'') and ''[[ACM Queue|Queue]]''.

Some of the more notable transactions include:\n**''ACM Transactions on Computer Systems'' (TOCS)\n**''[[IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics]]'' (TCBB)\n**''[[ACM Transactions on Computational Logic]]'' (TOCL)\n**''[[ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction]]'' (TOCHI)\n**''[[ACM Transactions on Database Systems]]'' (TODS)\n**''[[ACM Transactions on Graphics]]'' (TOG)\n**''[[ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software]]'' (TOMS)\n**''[[ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications]]'' (TOMM)\n**''[[IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking]]'' (TON)\n**''[[ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems]]'' (TOPLAS)\n\nAlthough ''Communications'' no longer publishes primary research, and is not considered a prestigious venue, many of the great debates and results in computing history have been published in its pages.\n\nACM has made almost all of its publications available to paid [[subscriber]]s online at its [[#Digital Library|Digital Library]] and also has a [[ACM Guide to Computing Literature|Guide to Computing Literature]]. Individual members additionally have access to [[Safari Books Online]] and Books24x7. ACM also offers insurance, online courses, and other services to its members.\n\nIn 1997, ACM Press published ''Wizards and Their Wonders: Portraits in Computing'' ({{ISBN|0897919602}}), written by Christopher Morgan, with new photographs by [[Louis Fabian Bachrach, Jr.|Louis Fabian Bachrach]]. The book is a collection of historic and current portrait photographs of figures from the computer industry.\n\n==Portal and Digital Library{{anchor|Portal}}{{anchor|Digital Library}}==\nThe '''ACM Portal''' is an online service of the ACM.<ref name=portal>{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/|title=ACM Digital Library|work=acm.org}}</ref> \nIts core are two main sections: '''ACM Digital Library''' and the '''[[ACM Guide to Computing Literature]]'''.<ref>[http://www.libs.uga.edu/research/subject/computer-science The University of Georgia Guide to Online Resources]</ref>\n\nThe ACM Digital Library is the full-text collection of all articles published by the ACM in its articles, magazines and conference proceedings. The Guide is a bibliography in computing with over one million entries.<ref name=portal/>\nThe ACM Digital Library contains a comprehensive archive starting in the 1950s of the organization's journals, magazines, newsletters and conference proceedings. Online services include a forum called Ubiquity and Tech News digest. There is an extensive underlying bibliographic database containing key works of all genres from all major publishers of computing literature. This secondary database is a rich discovery service known as The ACM Guide to Computing Literature.\n\nACM adopted a hybrid [[Open access|Open Access]] (OA) publishing model in 2013. Authors who do not choose to pay the OA fee must grant ACM publishing rights by either a copyright transfer agreement or a publishing license agreement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://authors.acm.org/ | title=ACM Author Rights |publisher=Acm.org}}</ref>\n\nACM was a \"green\" publisher before the term was invented. Authors may post documents on their own websites and in their institutional repositories with a link back to the ACM Digital Library's permanently maintained Version of Record.\n\nAll metadata in the Digital Library is open to the world, including [[abstracts]], linked references and citing works, citation and usage statistics, as well as all functionality and services. Other than the free articles, the full-texts are accessed by subscription.\n\nThere is also a mounting challenge to the ACM's publication practices coming from the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement. Some authors see a centralized peer&ndash;review process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like [[arXiv]]. Other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online, such as [[Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research|Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)]], [[Journal of Machine Learning Research|Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)]] and the Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology.\n\n==Membership grades==\nIn addition to student and regular members, ACM has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and \"demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/membership/membership/senior_members/ |title=ACM Senior Members\u2013An Overview |publisher=Acm.org |access-date=November 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118200303/http://www.acm.org/membership/membership/senior_members/ |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fellows===\n{{main|ACM Fellow|List of Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery}}\nThe [[ACM Fellow]]s Program was established by Council of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1993 \"to recognize and honor outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM.\" Since March 2015, there are about 958 Fellows<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awards.acm.org/fellow/all.cfm |title=List of ACM Fellows |publisher=Awards.acm.org |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}</ref> out of about 75,000 professional members.\n\n===Distinguished Members===\nIn 2006, ACM began recognizing two additional membership grades, one which was called Distinguished Members. Distinguished Members (Distinguished Engineers, Distinguished Scientists, and Distinguished Educators) have at least 15 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership and \"have made a significant impact on the computing field\". Note that in 2006 when the Distinguished Members first came out, one of the three levels was called \"Distinguished Member\" and was changed about two years later to \"Distinguished Educator\". Those who already had the Distinguished Member title had their titles changed to one of the other three titles.\n\n===Senior Members===\nAlso in 2006, ACM began recognizing Senior Members. Senior Members have ten or more years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership.\n\n===Distinguished Speakers===\nWhile not technically a membership grade, the ACM recognizes distinguished speakers on topics in computer science. A distinguished speaker is appointed for a three-year period. There are usually about 125 current distinguished speakers. The ACM website describes these people as 'Renowned International Thought Leaders'.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://speakers.acm.org/ |title = Homepage|website = ACM Distinguished Speakers|publisher = Association for Computing Machinery}}</ref> The distinguished speaker program is overseen by a committee <ref>{{cite web|url = https://speakers.acm.org/committee| title = ACM Speakers Committee|website = ACM Distinguished Speakers|publisher = Association for Computing Machinery}}</ref>\n\nNorman E.

This [[believer's baptism]] is opposed to [[infant baptism|baptism of infants]], who are not able to make a conscious decision to be baptized. Anabaptists are those who are in a traditional line with the early Anabaptists of the 16th century. Other Christian groups with different roots also practice believer's baptism, such as [[Baptists]], but these groups are not seen as Anabaptist. The [[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], and [[Mennonites]] are direct descendants of the early Anabaptist movement. [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], [[Bruderhof]], and the [[Apostolic Christian Church]] are considered later developments among the Anabaptists.\n\nThe name Anabaptist means \"one who baptizes again\".

Anabaptism was never [[State religion|established by any state]] and therefore never enjoyed any of the privileges that come with it. Most Anabaptists adhered to a [[Sermon on the Mount#Analysis and interpretation|literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount]] which precluded taking oaths, participating in military actions, and participating in civil government. Some groups who practiced rebaptism, now extinct, believed otherwise and complied with these requirements of civil society.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">For example, the [[M\u00fcnster Rebellion|followers of Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] and [[Balthasar Hubmaier]].</ref> They were thus technically Anabaptists, even though conservative [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]], [[Hutterites]], and some historians consider them outside true Anabaptism.

For instance, [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]], a 15th-century [[Bohemia]]n reformer, taught most of the beliefs considered integral to Anabaptist theology.<ref>{{Cite book | last= Wagner | first= Murray L | title= Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd: A Radical Separatist in Hussite Bohemia | place=Scottdale, PA | publisher=Herald Press | year=1983 | ISBN=0-8361-1257-1 | page=20}}</ref> Medieval antecedents may include the [[Brethren of the Common Life]], the [[Hussite]]s, Dutch Sacramentists,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/S2384.html | last = van der Zijpp | first = Nanne|title= Sacramentists|publisher= Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online|accessdate=April 12, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070227094841/http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/S2384.html | archivedate= February 27, 2007 | deadurl = no}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Fontaine |first=Piet FM |title=The Light and the Dark: A Cultural History of Dualism |place=Utrecht |publisher=Gopher Publishers |year=2006 |volume=XXIII.

The [[Waldensian]]s also represent a faith similar to the Anabaptists.{{Sfn | van Braght | 1950 | p = 277}}\n\nMedieval dissenters and Anabaptists who held to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount share in common the following affirmations:\n* The believer must not swear oaths or refer disputes between believers to law-courts for resolution, in accordance with {{Bibleref2|1Co|6:1\u201311||1 Corinthians 6:1\u201311}}.\n* The believer must not bear arms or offer forcible resistance to wrongdoers, nor wield the sword. No Christian has the ''[[jus gladii]]'' (the right of the sword). {{Bibleref2 |Matt|5:39||Matthew 5:39}}\n* Civil government (i.e. \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]\") belongs to the world. The believer belongs to God's kingdom, so must not fill any office nor hold any rank under government, which is to be passively obeyed. {{Bibleref2|John|18:36||John 18:36}} {{Bibleref2|Rom|13:1\u20137||Romans 13:1\u20137}}\n* Sinners or unfaithful ones are to be excommunicated, and excluded from the sacraments and from intercourse with believers unless they repent, according to {{Bibleref2|1Co|5:9\u201313||1 Corinthians 5:9\u201313}} and {{Bibleref2|Matt|18:15||Matthew 18:15 seq.}}, but no force is to be used towards them.\n\n=== Zwickau prophets and the German Peasants' War ===\n{{Main|Thomas M\u00fcntzer|Zwickau prophets|German Peasants' War}}\n[[File:Titelblatt 12 Artikel.jpg|thumb|Twelve Articles of the Peasants pamphlet of 1525]]\nOn December 27, 1521, [[Zwickau prophets|three \"prophets\"]] appeared in [[Wittenberg]] from [[Zwickau]] who were influenced by (and, in turn, influencing) [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]]\u2014Thomas Dreschel, [[Nicholas Storch]], and Mark Thomas St\u00fcbner. They preached an apocalyptic, radical alternative to Lutheranism. Their preaching helped to stir the feelings concerning the social crisis which erupted in the [[German Peasants' War]] in southern Germany in 1525 as a revolt against feudal oppression. Under the leadership of M\u00fcntzer, it became a war against all constituted authorities and an attempt to establish by revolution an ideal Christian commonwealth, with absolute equality among persons and the community of goods. The Zwickau prophets were not Anabaptists (that is, they did not practise \"rebaptism\"); nevertheless, the prevalent social inequities and the preaching of men such as these have been seen as laying the foundation for the Anabaptist movement. The social ideals of the Anabaptist movement coincided closely with those of leaders in the German Peasants' War. Studies have found a very low percentage of subsequent sectarians to have taken part in the peasant uprising.{{Sfn | Stayer | 1994}}\n\n=== Views on origins ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nResearch on the origins of the Anabaptists has been tainted both by the attempts of their enemies to slander them and by the attempts of their supporters to vindicate them. It was long popular to classify all Anabaptists as Munsterites and radicals associated with the [[Zwickau prophets]], [[Jan Matthys]], [[John of Leiden]], and [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]]. Those desiring to correct this error tended to over-correct and deny all connections between the larger Anabaptist movement and the most radical elements.\n\nThe modern era of Anabaptist historiography arose with Roman Catholic scholar [[Carl Adolf Cornelius]]' publication of ''Die Geschichte des M\u00fcnsterischen Aufruhrs'' (The History of the M\u00fcnster Uprising) in 1855. Baptist historian [[Albert Henry Newman]] (1852\u20131933), who [[Harold S. Bender]] said occupied \"first position in the field of American Anabaptist historiography\", made a major contribution with his ''A History of Anti-Pedobaptism'' (1897).\n\nThree main theories on origins of the Anabaptists are the following:\n* The movement began in a single expression in [[Z\u00fcrich]] and spread from there (Monogenesis);\n* It developed through several independent movements ([[polygenism|polygenesis]]); and\n* It was a continuation of true New Testament Christianity ([[apostolic succession]] or church perpetuity).\n\n==== Monogenesis ====\n[[File:Ertraenkung felix manz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Felix Manz]] was executed by drowning within two years of his rebaptism]]\nA number of scholars (e.g. Harold S. Bender, William Estep, Robert Friedmann{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}) consider the Anabaptist movement to have developed from the [[Swiss Brethren]] movement of [[Conrad Grebel]], [[Felix Manz]], [[George Blaurock]], et al. They generally held that Anabaptism had its origins in [[Z\u00fcrich]], and that the Anabaptism of the Swiss Brethren was transmitted to southern Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and northern Germany, where it developed into its various branches.  The monogenesis theory usually rejects the M\u00fcnsterites and other radicals from the category of true Anabaptists.{{Sfn | Estep | 1963 | p = 5 | ps = : 'Too much has been said of M\u00fcnster. It belongs on the fringe of Anabaptist life which was completely divorced from the evangelical, biblical heart of the movement'}} In the monogenesis view the time of origin is January 21, 1525, when Conrad Grebel baptized George Blaurock, and Blaurock in turn baptized several others immediately. These baptisms were the first \"re-baptisms\" known in the movement.{{Sfn | Dyck | 1967 | p = 49}} This continues to be the most widely accepted date posited for the establishment of Anabaptism.\n\n==== Polygenesis ====\n[[James M. Stayer]], [[Werner O. Packull]], and [[Klaus Deppermann]] disputed the idea of a single origin of Anabaptists in a 1975 essay entitled \"From Monogenesis to Polygenesis\", suggesting that February 24, 1527, at Schleitheim is the proper date of the origin of Anabaptism. On this date the [[Swiss Brethren]] wrote a declaration of belief called the [[Schleitheim Confession]].<ref name=\"monogenesis\">{{Citation | first1 = James M | last1 = Stayer | first2 = Werner O | last2 = Packull | first3 = Klaus | last3 = Deppermann | title = From Monogenesis to Polygenesis: the historical discussion of Anabaptist origins | journal = Mennonite Quarterly Review | volume = 49 | number = 2 |date=April 1975}}</ref>{{Rp | needed = yes|date=October 2012}} The authors of the essay noted the agreement among previous Anabaptist historians on polygenesis, even when disputing the date for a single starting point: \"Hillerbrand and Bender (like Holl and Troeltsch) were in agreement that there was a single dispersion of Anabaptism ..., which certainly ran through Zurich. The only question was whether or not it went back further to Saxony.\"<ref name=\"monogenesis\" />{{rp |83}} After criticizing the standard polygenetic history, the authors found six groups in early Anabaptism which could be collapsed into three originating \"points of departure\": \"South German Anabaptism, the Swiss Brethren, and the Melchiorites.\"{{Sfn | Stayer | 1994 | p = 86}}  According to their polygenesis theory, South German\u2013Austrian Anabaptism \"was a diluted form of [[Rhineland mysticism]]\", Swiss Anabaptism \"arose out of Reformed [[Congregationalist polity|congregationalism]]\", and Dutch Anabaptism was formed by \"Social unrest and the apocalyptic visions of [[Melchior Hoffman]]\". As examples of how the Anabaptist movement was influenced from sources other than the Swiss Brethren movement, mention has been made of how [[Pilgram Marpeck]]'s ''Vermanung'' of 1542 was deeply influenced by the ''Bekenntnisse'' of 1533 by M\u00fcnster theologian [[Bernhard Rothmann]]. Melchior Hoffman influenced the Hutterites when they used his commentary on the Apocalypse shortly after he wrote it.\n\nOthers who have written in support of polygensis include Grete Mecenseffy and Walter Klaassen, who established links between Thomas M\u00fcntzer and Hans Hut. In another work, Gottfried Seeba\u00df and Werner Packull showed the influence of Thomas M\u00fcntzer on the formation of South German Anabaptism. Similarly, author Steven Ozment linked [[Hans Denck]] and [[Hans Hut]] with Thomas M\u00fcntzer, [[Sebastian Franck]], and others. Author Calvin Pater showed how [[Andreas Karlstadt]] influenced Swiss Anabaptism in various areas, including his view of Scripture, doctrine of the church, and views on baptism.\n\n==== Apostolic succession ====\n[[Baptist successionism|Baptist successionists]] have, at times, pointed to 16th-century Anabaptists as part of an [[apostolic succession]] of churches (\"church perpetuity\") from the time of Christ.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carrol|first=JM|title=The Trail of Blood|publisher=Ashland Avenue Baptist Church|location=Lexington, [[Kentucky|KY]]|year=1931|url=http://www.trailofblood.com/The%20Trail%20Of%20Blood.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221104428/http://www.trailofblood.com/The%20Trail%20Of%20Blood.htm|archivedate=February 21, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This view is held by some Baptists, some Mennonites, and a number of \"true church\" movements.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">A \"true church\" movement is a part of the Protestant or Reformed group of Christianity that claims to represent the true faith and order of New Testament Christianity. Most only assert this in relation to their church doctrines, polity, and practice (e.g., the ordinances), while a few hold they are the only true Christians. Some examples of ''Anabaptistic'' true church movements are the [[Landmark Baptist Church|Landmark Baptists]] and the [[Church of God in Christ, Mennonite]]. The [[Church of God (Charleston, Tennessee)|Church of God]], the Stone-Campbell [[restoration movement]], and others represent a variation in which the \"true church\" apostatized and was restored, in distinction to this idea of apostolic or church succession. These groups trace their \"true church\" status through means other than those generally accepted by Roman Catholicism or Orthodox Christianity, both of which likewise claim to represent the true faith and order of New Testament Christianity.</ref>\n\nThe opponents of the Baptist successionism theory emphasize that these non-Catholic groups clearly differed from each other, that they held some heretical views,<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Such as the Adoptionism of the [[Paulicianists]]; some of the other groups often cited were in fact little different from the Catholics and bore little similarity to modern Baptists.</ref> or that the groups had no connection with one another and had origins that were separate both in time and in place.\n\nA different strain of successionism is the theory that the Anabaptists are of [[Waldensians|Waldensian]] origin. Some hold the idea that the Waldensians are part of the apostolic succession, while others simply believe they were an independent group out of whom the Anabaptists arose. Ludwig Keller, Thomas M. Lindsay, H. C. Vedder, Delbert Gr\u00e4tz, [[John T. Christian]] and [[Thieleman J. van Braght]] (author of [[Martyrs Mirror]]) all held, in varying degrees, the position that the Anabaptists were of Waldensian origin.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Spread of the Anabaptists 1525-1550.png|thumb|Spread of the early anabaptists in Central Europe\n{{legend|violet|Dutch [[Mennonites]]<br>(spread from [[Emden]])}}\n{{legend|blue|South and Central German Anabaptists<br>(spread from [[K\u00f6nigsberg in Franken]])}}\n{{legend|green|[[Swiss Brethren]]<br>(spread from [[Z\u00fcrich]])}}\n{{legend|yellow|Moravian Anabaptists<br>(spread from [[Nikolsburg]])}}]]\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nAnabaptism in Switzerland began as an offshoot of the church reforms instigated by [[Huldrych Zwingli|Ulrich Zwingli]].  As early as 1522 it became evident that Zwingli was on a path of reform preaching when he began to question or criticize such Catholic practices as tithes, the mass, and even infant baptism. Zwingli had gathered a group of reform-minded men around him, with whom he studied classical literature and the scriptures. However, some of these young men began to feel that Zwingli was not moving fast enough in his reform. The division between Zwingli and his more radical disciples became apparent in an October 1523 disputation held in Zurich. When the discussion of the mass was about to be ended without making any actual change in practice, [[Conrad Grebel]] stood up and asked \"what should be done about the mass?\" Zwingli responded by saying the council would make that decision. At this point, Simon Stumpf, a radical priest from Hongg, answered saying, \"The decision has already been made by the Spirit of God.\"<ref name=\"Ruth\">{{cite book | last=Ruth | first=John L.|title=Conrad Grebel, Son of Zurich | publisher=Herald Press | location=Scottdale, PA | year=1975|page=79 |isbn = 0-8361-1767-0}}</ref>\n\nThis incident illustrated clearly that Zwingli and his more radical disciples had different expectations. To Zwingli, the reforms would only go as fast as the city Council allowed them. To the radicals, the council had no right to make that decision, but rather the Bible was the final authority of church reform. Feeling frustrated, some of them began to meet on their own for Bible study.  As early as 1523, William Reublin began to preach against infant baptism in villages surrounding Zurich, encouraging parents to not baptize their children.\n\nSeeking fellowship with other reform-minded people, the radical group wrote letters to [[Martin Luther]], [[Andreas Karlstadt]], and [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]]. [[Felix Manz]] began to publish some of Karlstadt's writings in Zurich in late 1524. By this time the question of infant baptism had become agitated and the Zurich council had instructed Zwingli to meet weekly with those who rejected infant baptism \"until the matter could be resolved\".{{Sfn | Dyck | 1967 | p = 46}} Zwingli broke off the meetings after two sessions, and Felix Manz petitioned the Council to find a solution, since he felt Zwingli was too hard to work with. The council then called a meeting for January 17, 1525.\n\n[[File:T\u00e4uferdisputation 1525.jpg|thumb|Dissatisfaction with the outcome of a disputation in 1525 prompted [[Swiss Brethren]] to part ways with [[Huldrych Zwingli]].]]\nThe Council ruled in this meeting that all who continued to refuse to baptize their infants should be expelled from Zurich if they did not have them baptized within one week. Since Conrad Grebel had refused to baptize his daughter Rachel, born on January 5, 1525, the Council decision was extremely personal to him and others who had not baptized their children. Thus, when sixteen of the radicals met on Saturday evening, January 21, 1525, the situation seemed particularly dark. The Hutterian Chronicle records the event:\n{{quote |After prayer, George of the House of Jacob ([[George Blaurock]]) stood up and besought Conrad Grebel for God's sake to baptize him with the true Christian baptism upon his faith and knowledge. And when he knelt down with such a request and desire, Conrad baptized him, since at that time there was no ordained minister to perform such work.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Chronicle of the Hutterian Brethren, Known as Das grosse Geschichtbuch der Hutterischen Br\u00fcder|location=Rifton, New York|publisher=Plough Pub. House|date=1987|page=45}}</ref>}}\nAfterwards Blaurock was baptized, he in turn baptized others at the meeting.  Even though some had rejected infant baptism before this date, these baptisms marked the first re-baptisms of those who had been baptized as infants and thus, technically, Swiss Anabaptism was born on that day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/issues/issue-28/1525-anabaptist-movement-begins.html|title=1525, The Anabaptist Movement Begins|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://christianhistoryinstitute.org/magazine/article/anabaptist-beginnings|title=A Fire That Spread Anabaptist Beginnings|publisher=Christian History Institute|first=Walter|last=Klaassen|location=Waterloo, ON, Canada|date=1985|issue=no.5|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Tyrol ===\nAnabaptism appears to have come to [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] through the labors of George Blaurock. Similar to the [[German Peasants' War]], the Gasmair uprising set the stage by producing a hope for social justice. [[Michael Gasmair]] had tried to bring religious, political, and economical reform through a violent peasant uprising, but the movement was squashed.<ref>{{cite book | last= Hoover | first= Peter | title= The Mystery of the Mark-Anabaptist Mission Work under the Fire of God | location=Mountain Lake, Minnesota | publisher= Elmendorf Books | year=2008 | pages=14\u201366}}</ref> Although little hard evidence exists of a direct connection between Gasmair's uprising and Tyrolian Anabaptism, at least a few of the peasants involved in the uprising later became Anabaptists. While a connection between a violent social revolution and non-resistant Anabaptism may be hard to imagine, the common link was the desire for a radical change in the prevailing social injustices. Disappointed with the failure of armed revolt, Anabaptist ideals of an alternative peaceful, just society probably resonated on the ears of the disappointed peasants.{{Sfn | Packull | 1995 | pp = 169\u201375}}\n\nBefore Anabaptism proper was introduced to South Tyrol, Protestant ideas had been propagated in the region by men such as Hans Vischer, a former Dominican.  Some of those who participated in conventicles where Protestant ideas were presented later became Anabaptists. As well, the population in general seemed to have a favorable attitude towards reform, be it Protestant or Anabaptist. George Blaurock appears to have preached itinerantly in the Puster Valley region in 1527, which most likely was the first introduction of Anabaptist ideas in the area. Another visit through the area in 1529 reinforced these ideas, but he was captured and burned at the stake in [[Klausen, South Tyrol|Klausen]] on September 6, 1529.{{Sfn | Packull | 1995 | pp = 181\u20135}}\n\n[[Jacob Hutter]] was one of the early converts in South Tyrol, and later became a leader among the [[Hutterites]], who received their name from him. Hutter made several trips between Moravia and Tyrol, and most of the Anabaptists in South Tyrol ended up emigrating to Moravia because of the fierce persecution unleashed by [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]].  In November 1535, Hutter was captured near Klausen and taken to Innsbruck where he was burned at the stake on February 25, 1536. By 1540 Anabaptism in South Tyrol was beginning to die out, largely because of the emigration to Moravia of the converts because of incessant persecution.{{Sfn | Packull | 1995 | p = 280}}\n\n=== The Low Countries and northern Germany ===\n[[Image:Menno Simons.jpg|thumb|Menno Simons]]\n[[Melchior Hoffman]] is credited with the introduction of Anabaptist ideas into the Low Countries. Hoffman had picked up Lutheran and Reformed ideas, but on April 23, 1530 he was \"re-baptized\" at [[Strasbourg]] and within two months had gone to [[Emden]] and baptized about 300 persons.{{Sfn | Estep | 1963 | p = 109}}  For several years Hoffman preached in the Low Countries until he was arrested and imprisoned at Strasbourg, where he died about 10 years later. Hoffman's apocalyptic ideas were indirectly related to the [[M\u00fcnster Rebellion]], even though he was \"of a different spirit\".{{Sfn | Estep | 1963 | p = 111}} [[Obbe Philips|Obbe]] and [[Dirk Philips]] had been baptized by disciples of [[Jan Matthijs]], but were opposed to the violence that occurred at M\u00fcnster.{{Sfn | Dyck | 1967 | p = 105}} Obbe later became disillusioned with Anabaptism and withdrew from the movement in about 1540, but not before ordaining [[David Joris]], his brother [[Dirk Philips|Dirk]], and [[Menno Simons]], the latter from whom the [[Mennonite]]s received their name.{{Sfn | Dyck | 1967 | p = 111}} David Joris and Menno Simons parted ways, with Joris placing more emphasis on \"spirit and prophecy\", while Menno emphasized the authority of the Bible. For the Mennonite side, the emphasis on the \"inner\" and \"spiritual\" permitted compromise to \"escape persecution\", while to the Joris side, the Mennonites were under the \"dead letter of the Scripture\".{{Sfn | Dyck | 1967 | p = 111}} \n\nBecause of persecution and expansion, some of the [[Low Countries|Low Country]] Mennonites emigrated to [[Vistula]] delta, a region settled by Germans but under Polish rule until it became part of [[Prussia]] in 1772. There they formed the [[Vistula delta Mennonites]] integrating some other Mennonites mainly from Northern Germany. In the late 18th century, several thousand of them migrated from there to Ukraine (which at the time was part of Russia) forming the so-called [[Russian Mennonite]]s. Beginning in 1874, many of them emigrated to the prairie states and provinces of the United States and Canada. In the 1920s, the conservative faction of the Canadian settlers went to Mexico and Paraguay. Beginning in the 1950s, the most conservative of them started to migrate to Bolivia. In 1958, Mexican Mennonites migrated to Belize. Since the 1980s, traditional Russian Mennonites migrated to Argentina. Smaller groups went to Brazil and Uruguay. In 2015, some Mennonites from Bolivia settled in Peru. In 2018, there are more than 200,000 of them living in colonies in Central and South America.\n\n=== Moravia, Bohemia and Silesia ===\nAlthough Moravian Anabaptism was a transplant from other areas of Europe, Moravia soon became a center for the growing movement, largely because of the greater religious tolerance found there.{{Sfn | Estep | 1963 | p = 89}}{{Sfn | Packull | 1995 | p = 54}} [[Hans Hut]] was an early evangelist in the area, with one historian crediting him with baptizing more converts in two years than all the other Anabaptist evangelists put together.{{Sfn | Dyck | 1967 | p = 67}} The coming of [[Balthasar H\u00fcbmaier]] to [[Nikolsburg]] was a definite boost for Anabaptist ideas to the area. With the great influx of religious refugees from all over Europe, many variations of Anabaptism appeared in Moravia, with Jarold Zeman documenting at least ten slightly different versions.{{Sfn | Packull | 1995 | p = 55}} Soon, one-eyed Jacob Wiedemann appeared at Nikolsburg, and began to teach the pacifistic convictions of the [[Swiss Brethren]], on which H\u00fcbmaier had been less authoritative. This would lead to a division between the ''Schwertler'' (sword-bearing) and the ''St\u00e4bler'' (staff-bearing). Wiedemann and those with him also promoted the practice of [[community of goods]]. With orders from the lords of Liechtenstein to leave Nikolsburg, about 200 ''St\u00e4bler'' withdrew to Moravia to form a community at Austerlitz.{{Sfn | Packull | 1995 | p = 61}}\n\nPersecution in [[South Tyrol]] brought many refugees to Moravia, many of whom formed into communities that practised community of goods.  [[Jacob Hutter]] was instrumental in organizing these into what became known as the [[Hutterites]]. But others came from [[Silesia]], Switzerland, German lands, and the Low Countries. With the passing of time and persecution, all the other versions of Anabaptism would die out in Moravia leaving only the Hutterites. Even the Hutterites would be dissipated by persecution, with a remnant fleeing to [[Transylvania]], then to the Ukraine, and finally to North America in 1874.{{Sfn | Packull | 1995}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=October 2012}}\n<ref>{{cite book|title=Utopias in American History|first=Jyotsna|last=Sreenivasan|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=2008|pages= 175\u20136|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== South and central Germany, Austria and Alsace ===\n[[File:Thomas Muentzer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] led the German peasants against the landowners]]\nSouth German Anabaptism had its roots in [[German mysticism]]. [[Andreas Karlstadt]], who first worked alongside [[Martin Luther]], is seen as a forerunner of South German Anabaptism because of his reforming theology that rejected many Catholic practices, including infant baptism. However, Karlstadt is not known to have been \"rebaptized\", nor to have taught it. [[Hans Denck]] and [[Hans Hut]], both with German Mystical background (in connection with [[Thomas Muntzer]]) both accepted \"rebaptism\", but Denck eventually backed off from the idea under pressure. Hans Hut is said to have brought more people into early Anabaptism than all the other Anabaptist evangelists of his time put together. However, there may have been confusion about what his baptism (at least some of the times it was done by making the sign of the [[Tau#Symbolism|Tau]] on the forehead) may have meant to the recipient. Some seem to have taken it as a sign by which they would escape the apocalyptical revenge of the Turks that Hut predicted. Hut even went so far as to predict a 1528 coming of the kingdom of God. When the prediction failed, some of his converts became discouraged and left the Anabaptist movement. The large congregation of Anabaptists at Augsburg fell apart (partly because of persecution) and those who stayed with Anabaptist ideas were absorbed into Swiss and Moravia Anabaptist congregations.<ref name=\"Packull-mysticism\">{{cite book | last=Packull | first=Werner O | title=Mysticism and the Early South German-Austrian Anabaptist Movement 1525\u20131531 | location=Scottdale, PA | publisher=Herald Press | year=1977 | isbn=0-8361-1130-3}}</ref>{{rp |35\u2013117}}{{Sfn | Stayer | 1994}}  [[Pilgram Marpeck]] was another notable leader in early South German Anabaptism who attempted to steer between the two extremes of Denck's inner Holiness and the legalistic standards of the other Anabaptists.<ref name=\"fireandwater\">{{cite book|last1=Loewen|first1=Harry|last2=Nolt|first2=Steven|title=Through Fire & Water|date=1996|publisher=Herald Press|location=Scottdale, PA|pages=136\u2013137}}</ref>\n\n== Persecutions and migrations ==\n[[File:Witch-scene4.JPG|thumb|The burning of a 16th-century Dutch Anabaptist, Anneken Hendriks, who was charged with heresy.]]\nRoman Catholics and Protestants alike persecuted the Anabaptists, resorting to torture and execution in attempts to curb the growth of the movement.

The Tudor regime, even the Protestant monarchs ([[Edward VI of England]] and [[Elizabeth I of England]]), persecuted Anabaptists as they were deemed too radical and therefore a danger to religious stability.  The persecution of Anabaptists was condoned by ancient laws of [[Theodosius I]] and [[Justinian I]] that were passed against the [[Donatists]], which decreed the death penalty for any who practised rebaptism. ''[[Martyrs Mirror]]'', by [[Thieleman J. van Braght]], describes the persecution and execution of thousands of Anabaptists in various parts of Europe between 1525 and 1660. Continuing persecution in Europe was largely responsible for the mass emigrations to North America by [[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], and [[Mennonites]].\n\nUnlike [[Calvinists]], Anabaptists failed to get a recognition in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 and persecution continued in Europe well after that treaty.\n\n== Types ==\n{{Main|Theology of Anabaptism}}\nDifferent types exist among the Anabaptists, although the categorizations tend to vary with the scholar's viewpoint on origins. Estep claims that in order to understand Anabaptism, one must \"distinguish between the Anabaptists, inspirationists, and rationalists\". He classes the likes of Blaurock, Grebel, [[Balthasar Hubmaier]], Manz, Marpeck, and Simons as Anabaptists. He groups M\u00fcntzer, Storch, et al. as inspirationists, and anti-trinitarians such as [[Michael Servetus]], [[Juan de Valdes|Juan de Vald\u00e9s]], [[Sebastian Castellio]], and [[Faustus Socinus]] as [[rationalism|rationalists]]. Mark S. Ritchie follows this line of thought, saying, \"The Anabaptists were one of several branches of 'Radical' reformers (i.e. reformers that went further than the mainstream Reformers) to arise out of the Renaissance and [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Two other branches were Spirituals or Inspirationists, who believed that they had received direct revelation from the Spirit, and rationalists or anti-Trinitarians, who rebelled against traditional Christian doctrine, like Michael Servetus.\"\n\nThose of the polygenesis viewpoint use ''Anabaptist'' to define the larger movement, and include the inspirationists and rationalists as true Anabaptists. James M. Stayer used the term ''Anabaptist'' for those who ''rebaptized'' persons already \"baptized\" in infancy. Walter Klaassen was perhaps the first Mennonite scholar to define ''Anabaptists'' that way in his 1960 Oxford dissertation. This represents a rejection of the previous standard held by Mennonite scholars such as Bender and Friedmann.\n\nAnother method of categorization acknowledges regional variations, such as Swiss Brethren (Grebel, Manz), Dutch and [[Frisia]]n Anabaptism (Menno Simons, [[Dirk Philips]]), and South German Anabaptism (H\u00fcbmaier, Marpeck).\n\nHistorians and sociologists have made further distinctions between radical Anabaptists, who were prepared to use violence in their attempts to build a [[New Jerusalem]], and their pacifist brethren, later broadly known as [[Mennonites]]. Radical Anabaptist groups included the M\u00fcnsterites, who occupied and held the German city of [[M\u00fcnster]] in 1534\u20131535, and the [[Batenburgers]], who persisted in various guises as late as the 1570s.\n\n== Spirituality ==\n[[File:Z\u00fcrich - Schipfe IMG 1969.JPG|thumb|Memorial plate at [[Schipfe]] quarter in [[Z\u00fcrich]] for the Anabaptists executed in the early 16th century by the Z\u00fcrich city government]]\n\n=== Charismatic manifestations ===\nWithin the inspirationist wing of the Anabaptist movement, it was not unusual for [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] manifestations to appear, such as dancing, falling under the power of the Holy Spirit, \"prophetic processions\" (at Zurich in 1525, at Munster in 1534 and at Amsterdam in 1535),{{Sfn | Klaassen | 1973 | p = 63}} and speaking in tongues.<ref>{{Citation | first = Franklin H | last = Little | title = The Origins of Sectarian Protestantism | place = New York | publisher = Beacons | year = 1964 | page = 19}}</ref> In Germany some Anabaptists, \"excited by mass hypnosis, experienced healings, glossolalia, contortions and other manifestations of a camp-meeting revival\".{{Sfn | Williams | 2000 | p = 667}}  The Anabaptist congregations that later developed into the Mennonite and Hutterite churches tended not to promote these manifestations, but did not totally reject the miraculous. [[Pilgram Marpeck]], for example, wrote against the exclusion of miracles: \"Nor does Scripture assert this exclusion ...  God has a free hand even in these last days.\" Referring to some who had been raised from the dead, he wrote: \"Many of them have remained constant, enduring tortures inflicted by sword, rope, fire and water and suffering terrible, tyrannical, unheard-of deaths and martyrdoms, all of which they could easily have avoided by recantation.  Moreover one also marvels when he sees how the faithful God (Who, after all, overflows with goodness) raises from the dead several such brothers and sisters of Christ after they were hanged, drowned, or killed in other ways. Even today, they are found alive and we can hear their own testimony ...  Cannot everyone who sees, even the blind, say with a good conscience that such things are a powerful, unusual, and miraculous act of God? Those who would deny it must be hardened men.\"{{Sfn | Marpeck | 1978 | p = 50}}  The [[Hutterite]] Chronicle and The [[Martyrs Mirror]] record several accounts of miraculous events, such as when a man named Martin prophesied while being led across a bridge to his execution in 1531: \"this once yet the pious are led over this bridge, but no more hereafter\". Just \"a short time afterwards such a violent storm and flood came that the bridge was demolished\".{{Sfn | van Braght | 1950 | p = 440}}\n\n=== Holy Spirit leadership ===\nThe Anabaptists insisted upon the \"free course\" of the Holy Spirit in worship, yet still maintained it all must be judged according to the Scriptures.<ref>{{Citation | first = John S | last = Oyer | title = Lutheran Reformers Against Anabaptists | place = The Hague | publisher = M Nijhoff | year = 1964 | page = 86}}</ref> The Swiss Anabaptist document titled \"Answer of Some Who Are Called (Ana-)Baptists&nbsp;\u2013 Why They Do Not Attend the Churches\". One reason given for not attending the state churches was that these institutions forbade the congregation to exercise spiritual gifts according to \"the Christian order as taught in the gospel or the Word of God in 1 Corinthians 14\". \"When such believers come together, 'Everyone of you (note every one) hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation', and so on. When someone comes to church and constantly hears only one person speaking, and all the listeners are silent, neither speaking nor prophesying, who can or will regard or confess the same to be a spiritual congregation, or confess according to 1 Corinthians 14 that God is dwelling and operating in them through His Holy Spirit with His gifts, impelling them one after another in the above-mentioned order of speaking and prophesying.\"<ref>{{Citation | editor1-first = Paul | editor1-last = Peachey | editor2-first = Shem | editor2-last = Peachey | title = Answer of Some Who Are Called (Ana-)Baptists&nbsp;\u2013 Why They Do Not Attend the Churches | journal = Mennonite Quarterly Review | volume = 45 | number = 1 | year = 1971 | pages = 10, 11}}</ref>\n\n== Today ==\n\n=== Anabaptists ===\n[[File:Hutterer-Chor1.jpeg|thumb|[[Hutterite]]s in North America]]\n[[File:Mennonite Family - Campeche - Mexico - 02.jpg|thumb|[[Mennonites in Mexico|Mennonite]] family in [[Campeche]], Mexico]]\n[[File:Amish - On the way to school by Gadjoboy-crop.jpg|thumb|Amish children on their way to school]]\n\nSeveral existing denominational bodies are the direct successors of the continental Anabaptists.

The majority of Southeast Alaska's area is part of the [[Tongass National Forest]], the United States' largest [[United States National Forest|national forest]]. In many places, the [[international border]] runs along the crest of the [[Boundary Ranges]] of the [[Coast Mountains]] (see [[Alaska boundary dispute]]). The region is noted for its scenery and mild rainy [[climate]].\n\nThe largest cities in the region are [[Juneau]], [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], and [[Ketchikan]].\n[[Image:MistyFjordsWaterfall.jpg|thumb|right|Misty Fjords Waterfall and kayak]]\n[[File:Southeast Alaska K\u00f6ppen.png|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] in southeast Alaska]]\n[[Image:TongassForest1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Tongass National Forest]], near [[Ketchikan]]]]\n[[Image:CruiseShipsKetchikan.jpg|thumb|right|Cruise ships at Ketchikan]]\n\n==Geography==\n\nSoutheast Alaska is the northern terminus of the [[Inside Passage]], a protected waterway of convoluted passages between islands and fjords, beginning in [[Puget Sound]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state. This was an important travel corridor for [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] and [[Haida people|Haida]] Native peoples, as well as gold-rush era steamships. In modern times it is an important route for [[Alaska Marine Highway]] ferries as well as [[cruise ship]]s.  \nSoutheast Alaska has a land area of {{convert|35138|sqmi|sqkm}}{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} comprising seven entire [[county-equivalent|borough]]s and two [[census area]]s, in addition to the portion of the [[Yakutat City and Borough, Alaska|Yakutat Borough]] lying east of [[141st meridian west|141\u00b0 West]] longitude. Although it has only 6.14 percent of Alaska's land area, it is larger than the state of [[Maine]], and almost as large as the state of [[Indiana]]. The Southeast Alaskan coast is roughly as long as the [[British Columbia Coast|west coast]] of Canada. The [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] population of Southeast was 71,616 inhabitants, about 45 percent of whom were concentrated in the city of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]].\n*[[Haines Borough, Alaska|Haines Borough]]\n*[[Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska|Hoonah-Angoon Census Area]]\n*[[Juneau City and Borough, Alaska|Juneau Borough]]\n*[[Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska|Ketchikan Gateway Borough]]\n*[[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg Borough]]\n*[[Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area, Alaska|Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area]]\n*[[Sitka City and Borough, Alaska|Sitka Borough]]\n*[[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway Borough]]\n*[[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell Borough]]\n*[[Yakutat City and Borough, Alaska|Yakutat Borough]] (the part east of [[141st meridian west|141\u00b0 W]]  longitude; 12,506.53&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> / 4,828.80&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi, or about 63.12 percent of the borough)\nIt includes the [[Tongass National Forest]] (which manages [[Admiralty Island National Monument]] and [[Misty Fjords National Monument]]), [[Glacier Bay National Park]], [[Sitka National Historical Park]], [[Alaska's Inside Passage]], and myriad large and small islands. The largest islands are, from North to South, [[Chichagof Island]], [[Admiralty Island]], [[Baranof Island]], [[Kupreanof Island]], [[Revillagigedo Island]] and [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]]. Major bodies of water of Southeast Alaska include [[Glacier Bay]], [[Lynn Canal]], [[Icy Strait]], [[Chatham Strait]], [[Stephens Passage]], [[Frederick Sound]], [[Sumner Strait]], and [[Clarence Strait]].\n\nOn August 20, 1902, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established the [[Alexander Archipelago Forest Reserve]], which formed the heart of the [[Tongass National Forest]] that covers most of the region.\n\n==National parks and monuments==\n*[[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve]]\n*[[Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park]]\n*[[Sitka National Historical Park]]\n*[[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve]] (part, the southeasternmost section only)\n*[[Admiralty Island National Monument]]\n*[[Misty Fjords National Monument]]\n\n==Ecology==\nSoutheast Alaska is a [[temperate rain forest]] within the [[Pacific temperate rain forest]] zone, as classified by the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[ecoregion]] system, which extends from northern [[California]] to [[Prince William Sound]]. The most common tree species are [[sitka spruce]] and [[western hemlock]].\nWildlife includes [[brown bear]]s, [[American black bear|black bears]], the endemic [[Alexander Archipelago wolf]], [[black-tailed deer|Sitka black-tailed deer]], [[humpback whale]]s, [[orca]]s, five species of [[salmon]], [[bald eagle]]s, [[harlequin duck]]s, [[scoter]]s, and [[marbled murrelet]]s.\n\nThe [https://indd.adobe.com/view/bb243dff-5852-44c5-bdf5-4b1be96bdc53 Ecological Atlas of Southeast Alaska], published by Audubon Alaska in 2016, offers an overview of the region's landscape, birds, wildlife, human uses, climate change, and more, synthesizing data from agencies and a variety of other sources.\n\n==Cities and towns==\nMajor cities are [[Juneau City and Borough, Alaska|Juneau]], [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]], and [[Sitka City and Borough, Alaska|Sitka]].

While the British foreign affairs were in favor of support of the Canadian argument, the event resulted in what was thought of as a betrayal, leading to [[Alaska_boundary_dispute#Canadian_controversy|alienation of the British]] from the new nation of [[Canada]].\n\n==Transportation==\nDue to the extremely rugged, mountainous nature of Southeastern Alaska, almost all communities (with the exception of [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]], [[Skagway]], and [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]) have no road connections outside of their locale, so aircraft and boats are the major means of transport. The [[Alaska Marine Highway]] passes through this region.\n\n===Air transportation===\n[[Alaska Airlines]] is by far the largest air carrier in the region, with Juneau's [[Juneau International Airport]] serving as the aerial hub for all of Southeast and Ketchikan's [[Ketchikan International Airport]] serving as a secondary hub for southern Southeast Alaska. Alaska's [[Bush aviation|bush airlines ]] and [[air taxi]]s serve many of the smaller and more isolated communities and villages in the regions. Many communities are accessible by air only by [[floatplane]], as proper runways are often difficult to construct on the steep island slopes.\n\n===Marine transportation===\nSoutheast Alaska is primarily served by the state-run [[Alaska Marine Highway]], which links Skagway, Haines, [[Hoonah, Alaska|Hoonah]], [[Juneau]], [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]], [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]], [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] and other outlying communities with [[Prince Rupert, BC]] and [[Bellingham, Washington]]; and secondarily by the [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]]-based [[Inter-Island Ferry Authority]], which provides the only scheduled passenger and auto ferry service to the island. A new Authority, the Rainforest Islands Ferry Authority, was created and in 2014 may possibly operate the North End route. The Authority would connect Coffman Cove with Wrangell and Petersburg. Small companies like Sitka-based Allen Marine and other independent operators in the [[Lynn Canal]] occasionally also offer marine passenger service.

It is largely [[wilderness]]. Mountains include [[Denali]] in the [[Alaska Range]], the [[Wrangell Mountains]], and the [[Ray Mountains]]. The [[Alaska Natives|native people]] of the interior are [[Alaskan Athabaskans]]. The largest city in the interior is [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]]'s second-largest city, in the [[Tanana Valley]]. Other towns include [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]], just southeast of Fairbanks, [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]], [[Tok, Alaska|Tok]], [[Glennallen, Alaska|Glennallen]], [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]], [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]], [[Anderson, Alaska|Anderson]], [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] and [[Cantwell, Alaska|Cantwell]].

Both the highest and lowest temperature records for the state were set in the Interior, with 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) in [[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]] and \u221280&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221264&nbsp;\u00b0C) in [[Prospect Creek, Alaska|Prospect Creek]].<ref name=DRI>{{cite web | title = State Extremes | publisher = Western Regional Climate Center, [[Desert Research Institute]] | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html | accessdate = 2007-01-03 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070105015744/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html| archivedate= 5 January 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Temperatures within a given winter are highly variable as well; extended cold snaps of forty below zero can be followed by unseasonable warmth with temperatures above freezing due to [[chinook wind]] effects.\n\nSummers can be warm and dry for extended periods creating ideal fire weather conditions. Weak thunderstorms produce mostly dry lightning, sparking wildfires that are mostly left to burn themselves out as they are often far from populated areas. The [[2004 Alaska fire season|2004 season]] set a new record with over {{convert|6600000|acre|km2}} burned.\n[[File:Lakesalaskarange.JPG|thumb|left|Lakes and peaks of the Alaska Range seen from the [[Denali Highway]]]]\nThe average annual precipitation in Fairbanks is 11.3&nbsp;inches (28.7&nbsp;cm).  Most of this comes in the form of snow during the winter.  Most storms in the interior of Alaska originate in the [[Gulf of Alaska]], south of the state, though these storms often have limited precipitation due to a [[rain shadow]] effect caused by the [[Alaska Range]].\n\nOn clear winter nights, the [[aurora borealis]] can often be seen dancing in the sky.  Like all subarctic regions, the months from May to July in the summer have no night, only a twilight during the night hours. The months of November to January have little daylight.  Fairbanks receives an average 21 hours of daylight between May 10 and August 2 each summer, and an average of less than four hours of daylight between November 18 and January 24 each winter.\n\nThe interior of Alaska is largely underlined by discontinuous [[permafrost]], which grades to continuous permafrost as the [[Arctic Circle]] is approached.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\"  caption=\"Summer 2009 Fires (outlined in red)\">\nImage:Fires in Interior Alaska.jpg|Fires in Interior Alaska from July 7, 2009.\nImage:Hundreds of Thousands of Acres Burning in Interior Alaska (natural).jpg|The thick pall of smoke the fires were creating (August 2, 2009).\nImage:Hundreds of Thousands of Acres Burning in Interior Alaska.jpg|Visible, short wave and near-[[infra-red]] image showing burned areas (brick red) and unburned vegetation (bright green) (August 2, 2009).\n</gallery>\n{{#lst:Fairbanks, Alaska|weather box}}\n\n== Alaska Natives ==\nWhile the vast majority of indigenous [[Alaska Natives|Native]] people of Interior Alaska are [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabaskan Indians]], large [[Yup'ik]] and [[I\u00f1upiaq]] populations reside in [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]].<ref name=\"Interiorservice\">ihs.gov: [http://www.ihs.gov/alaska/includes/themes/newihstheme/display_objects/documents/hf/Interior.pdf Interior Alaska Service Area]</ref>\n\nThe [[List of Alaska Native tribal entities|federally recognized tribes]] of Interior Alaska:<ref name=\"Interiorservice\"/> \n* [[Council of Athabascan Tribal Governments]] (CATG): [[Beaver Village]], [[Birch Creek Tribe]], [[Circle Native Community]], [[Native Village of Fort Yukon]], [[Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government]] (also known as Arctic Village and Village of Venetie).\n* [[Tanana Chiefs Conference]] (TCC): [[Allakaket Village]], [[Alatna Village]], [[Village of Anaktuvuk Pass]], [[Chalkyitsik Village]], [[Village of Dot Lake]], [[Native Village of Eagle]], [[Evansville Village]] (also known as Bettles Field), [[Galena Village]] (also known as Louden Village), [[Healy Lake Village]], [[Hughes Village]], [[Huslia Village]], [[Village of Kaltag]], [[Koyukuk Native Village]], [[Manley Hot Springs Village]], [[Native Village of Minto]], [[Nenana Native Association]], [[Nikolai Village]] (Edzeno\u2019 Native Council), [[Northway Village]], [[Nulato Village]], [[Rampart Village]], [[Native Village of Ruby]], [[Native Village of Stevens]], [[Native Village of Tanacross]], [[Telida Village]], [[Native Village of Tetlin]].\n* [[Tanana Tribal Council]]: [[Native Village of Tanana]].\n* Other places in the Interior Service Area not Federally Recognized as [[tribe (Native American)|Tribes]]: [[Alcan Border, Alaska|Alcan]], [[Anderson, Alaska|Anderson]], [[Big Delta, Alaska|Big Delta]], [[Canyon Village, Alaska|Canyon Village]], [[Central, Alaska|Central]], [[Chatanika, Alaska|Chatanika]], [[Chicken, Alaska|Chicken]], [[Clear, Alaska|Clear]], [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]], [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Fox, Alaska|Fox]], [[Indian River, Alaska|Indian River]], [[Kokrines, Alaska|Kokrines]], [[Lake Minchumina, Alaska|Lake Minchumina]], [[Medfra, Alaska|Medfra]], [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]], [[Salcha, Alaska|Salcha]], [[Tok, Alaska|Tok]], [[Toklat, Alaska|Toklat]], [[Tolovana, Alaska|Tolovana]], [[Wiseman, Alaska|Wiseman]], [[Wood River, Alaska|Wood River]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Wikivoyage|Interior Alaska|Alaska Interior}}\n<references/>\n\n{{Alaska}}\n\n{{coord|65|N|152|W|region:US-AK_type:adm1st_scale:10000000|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Regions of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Tourism regions of Alaska]]", "sha1": "rocf6igts9h3epsy8giqm4zpaa6nzgy"}}, {"title": "And did those feet in ancient time", "ns": "0", "id": "2940", "revision": {"id": "866675219", "parentid": "865223926", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T20:31:31Z", "contributor": {"username": "ShadessKB", "id": "23637506"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n{{Infobox anthem \n|title = And did those feet in ancient time \n|alt_title = Jerusalem\n|image = Milton preface.jpg{{!}}border\n|caption = The preface to ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'', as it appeared in Blake's own illuminated version\n|prefix = Unofficial national\n|country = {{ENG}}\n|author = [[William Blake]]\n|lyrics_date = 1804\n|composer = [[Hubert Parry]]\n|music_date = 1916\n}}\n\"'''And did those feet in ancient time'''\" is a  poem by [[William Blake]] from the preface to his epic ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]]'', one of a collection of writings known as the [[Blake's prophetic books|Prophetic Books]].

I know not oh I know not what joys await me there....' uses Jerusalem for the same metaphor.}}\n\nIn the most common interpretation of the poem, Blake implies that a visit by Jesus would briefly create heaven in England, in contrast to the \"dark Satanic Mills\" of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Blake's poem asks four questions rather than asserting the historical truth of Christ's visit. Thus the poem merely implies that there may, or may not, have been a divine visit, when there was briefly heaven in England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theoneshow/onepassions/2008/10/whats-your-anthem.html |title= The One Show |publisher=BBC |date=17 October 2008 |accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref><ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/bring-no-spears-to-jerusalem-1347934.html John Walsh ''[[The Independent]]'' 18 May 1996]</ref>\n\n==Text==\nThe original text is found in the preface Blake wrote for inclusion with ''Milton, a Poem'', following the lines beginning \"The Stolen and Perverted Writings of Homer & Ovid: of Plato & Cicero, which all Men ought to contemn: ...\"<ref name=\"blakearchive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/transcription.xq?objectid=milton.b.illbk.02|first=William|last=Blake|title=''Milton a Poem'', copy B object 2|work=[[The William Blake Archive]]|publisher=Ed.

This church preached a doctrine of conformity to the established social order and class system, in contrast to Blake. In 2007 the new [[Bishop of Durham]], [[N. T.

Satan's \"mills\" are referred to repeatedly in the main poem, and are first described in words which suggest neither industrialism nor ancient megaliths, but rather something more abstract: \"the starry Mills of Satan/ Are built beneath the earth and waters of the Mundane Shell...To Mortals thy Mills seem everything, and the Harrow of [[El Shaddai|Shaddai]] / A scheme of human conduct invisible and incomprehensible\".<ref>Blake, William, ''Milton: A Poem'', plate 4.</ref>\n\n===\"Chariot of fire\"===\nThe line from the poem \"Bring me my Chariot of fire!\" draws on the story of [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#2:11|2 Kings 2:11]], where the [[Old Testament]] prophet [[Elijah]] is taken directly to heaven: \"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\"  The phrase has become a byword for divine energy, and inspired the title of the 1981 film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', in which the hymn Jerusalem is sung.  The plural phrase \"chariots of fire\" refers to 2 Kings 6:16\u201318.\n\n===\"Green and pleasant Land\"===\nBlake lived in London for most of his life, but wrote much of ''Milton'' while living in the village of [[Felpham]] in Sussex.

He added a four-bar musical introduction to each verse and a [[coda (music)|coda]], echoing melodic [[motif (music)|motif]]s of the song.  The word \"those\" was substituted for \"these\" before \"dark satanic mills\".\n\nThe piece was to be conducted by Parry's former student [[Walford Davies]], but Parry was initially reluctant to set the words, as he had doubts about the ultra-patriotism of Fight for Right, but not wanting to disappoint either Robert Bridges or Davies he agreed, writing it on 10 March 1916, and handing the manuscript to Davies with the comment, \"Here's a tune for you, old chap. Do what you like with it.\"<ref>Benoliel, Bernard, Parry Before Jerusalem, Ashgate, Aldershot, 1997</ref> Davies later recalled,\n\n{{quote|We looked at [the manuscript] together in his room at the [[Royal College of Music]], and I recall vividly his unwonted happiness over it&nbsp;... He ceased to speak, and put his finger on the note D in the second stanza where the words 'O clouds unfold' break his rhythm. I do not think any word passed about it, yet he made it perfectly clear that this was the one note and one moment of the song which he treasured&nbsp;...<ref name=\"dibble\">Dibble, Jeremy, C. Hubert H. Parry: His life and music, Oxford University Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nDavies arranged for the vocal score to be published by [[Curwen Press|Curwen]] in time for the concert at the [[Queen's Hall]] on 28 March and began rehearsing it.<ref name=\"Wilt\">Christopher Wiltshire (Former archivist, British Federation of Festivals for Music, Speech and Dance), [https://www.theguardian.com/letters/story/0,3604,408355,00.html Guardian newspaper 8 December 2000 Letters: Tune into Jerusalem's fighting history] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 8 December 2000.</ref> It was a success and was taken up generally.\n\nBut Parry began to have misgivings again about Fight for Right and eventually wrote to Sir [[Francis Younghusband]] withdrawing his support entirely in May 1917. There was even concern that the composer might withdraw the song, but the situation was saved by [[Millicent Fawcett]] of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS). The song had been taken up by the Suffragists in 1917 and Fawcett asked Parry if it might be used at a Suffrage Demonstration Concert on 13 March 1918. Parry was delighted and orchestrated the piece for the concert (it had originally been for voices and organ). After the concert, Fawcett asked the composer if it might become the Women Voters' Hymn. Parry wrote back,\n\n{{quote|I wish indeed it might become the Women Voters' hymn, as you suggest. People seem to enjoy singing it. And having the vote ought to diffuse a good deal of joy too. So they would combine happily.<ref name=\"dibble\"/>}}\n\nAccordingly, he assigned the copyright to the NUWSS. When that organisation was wound up in 1928, Parry's executors reassigned the copyright to the [[Women's Institutes]], where it remained until it entered the public domain in 1968.<ref name=\"dibble\"/>\n\nThe song was first called \"And Did Those Feet in Ancient Time\" and the early published scores have this title. The change to \"Jerusalem\" seems to have been made about the time of the 1918 Suffrage Demonstration Concert, perhaps when the orchestral score was published (Parry's manuscript of the orchestral score has the old title crossed out and \"Jerusalem\" inserted in a different hand).<ref>The manuscripts of the song with organ and with orchestra, and of Elgar's orchestration, are in the library of the Royal College of Music, London</ref> However, Parry always referred to it by its first title. He had originally intended the first verse to be sung by a solo female voice (this is marked in the score), but this is rare in contemporary performances.

One unexpected touch is that \"Jerusalem\" is sung in four-part harmony, as if it were truly a hymn. This is not authentic: Parry's composition was a unison song (that is, all voices sing the tune \u2013 perhaps one of the things that make it so \"singable\" by massed crowds) and he never provided any harmonisation other than the accompaniment for organ (or orchestra). Neither does it appear in any standard hymn book in a guise other than Parry's own, so it may have been harmonised specially for the film. The film's working title was \"Running\" until [[Colin Welland]] saw a television programme, ''[[Songs of Praise]]'', featuring the hymn and decided to change the title.<ref name=\"welland\" />\n\nThe hymn has featured in many other films and television programmes including ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', ''[[How to Get Ahead in Advertising]]'', ''[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (film)|The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]'', ''[[Calendar Girls]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Goodnight Mister Tom (1998 film)|Goodnight Mr. Tom]]'', ''[[Women in Love]]'', ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', ''[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]'', and ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. An extract was heard in the 2013 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Crimson Horror]]\" although that story was set in 1893, i.e., before Parry's arrangement. A punk version is heard in [[Derek Jarman]]'s 1977 film ''[[Jubilee (1978 film)|Jubilee]]''.

[[Tim Blake]] (synthesiser player of [[Gong (band)|Gong]]) produced a solo album in 1978 called ''[[Blake's New Jerusalem]]'', including a 20-minute track with lyrics from Blake's poem. [[Mark E.

The words, with some variations, are used in the track \"Jerusalem\" on [[Bruce Dickinson]]'s album ''[[The Chemical Wedding (Bruce Dickinson album)|The Chemical Wedding]]'', which also includes lines from book two of ''Milton''. [[Finn Coren]] also created a different musical setting for the poem on his album ''[[The Blake Project: Spring]]''.

Inspired by the [[Ingmar Bergman]] film ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'', it involves the romantic lives of several couples. Its title is a literal English translation of the German name for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Eine kleine Nachtmusik|Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major]], ''Eine kleine Nachtmusik''. The musical includes the popular song \"[[Send in the Clowns]]\".\n\nSince its original 1973 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, the musical has enjoyed professional productions in the [[West End theatre|West End]], by opera companies, in a 2009 Broadway revival, and elsewhere, and it is a popular choice for regional groups. It was [[A Little Night Music (film)|adapted for film in 1977]], with [[Harold Prince]] directing and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Lesley-Anne Down]], and [[Diana Rigg]] starring.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act One===\nThe setting is [[Sweden]], around the year 1900. One by one, the Quintet \u2013 five singers who comment like a [[Greek chorus]] throughout the show \u2013 enter, tuning up. Gradually, their vocalizing becomes an overture blending fragments of \"Remember\", \"Soon\" and \"The Glamorous Life\", leading into the first \"Night Waltz\". The other characters enter [[waltz]]ing, each uncomfortable with her partner. After they drift back off, the aging and sardonic Madame Armfeldt and her solemn granddaughter, Fredrika, enter. Madame Armfeldt tells the child that the summer night \"smiles\" three times: first on the young, second on fools, and third on the old. Fredrika vows to watch the smiles occur. Middle-aged Fredrik Egerman is a successful lawyer. He has recently married an 18-year-old [[trophy wife]], Anne, a naive girl who loves Fredrik but is too immature to grasp the concept of marriage. The two have been married for eleven months, but Anne still protects her [[virginity]]. Fredrik plots how he might [[seduce]] his wife (\"Now\"). Meanwhile, his son Henrik, a [[seminary]] student a year older than his stepmother, is frustrated and ignored (\"Later\"). Anne promises her husband that shortly she will consent to have sex (\"Soon\"), which leads into all three of them lamenting at once. Anne's [[maidservant]] Petra, an experienced and forthright girl, slightly older than the teen herself, offers her worldly but crass advice.\n\nDesiree Armfeldt is a prominent and glamorous actress who is now reduced to touring in small towns. Madame Armfeldt, Desiree's mother, has taken over the care of Desiree's daughter Fredrika. Fredrika misses her mother, but Desiree continually delays going to see her, preferring, somewhat ironically, \"The Glamorous Life\". She is performing near Fredrik's home, and Fredrik brings Anne to see the play. While there, Desiree notices Fredrik in the audience; the two had been lovers years earlier. Anne, suspicious and annoyed at Desiree's amorous glances, demands that Fredrik take her home immediately. Meanwhile, Petra tries to seduce a nervous and petulant Henrik.\n\nThat night, as Fredrik remembers his past with Desiree, he sneaks out to see her; the two have a happy but strained reunion as they \"Remember\". They reflect on their new lives, and Fredrik tries to explain how much he loves Anne (\"You Must Meet My Wife\"). Desiree responds sarcastically and boasts of her own adultery, as she has been seeing the married [[dragoon]], Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm. Upon learning that Fredrik has gone for eleven months without sex, she agrees to accommodate him as a favor for an old friend.\n\nMadame Armfeldt offers advice to young Fredrika. The elderly woman reflects poignantly on her own checkered past, and wonders what happened to her refined \"Liaisons\". Back in Desiree's apartment, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm proclaims his unannounced arrival in his usual booming tones. Fredrik and Desiree fob off the Count with an innocent explanation for their disheveled appearance, but he is still suspicious. He instantly dislikes Fredrik and returns to his wife, Countess Charlotte. Charlotte is quite aware of her husband's infidelity, but Carl-Magnus is too absorbed in his suspicions of Desiree to talk to her (\"In Praise of Women\"). When she persuades him to blurt out the whole story, a twist is revealed&mdash;Charlotte's little sister is a schoolfriend of Anne's.\n\nCharlotte visits Anne and describes Fredrik's tryst with Desiree. Anne is shocked and saddened, but Charlotte explains that such is the lot of a wife, and love brings pain (\"Every Day A Little Death\"). Meanwhile, Desiree asks Madame Armfeldt to host a party for Fredrik, Anne and Henrik. Though reluctant, Madame Armfeldt agrees. She sends out a personal invitation; its receipt sends Anne into a frenzy, imagining \"A Weekend in the Country\" with the Armfeldts. Anne does not want to accept the invitation, but Charlotte convinces her to do so to heighten the contrast between the older woman and the young and beautiful teenager. Charlotte relates this to the Count, who (much to her chagrin) decides to visit the Armfeldts uninvited. Carl-Magnus plans to challenge Fredrik to a [[duel]], while Charlotte hopes to seduce the lawyer to make her husband jealous and end his philandering. The act ends as all characters set off to Madame Armfeldt's estate.\n\n===Act Two===\nArmfeldt's country estate is bathed in the golden glow of perpetual summer sunset at this high latitude (\"Night Waltz One and Two\"). Everyone arrives, each with their own amorous purposes and desires\u2014even Petra, who catches the eye of Armfeldt's fetching [[manservant]], Frid. The women begin to quarrel with one another. Fredrik is astonished to learn the name of Desiree's daughter. Henrik meets Fredrika, and confesses his deep love for Anne to her. Meanwhile, in the garden, Fredrik and Carl-Magnus reflect on how difficult it is to be annoyed with Desiree, agreeing \"It Would Have Been Wonderful\" had she not been quite so wonderful. Dinner is served, and the characters' \"Perpetual Anticipation\" enlivens the meal.\n\nAt dinner, Charlotte attempts to flirt with Fredrik, and trades insults with Desiree. Soon, everyone is shouting and scolding everyone else, except for Henrik, who finally speaks up. He accuses the whole company of being [[amorality|amoral]], and flees the scene. Stunned, everyone reflects on the situation and wanders away. Fredrika tells Anne of Henrik's secret love, and the two dash off searching for him. Meanwhile, Desiree meets Fredrik and asks if he still wants to be \"rescued\" from his life. Fredrik answers honestly that he loves Desiree, but cannot bring himself to part with Anne. Hurt and bitter, Desiree can only reflect on the nature of her life and relationship to Fredrik (\"[[Send In the Clowns]]\"). Anne finds Henrik, who is attempting to commit suicide. The clumsy boy cannot complete the task, and Anne tells him that she loves him, too. The pair begins to kiss, which leads to Anne's first sexual encounter. Meanwhile, not far away, Frid sleeps in Petra's lap. The maid imagines advantageous marriages, but concludes that in the meantime, \"a girl ought to celebrate what passes by\" (\"The Miller's Son\"). Charlotte confesses her plan to Fredrik, and both watch as Henrik and Anne, happy together, run away to start their new life. The two commiserate on a bench. Carl-Magnus, preparing to romance Desiree, sees this and challenges Fredrik to [[Russian Roulette]], at which a nervous Fredrik misfires and simply grazes his own ear. Victorious, Carl-Magnus begins to romance Charlotte, granting her wish at last.\n\nAfter the Count and Countess leave, Fredrika and Madame Armfeldt discuss the chaos of the recent turns-of-events. The elderly woman then asks Fredrika a surprising question: \"What is it all for?\" Fredrika thinks about this, and decides that love, for all of its frustrations, \"must be worth it\". Madame Armfeldt is surprised, ruefully noting that she rejected love for material wealth at Fredrika's age. She praises her granddaughter and remembers true love's fleeting nature.\n\nFredrik finally confesses his love for Desiree, acknowledging that Fredrika is his daughter, and the two promise to start a new life together (\"Send in the Clowns\" - reprise). Armfeldt sits alone with Fredrika. Fredrika tells her grandmother that she has watched carefully, but still has not seen the night smile. Armfeldt laughs and points out that the night has indeed smiled twice: first on Henrik and Anne, the young, and second on Desiree and Fredrik, the fools. As the two wait for the \"third smile... on the old\", it occurs: Madame Armfeldt closes her eyes, and dies peacefully with Fredrika beside her.\n\n== Musical numbers ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* Overture \u2013 Mr. Lindquist, Mrs. Nordstrom, Mrs. Anderssen, Mr. Erlanson and Mrs. Segstrom (the \"Quintet\")\n* \"Night Waltz\" \u2013 Company\n* \"Now\" \u2013 Fredrik Egerman\n* \"Later\" \u2013 Henrik Egerman\n* \"Soon\" \u2013 Anne Egerman\n* \"Soon/Later/Now\" \u2013 Anne, Henrik and Fredrik\n* \"The Glamorous Life\" \u2013 Fredrika Armfeldt, Desiree Armfeldt, Madame Armfeldt and Quintet\n* \"Remember?\" \u2013 Quintet\n* \"You Must Meet My Wife\" \u2013 Desiree and Fredrik\n* \"Liaisons\" \u2013 Madame Armfeldt\n* \"In Praise of Women\" \u2013 Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm\n* \"Every Day a Little Death\" \u2013 Countess Charlotte Malcolm and Anne\n* \"Weekend in the Country\" \u2013 Company\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* Entr'acte \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"Night Waltz I (The Sun Won't Set)\" \u2013 Quintet\n* \"Night Waltz II (The Sun Sits Low)\" \u2013 Quintet\n* \"It Would Have Been Wonderful\" \u2013 Fredrik and Carl-Magnus\n* \"Perpetual Anticipation\" \u2013 Mrs. Nordstrom, Mrs. Segstrom and Mrs. Anderssen\n* \"Dinner Table Scene\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"[[Send In the Clowns]]\" \u2013 Desiree\n* \"The Miller's Son\" \u2013 Petra\n* \"The World Won't End/Every Day a Little Death (reprise)\" \u2013 Desiree and Charlotte   \n* Reprises <small>(\"Soon\", \"You Must Meet My Wife\", \"A Weekend in the Country\" and \"Every Day a Little Death\")</small> \u2013 Quintet\n* \"Send in the Clowns\" (Reprise) \u2013 Desiree and Fredrik\n* \"Last Waltz\" \u2013 Orchestra\n{{col-end}}\n\n; Additional musical numbers\n'''Stage:'''\n* \"Two Fairy Tales\" \u2013 Henrik and Anne <small>(cut for time)</small>\n* \"Silly People\" \u2013 Frid <small>(cut for time)</small>\n* \"Bang!\" \u2013 Carl-Magnus <small>(replaced by \"In Praise of Women\")</small>\n* \"My Husband the Pig\" \u2013 Charlotte <small>(replaced by the second half of \"In Praise of Women\")</small>\n\n'''Screen:'''\n* \"Love Takes Time\" \u2013 Company <small>(lyrics added to Night Waltz)</small>\n* \"The Glamorous Life\" \u2013 Fredrika <small>(solo version)</small>\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Fredrik Egerman''': A successful widowed middle-aged lawyer.

The setting for the film was moved from Sweden to Austria. [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote lyrics for the \"Night Waltz\" theme (\"Love Takes Time\") and wrote an entirely new version of \"The Glamorous Life\", which has been incorporated into several subsequent productions of the stage musical.

The film marked Broadway director [[Hal Prince]]'s second time as a motion picture director.

The difficulty is heightened when songs merge, as in \"Now\"/\"Later\"/\"Soon\", because all three have to be performed in the same key, limiting the ability to pick a comfortable key for each singer. Critic [[Rex Reed]] noted that \"The score of 'Night Music' ...contains patter songs, contrapuntal duets and trios, a quartet, and even a dramatic double quintet to puzzle through. All this has been gorgeously orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick; there is no rhythm section, only strings and woodwinds to carry the melodies and harmonies aloft.\"<ref>Deutsch, Didier C.[http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/a-little-night-music \"'A Little Night Music' Liner Notes, Song List and Synopsis\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105094459/http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/a-little-night-music |date=2011-01-05 }} masterworksbroadway.com, retrieved June 9, 2010</ref>\n\nSondheim's engagement with threes extends to his lyrics.

Sondheim said: \"As for the three songs ... going together well, I might as well confess. In those days I was just getting into contrapuntal and choral writing...and I wanted to develop my technique by writing a trio. What I didn't want to do is the [[quodlibet]] method...wouldn't it be nice to have three songs you don't think are going to go together, and they do go together ... The trick was the little [[vamp (music)|vamp]] on \"Soon\" which has five-and six-note chords.\"<ref name=swayne>Swayne, Steve.

When he discovered that the original Desiree, [[Glynis Johns]], was able to sing (she had a \"small, silvery voice\")<ref name=secrest>Secrest, Meryle. \"Stephen Sondheim: A Life\" (1998). Dell Publishing. {{ISBN|0-385-33412-5}}, pp. 251\u2013252</ref> but could not \"sustain a phrase\", he devised the song \"[[Send in the Clowns]]\" for her in a way that would work around her vocal weakness, e.g., by ending lines with consonants that made for a short cut-off.<ref name=secrest/> \"It is written in short phrases in order to be acted rather than sung ... tailor-made for Glynis Johns, who lacks the vocal power to sustain long phrases.\"<ref>Sondheim, S., Shevelove, B., Gelbart, L., Wheeler, H., and Lapine, J.  \"Four by Sondheim, Wheeler, Lapine, Shevelove and Gelbart\" (2000). Hal Leonard Corporation. {{ISBN|1-55783-407-5}}, p. 170</ref>\n\nIn analyzing the text of the song, [[Max Cryer]] wrote that it \"is not intended to be sung by the young in love, but by a mature performer who has seen it all before. The song remains an anthem to regret for unwise decisions in the past and recognition that there's no need to send in the clowns \u2013 they're already here.\"<ref>Cryer, Max. ''Love Me Tender: The Stories Behind the World's Best-loved Frances Lincoln Ltd, 2008, {{ISBN|0-7112-2911-2}}, p. 171</ref>\n\nGraham Wolfe has argued, \"What Desir\u00e9e is referring to in the famous song is a conventional device to cover over a moment when something has gone wrong on stage. Midway through the second Act she has deviated from her usual script by suggesting to Fredrik the possibility of being together seriously and permanently, and, having been rejected, she falters ''as'' a show-person, finds herself bereft of the capacity to improvise and wittily cover. If Desir\u00e9e could perform at this moment \u2013 revert to the innuendos, one-liners and blithe self-referential humour that constitutes her normal character \u2013 all would be well. She cannot, and what follows is an exemplary manifestation of Sondheim\u2019s musico-dramatic complexity, his inclination to write music that performs drama. That is, what needs to be covered over (by the clowns sung about in the song) is the very intensity, ragged emotion and utter vulnerability that comes forward through the music and singing itself, a display protracted to six minutes, wrought with exposed silences, a shocked Fredrik sitting so uncomfortably before Desir\u00e9e while something much too real emerges in a realm where he \u2013 and his audience \u2013 felt assured of performance.\"<ref>Wolfe, Graham. \"Sondheim's ''A Little Night Music'': Reconciling the Comic and the Sublime.\" ''Studies in Musical Theatre'' 8.2 (2014): 143-157.</ref>\n\n===Influences===\nThere is a [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] reference in the title&mdash;''A Little Night Music'' is an occasionally used translation of ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]'', the nickname of Mozart's [[Serenade No. 13 (Mozart)|Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major]], [[K\u00f6chel catalogue|K.]] 525.

Mr Judge's great innovation is to transform the Liebeslieder Singers from the evening-dressed, after-dinner line-up into 18th century ghosts weaving in and out of the action...But Mr Judge's other great realisation is that, in Sondheim, the lyrics are not an adornment to a song but their very essence: understand them and the show will flow.

The score positively throbs with love, regret and desire.\" But of the specific production, the reviewer went on to note: \"But Nunn's production, on one of those hermetic sets largely consisting of doors and tarnished mirrors that have become such a clich\u00e9 in recent years, never penetrates the work's subtly erotic heart. And as is often the case with this director's work, the pace is so slow and the mood so reverent, that initial enchantment gives way to bored fidgeting.\"<ref name=telegraph/>\n\nIn his ''New York Times'' review of the 2009 Broadway production, [[Ben Brantley]] noted that \"the expression that hovers over Trevor Nunn's revival...feels dangerously close to a smirk...It is a smirk shrouded in shadows. An elegiac darkness infuses this production.\" The production is \"sparing on furniture and heavy on shadows\", with \"a scaled-down orchestra at lugubriously slowed-down tempos...\" He goes on to write that \"this somber, less-is-more approach could be effective were the ensemble plugged into the same rueful sensibility. But there is only one moment in this production when all its elements cohere perfectly. That moment, halfway through the first act, belongs to Ms. Lansbury, who has hitherto been perfectly entertaining, playing Madame Armfeldt with the overripe aristocratic condescension of a Lady Bracknell. Then comes her one solo, \"Liaisons\", in which her character thinks back on the art of love as a profession in a gilded age, when sex 'was but a pleasurable means to a measurable end.' Her face, with its glamour-gorgon makeup, softens, as Madame Armfeldt seems to melt into memory itself, and the wan stage light briefly appears to borrow radiance from her. It's a lovely example of the past reaching out to the present...\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/theater/reviews/14little.html|title=A Weekend in the Country With Eros and Thanatos|last=Brantley|first=Ben|date=2009-12-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313085109/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/theater/reviews/14little.html|archivedate=2017-03-13|df=}}</ref>\n\nSteven Suskin, reviewing the new Broadway cast for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', wrote \"What a difference a diva makes.

[[Eskrima]], the traditional martial arts of the Philippines teaches ''Doble Baston'' techniques involving the basic use of a pair of [[rattan sticks]] and also Espada y daga or Sword/Stick and Dagger. [[Okinawan martial arts]] have a method that uses a pair of [[Sai (weapon)|''sai'']].  [[Chinese martial arts]] involve the use of a pair of [[butterfly sword]]s and [[hook sword]]s. [[Gatka]], a weapon-based martial art from the [[Punjab region]], is known to use two sticks at a time. The Thailand weapon-based martial art [[Krabi Krabong]] involves the use of a separate [[Krabi (sword)|''Krabi'']] in each hand. [[Kalaripayattu]] teaches advanced students to use either two sticks (of various sizes) or two daggers or two swords, simultaneously. One of the oldest mentions of dual wielding are the gladiator style known as dimachaerus, where a gladiator would use two swords of the same length, sometimes straight and sometimes crooked midways up the blade.  North American Indian tribes of the Atlantic northeast used a form involving a [[tomahawk]] in the primary hand and [[longknife]] in the secondary.  It is practiced today as part of the modern Cree martial art [[Okichitaw]].\n\nAll the above-mentioned examples, involve either one long and one short weapon, or two short weapons.  An example of a dual wield of two sabres is the Ukrainian cossack dance [[hopak]].\n\n==Modern times==\n[[File:Alison Carroll 20080927 Festival du jeu video 02.jpg|thumb|Model dressed as [[Lara Croft]] dual wielding pistols]]\nDual wielding two handguns was said to have been popularized by the passion of gun enthusiasts and television.<ref name=\"GunDigestGuide2010\">{{cite book|author=Jerry Ahern|title=Gun Digest Buyer's Guide to Concealed-Carry Handguns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulWbH-4xtd8C|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=5 October 2010|publisher=F+W Media, Inc|isbn=978-1-4402-1767-8|pages=135\u2013137|chapter=18}}</ref> In modern terms, the use of a gun in each hand is most associated with the [[American Old West]], mainly due to media portrayals.

In the meantime, he occupied the position of an [[infantry]] [[brigade]] commander and received a [[law degree]] from [[Tel Aviv University]]. However, when [[Yitzhak Rabin]] became [[Ramatkal|Chief of Staff]] in 1964, Sharon again began to rise rapidly in the ranks, occupying the positions of Infantry School Commander and Head of Army Training Branch, eventually achieving the rank of [[Aluf]] ([[Major General]]).\n\nIn the [[Six-Day War]], Sharon, in command of an [[armored division]] on the [[Sinai]] [[Front (military)|front]], drew up his own complex offensive strategy that combined infantry troops, tanks and paratroopers from planes and helicopters to destroy the Egyptian forces Sharon's [[319th Division|38th Division]] faced when it broke through to the Kusseima-Abu-Ageila fortified area.<ref name=\"ha'aretz obit\"/> Sharon's victories and offensive strategy in the [[Battle of Abu-Ageila (1967)|Battle of Abu-Ageila]] led to international commendation by military strategists; he was judged to have inaugurated a new paradigm in operational command. Researchers at the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] studied Sharon's operational planning, concluding that it involved a number of unique innovations. It was a simultaneous attack by a multiplicity of small forces, each with a specific aim, attacking a particular unit in a synergistic Egyptian defense network. As a result, instead of supporting and covering each other as they were designed to do, each Egyptian unit was left fighting for its own life.<ref>''Hollow Land: Israel's Architecture of Occupation'', by Eyal Weizman, Verso 2012, page 76</ref>\n\nAccording to Sapir Handelman, after Sharon's [[Battle of Abu-Ageila (1967)|assault of the Sinai in the Six-Day War]] and his [[Yom Kippur War#Israeli breakthrough|encirclement of the Egyptian Third Army in the Yom Kippur War]], the Israeli public nicknamed him \"The King of Israel\".<ref>''Conflict and Peacemaking in Israel-Palestine: Theory and Application'', By Sapir Handelman, (Routledge 2011), page 58: \"for the majority of Israelis, Sharon became once more the \"King of Israel\".</ref>\n\nSharon played a key role in the [[War of Attrition]]. In 1969, he was appointed the Head of IDF's [[Southern Command (Israel)|Southern Command]]. As leader of the southern command, on July 29 Israeli frogmen [[Operation Bulmus 6|stormed and destroyed Green Island]], a fortress at the northern end of the Gulf of Suez whose radar and antiaircraft installations controlled that sector's airspace. On September 9 Sharon's forces carried out [[Operation Raviv]], a large-scale raid along the western shore of the Gulf of Suez. Landing craft ferried across Russian-made tanks and armored personnel carriers that Israel had captured in 1967, and the small column harried the Egyptians for ten hours.<ref>Ariel Sharon, ''Warrior,'' Siomon & Shuster 1989, page 223</ref>\n\nFollowing his appointment to the southern command, Sharon had no further promotions, and considered retiring.

A wall of sand and earth raised along almost the entire length of the Suez Canal would both allow observation of Egyptian forces and conceal the movements of Israeli troops on the eastern side. This line, named after the chief of staff Haim Bar Lev, became known as the [[Bar Lev Line]].

He then tried to join the Labor Party and the [[centrism|centrist]] [[Democratic Movement for Change]], but was rejected by those parties too.

During this period, Sharon supported the [[Gush Emunim]] settlements movement and was viewed as the patron of the settlers' movement.

Sharon declared that the complex would remain under perpetual Israeli control. Palestinian commentators accused Sharon of purposely inflaming emotions with the event to provoke a violent response and obstruct success of delicate ongoing peace talks. On the following day, a large number of Palestinian demonstrators and an Israeli police contingent confronted each other at the site.

However, it was greeted with opposition from within his own Likud party and from other right wing Israelis, on national security, military, and religious grounds.\n\n===Disengagement from Gaza===\nOn December 1, 2004, Sharon dismissed five ministers from the Shinui party for voting against the government's 2005 budget. In January 2005, Sharon formed a [[national unity government]] that included representatives of Likud, Labor, and [[Meimad]] and [[Degel HaTorah]] as \"out-of-government\" supporters without any seats in the government ([[United Torah Judaism]] parties usually reject having ministerial offices as a policy). Between August 16 and 30, 2005, Sharon controversially expelled 9,480 Jewish settlers from 21 settlements in Gaza and four settlements in the northern West Bank. Once it became clear that the evictions were definitely going ahead, a group of conservative Rabbis, led by [[Yosef Dayan]], placed an ancient curse on Sharon known as the [[Pulsa diNura]], calling on the [[Destroying angel (Bible)|Angel of Death]] to intervene and kill him. After Israeli soldiers bulldozed every settlement structure except for several former synagogues, Israeli soldiers formally left Gaza on September 11, 2005 and closed the border fence at [[Kissufim]]. While his decision to withdraw from Gaza sparked bitter protests from members of the Likud party and the settler movement, opinion polls showed that it was a popular move among most of the Israeli electorate, with more than 80 percent of Israelis backing the plans.<ref>{{cite news |deadurl=no |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/12/09/israel.government/index.html |title=Sharon party agrees coalition plan |agency=[[CNN]] |date=December 10, 2004 |accessdate=August 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625000052/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/12/09/israel.government/index.html |archivedate=June 25, 2009 |df=mdy}}</ref> On September 27, 2005, Sharon narrowly defeated a leadership challenge by a 52\u201348 percent vote.

The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence.

At one point, Dita decided to return to Israel, but after Vera was informed by the Israel Lands Administration that it would not be legally possible to split the family property between Ariel and Dita, and informed her that she would not be able to build a home there, Dita, believing she was being lied to, permanently cut her family in Israel off, and refused to attend the funerals of her mother and sister-in-law.

Both live in undisturbed rainforest, and are essentially miniature [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]]. They are similar in appearance to a [[deer]], weighing {{convert|150|-|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nBoth species of anoa have been classified as [[endangered]] since the 1960s, and the population continues to decrease.  Fewer than 5000 animals of each species likely remain.  Reasons for their decline include hunting for [[hide (skin)|hide]], [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s, and [[meat]] by the local peoples and loss of habitat due to the advancement of settlement.  Currently, hunting is the more serious factor in most areas.\n\nAfter a study of the skulls of many Anoa it was shown that there was hybridizing and interbreeding between the two. It was questioned as to whether the two species were actually different due to mixing of the two in many different areas as well as some interbreeding. After analyzing the DNA of the two it was proven that they are in fact different species. \n\n== Lowland anoa ==\n[[File:Lowland Anoa.JPG|thumb|left|Lowland anoa]]\nThe '''lowland anoa''' (''Bubalus depressicornis'') is a small [[bovid]], standing barely over {{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder. They are also known as ''anoa de Ilanura'' or ''anoa des plaines''. It is most closely allied to the larger Asiatic buffaloes, showing the same reversal of the direction of the hair on their backs. The [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s are peculiar for their upright direction and comparative straightness, although they have the same triangular section as in other buffaloes. White spots are sometimes present below the eyes, and there may be white markings on the legs and back; the absence or presence of these white markings may be indicative of distinct [[race (biology)|race]]s. The horns of the cows are very small. The nearest allies of the anoa appear to be certain extinct buffaloes, the remains of which are found in the [[Siwalik Hills]] of northern India. In habits, the animal appears to resemble the [[Indian buffalo]].<!-- [[Water buffalo]]? --><ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anoa|volume=2|page=79}}</ref> It is usually solitary, living in [[lowland]] [[tropical rainforest|forests]] and [[wetland]]s, browsing on plants and [[understory]].\n\n== Mountain anoa ==\n[[File:Buablus quarlesi2.jpg|left|thumb|Mountain anoa]]\n'''Mountain anoa''' (''Bubalus quarlesi'') are also known as ''anoa de montana'', ''anoa de Quarle, anoa des montagnes, anoa pegunungan,'' and Quarle's anoa. Standing at {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, it is even smaller than the lowland anoa and the smallest of all [[Bovini|wild cattle]]. They also have longer, [[wool]]ier hair that moults every February to April, showing faint spots on the head, neck, and limbs.<ref name=\"ARKive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/mountain-anoa/bubalus-quarlesi|title=Mountain anoa videos, photos and facts \u2013 Bubalus quarlesi \u2013 ARKive|work=ARKive}}</ref>\nBoth are found on the island of [[Sulawesi]] and the nearby island of [[Buton]] in [[Indonesia]]. They apparently live singly or in pairs, rather than in herds like most cattle, except when the cows are about to give birth. Little is known about their life history as well. However in captive individuals they have a life expectancy of 20-30 years.  The Anoa take 2-3 years before they reach sexual maturity and have one calf a year and have very rarely been seen to have more. \n\n\n==Habitat==\nBoth the Lowland Anoa ''Bubalus depressicornis'' and the Mountain Anoa ''Bubalus quarlesi'' are endemic to the islands of Sulawesi in Indonesia. Sulawesi is a unique area due to the fact that roughly 61% of the species found there are endemic species including the Anoa. \n\nThe key difference between the two species is the areas of habitat that is utilized on the islands. The Mountain Anoa is found at higher elevations than its counterpart and is found in the forested mountainous regions. The Lowland Anoa spends its time in the lower elevation areas and is also found in core habitat of forested area. The habitat needs of both species can have some overlap and often times the two species are found in the same areas. The key factor to where they are found is core forested habitat away from humans. \n\n==Morphology==\n\nThe Anoa have many physical characteristics of bovine relatives and are considered to be most closely related to the Asian Water Buffalo which was confirmed through DNA analysis. However some scientists believe they may be more closely related to the Asiatic Antelope. All Anoa vary in appearance a good amount but have the same standard characters.\n\nThe two species diverged due to a difference in elevation and a slight change in habitat from the latter, but their physical characteristics remain similar. The Anoa is the smallest of the wild cattle species. When Anoa are born they have a set of thick wooly fur that comes in many color variations from yellow to brown. In adults the fur is typically a brown or black and males tend to have darker variations. Hair thickness varies slightly between the two species based on elevation and distribution. In both Species of Anoa horns are present both males and females and are typically straight protuberances. Another defining characteristic of the Anoa is an extremely thick hide underneath the thick fur. \n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe Anoa are endemic to the region of Sulawesi and are currently experiencing large declines in their populations. Knowledge of their decline has only recently been documented however and the villages and villagers lack the knowledge of how to help maintain or increase populations. \n\nThe leading cause of their population decline is in fact hunting by the local villagers and not having restrictions or proper management strategies.{{fact|date=May 2018}} The one benefit is that villagers are open to communication with researchers on their harvests and hunting practices. The second leading cause of population decline is habitat loss and in the region of Tangkoko the Anoa are actually extirpated. \n\nLogging is a large issue due to the fact that both species prefer core forested habitat that is far away from humans and the influences that come with them. By logging humans create much more fragmented habitat and therefore a decrease in the area where the Anoa can breed and live. This habitat fragmentation also alters the natural mixing of populations of Anoa and may lead to a loss in genetic diversity of the two species and over time could also lead to their decline.\n\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Bubalus depressicornis}}\n{{Commons category|Bubalus quarlesi}}\nDIET COMPOSITION OF ANOA (Buballus sp.)

His early work in scrutinizing the use of local, exchange and trunk telephone line usage in a small community to understand the theoretical requirements of an efficient network led to the creation of the [[Erlang formula]], which became a foundational element of modern [[telecommunication]] network studies.\n\n== Life ==\n\nErlang was born at L\u00f8nborg, near [[Tarm]], in [[Jutland]].  He was the son of a schoolmaster, and a descendant of [[Thomas Fincke]] on his mother's side.  At age 14, he passed the Preliminary Examination of the [[University of Copenhagen]] with distinction, after receiving dispensation to take it because he was younger than the usual minimum age.  For the next two years he taught alongside his father.\n\nA distant relative provided free board and lodging, and Erlang prepared for and took the University of [[Copenhagen]] entrance examination in 1896, and passed with distinction.  He won a scholarship to the University and majored in [[mathematics]], and also studied [[astronomy]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].  He graduated in 1901 with an MA and over the next 7 years taught at several schools. He maintained his interest in mathematics, and received an award for a paper that he submitted to the University of Copenhagen.\n\nHe was a member of the Danish Mathematicians' Association (TBMI) and through this met amateur mathematician [[Johan Jensen (mathematician)|Johan Jensen]], the Chief Engineer of the [[Copenhagen Telephone Company]] (KTAS in Danish), an [[Corporate spin-off|offshoot]] of the [[International Bell Telephone Company]].  Erlang worked for the CTC (KTAS) from 1908 for almost 20 years, until his death in Copenhagen after an abdominal operation.\n\nHe was an associate of the British [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]].\n\n== Contributions ==\n\nWhile working for the CTC, Erlang was presented with the classic problem of determining how many circuits were needed to provide an acceptable telephone service.  His thinking went further by finding how many [[Switchboard operator |telephone operators]] were needed to handle a given volume of calls.  Most [[telephone exchange]]s then used human operators and [[telephone switchboard|cord boards]] to switch [[telephone call]]s by means of jack plugs.\n\nOut of necessity, Erlang was a hands-on researcher.  He would conduct measurements and was prepared to climb into street [[manhole]]s to do so. <!-- He famously said that this was a \"no brainer.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The actual quote in Danish w/translation would be desired. --> He was also an expert in the history and calculation of the numerical tables of mathematical functions, particularly [[logarithm]]s.  He devised new calculation methods for certain forms of tables.\n\nHe developed his theory of telephone traffic over several years.  His significant publications include:\n* 1909 \u2013 \"The Theory of Probabilities and Telephone Conversations\", which proves that the [[Poisson distribution]] applies to random telephone traffic.<ref>{{cite journal |title= The Theory of Probabilities and Telephone Conversations |journal= Nyt Tidsskrift for Matematik |pages= 33-39 |issue= B |volume= 20 |date= 1909 |url= https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0010648031&origin=inward&txGid=c040f22392ef895c6eba0b47f1844f8c }}</ref>\n* 1917 \u2013 \"Solution of some Problems in the Theory of Probabilities of Significance in Automatic Telephone Exchanges\", which contains his classic formulae for [[Grade of service#Erlang's lost call assumptions|call loss]] and waiting time<ref>{{cite journal |title= Solution of some Problems in the Theory of Probabilities of Significance in Automatic Telephone Exchanges |journal= Elektrotkeknikeren |volume= 13 |page= 5 |date= 1917 |url= http://oldwww.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/erlangbook/pps138-155.pdf |format= pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= July 19, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719122546/http://oldwww.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/erlangbook/pps138-155.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThese and other notable papers were translated into English, French and German.

One of the latter was a Sondheim-Laurents musical (now named ''Side Show'').<ref name=horowitz/> In a letter to Bloomgarden, Laurents wrote, \"I beg you not to mention the money problems or any difficulties to Steve anymore. It depresses him terribly and makes it terribly difficult for him to work... It is damn hard to concentrate ... when all the atmosphere is filled with gloom and forebodings about will the show get the money to go on? ... Spare him the gory details.\" This behavior is considered unusual for Laurents, which runs contrary to his current reputation. Sondheim discovered that Laurents hated doing backers' auditions and he took over that responsibility, playing and singing more than 30. They found 115 investors to back the $350,000 production, including [[Richard Rodgers]] and Sondheim's father.<ref name=horowitz/>\n\nEager to work with both Laurents and Sondheim, Angela Lansbury accepted the lead role as Mayoress Cora Hoover Hooper, despite her strong misgivings about the script and her ability to handle the score. Also signed were [[Lee Remick]] as Nurse Fay Apple and [[Harry Guardino]] as Hapgood. Laurents had wanted [[Barbra Streisand]] for the role of Fay, but she turned it down to star in ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]''.<ref>Laurents, Arthur. ''Original Story By -: A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood''. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2001, {{ISBN|1-55783-467-9}}, p. 244</ref>  Following rehearsals in New York City, the company started pre-Broadway tryouts in [[Philadelphia]] from March 2 to 21, 1964. Laurents, ignoring criticism about the show's message being trite and its absurdist style difficult to comprehend, poured his energies into restaging rather than dealing with the crux of the problem.\n\nThe show suffered further setbacks when supporting actor Henry Lascoe, who played Comptroller Schubb, suffered a heart attack during the show's out-of-town tryout, and was replaced by Gabriel Dell. According to Sondheim, \"Lansbury was so insecure onstage, and unhappy with her performance, that we considered replacing her. Ironically, it soon became apparent that it had been Lascoe, an old pro...who had made her feel like an amateur. The minute his much less confident understudy took over, she felt free to blossom, which she spectacularly did.\" Sondheim called the reviews \"humiliating\" and the audiences \"hostile.\" <ref>Sondheim, Stephen.

Scenic design was by [[William and Jean Eckart]], costume design by [[Theoni V. Aldredge]], and lighting design by [[Jules Fisher]]. [[Choreographer]] [[Herbert Ross]] received the show's sole [[Tony Award]] nomination.\n\nThe show became a cult favorite, and a truncated original cast recording released by [[Columbia Records]] sold well among Sondheim fans and musical theatre buffs. \"There Won't Be Trumpets,\" a song cut during previews, has become a favorite of [[cabaret]] performers.<ref>Citron, Stephen.

(Its former major industry was the production of an unidentified product that never wore out.  Everyone has one now, and no one needs a replacement.)  The only place in town doing good business is the local [[Sanatorium]], known as \u201cThe Cookie Jar,\u201d whose inmates look much healthier than the disgruntled townspeople. (\"I'm Like the Bluebird\")  All the money is in the hands of Cora Hoover Hooper, the stylish, ruthless mayoress and her cronies - Comptroller Schub, Treasurer Cooley, and Police Chief Magruder. Cora appears carried in a litter by her backup singers, and admits that she can accept anything except unpopularity (\u201cMe and My Town\u201d). The scheming Comptroller Schub tells her that he has a plan to save her administration, and the town, promising \u201cIt's highly unethical.\u201d He tells her to meet him at the rock on the edge of town.  At the rock, a local mother, Mrs. Schroeder, tries to tell her child, Baby Joan, to come down from the rock, when Baby Joan licks it - and a spring of water begins flowing from it. The town instantly proclaims a miracle, and Cora and her council eagerly anticipate tourist dollars as they boast of the water's curative powers. (\"Miracle Song\")  It is soon revealed to Cora that the miracle is a fake, controlled by a pump inside the rock.  The only person in town who doubts the miracle is Fay Apple, an eternally skeptical young nurse from the Cookie Jar who refuses to believe in miracles.  She appears at the rock with all forty-nine of the inmates, or \u201cCookies\u201d in tow, intending to let them take some of the water. Schub realizes that if they drink the water and do not change, people will discover the fake. As he tries to stop Fay, the inmates mingle with the townspeople, until no one can guess who is who. Fay disappears, and hiding from the police, admits that she hopes for one miracle - for a hero who can come and deliver the town from the madness (\u201cThere Won't Be Trumpets\u201d).  Cora arrives on the scene with the Cookie Jar's manager, Dr. Detmold, but he says that Fay has taken the records to identify the inmates. He tells Cora that he is expecting a new assistant who might help them. At that moment a mysterious stranger, J. Bowden Hapgood, arrives asking for directions to the Cookie Jar. He is instantly taken for the new assistant.  Asked to identify the missing Cookies, Hapgood begins questioning random people and sorting them into two groups, group A, and group one, but refuses to divulge which group is which.  The town council becomes suspicious of this and tries to force the truth out, but Hapgood questions them until they begin to doubt their own sanity. Cora is too caught up with his logic to care. (\u201cSimple\u201d) As the extended musical sequence ends, the lights black out except for a spotlight on Hapgood, who announces to the audience, \u201cYou are all mad!\u201d Seconds later, the stage lights are restored.  The stage set has vanished, and the cast is revealed in theater seats, holding programs, applauding the audience, as the act ends.\n\n===Act 2===\nAs act two opens, the two groups are now in bitter rivalry over who is the normal group (\u201cA-1 March\u201d) Another stranger, a French woman in a feathered coat appears.  It is really Fay Apple in disguise. She introduces herself as the Lady from Lourdes, a professional Miracle Inspector, come to investigate the miracle. As Schub runs off to warn Cora, Fay seeks out Hapgood in his hotel, and the two seduce each other in the style of a French romantic film. (\u201cCome Play Wiz Me\u201d) Fay tries to get Hapgood's help in exposing the miracle. Hapgood, however, sees through her disguise and wants to question her first.  Fay refuses to take her wig off, and confesses to him that this disguise, left over from a college play, is the only way she can break out of her rigid and cynical persona. She begins to hope, however, that Hapgood may be the one who can help her learn to be free. (\u201cAnyone Can Whistle\u201d) Meanwhile, the two groups continue to march, and Cora, trying to give a speech, realizes that Hapgood has stolen her limelight. (\u201cA Parade in Town\u201d) She and Schub plan an emergency meeting at her house.  Back at the hotel, Hapgood comes up with an idea, telling Fay to destroy the inmates' records. That way Fay can be free of them and they can stop pretending. When Fay is reluctant, Hapgood produces a record of his own - he is her fiftieth Cookie. He is a practicing idealist who, after years of attempted heroism, is tired of crusading and has come to the Cookie Jar to retire. Inspired by his record, Fay begins to tear the records up.  As she does, the Cookies appear and begin to dance (\u201cEverybody Says Don't\u201d).\n\n===Act 3===\nAct three begins with Cora at her house with her council. Schub has put the miracle on hiatus, but announces that they can easily turn the town against Hapgood by blaming him for it.  The group celebrates their alliance. (\u201cI've Got You to Lean On\u201d)  A mob quickly forms outside the hotel, and Hapgood and Fay, still disguised, take refuge under the rock. Discovering the fraud, Cora and the council confront them.  At that moment, Cora receives a telegram from the governor warning that if the quota of forty-nine cookies is not filled, she will be impeached. Schub tells her that since Hapgood never said who is normal or not, they can arrest anyone at random until the quota is filled.  Fay tries to get Hapgood to expose the miracle, but he warns her no one will believe it is a fake, because it works as a miracle should.  Fay wants his help stopping the Mayoress, but he refuses, since he is through with crusading. Although she knows she still isn't out of her shell, Fay angrily swears to go it alone. (\u201cSee What it Gets You\u201d) As Cora and the police force begin rounding up Cookies, Fay tries to get the key away from the guards in an extended ballet sequence. (\u201cThe Cookie Chase\u201d) As it ends, Fay is captured, and Dr. Detmold suddenly recognizes her. Fay tells the townspeople about the fake miracle, but the town refuses to believe her.  Detmold tells Cora that even without the records, Fay can identify the inmates from memory.  Cora warns that she will arrest forty-nine people, normal or not, and Fay, helplessly, identifies all the Cookies, except Hapgood.  She tells him the world needs people like him, and Hapgood can't turn himself in. He asks Fay to come with him, but she still can't bring herself to break free.  Parting ways, they reflect on what they briefly shared. (\u201cWith So Little to be Sure Of\u201d) Word comes of a new miracle, two towns over, of a statue with a warm heart. Soon the town is all but deserted, and Cora is again upstaged. Again, Schub has the answer - since the Cookie Jar is still successful, they can turn the entire town into one big Cookie Jar! Cora realizes she and Schub are meant for each other, and they dance off together. As Fay resumes work, Detmold's real new assistant arrives, and Fay is horrified to realize that she is even more practical, rigid and disbelieving than Fay herself, and the new nurse marches the Cookies off to the next town to disprove the new miracle. Horrified at seeing what she might become, Fay returns to the rock calling for Hapgood. When he doesn't answer, she tries to whistle - and succeeds in blowing a shrill, ugly whistle. Hapgood appears again, saying 'That's good enough for me.' As they embrace, the water begins flowing from the rock - a true miracle this time.

They tend to be [[sweetness|sweet]] and served in small [[bottle]]s (typically 355 ml (the normal size of a soda pop can) in the US, 275 ml in South Africa and Germany, 330 ml in Canada and Europe), and between 4% and 7% [[alcohol by volume|ABV]]. In Europe, Canada, and South Africa coolers tend to be pre-mixed spirits, including vodka (e.g. [[Smirnoff Ice]]) or rum (e.g. [[Bacardi Breezer]]). In the United States, on the other hand, alcopops often start out as [[hops|un-hopped]] [[beer]]s, depending on the state in which they are sold. Much of the malt (and alcohol) is removed (leaving mostly water), with subsequent addition of alcohol (usually vodka or grain alcohol), sugar, coloring and flavoring. Such drinks are legally classified as beers in virtually all states and can therefore be sold in outlets that do not or cannot carry spirit-based drinks. There are, however, stronger ones that ''are'' simply pre-mixed spirits (e.g. Bacardi Rum Island Iced Tea), often containing about 12.5% alcohol by volume, that can be sold only where hard liquor is available.\n\nIn the United States there is a proportionally limited tax on alcopops relative to those sold in Europe, although some states are considering legislation to bring their tax levels closer to the European model, which is credited with limiting consumption by youth.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nAccording to the US [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (TTB):\n\n<blockquote>Flavored malt beverages are brewery products that differ from traditional malt beverages such as beer, ale, lager, porter, stout, or malt liquor in several respects. Flavored malt beverages exhibit little or no traditional beer or malt beverage character. Their flavor is derived primarily from added flavors rather than from malt and other materials used in fermentation. At the same time, flavored malt beverages are marketed in traditional beer-type bottles and cans and distributed to the alcohol beverage market through beer and malt beverage wholesalers, and their alcohol content is similar to other malt beverages in the 4-6% alcohol by volume range.\n\nAlthough flavored malt beverages are produced at breweries, their method of production differs significantly from the production of other malt beverages and beer. In producing flavored malt beverages, brewers brew a fermented base of beer from malt and other brewing materials. Brewers then treat this base using a variety of processes in order to remove malt beverage character from the base. For example, they remove the color, bitterness, and taste generally associated with beer, ale, porter, stout, and other malt beverages. This leaves a base product to which brewers add various flavors, which typically contain distilled spirits, to achieve the desired taste profile and alcohol level.\n\nWhile the alcohol content of flavored malt beverages is similar to that of most traditional malt beverages, the alcohol in many of them is derived primarily from the distilled spirits component of the added flavors rather than from fermentation.\n:\u201470 Fed.

However, these beverages are based on traditional hopped beers and therefore not considered to be alcopops.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Bacardibreezer.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[Bacardi Breezer]]s]]\n\nWine coolers gained popularity in the US market in the 1980s when [[Bartles and Jaymes]] began advertising their brand of wine coolers, which were followed by other brands, including when [[Bacardi]] introduced the [[Bacardi Breezer|Breezer]].<ref>[http://www.distell.co.za/runtime/popcontentrun.aspx?pageidref=1900 General<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A growth in popularity occurred around 1993 with [[Two Dogs]], DNA Alcoholic Spring Water, [[Hooper's Hooch]] and [[Zima (drink)|Zima]], which was marketed under the title of \"malternative beverage.\" [[Wine coolers]] were on the decline due to the increase in the US federal wine tax, and using a malt-beverage base became the new industry standard. Later, [[Mike's Hard Lemonade]] was released in the United States, with humorous commercials depicting what they called \"violence against lemons\". [[Smirnoff]] also came out with another [[citrus]]-[[flavor]]ed [[malt beverage]] in the United States in the late 1990s called [[Smirnoff Ice]], which promoted itself with flashy commercials, usually involving trendy young people dancing in unlikely situations and places. (In the UK, Smirnoff Ice is marketed by [[Diageo]] as a PPS.){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nSome{{who|date=March 2018}} have expressed concern that such drinks might appeal to children as they tend to be sweet and brightly colored. Many [[Alcohol advertising|cooler advertising campaigns]] have been criticized as trying to make 'alcopops' appeal to young drinkers. In the United Kingdom, that led to a media outcry during the mid-1990s as the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] press associated alcopops with under-age drinking which damaged sales and would lead to [[off-licence]]s withdrawing them from their stores.\nIn response to a complaint from the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] (CSPI), the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) conducted an extensive investigation in 2001. The agency \"found no evidence of intent to target minors with the FMB products, packaging, or advertising. Furthermore, after reviewing the consumer survey evidence submitted by CSPI in support of the proposition that FMBs were predominantly popular with minors, the FTC concluded that flaws in the survey's methodology limited the ability to draw conclusions from the survey data.\"\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission again in 2003 investigated FMB ads, [[product placement]], and internal company marketing documents after a directive from the conferees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. \"The Commission's investigation found no evidence of targeting underage consumers in the marketing of FMBs. Adults 21 to 29 appear to be the intended target of FMB marketing\"<ref>Federal Trade Commission.

[[Germany]] has imposed an extra duty of 0.80 to 0.90 [[euro]] per bottle effective August 1, 2004. To circumvent higher taxation, some German producers have switched to [[wine coolers]], which are being marketed the same way. Some bottles now carry a warning stating that they are not for consumption by people under the legal drinking age (under 18 in the UK and 21 in the United States). On May 11, 2008, the [[Australia]]n Government increased the excise tax on alcopops by 70%, to bring it in line with the tax on spirits. There is the concern this tax will encourage consumers to buy straight spirits and mix the drinks themselves,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} possibly resulting in drinks with a higher alcohol concentration than the premixed alternatives. This tax was revoked during March 2009 meaning the government had to pay back the 290 million collected on the tax.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/alcopops-price-to-drop-after-bill-defeat/story-e6frf7jo-1111119172860 |title=Alcopops tax defeated in the Senate after second vote |first=Gerard |last=McManus |agency=AAP |work=Herald Sun |date=March 18, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission report states, \"Further, industry-conducted research on consumers over the age of 21 who use FMBs shows that these consumers generally view the FMBs as substitutes for beer, ...

This had two implications: The most common alcopops, such as [[Smirnoff Ice]] or [[Bacardi Breezer]], were nearly taken off the market, while other manufacturers changed the recipes of their drinks to replace spirit alcohols with wine or beer, but with the same [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]], enabling these mixed drinks (which are not \"alcopops\" under German law) to be sold legally to minors 16 and 17 years of age.\n\n=== South Africa ===\nIn South Africa, \"spirit coolers\" cannot be sold to persons under the age of 18.

An alkali also can be defined as a base that dissolves in [[water]]. A solution of a soluble base has a [[pH]] greater than 7.0. The [[adjective]] '''alkaline''' is commonly, and  '''alkalescent''' less often, used in [[English language|English]] as a [[synonym]] for basic, especially for bases soluble in water. This broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the [[acid-base reaction theories#Arrhenius theory|Arrhenius]] definition of a base, and they are still among the most common bases.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"alkali\" is derived from Arabic ''al qal\u012by'' (or ''alkali''),<ref name=\"autogenerated148\">{{cite book|title=[[Chambers's encyclopaedia]]: a dictionary of universal knowledge, Volume 1|publisher=J.B. Lippincott & Co|year=1888|page=148}}</ref> meaning ''the calcined ashes'' (see [[calcination]]), referring to the original source of alkaline substances. A water-extract of burned plant ashes, called [[potash]] and composed mostly of potassium carbonate, was mildly basic. After heating this substance with [[calcium hydroxide]] (''slaked lime''), a far more strongly basic substance known as ''caustic potash'' ([[potassium hydroxide]]) was produced. Caustic potash was traditionally used in conjunction with animal fats to produce soft [[soap]]s, one of the caustic processes that rendered soaps from fats in the process of [[saponification]], one known since antiquity. Plant potash lent the name to the element [[potassium]], which was first derived from caustic potash, and also gave potassium its chemical symbol '''K''' (from the German name Kalium), which ultimately derived from al'''k'''ali.\n\n==Common properties of alkalis and bases==\nAlkalis are all Arrhenius bases, ones which form hydroxide ions (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) when dissolved in water. Common properties of alkaline aqueous [[solution]]s include:\n* Moderately concentrated solutions (over 10<sup>\u22123</sup> M) have a pH of 7.1 or greater. This means that they will turn [[phenolphthalein]] from colorless to pink.\n* Concentrated solutions are [[Caustic (substance)|caustic]] (causing chemical burns).\n* Alkaline solutions are slippery or soapy to the touch, due to the [[saponification]] of the fatty substances on the surface of the skin.\n* Alkalis are normally [[solubility|water-soluble]], although some like [[barium carbonate]] are only soluble when reacting with an acidic aqueous solution.\n\n==Difference between alkali and base==\nThe terms \"base\" and \"alkali\" are often used interchangeably, particularly outside the context of [[chemistry]] and [[chemical engineering]].\n\nThere are various more specific definitions for the concept of an alkali. Alkalis are usually defined as a subset of the bases. One of two subsets is commonly chosen.\n* A basic salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=alkali Alkali | Define Alkali at Dictionary.com].

These soils can occur naturally, due to the presence of alkali salts. Although many plants do prefer slightly basic soil (including vegetables like [[cabbage]] and fodder like [[buffalo grass]]), most plants prefer a mildly acidic soil (with pHs between 6.0 and 6.8), and [[alkaline soil]]s can cause problems.<ref name=\"autogenerated148\"/>\n\n==Alkali lakes==\n\nIn [[Soda lake|alkali lake]]s (also called ''soda lakes''), evaporation concentrates the naturally occurring carbonate salts, giving rise to an alkalic and often saline lake.\n\nExamples of alkali lakes:\n*[[Alkali Lake (Oregon)|Alkali Lake]], [[Lake County, Oregon]] \n*[[Baldwin Lake (San Bernardino County, California)|Baldwin Lake]], [[San Bernardino County, California]]\n*[[Mono Lake]], near [[Owens Valley]] in [[California]]\n*[[Redberry Lake, Saskatchewan]] <!-- Not Blueberry lake, ref see http://www.pnr-rpn.ec.gc.ca/nature/whp/sanctuaries/dc01s12.en.html -->\n*[[Summer Lake (Oregon)|Summer Lake]], [[Lake County, Oregon]]\n*[[Tramping Lake, Saskatchewan]]\n*[[Lake Magadi]] in Kenya\n*[[Lake Turkana]] in [[Kenya]] (the largest alkali lake in the world)\n* There are also alkali lakes in the outback of [[Australia]].\n* [[Bear Lake (Idaho\u2013Utah)|Bear Lake]]<ref>Davis, Jim and Milligan, Mark (2011).

Hooks examines the effect of [[racism]] and [[sexism]] on black women, the [[civil right]]s movement, and [[feminist]] movements from [[suffrage]] to the 1970s. She argues that the convergence of sexism and racism during slavery contributed to black women having the lowest status and worst conditions of any group in American society. White female [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and suffragists were often more comfortable with black male abolitionists such as [[Frederick Douglass]], while southern [[Racial segregation|segregationalists]] and stereotypes of black [[female promiscuity]] and immorality caused protests whenever black women spoke. Hooks points out that these white female reformers were more concerned with white morality than the conditions these morals caused black Americans.<ref name=debate>{{cite web|title=Ain't I a Woman? |url=http://www.debate.org/reference/aint-i-a-woman |publisher=debate.org |accessdate=11 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111190336/http://www.debate.org/reference/aint-i-a-woman |archivedate=11 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\nFurther, she argues that the stereotypes that were set during slavery still affect black women today. She argued that slavery allowed white society to [[stereotype]] white women as the pure goddess [[virgin]] and move black women to the seductive whore stereotype formerly placed on all women, thus justifying the devaluation of black femininity and rape of black women. The work which black women have been forced to perform, either in slavery or in a discriminatory workplace, that would be non-gender conforming for white women has been used against black women as a proof of their emasculating behaviour. bell hooks argues that [[black nationalism]] was largely a patriarchal and [[misogynist]] movement, seeking to overcome racial divisions by strengthening sexist ones, and that it readily latched onto the idea of the emasculating black ''[[matriarch]]'' proposed by [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], whose theories bell hooks often criticizes.\n\nMeanwhile, she says, the \"feminist movement\", a largely white middle and upper class affair, did not articulate the needs of poor and non-white women, thus reinforcing sexism, racism, and [[classism]]. She suggests this explains the low numbers of black women who participated in the feminist movement in the 1970s, pointing to [[Louis Harris]]' [[Virginia Slims]] poll done in 1972 for [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] that she says showed 62 percent of black women supported \"efforts to change women's status\" and 67 percent \"sympathized with the women's rights movement\", compared with 45 and 35 percent of white women (also Steinem, 1972). <!-- Please verify the quoted sections are the exact phrasing of the survey. -->\n\nThe book is commonly used in gender studies, Black studies, and philosophy courses.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Black feminism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ain't I A Woman?

AMOS BASIC was published by [[Europress Software]] and originally written by [[Fran\u00e7ois Lionet]] with [[Constantin Sotiropoulos]].\n\n== History ==\nAMOS is a descendant of [[STOS BASIC]] for the [[Atari ST]]. AMOS BASIC was first produced in 1990.\n\nAMOS competed on the Amiga platform with Acid Software's [[Blitz BASIC]]. Both BASICs differed from other dialects on different platforms, in that they allowed the easy creation of fairly demanding multimedia software, with full structured code and many high-level functions to load images, animations, sounds and display them in various ways.\n\nThe original AMOS version was [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] which, whilst working fine, suffered the same disadvantage of any language being run interpretively. By all accounts, AMOS was extremely fast among interpreted languages. The language was fast enough that an extension called AMOS 3D could produce playable 3D games even on plain 7&nbsp;MHz Amigas. Later, an AMOS [[compiler]] was developed that further increased speed.\n\nAMOS could also include inline Assembly Language.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/1990-lionet-francois-amos-the-creator-user-guide/1990-lionet-francois-amos-the-creator-user-guide_djvu.txt The Creator], by Frangois Lionet, 1990, ''\"AMOS Basic includes special facilities which allow you to combine assembly language routines with your Basic programs.\"''</ref>\n\nTo simplify animation of sprites, AMOS included the AMOS Animation Language (AMAL), a compiled sprite scripting language which runs independently of the main AMOS BASIC program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grove.ufl.edu/~cwarner/computers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208051702/http://grove.ufl.edu/~cwarner/computers.html |archivedate=2010-12-08 |df= }}</ref> It was also possible to control screen and \"rainbow\" effects using AMAL scripts. AMAL scripts in effect created CopperLists, small routines executed by the Amiga's Agnus chip.\n\nAfter the original version of AMOS, Europress released a compiler ('''AMOS Compiler'''), and two other versions of the language: '''Easy AMOS''', a simpler version for beginners, and '''AMOS Professional''', a more advanced version with added features, such as a better [[Integrated development environment|IDE]], [[ARexx]] support, a new [[user interface|UI]] API and new [[control flow|flow control constructs]]. Neither of these new versions was significantly more popular than the original AMOS.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012|reason=For example, from my experience it was way more popular. References to sales figures or alike would be nice.}}\n\nAMOS was mostly used to make multimedia software, [[video game]]s (platformers and graphical adventures) and educational software.\n\nThe language was mildly successful within the Amiga community. Its ease of use made it especially attractive to beginners.\n\nPerhaps AMOS BASIC's biggest disadvantage, stemming from its Atari ST lineage, was its incompatibility with the Amiga's [[AmigaOS|operating system]] functions and interfaces. Instead, AMOS BASIC controlled the computer directly, which caused programs written in it to have a non-standard user interface, and also caused compatibility problems with newer versions of the operating system.\n\nToday the language has declined in popularity along with the Amiga computer for which it was written. Despite this, a small community of enthusiasts are still using it. The [[source code]] to AMOS was released around 2001 under a [[BSD licenses|BSD style license]] by [[Clickteam]] - a company that includes the original programmer.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071130053321/http://clickteam.com/eng/downloadcenter.php?i=58 Amos & Stos \u00bb Main Download] on clickteam.com (archived 2007)</ref>\n\n== Software ==\nSoftware written using AMOS BASIC includes:\n\n* ''[[Miggybyte]]''\n* ''[[Scorched Tanks]]''\n* Games by [[Vulcan Software]], amongst which was the ''[[Valhalla: Before the War|Valhalla]]'' trilogy\n* Amiga version of ''[[Ultimate Domain]]'' (called ''[[Genesia (game)|Genesia]]'') by [[Micro\u00efds]]\n* ''[[Flight of the Amazon Queen]]'', by [[Interactive Binary Illusions]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/blogs/JohnPassfield/20150601/244740/Making_of_Flight_of_the_Amazon_Queen__A_20th_Anniversary_Retrospective.php|title=Making of Flight of the Amazon Queen: A 20th Anniversary Retrospective |accessdate=1 January 2016|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]}}</ref>\n* ''[[Extreme Violence]]'', included on an [[Amiga Power]] cover disk\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130530022407/http://www.pianetaamiga.it/ Source code for AMOS Professional] 68000 ASM from pianetaamiga.it (archived, [https://web.archive.org/web/20151031001644/http://www.pianetaamiga.it/downloads/AMOSPro_Sources.zip ZIP])\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071130053321/http://clickteam.com/eng/downloadcenter.php?i=58 Source code for AMOS and STOS] 68000 ASM from clickteam.com (archived, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120207175110/http://www.clickteam.com/webftp/files/2/5/AMOSCompiler.zip ZIP])\n* [http://www.ultimateamiga.co.uk/index.php/page,16/ The AMOS Factory] (an AMOS support/community site)\n* [http://www.amigacoding.com Amigacoding website] (contains in-depth info and references for AMOS)\n* [http://www.triumphoverchallenges.com/stos-and-amos-game-creators/ History of STOS and AMOS]: how they came to be published in the UK\n* [https://www.facebook.com/groups/AmosPro/ Amos Professional group on Facebook] (one of the members is AMOS' original developer Fran\u00e7ois Lionet)\n\n{{AmigaOS}}\n{{BASIC}}\n\n[[Category:BASIC programming language family]]\n[[Category:Video game development software]]\n[[Category:Amiga development software]]", "sha1": "qt7s75qjg0gmw1r97dsxfibqbyurx36"}}, {"title": "Arcadia 2001", "ns": "0", "id": "2959", "revision": {"id": "866670323", "parentid": "866639031", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T19:54:42Z", "contributor": {"username": "ObiKKa", "id": "31107910"}, "comment": "/* External links */ Added few entry links.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox information appliance\n| name         = Arcadia 2001\n| title        = \n| aka          = \n| logo         = \n| image        = Emerson-Arcadia-2001.jpg\n| caption      = Emerson Arcadia 2001 video game console\n| developer    = \n| manufacturer = [[Emerson Radio]]\n| family       = \n| type         = [[Home video game console]]\n| generation   = [[History of video game consoles (second generation)|Second generation]]\n| releasedate  = {{Start date and age|May 1982}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Forster |first=Winnie |authorlink=Winnie Forster |title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds & home computers 1972 - 2005 |year=2005 |publisher=GAMEPLAN |isbn=3-00-015359-4|pages=57}}</ref>\n| lifespan     = 18 months\n| price        = \n| discontinued = 1984\n| unitssold    = \n| unitsshipped = \n| media        = [[ROM cartridge]]\n| os           = \n| power        = 12-volt\n| soc          = \n| cpu          = [[Signetics 2650]]\n| memory       = 1 KB RAM\n| storage      = \n| memory card  =\n| display      = \n| graphics     = 128 \u00d7 208 / 128 \u00d7 104, 8 Colours\n| sound        = \n| input        = \n| controllers  = 2 x [[Intellivision]]-style controller (12 button keypad and 'fire' buttons on the sides)\n| camera       = \n| touchpad     = \n| connectivity = \n| platform     = \n| service      = \n| dimensions   = \n| weight       = \n| topgame      = \n| compatibility= \n| predecessor  = \n| successor    = \n| related      = \n| website      = <!--{{URL|example.org}}-->\n}}\n\n'''Arcadia 2001''' is a second-generation [[8-bit]] console released by [[Emerson Radio]] in May 1982, several months before the release of [[ColecoVision]].

He found the 1905 paper, which listed 25, had 1 wrong, and [[Convex uniform honeycomb#Nonwythoffian forms (gyrated and elongated)|4 being missing]]. Gr\u00fcnbaum states in this paper that Norman Johnson deserves priority for achieving the same enumeration in 1991. He also mentions that [[I. Alexeyev]] of Russia had contacted him regarding a putative enumeration of these forms, but that Gr\u00fcnbaum was unable to verify this at the time.\n* '''2006''': George Olshevsky, in his manuscript ''Uniform Panoploid Tetracombs'', along with repeating the derived list of 11 convex uniform tilings, and 28 convex uniform honeycombs, expands a further derived list of 143 convex uniform tetracombs (Honeycombs of [[uniform 4-polytope]]s in 4-space).\n\nOnly 14 of the convex uniform polyhedra appear in these patterns:\n* three of the five [[Platonic solid]]s,\n* six of the thirteen [[Archimedean solid]]s, and\n* five of the infinite family of [[prism (geometry)|prism]]s.\n\n=== Names ===\nThis set can be called the '''regular and semiregular honeycombs'''. It has been called the '''Archimedean honeycombs''' by analogy with the convex uniform (non-regular) polyhedra, commonly called [[Archimedean solid]]s. Recently [[John Horton Conway|Conway]] has suggested naming the set as the '''Architectonic tessellations''' and the dual honeycombs as the '''[[Catoptric tessellation]]s'''.\n\nThe individual honeycombs are listed with names given to them by [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]]. (Some of the terms used below are defined in [[Uniform 4-polytope#Geometric derivations for 46 nonprismatic Wythoffian uniform 4-polytopes]])\n\nFor cross-referencing, they are given with list indices from '''A'''ndreini (1-22), '''W'''illiams(1-2,9-19), '''J'''ohnson (11-19, 21-25, 31-34, 41-49, 51-52, 61-65), and '''G'''r\u00fcnbaum(1-28).

Nearly 2000 years later, in his book ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] also argued assassination could be useful.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} An army and even a nation might be based upon and around a [[cult of personality|particularly strong, canny, or charismatic leader]], whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war.\n\nFor similar and additional reasons, assassination has also sometimes been used in the conduct of [[foreign policy]].  The costs and benefits of such actions are difficult to compute, especially when they depend upon the policies of a successor, and one study has found that perceptual biases held by leaders often negatively affect decision making in this area, such that decisions made to go forward with assassinations often reflect the vague hope that any successor might be better.<ref name=\"iraja\">{{cite journal | title=Decision Making in Using Assassinations in International Relations | url=http://www.psqonline.org/article.cfm?IDArticle=19545 | journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]] | volume=131| issue=3 | date=Fall 2016 | pages= 503\u2013539 | last=Schilling | first=Warner R. | authorlink=Warner R.

Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, this possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian [[Alcibiades]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. A number of additional examples from [[World War II]] show how assassination was used as a tool:\n\n* The [[Operation Anthropoid|assassination of Reinhard Heydrich]] in Prague on May 27, 1942 by the British and Czechoslovak government-in-exile.  This case illustrates the difficulty of comparing the benefits of a foreign policy goal (strengthening the legitimacy and influence of the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] in London) against the possible costs resulting from an assassination (the [[Lidice massacre]]).<ref name=\"iraja\"/>\n* The American interception of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plane during World War II, after his travel route had been decrypted.\n* [[Operation Gaff]] was a planned British commando raid to capture or kill the German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] (also known as \"The Desert Fox\").<ref name=\"Skor\">''Commando Extraordinary'' \u2013 Foley, Charles; Legion for the Survival of Freedom, 1992, page 155</ref>\n\nUse of assassination has continued in more recent conflicts:\n* During the [[Vietnam War]], partly in response to [[Viet Cong]] assassinations of government leaders, the U.S. engaged in the [[Phoenix Program]] to assassinate Viet Cong leaders and sympathizers, and killed between 6,000 and 41,000 people, with official 'targets' of 1,800 per month. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===As tool of insurgents===\nInsurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.\n\nThe [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919\u201321 killed many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit \u2013 [[The Squad (IRA unit)|the Squad]] \u2013 for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920.\n\nThis tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland (1969\u20131998). Killing of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and assassination of RUC politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969\u20131997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] by [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing the Conservative Party Conference]] in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.\n\n[[Basque people|Basque]] terrorists [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in Spain have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably the President of the Government of Spain [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them.\n\nThe [[Red Brigades]] in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIn the [[Vietnam War]], Communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem]] regime to collapse before the U.S. intervention.<ref>''Viet Cong'' \u2013 Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday December 16, 1970</ref>\n\n==Psychology==\nA major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of 'impulsive' action.<ref name=\"SS\"/>\n\nHowever, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be [[delusion]]al, a figure that rose to 60% with 'near-lethal approachers' (people apprehended before reaching their target). This shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-age assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempt. The report also found that around two-thirds of attackers had previously been arrested (not necessarily for related offenses), that 44% had a history of serious depression, and that 39% had a history of substance abuse.<ref name=\"SS\"/>\n\n==Techniques==\n\n===Modern methods===\n\nWith the advent of effective [[ranged weaponry]], and later [[firearm]]s, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. [[Bodyguard]]s were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Moreover, the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances of an assassin's survival.  The first heads of government to be assassinated with a firearm were the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Regent Moray of Scotland]] in 1570, and [[William the Silent]], the Prince of Orange of the Netherlands in 1584. [[Gunpowder]] and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch.\n\nExplosives, especially the [[car bomb]], become far more common in modern history, with [[grenade]]s and remote-triggered [[land mine]]s also used, especially in the Middle East and Balkans (the initial attempt on [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]'s life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG) has become a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles,<ref>''[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/17/mideast.violence/index.html Hamas leader killed in Israeli airstrike]'' \u2013 [[CNN]], Saturday April 17, 2004</ref> as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.\n\n[[File:Oswaldrifle.jpg|thumb|Rifle of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the assassin of President [[John F. Kennedy]]]]\n[[File:Booth deringer.jpg|thumb|[[Derringer]] of [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\nA [[sniper]] with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, certain difficulties attend long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line-of-sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim's travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, usually measured in hundreds of meters. A dedicated [[sniper rifle]] is also expensive, often costing thousands of dollars because of the high level of precision machining and hand-finishing required to achieve extreme accuracy.<ref name=\"Austria\">''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1542559/Iraqi-insurgents-using-Austrian-rifles-from-Iran.html Iraqi insurgents using Austrian rifles from Iran]'' \u2013 [[The Daily Telegraph]], Tuesday February 13, 2007</ref>\n\nDespite their comparative disadvantages, [[handgun]]s are more easily concealable, and consequentially much more commonly used than rifles. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, 15% used knives, and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).<ref name=\"SS\"/>\n\nIn the case of state-sponsored assassination, poisoning can be more easily denied. [[Georgi Markov]], a [[Bulgaria]]n dissident was assassinated by [[ricin]] poisoning. A tiny pellet containing the poison was injected into his leg through a specially designed [[Bulgarian umbrella|umbrella]]. Widespread allegations involving the Bulgarian government and [[KGB]] have not led to any legal results. However, after the fall of the USSR, it was learned that the KGB had developed an umbrella that could inject ricin pellets into a victim, and two former KGB agents who defected said the agency assisted in the murder.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/story/2007/01/070117_markov.shtml The case of the poisoned umbrella].

Bodyguards act as a shield for the potential target, keeping lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a parade route), and putting themselves in harm's way\u2014both by simple presence, showing that physical force is available to protect the target,<ref name=\"SS\">''[http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf Assassination in the United States: An Operational Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620171200/http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf |date=June 20, 2006 }}'' \u2013 Fein, Robert A. & Vossekuil, Brian, ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', Volume 44, Number 2, March 1999</ref><ref>[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html Lincoln] \u2013 Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> and by shielding the target during any attack. To neutralize an attacker, bodyguards are typically armed as much as legal and practical concerns permit.\n\nNotable examples of bodyguards include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|Janissaries]]\u2014though, in both cases, the protectors sometimes became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage or killing the very leaders they were supposed to protect. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties led to the assassination of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], assassinated by two [[Sikh]] bodyguards in 1984.\n\nThis bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading assassins to attempt stealthy means, such as [[poison]] (which risk was answered by having [[food taster|another person taste the leader's food]] first).\n\nAnother notable measure is the use of a [[political decoy|body double]], a person who looks like the leader and who pretends to be the leader to draw attention away from the intended target.\n\n===Modern strategies===\n[[File:Reagan assassination attempt 4 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]\nWith the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a small army trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.\n\nAs the 20th century dawned, the prevalence and capability of assassins grew quickly, as did measures to protect against them. For the first time, [[Armored car (VIP)|armored cars or limousines]] were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions virtually invulnerable to [[small arms]] fire, smaller bombs and [[Land mine|mines]].<ref>''[http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php How to choose the appropriate bulletproof cars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103071805/http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php |date=January 3, 2007 }}'' (from Alpha-armouring.com website, includes examples of protection levels available)</ref> [[Bulletproof vest]]s also began to be used, which were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected  \u2013 so they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events, if at all.\n\nAccess to famous persons, too, became more and more restricted;<ref name=\"Report\">[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html The Need For Protection Further Demonstrated] \u2013 Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as communication became better and information technology more prevalent, it has become all but impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of [[metal detector|metal]] and [[Bomb disposal|bomb detectors]].\n\nMost modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during transport, both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] and former [[Pakistan]]i Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]], or as part of [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coups d'\u00e9tat]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Patrice Lumumba]].\n\n[[File:Popemobil Mai 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] in a modified [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]] [[Popemobile]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], Brazil]]\nThe methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[Popemobile]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], built following an attempt at his life. Politicians often resent this need for separation, sometimes sending their bodyguards away from them for personal or publicity reasons; U.S. President [[William McKinley]] did this at the public reception where he was assassinated.<ref name=\"Report\"/>\n\nOther potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as writer [[Salman Rushdie]]. A related form of protection is the use of [[political decoy|body doubles]], people with similar builds to those they are expected to impersonate. These persons are then [[makeup|made up]], and in some cases [[plastic surgery|altered]] to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high risk situations.  According to Joe R. Reeder, Under Secretary of the Army from 1993 to 1997, [[Fidel Castro]] used body doubles.<ref name=\"FOX\">{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |title=It's Bin Laden&nbsp;... or Is It? |publisher= [[Fox News]] |date=December 20, 2001 |first=Catherine |last=Donaldson-Evans}}</ref>\n\n[[United States Secret Service]] protective agents receive training in the psychology of assassins.<ref>{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Pelley |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/03/14/60II/main171812.shtml |title=Mind of the Assassin |publisher= CBS 60&nbsp;Minutes II |date=August 15, 2000 |accessdate= March 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Assassinations in fiction]]\n* [[Contract killing]]\n* [[History of assassination]]\n* [[List of assassinations]]\n* [[List of people who survived assassination attempts]]\n* [[List of assassinated and executed heads of state and government]]\n* [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots]]\n* [[Special Activities Division]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]\n* [[Firearms by assassination]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Clarke |first=James W. |year=2006 |title=Defining Danger: American Assassins and the New Domestic Terrorists}}\n* {{cite book |last=Clarke |first=James W. |date=January 28, 2011 |title=America's History of Crazy Political Assassins Didn't Begin with Loughner|publisher=History News Network'}}\n* {{cite book |last=Porter |first=Lindsay |title=Assassination: a History of Political Murder |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]]  |year=2010}} [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/7545208/Assassination-A-History-of-Political-Murder-by-Lindsay-Porter.html Review] [[The Daily Telegraph]], April 3, 2010.\n* {{cite book| chapter=Section B.

The WHO calls ''alcoholism'' \"a term of long-standing use and variable meaning\", and use of the term was disfavored by a 1979 WHO expert committee. ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|The Big Book]]'' (from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]) states that once a person is an alcoholic, they are always an alcoholic, but does not define what is meant by the term ''alcoholic'' in this context. In 1960, [[Bill W.]], co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), said:\n:We have never called alcoholism a [[disease]] because, technically speaking, it is not a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as [[heart disease]]. Instead there are many separate heart ailments, or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. We did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. We always called it an [[illness]], or a [[malady]]\u2014a far safer term for us to use.<ref name=\"McGovernWhite2003\">{{Cite book|first1=Thomas F.|last1= McGovern|first2=William L. |last2=White|title=Alcohol Problems in the United States: Twenty Years of Treatment Perspective|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=3gRwmYohuooC|page=7}}|accessdate=17 April 2010|date=20 May 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7890-2049-9|pages=7\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn professional and research contexts, the term \"alcoholism\" sometimes encompasses both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000002709|alcoholism}}</ref> and sometimes is considered equivalent to alcohol dependence.

He looks at this in four phases. The first two are considered \"normal\" drinking and the last two are viewed as \"typical\" alcoholic drinking.<ref name=Thomb1999/> Johnson's four phases consist of:\n# Learning the mood swing. A person is introduced to alcohol (in some cultures this can happen at a relatively young age), and the person enjoys the happy feeling it produces.  At this stage, there is no emotional cost.\n# Seeking the mood swing. A person will drink to regain that feeling of euphoria experienced in phase 1; the drinking will increase as more intoxication is required to achieve the same effect. Again at this stage, there are no significant consequences.\n# At the third stage there are physical and social consequences, i.e., hangovers, family problems, work problems, etc. A person will continue to drink excessively, disregarding the problems.\n# The fourth stage can be detrimental, as Johnson cites it as a risk for premature death. As a person now drinks to feel normal, they block out the feelings of overwhelming guilt, remorse, anxiety, and shame they experience when sober.<ref name=Thomb1999/>\n\n====Milam & Ketcham's physical deterioration stages====\nOther theorists such as Milam & Ketcham (1983) focus on the physical deterioration that alcohol consumption causes. They describe the process in three stages:\n# Adaptive stage \u2013 The person will not experience any negative symptoms, and they believe they have the capacity for drinking alcohol without problems. Physiological changes are happening with the increase in tolerance, but this will not be noticeable to the drinker or others.\n# Dependent stage \u2013 At this stage, symptoms build up gradually. [[Hangover]] symptoms from excessive drinking may be confused with withdrawal symptoms. Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently. They will try to hide their drinking problem from others and will avoid gross intoxication.\n# Deterioration stage \u2013 Various organs are damaged due to long-term drinking. Medical treatment in a rehabilitation center will be required; otherwise, the pathological changes will cause death.\n\n====DSM and ICD====\nIn psychology and psychiatry, the DSM is the most common global standard, while in medicine, the standard is ICD.

Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based [[zero tolerance]] approach; however, some prefer a [[Harm reduction|harm-reduction]] approach.<ref name=\"Gabbard\"/>\n\n===Detoxification===\n{{Main|Alcohol detoxification}}\n[[Alcohol detoxification]] or 'detox' for alcoholics is an abrupt stop of alcohol drinking coupled with the substitution of drugs, such as [[benzodiazepines]], that have similar effects to prevent [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]].

Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome as well as those who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients.

Dependence upon and withdrawal from sedative-hypnotics can be medically severe and, as with alcohol withdrawal, there is a risk of [[psychosis]] or [[seizure]]s if not properly managed.<ref name=\"dolpdaa\">{{cite journal | last1 = Johansson |first1=BA |last2=Berglund |first2=M |last3=Hanson |first3=M |last4=P\u00f6hl\u00e9n |first4=C |last5=Persson |first5=I | title = Dependence on legal psychotropic drugs among alcoholics | journal = Alcohol and Alcoholism. | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 613\u20138 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14633651 | doi = 10.1093/alcalc/agg123 | url = http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/6/613 | format = PDF | issn = 0735-0414 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090220090248/http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/6/613 | archivedate = 20 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Epidemiology==\n[[File:Alcohol use disorders world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Disability-adjusted life year]] for alcohol use disorders per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants in 2004.\n{{refbegin|3}}\n{{legend|#b3b3b3|no data}}\n{{legend|#ffff65|<50}}\n{{legend|#fff200|50-170}}\n{{legend|#ffdc00|170-290}}\n{{legend|#ffc600|290-410}}\n{{legend|#ffb000|410-530}}\n{{legend|#ff9a00|530-650}}\n{{legend|#ff8400|650-770}}\n{{legend|#ff6e00|770-890}}\n{{legend|#ff5800|890-1010}}\n{{legend|#ff4200|1010-1130}}\n{{legend|#ff2c00|1130\u20131250}}\n{{legend|#cb0000|>1250}}\n{{refend}}]]\n[[File:Alcohol by country.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Total recorded yearly [[countries by alcohol consumption|alcohol per capita consumption]] (15+), in litres of pure alcohol<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msbgsruprofiles.pdf |title=Global Status Report on Alcohol 2004 |first=Catherine |last=Le Gal\u00e8s-Camus |isbn=978-92-4-156272-0 |year=2004 |publisher=World Health Organization |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308041347/http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msbgsruprofiles.pdf |archivedate=8 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\n\nThe [[World Health Organization]] estimates that as of 2010 there are 208 million people with alcoholism worldwide (4.1% of the population over 15 years of age).<ref name=WHO2014/><ref name=Pew2015/> Substance use disorders are a major [[public health]] problem facing many countries. \"The most common substance of abuse/dependence in patients presenting for treatment is alcohol.\"<ref name=\"Gabbard\">{{Cite book| last1 = Gabbard | first1 = Glen O. | title = Treatments of psychiatric disorders | year = 2001 | publisher = American Psychiatric Press | location = Washington, DC | url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=hLVrAAAAMAAJ}} |edition=3| isbn = 978-0-88048-910-2 }}</ref> In the [[United Kingdom]], the number of 'dependent drinkers' was calculated as over 2.8 million in 2001.<ref name=\"cosu\">{{Cite web |url=http://sia.dfc.unifi.it/costi%20uk.pdf |title=Alcohol misuse: How much does it cost?

Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of alcohol in the United States]], a nationwide constitutional ban on the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages that remained in place until 1933.

Langer]] (1953), ''Feeling and Form: a theory of art developed from Philosophy in a New Key'' p. 90: \"[[Sculpture|Sculptural form]] is a powerful abstraction from actual objects and the three-dimensional space which we construe ... through [[sensory system|touch and sight]].\"</ref>\n\nConceptual abstractions may be formed by filtering the [[information]] content of a [[concept]] or an observable [[phenomenon]],  selecting only the aspects which are relevant for a particular subjectively valued purpose. For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a [[ball]] selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, excluding, but not eliminating, the other phenomenal and cognitive characteristics of that particular ball.<ref name=Langer/> In a [[type\u2013token distinction]], a type (e.g., a 'ball') is more abstract than its tokens (e.g., 'that leather soccer ball').\n\nAbstraction in its secondary use is a [[#Material process|material process]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Alfred Sohn-Rethel, ''Intellectual and manual labour: A critique of epistemology'', Humanities Press, 1977</ref> discussed in the [[#Themes|themes below]].\n\n==Origins==\nThinking in abstractions is considered by [[anthropologist]]s, [[archaeologist]]s, and [[sociologist]]s to be one of the key traits in [[modern human behaviour]], which is believed to have developed between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. Its development is likely to have been closely connected with the development of human  [[language]], which (whether spoken or written) appears to both involve and facilitate abstract thinking.\n\n===History===\n''Abstraction'' involves induction of ideas or the synthesis of particular facts into one general theory about something. It is the opposite of ''specification'', which is the analysis or breaking-down of a general idea or abstraction into concrete facts. Abstraction can be illustrated with [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620), a book of modern scientific philosophy written in the late [[Elizabethan era]]<ref name=\"Hesse\">Hesse, M. B. (1964), \"Francis Bacon's Philosophy of Science\", in A Critical History of Western Philosophy, ed. D. J. O'Connor, New York, pp. 141\u201352.</ref> of England to encourage modern thinkers to collect specific facts before making any generalizations.\n\nBacon used and promoted [[inductive reasoning|induction]] as an abstraction tool, and it countered the ancient [[deductive]]-thinking approach that had dominated the intellectual world since the times of Greek philosophers like [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Aristotle]]. Thales (c. 624\u2013546 BCE) believed that everything in the universe comes from one main substance, water. He deduced or specified from a general idea, \"everything is water\", to the specific forms of water such as ice, snow, fog, and rivers.\n\nModern scientists can also use the opposite approach of abstraction, or going from particular facts collected into one general idea, such as the motion of the planets ([[Isaac Newton|Newton]] (1642\u20131727)). When determining that the sun is the center of our solar system ([[Copernicus]] (1473\u20131543)), scientists  had to utilize thousands of measurements to finally conclude that Mars moves in an elliptical orbit about the sun ([[Kepler]] (1571\u20131630)), or to assemble multiple specific facts into the law of falling bodies ([[Galileo]] (1564\u20131642)).\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Compression===\n<!--Is this section common knowledge or original research? -->\nAn abstraction can be seen as a [[data compression|compression]] process,<ref>{{Citation |first=Gregory |last=Chaitin |authorlink=Gregory Chaitin | url=http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165230/http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf | archivedate=2015-05-09 |title=The Limits Of Reason |year=2006}}</ref> mapping multiple different pieces of [[wikt:constituent|constituent]] data to a single piece of abstract data;<ref>[[Murray Gell-Mann]] (1995) \"[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.6130010105/pdf What is complexity?

This conceptual scheme emphasizes the inherent equality of both constituent and abstract data, thus avoiding problems arising from the distinction between \"abstract\" and \"[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]]\". In this sense the process of abstraction entails the identification of similarities between objects, and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction (which is [[#Physicality|itself an object]]).\n:For example, ''[[#Simplification and ordering|picture 1 below]]''  illustrates the concrete relationship \"Cat sits on Mat\".\nChains of abstractions can  be [[construe]]d,<ref name = Ross>Ross, L. (1987). The Problem of Construal in Social Inference and Social Psychology. In N. Grunberg, R.E. Nisbett, J. Singer (eds), ''A Distinctive Approach to psychological research: the influence of Stanley Schacter''. Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum.</ref> moving from neural impulses arising from sensory [[perception]] to basic abstractions such as color or [[shape]], to experiential abstractions such as a specific cat, to [[semantic]] abstractions such as the \"idea\" of a CAT, to classes of objects such as \"mammals\" and even categories such as \"[[#Physicality|object]]\" as opposed to \"action\".\n:For example, ''[[#Simplification and ordering|graph 1 below]]''  expresses the abstraction \"agent sits on location\". This conceptual scheme entails no specific [[hierarchical]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] (such as the one mentioned involving cats and mammals), only a progressive [[#Simplification and ordering|exclusion of detail]].\n\n===Instantiation===\n\nNon-existent things in any particular place and time are often seen as abstract. By contrast, instances, or members, of such an abstract thing might exist in many different places and times. \n\nThose abstract things are then said to be ''multiply instantiated'', in the sense of ''picture 1'', ''picture 2'', etc., shown [[#Simplification and ordering|below]]. It is not sufficient, however, to define ''abstract'' ideas as those that can be instantiated and to define ''abstraction'' as the movement in the opposite direction to instantiation. Doing so would make the concepts \"cat\" and \"telephone\" abstract ideas since despite their varying appearances, a particular cat or a particular telephone is an instance of the concept \"cat\" or the concept \"telephone\". Although the concepts \"cat\" and \"telephone\" are ''abstractions'', they are not ''abstract'' in the sense of the objects in ''graph 1''  [[#Simplification and ordering|below]]. We might look at other graphs, in a progression from ''cat'' to ''mammal'' to ''animal'', and see that ''animal'' is more abstract than ''mammal''; but on the other hand ''mammal'' is a harder idea to express, certainly in relation to ''[[marsupial]]'' or ''[[monotreme]]''.\n\nPerhaps confusingly, some [[philosophy|philosophies]] refer to ''[[trope (philosophy)|tropes]]'' (instances of properties) as ''[[abstract particular]]s''\u2014e.g., the particular  [[red]]ness of a particular [[apple]] is an ''abstract particular''. This is similar to [[qualia]] and [[sumbebekos]].\n\n===Material process===\nStill retaining the primary meaning of 'abstrere' or 'to draw away from', the abstraction of money, for example, works by drawing away from the particular value of things allowing completely incommensurate objects to be compared (see the section on 'Physicality' below). [[Karl Marx]]'s writing on the [[commodity]] abstraction recognizes a parallel process.\n\nThe [[state (polity)]] as both concept and material practice exemplifies the two sides of this process of abstraction. Conceptually, 'the current concept of the state is an abstraction from the much more concrete early-modern use as the standing or status of the prince, his visible estates'. At the same time, materially, the 'practice of statehood is now constitutively and materially more abstract than at the time when princes ruled as the embodiment of extended power'.<ref>{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In \u2013 Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London }}, pp. 318\u201319.</ref> {{further information|Power projection|Display behavior}}\n\n===Ontological status===\nThe way that physical objects, like rocks and trees, have [[category of being|being]] differs from the way that properties of abstract concepts or relations have being, for example the way the [[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]], [[particular]], [[individual]]s pictured in ''[[#Simplification and ordering|picture 1]]'' exist differs from the way the concepts illustrated in ''[[#Simplification and ordering|graph 1]]'' exist. That difference accounts for the [[ontological]] usefulness of the word \"abstract\". The word applies to properties and relations to mark the fact that, if they exist, they do not exist in space or time, but that instances of them can exist, potentially in many different places and times.\n\n===Physicality===\n{{Further information|History of accounting#Ancient history}}\nA physical object (a possible referent of a concept or word) is considered ''concrete'' (not abstract) if it is a ''particular individual'' that occupies a particular place and time. However, in the secondary sense of the term 'abstraction', this physical object can carry materially abstracting processes. For example, record-keeping aids throughout the [[Fertile Crescent]] included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in containers. According to {{harvnb|Schmandt-Besserat|(1981)}}, these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a [[bill of lading]] or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers for the count, marks were placed on the outside of the containers. These physical marks, in other words, acted as material abstractions of a materially abstract process of accounting, using conceptual abstractions (numbers) to communicate its meaning.<ref>Eventually ([http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html Schmandt-Besserat estimates it took 4000 years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130084757/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html |date=January 30, 2012 }}) the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count.\n</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|author-link=Eleanor Robson|year=2008|title=Mathematics in Ancient Iraq|isbn=978-0-691-09182-2}}. p. 5: these calculi were in use in Iraq for primitive accounting systems as early as 3200\u20133000 BCE, with commodity-specific counting representation systems. Balanced accounting was in use by 3000\u20132350 BCE, and a [[sexagesimal number system]] was in use 2350\u20132000 BCE.</ref>\n\nAbstract things are sometimes defined as those things that do not exist in [[reality]] or exist only as sensory experiences, like the color [[red]]. That definition, however, suffers from the difficulty of deciding which things are real (i.e. which things exist in reality). For example, it is difficult to agree to whether concepts like ''God'', ''the number three'', and ''goodness'' are real, abstract, or both.\n\nAn approach to resolving such difficulty is to use ''[[predicate (grammar)|predicates]]'' as a general term for whether things are variously real, abstract, concrete, or of a particular property (e.g., ''good''). Questions about the properties of things are then [[proposition]]s about predicates, which propositions remain to be evaluated by the investigator. In the ''graph 1''  [[#Simplification and ordering|below]], the graphical relationships like the arrows joining boxes and ellipses might denote predicates.\n\n===Referencing and referring===\nAbstractions sometimes have ambiguous [[referent]]s; for example, \"[[happiness]]\" (when used as an abstraction) can refer to as many things as there are people and events or [[being|states of being]] which make them happy. Likewise, \"[[architecture]]\" refers not only to the design of safe, functional buildings, but also to elements of creation and [[innovation]] which aim at elegant solutions to [[construction]] problems, to the use of space, and to the attempt to evoke an [[emotion|emotional response]] in the builders, owners, viewers and users of the building.<!--See discussion pages 3 to 12 in Eugene Raskin, ''Architecturally Speaking, 2nd edition'', a Delta book, Dell (1966), trade paperback, 129 pages-->\n\n===Simplification and ordering===\nAbstraction uses a [[strategy]] of simplification, wherein formerly concrete details are left ambiguous, vague, or undefined; thus effective [[communication]] about things in the abstract requires an [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient. This is true for all verbal/abstract communication.\n\n[[File:Cat-on-mat.svg|thumb|250px|[[Conceptual graph]] for A Cat sitting on the Mat ''(graph 1)'']]\n[[File:JerryFelix.JPG|right|thumb|125px|Cat on Mat ''(picture 1)'']]\nFor example, many different things can be [[red]]. Likewise, many things sit on surfaces (as in ''picture 1'', to the right). The property of ''[[red]]ness'' and the [[Relation of Ideas|relation]] ''[[sitting|sitting-on]]'' are therefore abstractions of those objects. Specifically, the conceptual diagram ''graph 1'' identifies only three boxes, two ellipses, and four arrows (and their five labels), whereas the ''picture 1'' shows much more pictorial detail, with the scores of implied relationships as implicit in the picture rather than with the nine explicit details in the graph.\n\n''Graph 1'' details some explicit relationships between the objects of the diagram. For example, the arrow between the ''agent'' and ''CAT:Elsie'' depicts an example of an ''[[is-a]]'' relationship, as does the arrow between the ''location'' and the ''MAT''. The arrows between the [[gerund]]/[[present participle]] ''SITTING'' and the [[noun]]s ''agent'' and ''location'' express the [[diagram]]'s basic relationship; ''\"agent is SITTING on location\"''; ''Elsie'' is an instance of ''CAT''.<ref>[[John F. Sowa|Sowa, John F.]] (1984). ''Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine''. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|978-0-201-14472-7}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough the description ''sitting-on'' (graph 1) is more abstract than the graphic image of a cat sitting on a mat (picture 1), the delineation of abstract things from concrete things is somewhat ambiguous; this ambiguity or vagueness is characteristic of abstraction. Thus something as simple as a newspaper might be specified to six levels, as in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s illustration of that ambiguity, with a progression from abstract to concrete in ''[[G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach]]'' (1979):<ref>[[Douglas Hofstadter]] (1979) ''[[G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach]]''</ref>\n<blockquote>\n:(1) a publication\n::(2) a newspaper\n:::(3) ''The San Francisco Chronicle''\n::::(4) the May 18 edition of ''The San Francisco Chronicle''\n:::::(5) my copy of the May 18 edition of ''The San Francisco Chronicle''\n::::::(6) my copy of the May 18 edition of ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' as it was when I first picked it up (as contrasted with my copy as it was a few days later: in my fireplace, burning)\n</blockquote>\n\nAn abstraction can thus encapsulate each of these levels of detail with no [[loss of generality]]. But perhaps a detective or philosopher/scientist/engineer might seek to learn about something, at progressively deeper levels of detail, to solve a crime or a puzzle.\n\n===Thought processes===\nIn [[philosophy|philosophical terminology]], ''abstraction'' is the [[thinking|thought process]] wherein [[idea]]s<ref>But an idea can be [[symbol]]ized. \"A symbol is any device whereby we are enabled to make an abstraction.\" -- p.xi and chapter 20 of [[Suzanne K.

Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world\u2014it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003405/abstract-art|title=abstract art|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory.<ref>Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. NY/New Haven: The Drawing Center/Yale University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-300-10826-5}}</ref> Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freedom from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs.<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm National Gallery of Art: Abstraction.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608000000/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |date=June 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===In computer science===\n{{Main article|Abstraction (software engineering)}}\n[[Computer scientists]] use abstraction to make models that can be used and re-used without having to re-write all the program code for each new application on every different type of computer. They [[communication|communicate]] their solutions with the computer by writing [[source code]] in some particular [[computer language]] which can be translated into [[machine code]] for different types of computers to execute. Abstraction allows program designers to separate categories and concepts related to computing problems from specific instances of implementation. This means that the program code can be written so that it does not depend on the specific details of supporting applications, [[operating system]] software or hardware, but on an abstract concept of the solution to the problem that can then be integrated with the system with minimal additional work.\n\n=== In general semantics ===\nAbstractions and levels of abstraction play an important role in the theory of [[general semantics]] originated by [[Alfred Korzybski]].

Other analogous kinds of abstractions (sometimes called \"[[emic unit]]s\") considered by linguists include [[morpheme]]s, [[grapheme]]s, and [[lexeme]]s.\n\nAbstraction also arises in the relation between [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]]. Pragmatics involves considerations that make reference to the user of the language; semantics considers expressions and what they denote (the [[designata]]) abstracted from the language user; and syntax considers only the expressions themselves, abstracted from the designata.\n\n===In mathematics===\n{{Main article|Abstraction (mathematics)}}\nAbstraction in [[mathematics]] is the process of extracting the underlying essence of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.\n\nThe advantages of abstraction in mathematics are:\n* It reveals deep connections between different areas of mathematics\n* Known results in one area can suggest [[conjecture]]s in a related area\n* Techniques and methods from one area can be applied to prove results in a related area\n\nThe main disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts are more difficult to learn, and require a degree of [[mathematical maturity]] and experience before they can be assimilated.\n\n===In music===\nIn music, the term ''abstraction'' can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of [[tonality]]. [[Atonal]] music has no key signature, and is characterized by the exploration of internal numeric relationships.<ref>[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ABSTRACT.HTM Washington State University: Glossary of Abstraction.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911121123/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ABSTRACT.HTM |date=September 11, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===In neurology===\n{{Further information|Intelligence|Mental rotation|Mental operations}}\nA recent meta-analysis suggests that the verbal system has greater engagement for abstract concepts when the perceptual system is more engaged for processing of concrete concepts.

Lewis \"Cortical Networks Related to Human Use of Tools\" '''12''' (3): 211\u2013231 ''The Neuroscientist'' (June 1, 2006).</ref>\n\n===In philosophy===\nAbstraction in [[philosophy]] is the process (or, to some, the alleged process) in [[concept]] formation of recognizing some set of common features in [[individual]]s, and on that basis forming a concept of that feature. The notion of abstraction is important to understanding some philosophical controversies surrounding [[empiricism]] and the [[problem of universals]]. It has also recently become popular in formal logic under [[predicate abstraction]]. Another philosophical tool for discussion of abstraction is [[thought space]].\n\n===In psychology===\n[[Carl Jung]]'s definition of abstraction broadened its scope beyond the thinking process to include exactly four mutually exclusive, different complementary psychological functions: sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking. Together they form a structural totality of the differentiating abstraction process. Abstraction operates in one of these functions when it excludes the simultaneous influence of the other functions and other irrelevancies, such as emotion. Abstraction requires selective use of this structural split of abilities in the psyche. The opposite of abstraction is [[concretism (psychology)|concretism]]. ''Abstraction'' is one of Jung's 57 definitions in Chapter XI of ''[[Psychological Types]]''.\n<blockquote>\nThere is an abstract ''thinking'', just as there is abstract ''feeling'', ''sensation'' and ''intuition''. Abstract thinking singles out the rational, logical qualities ... Abstract feeling does the same with ... its feeling-values. ... I put abstract feelings on the same level as abstract thoughts. ... Abstract sensation would be aesthetic as opposed to sensuous ''sensation'' and abstract intuition would be symbolic as opposed to fantastic ''intuition''. (Jung, [1921] (1971): par. 678).\n</blockquote>\n\n===In social theory===\nIn social theory, abstraction is used as both an ideational and material process. [[Alfred Sohn-Rethel]], asked \"Can there be abstraction other than by thought?\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He used the example of commodity abstraction to show that abstraction occurs in practice as people create systems of abstract exchange that extend beyond the immediate physicality of the object and yet have real and immediate consequences. This work was extended through the 'Constitutive Abstraction' approach of writers associated with the Journal [[Arena (Australian publishing co-operative)|''Arena'']]. Two books that have taken this theme of the abstraction of social relations as an organizing process in human history are {{Cite book |  title= Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community | url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0761950737}}(1996) and the second volume of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community, published in 2006: {{Cite book | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In \u2013 Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006 }} These books argue that the nation is an abstract community bringing together strangers who will never meet as such; thus constituting materially real and substantial, but abstracted and mediated relations. The books suggest that contemporary processes of globalization and mediatization have contributed to materially abstracting relations between people, with major consequences for how we live our lives.\n\nIt can be easily argued that abstraction is an elementary methodological tool in several disciplines of social science. These disciplines have definite and different man concepts that highlight those aspects of man and his behaviour by idealization that are relevant for the given human science. For example, homo sociologicus is the man as sociology abstracts and idealizes it, depicting man as a social being. Moreover, we could talk about homo cyber sapiens<ref>{{cite book |last=Steels |first=Luc |title=The Homo Cyber Sapiens, the Robot Homonidus Intelligens, and the \u2018Artificial Life\u2019 Approach to Artificial Intelligence |location=Brussel |publisher=Vrije Universiteit, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory |year=1995 }}</ref> (the man who can extend his biologically determined intelligence thanks to new technologies), or homo creativus<ref>{{cite journal | last = Inkinen | first = Sam | year = 2009 | title = Homo Creativus \u2013 Creativity and Serendipity Management in Third Generation Science and Technology Parks | url = | journal = Science and Public Policy | volume = 36| issue = 7 | pages = 537\u2013548| doi = }}</ref> (who is simply creative).\n\nAbstraction (combined with Weberian [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealization]]) plays a crucial role in [[economics]]. Breaking away from directly experienced reality was a common trend in 19th century sciences (especially [[physics]]), and this was the effort which was fundamentally determined the way economics tried and still tries to approach the economic aspects of social life. It is abstraction we meet in the case of both Newton\u2019s physics and the neoclassical theory, since the goal was to grasp the unchangeable and timeless essence of phenomena. For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] created the concept of the material point by following the abstraction method so that he abstracted from the dimension and shape of any perceptible object, preserving only inertial and translational motion. Material point is the ultimate and common feature of all bodies. [[Neoclassical economists]] created the indefinitely abstract notion of [[homo economicus]] by following the same procedure. Economists abstract from all individual and personal qualities in order to get to those characteristics that embody the essence of economic activity. Eventually, it is the substance of the economic man that they try to grasp. Any characteristic beyond it only disturbs the functioning of this essential core.<ref>{{cite book |last=Galb\u00e1cs |first=Peter |chapter=Methodological Principles and an Epistemological Introduction|pages=1\u201352|title= The Theory of New Classical Macroeconomics.

That is, these are the groups that obey the axiom of [[commutativity]]. Abelian groups [[generalization|generalize]] the [[arithmetic]] of addition of [[integer]]s. They are named after early 19th century mathematician [[Niels Henrik Abel]].<ref>Jacobson 2009, p. 41</ref>\n\nThe concept of an abelian group is one of the first concepts encountered in undergraduate abstract algebra, from which many other basic concepts, such as [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[vector space]]s, are developed. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their [[nonabelian group|non-abelian]] counterparts, and finite abelian groups are very well understood. On the other hand, the theory of infinite abelian groups is an area of current research.\n\n{{Algebraic structures |Group}}\n\n== Definition ==\n{{Group-like structures}}\nAn abelian group is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], ''A'', together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] \u2022 that combines any two [[element (mathematics)|elements]] ''a'' and ''b'' to form another element denoted {{nowrap|''a'' \u2022 ''b''}}. The symbol \u2022 is a general placeholder for a concretely given operation. To qualify as an abelian group, the set and operation, {{nowrap|(''A'', \u2022)}}, must satisfy five requirements known as the ''abelian group axioms'':\n\n;Closure: For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''A'', the result of the operation {{nowrap|''a'' \u2022 ''b''}} is also in ''A''.\n;Associativity: For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''A'', the equation {{nowrap|1=(''a'' \u2022 ''b'') \u2022 ''c'' = ''a'' \u2022 (''b'' \u2022 ''c'')}} holds.\n;Identity element: There exists an element ''e'' in ''A'', such that for all elements ''a'' in ''A'', the equation {{nowrap|1=''e'' \u2022 ''a'' = ''a'' \u2022 ''e'' = ''a''}} holds.\n;Inverse element: For each ''a'' in ''A'', there exists an element ''b'' in ''A'' such that {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2022 ''b'' = ''b'' \u2022 ''a'' = ''e''}}, where ''e'' is the identity element.\n;Commutativity: For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''A'', ''a'' \u2022 ''b'' = ''b'' \u2022 ''a''.\n\nA group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a \"non-abelian group\" or \"non-commutative group\".\n\n== Facts ==\n\n=== Notation ===\n{{see also|Additive group|Multiplicative group}}\nThere are two main notational conventions for abelian groups \u2013 additive and multiplicative.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! Convention\n! Operation\n! Identity\n! Powers\n! Inverse\n|-\n! Addition\n| ''x'' + ''y'' || 0 || ''nx'' || \u2212''x''\n|-\n! Multiplication\n| ''x'' \u22c5 ''y'' or ''xy'' || ''e'' or 1\n| ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>\n| ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup>\n|}\n\nGenerally, the multiplicative notation is the usual notation for groups, while the additive notation is the usual notation for [[module (mathematics)|module]]s and [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s. The additive notation may also be used to emphasize that a particular group is abelian, whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered, some notable exceptions being [[near-ring]]s and [[partially ordered group]]s, where an operation is written additively even when non-abelian.\n\n=== Multiplication table ===\nTo verify that a [[finite group]] is abelian, a table (matrix) \u2013 known as a [[Cayley table]] \u2013 can be constructed in a similar fashion to a [[multiplication table]]. If the group is {{nowrap|1=''G'' = {''g''<sub>1</sub> = ''e'', ''g''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''g''<sub>''n''</sub>}<nowiki/>}} under the operation \u22c5, the {{nowrap|(''i'', ''j'')th}} entry of this table contains the product {{nowrap|''g''<sub>''i''</sub> \u22c5 ''g''<sub>''j''</sub>}}. The group is abelian if and only if this table is symmetric about the main diagonal.\n\nThis is true since if the group is abelian, then {{nowrap|1=''g''<sub>''i''</sub> \u22c5 ''g''<sub>''j''</sub> = ''g''<sub>''j''</sub> \u22c5 ''g''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. This implies that the {{nowrap|(''i'', ''j'')th}} entry of the table equals the {{nowrap|(''j'', ''i'')th}} entry, thus the table is symmetric about the main diagonal.\n\n== Examples ==\n* For the [[integer]]s and the operation [[addition]] \"+\", denoted {{nowrap|('''Z''', +)}}, the operation + combines any two integers to form a third integer, addition is associative, zero is the [[additive identity]], every integer ''n'' has an [[additive inverse]], \u2212''n'', and the addition operation is commutative since {{nowrap|1=''m'' + ''n'' = ''n'' + ''m''}} for any two integers ''m'' and ''n''.\n* Every [[cyclic group]] ''G'' is abelian, because if ''x'', ''y'' are in ''G'', then {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = ''a''<sup>''m''</sup>''a''<sup>''n''</sup>}} {{nowrap|1== ''a''<sup>''m'' + ''n''</sup>}} {{nowrap|1== ''a''<sup>''n'' + ''m''</sup>}} {{nowrap|1== ''a''<sup>''n''</sup>''a''<sup>''m''</sup> = ''yx''}}. Thus the [[integer]]s, '''Z''', form an abelian group under addition, as do the [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo ''n'']], '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''.\n* Every [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is an abelian group with respect to its addition operation. In a [[commutative ring]] the invertible elements, or [[unit (ring theory)|units]], form an abelian [[multiplicative group]]. In particular, the [[real number]]s are an abelian group under addition, and the nonzero real numbers are an abelian group under multiplication.\n* Every [[subgroup]] of an abelian group is [[normal subgroup|normal]], so each subgroup gives rise to a [[quotient group]]. Subgroups, quotients, and [[Direct sum of groups|direct sums]] of abelian groups are again abelian. The finite [[simple group|simple]] abelian groups are exactly the cyclic groups of prime order.<ref>Rose 2012, p. 32</ref>\n* The concepts of abelian group and '''Z'''-[[Module (mathematics)|module]] agree.  More specifically, every ''Z''-module is an abelian group with its operation of addition, and every abelian group is a module over the ring of integers '''Z''' in a unique way.\n\nIn general, [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], even invertible matrices, do not form an abelian group under multiplication because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. However, some groups of matrices are abelian groups under matrix multiplication \u2013 one example is the group of 2\u00d72 [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]].\n\n== Historical remarks ==\n<!-- This particular statement seems to be suspect, but the direction is right. Note: updated and corrected on Sept. 2, 2012 -->\n[[Camille Jordan]] named abelian groups after [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] [[Niels Henrik Abel]], because Abel found that the commutativity of the group of a [[polynomial]] implies that the roots of the polynomial can be [[solvability by radicals|calculated by using radicals]]. See Section 6.5 of Cox (2004) for more information on the historical background.\n\n== Properties ==\nIf ''n'' is a [[natural number]] and ''x'' is an element of an abelian group ''G'' written additively, then ''nx'' can be defined as {{nowrap|''x'' + ''x'' + ... + ''x''}} (''n'' summands) and {{nowrap|1=(\u2212''n'')''x'' = \u2212(''nx'')}}. In this way, ''G'' becomes a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] '''Z''' of integers. In fact, the modules over '''Z''' can be identified with the abelian groups.\n\nTheorems about abelian groups (i.e. [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over the [[principal ideal domain]] '''Z''') can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of [[finitely generated abelian group]]s which is a specialization of the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]. In the case of finitely generated abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form '''Z'''/''p''<sup>k</sup>'''Z''' for ''p'' prime, and the latter is a direct sum of finitely many copies of '''Z'''.\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f'', ''g'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''H''}} are two [[group homomorphism]]s between abelian groups, then their sum {{nowrap|''f'' + ''g''}}, defined by {{nowrap|1=(''f'' + ''g'') (''x'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''g''(''x'')}}, is again a homomorphism. (This is not true if ''H'' is a non-abelian group.) The set {{nowrap|Hom(''G'', ''H'')}} of all group homomorphisms from ''G'' to ''H'' thus turns into an abelian group in its own right.\n\nSomewhat akin to the [[dimension]] of [[vector space]]s, every abelian group has a ''[[rank of an abelian group|rank]]''. It is defined as the maximal [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of a set of [[linearly independent]] elements of the group. The integers and the [[rational number]]s have rank one, as well as every subgroup of the rationals.\n\nThe [[center (group theory)|center]] ''Z''(''G'') of a group ''G'' is the set of elements that commute with every element of ''G''. A group ''G'' is abelian if and only if it is equal to its center ''Z''(''G''). The center of a group ''G'' is always a [[characteristic subgroup|characteristic]] abelian subgroup of ''G''. If the quotient group ''G''/''Z''(''G'') of a group by its center is cyclic then ''G'' is abelian.<ref>Rose 2012, p. 48</ref>\n\n== Finite abelian groups ==\nCyclic groups of [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo ''n'']], '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''', were among the first examples of groups. It turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The [[automorphism group]] of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of [[Georg Frobenius]] and [[Ludwig Stickelberger]] and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of [[linear algebra]].\n\nAny group of prime order is isomorphic to a cyclic group and therefore abelian. Any group whose order is a square of a prime number is abelian.<ref>Rose 2012, p. 79</ref> In fact, for every prime number ''p'' there are (up to isomorphism) exactly two groups of order ''p''<sup>2</sup>, namely '''Z'''<sub>''p''<sup>2</sup></sub> and '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>\u00d7'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>.\n\n=== Classification ===\nThe '''fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups''' states that every finite abelian group ''G'' can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of [[prime number|prime]]-power order; it is also known as the '''basis theorem for finite abelian groups'''. This is generalized by the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]], with finite groups being the special case when ''G'' has zero [[rank of an abelian group|rank]]; this in turn admits numerous further generalizations.\n\nThe classification was proven by [[Leopold Kronecker]] in 1870, though it was not stated in modern group-theoretic terms until later, and was preceded by a similar classification of quadratic forms by Gauss in 1801; see [[Fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups#History|history]] for details.\n\nThe cyclic group '''Z'''<sub>''mn''</sub> of order ''mn'' is isomorphic to the direct sum of '''Z'''<sub>''m''</sub> and '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub> if and only if ''m'' and ''n'' are [[coprime]]. It follows that any finite abelian group ''G'' is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form\n\n:<math>\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{u}\\ \\mathbf{Z}_{k_i}</math>\n\nin either of the following canonical ways:\n* the numbers ''k''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''k''<sub>''u''</sub> are powers of (not necessarily distinct) primes,\n* or ''k''<sub>1</sub> [[divisor|divides]] ''k''<sub>2</sub>, which divides ''k''<sub>3</sub>, and so on up to ''k''<sub>''u''</sub>.\n\nFor example, '''Z'''<sub>15</sub> can be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 5: {{nowrap|'''Z'''<sub>15</sub> \u2245 {0, 5, 10} \u2295 {0, 3, 6, 9, 12}.}} The same can be said for any abelian group of order 15, leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order 15 are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]].\n\nFor another example, every abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either '''Z'''<sub>8</sub> (the integers 0 to 7 under addition modulo 8), {{nowrap|'''Z'''<sub>4</sub> \u2295 '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}} (the odd integers 1 to 15 under multiplication modulo 16), or {{nowrap|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub> \u2295 '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> \u2295 '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nSee also [[list of small groups]] for finite abelian groups of order 30 or less.\n\n=== Automorphisms ===\nOne can apply the [[#Classification|fundamental theorem]] to count (and sometimes determine) the [[Group isomorphism#Automorphisms|automorphisms]] of a given finite abelian group ''G''. To do this, one uses the fact that if ''G'' splits as a direct sum {{nowrap|''H'' \u2295 ''K''}} of subgroups of [[coprime]] order, then {{nowrap|Aut(''H'' \u2295 ''K'') \u2245 Aut(''H'') \u2295 Aut(''K'')}}.\n\nGiven this, the fundamental theorem shows that to compute the automorphism group of ''G'' it suffices to compute the automorphism groups of the [[Sylow theorems|Sylow]] ''p''-subgroups separately (that is, all direct sums of cyclic subgroups, each with order a power of ''p''). Fix a prime ''p'' and suppose the exponents ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> of the cyclic factors of the Sylow ''p''-subgroup are arranged in increasing order:\n\n:<math>e_1\\leq e_2 \\leq\\cdots\\leq e_n</math>\n\nfor some {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 0}}. One needs to find the automorphisms of\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{Z}_{p^{e_1}} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathbf{Z}_{p^{e_n}}.</math>\n\nOne special case is when ''n'' = 1, so that there is only one cyclic prime-power factor in the Sylow ''p''-subgroup ''P''. In this case the theory of automorphisms of a finite [[cyclic group]] can be used. Another special case is when ''n'' is arbitrary but {{nowrap|1=''e''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1 for 1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''n''}}. Here, one is considering ''P'' to be of the form\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{Z}_p \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathbf{Z}_p,</math>\n\nso elements of this subgroup can be viewed as comprising a vector space of dimension ''n'' over the finite field of ''p'' elements '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>. The automorphisms of this subgroup are therefore given by the invertible linear transformations, so\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{Aut}(P)\\cong\\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbf{F}_p),</math>\n\nwhere GL is the appropriate [[general linear group]]. This is easily shown to have order\n\n:<math>|\\mathrm{Aut}(P)|=(p^n-1)\\cdots(p^n-p^{n-1}).</math>\n\nIn the most general case, where the ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''n'' are arbitrary, the automorphism group is more difficult to determine. It is known, however, that if one defines\n\n:<math>d_k=\\mathrm{max}\\{r|e_r = e_k^{\\,}\\}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>c_k=\\mathrm{min}\\{r|e_r=e_k^{\\,}\\}</math>\n\nthen one has in particular {{nowrap|''d''<sub>''k''</sub> \u2265 ''k''}}, {{nowrap|''c''<sub>''k''</sub> \u2264 ''k''}}, and\n\n:<math>|\\mathrm{Aut}(P)| = \\prod_{k=1}^n{(p^{d_k}-p^{k-1})}\\prod_{j=1}^n{(p^{e_j})^{n-d_j}}\\prod_{i=1}^n{(p^{e_i-1})^{n-c_i+1}}.</math>\n\nOne can check that this yields the orders in the previous examples as special cases (see Hillar, C., & Rhea, D.).\n\n==Finitely generated abelian groups==\n{{main|Finitely generated abelian group}}\nAn abelian group {{mvar|A}} is finitely generated if it contains a finite set of elements (called ''generators'') <math>G=\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}</math> such that every element of the group is a [[linear combination]] with integer coefficients of elements of {{mvar|G}}. \n\nLet {{mvar|L}} be a [[free abelian group]] with basis <math>B=\\{b_1, \\ldots, b_n\\}.</math> \nThere is a unique [[group homomorphism]]\n<math>p\\colon L \\to A,</math> such that \n:<math>p(b_i) = x_i\\quad \\text{for}\\; i=1,\\ldots, n.</math>\nThis homomorphism is surjective, and its [[kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] is finitely generated (since integers form a [[Noetherian ring]]). Let us consider the matrix {{mvar|M}} with integer entries, such that the entries of its {{mvar|j}}th column are the coefficients of the {{mvar|j}}th generator of the kernel. Then, the abelian group is isomorphic to the [[cokernel]] of linear map defined by {{mvar|M}}. Conversely every [[integer matrix]] defines a finitely generated abelian group.\n\nIt follows that the study of finitely generated abelian groups is totally equivalent with the study of integer matrices. In particular, changing the generating set of {{mvar|A}} is equivalent with multiplying {{mvar|M}} on the left by a [[unimodular matrix]] (that is an invertible integer matrix whose inverse is also an integer matrix). Changing the generating set of the kernel of {{mvar|M}} is equivalent with multiplying {{mvar|M}} on the right by an unimodular matrix.\n\nThe [[Smith normal form]] of {{mvar|M}} is a matrix\n:<math>S=UMV,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|U}} and {{mvar|V}} are unimodular, and {{mvar|S}} is a matrix such that all non-diagonal entries are zero, the non-zero diagonal entries {{tmath|d_{1,1}, \\ldots, d_{k,k} }} are the first ones, and {{tmath|d_{i,i} }} is a divisor of {{tmath|d_{i,i} }} for {{math|''i'' > ''j''}}. The existence and the shape of the Smith normal proves that the finitely generated abelian group {{mvar|A}} is the [[direct sum]] \n:<math>\\Z^r \\oplus \\Z/d_{1,1}\\Z \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\Z/d_{k,k}\\Z,</math> \nwhere {{mvar|r}} is the number of zero rows at the bottom of {{mvar|r}} (and also the [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] of the group). This is the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]].\n\nThe existence of algorithms for Smith normal form shows that the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups is not only a theorem of abstract existence, but provides a way for computing expression of finitely generated abelian groups as direct sums.\n\n== Infinite abelian groups ==\nThe simplest infinite abelian group is the [[infinite cyclic group]] '''Z'''. Any [[finitely generated abelian group]] ''A'' is isomorphic to the direct sum of ''r'' copies of '''Z''' and a finite abelian group, which in turn is decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many [[cyclic group]]s of primary orders. Even though the decomposition is not unique, the number ''r'', called the [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] of ''A'', and the prime powers giving the orders of finite cyclic summands are uniquely determined.\n\nBy contrast, classification of general infinitely generated abelian groups is far from complete. [[Divisible group]]s, i.e. abelian groups ''A'' in which the equation {{nowrap|1=''nx'' = ''a''}} admits a solution {{nowrap|''x'' \u2208 ''A''}} for any natural number ''n'' and element ''a'' of ''A'', constitute one important class of infinite abelian groups that can be completely characterized. Every divisible group is isomorphic to a direct sum, with summands isomorphic to '''Q''' and [[Pr\u00fcfer group]]s '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>/'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> for various prime numbers ''p'', and the cardinality of the set of summands of each type is uniquely determined.<ref>For example, {{nowrap|'''Q'''/'''Z''' \u2245 \u2211<sub>''p''</sub> '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>/'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.</ref> Moreover, if a divisible group ''A'' is a subgroup of an abelian group ''G'' then ''A'' admits a direct complement: a subgroup ''C'' of ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''G'' = ''A'' \u2295 ''C''}}. Thus divisible groups are [[injective module]]s in the category of abelian groups, and conversely, every injective abelian group is divisible ([[Baer's criterion]]). An abelian group without non-zero divisible subgroups is called '''reduced'''.\n\nTwo important special classes of infinite abelian groups with diametrically opposite properties are ''torsion groups'' and ''torsion-free groups'', exemplified by the groups '''Q'''/'''Z''' (periodic) and '''Q''' (torsion-free).\n\n=== Torsion groups ===\n\nAn abelian group is called '''[[periodic group|periodic]]''' or '''[[torsion (algebra)|torsion]]''', if every element has finite [[order (group theory)|order]]. A direct sum of finite cyclic groups is periodic. Although the converse statement is not true in general, some special cases are known. The first and second [[Pr\u00fcfer theorems]] state that if ''A'' is a periodic group, and it either has a '''bounded exponent''', i.e., {{nowrap|1=''nA'' = 0}} for some natural number ''n'', or is countable and the [[height (abelian group)|''p''-heights]] of the elements of ''A'' are finite for each ''p'', then ''A'' is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups.<ref>Countability assumption in the second Pr\u00fcfer theorem cannot be removed: the torsion subgroup of the [[direct product]] of the cyclic groups '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''m''</sup>'''Z''' for all natural ''m'' is not a direct sum of cyclic groups.</ref> The cardinality of the set of direct summands isomorphic to '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''m''</sup>'''Z''' in such a decomposition is an invariant of ''A''. These theorems were later subsumed in the '''Kulikov criterion'''. In a different direction, [[Helmut Ulm]] found an extension of the second Pr\u00fcfer theorem to countable abelian ''p''-groups with elements of infinite height: those groups are completely classified by means of their [[Ulm invariant]]s.\n\n=== Torsion-free and mixed groups ===\n\nAn abelian group is called '''torsion-free''' if every non-zero element has infinite order. Several classes of [[torsion-free abelian group]]s have been studied extensively:\n\n* [[Free abelian group]]s, i.e. arbitrary direct sums of '''Z'''\n* [[Cotorsion group|Cotorsion]] and [[algebraically compact module|algebraically compact]] torsion-free groups such as the [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]]\n* [[Slender group]]s\n\nAn abelian group that is neither periodic nor torsion-free is called '''mixed'''. If ''A'' is an abelian group and ''T''(''A'') is its [[torsion subgroup]], then the factor group ''A''/''T''(''A'') is torsion-free. However, in general the torsion subgroup is not a direct summand of ''A'', so  ''A'' is ''not'' isomorphic to {{nowrap|''T''(''A'') \u2295 ''A''/''T''(''A'')}}. Thus the theory of mixed groups involves more than simply combining the results about periodic and torsion-free groups.\n\n=== Invariants and classification ===\nOne of the most basic invariants of an infinite abelian group ''A'' is its [[rank of an abelian group|rank]]: the cardinality of the maximal [[linearly independent]] subset of ''A''. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1]] are necessarily subgroups of '''Q''' and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank ''r'' is a subgroup of '''Q'''<sup>''r''</sup>. On the other hand, the group of [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]] '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite '''Z'''-rank and the groups '''Z'''{{su|b=''p''|p=''n''}} with different ''n'' are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups.\n\nThe classification theorems for finitely generated, divisible, countable periodic, and rank 1 torsion-free abelian groups explained above were all obtained before 1950 and form a foundation of the classification of more general infinite abelian groups. Important technical tools used in classification of infinite abelian groups are [[pure subgroup|pure]] and [[basic subgroup|basic]] subgroups. Introduction of various invariants of torsion-free abelian groups has been one avenue of further progress. See the books by [[Irving Kaplansky]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Fuchs]], [[Phillip Griffith]], and [[David Arnold (mathematician)|David Arnold]], as well as the proceedings of the conferences on Abelian Group Theory published in ''[[Lecture Notes in Mathematics]]'' for more recent findings.\n\n=== Additive groups of rings ===\nThe additive group of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] is an abelian group, but not all abelian groups are additive groups of rings (with nontrivial multiplication). Some important topics in this area of study are:\n\n* [[Tensor product]]\n* Corner's results on countable torsion-free groups\n* Shelah's work to remove cardinality restrictions.\n\n== Relation to other mathematical topics ==\nMany large abelian groups possess a natural [[topology]], which turns them into [[topological group]]s.\n\nThe collection of all abelian groups, together with the [[Group homomorphism|homomorphisms]] between them, forms the [[category of abelian groups|category]] '''Ab''', the prototype of an [[abelian category]].\n\nNearly all well-known [[algebraic structure]]s other than [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]] are [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]]. Hence it is surprising that Tarski's student {{harvs|first=Wanda|last=Szmielew|authorlink=Wanda Szmielew|year=1955|txt}} proved that the first order theory of abelian groups, unlike its nonabelian counterpart, is decidable. This decidability, plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above, highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory, but there are still many areas of current research:\n*Amongst torsion-free abelian groups of finite rank, only the finitely generated case and the [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1|rank 1]] case are well understood;\n*There are many unsolved problems in the theory of infinite-rank torsion-free abelian groups;\n*While countable torsion abelian groups are well understood through simple presentations and Ulm invariants, the case of countable mixed groups is much less mature.\n*Many mild extensions of the first order theory of abelian groups are known to be undecidable.\n*Finite abelian groups remain a topic of research in [[computational group theory]].\n\nMoreover, abelian groups of infinite order lead, quite surprisingly, to deep questions about the [[set theory]] commonly assumed to underlie all of mathematics. Take the [[Whitehead problem]]: are all Whitehead groups of infinite order also [[free abelian group]]s? In the 1970s, [[Saharon Shelah]] proved that the Whitehead problem is:\n* [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC|Undecidable in ZFC]] ([[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms]]), the conventional [[axiomatic set theory]] from which nearly all of present-day mathematics can be derived. The Whitehead problem is also the first question in ordinary mathematics proved undecidable in ZFC;\n* Undecidable even if [[ZFC]] is augmented by taking the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] as an axiom;\n* Positively answered if ZFC is augmented with the axiom of [[Constructible universe|constructibility]] (see [[statements true in L]]).\n\n== A note on the typography ==\nAmong mathematical [[adjective]]s derived from the [[proper name]] of a [[mathematician]], the word \"abelian\" is rare in that it is often spelled with a lowercase '''a''', rather than an uppercase '''A''', indicating how ubiquitous the concept is in modern mathematics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_04_04.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701231658/http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_04_04.html |archive-date=1 July 2013|dead-url=yes|access-date=3 July 2016|title=Abel Prize Awarded: The Mathematicians' Nobel}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Abelianization]]\n*[[Class field theory]]\n*[[Commutator subgroup]]\n*[[Dihedral group of order 6]], the smallest non-Abelian group\n*[[Elementary abelian group]]\n*[[Pontryagin duality]]\n*[[Pure injective module]]\n*[[Pure projective module]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last=Cox |first=David |date=2004 |title=Galois Theory |publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]] |mr=2119052 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Fuchs |first=L\u00e1szl\u00f3 |date=1970 |title=Infinite Abelian Groups |series=Pure and Applied Mathematics |volume=36-I |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |mr=0255673 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Fuchs |first=L\u00e1szl\u00f3 |date=1973 |title=Infinite Abelian Groups |series=Pure and Applied Mathematics |volume=36-II |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |mr=0349869 }}\n* {{cite book |first=Phillip A. |last=Griffith  |date=1970 |title=Infinite Abelian group theory |series=Chicago Lectures in Mathematics |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=0-226-30870-7}}\n* {{cite book |last=Rose |first=John S. |date=2012 |title=A Course on Group Theory |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=0-486-68194-7|ref=harv}} Unabridged and unaltered republication of a work first published by the Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, in 1978.\n* {{cite book |last=Herstein |first=I.

During this period, the US considered the defense of the US as part of reducing the overall damage inflicted in a full nuclear exchange. As part of this defense, [[Canada]] and the US established the North American Air Defense Command (now called [[NORAD|North American Aerospace Defense Command]]).\n\nBy the early 1950s, US research on the [[Project Nike|Nike Zeus]] missile system had developed to the point where small improvements would allow it to be used as the basis of an operational ABM system. Work started on a short-range, high-speed counterpart known as [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] to provide defense for the ABM sites themselves. By the mid-1960s, both systems showed enough promise to start development of base selection for a limited ABM system dubbed [[National Missile Defense#Sentinel Program|Sentinel]]. In 1967, the US announced that Sentinel itself would be scaled down to the smaller and less expensive [[Safeguard Program|Safeguard]]. Soviet doctrine called for development of its own ABM system and return to strategic parity with the US. This was achieved with the operational deployment of the [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system|A-35 ABM system]] and its successors, which remain operational to this day.\n\nThe development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle ([[MIRV]]) systems allowed a single ICBM to deliver as many as ten separate warheads at a time.  An ABM defense system could be overwhelmed with the sheer number of warheads.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=International Arms Control: Issues and Agreements (Studies in International Security & Arms Control)\n|author=Coit D.

It was ruled by the [[House of Habsburg]], and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states were co-equal.

Hungarian dissatisfaction arose partly from Austria's suppression with [[Russian Empire|Russian]] support of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Hungarian liberal revolution]] of 1848\u201349. However, dissatisfaction with Austrian rule had grown for many years within Hungary and had many other causes.\n\nBy the late 1850s, a large number of Hungarians who had supported the 1848\u201349 revolution were willing to accept the Habsburg monarchy. They argued that while Hungary had the right to full internal independence, under the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], foreign affairs and defense were \"common\" to both Austria and Hungary.<ref name=\"Kann 1974\">{{harvnb|Kann|1974|pp=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz|Austrian defeat at K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]], the government realized it needed to reconcile with Hungary to regain the status of a great power. The new foreign minister, [[Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust]], wanted to conclude the stalemated negotiations with the Hungarians. To secure the monarchy, Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] began negotiations for a compromise with the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] nobility, led by [[Ferenc De\u00e1k]], to ensure their support. In particular, Hungarian leaders demanded and received the Emperor's coronation as King of Hungary and the re-establishment of a separate parliament at [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] with powers to enact laws for the lands of the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]].<ref name=\"Kann 1974\"/>\n\nFrom 1867 onwards, the abbreviations heading the names of official institutions in Austria-Hungary reflected their responsibility: {{lang|de|k. u. k.}} (''{{lang|de|kaiserlich und k\u00f6niglich}}'' or [[Imperial and Royal]]) was the label for institutions common to both parts of the Monarchy, e.g. the ''{{lang|de|k.u.k. Kriegsmarine}}'' (War Fleet) and, during the war, the ''{{lang|de|k.u.k. Armee}}'' (Army). There were three ''{{lang|de|k.u.k.}}'' or joint ministries:\n* The Imperial and Royal Ministry of the Exterior and the Imperial House\n* The Imperial and Royal War Ministry\n* The Imperial and Royal Ministry of Finance\n\nThe last was responsible only for financing the Imperial and Royal household, the diplomatic service, the common army and the common war fleet. All other state functions were to be handled separately by each of the two states.<ref name=\"Taylor 1964\">{{harvnb|Taylor|1964|pp=}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1867 onwards, common expenditures were allocated 70% to Austria and 30% to Hungary. This split had to be negotiated every decade. By 1907, the Hungarian share had risen to 36.4%.<ref name=\"kronenbitter\"/> The negotiations in 1917 ended with the dissolution of the Dual Monarchy.\n\nThe common army changed its label from ''{{lang|de|k.k.}}'' to ''{{lang|de|k.u.k.}}'' only in 1889 at the request of the Hungarian government.\n* ''{{lang|de|K. k.}}'' (''{{lang|de|kaiserlich-k\u00f6niglich}}'') or [[Imperial-Royal]] was the term for institutions of [[Cisleithania]] (Austria); \"royal\" in this label referred to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]].\n* ''{{lang|de|K. u.}}'' (''{{lang|de|k\u00f6niglich-ungarisch}}'') or ''{{lang|de|M. k.}}'' (''{{lang|de|Magyar kir\u00e1lyi}}'') (\"Royal Hungarian\") referred to [[Transleithania]], the lands of the Hungarian crown.

Linking/co-ordinating the two parliaments fell to a government under the monarch. In this sense Austria-Hungary remained under an authoritarian government, as the Emperor-King appointed both Austrian and Hungarian Prime ministers along with their respective cabinets. This made both Governments responsible to the Emperor-King, as neither half could have a government with a program contrary to the views of the Monarch. The Emperor-King could appoint non-parliamentary governments, for example, or maintain in power a government which does not have a majority in Parliament to block the formation of another which he does not approve. The Monarch had other prerogatives such as the right of Royal Assent before any kind of Bill would be presented to the National Assembly (the common name for the Hungarian Diet), the right to Veto all legislation passed by the National Assembly, and the power to prorogue or dissolve the Assembly and call to new elections (he had the same prerogatives considering the Croatian-Slavonian Diet or Croatian Parliament, the common name for the Croatian-Slavonian Diet). In the Austrian half, however, the Monarchs's power was even greater, as the Emperor had the power to both appoint and dismiss its Prime minister and cabinet members. The monarch's common government, in which its ministers were appointed by the Monarch and responsible to him, had the responsibility for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|army]], for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|navy]], for foreign policy, and for the [[customs union]].<ref name=\"Kann 1974\"/> Due to the lack of common law between Austria and Hungary, to conclude identical texts, each parliament elected 60 of its members to form a delegation that discussed motions of the Imperial and Royal ministries separately and worked towards a compromise.<ref name=\"Taylor 1964\"/>\n\nA common Ministerial Council ruled the common government: it comprised the three ministers for the joint responsibilities (joint finance, military, and foreign policy), the two prime ministers, some Archdukes and the monarch.<ref name=\"Sked 1989\">{{harvnb|Sked|1989|pp=}}</ref> Two delegations of representatives (60\u201360 members), one each from the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, met separately and voted on the expenditures of the Common Ministerial Council giving the two governments influence in the common administration. However, the ministers ultimately answered only to the monarch who had the final decision on matters of foreign and military policy.\n\nOverlapping responsibilities between the joint ministries and the ministries of the two halves caused friction and inefficiencies.<ref name=\"Taylor 1964\"/> The armed forces suffered particularly from overlap. Although the unified government determined the overall military direction, the Austrian and Hungarian governments each remained in charge of recruiting, supplies and training. Each government could have a strong influence over common governmental responsibilities. Each half of the Dual Monarchy proved quite prepared to disrupt common operations to advance its own interests.<ref name=\"Sked 1989\"/>\n\nRelations during the half-century after 1867 between the two parts of the dual monarchy featured repeated disputes over shared external tariff arrangements and over the financial contribution of each government to the common treasury. Under the terms of the \"Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867\", an agreement renegotiated every ten years, determined these matters. There was political turmoil during the build-up to each renewal of the agreement. The disputes culminated in the early 1900s in a prolonged [[constitutional crisis]]. It was triggered by disagreement over which language to use for command in [[Military of Hungary|Hungarian army]] units, and deepened by the advent to power in Budapest in April 1906 of a Hungarian nationalist coalition. Provisional renewals of the common arrangements occurred in October 1907 and in November 1917 on the basis of the ''status quo''.<ref name=\"Taylor 1964\"/>\n\n===Judicial system===\n\n====Empire of Austria====\n\n{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}\n\n====Kingdom of Hungary====\n\nThe judicial power was independent of the administrative power. After 1868 ([[Croatian\u2013Hungarian Settlement]]), Croatia-Slavonia had its own independent judicial system (the Table of Seven was the court of last instance for Croatia-Slavonia with final civil and criminal jurisdiction). The judicial authorities in Hungary were:\n# the district courts with single judges (458 in 1905);\n# the county courts with collegiate judgeships (76 in number); to these were attached 15 jury courts for press offences. These were courts of first instance. In Croatia-Slavonia these were known as the court tables after 1874;\n# Royal Tables (12 in number), which were courts of second instance, established at Budapest, Debrecen, Gy\u0151r, Kassa, Kolozsv\u00e1r, Marosv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, Nagyv\u00e1rad, P\u00e9cs, Pressburg, Szeged, Temesv\u00e1r and Ban's Table at Zagreb.\n# The Royal Supreme Court at Budapest, and the Supreme Court of Justice, or Table of Seven, at Zagreb, which were the highest judicial authorities. There were also a special commercial court at Budapest, a naval court at Fiume, and special army courts.<ref name=\"h1911\"/>\n\n===Public administration and local governments===\n\n====Empire of Austria====\n[[File:Otev\u0159en\u00ed mostu 14. 6. 1904.jpg|thumb|Emperor Franz Joseph I visiting [[Prague]] and opening the new Emperor Francis I. Bridge in 1901]]\n[[File:Rz\u0105ca_Tadeusz,_Rynek_G\u0142\u00f3wny_w_Krakowie.jpg|thumb|[[Krak\u00f3w]], a historical Polish city in the Austro-Hungarian Empire where in 1870 authorities allowed the use of the Polish language in the [[Jagiellonian University]].]]\nThe organization of the administrative system in the Austrian Empire was complicated by the fact that between the State and the purely local communal administration there intruded yet a third element, grounded in history, the territories (L\u00e4nder). The State administration comprised all affairs having relation to rights, duties and interests \"which are common to all territories\"; all other administrative tasks were left to the territories. Finally, the communes had self-government within their own sphere.\n\nTo this division of the work of administration corresponded a three-fold organization of the authorities: State, territorial and communal. The State authorities were divided on geographical lines into central, intermediate and local, and side by side with this there was a division of the offices for the transaction of business according to the various branches of the administration. The central authorities, which as early as the 18th century worked together in a common mother cell of the State chancery, became differentiated so soon as the growing tasks of administration called for specialization; in 1869 there were seven departments, and in the concluding decade of the Austrian Empire there were set up Ministries of Labour, Food, Public Health and Social Care. Under these ministries came the Statthalter, whose administrative area had ordinarily the proportions of a Crown territory (Kronland); but the immense variations in area of the Crown territories made a uniform and consistent intermediate administrative organization practically impossible. The lowest administrative unit was the political sub-district (''Bezirk'') under an official (''Bezirkshauptmann''), who united nearly all the administrative functions which were divided among the various ministries according to their attributions.\n\nSide by side with the State administration certain Crown territory administrations also existed in the 17 Crown territories, carried on by selected honorary officials, having under them a staff of professional officials. Many branches of the territorial administration had great similarities with those of the State, so that their spheres of activity frequently overlapped and came into collision. This administrative \"double track\", as it was called, led, it is true, in many cases to lively emulation, but was on the whole highly extravagant. The evils of this complicated system are obvious, and easy to condemn. They can be explained, partly by the origin of the State \u2013 for the most part through a voluntary union of countries possessed by a strong sense of their own individuality \u2013 partly by the influence in Austria of the Germanic spirit, well understood by the Slavs, which has nothing of the Latin tendency to reduce all questions of administration to clear-cut formulae as part of a logically consistent system. Like the English administrative system, the Austrian presented a rich variety, a variety indeed so rich that it clamoured for drastic reform.\n\nBienerth's last act as premier in May 1911 was the appointment of a commission nominated by the Emperor, to draw up a scheme of administrative reform. So early as 1904 KOrber had declared a complete change in the principles of administration to be essential if the machinery of State were to continue working. After seven years of inaction, however, this imperial rescript was pitched in a far lower key. The continuous progress of society, it said, had made increased demands on the administration, that is to say, it was assumed that reform was not demanded so much by the defects of the administration but by the progress of the times, not because the administration was bad, but because life was better. It was an attempt to reform the administration without first reforming the State on equivalent lines.\n\nA reform commission without a programme naturally first occupied itself with reforms about which there was no controversy. After a year had gone by it drew up \"Proposals for the training of State officials\". After another two years it had indeed brought to light carefully prepared material for study, which was of great scientific value; but its proposals. though politically of importance, did not provide any basis for reform on a large scale. And so when the World War broke out the commission dispersed without practical results, leaving behind it an imposing array of folio volumes of great scientific value. It was not till March 1918 that the Seidler Government decided upon a programme of national autonomy as a basis for administrative reform, which was, however, never carried into effect.<ref>\"Austrian Empire\" article of ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' 1911</ref>\n\n====Kingdom of Hungary====\n\n=====Administrative divisions and the counties of Hungary=====\n[[File:Ferenc J\u00f3zsef koron\u00e1z\u00e1sa Bud\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|Coronation]] of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] and [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Elisabeth Amalie]] at [[Matthias Church]], [[Buda]], 8 June 1867]]\nFrom 1867 the administrative and political divisions of the lands belonging to the Hungarian crown were  in great measure remodelled. In 1868 Transylvania was definitely reunited to Hungary proper, and the town and district of Fiume declared autonomous. In 1873 part of the \"Military Frontier\" was united with Hungary proper and part with Croatia-Slavonia. Hungary proper, according to ancient usage, was generally divided into four great divisions or circles, and Transylvania up to 1876 was regarded as the fifth. In 1876 a general system of counties was introduced. According to this division Hungary proper is divided into seven circles, of which Transylvania forms one. The whole country is divided into the following counties:\n\n(a) The circle on the left bank of the Danube contains eleven counties: (1) \u00c1rva, (2) Bars, (3) Esztergom, (4) Hont, (5) Lipt\u00f3, (6) N\u00f3gr\u00e1d, (7) Nyitra, (8) Pozsony (9) Trencs\u00e9n, (10) T\u00far\u00f3cz and (11) Z\u00f3lyom.\n\n(b) The circle on the right bank of the Danube contains eleven counties: Baranya, Fej\u00e9r, Gy\u0151r, Kom\u00e1rom, Moson, Somogy, Sopron, Tolna, Vas, Veszpr\u00e9m and Zala.\n\n(c) The circle between the Danube and Tisza contains five counties: B\u00e1cs-Bodrog, Csongr\u00e1d, Heves, J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok and Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun.\n\n(d) The circle on the right bank of the Tisza contains eight counties: Aba\u00faj-Torna, Bereg, Borsod, G\u00f6m\u00f6r-es Kis-Hont, S\u00e1ros, Szepes, Ung, Zempl\u00e9n.\n\n(e) The circle on the left bank of the Tisza contains eight counties: B\u00e9k\u00e9s, Bihar, Hajd\u00fa, M\u00e1ramaros, Szabolcs, Szatm\u00e1r, Szil\u00e1gy and Ugocsa.\n\n(f) The circle between the Tisza and the Maros contains five counties: Arad, Csan\u00e1d, Krass\u00f3-Sz\u00f6r\u00e9ny, Temes and Toront\u00e1l.\n\n(g) Transylvania contains fifteen counties: Also-Feh\u00e9r, Besztercze-Nasz\u00f3d, Brass\u00f3, Cs\u00edk, Fogaras, H\u00e1romszek, Hunyad, Kis-K\u00fck\u00fcll\u0151, Kolozs, Maros-Torda, Nagy-K\u00fck\u00fcll\u0151, Szeben, Szolnok-Doboka, Torda-Aranyos and Udvarhely.\n\nFiume town and district forms a separate division.\n\nCroatia-Slavonia is divided into eight counties: Bjelovar-Kri\u017eevci, Lika-Krbava, Modrus-Fiume, Pozega, Srijemska, Vara\u017edin, Virovitica and Zagreb.\n\n=====Municipal rights of the biggest cities in Hungary=====\n\nIn regard to local government, the country was divided into municipalities or counties, which possessed a certain amount of self-government. Hungary proper was divided into sixty-three rural, and\u2014including Fiume\u2014twenty-six urban municipalities (see section on Administrative Divisions). These urban municipalities were towns which for their local government were independent of the counties in which they were situated, and have, therefore, a larger amount of municipal autonomy than the communes or the other towns. The administration of the municipalities is carried on by an official appointed by the king, aided by a representative body. Since 1876 each municipality had a council of twenty members to exercise control over its administration. According to this division Hungary proper is divided into seven circles.<ref name=\"h1911\"/>\n\nBesides these sixty-three rural counties for Hungary, and eight for Croatia-Slavonia, Hungary had twenty-six urban counties or towns with municipal rights. These were: Arad, Baja, Debreczen, Gy\u0151r, H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, Kassa, Kecskem\u00e9t, Kolozsv\u00e1r, Kom\u00e1rom, Marosv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, Nagyv\u00e1rad, Pancsova, P\u00e9cs, Pozsony, Selmecz- \u00e9s B\u00e9labanya, Sopron, Szabadka, Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti, Szeged, Sz\u00e9kesfeherv\u00e1r, Temesv\u00e1r, \u00dajvid\u00e9k, Versecz, Zombor, the town of Fiume and Budapest, the capital of the country.<ref name=\"h1911\"/>\n\nIn Croatia-Slavonia there are four urban counties or towns with municipal rights namely: Osijek, Vara\u017edin and Zagreb and Zemun.<ref name=\"h1911\"/>\n\n==Politics==\n{{See also|Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen}}\nThe first prime minister of Hungary after the Compromise was Count [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] (1867\u20131871). The old Hungarian Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph was crowned as King of Hungary. Andr\u00e1ssy next served as the Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary (1871\u20131879).\n\nThe Empire relied increasingly on a cosmopolitan bureaucracy\u2014in which Czechs played an important role\u2014backed by loyal elements, including a large part of the German, Hungarian, Polish and Croat aristocracy.<ref name=\"Analysis: Austria's troubled history\"/>\n\n===Political struggles in the Empire===\n\nThe traditional aristocracy and land-based gentry class gradually faced increasingly wealthy men of the cities, who achieved wealth through trade and industrialization. The urban middle and upper class tended to seek their own power and supported progressive movements in the aftermath of revolutions in Europe. They were described as \"leftist liberals\" and their representatives began to be elected to the parliaments of Vienna and Budapest. These leftist liberal parliamentary parties were backed by the big industrialists, bankers, businessmen, and the predominant majority of newspaper publishers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gary B.

From the 1860s, businessmen succeeded in industrializing parts of the Empire. Newly prosperous members of the [[bourgeoisie]] erected large homes, and began to take prominent roles in urban life that rivaled the aristocracy's. In the early period, they encouraged the government to seek foreign investment to build up infrastructure, such as railroads, in aid of industrialization, transportation and communications, and development.\n[[File:Manifestace za hlasovac\u00ed pr\u00e1vo 1905.jpg|thumb|Demonstration for [[Universal suffrage|universal right to vote]] in Prague, Bohemia, 1905]]\n\nThe influence of liberals in Austria, most of them ethnic Germans, weakened under the leadership of [[Eduard Taaffe, 11th Viscount Taaffe|Count Eduard von Taaffe]], the Austrian prime minister from 1879 to 1893. Taaffe used a coalition of clergy, conservatives and Slavic parties to weaken the liberals. In [[Bohemia]], for example, he authorized [[Czech language|Czech]] as an official language of the bureaucracy and school system, thus breaking the German speakers' monopoly on holding office. Such reforms encouraged other ethnic groups to push for greater autonomy as well. By playing nationalities off one another, the government ensured the monarchy's central role in holding together competing interest groups in an era of rapid change.\n\nDuring the First World War, rising national sentiments and labour movements contributed to strikes, protests and civil unrest in the Empire. After the war, republican, national parties contributed to the disintegration and collapse of the monarchy in Austria and Hungary. Republics were established in Vienna and Budapest.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aviel Roshwald|title=Ethnic Nationalism and the Fall of Empires: Central Europe, the Middle East and Russia, 1914\u201323|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ba97xyhIZDcC&pg=PA116|year=2002|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=116}}</ref>\n\nLegislation to help the working class emerged from Catholic conservatives. They turned to social reform by using Swiss and German models and intervening in private industry.  In Germany Chancellor Otto von Bismarck had used such policies to neutralize socialist promises. The Catholics studied  the Swiss Factory Act of 1877 that limited working hours for everyone, and gave maternity benefits, and German laws that insured workers against industrial risks inherent in the workplace. These served as the basis for Austria's 1885 Trade Code Amendment.<ref>Margarete  Grandner, \"Conservative Social Politics in Austria, 1880\u20131890.\" ''Austrian History Yearbook'' 27 (1996): 77-107.</ref>\n\n===Ethnic relations===\n\n{{see also|Trialism in Austria-Hungary|United States of Greater Austria|Magyarization|Austro-Slavism|Panslavism}}\n[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Ethno-linguistic map of Austria-Hungary, 1910]]\n[[File:Meyers b12 s0486a.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]] map of Austria-Hungary, 1885]]\n[[File:Literacy in Austria-Hungary (1880).JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Literacy in Austria-Hungary (census 1880)]]\n[[File:Literacy in Hungary in the 1910s.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Literacy in Hungary by counties in 1910 (excluding Croatia)]]\n[[File:Austria1914physical.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Austria-Hungary 1914, physical]]\n\nIn July 1849, the Hungarian Revolutionary Parliament proclaimed and enacted ethnic and minority rights (the next such laws were in Switzerland), but these were overturned after the Russian and Austrian armies crushed the Hungarian Revolution. After the Kingdom of Hungary reached the Compromise with the Habsburg Dynasty in 1867, one of the first acts of its restored Parliament was to pass a Law on Nationalities (Act Number XLIV of 1868). It was a liberal piece of legislation, and offered extensive language and cultural rights. It did not recognize non-Hungarians to have rights to form states with any territorial autonomy.<ref name=\"suedosteuropa-gesellschaft\"/>\n\nThe \"Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867\" created the personal union of the independent states of Hungary and Austria, linked by under a common monarch having also joint-institutions. The Hungarian majority asserted more of their identity within the Kingdom of Hungary, and it came to conflict with some of her own minorities. The imperial power of German-speakers who controlled the Austrian half was resented by others.  In addition, the emergence of nationalism in the newly independent Romania and Serbia also contributed to ethnic issues in the empire.\n\nArticle 19 of the 1867 \"Basic State Act\" (''Staatsgrundgesetz''), valid only for the Cisleithanian (Austrian) part of Austria-Hungary,<ref name=\"verfassungen\"/> said:\n{{quote|All races of the empire have equal rights, and every race has an inviolable right to the preservation and use of its own nationality and language. The equality of all customary languages (\"{{lang|de|landes\u00fcbliche Sprachen}}\") in school, office and public life, is recognized by the state. In those territories in which several races dwell, the public and educational institutions are to be so arranged that, without applying compulsion to learn a second country language (\"{{lang|de|Landessprache}}\"), each of the races receives the necessary means of education in its own language.{{sfn|Headlam|1911|p=39}}}}\n\nThe implementation of this principle led to several disputes, as it was not clear which languages could be regarded as \"customary\". The Germans, the traditional bureaucratic, capitalist and cultural elite, demanded the recognition of their language as a customary language in every part of the empire. German nationalists, especially in the [[Sudetenland]] (part of Bohemia), looked to Berlin in the new German Empire.<ref>Solomon Wank and Barbara Jelavich, \"The Impact of the Dual Alliance on the Germans in Austria and Vice-Versa,\" ''East Central Europe'' (1980) 7#2 pp 288-309</ref>   There was a German-speaking element in Austria proper (west of Vienna), but it did not display much sense of German nationalism. That is it did not demand an independent state, rather it flourished by holding most of the high military and diplomatic offices in the Empire. \n\nItalian was regarded as an old \"culture language\" (''{{lang|de|Kultursprache}}'') by German intellectuals and had always been granted [[Social equality|equal rights]] as an [[official language]] of the Empire, but the Germans had difficulty in accepting the [[Slavic languages]] as equal to their own. On one occasion [[Count Anton Alexander von Auersperg|Count A. Auersperg]] (Anastasius Gr\u00fcn) entered the Diet of [[Carniola]] carrying what he claimed to be the whole [[text corpus|corpus]] of [[Slovene literature]] under his arm; this was to demonstrate that the [[Slovene language]] could not be substituted for German as the language of higher education.\n\nThe following years saw official recognition of several languages, at least in Austria. From 1867, laws awarded [[Croatian language|Croatian]] equal status with Italian in [[Dalmatia]]. From 1882, there was a Slovene majority in the Diet of Carniola and in the capital [[Ljubljana|Laibach (Ljubljana)]]; they ruled to replace German with Slovene as their primary official language. [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] designated Polish instead of German in 1869 as the customary language of government.\n\nThe language disputes were most fiercely fought in [[Bohemia]], where the Czech speakers formed a majority and sought equal status for their language to German. The [[Czechs]] had lived primarily in [[Bohemia]] since the 6th century and German immigrants had begun settling the Bohemian periphery since the 13th century. The constitution of 1627 made the German language a second official language and equal to Czech. German speakers lost their majority in the Bohemian Diet in 1880 and became a minority to Czech speakers in the cities of [[Prague]] and [[Plze\u0148|Pilsen]] (while retaining a slight numerical majority in the city of [[Brno|Brno (Br\u00fcnn)]]). The old [[Charles University in Prague]], hitherto dominated by German speakers, was divided into German and Czech-speaking faculties in 1882.\n\nAt the same time, Hungarian dominance faced challenges from the local majorities of [[Romanians]] in [[Transylvania]] and in the eastern [[Banat]], [[Slovaks]] in today's [[Slovakia]], and [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] in the crown lands of [[Croatia]] and of [[Dalmatia]] (today's Croatia), in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and in the provinces known as the [[Vojvodina]] (today's northern [[Serbia]]). The Romanians and the Serbs began to agitate for union with their fellow nationalists and language speakers in the newly founded states of [[Romania]] (1859\u20131878) and Serbia.\n\nHungary's leaders were generally less willing than their Austrian counterparts to share power with their subject minorities, but they granted a large measure of autonomy to [[Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia|Croatia]] in 1868. To some extent, they modelled their relation to that kingdom on their own compromise with Austria of the previous year. In spite of nominal autonomy, the Croatian government was an economic and administrative part of Hungary, which the Croatians resented. In the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Triune Kingdom of Croatia]] and Bosnia and Herzegovina many advocated the idea of a [[Trialism in Austria-Hungary|trialist Austro-Hungaro-Croatian]] monarchy among the supporters of the idea where [[Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria|Archduke Leopold Salvator]], [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] and emperor and king [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I (IV)]] who during his short reign supported the trialist idea only to be vetoed by the Hungarian government and Count [[Istvan Tisza]]. The count finally signed the trialist proclamation after heavy pressure from the king on 23 October 1918. one day after the king.<ref name=\"Budisavljevi\u0107\">Budisavljevi\u0107, Sr\u0111an, ''Stvaranje-Dr\u017eave-SHS, Creation of the state of SHS'', Zagreb, 1958, p.&nbsp;132\u2013133.</ref>\n\nLanguage was one of the most contentious issues in Austro-Hungarian politics. All governments faced difficult and divisive hurdles in deciding on the languages of government and of instruction. The minorities sought the widest opportunities for education in their own languages, as well as in the \"dominant\" languages\u2014Hungarian and German. By the \"Ordinance of 5 April 1897\", the Austrian Prime Minister [[Count Kasimir Felix Badeni]] gave Czech equal standing with German in the internal government of [[Bohemia]]; this led to a crisis because of nationalist German agitation throughout the empire. The Crown dismissed Badeni.\n\nThe Hungarian Minority Act of 1868 gave the minorities (Slovaks, Romanians, Serbs, et al.) individual (but not also communal) rights to use their language in offices, schools (although in practice often only in those founded by them and not by the state), courts and municipalities (if 20% of the deputies demanded it). From June 1907, all public and [[private school]]s in Hungary were obliged to ensure that [[Magyarization|after the fourth grade, the pupils could express themselves fluently in Hungarian]]. This led to the closing of several minority schools, devoted mostly to the Slovak and Rusyn languages.\n\nThe two kingdoms sometimes divided their [[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. According to [[Misha Glenny]] in his book, ''The Balkans, 1804\u20131999'', the Austrians responded to Hungarian support of Czechs by supporting the Croatian national movement in [[Zagreb]].\n\nIn recognition that he reigned in a multi-ethnic country, Emperor Franz Joseph spoke (and used) German, Hungarian and Czech fluently, and Croatian, Serbian, Polish and Italian to some degree.\n====Jews====\n[[Image:Orthodox Jews in Leopoldstadt 1915.JPG|thumb|Orthodox Jews from Galicia in [[Leopoldstadt]], Vienna, 1915]]\nAround 1900, Jews in the empire numbered about two million;<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vital|first1=David|title=A People Apart: A Political History of the Jews in Europe 1789-1939|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=299|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZmSV0c0f5MC&pg=PA299|isbn=0198219806}}</ref> their position was ambiguous.

To rebuild Habsburg prestige and gain revenge against Prussia, [[Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust]] became foreign secretary. He hated Prussia's diplomat, [[Otto von Bismarck]], who had repeatedly outmaneuvered him. Beust looked to France and negotiated with Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and Italy for an anti-Prussian alliance. No terms could be reached. The decisive victory of Prusso-German armies in the war of 1870 with France and the founding of the German Empire ended all hope of revenge and Beust retired.<ref>Hans A. Schmitt, \"Count Beust and Germany, 1866\u20131870: Reconquest, Realignment, or Resignation?\" ''Central European History'' (1968) 1#1 p. 20\u201334 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4545476 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nAfter being forced out of Germany and Italy, the Dual Monarchy turned to the Balkans, which were in tumult as nationalistic efforts were trying to end the rule of the Ottomans. Both Russia and Austria-Hungary saw an opportunity to expand in this region. Russia in particular took on the role of protector of the Slavs and the orthodox Christians. Austria envisioned a multi-ethnic, religiously diverse empire under Vienna's control. Count [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]], a Hungarian who was Foreign Minister (1871 to 1879), made the centerpiece of his policy one of opposition to Russian expansion in the Balkans and blocking Serbian ambitions to dominate a new South Slav federation. He wanted Germany to ally with Austria, not Russia.<ref>William L.

The [[capitalism|capitalist]] way of production spread throughout the Empire during its 50-year existences. [[Technological change]] accelerated [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]]. The first Austrian stock exchange (the [[Wiener B\u00f6rse]]) was opened in 1771 in Vienna, the first stock exchange of the Kingdom of Hungary (the [[Budapest Stock Exchange]]) was opened in Budapest in 1864.

That level of growth compared very favorably to that of other European nations such as Britain (1%), France (1.06%), and Germany (1.51%).<ref name=\"economic\"/> However, in a comparison with Germany and Britain, the Austro-Hungarian economy as a whole still lagged considerably, as sustained modernization had begun much later. Like the German Empire, that of Austria-Hungary frequently employed liberal economic policies and practices. In 1873, the old Hungarian capital Buda and \u00d3buda (Ancient Buda) were officially merged with the third city, Pest, thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into Hungary's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period. Economic growth centered on Vienna and Budapest, the Austrian lands (areas of modern Austria), the Alpine region and the Bohemian lands. In the later years of the 19th century, rapid economic growth spread to the central [[Great Hungarian Plain|Hungarian plain]] and to the Carpathian lands. As a result, wide disparities of development existed within the empire. In general, the western areas became more developed than the eastern. The Kingdom of Hungary became the world's second largest flour exporter after the United States.<ref>{{cite book\n|author=Max-Stephan Schulze|title=Engineering and Economic Growth: The Development of Austria-Hungary's Machine-Building Industry in the Late Nineteenth Century|publisher=Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang|year=1996|page=80}}</ref> The large Hungarian food exports were not limited to neighbouring Germany and Italy: Hungary became the most important foreign food supplier of the large cities and industrial centres of the United Kingdom.<ref>Commercial Relations of the United States: Reports from the Consuls of the United States on the Commerce, Manufactures, Etc., of Their Consular Districts. Publisher: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1881 (page: 371)</ref>\n\nHowever, by the end of the 19th century, economic differences gradually began to even out as economic growth in the eastern parts of the monarchy consistently surpassed that in the western. The strong agriculture and [[food industry]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] with the centre of [[Budapest]] became predominant within the empire and made up a large proportion of the export to the rest of Europe. Meanwhile, western areas, concentrated mainly around [[Prague]] and Vienna, excelled in various manufacturing industries. This [[division of labour]] between the east and west, besides the existing [[economic and monetary union]], led to an even more rapid economic growth throughout Austria-Hungary by the early 20th century. However, since the turn of the twentieth century, the Austrian half of the Monarchy could preserve its dominance within the empire in the sectors of the [[first industrial revolution]], but Hungary had a better position in the industries of the [[second industrial revolution]], in these modern sectors of the second industrial revolution the Austrian competition could not become dominant.<ref>{{cite book |first=Iv\u00e1n T. |last=Berend |author-link=Iv\u00e1n T.

Its [[predecessor state]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], had built a substantial core of railways in the west, originating from Vienna, by 1841. Austria's [[Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway|first steam railway]] from Vienna to [[Moravia]] with its terminus in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (Bochnie) was opened in 1839. The first train travelled from Vienna to Lundenburg (B\u0159eclav) on 6 June 1839 and one month later between the imperial capital in Vienna and the capital of Moravia [[Brno|Br\u00fcnn]] (Brno) on 7 July. At that point, the government realized the military possibilities of rail and began to invest heavily in construction. [[Pozsony]] ([[Bratislava]]), [[Budapest]], [[Prague]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Graz]], Laibach ([[Ljubljana]]) and [[Venice|Venedig]] ([[Venice]]) became linked to the main network. By 1854, the empire had almost {{convert|2000|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} of track, about 60\u201370% of it in state hands. The government then began to sell off large portions of track to private investors to recoup some of its investments and because of the financial strains of the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 Revolution]] and of the [[Crimean War]].\n\nFrom 1854 to 1879, private interests conducted almost all rail construction. What would become Cisleithania gained {{convert|7952|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} of track, and Hungary built {{convert|5839|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} of track. During this time, many new areas joined the railway system and the existing rail networks gained connections and interconnections. This period marked the beginning of widespread rail transportation in Austria-Hungary, and also the integration of transportation systems in the area. Railways allowed the empire to integrate its economy far more than previously possible, when transportation depended on rivers.\n\nAfter 1879, the Austrian and the Hungarian governments slowly began to renationalize their rail networks, largely because of the sluggish pace of development during the worldwide [[depression (economics)|depression]] of the 1870s. Between 1879 and 1900, more than {{convert|25000|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} of railways were built in Cisleithania and Hungary. Most of this constituted \"filling in\" of the existing network, although some areas, primarily in the far east, gained rail connections for the first time. The railway reduced transportation costs throughout the empire, opening new markets for products from other lands of the Dual Monarchy. In 1914, of a total of {{convert|22981|km|2|sp=us|abbr=on}} of railway tracks in Austria, {{convert|18859|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} (82%) were state owned.\n\n=====Railway network in the Kingdom of Hungary=====\n\nThe first Hungarian steam locomotive railway line was opened on 15 July 1846 between [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[V\u00e1c]].<ref>[[Mikulas Teich]], [[Roy Porter]], ''The Industrial Revolution in National Context: Europe and the USA'', p. 266.</ref> In 1890 most large Hungarian private railway companies were nationalized as a consequence of the poor management of private companies, except the strong Austrian-owned Kaschau-Oderberg Railway (KsOd) and the Austrian-Hungarian Southern Railway (SB/DV). They also joined the zone tariff system of the M\u00c1V (Hungarian State Railways). By 1910, the total length of the rail networks of Hungarian Kingdom reached {{convert|22,869|km|abbr=off}}, the Hungarian network linked more than 1,490 settlements. Nearly half (52%) of the empire's railways were built in Hungary, thus the railroad density there became higher than that of Cisleithania. This has ranked Hungarian railways the 6th most dense in the world (ahead of countries as Germany or France).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a9csmhIT_BQC&pg=PA149&dq=%22steel+output%22+%22austria-hungary%22|title=History Derailed: Central and Eastern Europe in the Long Nineteenth Century|author=Iv\u00e1n T.

Finally [[G\u00e1bor Baross]], Hungary's \"Iron Minister\", succeeded in financing this project. The riverbed rocks and the associated rapids made the gorge valley an infamous passage for shipping. In German, the passage is still known as the Kataraktenstrecke, even though the cataracts are gone. Near the actual \"[[Iron Gates]]\" strait the Prigrada rock was the most important obstacle until 1896: the river widened considerably here and the water level was consequently low. Upstream, the Greben rock near the \"Kazan\" gorge was notorious.\n\n=====Regulation of the Tisza River=====\n\nThe length of the [[Tisza]] in Hungary used to be {{convert|1419|km|abbr=off}}. It flowed through the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], which is one of the largest flat areas in central Europe. Since plains can cause a river to flow very slowly, the Tisza used to follow a path with many curves and turns, which led to many large floods in the area.\n\nAfter several small-scale attempts, Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi organised the \"regulation of the Tisza\" (Hungarian: a Tisza szab\u00e1lyoz\u00e1sa) which started on 27 August 1846, and substantially ended in 1880. The new length of the river in Hungary was {{convert|966|km|abbr=on}} ({{convert|1358|km|abbr=on}} total), with {{convert|589|km|abbr=on}} of \"dead channels\" and {{convert|136|km|abbr=on}} of new riverbed. The resultant length of the flood-protected river comprises {{convert|2940|km|abbr=on}} (out of {{convert|4220|km|abbr=on}} of all Hungarian protected rivers).\n\n====Shipping and ports====\n[[File:Ragusa, the Inner Gate, Dalmatia, Austro-Hungary-LCCN2002710786.jpg|thumb|[[Dubrovnik]], [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]]]\nThe first Hungarian steamship was built by Antal Bernhard in 1817, called S.S. ''Carolina''. It was also the first steamship in Habsburg ruled states.<ref name=\"Wisnovszky\">Iv\u00e1n Wisnovszky, [https://books.google.com/?id=iqpTAAAAYAAJ&q=Study+trip+to+the+Danube+Bend Study trip to the Danube Bend], Hydraulic Documentation and Information Centre, 1971, p.&nbsp;13</ref> However it was Count [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] (with the help of Austrian ship's company [[Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft|Erste Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft]] (DDSG)), who established the \u00d3buda Shipyard on the Hungarian [[Haj\u00f3gy\u00e1ri Island]] in 1835, which was the first industrial scale steamship building company in the Habsburg Empire.<ref>Victor-L. Tapie, ''The Rise and Fall of the Habsburg Monarchy'' p. 267</ref>\n\nThe most significant seaport was [[Trieste]] (today part of Italy), where the Austrian merchant marine was based. In addition, the two major shipping companies (Austrian Lloyd and Austro-Americana) and several shipyards were located there. The k.u.k. navy used the port's shipyards to construct new naval ships. This port grew as Venice declined. From 1815 to 1866, Venice was included within the monarchy and was prevented from competing with Austrian-ruled ports. The merchant marine did not develop until Venice's shipping interest declined. The navy became significant during the time of the k.u.k. monarchy, as industrialization and development provided sufficient revenues to develop it.\n\nThe most important seaport for the Hungarian part of the k.u.k. was Fiume ([[Rijeka]], today part of Croatia), where the Hungarian shipping companies, such as the Adria, operated. The largest Hungarian shipbuilding company was the Ganz-Danubius. Another significant seaport was Pola ([[Pula]], today part of Croatia) \u2013 especially for the navy. In 1889, the Austrian merchant marine consisted of 10,022 ships, with 7,992 fishing vessels. The coast and sea trade had a total of 1,859 sailboats with crews of 6,489 men and a load capacity of 140,838 tons; and 171 steamers with a load capacity of 96,323 tons and a crew of 3,199 men.\n\nThe first Danubian steamer company, Donau-Dampfschiffahrt-Gesellschaft (DDSG), was the largest inland shipping company in the world until the collapse of the k.u.k. The Austrian Lloyd was one of the biggest ocean shipping companies of the time. Prior to the beginning of World War I, the company owned 65 middle-sized and large steamers. The Austro-Americana owned one third of them, including the biggest Austrian passenger ship, the SS ''Kaiser Franz Joseph I''. In comparison to the Austrian Lloyd, the Austro-American concentrated on destinations in North and South America.<ref name=\"dradio\"/><ref name=\"theshipslist\"/><ref name=\"dame\"/><ref name=\"aeiou\"/><ref name=\"www\"/><ref name=\"danube\"/>\n\n===Telecommunication===\n\n====Telegraph====\nIn 1847, the first telegraph connection (Vienna \u2013 Brno \u2013 Prague) started operation.<ref>Paula Sutter Fichtner: Historical Dictionary of Austria (p.&nbsp;69)</ref> The first telegraph station on Hungarian territory was opened in December 1847 in Pressburg/ Pozsony /[[Bratislava]]/.

Side by side with these existed private schools. The proportion of children attending private schools to those attending the public elementary schools in 1912 was 144,000 to 4.5 millions, i.e. a thirtieth part. Hence the accusation of denationalizing children through the Schulvereine must be accepted with caution. The expenses of education were distributed as follows: the communes built the schoolhouses, the political sub-districts (Bezirke) paid the teachers, the Crown territory gave a grant, and the State appointed the inspectors. Since the State supervised the schools without maintaining them, it was able to increase its demands without being hampered by financial considerations. It is remarkable that the difference between the State educational estimates in Austria and in Hungary was one of 9.3 millions in the former as opposed to 67.6 in the latter. Under Austria, since everywhere that 40 scholars of one nationality were to be found within a radius of 5&nbsp;km. a school had to be set up in which their language was used, national schools were assured even to linguistic minorities. It is true that this mostly happened at the expense of the German industrial communities, since the Slav labourers as immigrants acquired schools in their own language. The number of elementary schools increased from 19,016 in two to 24,713 in 1913; the number of scholars from 3,490,000 in 1900 to 4,630,000 in 1913.<ref>Austrian Empire article of E. Britannica 1911</ref>\n\n'''Universities in Austrian Empire'''\n\nThe first University in the Austrian half of the Empire ([[Charles University]]) was founded by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|H.R. Emperor Charles IV]] in Prague in 1347. The second oldest university ([[University of Vienna]]) was founded by [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria|Duke Rudolph IV]] in 1365.\n\nThe higher educational establishments, which in the middle of the 19th century had had a predominantly German character, underwent in Galicia a conversion into Polish national institutions, in Bohemia and Moravia a separation into German and Czech ones. Thus Germans, Czechs and Poles were provided for. But now the smaller nations also made their voices heard: the Ruthenians, Slovenes and Italians. The Ruthenians demanded at first, in view of the predominantly Ruthenian character of East Galicia, a national partition of the Polish university existing there. Since the Poles were at first unyielding, Ruthenian demonstrations and strikes of students arose, and the Ruthenians were no longer content with the reversion of a few separate professorial chairs, and with parallel courses of lectures. By a pact concluded on 28 January 1914 the Poles promised a Ruthenian university; but owing to the war the question lapsed. The Italians could hardly claim a university of their own on grounds of population (in 19to they numbered 783,000), but they claimed it all the more on grounds of their ancient culture. All parties were agreed that an Italian faculty of laws should be created; the difficulty lay in the choice of the place. The Italians demanded Trieste; but the Government was afraid to let this Adriatic port become the centre of an irredenta; moreover the Southern Slavs of the city wished it kept free from an Italian educational establishment. Bienerth in 1910 brought about a compromise; namely, that it should be founded at once, the situation to be provisionally in Vienna, and to be transferred within four years to Italian national territory. The German National Union (Nationalverband) agreed to extend temporary hospitality to the Italian university in Vienna, but the Southern Slav Hochschule Club demanded a guarantee that a later transfer to the coast provinces should not be contemplated, together with the simultaneous foundation of Slovene professorial chairs in Prague and Cracow, and preliminary steps towards the foundation of a Southern Slav university in Laibach. But in spite of the constant renewal of negotiations for a compromise it was impossible to arrive at any agreement, until the outbreak of war left all the projects for a Ruthenian university at Lemberg, a Slovene one in Laibach, and a second Czech one in Moravia, unrealized.\n\n==== Kingdom of Hungary ====\n\n'''Primary and secondary schools'''\n\nOne of the first measures of newly established Hungarian government was to provide supplementary schools of a non-denominational character. By a law passed in 1868 attendance at school is obligatory on all children between the ages of 6 and 12 years. The communes or parishes are bound to maintain elementary schools, and they are entitled to levy an additional tax of 5% on the state taxes for their maintenance. But the number of state-aided elementary schools is continually increasing, as the spread of the Magyar language to the other races through the medium of the elementary schools is one of the principal concerns of the Hungarian government, and is vigorously pursued.' In 1902 there were in Hungary 18,729 elementary schools with 32,020 teachers, attended by 2,573,377 pupils, figures which compare favourably with those of 1877, when there were 15,486 schools with 20,717 teachers, attended by 1,559,636 pupils. In about 61% of these schools the language used was exclusively Magyar, in about 6 20% it was mixed, and in the remainder some non-Magyar language was used. In 1902, 80.56% of the children of school age actually attended school. Since 1891 infant schools, for children between the ages of 3 and 6 years, have been maintained either by the communes or by the state.\n\nThe public instruction of Hungary contains three other groups of educational institutions: middle or secondary schools, \" high schools \" and technical schools. The middle schools comprise classical schools (gymnasia) which are preparatory for the universities and other \" high schools,\" and modern schools (Realschulen) preparatory for the technical schools. Their course of study is generally eight years, and they are maintained mostly by the state. The state-maintained gymnasia are mostly of recent foundation, but some schools maintained by the various churches have been in existence for three, or sometimes four, centuries. The number of middle schools in 1902 was 243 with 4705 teachers, attended by 71,788 pupils; in 1880 their number was 185, attended by 40,747 pupils.\n\n'''Universities in Kingdom of Hungary'''\n\nIn the year 1276, the university of Veszpr\u00e9m was destroyed by the troops of P\u00e9ter Cs\u00e1k and it was never rebuilt. A university was established by [[Louis I of Hungary]] in P\u00e9cs in 1367. Sigismund established a university at \u00d3buda in 1395. Another, Universitas Istropolitana, was established 1465 in Pozsony (now Bratislava in Slovakia) by [[Mattias Corvinus]]. None of these medieval universities survived the Ottoman wars. Nagyszombat University was founded in 1635 and moved to Buda in 1777 and it is called E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University today. The world's first institute of technology was founded in Selmecb\u00e1nya, Kingdom of Hungary (since 1920 Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica, now Slovakia) in 1735. Its legal successor is the University of Miskolc in Hungary. The Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME) is considered the oldest institute of technology in the world with university rank and structure. Its legal predecessor the Institutum Geometrico-Hydrotechnicum was founded in 1782 by Emperor Joseph II.\n\nThe high schools include the universities, of which Hungary possesses Five, all maintained by the state: at Budapest (founded in 1635), at Kolozsv\u00e1r (founded in 1872), and at Zagreb (founded in 1874). Newer universities were established in Debrecen in 1912, and Pozsony university was reestablished after a half millennium in 1912. They have four faculties: of theology, law, philosophy and medicine (the university at Zagreb was without a faculty of medicine). There are besides ten high schools of law, called academies, which in 1900 were attended by 1569 pupils. The Polytechnicum in Budapest, founded in 1844, which contains four faculties and was attended in 1900 by 1772 pupils, is also considered a high school. There were in Hungary in 1900 forty-nine high theological colleges, twenty-nine Catholic; five Greek Uniat, four Greek Orthodox, ten Protestant and one Jewish. Among special schools the principal mining schools are at Selmeczb\u00e1nya, Nagy\u00e1g and Fels\u0151b\u00e1nya; the principal agricultural colleges at Debreczen and Kolozsv\u00e1r; and there are a school of forestry at Selmeczb\u00e1nya, military colleges at Budapest, Kassa, D\u00e9va and Zagreb, and a naval school at Fiume. There are besides an adequate number of training institutes for teachers, a great number of schools of commerce, several art schools \u2013 for design, painting, sculpture, music.\n\n==Military==\n{{main|Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian Air Force|Military Frontier}}\n[[File:KuK Infanterie 1898.jpg|thumb|k.u.k.

Its military force was composed of the [[common army]]; the special armies, namely the [[Austrian Landwehr]], and the [[Hungarian Honved]], which were separate national institutions, and the [[Landsturm]] or levy-en masse. As stated above, the common army stood under the administration of the joint minister of war, while the special armies were under the administration of the respective ministries of national defence. The yearly contingent of recruits for the army was fixed by the military bills voted on by the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, and was generally determined on the basis of the population, according to the last census returns. It amounted in 1905 to 103,100 men, of which Austria furnished 59,211 men, and Hungary 43,889. Besides 10,000 men were annually allotted to the Austrian Landwehr, and 12,500 to the Hungarian Honved. The term of service was two years (three years in the cavalry) with the colours, seven or eight in the reserve and two in the Landwehr; in the case of men not drafted to the active army the same total period of service was spent in various special reserves.<ref name=\"Headlam 1911, p. 3\">{{EB1911 |inline=1 |last=Headlam |first=James Wycliffe |year=1911b |wstitle=Austria-Hungary |volume=3 |page=3}}</ref>\n\nThe common minister of war was the head for the administration of all military affairs, except those of the Austrian Landwehr and of the Hungarian Honved, which were committed to the ministries for national defence of the two respective states. But the supreme command of the army was nominally vested in the monarch, who had the power to take all measures regarding the whole army.  In practice the emperor's nephew Archduke Albrecht was his chief military advisor and made the policy decisions. <ref name=\"Headlam 1911, p. 3\"/>\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian navy was mainly a coast defence force, and also included a flotilla of monitors for the Danube.

With help from Romania and Greece, Russia defeated the Ottomans and with the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] tried to create a large pro-Russian Bulgaria. This treaty sparked an international uproar that almost resulted in a general European war. Austria-Hungary and Britain feared that a large Bulgaria would become a Russian satellite that would enable the tsar to dominate the Balkans. British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli moved warships into position against Russia to halt the advance of Russian influence in the eastern Mediterranean so close to Britain's route through the [[Suez Canal]].<ref>Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1973) CH 6</ref>\n\n[[File:Archduke Eugen Bosniaks.jpg|thumb|left|Recruits from Bosnia-Herzegovina, including Muslim [[Bosniaks]] (31%), were drafted into [[Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry|special units]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] as early as 1879 and were commended for their bravery in service of the Austrian emperor, winning more medals than any other unit.

Austria occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina as a way of gaining clout in the Balkans. Serbia, Montenegro and Romania became fully independent. Nonetheless the Balkans remained a site of political unrest with teeming ambition for independence and great power rivalries. At the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] (Minister of Foreign Affairs) managed to force Russia to retreat from further demands in the Balkans. As a result, [[Greater Bulgaria]] was broken up and Serbian independence was guaranteed.<ref name=\"B\"/> In that year, with Britain's support, Austria-Hungary stationed troops in Bosnia to prevent the Russians from expanding into nearby Serbia. In another measure to keep the Russians out of the Balkans Austria-Hungary formed an alliance, the Mediterranean Entente, with Britain and Italy in 1887 and concluded mutual defence pacts with Germany in 1879 and Romania in 1883 against a possible Russian attack.<ref name=\"webcitation\"/> Following the Congress of Berlin the European powers attempted to guarantee stability through a complex series of alliances and treaties.\n\nAnxious about Balkan instability and Russian aggression, and to counter French interests in Europe, Austria-Hungary forged a [[defensive alliance]] with Germany in October 1879 and in May 1882. In October 1882 Italy joined this partnership in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] largely because of Italy's imperial rivalries with France.

In performance of this promise a constitution was promulgated in 1910. This included a Territorial Statute (Landesstatut) with the setting up of a Territorial Diet, regulations for the election and procedure of the Diet, a law of associations, a law of public meetings, and a law dealing with the district councils. According to this statute Bosnia-Herzegovina formed a single administrative territory under the responsible direction and supervision of the Ministry of Finance of the Dual Monarchy in Vienna. The administration of the country, together with the carrying out of the laws, devolved upon the Territorial Government in Sarajevo, which was subordinate and responsible to the Common Ministry of Finance. The existing judicial and administrative authorities of the Territory retained their previous organization and functions. That statute introduced the modern rights and laws in Bosnia \u2013 Herzegovina, and it guaranteed generally the civil rights of the inhabitants of the Territory, namely citizenship, personal liberty, protection by the competent judicial authorities, liberty of creed and conscience, preservation of the national individuality and language, freedom of speech, freedom of learning and education, inviolability of the domicile, secrecy of posts and telegraphs, inviolability of property, the right of petition, and finally the right of holding meetings.<ref>Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1973) pp&nbsp;259\u201372</ref>\n\nThe Diet (Sabor) of Bosnia-Herzegovina set up consisted of a single Chamber, elected on the principle of the representation of interests.

Of these 20 consisted of representatives of all the religious confessions, the president of the Supreme Court, the president of the Chamber of Advocates, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, and the mayor of Sarajevo. In addition to these were 72 deputies, elected by three curiae or electoral groups. The first curia included the large landowners, the highest taxpayers, and people who had reached a certain standard of education without regard to the amount they paid in taxes. To the second curia belonged inhabitants of the towns not qualified to vote in the first; to the third, country dwellers disqualified in the same way. With this curial system was combined the grouping of the mandates and of the electors according to the three dominant creeds (Catholic, Serbian Orthodox, Muslim).

About an hour later, when Franz Ferdinand was returning from a visit at the Sarajevo Hospital, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where [[Gavrilo Princip]] by coincidence stood. With a pistol, Princip shot and killed Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie. The reaction among the Austrian people was mild, almost indifferent. As historian Z. A. B.

The empire had lost ethnic Italian areas to [[Piedmont]] because of nationalist movements that had swept through Italy, and many Austro-Hungarians perceived as imminent the threat of losing to [[Serbia]] the southern territories inhabited by Slavs. Serbia had recently gained considerable territory in the [[Second Balkan War]] of 1913, causing much distress in government circles in Vienna and Budapest. Former ambassador and foreign minister Count [[Alois Aehrenthal]] had assumed that any future war would be in the Balkan region.\n\nHungarian prime minister and political scientist [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]] opposed the expansion of the monarchy in the Balkans (see [[Bosnian crisis]] in 1908) because \"the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs\", which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.<ref>William Jannen: Lions of July: Prelude to War, 1914 \u2013 PAGE:456</ref> In March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Franz Joseph with a strongly apocalyptic, predictive and embittered tone. He used the hitherto unknown word \"Weltkrieg\" (meaning World War). \"It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.\" <ref>David G.

They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking Serbia. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to Emperor Franz Joseph saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war.<ref>Fischer, Fritz: Germany\u2019s Aims in the First World War, New York, W.W. Norton, 1967, {{ISBN|9780393097986}}, p. 52</ref> He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics.

The hog population fell 90 percent, as the dwindling supplies of ham and bacon percent of the Army. Hungary, with its heavy agricultural base, was somewhat better fed. The Army conquered productive agricultural areas in Romania and elsewhere, but refused to allow food shipments to civilians back home.  Morale fell every year, and the diverse nationalities gave up on the Empire and looked for ways to establish their own nation states.<ref>Maureen Healy, ''Vienna and the Fall of the Habsburg Empire: Total War and Everyday Life in World War I'' (2007)</ref>\n\nInflation soared, from an index of 129 in 1914 to 1589 in 1918, wiping out the cash savings of the middle-class. In terms of war damage to the economy, the war used up about 20 percent of the GDP. The dead soldiers amounted to about four percent of the 1914 labor force, and the wounded ones to another six percent. Compared all the major countries in the war, Austria's death and casualty rate was toward the high-end.<ref name=\"Schulze2005\"/>\n\nBy summer 1918, \"Green Cadres\" of army deserters formed armed bands in the hills of Croatia-Slavonia and civil authority disintegrated.  By late October violence and massive looting erupted and there were efforts to form peasant republics.

Franz Joseph I, who was much too old to command the army, appointed [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Friedrich von \u00d6sterreich-Teschen]] as Supreme Army Commander (Armeeoberkommandant), but asked him to give Von H\u00f6tzendorf freedom to take any decisions. Von H\u00f6tzendorf remained in effective command of the military forces until Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]] took the supreme command himself in late 1916 and dismissed Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf in 1917. Meanwhile, economic conditions on the homefront deteriorated rapidly. The Empire depended on agriculture, and agriculture depended on the heavy labor of millions of men who are now in the Army. Food production fell, the transportation system became overcrowded, and industrial production could not successfully handle the overwhelming need for munitions. Germany provided a great deal of help, but it was not enough. Furthermore, the political instability of the multiple ethnic groups of Empire now ripped apart any hope for national consensus in support of the war. Increasingly there was a demand for breaking up the Empire and setting up autonomous national states based on historic language-based cultures. The new Emperor sought peace terms from the Allies, but his initiatives were vetoed by Italy.<ref>Alexander Watson, ''Ring of Steel: Germany and Austria-Hungary in World War I'' (2014), [https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Steel-Germany-Austria-Hungary-World-ebook/dp/B00JZBA9MO/ excerpt]</ref>\n\n====Serbian front 1914\u20131916====\n{{main|Serbian Campaign (World War I)}}\nAt the start of the war, the army was divided in two: the smaller part attacked Serbia while the larger part fought against the formidable [[Imperial Russian Army]]. The invasion of Serbia in 1914 was a disaster: by the end of the year, the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] had taken no territory, but had lost 227,000 out of a total force of 450,000 men. However, in the autumn of 1915, the Serbian Army was defeated by the Central Powers, which led to the occupation of Serbia. Near the end of 1915, in a massive rescue operation involving more than 1,000 trips made by Italian, French and British steamers, 260,000 Serb soldiers were transported to [[Corfu]], where they waited for the chance of the victory of Allied Powers to reclaim their country. Corfu hosted the Serbian government in exile after the collapse of Serbia, and served as a supply base to the Greek front. In April 1916 a large number of Serbian troops were transported in British and French naval vessels from Corfu to mainland Greece. The contingent numbering over 120,000 relieved a much smaller army at the [[Macedonian Front]] and fought alongside British and French troops.<ref name=\"history1\"/>\n\n====Russian front 1914\u20131917====\n{{main|Eastern Front (World War I)}}\n[[File:Szturm Twierdzy Przemysl A. Ritter von Meissl.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Siege of Przemy\u015bl]] in 1915]]\nOn the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern front]], the war started out equally poorly. The Austro-Hungarian Army was defeated at the [[Battle of Galicia|Battle of Lemberg]] and the great fortress city of [[Siege of Przemy\u015bl|Przemy\u015bl was besieged]] and fell in March 1915. The [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive]] started as a minor German offensive to relieve the pressure of the Russian numerical superiority on the Austro-Hungarians, but the cooperation of the Central Powers resulted in huge Russian losses and the total collapse of the Russian lines, and their {{convert|100|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} long retreat into Russia. The Russian Third Army perished. In summer 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Army, under a unified command with the Germans, participated in the successful [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive]]. From June 1916, the Russians focused their attacks on the Austro-Hungarian army in the [[Brusilov Offensive]], recognizing the numerical inferiority of the Austro-Hungarian army. By the end of September 1916, Austria-Hungary mobilized and concentrated new divisions, and the successful Russian advance was halted and slowly repelled; but the Austrian armies took heavy losses (about 1 million men) and never recovered. The [[Battle of Zborov (1917)]] was the first significant action of the [[Czechoslovak Legions]], who fought for the independence of Czechoslovakia against the Austro-Hungarian army. However the huge losses in men and material inflicted on the Russians during the offensive contributed greatly to the [[Russian Revolution|revolutions of 1917]], and it caused an economic crash in the [[Russian Empire]].\n\n====Italian front 1915\u20131918====\n{{main|Italian Front (World War I)}}\n[[File:Trento 3 novembre 1918.jpg|thumb|Italian troops in [[Trento]] on November 3, 1918, after the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]].

Italy was the only military opponent of Austria-Hungary which had a similar degree of industrialization and economic level; moreover, her army was numerous (~1,000,000 men were immediately fielded), but suffered from poor leadership, training and organization. [[Chief of Staff]] [[Luigi Cadorna]] marched his army towards the [[Isonzo]] river, hoping to seize [[Ljubljana]], and to eventually threaten Vienna. However, the [[Royal Italian Army]] were halted on the river, where [[Battles of the Isonzo|four battles]] took place over five months (23 June \u2013 2 December 1915). The fight was extremely bloody and exhausting for both the contenders.<ref>John R. Schindler, ''Isonzo: The Forgotten Sacrifice of the Great War'' (2001)</ref>\n\nOn 15 May 1916, the Austrian Chief of Staff Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf launched the ''[[Battle of Asiago|Strafexpedition]]'' (\"[[punitive expedition]]\"): the Austrians broke through the opposing front and occupied the [[Asiago plateau]]. The Italians managed to resist and in a counteroffensive seized [[Gorizia]] on 9 August. Nonetheless, they had to stop on the [[Carso]], a few kilometres away from the border. At this point, several months of indecisive [[trench warfare]] ensued (analogous to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western front]]). As the Russian Empire collapsed as a result of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] and [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Russians ended their involvement in the war]], Germans and Austrians were able to move on the Western and Southern fronts much manpower from the erstwhile Eastern fighting.\n\nOn 24 October 1917, Austrians (now enjoying decisive German support) attacked at [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]] using new infiltration tactics; although they advanced more than {{convert|100|km|2|sp=us|abbr=on}} in the direction of [[Venice]] and gained considerable supplies, they were halted and could not cross the [[Piave (river)|Piave]] river. Italy, although suffering massive casualties, recovered from the blow, and a [[coalition government]] under [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] was formed. Italy also enjoyed support by the Entente powers: by 1918, large amounts of war materials and a few auxiliary American, British, and French divisions arrived in the Italian battle zone.<ref>Gaetano V.

The multiethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire started to disintegrate, leaving its army alone on the battlefields. The final battle was at [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]; after 4 days of stiff resistance, Italian troops crossed the Piave River, and after losing 90,000 men the defeated Austrian troops retreated in disarray pursued by the Italians. The Italians captured 428,000 Austrian-Hungarian soldiers,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 24 of whom were generals,<ref>Pier Paolo Cervone, ''Vittorio Veneto, l'ultima battaglia'', Milano, Mursia, 1993.</ref> 5,600 cannons and mortars, and 4,000 [[Heavy machine guns|machine guns]].<ref>[[Indro Montanelli]]; Mario Cervi, ''Due secoli di guerre'', VII, Novara, Editoriale Nuova, 1981.</ref> The military breakdown also marked the start of the rebellion for the numerous ethnicities who made up the multiethnic Empire, as they refused to keep on fighting for a cause which now appeared senseless. These events marked the end of Austria-Hungary, which collapsed on 31 October 1918. The armistice was signed at [[Armistice of Villa Giusti|Villa Giusti]] on 3 November.\n\n====Romanian front 1916====\n{{main|Romania during World War I}}\nOn 27 August 1916, [[Romania]] declared war against Austria-Hungary. The [[Romanian Land Forces|Romanian Army]] crossed the borders of Eastern Hungary ([[Transylvania]]). By November 1916, the Central Powers had defeated the Romanian Army and occupied the southern and eastern parts of Romania. On 6 December the Central Powers captured [[Bucharest]], the Romanian capital city.<ref>Glenn E. Torrey, ''Romania and World War I'' (Histria Books, 1998)</ref>\n\nWhereas the German army realized it needed close cooperation from the homefront, Habsburg officers saw themselves as entirely separate from the civilian world, and superior to it. When they occupied productive areas, such as Romania{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}, they seized food stocks and other supplies for their own purposes, and blocked any shipments intended for civilians back in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The result was that the officers lived well, as the civilians began to starve. Vienna even transferred training units to Serbia and Poland for the sole purpose of feeding them. In all, the Army obtained about 15 percent of its cereal needs from occupied territories.<ref>Watson, ''Ring of Steel'' p 396-97</ref>\n\n===Role of Hungary===\n[[File:Cs\u00edkp\u00e1lfalva2.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|right|War memorial in [[P\u0103uleni-Ciuc]], Romania.]]\n\nAlthough the Kingdom of Hungary composed only 42% of the population of Austria-Hungary,<ref>See: 1910 census</ref> the thin majority \u2013 more than 3.8 million soldiers \u2013 of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces were conscripted from the Kingdom of Hungary during the First World War.

However, this failed as Britain and France no longer had any regard for the integrity of the monarchy because of Austro-Hungarian support for Germany.<ref name=\"B\"/>\n\n===Analysis of defeat===\nThe setbacks that the Austrian army suffered in 1914 and 1915 can be attributed to a large extent to Austria-Hungary becoming a military satellite of [[Imperial Germany]] from the first day of the war. They were made worse by the incompetence of the Austrian high command.<ref name=\"B\"/> After attacking Serbia, its forces soon had to be withdrawn to protect its eastern frontier against Russia's invasion, while German units were engaged in fighting on [[Western Front (World War I)|the Western Front]]. This resulted in a greater than expected loss of men in the invasion of Serbia.<ref name=\"B\"/> Furthermore, it became evident that the Austrian high command had had no plans for a possible continental war and that the army and navy were also ill-equipped to handle such a conflict.<ref name=\"B\"/>\n\nFrom 1916, the Austro-Hungarian war effort became more and more subordinated to the direction of German planners. The Austrians viewed the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]] favorably, on the other hand by 1916 the general belief in Germany was that Germany, in its alliance with Austria-Hungary, was \"shackled to a corpse\". The operational capability of the Austro-Hungarian army was seriously affected by supply shortages, low morale and a high casualty rate, and by the army's composition of multiple ethnicities with different languages and customs.\n\nThe last two successes for the Austrians, the Romanian Offensive and the Caporetto Offensive, were German-assisted operations. As the Dual Monarchy became more politically unstable, it became more and more dependent on German assistance. The majority of its people, other than Hungarians and German Austrians, became increasingly restless.\n\nIn 1917, the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern front]] of the Entente Powers completely collapsed.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries. By 1918, the economic situation had deteriorated. Leftist and pacifist political movements organized strikes in factories, and uprisings in the army had become commonplace. During the Italian battles, the Czechoslovaks and Southern Slavs declared their independence. On 31 October Hungary ended the personal union with Austria, officially dissolving the Monarchy. At the last Italian offensive, the Austro-Hungarian Army took to the field without any food and munition supply, and fought without any political supports for a ''de facto'' non-existent empire. On the end of the decisive joint Italian, British and French offensive at Vittorio Veneto, the disintegrated Austria-Hungary signed the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] on 3 November 1918.\n\nThe government had failed badly on the homefront. Historian Alexander Watson reports:\n{{quote|across central Europe&nbsp;... The majority lived in a state of advanced misery by the spring of 1918, and conditions later worsened, for the summer of 1918 saw both the drop in food supplied to the levels of the '[[turnip winter]]', and the onset of the [[1918 flu pandemic]] that killed at least 20 million worldwide. Society was relieved, exhausted and yearned for peace.<ref>Alexander Watson, ''Ring of Steel: Germany and Austria-Hungary in World War I'' (2014), p 536</ref>}}\n\n==Dissolution==\nThe Austro-Hungarian Monarchy collapsed with dramatic speed in the autumn of 1918. In the capital cities of Vienna and Budapest, the leftist and liberal movements and politicians (the opposition parties) strengthened and supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. These leftist or left-liberal pro-Entente maverick parties opposed the monarchy as a form of government and considered themselves internationalist rather than patriotic. Eventually, the German defeat and the minor revolutions in Vienna and Budapest gave political power to the left/liberal political parties. As it became apparent that the Allied powers would win World War I, nationalist movements, which had previously been calling for a greater degree of autonomy for various areas, started pressing for full independence. The Emperor had lost much of his power to rule, as his realm disintegrated.<ref>Watson, ''Ring of Steel'' pp 536\u201340</ref>\n\nAlexander Watson argues that, \"The Habsburg regime's doom was sealed when Wilson's response to the note, sent two and a half weeks earlier, arrived on 20 October.\" Wilson rejected the continuation of the dual monarchy as a negotiable possibility.<ref>Watson, ''Ring of Steel'' pp 541\u20132</ref> As one of his [[Fourteen Points]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]] demanded that the nationalities of Austria-Hungary have the \"freest opportunity to autonomous development\". In response, Emperor Karl I agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament in 1917 and allow the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However, the leaders of these national groups rejected the idea; they deeply distrusted Vienna and were now determined to get independence.\n\n[[File:Poprava v\u016fdc\u016f rumbursk\u00e9 vzpoury 1918.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The revolt of ethnic [[Czechs|Czech]] units in Austria in May 1918 was brutally suppressed. It was considered as [[mutiny]] by the code of [[military justice]]]]\nOn 14 October 1918, Foreign Minister [[Istv\u00e1n Buri\u00e1n|Baron Istv\u00e1n Buri\u00e1n von Rajecz]]<ref name=\"mfa\"/> asked for an armistice based on the Fourteen Points. In an apparent attempt to demonstrate good faith, Emperor Karl issued a proclamation (\"Imperial Manifesto of 16 October 1918\") two days later which would have significantly altered the structure of the Austrian half of the monarchy. The Polish majority regions of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Lodomeria]] were to be granted the option of seceding from the empire, and it was understood that they would join their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in resurrecting a Polish state. The rest of [[Cisleithania]] was transformed into a federal union composed of four parts\u2014German, Czech, South Slav and Ukrainian. Each of these was to be governed by a national council that would negotiate the future of the empire with Vienna. [[Trieste]] was to receive a special status. No such proclamation could be issued in Hungary, where Hungarian aristocrats still believed they could subdue other nationalities and maintain the \"Holy Kingdom of St. Stephen\".\n\nIt was a dead letter. Four days later, on 18 October United States Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]] replied that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, Lansing said, autonomy for the nationalities \u2013 the tenth of the Fourteen Points \u2013 was no longer enough and Washington could not deal on the basis of the Fourteen Points anymore. In fact, a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak provisional government]] had joined the Allies on 14 October. The South Slavs in both halves of the monarchy had already declared in favor of uniting with Serbia in a large South Slav state by way of the 1917 [[Corfu Declaration]] signed by members of the [[Yugoslav Committee]]. Indeed, the Croatians had begun disregarding orders from Budapest earlier in October.\n\nThe Lansing note was, in effect, the death certificate of Austria-Hungary. The national councils had already begun acting more or less as provisional governments of independent countries. With defeat in the war imminent after the Italian offensive in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto on 24 October, Czech politicians peacefully took over command in Prague on 28 October (later declared the birthday of Czechoslovakia) and followed up in other major cities in the next few days. On 30 October, the Slovaks followed in [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]]. On 29 October, the Slavs in both portions of what remained of Austria-Hungary proclaimed the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. They also declared their ultimate intention was to unite with Serbia and Montenegro in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|a large South Slav state]]. On the same day, the Czechs and Slovaks formally proclaimed the establishment of Czechoslovakia as an independent state.\n\nIn Hungary, the most prominent opponent of continued union with Austria, Count [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]], seized power in the [[Aster Revolution]] on 31 October. Charles was all but forced to appoint K\u00e1rolyi as his Hungarian prime minister. One of K\u00e1rolyi's first acts was to cancel the compromise agreement, officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state.\n\nBy the end of October, there was nothing left of the Habsburg realm but its majority-German Danubian and Alpine provinces, and Karl's authority was being challenged even there by the German-Austrian state council.<ref>Watson, ''Ring of Steel'' pp 542\u201356</ref> Karl's last Austrian prime minister, [[Heinrich Lammasch]], concluded that Karl was in an impossible situation, and persuaded Karl that the best course was to relinquish, at least temporarily, his right to exercise sovereign authority.\n\n===Consequences===\nOn 11 November, Karl issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people's right to determine the form of the state. He also renounced the right to participate in Austrian affairs of state. He also dismissed Lammasch and his government from office and released the officials in the Austrian half of the empire from their oath of loyalty to him. Two days later, he issued a similar proclamation for Hungary. However, he did not abdicate, remaining available in the event the people of either state should recall him. For all intents and purposes, this was the end of Habsburg rule.\n\nKarl's refusal to abdicate was ultimately irrelevant. On the day after he announced his withdrawal from Austria's politics, the German-Austrian National Council proclaimed the [[Republic of German Austria]].  K\u00e1rolyi followed suit on 16 November, proclaiming the [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]].\n\nThe [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] (between the victors of World War I and Austria) and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] (between the victors and Hungary) regulated the new borders of Austria and Hungary, leaving both as small landlocked states. The Allies assumed without question that the minority nationalities wanted to leave Austria and Hungary, and also allowed them to annex significant blocks of German- and Hungarian-speaking territory. As a result, the [[First Austrian Republic|Republic of Austria]] lost roughly 60% of the old [[Austrian Empire]]'s territory. It also had to drop its plans for union with Germany, as it was not allowed to unite with Germany without League approval. The [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|restored Kingdom of Hungary]], which had replaced the republican government in 1920, lost roughly 72% of the pre-war territory of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\nThe decisions of the nations of the former Austria-Hungary and of the victors of the Great War, contained in the heavily one-sided treaties, had devastating political and economic effects. The previously rapid economic growth of the Dual Monarchy ground to a halt because the new borders became major economic barriers. All the formerly well-established industries, as well as the infrastructure supporting them, were designed to satisfy the needs of an extensive realm. As a result, the emerging countries were forced to make considerable sacrifices to transform their economies. The treaties created major political unease. As a result of these economic difficulties, extremist movements gained strength; and there was no regional superpower in central Europe.\n\nThe new Austrian state was, at least on paper, on shakier ground than Hungary. While what was left of Austria had been a single unit for over 700 years, it was united only by loyalty to the Habsburgs. With the loss of 60% of the Austrian Empire's prewar territory, [[Vienna]] was now an imperial capital without an empire to support it. By comparison, Hungary had been a nation and a state for over 900 years. However, after a brief period of upheaval and the Allies' foreclosure of union with Germany, Austria established itself as a federal republic. Despite the temporary ''[[Anschluss]]'' with [[Nazi Germany]], it still survives today.

The Hungarian Democratic Republic was short-lived and was temporarily replaced by the communist [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]. Romanian troops ousted [[B\u00e9la Kun]] and his communist government during the [[Hungarian\u2013Romanian War of 1919]].\n\nIn the summer of 1919, a Habsburg, [[Archduke Joseph August of Austria|Archduke Joseph August]], became regent, but was forced to stand down after only two weeks when it became apparent the Allies would not recognise him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Die amtliche Meldung \u00fcber den R\u00fccktritt|publisher=[[Neue Freie Presse]], Morgenblatt|date=1919-08-24|page=2|language=German|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?apm=0&aid=nfp&datum=19190824&seite=2&zoom=2}}</ref> Finally, in March 1920, royal powers were entrusted to a [[regent]], [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], who had been the last commanding [[admiral]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] and had helped organize the counter-revolutionary forces.

The initially wavering Horthy, after receiving threats of intervention from the Allied Powers and neighboring countries, refused his cooperation. Soon afterward, the Hungarian government nullified the Pragmatic Sanction, effectively dethroning the Habsburgs. Two years later, Austria had passed the \"[[Habsburg Law]],\" which not only dethroned the Habsburgs, but banned Karl from ever returning to Austria again.\n\nSubsequently, the British took custody of Karl and removed him and his family to the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]], where he died the following year.\n\n====Successor states====\n{{Main|Treaty of Trianon|Treaty of Saint Germain}}\n\nThe following [[successor state]]s were formed (entirely or in part) on the territory of the former Austria-Hungary:\n* [[German Austria]] and [[First Austrian Republic]]\n* [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]], [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Kingdom of Hungary]]\n* [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czecho-Slovakia]] (\"Czechoslovakia\" from 1920 to 1938)\n* [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] (joined on 1 December 1918 with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]])\n* [[Second Polish Republic]]\n* [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] (united with the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] through [[Act Zluky]], while its territory was fully overran by the [[Second Polish Republic]])\n* Duchy of [[Bukovina]] and [[Transylvania]] were joined to the [[Kingdom of Romania]]\n\nAustro-Hungarian lands were also ceded to the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]].

They put into effect the terms of the [[Treaty of Union]] that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries. By the two Acts, the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]{{mdash}}which at the time were separate [[sovereign state|states]] with separate legislatures, but [[Personal union|with the same monarch]]{{mdash}}were, in the words of the Treaty, \"United into One Kingdom by the Name of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]\".<ref>Article I of the Treaty of Union</ref>\n\nThe two countries had shared a monarch since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, when [[King James VI of Scotland]] inherited the English throne from his [[double first cousin]] twice removed, [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head (as opposed to the implied creation of a single Crown and a single Kingdom, exemplified by the later [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]).

Under the aegis of the Queen and her ministers in both kingdoms, the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed to participate in fresh negotiations for a union treaty in 1705.\n\nBoth countries appointed 31 commissioners to conduct the negotiations.

Each side had its own particular concerns.

Opponents of the court were generally known as the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country party]], and included various factions and individuals such as the [[Duke of Hamilton]], [[Lord Belhaven]] and [[Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun]], who spoke forcefully and passionately against the union.

In April 1707, he travelled to London to attend celebrations at the royal court, and was greeted by groups of noblemen and gentry lined along the road. From [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]], the route was lined with crowds of cheering people, and once he reached London a huge crowd had formed. On 17 April, the Duke was gratefully received by the Queen at [[Kensington Palace]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_union.html | title = 1 May 1707 \u2013 the Union comes into effect | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224036/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_union.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Political motivations ==\n[[File:QueenAnne1702.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Queen Anne in 1702, the year she became queen, from the school of [[John Closterman]]]]\n\nThe Acts of Union should be seen within a wider European context of increasing state centralisation during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. This included the monarchies of France, Sweden, Denmark and Spain. While there were exceptions such as the [[Dutch Republic]] or the [[Republic of Venice]], the trend was clear.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Munck |first1=Thomas |title=Seventeenth-Century Europe: State, Conflict and Social Order in Europe 1598-1700 |date=2005 |publisher=Palgrave |isbn=978-1403936196 |pages=429\u2013431}}</ref> \n\nThe dangers of the monarch using one Parliament against the other became apparent in the wars of 1647 and 1651 and resurfaced during the [[Exclusion Crisis]]. English resistance to the Catholic [[James II of England|James]] succeeding his brother Charles resulted in him being sent to Edinburgh in 1681 as [[Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland|Lord High Commissioner]]. In August, the Scottish Parliament passed the Succession Act, confirming the divine right of kings, the rights of the natural heir 'regardless of religion,' the duty of all to swear allegiance to that king and the independence of the Scottish Crown. It then went beyond ensuring James's succession to the Scottish throne by explicitly stating the aim was to make his exclusion from the English throne impossible without '...the fatall and dreadfull consequences of a civil war.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=Clare |title=Restoration Scotland, 1660-1690: Royalist Politics, Religion and Ideas |date=2003 |publisher=Boydell Press |isbn=978-0851159300 |pages=38\u201354}}</ref> \n\nThe issue reappeared during the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]]. Contrary to what is often assumed, the English Parliament generally supported the replacement of James with his Protestant daughter [[Mary II]] but strongly resisted making her Dutch husband [[William III & II]] joint ruler. They only gave way when he threatened to return to the Netherlands and Mary refused to rule without him.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horwitz |first1=Henry |title=Parliament, Policy and Politics in the Reign of William III. |date=1986 |publisher=MUP |isbn=978-0719006616 |pages=10\u201311}}</ref> \n\nIn Scotland, conflict over control of the kirk between Presbyterians and Episcopalians and William's position as a fellow Calvinist put him in a much stronger position. Originally, William insisted on retaining Episcopacy in the kirk and the Committee of the Articles, an unelected body that controlled what legislation Parliament could debate. Both of these would have given the Crown far greater control than in England but he withdrew his demands due to the 1689-1692 Jacobite Rising.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=Michael|title=Scotland, A New History|date=1992|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0712698931|pages=300\u2013303}}</ref>\n\n=== English perspective ===\nThe English purpose was to ensure that Scotland would not choose a monarch different from the one on the English throne. The two countries had shared a king for much of the previous century, but the English were concerned that an independent Scotland with a different king, even if he were a Protestant, might make alliances against England. The English succession was provided for by the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which ensured that the monarch of England would be a Protestant member of the [[House of Hanover]]. Until the Union of Parliaments, the Scottish throne might be inherited by a different successor after [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]: the Scottish [[Act of Security 1704]] granted parliament the right to choose a successor and explicitly required a choice different from the English monarch unless the English were to grant free trade and navigation. Many people in England were unhappy about the prospect, however. [[English overseas possessions]] made England very wealthy in comparison to Scotland, a poor country with few roads, very little industry and almost no Navy. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}} This made some view unification as a markedly unequal relationship.\n\n=== Scottish perspective ===\n\nIn Scotland, some claimed that union would enable Scotland to recover from the financial disaster wrought by the [[Darien scheme]] through English assistance and the lifting of measures put in place through the [[Alien Act 1705|Alien Act]] to force the Scottish Parliament into compliance with the Act of Settlement.<ref>{{Cite book |first=C.

Many Commissioners had invested heavily in the Darien scheme and they believed that they would receive compensation for their losses; Article 15 granted [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]398,085 10[[Shilling|s]] sterling to Scotland, a sum known as [[The Equivalent]], to offset future liability towards the English national debt. In essence it was also used as a means of compensation for investors in the Company of Scotland's Darien scheme, as 58.6% was allocated to its shareholders and creditors.<ref>Watt, Douglas.

Popular unrest occurred in Edinburgh, as mentioned above, with some lesser but still substantial riots in Glasgow. The people of Edinburgh demonstrated against the treaty, and their apparent leader in opposition to the Unionists was [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton]]. However, Hamilton was actually on the side of the English Government. Demonstrators in Edinburgh were opposed to the Union for many reasons: they feared the Kirk would be Anglicised; that Anglicisation would remove democracy from the only really elementally democratic part of the Kingdom; and they feared that tax rises would come.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A People's History of Scotland|last=Bambery|first=Chris|publisher=Verso|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[George Lockhart (politician)|Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath]], the only member of the Scottish negotiating team against union, noted that \"The whole nation appears against the Union\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/devolution/scotland/briefing/1707.shtml |title=Scottish Referendums |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 March 2016}}</ref> and even Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, an ardent pro-unionist and Union negotiator, observed that the treaty was \"contrary to the inclinations of at least three-fourths of the Kingdom\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Public opinion against the Treaty as it passed through the Scottish Parliament was voiced through petitions from shires, burghs, presbyteries and parishes.

It also created a [[customs union]] and [[monetary union]].\n\nThe Act provided that any \"laws and statutes\" that were \"contrary to or inconsistent with the terms\" of the Act would \"cease and become void\".\n\n===Related Acts===\n\nThe Scottish Parliament also passed the [[Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707]] guaranteeing the status of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The English Parliament passed a similar Act, 6 Anne c.8.\n\nSoon after the Union, the Act 6 Anne c.40{{mdash}}later named the [[Union with Scotland (Amendment) Act 1707]]{{mdash}}united the English and Scottish [[Privy Council]]s and decentralised Scottish administration by appointing justices of the peace in each shire to carry out administration. In effect it took the day-to-day government of Scotland out of the hands of politicians and into those of the [[College of Justice]].\n\nIn the year following the Union, the [[Treason Act 1708]] abolished the Scottish law of [[High treason in the United Kingdom#History: after union with Scotland|treason]] and extended the corresponding English law across Great Britain.\n\n== Evaluations ==\nScotland benefited, says historian G.N. Clark, gaining \"freedom of trade with England and the colonies\" as well as \"a great expansion of markets\". The agreement guaranteed the permanent status of the Presbyterian church in Scotland, and the separate system of laws and courts in Scotland.  Clark argued that in exchange for the financial benefits and bribes that England bestowed, what it gained was\n\n<blockquote>of inestimable value. Scotland accepted the Hanoverian succession and gave up her power of threatening England's military security and complicating her commercial relations ... The sweeping successes of the eighteenth-century wars owed much to the new unity of the two nations.<ref>G.N. Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660\u20131714'' (2nd ed. 1956) pp 290\u201393.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the time [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[James Boswell]] made their tour in 1773, recorded in ''[[A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland]]'', Johnson noted that Scotland was \"a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending, and the wealth increasing\" and in particular that [[Glasgow]] had become one of the greatest cities of Britain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon Brown|title=My Scotland, Our Britain: A Future Worth

Originally exercised by a single person, the [[List of Lord High Admirals (United Kingdom)|Lord High Admiral]] (1385\u20131628), the Admiralty was, from the early 18th century onwards, almost invariably put \"in commission\" and exercised by the [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty]], who sat on the [[Board of Admiralty]].\n\nIn 1964, the functions of the Admiralty were transferred to a new [[Admiralty Board (United Kingdom)|Admiralty Board]], which is a committee of the tri-service [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom]] and part of the [[Navy Department (MOD)|Navy Department]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Archives|first1=The National|title=Admiralty, and Ministry of Defence, Navy Department: Correspondence and Papers|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1710|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk|publisher=National Archives, 1660\u20131976, ADM 1|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref> of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].

King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] established the Council of the Marine\u2014later to become the [[Navy Board]]\u2014in 1546, to oversee administrative affairs of the naval service. Operational control of the [[Royal Navy]] remained the responsibility of the Lord High Admiral, who was one of the nine [[Great Officers of State]].\n\nKing [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] put the office of Lord High Admiral into commission in 1628, and control of the Royal Navy passed to a committee in the form of the [[Board of Admiralty]]. The office of Lord High Admiral passed a number of times in and out of commission until 1709, after which the office was almost permanently in commission (the last Lord High Admiral being the future King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] in the early 19th century).\n\nThe first Navy Board was abolished as a separate entity in 1831, and its duties and responsibilities were given over to the Admiralty.\n\nIn 1964, the Admiralty\u2014along with the [[War Office]] and the [[Air Ministry]]\u2014were abolished as separate departments of state, and placed under one single new [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. Within the expanded Ministry of Defence are the new [[Admiralty Board (United Kingdom)|Admiralty Board]] which has a separate [[Navy Board (1964-present)|Navy Board]] responsible for the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy, the [[Army Board]] and the [[Air Force Board]], each headed by the [[Secretary of State for Defence]].\n\n===Board of Admiralty===\n[[File:Board Room of Admiralty Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|[[Board of Admiralty]], about 1810]]\n\nWhen the office of Lord High Admiral was in commission, as it was for most of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, until it reverted to [[the Crown]], it was exercised by a Board of Admiralty, officially known as the ''Commissioners for Exercising the Office of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, &c.'' (alternatively of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] or the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] depending on the period).\n\nThe Board of Admiralty consisted of a number of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. The Lords Commissioners were always a mixture of [[admiral]]s, known as [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|Naval Lords or Sea Lords]] and Civil Lords, normally politicians. The [[quorum]] of the Board was two commissioners and a secretary.\n\nThe president of the Board was known as the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], who was a member of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. After 1806, the First Lord of the Admiralty was always a civilian, while the professional head of the navy came to be (and is still today) known as the [[First Sea Lord]].\n\n===Organization===\n{{see|Admiralty in the 16th century|Admiralty in the 17th century|Admiralty in the 18th century|Admiralty in the 19th century|Admiralty in the 20th century}}\n\nThe first real concerted effort to professionally organize the Admiralty was started by Henry VIII. This management approach would continue in force in the Royal Navy until to 1832. In this organization a dual system operated the Lord High Admiral (from 1546) then Commissioners of the Admiralty (from 1628) exercised the function of general control (military administration) of the Navy and they were usually responsible for the conduct of any war, while the actual supply lines, support and services were managed by four principal officers, namely, the [[Treasurer of the Navy|Treasurer]], [[Comptroller of the Navy (Navy Board)|Comptroller]], [[Surveyor of the Navy|Surveyor]] and [[Clerk of the Acts]], responsible individually for [[finance]], supervision of [[account (accountancy)|account]]s, [[Shipbuilding]] and maintenance of ships, and record of business. These principal officers came to be known as the [[Navy Board]] responsible for 'civil administration' of the navy, from 1546 to 1832.\n\nThis structure of administering the navy lasted for 285 years, however, the supply system was often inefficient and corrupt its deficiencies were due as much to its limitations of the times they operated in. The various functions within the Admiralty were not coordinated effectively and lacked inter-dependency with each other, with the result that in 1832, [[Sir James Graham]] abolished the Navy Board and merged its functions within those of the Board of Admiralty. At the time this had distinct advantages; however, it failed to retain the principle of distinctions between the Admiralty and supply, and a lot of bureaucracy followed with the merger.\n\nIn 1860 saw big growth in the development of technical crafts, the expansion of more admiralty branches that really began with [[Naval tactics in the Age of Steam|age of steam]] that would have an enormous influence on the navy and naval thought.\n\nBetween 1860 and 1908, there was no real study of strategy and of staff work conducted within the [[Her Majesty's Naval Service|naval service]]; it was practically ignored. All the Navy's talent flowed to the great technical universities. This school of thought for the next 50 years was exclusively technically based. The first serious attempt to introduce a sole management body to administer the naval service manifested itself in the creation of the [[Admiralty Navy War Council]] in 1909.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Paul|title=The War Plans of the Great Powers (RLE The First World War): 1880\u20131914|date=Apr 24, 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317702528|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dbtwAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA128&dq=Admiral+Fisher+Naval+War+Council#v=onepage&q=Admiral%20Fisher%20Naval%20War%20Council&f=false|language=en}}</ref> It was believed by officials within the Admiralty at this time that the running of war was quite a simple matter for any flag officer who required no formal training. However, this mentality would be severely questioned with the advent of the [[Agadir crisis]], when the Admiralty's war plans were heavily criticized. Following this, a new advisory body called the [[Admiralty War Staff]] was then instituted in 1912, headed by the Chief of the War Staff who was responsible for administering three new sub-divisions responsible for [[Operations Division|operations]], [[Naval Intelligence Division|intelligence]] and [[Mobilisation Division (Royal Navy)|mobilisation]]. The new War Staff had hardly found its feet and it continually struggled with the opposition to its existence by senior officers they were categorically opposed to a staff. The deficiencies of the system within this [[department of state]] could be seen in the conduct of the [[Dardanelles campaign]]. There were no mechanisms in place to answer the big strategic questions. A [[Trade Division (Royal Navy)|Trade Division]] was created in 1914.\n\n[[Sir John Jellicoe]] came to the Admiralty in 1916. He re-organized the war staff as following: Chief of War Staff, Operations, Intelligence, [[Signal Division (Royal Navy)|Signal Section]], Mobilisation, Trade.\n\nIt was not until 1917 that the admiralty department was again properly reorganized and began to function as a professional [[Staff (military)|military staff]]. In May 1917, the term \"Admiralty War Staff\" was renamed and that department and its functional role were superseded by a new \"[[Admiralty Naval Staff]]\"; in addition, the newly created office of Chief of the Naval Staff was merged in the office of the First Sea Lord. Also appointed was a new post, that of [[Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff]], and an [[Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff]]; all were given seats on the Board of Admiralty. This for the first time gave the [[Admiralty Naval Staff|naval staff]] direct representation on the board; the presence of three senior naval senior members on the board ensured the necessary authority to carry through any operation of war. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff would direct all operations and movements of the fleet, while the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff would be responsible for mercantile movements and anti-submarine operations.\n\nThe office of [[Third Sea Lord|Controller]] would be re-established to deal with all questions relating to supply; on 6 September 1917, a [[Deputy First Sea Lord]], was added to the Board who would administer operations abroad and deal with questions of foreign policy. In October 1917, the development of the staff was carried one step further by the creation of two sub-committees of the Board\u2014the Operations Committee and the Maintenance Committee. The First Lord of the Admiralty was chairman of both committees, and the Operations Committee consisted of the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, the Deputy First Sea Lord, Assistant Chief of Naval Staff, and [[Fifth Sea Lord]]. The Maintenance Committee consisted of the Deputy First Sea Lord (representing the operations committee), [[Second Sea Lord]] (personnel), [[Third Sea Lord]] ([[materiel]]), [[Fourth Sea Lord]] (transport and stores), [[Civil Lord of the Admiralty (Royal Navy)|Civil Lord]], Controller and [[Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty|Financial Secretary]].\n\nFull operational control of the Royal Navy was finally handed over to the Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) by an [[order in Council]], effective October 1917, under which he became responsible for the issuing of orders affecting all [[Military operation|war operations]] directly to the fleet. It also empowered the CNS to issue orders in their own name, as opposed to them previously being issued by the [[Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty]] in the name of the Board. This structure remained in place until the department was abolished in 1964; the operational control and this system still remains in place with the Royal Navy today.

Since the Admiralty no longer exists as a department, these buildings are now used by separate government departments:\n\n===The Admiralty===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[The Admiralty]] -->\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Ripley Building]] -->\nThe oldest building was long known simply as ''The Admiralty''; it is now known officially as the Ripley Building, a three-storey U-shaped brick building designed by [[Thomas Ripley (architect)|Thomas Ripley]] and completed in 1726. [[Alexander Pope]] implied the architecture is rather dull, lacking either the vigour of the [[baroque]] style, fading from fashion at the time, or the austere grandeur of the [[Palladian]] style just coming into vogue. It is mainly notable for being perhaps the first purpose-built office building in Great Britain. It contained the Admiralty board room, which is still used by the Admiralty, other state rooms,  offices and apartments for the Lords of the Admiralty. [[Robert Adam]] designed the screen, which was added to the entrance front in 1788. The Ripley Building is currently occupied by the [[Department for International Development]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Admiralty office Whitehall 1760 D Cunego.jpg|Old Admiralty (Ripley Building) in 1760 before addition of the Adam screen\nFile:Admiralty_building_Whitehall_1790.jpg|Old Admiralty (Ripley Building) c. 1790 after addition of the Adam screen\nFile:Admiraliteit london 1830.jpg|Old Admiralty (Ripley Building) c. 1830\n</gallery>\n\n===Admiralty House===\n[[Admiralty House, London|Admiralty House]] is a moderately proportioned mansion to the south of the Ripley Building, built in the late 18th century as the residence of the First Lord of the Admiralty from 1788. It served that purpose until 1964. [[Winston Churchill]] was one of its occupants in 1911\u20131915 and 1939\u20131940. It lacks its own entrance from Whitehall and is entered through the Ripley Courtyard or Ripley Building. It is a three-storey building in yellow brick with [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] interiors. Its rear facade faces directly onto Horse Guards Parade.

It is a red brick building with white stone, detailing in the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] with French influences. It has been used by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] from the 1960s to 2016.

The muscles are transected, and finally, the [[bone]] is sawed through with an [[oscillating saw]]. Sharp and rough edges of the bone(s) are filed down, skin and muscle flaps are then transposed over the stump, occasionally with the insertion of elements to attach a [[prosthesis]].\n\nDistal stabilisation of muscles is recommended. This allows effective muscle contraction which reduces atrophy, allows functional use of the stump and maintains soft tissue coverage of the remnant bone. The preferred stabilisation technique is myodesis where the muscle is attached to the bone or its periostium. In joint disarticulation amputations tenodesis may be used where the muscle tendon is attached to the bone.

In the USA, a typical prosthetic limb costs in the range of $10,000\u201315,000 according to the American Diabetic Association<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://brentmthompson.com/amputations/|title=Amputations - Law Office of Brent M Thompson, Esq.|website=brentmthompson.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>. In some populations, preventing amputations is a critical task.\n\nMethods in preventing amputation, [[limb-sparing techniques]], depend on the problems that might cause amputations to be necessary. Chronic infections, often caused by diabetes or [[decubitus]] ulcers in bedridden patients, are common causes of infections that lead to gangrene, which would then necessitate amputation.\n\nThere are two key challenges: first, many patients have impaired circulation in their extremities, and second, they have difficulty curing infections in limbs with poor vasculation (blood circulation).\n \nCrush injuries where there is extensive tissue damage and poor circulation also benefit from [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (HBOT). The high level of oxygenation and revascularization speed up recovery times and prevent infections.\n\nA study found that the patented method called Circulator Boot achieved significant results in prevention of amputation in patients with diabetes and arterioscleorosis.<ref name=dillon1>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bouskela E, Donyo KA | title = Effects of oral administration of purified micronized flavonoid fraction on increased microvascular permeability induced by various agents and on ischemia/reperfusion in the hamster cheek pouch | journal = Angiology | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 391\u20139 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9158383 | doi = 10.1177/000331979704800503 | url = http://www.circulatorboot.com/literature/angiology1.html | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/5uKem3IM2?url=http://www.circulatorboot.com/literature/angiology1.html | df =  | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 2010-11-18 | access-date = 2010-06-24 }}</ref><ref name=dillon2>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dillon RS | title = Patient assessment and examples of a method of treatment.

These limbs can itch, ache, burn, feel tense, dry or wet, locked in or trapped or they can feel as if they are moving. Some scientists believe it has to do with a kind of neural map that the brain has of the body, which sends information to the rest of the brain about limbs regardless of their existence. Phantom sensations and phantom pain may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs, e.g. after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain) or removal of an eye ([[phantom eye syndrome]]).\n\nA similar phenomenon is unexplained sensation in a body part unrelated to the amputated limb. It has been hypothesized that the portion of the brain responsible for processing stimulation from amputated limbs, being deprived of input, expands into the surrounding brain, (''[[Phantoms in the Brain]]'': [[V.S. Ramachandran]] and [[Sandra Blakeslee]]) such that an individual who has had an arm amputated will experience unexplained pressure or movement on his face or head{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.\n\nIn many cases, the phantom limb aids in adaptation to a prosthesis, as it permits the person to experience [[proprioception]] of the prosthetic limb. To support improved resistance or usability, comfort or healing, some type of [[stump sock]]s may be worn instead of or as part of wearing a prosthesis.\n\nAnother side effect can be [[heterotopic ossification]], especially when a bone injury is combined with a head injury. The brain signals the bone to grow instead of scar tissue to form, and nodules and other growth can interfere with prosthetics and sometimes require further operations. This type of injury has been especially common among soldiers wounded by [[improvised explosive device]]s in the [[Iraq War]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/26/MNSOLDIERS26.DTL |title=War without end / Damaged soldiers start their agonizing recoveries |first=Joan |last=Ryan | name-list-format = vanc |date=March 25, 2006 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKeplkmD?url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2006%2F03%2F26%2FMNSOLDIERS26.DTL |archive-date=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>\n\nDue to technologic advances in prosthetics, many amputees live active lives with little restriction.

The term is derived from the Greek word ''anemos'', which means [[wind]], and is used to describe any wind speed instrument used in [[meteorology]]. The first known description  of an anemometer was given by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] in 1450.\n\n==History==\nThe anemometer has changed little since its development in the 15th century. [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404\u20131472) is said to have invented the first mechanical anemometer around 1450. In following centuries, numerous others, including [[Robert Hooke]]\n(1635\u20131703), developed their own versions, with some being mistakenly credited as the inventor. In 1846, [[John Thomas Romney Robinson]] (1792\u20131882) improved upon the design by using four hemispherical cups and mechanical wheels. In 1926, Canadian meteorologist [[John Patterson (meteorologist)|John Patterson]] (January 3, 1872 \u2013 February 22, 1956) developed a three-cup anemometer, which was improved by Brevoort and Joiner in 1935. In 1991, [[Derek Weston]] added the ability to measure wind direction. In 1994, [[Andrews Pflitsch]] developed the sonic anemometer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logicenergy.com/articles/history-anemometer/|title=History of the Anemometer|publisher=Logic Energy|access-date=14 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity anemometers==\n\n===Cup anemometers===\n[[File:Cup-Anemometer-Animation.gif|thumb|right|Cup anemometer animation]]\nA simple type of anemometer was invented in 1845 by Dr. [[John Thomas Romney Robinson]], of [[Armagh Observatory]]. It consisted of four [[hemispherical]] cups mounted on horizontal arms, which were mounted on a vertical shaft. The air flow past the cups in any horizontal direction turned the shaft at a rate that was roughly proportional to the wind speed. Therefore, counting the turns of the shaft over a set time interval produced a value proportional to the average wind speed for a wide range of speeds. It is also called a rotational anemometer.\n\nOn an anemometer with four cups, it is easy to see that since the cups are arranged symmetrically on the end of the arms, the wind always has the hollow of one cup presented to it and is blowing on the back of the cup on the opposite end of the cross. Since a hollow hemisphere has a [[drag coefficient]] of .38 on the spherical side and 1.42 on the hollow side,<ref>{{Citation|url=https://doc-0c-ac-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/ha0ro937gcuc7l7deffksulhg5h7mbp1/s7aiua40ikv6hnfbpqppab412ps8c66a/1519704000000/08405723359066499286/*/0Bx0MqOfev7dnTnB0eFRIN2JQb0k?e=download|title=Sighard Hoerner's Fluid Dynamic Drag|pages=3\u201317, Figure 32|publication-date=1965}}</ref> more force is generated on the cup that is presenting its hollow side to the wind. Because of this asymmetrical force, torque is generated on the axis of the anemometer, causing it to spin.\n\nTheoretically, the speed of rotation of the anemometer should be proportional to the wind speed, because the force produced on an object is proportional to the speed of the fluid flowing past it, but other factors influence the rotational speed, including turbulence produced by the apparatus, increasing drag in opposition to the torque that is produced by the cups and support arms, and friction of the mount point. When Robinson first designed his anemometer, he asserted that the cups moved one-third of the speed of the wind, unaffected by the cup size or arm length. This was apparently confirmed by some early independent experiments, but it was incorrect. Instead, the ratio of the speed of the wind and that of the cups, the ''anemometer factor'', depends on the dimensions of the cups and arms, and may have a value between two and a little over three. Every previous experiment involving an anemometer had to be repeated after the error was discovered.\n\nThe three-cup anemometer developed by the Canadian [[John Patterson (meteorologist)|John Patterson]] in 1926 and subsequent cup improvements by Brevoort & Joiner of the United States in 1935 led to a cupwheel design with a nearly linear response and had an error of less than 3% up to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Patterson found that each cup produced maximum torque when it was at 45\u00b0 to the wind flow. The three-cup anemometer also had a more constant torque and responded more quickly to gusts than the four-cup anemometer.\n\nThe three-cup anemometer was further modified by the Australian Dr. Derek Weston in 1991 to measure both wind direction and wind speed. Weston added a tag to one cup, which causes the cupwheel speed to increase and decrease as the tag moves alternately with and against the wind. Wind direction is calculated from these cyclical changes in cupwheel speed, while wind speed is determined from the average cupwheel speed.\n\nThree-cup anemometers are currently used as the industry standard for [[wind resource assessment]] studies & practice.\n\n===Vane anemometers===\nOne of the other forms of mechanical velocity anemometer is the ''vane anemometer''. It may be described as a [[windmill]] or a propeller anemometer. Unlike the Robinson anemometer, whose axis of rotation is vertical, the vane anemometer must have its axis parallel to the direction of the wind and therefore horizontal. Furthermore, since the wind varies in direction and the axis has to follow its changes, a [[weather vane|wind vane]] or some other contrivance to fulfill the same purpose must be employed.\n\nA ''vane anemometer'' thus combines a propeller and a tail on the same axis to obtain accurate and precise wind speed and direction measurements from the same instrument.<ref name= WMO>{{cite web|url=http://www.eumetcal.org/resources/ukmeteocal/rapid_cyclo/www/english/glossary/vaneanem.htm|title=Vane anemometer|author=[[World Meteorological Organization]]|work=Eumetcal|access-date=6 April 2014}}</ref> The speed of the fan is measured by a rev counter and converted to a windspeed by an electronic chip. Hence, volumetric flow rate may be calculated if the cross-sectional area is known.\n\nIn cases where the direction of the air motion is always the same, as in ventilating shafts of mines and buildings, wind vanes known as air meters are employed, and give satisfactory results.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n<gallery caption=\"Vane anemometers\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Wind speed and direction instrument - NOAA.jpg|Vane style of anemometer\nFile:Prop vane anemometer.jpg|[[Helicoid]] propeller anemometer incorporating a [[wind vane]] for orientation\nFile:Anemometer-IMG 4734-white.jpg|Hand-held low-speed vane anemometer\nFile:Digital_Handheld_Anemometer.jpg|Hand-held digital anemometer\n</gallery>\n\n===Hot-wire anemometers===\n[[File:Hd sonde.jpg|thumb|left|Hot-wire sensor]]\nHot wire anemometers use a very fine wire (on the order of several micrometres) electrically heated to some temperature above the ambient. Air flowing past the wire cools the wire. As the electrical resistance of most metals is dependent upon the temperature of the metal ([[tungsten]] is a popular choice for hot-wires), a relationship can be obtained between the resistance of the wire and the flow speed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efunda.com/designstandards/sensors/hot_wires/hot_wires_intro.cfm|title=Hot-wire Anemometer explanation|publisher=eFunda|access-date=18 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010125307/http://www.efunda.com/DesignStandards/sensors/hot_wires/hot_wires_intro.cfm |archivedate=10 October 2006|deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nSeveral ways of implementing this exist, and hot-wire devices can be further classified as CCA ([[constant current]] anemometer), CVA ([[Voltage source|constant voltage]] anemometer) and CTA (constant-temperature anemometer). The voltage output from these anemometers is thus the result of some sort of circuit within the device trying to maintain the specific variable (current, voltage or temperature) constant, following [[Ohm's law]].\n\nAdditionally, PWM ([[pulse-width modulation]]) anemometers are also used, wherein the velocity is inferred by the time length of a repeating pulse of current that brings the wire up to a specified resistance and then stops until a threshold \"floor\" is reached, at which time the pulse is sent again.\n\nHot-wire anemometers, while extremely delicate, have extremely high frequency-response and fine spatial resolution compared to other measurement methods, and as such are almost universally employed for the detailed study of turbulent flows, or any flow in which rapid velocity fluctuations are of interest.\n\nAn industrial version of the fine-wire anemometer is the [[Thermal mass flow meter|thermal flow meter]], which follows the same concept, but uses two pins or strings to monitor the variation in temperature. The strings contain fine wires, but encasing the wires makes them much more durable and capable of accurately measuring air, gas, and emissions flow in pipes, ducts, and stacks. Industrial applications often contain dirt that will damage the classic hot-wire anemometer.\n\n[[File:Laser anemometer.png|thumb|360px|Drawing of a laser anemometer. The laser light is emitted (1) through the front lens (6) of the anemometer and is backscattered off the air molecules (7). The backscattered radiation (dots) re-enters the device and is reflected and directed into a detector (12).]]\n\n===Laser Doppler anemometers===\nIn [[laser Doppler velocimetry]], laser Doppler anemometers use a beam of light from a [[laser]] that is divided into two beams, with one propagated out of the anemometer. Particulates (or deliberately introduced seed material) flowing along with air molecules near where the beam exits reflect, or backscatter, the light back into a detector, where it is measured relative to the original laser beam. When the particles are in great motion, they produce a [[Doppler shift]] for measuring wind speed in the laser light, which is used to calculate the speed of the particles, and therefore the air around the anemometer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Iten|first=Paul D.|date=29 June 1976|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=3966324|title=Laser Doppler Anemometer|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|access-date=18 September 2006}}</ref>\n[[File:Ultrasonic Windsensor.png|thumb|2D ultrasonic anemometer with 3 paths]]\n\n===Ultrasonic anemometers===\n[[File:WindMaster.jpg|thumb|3D ultrasonic anemometer]]\nUltrasonic anemometers, first developed in the 1950s, use [[ultrasound|ultrasonic sound waves]] to measure wind velocity. They measure wind speed based on the time of flight of sonic pulses between pairs of [[transducer]]s. Measurements from pairs of transducers can be combined to yield a measurement of velocity in 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional flow. The [[spatial resolution]] is given by the path length between transducers, which is typically 10 to 20 [[centimeter|cm]]. Ultrasonic anemometers can take measurements with very fine [[temporal resolution]], 20 [[hertz|Hz]] or better, which makes them well suited for [[turbulence]] measurements. The lack of moving parts makes them appropriate for long-term use in exposed automated weather stations and weather buoys where the accuracy and reliability of traditional cup-and-vane anemometers are adversely affected by salty air or dust. Their main disadvantage is the distortion of the air flow by the structure supporting the transducers, which requires a correction based upon wind tunnel measurements to minimize the effect. An international standard for this process, [[ISO 16622]] ''Meteorology\u2014Ultrasonic anemometers/thermometers\u2014Acceptance test methods for mean wind measurements'' is in general circulation. Another disadvantage is lower accuracy due to precipitation, where rain drops may vary the [[speed of sound]].\n\nSince the speed of sound varies with temperature, and is virtually stable with pressure change, ultrasonic anemometers are also used as [[thermometers]].\n\nTwo-dimensional (wind speed and wind direction) sonic anemometers are used in applications such as [[weather station]]s, ship navigation, aviation, [[weather buoy]]s and wind turbines. Monitoring wind turbines usually requires a refresh rate of wind speed measurements of 3&nbsp;Hz,<ref>{{cite book |last=Giebhardt |first=Jochen |editor-last1=Dalsgaard S\u00f8rensen |editor-first1=John |editor-last2=N S\u00f8rensen |editor-first2=Jens |title=Wind Energy Systems: Optimising design and construction for safe and reliable operation |publisher=Elsevier |date=December 20, 2010 |pages=329\u2013349 |chapter=Chapter 11: Wind turbine condition monitoring systems and techniques |isbn=9780857090638 }}</ref> easily achieved by sonic anemometers. Three-dimensional sonic anemometers are widely used to measure gas emissions and ecosystem fluxes using the [[eddy covariance]] method when used with fast-response [[infrared gas analyzer]]s or [[laser]]-based analyzers.\n\nTwo-dimensional wind sensors are of two types:\n* '''Two ultrasounds paths''': These sensors have four arms. The disadvantage of this type of sensor is that when the wind comes in the direction of an ultrasound path, the arms disturb the airflow, reducing the accuracy of the resulting measurement.\n* '''Three ultrasounds paths''': These sensors have three arms. They give one path redundancy of the measurement which improves the sensor accuracy and reduces aerodynamic turbulence.\n\n====Acoustic resonance anemometers====\n[[File:Acoustic Resonance Wind Sensor.jpg|thumb|left|Acoustic resonance anemometer]]\nAcoustic resonance anemometers are a more recent variant of sonic anemometer. The technology was invented by Dr Savvas Kapartis and patented in 2000.<ref>European Patent No. EPO 801311 A and USA Patent No. 5,877,416 (1999)</ref> Whereas conventional sonic anemometers rely on time of flight measurement, acoustic resonance sensors use resonating acoustic (ultrasonic) waves within a small purpose-built cavity in order to perform their measurement.\n\n[[File:Acoustic Resonance Anemometer.jpg|thumb|Acoustic resonance principle]]\nBuilt into the cavity is an array of ultrasonic transducers, which are used to create the separate standing-wave patterns at ultrasonic frequencies. As wind passes through the cavity, a change in the wave's property occurs (phase shift). By measuring the amount of phase shift in the received signals by each transducer, and then by mathematically processing the data, the sensor is able to provide an accurate horizontal measurement of wind speed and direction.\n\nAcoustic resonance technology enables measurement within a small cavity, the sensors therefore tend to be typically smaller in size than other ultrasonic sensors. The small size of acoustic resonance anemometers makes them physically strong and easy to heat and therefore resistant to icing. This combination of features means that they achieve high levels of data availability and are well suited to wind turbine control and to other uses that require small robust sensors such as battlefield meteorology. One issue with this sensor type is measurement accuracy when compared to a calibrated mechanical sensor. For many end uses, this weakness is compensated for by the sensor's longevity and the fact that it does not require re-calibrating once installed.\n\n===Ping-pong ball anemometers===\nA common anemometer for basic use is constructed from a [[ping-pong ball]] attached to a string. When the wind blows horizontally, it presses on and moves the ball; because ping-pong balls are very lightweight, they move easily in light winds. Measuring the angle between the string-ball apparatus and the vertical gives an estimate of the wind speed.\n\nThis type of anemometer is mostly used for middle-school level instruction, which most students make on their own, but a similar device was also flown on [[Phoenix Mars Lander#Meteorological station|Phoenix Mars Lander]].<ref>[http://marslab.au.dk/research/instrument-development/the-telltale-project/ \"The Telltale project.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220080017/http://www.marslab.dk/TelltaleProject.html |date=20 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Pressure anemometers==\n[[File:Britannia Yacht Club tour, burgee, and wind gauge.jpg|thumb|right|[[Britannia Yacht Club]] clubhouse tour, burgee, and wind gauge on roof]]\nThe first designs of anemometers that measure the pressure were divided into plate and tube classes.\n\n===Plate anemometers===\nThese are the first modern anemometers. They consist of a flat plate suspended from the top so that the wind deflects the plate. In 1450, the Italian art architect Leon Battista Alberti invented the first mechanical anemometer; in 1664 it was re-invented by Robert Hooke (who is often mistakenly considered the inventor of the first anemometer). Later versions of this form consisted of a flat plate, either square or circular, which is kept normal to the wind by a wind vane. The pressure of the wind on its face is balanced by a spring. The compression of the spring determines the actual force which the wind is exerting on the plate, and this is either read off on a suitable gauge, or on a recorder. Instruments of this kind do not respond to light winds, are inaccurate for high wind readings, and are slow at responding to variable winds. Plate anemometers have been used to trigger high wind alarms on bridges.\n\n===Tube anemometers===\n[[File:Tube anemometer invented by William Henry Dines.jpg|thumb|left|Tube anemometer invented by William Henry Dines. The movable part (right) is mounted on the fixed part (left).]]\n[[File:Instruments at Mount Washington Observatory.JPG|thumb|Instruments at [[Mount Washington Observatory]]. The pitot tube static anemometer is on the right.]]\n[[File:Pitot tube static anemometer.JPG|thumb|The pointed head is the pitot port. The small holes are connected to the static port.]]\n\n[[James Lind (1736\u20131812)|James Lind]]'s anemometer of 1775 consisted of a glass U tube containing a liquid [[manometer]] (pressure gauge), with one end bent in a horizontal direction to face the wind and the other vertical end remains parallel to the wind flow. Though the Lind was not the first it was the most practical and best known anemometer of this type. If the wind blows into the mouth of a tube it causes an increase of pressure on one side of the manometer. The wind over the open end of a vertical tube causes little change in pressure on the other side of the manometer. The resulting elevation difference in the two legs of the U tube is an indication of the wind speed. However, an accurate measurement requires that the wind speed be directly into the open end of the tube; small departures from the true direction of the wind causes large variations in the reading.\n\nThe successful metal pressure tube anemometer of William Henry Dines in 1892 utilized the same pressure difference between the open mouth of a straight tube facing the wind and a ring of small holes in a vertical tube which is closed at the upper end. Both are mounted at the same height. The pressure differences on which the action depends are very small, and special means are required to register them. The recorder consists of a float in a sealed chamber partially filled with water. The pipe from the straight tube is connected to the top of the sealed chamber and the pipe from the small tubes is directed into the bottom inside the float. Since the pressure difference determines the vertical position of the float this is a measure of the wind speed.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Anemometer Comparisons|first=W.

Two connecting tubes are required. It might appear at first sight as though one connection would serve, but the differences in pressure on which these instruments depend are so minute, that the pressure of the air in the room where the recording part is placed has to be considered. Thus if the instrument depends on the pressure or suction effect alone, and this pressure or suction is measured against the air pressure in an ordinary room, in which the doors and windows are carefully closed and a newspaper is then burnt up the chimney, an effect may be produced equal to a wind of 10&nbsp;mi/h (16&nbsp;km/h); and the opening of a window in rough weather, or the opening of a door, may entirely alter the registration.\n\nWhile the Dines anemometer had an error of only 1% at {{convert|10|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, it did not respond very well to low winds due to the poor response of the flat plate vane required to turn the head into the wind. In 1918 an aerodynamic vane with eight times the torque of the flat plate overcame this problem.\n\n====Pitot tube static anemometers====\nModern tube anemometers use the same principle as in the Dines anemometer but using a different design. The implementation uses a [[pitot tube|pitot-static tube]] which is a pitot tube with two ports, pitot and static, that is normally used in measuring the airspeed of aircraft. The pitot port measures the dynamic pressure of the open mouth of a tube with pointed head facing wind, and the static port measures the static pressure from small holes along the side on that tube. The pitot tube is connected to a tail so that it always makes the tube's head to face the wind. Additionally, the tube is heated to prevent [[rime ice]] formation on the tube.<ref>{{cite web|title=Instrumentation: Pitot Tube Static Anemometer, Part 1|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/clarkb/instrumentation/14828|publisher=Mt. Washington Observatory|access-date=14 July 2014}}</ref> There are two lines from the tube down to the devices to measure the difference in pressure of the two lines. The measurement devices can be [[manometer]]s, [[pressure transducer]]s, or analog [[chart recorder]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Instrumentation: Pitot Tube Static Anemometer, Part 2|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/clarkb/instrumentation-1/15065|publisher=Mt. Washington Observatory|access-date=14 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Effect of density on measurements===\nIn the tube anemometer the dynamic pressure is actually being measured, although the scale is usually graduated as a velocity scale. If the actual air density differs from the calibration value, due to differing temperature, elevation or barometric pressure, a correction is required to obtain the actual wind speed. Approximately 1.5% (1.6% above 6,000 feet) should be added to the velocity recorded by a tube anemometer for each 1000&nbsp;ft (5% for each kilometer) above sea-level.\n\n==Effect of icing==\nAt airports, it is essential to have accurate wind data under all conditions, including freezing precipitation. Anemometry is also required in monitoring and controlling the operation of wind turbines, which in cold environments are prone to in-cloud icing. Icing alters the aerodynamics of an anemometer and may entirely block it from operating. Therefore, anemometers used in these applications must be internally heated.<ref>Makkonen, L. et al. (2001) Anemometry in icing conditions. Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology 18:1457-1469</ref> Both cup anemometers and sonic anemometers are presently available with heated versions.\n\n==Instrument location==\nIn order for wind speeds to be comparable from location to location, the effect of the terrain needs to be considered, especially in regard to height. Other considerations are the presence of trees, and both natural canyons and artificial canyons (urban buildings). The standard anemometer height in open rural terrain is 10 meters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oke|first=Tim R.|title=Initial Guidance to Obtain Representative Meteorological Observations At Urban Sites|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/IOM-81/IOM-81-UrbanMetObs.pdf|accessdate=4 February 2013|series=Instruments and Observing Methods|volume=81|year=2006|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|pages=19\u201326|chapter=3.5 Wind speed and direction}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Nautical}}\n* [[Air flow meter]]\n* [[Anemoi]], for the ancient origin of the name of this technology\n* [[Anemoscope]], ancient device for measuring or predicting wind direction or weather\n* [[Windsock]], a simple high-visibility indicator of approximate wind speed and direction\n* [[Automated airport weather station]]\n* [[Night of the Big Wind]]\n* [[Particle image velocimetry]]\n* [[Savonius wind turbine]]\n* [[Wind power forecasting]]\n* [[Wind run]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*Meteorological Instruments, W.E.

Similar in size to a [[Eurasian magpie]], with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a [[raven]],<ref name=Erickson_etal_2009/> the largest species of ''Archaeopteryx'' could grow to about {{convert|0.5|m|abbr=on}} in length. Despite their small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, ''Archaeopteryx'' had more in common with other small [[Mesozoic]] [[dinosaur]]s than with modern birds. In particular, they shared the following features with the [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]] and [[troodontidae|troodontids]]: jaws with sharp [[Tooth|teeth]], three fingers with [[claw]]s, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes (\"killing claw\"), feathers (which also suggest [[homeothermy|warm-bloodedness]]), and various features of the [[skeleton]].<ref name=Yalden_1/><ref name=UCal_Chiappe/>\n\nThese features make ''Archaeopteryx'' a clear candidate for a [[transitional fossil]] between non-avian dinosaurs and birds.<ref name=UCal_MoP/><ref name=UCalg_Long/> Thus, ''Archaeopteryx'' plays an important role, not only in the study of the [[origin of birds]], but in the study of dinosaurs. It was named from a single [[feather]] in 1861.<ref name=Griffiths/> That same year, the first complete specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'' was announced. Over the years, ten more fossils of ''Archaeopteryx'' have surfaced. Despite variation among these fossils, most experts regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species, although this is still debated.\n\nMost of these eleven fossils include impressions of feathers. Because these feathers are of an advanced form ([[flight feather]]s), these fossils are evidence that the evolution of feathers began before the Late Jurassic.<ref name=weln_04/> The [[type specimen]] of ''Archaeopteryx'' was discovered just two years after [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. ''Archaeopteryx'' seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the origin of birds, the transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of [[evolution]].\n\nIn March 2018, scientists reported that ''Archaeopteryx'' was likely capable of [[Bird flight|flight]], but in a manner substantially different from that of [[Birds|modern birds]].<ref name=\"NAT-20180313\">{{cite journal |author=Voeten, Dennis F.A.E. et al. |title=Wing bone geometry reveals active flight in Archaeopteryx |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03296-8 |date=13 March 2018 |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=9 |number=923 |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-03296-8 |accessdate=13 March 2018 |bibcode=2018NatCo...9..923V }}</ref><ref name=\"WP-20180313\">{{cite news |last=Guarino |first=Ben |title=This feathery dinosaur probably flew, but not like any bird you know |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/03/13/this-feathery-dinosaur-probably-flew-but-not-like-any-bird-you-know/ |date=13 March 2018 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=13 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Archiesizeall1.svg|thumb|400px|alt=Archaeopteryx sizes ranging between about 25 and 50 cm long and between 25 and 60 cm in wingspan|Specimens compared to a [[human]] in scale]]\nMost of the specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' that have been discovered come from the Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria, southern Germany, which is a lagerst\u00e4tte, a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils laid down during the early Tithonian stage of the Jurassic period,<ref name=Lambert/> approximately 150.8\u2013148.5 million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schweigert | first1 = G. | year = 2007 | title = Ammonite biostratigraphy as a tool for dating Upper Jurassic lithographic limestones from South Germany \u2013 first results and open questions | url = | journal = Neues Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Geologie und Pal\u00e4ontologie - Abhandlungen | volume = 245 | issue = 1| pages = 117\u2013125 | doi = 10.1127/0077-7749/2007/0245-0117 }}</ref>\n\n''Archaeopteryx'' was roughly the size of a [[raven]],<ref name=Erickson_etal_2009/> with broad wings that were rounded at the ends and a long tail compared to its body length.

Unlike modern birds, ''Archaeopteryx'' had small teeth,<ref name=Lambert/> as well as a long bony tail, features which ''Archaeopteryx'' shared with other dinosaurs of the time.<ref name=Paleogeo/>\n\nBecause it displays features common to both birds and non-avian dinosaurs, ''Archaeopteryx'' has often been considered a link between them.<ref name=Lambert/> In the 1970s, [[John Ostrom]], following [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s lead in 1868, argued that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs and ''Archaeopteryx'' was a critical piece of evidence for this argument; it had several avian features, such as a wishbone, flight feathers, wings, and a partially reversed first toe along with dinosaur and theropod features. For instance, it has a long ascending process of the [[Talus bone|ankle bone]], [[interdental plate]]s, an [[obturator foramen|obturator]] process of the [[ischium]], and long chevrons in the tail. In particular, Ostrom found that ''Archaeopteryx'' was remarkably similar to the theropod family [[Dromaeosauridae]].<ref name=Buhler/><ref name=Huxley_1/><ref name=Huxley_2/><ref name=Huxley_3/><ref name=Nedin_1/><ref name=Olson_1/><ref name=Ostrom_1/><ref name=Ostrom_2/><ref name=Owen_1/>\n\n=== Plumage ===\n[[File:Archaeopteryx-modern bird tails.png|thumb|left|Anatomical illustration comparing the \"frond-tail\" of ''Archaeopteryx'' with the \"fan-tail\" of a modern bird]]\nSpecimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' were most notable for their well-developed [[flight feather]]s. They were markedly asymmetrical and showed the structure of flight feathers in modern birds, with vanes given stability by a [[barb (feather)|barb]]-[[barbule]]-barbicel arrangement.<ref name=\"Feduc 2\"/> The tail feathers were less asymmetrical, again in line with the situation in modern birds and also had firm vanes. The [[thumb]] did not yet bear a separately movable tuft of [[alula|stiff feathers]].\n\nThe body plumage of ''Archaeopteryx'' is less well documented and has only been properly researched in the well-preserved [[The Berlin specimen|Berlin specimen]]. Thus, as more than one species seems to be involved, the research into the Berlin specimen's feathers does not necessarily hold true for the rest of the species of ''Archaeopteryx''. In the Berlin specimen, there are \"trousers\" of well-developed feathers on the legs; some of these feathers seem to have a basic contour feather structure, but are somewhat decomposed (they lack [[barbicel]]s as in [[ratite]]s).<ref name=Christ_Bond_04/> In part they are firm and thus capable of supporting flight.<ref name=Longrich_1/>\n\nA patch of [[pennaceous feather]]s is found running along its back, which was quite similar to the contour feathers of the body plumage of modern birds in being symmetrical and firm, although not as stiff as the flight-related feathers. Apart from that, the feather traces in the Berlin specimen are limited to a sort of \"proto-[[Down feather|down]]\" not dissimilar to that found in the dinosaur ''[[Sinosauropteryx]]'': decomposed and fluffy, and possibly even appearing more like fur than feathers in life (although not in their microscopic structure). These occur on the remainder of the body\u2014although some feathers did not fossilize and others were obliterated during preparation, leaving bare patches on specimens\u2014and the lower neck.<ref name=Christ_Bond_04/>\n\nThere is no indication of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most ''Archaeopteryx'' specimens became embedded in [[Oxygen saturation|anoxic]] sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea\u2014the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, which suggests that the specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape ([[death pose]]) of the fossil specimens was achieved.<ref name=reisdorf2012>{{cite journal|author1=Reisdorf, A.

The feather was determined to be black throughout, with heavier pigmentation in the distal tip. The feather studied was most probably a dorsal [[Covert (feather)|covert]], which would have partly covered the primary feathers on the wings. The study does not mean that ''Archaeopteryx'' was entirely black, but suggests that it had some black colouration which included the coverts.

This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but it is unclear whether ''Archaeopteryx'' was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony [[Sternum|breastbone]] suggests that ''Archaeopteryx'' was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike [[coracoid]]s, or perhaps, to a [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[sternum]]. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between [[scapula]], coracoid, and [[humerus]]\u2014instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds\u2014may indicate that ''Archaeopteryx'' was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by [[Philip Senter]] in 2006, ''Archaeopteryx'' was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.<ref name=senter_1/>\n\n''Archaeopteryx'' wings were relatively large, which would have resulted in a low stall speed and reduced [[turning radius]]. The short and rounded shape of the wings would have increased drag, but also could have improved its ability to fly through cluttered environments such as trees and brush (similar wing shapes are seen in birds that fly through trees and brush, such as [[crows]] and [[pheasant]]s). The presence of \"hind wings\", asymmetrical flight feathers stemming from the legs similar to those seen in dromaeosaurids such as ''[[Microraptor]]'', also would have added to the aerial mobility of ''Archaeopteryx''. The first detailed study of the hind wings by Longrich in 2006, suggested that the structures formed up to 12% of the total [[airfoil]]. This would have reduced stall speed by up to 6% and turning radius by up to 12%.<ref name=Longrich_1/>\n\nThe feathers of ''Archaeopteryx'' were asymmetrical. This has been interpreted as evidence that it was a flyer, because flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers. Some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this. They studied more than 70 families of living birds, and found that some flightless types do have a range of asymmetry in their feathers, and that the feathers of ''Archaeopteryx'' fall into this range.<ref name=speakmanthomson1994>{{cite journal |last=Speakman |first=J.

Some scientists see it as a semi-arboreal climbing animal, following the idea that birds evolved from tree-dwelling gliders (the \"trees down\" hypothesis for the evolution of flight proposed by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O. C. Marsh]]). Other scientists see ''Archaeopteryx'' as running quickly along the ground, supporting the idea that birds evolved flight by running (the \"ground up\" hypothesis proposed by [[Samuel Wendell Williston]]). Still others suggest that ''Archaeopteryx'' might have been at home both in the trees and on the ground, like modern crows, and this latter view is what currently is considered best-supported by morphological characters. Altogether, it appears that the species was not particularly specialized for running on the ground or for perching. A scenario outlined by El\u017canowski in 2002 suggested that ''Archaeopteryx'' used its wings mainly to escape [[Predation|predators]] by glides punctuated with shallow downstrokes to reach successively higher perches, and alternatively, to cover longer distances (mainly) by gliding down from cliffs or treetops.<ref name=Elzanowski2002/>\n\n=== Growth ===\n[[File:Archaeopteryx growth curve.jpg|thumb|left|Growth trends compared with other dinosaurs and birds]]\n\nA [[histological]] study by Erickson, Norell, Zhongue, and others in 2009 estimated that ''Archaeopteryx'' grew relatively slowly compared to modern birds, presumably because the outermost portions of ''Archaeopteryx'' bones appear poorly vascularized;<ref name=Erickson_etal_2009/> in living vertebrates, poorly vascularized bone is correlated with slow growth rate. They also assume that all known skeletons of ''Archaeopteryx'' come from juvenile specimens. Because the bones of ''Archaeopteryx'' could not be histologically sectioned in a formal skeletochronological (growth ring) analysis, Erickson and colleagues used bone vascularity (porosity) to estimate bone growth rate. They assumed that poorly vascularized bone grows at similar rates in all birds and in ''Archaeopteryx''. The poorly vascularized bone of ''Archaeopteryx'' might have grown as slowly as that in a mallard (2.5 micrometres per day) or as fast as that in an ostrich (4.2 micrometres per day). Using this range of bone growth rates, they calculated how long it would take to \"grow\" each specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'' to the observed size; it may have taken at least 970 days (there were 375 days in a Late Jurassic year) to reach an adult size of {{convert|0.8\u20131|kg|abbr=on}}. The study also found that the avialans ''[[Jeholornis]]'' and ''[[Sapeornis]]'' grew relatively slowly, as did the dromaeosaurid ''[[Mahakala (dinosaur)|Mahakala]]''. The avialans ''[[Confuciusornis]]'' and ''[[Ichthyornis]]'' grew relatively quickly, following a growth trend similar to that of modern birds.<ref>''EurekAlert!''

The latitude was similar to [[Florida]], though the climate was likely to have been drier, as evidenced by fossils of plants with adaptations for arid conditions and a lack of terrestrial sediments characteristic of rivers. Evidence of plants, although scarce, include [[cycad]]s and conifers while animals found include a large number of insects, small lizards, [[pterosaur]]s, and ''[[Compsognathus]]''.<ref name=Chiappe_07/>\n\nThe excellent preservation of ''Archaeopteryx'' fossils and other terrestrial fossils found at [[Solnhofen]] indicates that they did not travel far before becoming preserved.<ref name=Davis_1/> The ''Archaeopteryx'' specimens found were therefore likely to have lived on the low islands surrounding the Solnhofen lagoon rather than to have been corpses that drifted in from farther away. ''Archaeopteryx'' skeletons are considerably less numerous in the deposits of Solnhofen than those of pterosaurs, of which seven genera have been found.<ref name=Bartell_90/> The pterosaurs included species such as ''[[Rhamphorhynchus (pterosaur)|Rhamphorhynchus]]'' belonging to the [[Rhamphorhynchidae]], the group which dominated the [[Ecological niche|niche]] currently occupied by [[seabird]]s, and which became extinct at the end of the Jurassic.

This is generally assigned to ''Archaeopteryx'' and was the initial [[holotype]], but whether it is a feather of this species, or another, as yet undiscovered, proto-bird is unknown. There are some indications it is not from the same animal as most of the skeletons (the \"typical\" ''A. lithographica'').<ref name=Griffiths/>\n\nThe first skeleton, known as the '''London Specimen''' (BMNH 37001),<ref name=BMNH_37001/> was unearthed in 1861 near [[Langenaltheim]], Germany, and perhaps given to local physician Karl H\u00e4berlein in return for medical services. He then sold it for \u00a3700 to the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London, where it remains.<ref name=Chiappe_07/> Missing most of its head and neck, it was described in 1863 by [[Richard Owen]] as ''Archaeopteryx macrura'', allowing for the possibility it did not belong to the same species as the feather. In the subsequent fourth edition of his ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'',<ref name=Darwin_1/> [[Charles Darwin]] described how some authors had maintained \"that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the ''Archaeopteryx'', with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the oolitic slates of Solnhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world.\"<ref name=Darwin_2/>\n\nThe [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term \"pteryx\" ({{lang|el|\u03c0\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03c5\u03be}}) primarily means \"wing\", but can also designate merely \"feather\". Meyer suggested this in his description. At first he referred to a single feather which appeared to resemble a modern bird's [[Flight feather|remex]] (wing feather), but he had heard of and been shown a rough sketch of the [[London]] specimen, to which he referred as a \"''Skelett eines mit \u00e4hnlichen Federn bedeckten {{lang|de|Tieres}}''\" (\"skeleton of an animal covered in similar feathers\"). In German, this ambiguity is resolved by the term ''Schwinge'' which does not necessarily mean a wing used for flying. ''Urschwinge'' was the favoured translation of ''Archaeopteryx'' among German scholars in the late nineteenth century. In English, \"ancient pinion\" offers a rough approximation.\n\nSince then twelve specimens have been recovered:\n\nThe '''Berlin Specimen''' (HMN 1880/81) was discovered in 1874 or 1875 on the Blumenberg near [[Eichst\u00e4tt]], Germany, by farmer Jakob Niemeyer. He sold this precious [[fossil]] for the money to buy a cow in 1876, to innkeeper Johann D\u00f6rr, who again sold it to Ernst Otto H\u00e4berlein, the son of K. H\u00e4berlein. Placed on sale between 1877 and 1881, with potential buyers including [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O. C.

Ten names have been published for the handful of specimens. As interpreted today, the name ''A. lithographica'' only referred to the single feather described by [[Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer|Meyer]]. In 1954 [[Gavin de Beer]] concluded that the London specimen was the [[holotype]]. In 1960, Swinton accordingly proposed that the name ''Archaeopteryx lithographica'' be placed on the official genera list making the alternative names ''Griphosaurus'' and ''Griphornis'' invalid.<ref name=Swinton/> The [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]], implicitly accepting de Beer's standpoint, did indeed suppress the plethora of alternative names initially proposed for the first skeleton specimens,<ref name=ICZN_1961/> which mainly resulted from the acrimonious dispute between Meyer and his opponent [[Johann Andreas Wagner]] (whose ''Griphosaurus problematicus'' \u2013 \"problematic [[riddle]]-lizard\" \u2013 was a vitriolic sneer at Meyer's ''Archaeopteryx'').<ref name=Wagner_1/> In addition, in 1977, the Commission ruled that the first species name of the Haarlem specimen, ''crassipes'', described by Meyer as a [[pterosaur]] before its true nature was realized, was not to be given preference over ''lithographica'' in instances where scientists considered them to represent the same species.<ref name=UCal_MoP/><ref name=ICZN_1977/>\n\nIt has been noted that the feather, the first specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'' described, does not correspond well with the flight-related feathers of ''Archaeopteryx''. It certainly is a [[flight feather]] of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of [[feathered dinosaur|feathered theropod]], of which only this feather is known so far.<ref name=Griffiths/> As the feather had been designated the [[Biological type|type specimen]], the name ''Archaeopteryx'' should then no longer be applied to the skeletons, thus creating significant [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|nomenclatorial]] confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or [[neotype]].<ref name=icznneotype>{{cite journal | last1 = Bock | first1 = W.

In particular, the Munich, Eichst\u00e4tt, Solnhofen, and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth, and possible presence of a sternum. Due to these differences, most individual specimens have been given their own species name at one point or another. The Berlin specimen has been designated as ''Archaeornis siemensii'', the Eichst\u00e4tt specimen as ''Jurapteryx recurva'', the Munich specimen as ''Archaeopteryx bavarica'', and the Solnhofen specimen as ''Wellnhoferia grandis''.<ref name=Elzanowski2002/>\n\nIn 2007, a review of all well-preserved specimens including the then-newly discovered Thermopolis specimen concluded that two distinct species of ''Archaeopteryx'' could be supported: ''A. lithographica'' (consisting of at least the London and Solnhofen specimens), and ''A. siemensii'' (consisting of at least the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens). The two species are distinguished primarily by large flexor tubercles on the foot claws in ''A. lithographica'' (the claws of ''A. siemensii'' specimens being relatively simple and straight). ''A. lithographica'' also had a constricted portion of the crown in some teeth and a stouter metatarsus. A supposed additional species, ''Wellnhoferia grandis'' (based on the Solnhofen specimen), seems to be indistinguishable from ''A. lithographica'' except in its larger size.<ref name=10th_find/>\n\n=== Synonyms ===\n[[File:Eichst\u00e4tt Wellnhoferia grandis.jpg|thumb|upright|The Solnhofen Specimen, by some considered as belonging to the genus ''[[Wellnhoferia]]'']]\nIf two names are given, the first denotes the original describer of the \"species\", the second the author on whom the given name combination is based.

Charig]] and others at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum in London]].<ref name=ACetal86/> Most of their evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of [[lithification]]; for example, they proposed that, based on the difference in texture associated with the feathers, feather impressions were applied to a thin layer of [[cement]],<ref name=RSW_85a/> without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference.<ref name=ACetal86/> They also misinterpreted the fossils, claiming that the tail was forged as one large feather,<ref name=RSW_85a/> when visibly this is not the case.<ref name=ACetal86/> In addition, they claimed that the other specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' known at the time did not have feathers,<ref name=Hoyle_85/><ref name=RSW_85a/> which is incorrect; the Maxberg and Eichst\u00e4tt specimens have obvious feathers.<ref name=ACetal86/>\n\nThey also expressed disbelief that slabs would split so smoothly, or that one half of a slab containing fossils would have good preservation, but not the [[counterslab]].<ref name=\"Hoyle_85\" /><ref name=\"RSW_85b\" /> These are common properties of Solnhofen fossils, because the dead animals would fall onto hardened surfaces, which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along and would leave the bulk of the fossil on one side and little on the other.<ref name=\"ACetal86\" />\n\nFinally, the motives they suggested for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; one is that [[Richard Owen]] wanted to forge evidence in support of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.<ref name=\"Talk_Origin_1\" />\n\nCharig ''et al.'' pointed to the presence of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original.<ref name=ACetal86/> Spetner ''et al.'' then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer,<ref name=LMS88/> but neglected to account for the fact that the cracks were old and had been filled with [[calcite]], and thus were not able to propagate.<ref name=Talk_Origin_1/> They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through [[X-ray spectroscopy]], and did find something that was not rock;<ref name=LMS88/> it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen.<ref name=Talk_Origin_1/> Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig ''et al.'' reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone \u2013 they say it is the product of sedimentation.<ref name=ACetal86/> It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities.<ref name=Encarta/> They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.<ref name=ACetal86/>\n\n=== Phylogenetic position ===\n[[File:Archaeo-deinony hands.svg|thumb|upright|alt=Outline of bones in forelimbs of Deinonychus and Archaeopteryx, both have two fingers and an opposed claw with very similar layout, although Archaeopteryx has thinner bones|Comparison of the forelimb of ''Archaeopteryx'' (right) with that of ''[[Deinonychus]]'' (left)]]\n\nModern paleontology has often classified ''Archaeopteryx'' as the most primitive bird. It is not thought to be a true ancestor of modern birds, but rather, a close relative of that ancestor.<ref name=\"Clarke&Norell2002\"/> Nonetheless, ''Archaeopteryx'' was often used as a model of the true ancestral bird. Several authors have done so.<ref name=Witmer02/> Lowe (1935)<ref name=Lowe_1935/> and Thulborn (1984)<ref name=Thulborn_1984/> questioned whether ''Archaeopteryx'' truly was the first bird. They suggested that ''Archaeopteryx'' was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups. Kurzanov (1987) suggested that ''[[Avimimus]]'' was more likely to be the ancestor of all birds than ''Archaeopteryx''.<ref name=Kurzanov_1987/> Barsbold (1983)<ref name=Barsbold_1983/> and Zweers and Van den Berge (1997)<ref name=\"Zweers&VandenBerge1997\"/> noted that many [[maniraptora]]n lineages are extremely birdlike, and they suggested that different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors.\n\nThe discovery of the closely related ''[[Xiaotingia]]'' in 2011 led to new phylogenetic analyses that suggested that ''Archaeopteryx'' is a [[deinonychosaur]] rather than an avialan, and therefore, not a \"bird\" under most common uses of that term.<ref name=\"Xiaotingia\" /> A more thorough analysis was published soon after to test this hypothesis, and failed to arrive at the same result; it found ''Archaeopteryx'' in its traditional position at the base of Avialae, while ''Xiaotingia'' was recovered as a basal dromaeosaurid or troodontid. The authors of the follow-up study noted that uncertainties still exist, and that it may not be possible to state confidently whether or not ''Archaeopteryx'' is a member of Avialae or not, barring new and better specimens of relevant species.<ref name=\"leeetal2011\">{{cite journal |year=2012 |title=Likelihood reinstates ''Archaeopteryx'' as a primitive bird |journal=Biology Letters |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=299\u2013303 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2011.0884 |pmid=22031726 |pmc=3297401 |author1=Lee |first1=M.

[[William N. Robson]], his instructor, a [[CBS Radio]] director/producer, submitted his script ''Now Playing Tomorrow'', a comedic fantasy about [[clairvoyance]], to the network, and it was produced in the [[Columbia Workshop]] series on January 30, 1939, with [[Shirley Booth]] in the lead role. It was Laurents' first professional credit. The show's success led to him being hired to write scripts for various radio shows, among them ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]''.<ref>Laurents, pp. 12\u201313.</ref>  Laurents' career was interrupted when he was drafted into the U.S. Army in the middle of World War II. Through a series of clerical errors, he never saw battle, but instead was assigned to the U.S. Army Pictorial Service located in a [[Kaufman Astoria Studios|film studio]] in [[Astoria, Queens]], where he wrote [[training film]]s and met, among others, [[George Cukor]] and [[William Holden]]. He later was reassigned to write plays for ''Armed Service Force Presents'', a radio show that dramatized the contributions of all branches of the armed forces.<ref>Laurents, pp. 22\u201328.</ref>\n\n==Theatrical career==\nAccording to John Clum, \"Laurents was always a mirror of his times. Through his best work, one sees a staged history of leftist, gender, and gay politics in the decades after World War II.\"<ref>Clum, John, \"The Works of Arthur Laurents: Politics, Love, and Betrayal\",  November 2014, Cambria Press, {{ISBN|1604978848}}</ref> After graduating from [[Cornell University]] in 1937, Laurents went to work as a writer for radio drama at [[CBS]] in New York. His military duties during World War II, which consisted of writing training films and radio scripts for ''Armed Service Force Presents'', brought him into contact with some of the best film directors\u2014distinguished director George Cukor directed his first script. Laurents's work in radio and film during World War II was an excellent apprenticeship for a budding playwright and screenwriter. He also had the good fortune to be based in New York City. His first stage play, ''Home of the Brave'', was produced in 1945. The sale of the play to a film studio gave Laurents the entr\u00e9e he needed to become a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] screenwriter though he continued, with mixed success, to write plays. The most important of his early screenplays is his adaptation of ''Rope'' for [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>Clum, John, \"The Works of Arthur Laurents: Politics, Love, and Betrayal\"</ref>\n\nSoon after being discharged from the Army, Laurents met ballerina [[Nora Kaye]], and the two became involved in an on-again, off-again romantic relationship. While Kaye was on tour with ''[[Fancy Free (ballet)|Fancy Free]]'', Laurents continued to write for the radio but was becoming discontented with the medium. At the urging of [[Martin Gabel]], he spent nine consecutive nights writing a play In 1962, Laurents directed ''[[I Can Get It for You Wholesale]]'', which helped to turn then-unknown [[Barbra Streisand]] into a star. His next project was the stage musical ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'', which he directed and for which he wrote the book, but it proved to be an infamous flop. He later had success with the musicals ''[[Hallelujah, Baby!]]'' (written for [[Lena Horne]]<ref>Laurents, p. 93.</ref> but ultimately starring [[Leslie Uggams]]) and ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage Aux Folles]]'' (1983), which he directed, however ''[[Nick & Nora]]'' was not successful.\n\nIn 2008, Laurents directed a Broadway revival of ''Gypsy'' starring [[Patti LuPone]], and in 2009, he tackled a bilingual revival of ''[[West Side Story]]'', with Spanish translations of some dialogue and lyrics by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]]. While preparing ''West Side Story'', he noted, \"The musical theatre and cultural conventions of 1957 made it next to impossible for the characters to have authenticity.\"<ref>Jones, Kenneth (July 16, 2008).

''[[Playbill]]''.</ref> Following the production's March 19 opening at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]], [[Ben Brantley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the translations \"an only partly successful experiment\" and added, \"Mr. Laurents has exchanged insolence for innocence and, as with most such bargains, there are dividends and losses.\"<ref>Brantley, Ben (March 20, 2009).

''[[Seattle Times]]''.</ref>\n\n==Film career==\nLaurents' first Hollywood experience proved to be a frustrating disappointment. Director [[Anatole Litvak]], unhappy with the script submitted by [[Frank Partos]] and [[Millen Brand]] for ''[[The Snake Pit]]'' (1948), hired Laurents to rewrite it. Partos and Brand later insisted the bulk of the shooting script was theirs, and produced carbon copies of many of the pages Laurents actually had written to bolster their claim.  Having destroyed the original script and all his notes and rewritten pages after completing the project, Laurents had no way to prove most of the work was his, and the [[WGA screenwriting credit system|Writers Guild of America]] denied him screen credit. Brand later confessed he and Partos had copied scenes written by Laurents and apologized for his role in the deception. Four decades later, Laurents learned he was ineligible for WGA health benefits because he had failed to accumulate enough credits to qualify. He was short by one, the one he failed to get for ''The Snake Pit''.<ref>Laurents, pp. 106\u2013120.</ref>\n\nUpon hearing [[20th Century Fox]] executives were pleased with Laurents' work on ''The Snake Pit'', [[Alfred Hitchcock]] hired him for his next project, the film ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' starring [[James Stewart]]. Hitchcock wanted Laurents to Americanize the British play ''[[Rope (play)|Rope]]'' (1929) by [[Patrick Hamilton (writer)|Patrick Hamilton]] for the screen. With his then-lover [[Farley Granger]] set to star, Laurents was happy to accept the assignment. His dilemma was how to make the audience aware of the fact the three main characters were [[homosexuality|homosexual]] without blatantly saying so. [[United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930|The Hays Office]] kept close tabs on his work, and the final script was so discreet that Laurents was unsure whether co-star James Stewart ever realized that his character was gay.<ref>Laurents, pp. 115\u2013116, 124\u2013131.</ref> In later years, Hitchcock asked him to script both ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' (1966) and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'' (1969), However, Laurents, in both cases unenthused by the material, declined the offers.<ref>Laurents, p. 136.</ref>\n\nLaurents also scripted ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956) and ''[[Bonjour Tristesse (film)|Bonjour Tristesse]]'' (1958). ''[[The Way We Were]]'' (1973), in which he incorporated many of his own experiences, particularly those with the HUAC, reunited him with Barbra Streisand, and ''[[The Turning Point (1977 film)|The Turning Point]]'' (1977), inspired in part by his love for Nora Kaye, was directed by her husband [[Herbert Ross]]. The Fox animated feature film ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997) was based in part from his screenplay of the live-action 1956 film of the same title.<ref>\"[http://forum.bcdb.com/forum/West_Side_Story_author_Arthur_Laurents_dies_93_P112699/ \"West Side Story Author Arthur Laurents Dies, 93\"] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120709071003/http://forum.bcdb.com/forum/West_Side_Story_author_Arthur_Laurents_dies_93_P112699/ |date=July 9, 2012 }} forum.bcdb.com.  May 4, 2011.</ref>\n\n==Blacklist==\nBecause of a casual remark made by [[Russel Crouse]], Laurents was called to [[Washington, D.C.]], to account for his political views.<ref>Laurents, p. 29.</ref> He explained himself to the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], and his appearance had no obvious impact on his career, which at the time was primarily in the theatre.  When the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]], which prohibited individuals suspected of engaging in subversive activities from obtaining a passport, was passed in 1950, Laurents and Granger immediately applied for and received passports and departed for Paris with [[Harold Clurman]] and his wife [[Stella Adler]]. Laurents and Granger remained abroad, traveling throughout Europe and northern Africa, for about 18 months.<ref>Laurents, pp. 165\u2013190.</ref>\n\nYears earlier, Laurents and [[Jerome Robbins]] had developed ''Look Ma, I'm Dancin'!'' (1948), a stage musical about the world of ballet that ran for 188 performances on Broadway, and starred [[Nancy Walker]] and [[Harold Lang]]. (Although the musical was ultimately produced with a book by [[Jerome Lawrence]] and [[Robert Edwin Lee|Robert E. Lee]], as Laurents left the project.)<ref>Vaill, Amanda (2006).

[[Internet Broadway Database]].</ref> Robbins approached [[Paramount Pictures]] about directing a screen version, and the studio agreed as long as Laurents was not part of the package.\n\nIt was not until then that Laurents learned he officially had been [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]], primarily because a review of ''Home of the Brave'' had been published in the ''[[Daily Worker]]''. He decided to return to Paris, but the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] refused to renew his passport. Laurents spent three months trying to clear his name, and after submitting a lengthy letter explaining his political beliefs in detail, it was determined they were so [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] he could not have been a member of any subversive groups. Within a week his passport was renewed, and the following day he sailed for Europe on the ''[[SS Ile de France|Ile de France]]''. While on board, he received a cable from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] offering him a screenwriting assignment. The blacklist had ended.<ref>Laurents, pp. 286\u2013289.</ref>\n\n==Memoirs==\nLaurents wrote ''Original Story By Arthur Laurents: A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood'', published in 2000. In it, he discusses his lengthy career and his many gay affairs and long-term relationships, including those with [[Farley Granger]] and Tom Hatcher (August 24, 1929 - October 26, 2006). Hatcher was an aspiring actor whom [[Gore Vidal]] suggested Laurents seek out at the [[Beverly Hills]] men's clothing store Hatcher was managing at the time. The couple remained together for 52 years until Hatcher's death on October 26, 2006.<ref>[http://www.backstage.com/bso/news_reviews/other_news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003345921 \"Backstage.com obituary, November 1, 2006\"].
